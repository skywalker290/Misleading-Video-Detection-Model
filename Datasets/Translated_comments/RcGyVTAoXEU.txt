Who is watching this video in 2024 

I watched this in 2024 at the age of 17 and this video dates back to 2013 when I was 7. AMAZiNG !!!

This talk changed my entire perspective on how we deal with stress. I just learned that we can be better at handling stress by not feeling stressed about being stressed.

This is probably the secret of the Palestinian resilience. They continue to care for one another despite of everything and that oxytocin strengthens them in unbelievable ways.

Okay so I got reminded of the quote if you cant change the problem change the way you think about it

Hello from 2024 

Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort

Coming back to this because my oldest sibling disagreed about how I viewed stress, but I decided to come back and review this video again. I&#39;ve always thought stress was somewhat meaningful and a part of life as long as I don&#39;t overthink it. Facing my stresses, without believing stress is bad for my health, can lead growing as a person as long as I figure out how to handle them (sort of like reactive coping, but with positivity). Glad to back to this video again!

I watching 2024

I’m here in 2024

For a medical student this talk is a blessing

She said the real thing that harms us is not stress, but the belief of stress. However, why do zoo animals suffer mental stress and die? They don&#39;t know what stress is, so they can&#39;t have a belief about stress.

Dear person whoever reading this, we may not know each others but I wish you all the best in life ! Stop blaming yourself, accept things and go forward. Your smile is precious  All the keys of happiness is in your hands, so open it up 

Here's how: "So, don't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will take care of itself. Every day has enough of its own worries!

I’m watching this video on Saturday, February 3, 2024.

i find it somewhat amusing how all of these &quot;breakthroughs&quot; in science are all basically found naturally in our primordial hunter-gatherer environment. Exercise is good, sunlight is important, whole organic foods are healthy, oh WoW! The modern world is toxic. Kaczynski was right

2024 still trending 

Caring creates resilience ... Caring comes from an open heart, and vulnerable will to connect with others.When the heart is in a defensive state, closed off, hurt, it wouldn&#39;t be able to do the job. The first step is to care about thyself, and practice mindfulness, by separating yourself from the experience and watching your heart, till it open up for you. By that you&#39;ll create resilience within you, since you care about yourself,  and that could be projected outward.  what&#39;s within is without.Check out sedona method, letting go pathway to surrender and there are many others techniques, cheers.

Just watching this now 2024  video is from 2013

Change your thought that &#39;&#39;stress is harmfull for your health&#39;&#39; is replace by &#39;&#39;stress make you healthier&#39;&#39;. This can change the way your body&#39;s respone to stress. It challenges your heart that make your heart stronger. Your blood vessels stay relaxed and remain stable and your heart is still pounding strongner that is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. Your heart has receptors for stress hormone, and oxytocin helps heart calls regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart.

How about caring about thyself. And caring about pets and plants. Should it be humans ? I dont think so

I am so grateful for finding this, &#39; Chasing meaning instead of avoiding discomfort&#39;

Well... i have seriously severe panic attacks and anxiety attacks thanks to years and years of googling my symptoms. Its very unhealthy but in the time of stress or having an anxiety episode, i cannot convince myself that im okay. Its not as easy as some people try to make it out to be. When you&#39;re in that moment you can only freak out and think youre dying just for it to drain you later. I hate it. This video actually helped me ALOT.

I feel stress about feeling stressed about stress

This is similar to a strategy I used to stop smoking. When I would get nicotine cravings, instead of dwelling on how uncomfortable I felt, I would get excited. I would think &quot;this is great, I can feel the nicotine leaving my system once and for all&quot; and I would remind myself how glad I was to be a non-smoker. It ended up making those &quot;nic fits&quot; feel great, because when having one, one does get a rush of energy. By redirecting that energy into a positive emotion, it ends up being surprisingly pleasurable. I got that tip from Allen Carr&#39;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking, btw.

I have this video for my final project in Public Speaking writing 3-4 pages on it

last statment hit me!!!!!!!!!!!!!   &quot;ITS BETTER TO GO WITH A WAY WHICH GIVES YOUR LIFE A MEANING AND ACCEPT THE STRESS THAT FOLLOWS&quot;

Why most of Ted&#39;s speakers speak and behave like AI bot&#39;s :O

Interesting that the video talk about mindset or response to stress......but fundamentally, proper mindset of how views ones  circumstances...may prevent stress, instead of  changing mindset towards stress...

CARİNG CREATED RESİLİNCE / PALESTİNA / PALESTİNA/ PALESTİNA /....
Best video ever
Wow. Exactly what I needed today. A refreshing perspective and study. Stress is good. Caring creates resilience.

Caring so much stresses me out
I entered this video only to strengthen myself in English conversation, but I was surprised by the topic and the way of treating mental illnesses in a scientific way, but as a Muslim I love to tell you that we have a cure for all mental illnesses, which is the Quran, and it is a cure for all psychological problems that only affect people who are empty of religious value

In the end, it all depends on how we perceive things. Focus is always being POSITIVE

<a href="">4:06</a> is that Bill Gates?.

Great advice!! Thanks so much

Thanks for great speech

I cannot wait to educate my friends and family one this and see what they say.

Caracaaa! A new perception of stress.
i love stress
As an emergency and critical care nurse this makes a lot of sense as another reason why we instinctually bond with our nurse colleagues

Love every speech in this channel, thanks speaker give me some useful advice.

Gotta throw away this garmin watch telling me I’m too stressed

WHERE ARE THIS STUDIES I WANT TO READ THEME TO UNDERSTAND FURTHER

Jesus loves you and wants you to accept Him. Receive Him today.

This can be a good way of thinking about it in some circumstances, but it also kind of just smacks of a privileged person who’s never had to deal with anything truly difficult. What good does my stress response do when my loved ones are dying, and there’s nothing I can do to help? What good does oxytocin do when I have no friends or family, or if I have family, what if they’re all garbage? It’s a generalization, but it feels like performative pseudo inspirational garbage.

I have been receiving a lot of stress for the past seven years, I moved to France!

Thanks, you are right that stress is bad for our health,  but how can I cntrolt it.

Amazing talk!

Shes awesome.

<a href="">4:09</a>

We are able to control our body with our mind(set). This TED Talk is a perfect example for that. So why not take it in advantage?

My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people / be happier and healthier. But I fear / that sth I’ve been teaching / for the last 10 years / is doing more harm than good, And it has to do with stress.For years, I’ve been telling people stress makes you sick. it increases the risk of everything from the common cold / to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I’ve turned stress into the enemy. But I’ve changed my mind about stress, and today, I wanna change yours.Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30000 adults in the US for 8 years, And they started by asking people: How much stress have you experienced in the last year? They also asked: do you believe / that stress is harmful for your health?And then they used public death records to find out / who died. Okay, some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. But / that was only true / for the people who also believed / that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful / were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk / of dying of Anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated that over the 8 years they were tracking deaths, 182000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief / that stress is bad for you. That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you / the 15 largest causes of death in the US last year, killing more people than skin cancers, HIV AIDS and homicide. You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I’ve been spending so much energy / telling people / stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering: can changing how you think about stress / make you healthier? and here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body&#39;s response to stress. Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend / that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It’s called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory, and you’re told / you have to give a five minute impromptu speech / on your personal weaknesses / to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure there are / bright lights and a camera in your face / Kind of like this. And / the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging non-verbal feedback.

I can’t believe this video has been available for 10 years and I’m only seeing it now. Thankfully Steven Bartlett referenced this exact TED Talk in his new book. My favourite part was actually Kelly’s response on avoiding or embracing stressful situations:“Go after what it is that creates meaning in your life, and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.”

So, this is why all meditations say be kind and gentle with oneself and others (most likely ignored by everyone) apart from focusing on the breathing (accepted by everyone).

An insightful talk that highlights the importance of changing our perspective on stress. The connection between stress, resilience and health is presented convincingly. A very valuable approach to address this fundamental issue in life and leadership.
Excellent video has very good information, it helps you how to prevent death from stress

everything is your mind 

sponsored by america

Good information but there&#39;s a lot of laughing at dead people who were just misinformed by &quot;professionals&quot; who claimed to know better.

I mean Wow….
Here are 10+ questions that follow the flow of the conversation:How many people here have experienced a lot of stress in the past year?What was the speaker&#39;s confession about stress?What study made the speaker change her mind about stress?Change in topic: Study on beliefs about stress and mortality riskIn the study tracking 30,000 adults, what did they find about people who experienced stress and believed it was harmful?How many deaths per year did the researchers estimate were caused by the belief that stress is bad, not by stress itself?Change in topic: Changing your mindset about stressCan changing how you think about stress make you healthier?In the Harvard study, how did viewing the stress response as helpful change participants&#39; physical reactions?Change in topic: Oxytocin release during stressWhat is oxytocin and what does it motivate you to do during stress?How does oxytocin protect your cardiovascular system and heart during stress?What did the study find about stressful experiences and mortality for people who spent time caring for others?How can choosing to view your stress response as helpful create the biology of courage?

&quot;chasing meaning is so much better than avoiding discomfort&quot; words to live by

I love cognitive behavioral therapy

O wow

One of the best Ted Talks, thank you!

So good!

Amazing video 
Chase meaning rather than trying to avoid discomfort

Rethink it. Reach out to people. Care for others.

<a href="">0:13</a> start<a href="">1:51</a> Some bad news...<a href="">2:59</a> you can see why ...<a href="">4:09</a> Now that you&#39;re sufficiently...

she&#39;s a good salesperson with a positive message, but some of the research sounds specious, vague, and unscientific.   That said I believe stressful circumstances are an opportunity for mindfulness and present moment awareness which can then decrease the stress.  my 2 cents

The very difference that some of us perform well under pressure and some succumb to it is the crux of this whole study.

Here are two knowledge objects extracted from the transcript:### Title: Believing stress is harmful increases health risks- Fact: The body responds to stress physically and psychologically.- Situation: Many people believe stress is bad for your health. - Cause: Viewing stress as harmful can produce a more negative physical response.- Approach: Reframing stress as helpful can improve cardiovascular health. Viewing stress as energizing creates a healthier biological response.### Title: Social connection builds resilience to stress - Fact: Oxytocin is released as part of the biological stress response.- Situation: Stress takes a physical and emotional toll on people.- Cause: Isolation and lack of social support during stress leaves people vulnerable.- Approach: Seeking social connections under stress releases oxytocin, protecting cardiovascular health. Caring for others creates resilience and offsets the harmful effects of stress.

This isn’t worthy of a TedX. This study that concludes that believing stress is bad for you correlates with higher death has zero data to support this talk.  At best the study infers that more study study could be helpful. It doesn’t control for age, health condition, and type of stress. Someone who who has stage four colon cancer is feeling a significantly different level of stress than someone who is stressed because they just started a new job. Older people tend to experience stress differently than younger people, but again, there’s no information about this in the study. There are MANY more questions that need answers before you reach the conclusion that she/this study conclude. Good topic with better study controls would be great, or ditch the study and focus the study on how to improve stress responses and how to differentiate between good stress and bad stress.

I’m wondering if I should save her presentation in a folder called hogwarts castle. 

What a great session! Thank you Kelly

Interesting concepts but it seems like they could only work with zero mental health disorders affecting a person.

This is not science this is non based theory

This is super helpful for me thanks Kelly

I fundamentally agree with the overall message that one&#39;s relationship to stress is more important than the actual levels of stress one experiences. However, the first study she cited seems pretty dubious because of an obvious cofounder. Think about the group of people who are stressed. There is going to be some portion of them who are physically healthy and another portion who are physically healthy. If you then ask these people if they think stress has contributed negatively to their health, it seems highly likely that the unhealthy people are much more likely to say yes because, well... they are unhealthy. I think it seems just as likely that being in physically poor health causes one to believe &quot;stress is unhealthy&quot; as opposed to &quot;believing stress is unhealthy&quot; causes worse health outcomes. The thing is, I do agree with the premise that stress itself is only harmful if you have an unhealthy relationship to it. I just wish she would at least briefly address this cofounder.

Wow! Actually eye-opening, profound talk. Feel grateful to have stumbled upon this one, for sure.

When I started caring about people, I was able to get over it 

Stress is getting me high blood pressure ‍️
What if I don&#39;t want challenges

&quot; Caring created resilience &quot;

This information is life-changing

I doubt it, I never see stress as harmful, but once you really experience stress, your body just react in a way that you cant even control it. I think your body tells you a lot more than what you believe

This is a great talk! I&#39;m wondering how many of the people who participated in the study were religious and what religious views they had. The vital importance of compassion and coming together is no news for humanity.

Amazing️️️️️
Eustress or distress - they are not the same.

Thank you very much. İt is very nice and very useful.

&quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than avoid discomfort...so the best way to make decision is to go after what creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows&quot; 

Great

I found a way to adopt this advice into my own life and openly follow this advice. (skyler tracy)

this video stressed me out.

Spoke to a few people at amazon.  This is what it&#39;s like.I don&#39;t want tor work in this envinronment.

Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change....

wow...... It was very helpful

Kelly McGonigal is mixing up correlations with causation.She knows this and she should be ashamed by misleading people about stress. In the american scientist mind is a review of her book the upside of stress. You can find this review by looking at the page of kelly McGonigal at wikipedia. The review is from Robert Epstein, 1 juli 2015.Two quotes: Correlation does not imply causation. This is a fundamental lesson psychology professors like me teach in introductory courses. Violating this principle can lead to serious misconceptions, even dangerous practices.McGonigal, a psychology instructor at Stanford University, probably teaches that principle, but in The Upside of Stress she seems to have ignored it. The book is a follow-up to a powerful TED talk she gave in 2013, which has had more than 10 million views online. Her message: I have been wrong in counseling people to avoid stress; new research shows that stress can hurt you only if you believe it can. .......McGonigal credits a 2012 study by Whitney P. Witt, then at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and her colleagues for her epiphany, but that study showed only that believing one&#39;s stressful experiences are harmful was correlated with illness and early mortality. That does not mean beliefs caused illness. There is a simpler, less mysterious way of accounting for the results: people who experience stress but who suffer minimal ill effects from it come to believe that stress cannot hurt them, whereas people who do suffer ill effects come to believe that stress is harmful. Voilà, we now have the correlation those researchers found but with belief as an outcome rather than a cause. McGonigal continues to make this type of error throughout her book.

I&#39;d have expected Kelly McGonigal to be Irish

You must watch this video until the end. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to a news commenter who discovered this video.
A not so short summary of my takeaways, hope this is useful: - Study showed that people who experienced a lot of stress but didn’t view the stress response as a bad thing had a lower risk of stress related death - lower in fact compared to those who claimed to experience little stress - The stress response should be viewed positively in that it’s your body priming itself for a challenge: when you change how you perceive stress, your stress response can change for the better biologically - for example, reduced constriction of blood vessels etc - Oxytocin is actually a stress hormone released in the stress response - encouraging you to reach out to people for support or to notice when others need support - Oxytocin also has positive effects on the body incl reduced inflammation as well as supporting cardiovascular resilience to stress - Study showed that people who cared for others or got support from others had a reduced risk of stress related death - Summary- change how you view stress, care for others in need, and reach out to friends/family in your time of need as this will have a huge impact of your body’s experience with stress. Don’t avoid stress instead chase meaning and trust your body will manage any stress that comes

it&#39;s very easy

the meat and potatoes = 7.00 minute mark

The US capitalistic society and corporations use employee stress as a tool to maximize productivity and minimize resource costs.  Stress over losing your job, stress over losing your healthcare which is tied to your employment, stress over low/no pay raises, etc.  Many workers put in large amounts of free overtime as a result, and are expected to do so.  Employees, their health, and their families suffer greatly as a result.  But profits must be kept high for shareholders.

<b>*looks around*</b> I still hate stress and I don&#39;t wanna feel any iota of stress lol

okay but damn is she pretty

wow.

It all makes sense now. How in Islam we are asked to give out in charity even if its a small date that we can afford and that always be content and grateful with what we have in our lives and show gratitude. How its k to be sad but its not ok to be hopeless. How to thank God even when faced with calamity (which is really hard to do) but it gives so much strength and courage to deal with anything and everything. It was an amazing talk btw

her answer to the guy in the last is on-point. miss kelly is a queen

<a href="">00:13</a> - start<a href="">01:21</a> - study: bad news - 43% risk of dying (182,000 deaths because they believe that stress could cause death)<a href="">03:17</a> - social stress test<a href="">04:13</a> - math test<a href="">05:14</a> - rethink !<a href="">06:50</a> - how you think about stress matters<a href="">07:45</a> - stress makes you social<a href="">10:54</a> - caring, resilience

The pounding heart not only boost your confidence, it also scares the enemy away.I call it the “King engine” 

Amazing presentation! will use for future professional development at work

There is Industrial management, Labour management, Cash management and so on. When the stress has to be released, why are the people teaching management courses designed <b>STRESS MANAGEMENT COURSES</b> in their curriculum? It&#39;s funny isn&#39;t it? 

Thanks for sharing; it is an amazing theme to understand and comprehend.

WHOA! I GOT GOOSE BUMPS

Stress is the body's response to cope with what is currently happening. Don't think it's a bad thing.
<a href="">0:24</a>

Ok, but that stress test had me sitting here behind a laptop all anxious

<a href="">0:13</a>

Stress is not good. Period

just belive in yurself bro

It reminds me of the words of our ancient ancestors: If you can't fight stress, enjoy it.
a beautiful and meaningful exposition on a subject that really is life enhancing and life changing. Thank you so much Kelly McGonigal.

Ok I&#39;ll remember share the stress with others

Why only 13 M views? I think the whole planet should watch this

I have seen other videos by McGonigal and like so many other speakers, the TED format is doing her a disservice. TED talks come as a kind of stand-up where the delivery is rehearsed to death and you can&#39;t escape the feeling that someone is playing a trick on you. At best it is superficial, at worst it comes across as deceit.The google talks format on the other hand gave a forum to her as a scientist/publisher to really explain what&#39;s going on in her domain and there was more genuine interaction with the audience. Strangely, these longer videos can keep my attention longer and I have a tendency to watch them a few times. TED talks are almost instantly putting me off - but if they work for others, all the better.

Some of what you talk about I have been practicing intuitively... Love this... confirms many of my feelings about this...

This is stunning

do I want to live in my 90s though..

Stress, although for many of us is horrible and terrifying, there are measures that we can take to ease the unpleasant feeling of ‘stress’, and turn it from something that may potentially kill us, into something that strengthens us and binds us together.

The kind of stress she&#39;s referring to is more of a fight or flight response. I think it&#39;s more about chronic stress that people associate with harm on health like losing a loved one, being bullied or something.

Andrew Tate was right

Queen.
Where do I find the research article she was quoting from?

Very interesting

Take a shot of vodka(drink of choice) every time she says stress

this was very moving &amp; it actually made me cry :,)) I have been really struggling with stress recently and this was just what I needed to hear!

Who else is here for an assignment ??

Came here to find the answer of how to get rid of stress?... Going with a promise to make stress as a friend

Lady needs to drink more water

thanks

This TEDtalk was life-changing for me

PERFECTO!

Around seven years after seeing this, I&#39;m here retrospectively to say a huge thank you, this has SAVED my life! Starting from a ridiculous, stress-induced medical file, I&#39;ve since been involved in far more stressful projects and situations, but with zero adverse health effects. Stress doesn&#39;t kill but fear of stress might...

Ms. McGonigal has been telling people for 10 years that stress is bad, now she has changed her  mind. Wow. Then she talks about oxytocin and we&#39;re supposed to understand how that affects our body. My, my. But we live in a powerfully induced stressful society so how do you handle all the stressful people and situations in your life? Especially since so many think stress is bad for you, this is quite a conundrum.

This is the only benefit to our prostrated broke education system. We&#39;re too dumb for it to kill us yet.

Wow that&#39;s profound!!!!

Thank you Kelly. Thank you for watering our hearts with love, care and the delightful &quot;stress&quot;. It&#39;s profound and refreshing to have learned this again and be reminded of how beautiful and magical our biological body presented itself. The biological courage that is ready to rise to the challenge for usThe intuitive and heartfelt human connection that cultivates and grows compassion and empathy with strength and resilienceAll these beautiful presents are embodied in our body, mind and soul. Thank you for such a thoughtful and generous lesson to pump our heart and life with courage, light and hope.  Thank you Kelly for redefining the meaning of stress for us all.  May we grow into our better selves along the journey ️

It&#39;s an useful point of view contrary to many people. I decided that I WILL change my view point like you. Thanks

So tired of American mentality talks, all concerned in how to turn the entire humanity into a more performing troup of marines regarding every aspect of life. More efficient about being healthy, more efficient about being loved, more efficient about being stressed.

I have loved her closing speech &quot;you don&#39;t have to face them alone&quot; ...

Pp

Watch the video and answer the following questions: 

At the beginning of her talk, the speaker says there&#39;s something she fears. What does she fear?

Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?

The speaker says her goal as a health psychologist has changed. How has it changed?

Thank you so much

If stress doesn&#39;t kill you, it makes you stronger

I don't understand English at all, but it had Japanese subtitles and the content was interesting, so it was eye-opening 
I heard Mr. Diana with empty ears. It seems that the man of your destiny is at the Senzu Post Office in Kawanehon Town.
Religion to a devout believer has the same effect. Mind over Matter.

It's called mindfulness, but your skin is really beautiful. She seems to be looking at a princess. Mastered metacognition. I can only feel grateful to have met one of the Japanese people. thank you.
This is interesting. Thank you.
I rarely experience stressMe after one bar of lorazepam

I have a confession to make. But first, I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you&#39;ve experienced relatively little stress. Anyone?<a href="">00:20</a>How about a moderate amount of stress?<a href="">00:23</a>Who has experienced a lot of stress? Yeah. Me too.<a href="">00:28</a>But that is not my confession. My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I&#39;ve been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress. For years I&#39;ve been telling people, stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I&#39;ve turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours.<a href="">01:09</a>Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, &quot;How much stress have you experienced in the last year?&quot; They also asked, &quot;Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?&quot; And then they used public death records to find out who died.<a href="">01:37</a>Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.

Latter-day Saints have been talking about joy in the journey and smiling through storms for more than a century. I think this is part of why we have generally had better health (not to mention our word of wisdom).Our attitude of gratitude,and encouraging to serve; both serve to make us good at healthy stress.

did she just point out how easily research directors can influence not only the answers to questions but also the results of a study? People trained in high level manipulation psychology would most likely be very good at this.Ridiculous we dont account for this. Such Left Brain Only thinking in science ruins it. Atheists hate God so they are not open to the idea in Science.

  One of The Best 

My European colleagues from Slovenia said this video not suit to Europe people life style … they can’t suffer too much ..

Thanks kelly

Not gonna lie, at the first statement (that if you don&#39;t believe stress, it&#39;s not bad for you, based on that one study) I rolled my eyes and started to discount the value of this TED talk, and I paused it, and walked away ... A day later, after pondering where she might be going with this, I went back to finish watching it.Absolutely right about Oxytocin. Oddly, it also tends to increase jealousy. I particularly found the closing statement most intriguing; packed with meaning!I have already made it a practice to change my perspective on a stressful situation by viewing it as an adventure. Just that shift in perspective allows me to apply myself more fully to the situation, rather than gritting my teeth through it.

I clicked this because I thought the video was &quot;How to make your friend stress&quot; but she wrote the title to stress us

FUNNY!

“Caring creates resilience&quot; is gotta be one of the most thought-provoking and powerful sentence I&#39;v heard in my life. Great vid.

I wonder if Japanese people commit suicide more often because they don't get enough hugs and don't produce oxytocin?
Great video! &quot; Caring creates resilience &quot; and the impact to the bodies stress response was eye opening!

Q&amp;cffgghghggbgb gvI

Best thing I&#39;ve heard in a very long time. Love this!

I love how, maybe practical is not the word but like doable this talk is

Thereisonlyworkeverythingelseisanillusion

I came back to this just to hear her voice. No lie.

The best stress reliever and good sleep &quot;pill&quot; for me is the sounds of nature. Rain, crackling fireplace, mountain stream. Nature sounds work against anxiety and enhance nervous system function and human behavior.

I&#39;ve started making natural sounds videos for every one, hope it will help someone

This is so amazing. Great video.

This is another American stupidity! You wait for a poor people to be told and shown everything!
This is an amazing video, I watched it for my psychology class and this framing of stress brought a lot of hope to my future, I hope more people can find this video because I doubt there is anyone, anywhere, that couldn&#39;t benefit from this message

My project defense is tmr, this was very helpful.

how about focus on PREVENTING stress ...Stay Away From Other Species, forever.No substances is smart.Don&#39;t mod your body.

I'm forced to watch this video in class 
Summarized: I killed people by telling them stress was bad. I&#39;m not stupid anymore.

Heheheha
Omg she rocks

This is incredible

The conclusion is change your mind, make the stress became the courage, the challenge, the opportunity. Then you will enjoy it and make happy to yourself

Great video !

skyler?

I am nervous and my legs are shaking whenever I have to talk in public. I think that it is my weakness but now I think my body is preparing for me. I will not worry about my shaking legs no more. She teaches about change in perspectives and I think this idea can be applied to almost everything.  Whenever I think in black cloud, I will remind myself that the black cloud is not giving darkness but it is going to give rain. Well, yes, dynamic of perspectives, a lesson learned again not only by positive thinking also by scientific evidence. Thank you Tedx and Kelly.

My wife has been my biggest supporter and has kept me focused.

I like the study that social connections decrease the risk of dying due to stress. Stress values.

Inspirational ️
So when a shunned person such as a homeless person, feels the stress of isolation it makes them crave more of that which nobody will give them causing more stress, which makes them more needy/different/unlovable ...

Or it could be that people who are prone to mental issues like anxiety or depression are more likely to die, and therefore they think more about stress killing you.... While she has a plausible theory, there&#39;s more than one way to look at that, and it&#39;s more than just how people view stress. If people can learn to cope with anxiety and depression, they will more likely to live longer. What she described above is a paradigm shift about stress only, not anxiety or depression. It&#39;s a good place to start though.

Don’t let the capitalists see this
I have a confession to make. But first, I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you&#39;ve experienced relatively little stress. Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who has experienced a lot of stress? Yeah. Me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I&#39;ve been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress. For years I&#39;ve been telling people, stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I&#39;ve turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours. Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, &quot;How much stress have you experienced in the last year?&quot; They also asked, &quot;Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?&quot; And then they used public death records to find out who died. (Laughter) Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. (Laughter) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you. (Laughter) That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide. (Laughter) You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I&#39;ve been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier? And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body&#39;s response to stress. Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It&#39;s called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory, and you&#39;re told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this. (Laughter) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback, like this. (Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you&#39;re sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test. And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now we&#39;re going to all do this together. It&#39;s going to be fun. For me. Okay. (Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. You&#39;re going to do this out loud, as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go! (Audience counting) Go faster. Faster please. You&#39;re going too slow. (Audience counting) Stop. Stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. (Laughter) You&#39;re not very good at this, are you? Okay, so you get the idea.

An amazing speech, an amazing speaker!

Having suffered with constant unilateral, 4KHz pure-tone tinnitus for 45+ years and getting a recent spike (double the volume) that doesn&#39;t appear to want to go away, I have realised that stress is a big factor in triggering tinnitus spikes. It is amazing to discover that the human brain has evolved a very complex <b>system</b> to keep itself &quot;out of harm&#39;s way&quot;.It is like a very well tuned car - and can, so easily, get <b>out of balance</b> eg. the wrong fuel.I am hoping to change my attitude to stress and hopefully my tinnitus will go back to its baseline level.

Some people see jumping out of a plane as exciting while others freak out, yet the bodies response is the same. Mindset is where the difference lies. The blood vessel reveal is new to me.

Well!I&#39;ve just made tons of friends

That last QA section was absolute show steeler

Wooow this i amazing

Fantastic talk. I absolutely love when common misconceptions about topics are pushed away in lieu of new and more accurate or complete information backed by scientific research. This seems to happen consistently, as science in a large way &quot;catches up&quot; with intuition and philosophy, so to speak. Science is absolutely fantastic, and an invaluable tool for human and societal growth; but with it, we have to remember that our knowledge is always incomplete and ever growing. Believing certain things as absolutes, such as that stress is inherently a &quot;bad&quot; thing, in this example, is a very limiting thing to do. I am very happy that there is now science to support what I felt in my being for a long time, as I am, in fact, working toward trusting myself again. (Or that I have now discovered this, seeing this video is 9 years old now...)

I&#39;m not anxious. My body is revving up for me to tackle what matters to me. :)

I feel like most Ted talks are so cheesy. This one was really good

I&#39;ve been stressed my whole life, eversince I was at grade 3, during uni life, during grad school, and even worst at work. I got sick quite easily. And I still dunno what to do with it 

Mind blown honestly. I can absolutely see how this can be effective. Our brains are SO incredibly powerful. A belief can be beneficial or detrimental to your well being. A fresh new perspective on a matter that most of us deal with on a daily basis. Personal Summary: Think of stress as preparation to handle any given task. It’s your body’s natural response mechanism to allow you to do the task at hand. Stress is NOT bad for you, your belief about it is. When you realize that the stress hormone (Oxytocin) allows your body to prepare work hard, your life will change. Helping others with stressful situations can strengthen your oxytocin hormone.

I think maybe it’s the other way round. maybe the ppl who have negative responses and coping habits/behaviours think stress is harmful, because it is. but the people who have healthy responses to stress and use it as fuel in turn don’t see it as a problem. so I think the use in reframing your mentality is reducing your fear so you can actually start to reflect and change even in a stress-state.

wow I never seen , just amazing

Thank you for the information 

Thanks to this talk you are all helping a lot of minds up to this day. To this one Girl I love you are going to be very happy sooner genuine happiness on your path I believe in you, we believe in you. I love you momi

This is remarkable. This junk in the name of  studies and science and she had a &quot;confession&quot; to make.

Now I know I am somehow doing the right thing

the study sounds so biased....

Brilliant!

This video is of great interest to watch because it contains information that is of great value to all of us, and it deals with stress, stress mechanisms, and stress impacts. One sentence that got me thinking was &quot;it&#39;s not stress that makes us sick, but the belief that stress makes us sick.&quot; It makes me think that our belief in something so negative can have a negative effect on us. In the video it also discusses that it is most easy to manage stress with social activities, even research shows that when helping people who are under stress, the hormone of happiness in a person increases significantly. In this I assume that &quot;the helper of the depressed is himself and another stressed person.&quot;

OMFG i found this at the p e r f e c t time

Caring created resilience

it can be concluded that stress depends on how we respond to it.  Stress can affect the health of the body, the body will act according to what is happening in the mind.  Everyone must have experienced stress, so how do you reduce that stress?  one of them can pour out the heart.  after pouring out the heart usually the heart becomes calmer, and feels someone is paying attention.  Many people do not want to talk because they are ashamed.  it becomes one of the problems that can increase stress.

i really appreciate you

but I want a fatal heart attack as soon as I can, I&#39;ve had enough of this life I don&#39;t want to live that many years, it&#39;s not worth anymore.

I would say the single most important TED Talk ever given. thank you Kelly

I’m wondering if by stress being good you mean temporary stress and not chronic stress? I would think chronic long lasting stress like the death of a loved one or long term abuse would be bad for your health. Can you please clarify? In addition I show this talk to my students so thank you for all the great info!

In Türkiye, the situation is different. I want to have an insured job, be a civil servant, and have peace of mind. That's why we can't develop.
I am so glad I watched this video. After I watched this video, its really really changed my perspective about stress. This video is so relevant. I&#39;m sure everyone has been under stress for some time. And now, we may also be stressed. During this time, we must have assumed that stress is our enemy. We only know that stress only makes us sick. When we feel stress, our heart must be pounding, and it&#39;s uncomfortable. But from this video, I got a new knowledge that stress can makes us healthy. Why? When we change our way of thinking about stress, we can change our body&#39;s reaction to stress. In fact, all aspects of our body will respond positively to stress. How? The trick is that we have to get used to looking at negative things positively. Sometimes, we can not change the situation but we can change our mindset to handle the problem well by trying to understand them, approaching them positively, and adjusting our attitude. The point of this video is how we think about something can change the whole situation.

After watching this video, Not only do I love this - but I adopted this advice in my own life. 

Thank you for talking. I listened this talking while I am feeling so stressful, and this video makes me hopeful about my life and bad events.

Sorryxtoxcomment

This a a really great talk! Thank you!

How we choose to experience our lives is a matter of perspective!  Channel that energy to fuel your journey.

Summary of 14 minutes: Don't stress, it's harmful to your health. :)
Are you saying, that during lockdown, stres killed people because contact with other was missing?

The fact that Ms McGonigal didn&#39;t touch on Cortisol makes me doubt the veracity of her talk.  She also didn&#39;t talk about the level of stress related to the question of, is it constant and unending or periodic with adequate recovery periods.  I&#39;ve also never heard oxytocin being discussed as a result of stress.I worked in a bank environment for about 15 years (for one company) where the amount of work expected was ever-increasing, the rewards were slowly withdrawn over time, the ability to interact with colleagues was dimished year-over-year and the systems we used became worse and worse consistently increasing the knowledge base we had to acquire to perform our work.I do not seriously believe that my attitude being more positive would have helped me all that much so I&#39;m not exactly impressed with this &quot;just keep a good attitude&quot; nonsense.  I agree that a person&#39;s general outlook on life would help when positive and that interacting with others is generally positive as well; however, I become evermore skeptical when someone tries to shove a mittful of daisies in my face that were grown in manure.I don&#39;t mind others who disagree and found this talk helpful; however, I didn&#39;t find it particularly encouraging.  Ms McGonigal does seem like a nice person and well-educated as well so please don&#39;t come at me with that argument if you decide to engage.  I don&#39;t have an issue with her; I have an issue with the culture that seems to continually find new ways to increase society&#39;s stress levels.And everyone have a nice day.

She was getting emotional there in the end. And it was indeed a powerful statement to end the talk with.

I don't need someone's habitual desire economy to save money, but I don't understand how much habituation inflation is being covered or why it's so good by interfering with technological progress.

A wonderful and very valuable lecture and amazing studies. May God bless the value of science. How beautiful. You were amazing and creative. I hope to be like you one day.
Now I am more stressed about stress.. it&#39;s probably the reverse psychology in play 

Now my motto is: Caring Creates Resilience

thank you so much for such a wonderful presentation

This is the best Ted talk I have ever seen

Praise God
Amazing research and discovery

it is kind of laughing to anger eliciting situation

good talk about thoughts control and its relation to a biological effect . your heart follows your mind . its amazing

So, there was a nocebo effect on people believing stress was bad for them, so presenter spends most of the presentation reframing the belief patterns so people can receive a placebo effect instead… Did anyone else pick up the issue with this?Of course, I as a believer in the righteousness of the Protestant work-ethic, endorse this reframing, as it will allow us to say to stressed people, “hey it’s not the system that’s at fault, it’s YOU! You need to stop believing this anxiety you are feeling is bad and it won’t kill you. Now if you could work an extra few hours tomorrow…”

SO positive thinking is the key to deal with stress for a healthy life.

Thank you , your words were really valuable for me , they helped much,no more stress or worry️

Now I&#39;m depressed. I can&#39;t even stress properly

・When you feel stressed, think of yourself as helping your own development. ・Oxytocin is also a stress hormone.

&#39;You can trust yourself to handle life&#39;s challenges and you&#39;re remembering that you don&#39;t have to face them alone&#39;. Such a powerful statement! I wish someone had told this to my younger self.

After battling with herpes for years I finally got cured by Dr. Ikpoko on YouTube natural herbal supplement which I took for 21days. You are indeed a great doctor of our time

Excellent
Could anyone help me the name of the study of 30,000 US adults she mentioned at the beginning? Many thanks.

This is incredibly invalidating because you’re conflating stress and panic, leading people to believe that they can beat their panic by thinking themselves out of it.

Thanks
Her book completely saved my life.I had been bullied by my boss for years. I was stressed out but her book gave me a different view of stress . I understood it gave me energy then I took action. I successfully expelled my boss to the other brunch.

Video wasn’t created when I wasWar never mind

Stress is of two types : Eustress and Distress .It&#39;s obviously depends on ho wyou view it. As a threat or a challenge.

Yeah, like that one phrase: &quot;You&#39;re never gonna be ready for it&quot; which I strongly agree with because it&#39;s a matter of doing rather than thinking of doing.You can&#39;t finish reading a book if you don&#39;t open it.

Buy a small note book. Create five chapters in that book.  Chapter One draw a personality mind map with nodes of people factual or fictional you would like to behave more like, and think what they would do at challenging times during your life. Chapter Two write down your beliefs, even if they are nihilistic, this orients you existentially and personally in a &quot;meaningless&quot; universe. The fantastic thing is that no-one decides the ultimate meaning of this universe, only you as there is no ultimate meaning. You are free and this is your universe. Chapter Three, write down your small and long term goals with the understanding you may never achieve them, this will give you satisfaction and targets to aim for.Chapter Four, write down daily tasks and pleasures that will contribute to your reaching these goals. The pleasures you write down could be anything, but the point is they remind you why you love life. A pleasure may be a person, a place an activity, a book etc...Chapter Five, write down helpful rules to follow for example; maxims,  the golden rule, enjoy making mistakes, accept who you really are, accept that you cannot truly control your thoughts or the environment around you only your choice of behaviour, apply 75% effort worrying and caring in everything that you do and experience as that is the optimal level, try to reduce suffering whereever you see it... Put this book away, but know you can always refer to it when required.

I found out about a video from Anastasia Bryukhanova’s channel
Thank you so much!!!

Words can never express my appreciation &amp; love for you as i was able to defeat my long term genital herpes virus with your herbal remedy, Thanks once again Dr. kwaloe on you tube, You are indeed the best herbal Doc.

In my experience, I used to fear stress because of the often occurrence of panic attacks. I was always unhappy and felt lonely. Then I looked back at how far I have come in life, I noticed if life is always smooth sailing I wouldn&#39;t have grown to become who I am today.Fast forward today, I&#39;m still learning to appreciate stress instead of controlling it. Also the more I appreciate the moment of stress, I feel more accomplished when I overcome it. I am literally addicted to stress nowadays. Here&#39;s my personal opinion, when you start to be able to accept stress and appreciate it; everything becomes easier, confidence becomes better and you will be more accepting that everything is not perfect. Focus becomes better. And yes, I noticed that I have become more relaxed and caring of others during complex situations.

Why are they laughing so much?
Since you translated the video into Turkish, you should have pasted the Turkish subtitles at the bottom while editing the video, because the subtitles can be turned off.
Is there anyone coming for YKS??
Not an expert in mindfulness, but if you look at buddhist philosophy, these advices are pretty much already there: it&#39;s suggested to befriend any negative emotion that arises, accept them, then move on from there. The resistance against these emotions what causes the most suffering.

I study English Philology and at first my mind thought about syllable stress haha.

this video can be used to learn english 

Whoah now this a TED talk ! probably the most important and useful one I have ever watched, I for sure will change my opinion about stress and accept more challenge and hence courage in my life.

My girlfriend are suffering severe stress,because she was demanded to take part in a society activity which is boring.

Chronic stress and heart disease risks elevated by smoking, overeating and lack of physical activity and more destructive behavior. I love how her demographic logic do not actually included these.

&quot;Caring creates reslilience&quot; oh god yes!

If you can shift yr thought of stress ,you maight use the stress to make you become healthier.RIght?

Go after what it is that creats meaning in yr life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.When you are doing what is meaningful for yr life ,please trust yourself that you can handle it and learn to live with stress peacefully.

Thank you

Thank you Much ️️️️️you are a great teacher.
She speak really good with an amazing body language !

Our church already teaches the blessing of stress as do the scriptures.

My teacher wants us to listen to 3 Teds every two weeks. haha. That&#39;s helpful to my life and English capacity.

I think we can have access to our hearts and connect with each other and benefit from oxytocin without having to deal with stress. By just connecting to each other :)) of course if we encounter stressful situation it’s useful to know that connecting with others helps, but we should not attribute stress any merits.

she is a faking hord. she taught everybody wrong the first time, what makes she know any better.

After listening to this In my opinion taking stress as positive is like going against the grail, taking a beating positively.Could be done but beating all the indicators, pounding heart, anxiety and distressful thought is hella lot difficult than presented.

When I get stressed out I go to Walmart shopping popping then I go to Chuck E cheese for lunch and if that doesn&#39;t make me forget about what was stressing me out I don&#39;t know what will

There’s so Many Things this World has to offer That it’s just to much. For example your probably gonna have to deal with stress with all these things on your mindSchool/or workYour gradesYour parents and their relationshipKeeping secrets If your Parents love youGetting sleepPubertyWorrying about dyingWorrying about othersHaving Bad dreamsSome People have different hobbies so it could be more stressful or less stressful but I’m sure there’s 1 Big thing going on in everyone’s mind that is stressing them even the tiniest bit, Take a minute to breathe, Do Not stress. It could be something like Someone finding out your biggest secret that u didn’t want to tell anyone or Leading/Owning something For example if you own a restaurant you gotta worry about is the food good, did the customers pay, did the customers like it, is it cooked enough, do we have enough staff, do people hate this place, are they giving good or bad ratings, Etc I’m not sure just something like that or whatever stresses you don’t Think about it, and you can always have a mental health break, stay safe yall  I’m Not saying this is the things you would stress about it’s just something i might stress about.

Dr. Nicholas Colvard sent me the link to this video.

my family is toxic most of the time so I dont to spend much time with them ,does spend more time in  help poor people  or people at work or others you care about help ?

Looks a lot like Eo Sa =))
This is so relevant. Honestly I agree with her that stress prepares ourselves for life challenges. I have prepared and taken exams under moderate-stress conditions and the outcomes have been pretty good. Stress indeed prepares us for challenges- make us more focused and more productive!

amazing speech.. i had a totally new whole perspective on stress. great job Ms. Kelly.

Thank you very much for this conference. Powerful, clear and full of awareness.
how do they know that stress killed them? :S

Awesome Ms. May
A very happy home. Wishing you more and more success. Always follow and support you. ️️️
Great words! thanks! I feel that acceptance of our reactions to stress as a defender is a right way to live

ted talks are better than therapy

Excellent 
This is the best information, I&#39;ve gotten so far.

Brilliant

I fell in love with her

hi to the feu who are answering academic integrity day
So then it seems to me that the main point is positive thinking versus negative thinking is more helpful to your health. I wonder if there’s a correlation between worrying about cancer versus not worry about cancer and how it relates to people that actually get cancer and die from it? I don’t know just thinking out loud.

Lol snort oxytocin.

Now teach me how to make you my girlfriend

It feels like I'm listening to healing music. His voice is very special, gentle and emotional. Just watching the video is so good, I'm so jealous of the qaa crew that listening to it live will be times better lunn
I know this was 8 years ago but good grief her outfit is horrific.

Beautiful beautiful ️
&quot;Chase meaning&quot;. period.

&quot;Chasing MEANING is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort&quot; hits!

The queen is a lizard person
i have been taking some medicine to feel good in work hour time...but later realise when i am not stressed i am not actually focusing on the work that need my attention...i am just enjoying the moment...but later work progress get hampered...and later i realise that stress is actually good , it motivate us to take action...

Stress is bad for your health but it is not the worst.

Why are people hate me because I wanna be happier without stress. I I’m very irritated by the thoughts of the other people perception of me and it’s not good; I see I have problems mentally but I do not deserve to be laugh at and think most people do not react to the world under stress, I’m seeking help and when I do things that I need to to do to be a better humming I’m be told that I will be killed if I react in the way I once did I was wrong and I don’t want or need to live with the truth anymore what shouldn’t or should I do I don’t wanna live this way I want change? Marquis Wilson the artist

Stress is harmful to the body and the brain. Tons of research shows that. As McGonigal says, our thinking/beliefs/emotions to stressful situations can keep us from meeting the stress in healthy ways. Will take more effort than just thinking positively (can&#39;t change your feelings by thinking). Still very helpful to reduce stress in your life.

WOW best video EVERRRR

Yet you make mistakes under stress! Does it connect with the remedy ?

Treat stress as your friend , not an enemy . . . <b>Leaving a trace for my futur self,</b>

There&#39;s a flaw in her conclusion: Correlation does not imply causation: perhaps people who believed stress was harmful could feel stress harming them, that&#39;s why they got that belief. While people who didn&#39;t feel stress harming them didn&#39;t believe it. So the believers were actually harmed and died. So it&#39;s not the belief that killed them, but the stress and their bodies that are harmed by stress. So changing your belief might actually bring you more harm, because if you have a body that is harmed by stress and doesn&#39;t believe stress is harming you, you&#39;ll allow yourself to suffer more stress and die faster

What ifPeople with most stress tends to view stress as harmfulSo stress is still a killer

deep truth. i&#39;m compelled to believe it because it Works!! Thank you Kelly.

that&#39;s right.

<a href="">10:40</a>, unfortunately too many of us have no one.

seeing stress as a normal reaction of the body toward stressful situations can save our life.

broken into my tears.... self belief, risk taking reaching higher , expect better.... I am pushing myself ahead and upwards towards a purpose... I want to be the top tier elite with my math model that predicts the ultral rich&#39;s financial choices... I personally went thru how stressful it can be when there is  a timeline to re-financing/re mortgage and get a loan in order to close a deal... I can do it so can you!

Powerful, excellent
Taking help or Giving help will improve your health and boost immunity .

Amazing video! How to deal with stress is a huge topic. In my 15+ years of practice in consulting people I find that some holistic techniques are very effective - for example I use neurographica and kinesiology. What do you think about holistic approach?

This makes so much sense! How can you live a full life without stress? I&#39;m pregnant - do I need to quit my job and buffer myself from everything in order for my baby to be healthy?

I&#39;m nearly 40 :p any day is a good day to die.

thank u so much

Stress really helps me, when I'm under pressure I do everything better. But it also leads to the fact that without that catalyst, I become lazy and cannot develop my own strength :((
Are there any Russians?
10/02/2022 , today i listened to the speech that will change my life , stress is  no more the enemy, stress is my best friend , stress is energy , stress is here make me ready  thank you

blown away very beautiful
Useful information.

oh well, so stress has a bad influence on us, of course, but if we can take stress as a motivation that makes we can not only reduce the harmful impact on our life but also help us healthier. Moreover, if we have been through a stressful situation and we can take the experience to share it with other people and once again, we can feel empathy with other people. So that maybe stress seems very bad but we can change that by changing our point of view about it and the way we face it.

I don&#39;t know what you blabber, but if you beg around people for help, you will be in more danger. Ahah

When you trust yourself as the first step 
Awesome... enough said. 

Turn pain into power

If stress makes us flow, it should be a part of us. If it makes us stuck, it shouldn&#39;t be a part of us.

Any additional tips for preschool teachers?? lol

Thank you so much

,Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life&quot; (John 3:16)But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17):

This is BS. Do proper research.

Can someone please link to the study she is  talking about ?

Best advice I&#39;ve been given about stress.  Was being investigated for muscle and nerve issues.  After adopting an embracing attitude towards stress, my symptoms have come well under control.  So much better than trying to escape stress somehow.  Thank you so much.

Something is missing here. This science study, what if what they were asking was actually the difference between good and bad stress, assuming that difference? It explains the result in the study, but not the conclusion.

wonderful and so much thanks

I always suspected this is so, as I couldn&#39;t wrap my head around the fact that humans thrived living in the wild, surrounded by dangerous animals, and always on the brink, but somehow we get harmed by someone telling us we suck at math. Doesn&#39;t really add up if you ask me.

Great speech and helpful advice

beautiful

This helped me a lot I will look at my stress a different way now

STRESS IS A KILLER

Great talk, does anyone also think she looks like female Mark Zuckerberg

To live for a purpose.

Caring creates resilience. I love that!

Food, air, the atmosphere of life, everything should be better, then fatigue goes away.

does anyone have a link to the study she mentioned?

Yo this is life changing. I thank God for making me come accross this

Thank you so much for changing my mind :)

Post hoc fallacy (after this, therefore because of this).&quot;Those who believed in the harm of stress died, therefore, belief in the harm of stress kills&quot; it&#39;s like &quot;The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise&quot;.

If yall cant see the blatant gas lighting in this agenda driven designed speech then there is no hope for you.  Pure gaslighting propagana

The biology of courage is all one needs.

Mind blowing information and the way she presented it is all that took me freak out.

Great speaker

Hey Kelly McGonial Rich and Wealthy People dont have stress becuase they have lots money .

To those who has watched this before and revisiting again can tell does it work or not?

Drinking game: a sip every time she says &quot;stress&quot;

Oh wow, literally a life changer.

Thank you

Some points are good. But is it possible that people are also the source of stress?

She didn’t differentiate good stress and bad stress

Just remember fear is a illusion and you’re not your thoughts, your lower self is what wants you to be stressed, depressed etc. But your higher self is what tells you God is with you and you’re good regardless and that’s what you need to listen to, I even made a video on this and connecting with your higher self, stay blessed 

Wow, I loved it. What a profound insight   

I have always had a hard on for Kelly McGonagall

I am yet again amazed by my baaady

Wonderful speech !

Best of TED Talks 
What a dynamic speaker! You actually changed my mind about stress which I used to consider a negative aspect of my life. The point here is how we think about something can change the whole situation.

So she never actually cited any actual sources let alone multiple sources. Def a shill

The only decent TED Talk I&#39;ve seen.

Ogayyyyy
Now I am stressed about watching this now! Wasted 8 precious years of my life

That&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s 100  percent true   I  have experienced n  explained that  and simply  agree with your words   thanks  for a  very  helpful Reminder 

impressive and wise statements wow

thanks Kelly

Yo this talk hit different

My son shared this with me and I am very grateful.

I am just wowed right now The way she explained with the help of researches and makes you believe that yes it isn&#39;t that bad to be stressful, I just love it 

Sensational explanation!!! Always Learning. I improved by learning how to breathe to calm down!!!  Gratitude!!!
If this were true, truly rich and successful people would take care of others tirelessly. But unfortunately, they just live longer because they have access to better medicine, food and recreation.

I adopted your advice very profoudly. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Prof. Mcgonigol got some tricks up her sleves

How do you care when you don&#39;t care?

This talk changed my life. Thank you so much!!!

It has been over 8 years since this Ted Talk, why have I never heard about it from any of my counselors/psychiatrists?

so they just laughed at the deaths??

Ah yes nothing funnier than 20k deaths a year

What a great opening and amazing introduction!

I was thinking about going to High School instead of collage the next year and I was Hesitating if I couldn&#39;t handle it and I fail So why I don&#39;t go to collage like all my friends but the answer is clear now thanks to the doctor. I don&#39;t fear death no one should like the prophet mohamed said: live your day as you are dying tomorrow, and live your life as you live forever

most amazing TED Talk!!!!! Life changing
“Oxytocin is motivating you to tell others how you feel rather than just bottling it up”Haha well 

One might think that stress is always lurking with us. But stress can only come from our thoughts
Love you....I needed it the most

“Go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.”

Don’t stress about the stress

I&#39;m 15 and I have health anxiety...

I feel like now I’ll just be like ‘’stress is good for you’ but deep down I’ll be like but am I really believing this

me: debilitating social anxietyher: &quot;stress makes you social&quot;me:     
The Home Depot ad started playing and I’ve just been humming the Home Depot theme the whole time

The last minute is gold ️. Now I understand why even in a stressful condition I&#39;m still calm and happy inside. I have a meaningful life, in a place where my calling is ️

I feel like she might be interpreting the data incorrectly for that first study... Or maybe the researchers were the ones to do that. Because those who didn&#39;t see stress as harmful... Well, it probably wasn&#39;t harming them. Those who did see it as harmful... It was probably harming them. So the ones unharmed from stress had a lower rate of death, and the ones harmed from stress had a higher rate of stress. Unharmed dying less, harmed dying more. What a revelation /s. I just think that maybe they should look at what&#39;s right in front of them before jumping to conclusions, y&#39;know?And for the one about stress and caring for others... Wow! People with people who are there as support groups have a lower rate of death, and don&#39;t have any stress-related death effects? Wildin&#39; /s.Anyways, I mean no offense to this psychologist, but it just feels... like advice for a very certain group of lower-stress folks.

The research results are surprising, showing that when stress causes your heart to beat faster and cold sweat to appear, understanding it positively as a body response to overcome stress can change your body for the better. Through this study, I was able to learn that everything is really in the mind. If you accept the physical changes caused by stress positively, more oxytocin is secreted. At this time, the blood vessels are more relaxed than usual, and when the heart receives oxytocin, it even undergoes physical changes that repair damage. It's so surprising. Not only that, but this change also plays a social role. It stimulates the desire to surround yourself with people who support you. It is said that the more you reach out to people and try to understand them, the more oxytocin you will have. They say that the death rate is lower for people who care for and communicate with someone who is under stress. If you can trust yourself and feel positive and courageous in times of crisis, you will be able to live a healthy life. Also, having the heart to care for someone in crisis was a way to save yourself. I was very impressed with the research I heard recently. .
Anyone who knows which studies she&#39;s referring to?

Great talk It’s make me feel really good about my stress 

AMAZING!!!!

This is indeed a revolutionary talk, her talk is definitely going to save life&#39;s of viewer&#39;s.

No stressing or mad vibes inside turn out at a point

I’m starting to love all these Ted talks. Very informative

I wonder why Muslims have no stress, even we are not familiar with term. Despite of having economic, social, and financial issues we Muslims are as happy as if there is no issues in their life. I believe that peace and comfort in life comes through the connection between you and God. The more you are connected to Allah the better peace and blessings you get.So, invert to Islam and throw away the stress.

I thought the cortisol was a stress hormone 

Honestly I don&#39;t believe this as much as I did 3 years ago. I lost all my meaning and purpose in life, so being stressed out made me suffered. This only works when you have a clear goal and purpose. I used to be like this, my goal in school was to be the top students and get good grades, so this let me step on stress and achieve stuff.After swimming in the dreadful world of work, I lost all meanings, my goals and my dreams.

it saved my mind right now

Such an inspiring video... If not for WhatsUp recomending me this video, I would never have known! Its so great that I shall forever keep this in mind.

Wow 🇧🇷 I loved it
New director of Hogwarts is very pretty

I watched this when I was in high school and it gave me courage, and it's been a long time since I entered the workforce that I remembered it and watched it again. If I could change my way of thinking, I wanted to make the effort.
This is so profound. I have sent this individually to everyone of my friend group and my family. Basically,  “together, we can do this!”

You got me! A lot of people should know about this 

When you say stress do you mean  anxiety as well?

Amazing, it's a new perception WOW
Caring created resilience

Sorry, but in my experience this is total bullshit. I didn&#39;t wanted to be in a stressful situation neither I was thinking negatively about it. I was just exposed to it for a decade ... I was ALWAYS very corageous and I&#39;ve coped with the situation. I went for what is was meaningful to me. I never gave up and also now I am positively orientated toward my future. But as the  result of all the stress I get disease whitch I am coping with still now. So people... an briefly exposure to stress it could be constructive and positive, also thinking positively about the stress is a way to avoid the consequence of it, but once you&#39;ve coped with so many stress, believe me, you just want to be smoother and genle with yourself! A lab experiment or a social study is far from  real life! God bless all of you ️

This is my body helping me raise with this challenge

I love her, the way she handle the talk her paused and gestures.

Nice onee great advice

<a href="">3:10</a>

It was 8 yrs but still we&#39;re hearing &#39;Stress is not good for health &#39;.

This amazing woman helps me a lot.

&quot;and yes, your pounding physical heart, working so hard to give you strength and energy.&quot; idk why but that line hits me hard. it feels like my body already give their best, their support to me, so i must be so thankful for them.

I wonder why this video got 3.6k dislikes!

actually it&#39;s not. it&#39;s 8 years past and it appears she&#39;s wrong.  the study she refered was about short term stress, Not chronic one.

anyone with reference to this article, study ?? i would love to read it

You talk like that because you must not have passed the Algarve raisins... It's easy to talk when the stresses are small
My math/english teacher said, that we couldn&#39;t live without stress. His name was Neo Thomas Anderson Alex Alexander Sascha Keanu Reeves Christian Markov Burgstedt.

im stress with my mom and dad they give me too many tuisyen after school i gotta have tuisyen and then another tuisyen in monday,tuesday and thursday and i have to finish each homework from school and tuisyen im stress about it cuz im tired and always get mad when my homework isnt finish yet

This is one of the gays things we have to do for school

First YouTube comment ever. And it&#39;s a negative one. Dude. Correlation does not imply causation. The iceberg of success. The people that said stress wasn&#39;t bad new how to use it and then how to deal with it after. Crazy she gets to do stuff like this and then the whole world goes bananas. It aint just that, but the title is how to make stress your friend. She never said anything about how to do that. She never even talked about cortisol the stress hormone. Why is she talking about oxytocin? It&#39;s so cheap. Really bad, the lot of it.

I love it so muchhh

her prensentation is actually amazing . it&#39;s helpful for a lot of people because this is a big problem recently that Most people cannot  face to face and don&#39;t know what&#39;s the method to solve . so Thank you so much KELLY

Very good. Makes sense.

I understand stress can be a positive motivator. But I don&#39;t think my body is making me any more ready to do litterally anything today by creating so much stress I can barely move. Maybe this was a fair case when facing a predator. But I don&#39;t feel any more prepared to start drivers Ed when I&#39;m so stressed out I&#39;m going to absolutely collapse

i felt stress watching this vid

Excellent TED, and I don’t often say that.  Beliefs matter. McGonigal’s take on Oxytocin is more balanced than many I’ve heard. The one thing I wish she would have added was a brief note that there’s a difference between the brain’s natural Oxytocin and the synthetic oxytocin being sold in the market. The body responds to and handles them differently, and there is a difference between making a ‘best guess’ conscious choice on when to snort Oxytocin vs. the brain’s natural mechanisms that dictate when Oxytocin should be administered.

I directly ran to this video after i just finished her book &quot;The Upside of Stress&quot;. Her book is one of those books that life-changing to me. She reshapes my mindset over problems in life and stress

Wise words, thank you.  People who are positive can view stress as positive.  But whether we are happy or unhappy, wethey will eventually die and disappear.   Our mind consists of the pictures we build up in our minds about our life according to our habits.  This is our mind world.  We live inside of this mind world instead of in the world.   There is a meditation method to discard the lived life and habits.  If you do this, only the true world will remain in your mind.  When the mind of the world, which is eternal is in your mind, you can be reborn from there and live eternally.  I hope this video inspires you.  (38) How to Deal with Stress | Meditation - YouTube

Just amazing , Thankuuuuuuuuuu so much for such a wonderful scientific advice
Our brain is so much more sophisticated than us we mismanage it and use it against ourselves...

What controls vessels and blood flow is the brain, the brain tries to protect you from what is harmful so when you think that pumping lots of blood is harming you it tries to restrict it. Similar reason as to why placebo effect is a thing

This has really changed my perspective! I&#39;m glad as I have a condition that increases stress.

The cool thing is that stress makes you more social releasing oxytocin

If you change the way you think, you will change the way you feel.

She&#39;s hot 
Oh WoW wow wow, now that’s a beautiful and wise insight into the whole Anxiety-Depression paradigm! Very simply, and as I understood , the modern ultra-civilized society of today lacks compassion and empathy towards self, let alone for others. It’s also so harsh a critique of everyone else as it lacks, in so many minute ways , true self esteem! Materialism has replaced human Soul.

Yes preparing, learning to function under pressure.   Pressure not stress difference.  Pressure is an opportunity for success at something, it means your outside your comfort zone, use it to your advantage 

This talk stressed me out!!

Brilliant love you

(How do we deal with youth in the face of renewed challenges?)  The sage must take all the reasons for cultural inhibition when dealing with the problems that exist today in light of the issues at the table of public responsibility, which are the concerns of parents and officials.  Let us take the problem of amplifying the void of the modern generation after college or during official holidays, such as being outside the awareness of the family and outside the eyes of the law. Errors cannot be observed because they are far from being noticed.  Therefore, we do not want to go into the details of the dilemmas, but we do want to develop permanent solutions, not temporary, as politicians do, we have to ask the intellectuals because they develop sustainable solutions.  All youth sponsoring organizations must develop a strategy that is in line with the new desires of young people.  The halls are open for young people to gather in their spare time and experts in criminology and psychology are brought in to give free lectures.  - Preparing the various dining tables after the end of the lectures to attend in order to attract the largest possible number of young people, because bridging hunger is more important than the well-being of many of the new generation.  - Giving new singers opportunities to sing after the lectures, and the painters to set up a mini-exhibition after the lectures for the purpose of selling and advertising, because singing is a factor that attracts young people.  Doing and replicating these methods in all cities serves all segments of society and prevents common mistakes. ALI SUROOR

So how about the cortisol?

Good stress

This really helps a lot!

Very good! I use this video in my classes. ️

Is it possible that the people who viewed stress as harmful were those who had chronic underlying conditions that were exacerbated by stress? Thus leading to their belief?

Great talk! Thanks!
I think have two ways with stress, first you become stronger than it and overcome, second and almost we not good to choice first. Second way is adapt with it, fight but not good result, forgot is not efective resolution because forget not need effort and need effort can&#39;t call that gorget. Love you and wish best thing with you.

now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 americans died prematurely  not from  stress , but from the belief that stress is bad for you &lt;laughter.

I just love this one alot !

Thank you very much for sharing this video with us. Great video, full of contents. I wish you good health and more prosperity. Looking forward to watching more of your videos.  ️

Where do I learn more about this new research-based approach to stress and how to implement it?

I can make a good relationship with my stomachache, right? Thanks

yes how does this fix my anxiety disorder

Beautiful, I loved it, I will listen to it more often
Great advise.

Just Wow 

I found this TedTalk to be interesting and helpful in managing stress while facing it in a different light. I am shocked that 3.4K people thought otherwise. Whether you agree or disagree, may you care to share your personal thoughts about this TedTalk and topic? I am interested in your insights.

Thank you

Fake talk, speaker hired by corporates to motivate employees take more stress. Prove me wrong.

hello this is very good video......my son was suffering from stress and we took medicines from planet ayurveda and now he is ok. Thanks to planet ayurveda.

very insightful talk!

one of the best Talk and motivating speeches for me

Sometimes I feel lots of strain on my heart be cause of stress; Hope I won&#39;t die be cause of stroke before I achieve my goals

Did anyone else somehow read this in like a Russian/Borat accent, and understand it was going to be a video about how to stress your friend out?

Lol Audience was laughing thinking she was joking

my favorite ted talk ever
Caring created resilience
<a href="">10:20</a> - Did she mean to say &quot;physical contact and social support&quot;?

disgusting watching rich idiots try and learn what it means to be human from staged lectures...   TED talks are just public think tank exposure...   you can learn if you want to learn, going to a talk doesn&#39;t indemnify you or make a better person out of you unless you actualize it.How many of the audience members will actually progressively change the world..?I doubt many...

Which stress is she talking tho ? The chronicle or acute one ?

i like this i can learn English on this

This was cool.

This sounds very compelling, but it strikes me as a very privileged position. The findings and her hypothesis are very lovely to hear, but working among a population that faces chronic, systemic stress makes me skeptical whether her hypothesis can be generalized. Try telling someone who grew up with complex PTSD and lifelong poverty and disenfranchisement that they should see their stress as a helpful nudge - I&#39;m not about to tell my clients that, not when the stress is the threat of gun violence on their doorstep or the final notice on rent they cannot pay.I heartily agree with her that human connection is a huge protective factor. But life is a lot more complex than that.

Love this message !

Again, amazing talk, but stress might be also addictive. So, it&#39;s a really good and useful ted talk, but we should still be very careful. I&#39;m writing this currently in sick-leave, due to? overwork/stress. As a scholar, all the professional told me, this is very common in your profession. So, let&#39;s remain very careful and indeed when you have to face a stressful situation, those are great advice

I was searching for how to make your friend stressed and this was at the top

Drinking game: take a shot every time she says, “stress”

Please give me a reflection about this video &quot;how to make your friend&quot;

<a href="">14:21</a>It&#39;s amazing how the guy on stage thanked her, changed his shirt, then went into the audience to clap for her.

You have stress because you don&#39;t follow Jesus the right way. You will have the right job with happiness. And Happiness will make you do things successfully. Stress comes from the devil. There is no positive or negative stress, all stress is negative. The same way, there are no positive or negative evils, evils are just negative.  Take things with happiness and confidence and done ! Faith is not related to stress, Faith is more than that. So this presentation may be important for non-believers. But if you are a believer, consider my opinion.

Does anyody knows the name of this study? So interesting!

i like this one

<a href="">9:56</a>

Who came here from fearless man

The word &quot;stress&quot; makes me writhe ; (

Who’s here bc of school?

i call total bullshit

She should definitely clarify that this only applies to short term stress. Having short term stress to turn in a paper and do an assignment is very helpful. But as a person with anxiety, long sustained stress that can happen for what seems like no reason is not beneficial for your health at all. Anxiety can often lead to depression which is not something that &quot;helps you connect with people to receive help&quot; it actually really does effect you and you most of the time cannot just &#39;control it&#39;. It&#39;s important that this argument doesn&#39;t invalidate people who have  mental illness.

Its gest showing that what is kiling you is your mind and if you dont control it you are in big problom

Wow! Such simple and wonderful talk. This will help so many people. Thank you Kelly!!

Very useful, relevant now, more than ever.

why did that dude come on the stage at the end? Like he was running something she gave an amazing speech. there was no need for him to question her in front of everyone like that but she handled it well.

I saw &quot;How to make your friend stressed&quot; and I&#39;m here  :)

Thank you

I don&#39;t really know if this applies to everyone.. I mean when you&#39;re under stress, especially at a life-and-death situations, you should be looking for yourself first instead of others because it is our instinct to survive, while stress adds up here to fuel ourselves up to save our own bodies away from harm.Also, I don&#39;t know how can you still manage to help others when you are under pressure, like when you are under a strict deadline, how can you manage to help someone when they might be a bother to your time? Not everyone can handle stress well and be calm under pressure, right? So as this kind of person, how can I empathize and be kind under stress?

I guess I&#39;m gonna think about this talk a lot and spend more time with my family

Aka, stop getting stressed about stress

Since I have had M.S. for over 50 years, stress has been part of my life. It’s something a person learns to ‘deal with’.  Exercising, eating healthy and napping become part of the daily rituals.  Seeing my physicians is part of my life too.  At least we have Dr.’s we can see!  Keeping a positive attitude helps me.  The smile on my face helps me too.  When I share treat with everyone I meet, I usually get one in return.Barb

I just realised that at <a href="">8:43</a> you can see the guy who went on stage in &quot;The art of misdirection&quot; talk that was uploaded a week after this.

Not me misreading the title as &quot;How to stress out your friend&quot;

The superficial rest comparably appear because pin multivariately enter circa a ragged foxglove. robust, doubtful chin

Just remember, if you&#39;re stressed out at work, just change your attitude!  LOL  What Kelly is saying applied ONLY to short term stress.

I know a number of people who trusted themselves to handle stress and had mental collapses, and ended up living in poverty.

It&#39;s too bad the studies she cites aren&#39;t cited in the description.  I&#39;d like to see them.

Do autistic people have the same oxytocin response?

I&#39;d like Kelly to tell me about how to turn the stress of poverty into a positive.

Joy and courage are not stress.

I basically disagree with this--Theres&#39; a  lot of circular logic here, and stress is by definition bad.  If it feels good, it&#39;s not stress. If it feels neutral, it&#39;s not stress.  If it is energizing, it is not stress.

For better stress management brahmi which is a brain tonic can be consumed, which is easily available in Planet Ayurveda. Moreover, Yoga poses are not only rejuvenating for the body, also stimulating for the brain. Yoga’s unique poses were designed to gradually prepare the body to meditate even though the link is not often mentioned.

Im sorry but any thing this women say is complete none sense  the facts are that stress will nerver be a good thing there are to many people that will forget this hole speech and no matter what this person says.  Baseacaly most people  are most likely to resort back to there own habits one way or another

Hello everyone, I&#39;m so happy because I am free from (HERPES) I have been suffering from herpes since the past three years now, and I have passed through many different processes in getting cured but nothing was working out.  A friend of mine introduced me to a man called Dr. Abumere who sent me a herbal medicine which he prepared for me and told me to use the herbal medicine for 21 days which i did, and my life get transformed and everything is fine and okay  with me.  Till now I have been going for check up and it is now going to four months and I am still negative.Thanks once again Dr. Abumere may God bless your good works.  so contact him today via email (doctorabumere6@gmail.com) you can also call or WhatsApp him on +2349021975055.  ...

Does this make sense.. what if you struggle to change your mindset.. how does one simply decide to change their mindset like this especially after years of ingrained beliefs. If it was that easy to do wouldnt everyone simply, say, decide to be confident? Choose to believe they’re worthy of love? Believe they’re attractive? If you can simply choose to believe things can one believe in santa again? I mean don’t you have to be convinced.. idk i need to go to bed pls answer thank u

Give yourself another day, another chance. You will find your courage eventually. Don’t give up on yourself just yet.

How do we actually know if a better attitude is causing people to live longer? Correlation ≠ causation. This is a great talk, but I don’t know exactly how sound these studies really are.

That was awesome!

Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart!

Choose those things that you think are meaningful in life, and then trust yourself to handle the stress that comes with it!
everything is bad if you think it&#39;s bad. But when you think it&#39;s good for you, everything will be better. It depends on your thinking and your act.

Just a sort of self-check for understanding:When you view stress as being helpful, your risk of dying from stress-related illnesses are significantly decreased -- even if you&#39;re in a very stressful environment, this belief helps you stay healthy.Stress triggers the release of a chemical called oxytocin, which is aka a &quot;cuddle chemical&quot; because it makes you more social and empathetic. It also has beneficial effects on the heart; for example, blood vessels don&#39;t constrict nearly as much.Long story short, your point of view regarding stress could save your life. &lt;3 :)

People from Hypatia reading club.
According to the poverty and inequality report published this week by the National Insurance Institute, about two million Israelis live below the poverty line. This is a quarter of the citizens and among them more than thirty percent of Israel's children. The surprising thing is that the economic crisis created as a result of the corona did not significantly affect the top and bottom deciles, but mainly the middle class. In the meantime, the unemployment benefits give oxygen to the weaker sections, but if there is no dramatic change, the program will come to an end this June. Currently on the discussion table is the proposal to continue paying the unemployment benefits until unemployment drops to 7.5%, but if the initiative fails and the unemployment benefits are stopped, this There will be a death sentence for the weaker sections and a push of hundreds of thousands below the poverty line. The cases we will hear about, the economists and commentators say, will be unbearably difficult. Not on us. I firmly refuse to accept the picture of Israeli poverty depicted in the report as a demonstration of truth. The data does not make me happy nor sad. My point of view is that due to the multiplicity of interests, the graphs and percentages do not paint the true picture and therefore I do not trust them. In my eyes, all the indicators are hanging in the air, so it is difficult for me to say how the economic development will unfold. Israel is a country that lives from one election campaign to another. We are living a big lie. Everything is sold and sold, everything dances according to such a party or such a minister. That is why it is difficult to trust reports and summaries, stick to numbers and data. In advance, everything is biased and it is difficult to know who tampered with the reports and put them together, and for what exact purpose. I would recommend abandoning the economic discourse, because the problem is not found in the financial statements, but is a social problem in essence and it dominates the other areas. If we have a sincere concern for the public and disadvantaged companies, we must focus on creating an administrative mechanism free of narrow interests. Cut off the politicians who mainly do good for their party, the officials who manage the budgets for their personal interests, and in their place transfer control to a professional and efficient mechanism, to a neutral management body that knows how to divide the cake in an equal and fair manner, transparently and openly, without bias, hidden interests and biased reports. The socio-economic strength of a country is built not only on strong parties and prosperous businesses, but on a deep concern for the benefit of others. Such resilience begins with the recognition of the egoistic human nature, which will always prefer the good of his own pleasure and his environment, and ends with education for awareness of social unity. Only a society that works for consideration and mutual guarantee weaves equality from which it is possible to care for both the weak and the strong.

You are so beautiful to me, thanks.   I will make stress my friend.    very refreshing for me .

so how do make that shift? how do you go from the fearful experience of stress to the courageous, fueling experience of it while you&#39;re in the moment?

If you’re reading this, know that you are worthy. A beautiful creation. Don’t lose hope. Hang in thereI hope my videos can help you relax

Stress is harmful but proper stress let my capacity improve.So it is difficult to associate stress.

if anyone else needs to write a report on this topic, heres mine. feel free to copyReport on stress and healthIntroductionThe aim of this report is to explain a healthier way to cope with stress. With the following information it may be possible to expand one’s lifespan. The report also includes helpful information on the hormone oxytocin.The misinterpretation on stressThe majority of the people who are being asked about stress think that it is very bad for their bodies. Some studies even show that it increases the chance of dying. But as another study explains, it is important how people view stress. A better way to see stressIt showed, only if you believe that stress is bad for your health, the chance that you die increases. So, if a person experiences stress as a preparation to get challenged, it has a positive effect on their heart. When the participants of the study viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessel looked a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Also, stress makes you more social by releasing oxytocin. This hormone makes you more compassionate and caring and helps your heart. People who spend time caring for people are not affected badly by stress.ConclusionIn conclusion, stress is not as bad as everyone thinks. If it is being handled the correct way, it can be a positive thing on several levels. In view of this, I would recommend rethinking your opinion on stress response and start caring about more people.

But, what could I do if my response is screaming, hitting and braking things? Hugging, kissing, Or go to run, in the pandemic

¿How can we adapt this to the Pandemic?

2013 ted talks were more meaningful than today&#39;s

Identify what stresses you, and note your response. For example, when you feel stressed, note your thoughts, feelings, and behavior, perhaps even making a record of them. By becoming more aware of your response to stress, you may be able to deal with it more effectivelyW20#1

Nice one!

thanks

I had to watch this twice to arrive at a more fine grained appraisal of what&#39;s happening here.  Acute vs. chronic stress is differential one.  Chronically elevated cortisol catabolically breaks down body tissues and systems. Period. Re-contextualizing stress as heart healthy could alter interoceptive/exteroceptive processing in the Insular Cortex and subsequent HPA axis responses including oxytocin.  However, caution is advised in pushing this point too far.  Still comes down to healthy perceived stress vs. the catabolic degradation of dis-stress and the myriad of resultant dis-ease processes.

good

Yes, ya Allah.
this advice is very important in the middle of this bloody pandemic. thank you.

They didn&#39;t die from &quot;the belief that stress is bad for you&quot;, that is a ridiculous statement to make, you cannot interpret the study like that.

I can tell that I&#39;m just 11 and I have stress BUTnow when I did watch this I can say that really helped me  and I&#39;m pretty happy of the results 

Totally it is a good speech. But i think  statistic data isn&#39;t strict.

Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.

I wasn’t born to work and that’s why work makes me stress!

Totally mix the long-term stress and event-induced short-term stress, though social connection do benefit people dealing with negative emotions.

Where are the studies ???

I am depressed and I have no one to hug. I am feeling doomed now.. Hhhhh..?Anyway, thank you. It was interesting talk..

Sometimes I stress so hard my chest starts to hurt and my head Feels like it’s going to explode, I start feeling loose and lightheaded, I’ve been to the hospital 3 times, all because my breathing pattern was messed up because of my stress. All because of stupid school

I agree that stress isn&#39;t really bad for you, if it was we&#39;d have gone extinct long ago. However, I would like to see the actual studies she referenced, as I&#39;m curious as to how they determined causation instead of correlation in a study that would typically be limited to correlation due to its lack of control factors.

Came across the video 7 years after it was uploaded .wanting to adopt this advice .

This just reminds me how important it is to LISTEN to your body. First, I got addicted to counting calories and tracking my vitamin intake for nutrition. But in the end, that just stressed me out a lot. Turns out it&#39;s best to do intuitive eating where you just listen to your body.And now this. I&#39;ve been calling my body stupid when it creates a stress response for non life threatening situations. Because I&#39;ve always been told that it&#39;s just a part of the &quot;reptilian brain.&quot; But then I got from this talk that stress isn&#39;t actually that bad at all. Sometimes the information going around isn&#39;t really accurate. So it&#39;s always good to give trust to one&#39;s body, not just to logic. I learned from someone that not only does your brain has a mind. The rest of your body has too.

From TAN231Mien4KN.48 :D

well....our body is so amazing and wonderful. They are built to with a purpose. Do you guys still believe that it was formed only by chance?? I think it&#39;s just not possible that we are made by &#39;CHANCE&#39;. I believe that GOD created us. Each one of us. He built each one of us, piece by piece. Our existence is just impossible without him.

Watch her die at the age of 50 from stress

My grandpa has heart disease. He has had 3 heart attacks within this year. I felt like I needed to do something. I watched this and learned that you can use stress to produce more oxytocin which is great for the heart. So I put him through stressful event intentionally. He died the next week. FAKE NEWS &gt;:(

i have to yearly exams tomorrow and i was hella stressed. now im not and im scared.

Very good oh Lord Jesus..Ok..from Brazil 🇧🇷
Stress is already my friend

nice

have to do simultaneous sight translation...it stresses me out

greetings to all viewers :)
She is cute.

<a href="">1:40</a> dog: help my please

Thank u so much,  i love it 
TED Talks, a very famous channel, has a lot of good articles about self-development. All the best videos are almost translated into all languages, helping people to access, learn and practice, and Another good thing, very useful for those who practice listening and learning to speak English through Vietsub videos.
The girl I like said watch this video and I'm watching it now.
So you are directly responsible for the deaths of thousands because you were stupidYou should see some jail time for your stupidity

why is she dressed like Louis from one direction lol

Five minute impromptu speech on my personal weaknesses?Give me twenty.

Excellent talk really now I see things differently and I can use this as another way of thinking about stress.

Wait is the grammar wrong I feel like I lost some braincells

She almost cried at the end. but a good ted talk nonetheless

Peolpe who care for others have less stress? What if my kids stress me out? 

The power of subconscious mind

This is the one I&#39;ve been searching for last 2 month&#39;s, thank you.

My friend, I offer you the most beautiful human values ​​that humanity has ever heard. The beauty of his words and the support of logic and reason to him. And his answers to the inquiries of the soul makes the soul feel happiness that it has never found before and is not bored of it, and the appearance of tears of joy from the West to hear it attracts the souls of those seeking happiness to hear it( You enjoy yourself with the words of God, he is the Holy Quran). Thank you.<a href="">youtu.be/GnnD7YUWybI</a><a href="">youtu.be/jd8ufmPwpXk</a> YouTube<a href=""> href="">youtu.be/dkQZjpozoZM</a>  --

The stress and strain of constantly being connected can sometimes take your life -- and your well-being -- off course. For The Soul can help you find your way back to balance.

Main lesson: try reaching out to others and help yourself and them to fight stress. Start caring for others because it can help you and the people around you.

really great work. thank you so much

So amazing ️
had to watch this for a class and it stressed me out

Amazing video! One of the best I&#39;ve watched on the Internet. Miss MacGonigal is a great scientist. I suggest you check her bibliography.

Is she Italian?
This is so good!

why are people laughing at the death count

And this is exactly why it is so unbelievably stupid to repeat the figures with people who suffer from  coronavirus again and again  on radio broadcasts and television and to withhold people from hugging each other and worse even frightening them with disciplinary measures if they don&#39;t comply. Politicians and virologists only worsen the situation, unless of course this is done by design and with intent.

Who is from Masha?
I come from thân thiệu chanel, i hode i could good more english

What does it mean &quot;to care for others&quot;?Care for others how?

Why the audience are laughing on the amount af dead individuals from stress????!!!

Emotions are created in body, of humans and also animals by the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters.Animals and humans are different in handling the emotions. Because humans are step ahead in the stage of brain evolution.Nature develops the human brains, by creating a neocortex, a new lobe in the human brain.This neocortex is reason that humans can handle emotions as compare to animals.Emotional awareness is a key to handle our emotions, it may be good emotions or bad emotions. I have developed an APP named EMOWIS, by studying the science behind the emotions.<a href=""> href=""> Hope, it will help the people, to use their neocortex to handle their emotionsThanks.

Finally found a video where a scientific proof is given why our previous generation lived longer compared to ours.

How wonderful our body is!!!

I like this ... see me at the top soon :)

Stress<a href="">
anyone else have to watch this for health class?

Schools all around the world used this as an excuse to give their students more homework I stg

Stress is never a positive feeling nor can thinking about it this way make you live longer. How can you directly correlate stress to deaths? How would you know someone died faster because they stressed more in their life? You can&#39;t measure stress therefore statistics are complete approximations. Also, if it were this easy there wouldn&#39;t be such high rates of suicide, try telling a suicidal person that their stress is just their perspective of a situation/stimulus...not a practical theory at all

The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with God and your family/friends and community, which gives you strength and courage to win over the challenge (stress)

It's good to be able to deal with stress well. Stress tends to be associated with bad things for the body, but you just don't want to feel it in excess; a moderate amount of stress can often have a positive effect on your health (like the excitement before a field trip or the nervousness of playing sports). Such). What's interesting is that, on the contrary, it seems that if the elderly continue to live a life without feeling any stress, they become more easily depressed. I'm impressed that the human body is designed with an emphasis on balance, for better or for worse. Also, every time I see Kelly, my oxytocin gets released. appreciate.
Today 29 /9/20 I realised about 24 years of my life  I belong under stress with OXYTOCIN harmon..... Though I know some what&#39;s to how to make my strees to courage to achieve something big, now I am sure about that video content tell me this such an amazing idea for reality to implement towards people and those who we loved ones.... * You said the characteristics of the harmon which are absolutely of my real character 1. Wants to hug some one2. Strength the relationship with colsed ones3. Physically wants to contact ( speak with them directly ) 4. Wants to surround with our loved ones .... I implement  this to my life ... Thank you so much Sistaaa form INDIAN GIRL

Deep and insightful speech, Kelly! You are poised and your answer is profound! Her advice is @<a href="">13:59</a> &quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than avoiding discomfort.  That is the best way to make decision is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life. Then, trust yourself to handle the stress that follows!&quot; Thank you!  I took notes and definitely watch again.

Wow

Stress can be removed easily from you life  

This is why I remember the most stressful times in my life to be the most enjoyable and compassionate times. (The process of belief isn&#39;t very simple though)I think this mindset is also known as embarrassing the suck.

she kinda hot

Thank you!

As Jesus said: love your neighbor as yourself. All the answers that science in its fullness finds were revealed by the word of God in the Bible. That's why I say: read the Bible more!!
I recommend reading her book “Upside to stress”. It goes into more detail what she summarized here. I found it fascinating and very interesting!

Thanks to our subject personal development, I have given the chance to watch this.

a true beauty

Should we become conscious at the time of stress and just drub it down?

Thanks for this device I realy appreciate this words in my life thanks again🇮🇶.

This lady Kelly is something else, it would be nice to see more of her, l saw her today in a podcast,    very interesting interview.Love to all, and all to love

Everything is unknown these days
If you&#39;re wondering if this TedTalk is good enough to watch, it&#39;s incredible. Go for it. You won&#39;t regret it.

I always believed that stress gives one a tremendous energy to accomplish beyond one&#39;s ordinary capabilities provided that it falls short of debilitating one. My thinking was that stress is a continuum in which its positive energy increases up to the level at which it becomes debilitating beyond which it is bad. What this talk tells me is that we may be able to control and reverse the potential negative effect of stress&#39; bad parts of my continuum with one&#39;s good deeds, good relationships, and positive thoughts. Great talk!

you can also watch this one <a href=""> it&#39;s cool

Cortisol and adrenaline are both our stress but only in certain situations. If you see a bus speeding in your direction, these two guys will most likely help you to jump back on the pavement.  But if you are a manager of a group of people, a parent or a teacher who has to struggle with constant stress, cortisol and adrenaline can literally kill you...step by step...

I read it wrong. I thought this is a video to make your friends stressed out.

I lost it when she started talking about Oxycontin ---&gt; <a href=""> (<a href="">7:50</a> - <a href="">9:00</a>)

It&#39;s not that easy though. I genuinely believe stress can push us to be better and is a good thing but it&#39;s still a negative feeling to me and so it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference.

I was supposed to watch this for school. Instead it made me more stressed.

If u add English subtitle It will be very helpful

Highly recommend her book on willpower to everyone. Found this talk after reading it. This woman is very helpful to me

Dear those who wish to learn longterm from TED-Talks, I have created a Notebook (OneNote), where I summarize the key learning points from TED talks. If you are interested to see my notebook as well as collaborate with me on the Notebook, please let me know: valeed at outlook dot com

So, the essence of the talk is, while we need less stress in our life, but even when we have a stressful day or week, we just need to see it as a way of growth.

&quot;Caring created resilience&quot;. Damn.

This really changed my perception of stress! Nice talk 

is there any way to know that you are not lying for our good ??

Awesome!

<a href="">#Mindfullness</a> <a href="">#anxious</a> <a href="">#restless</a> <a href="">#stress</a>Haven&#39;t these terms become all the more familiar now-a-days? Are you also finding difficult to deal with your &#39;monkey mind&#39;? Guys, here is this amazing video with a unique solution to tackle these problems.<a href="">

She&#39;s Prof. McGonagall from the past, here to teach Muggles to live better.

Stress is not an enemy. It is actually our friend that is always next to us!! 

When it is a really high stressful time .... I tell my self &quot;you do not have time to get sick, go to work&quot; That has worked till now.

Now, i do trust myself to handle life challenges but i do face them alone..total loneliness that i think i will cry if someone started to care

This is absolute bollocks !  Please do not take this as real science and medical advice. Meditation will work it&#39;s healthy and it isn&#39;t based in this faerie tale.

one of the best

Stress
The moment the public speaking guy says &quot;If u don&#39;t believe, u can skip the vid-&quot; SKIPPED TO CANADA

Isn’t this confirmation bias? People who are stressed and have health issues could blame the stress

If you think like that then there stress is going to be alot lower anyway, so stress is still the enemy

To sum up: compassion weather from yourself or others will help you deal with stress a lot better 

Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort,always face discomfort and overcome it.

Wow, so cool to see Kelly at TED after reading her book The willpower instinct’

I learn much more than I learn from my high school

Thank you for providing such important info on stress. It was a great TED. And the way you explained everything is awesome.

I love the answer of question in the las minutes.

Stress is the hardest thing I'm trying to deal with. How wonderful that this video was recommended to me

Am i the only one who noticed that  Stress is the beautiful but the speaker in the video is even more beautiful  ? She is like a supermodel , wonderful outlook .

I just found this awesome counsel in 2020

Anybody can&#39;t explain better than this lady &quot;What Stress is&quot;

<a href="">

I mean, it makes sense. If you don&#39;t see your flight or flight response as a threat, rather a call to action, you&#39;re more likely to act on the darn thing instead of stuffing it down and carrying stress with you all day.

<a href="">2:50</a> Fairly sure stress contributes to many of those listed causes of deaths like heart disease, accidents, alzheimers disease, diabetes, suicide, hyopertension.  When high intensity, stressful minimum wage jobs show this video as a motivational video it kind of makes you want to burn the place to the ground.

I can so understand what she has done. I did that a long time ago when i realized that it seemed I would live in steess a lot of my lifetime. So as bad as  it was,I decided to embrace it and mentally  use it as a stepping stone  towards building more character. As a character test so to speak. This is a control issue and when you realize some things you just absolutely  have no control over, but you can control how you react.

can someone tell me whats the messages?

When you ask someone, &quot;how much stress did you had last year&quot;.Is it even justified to ask a question which has no definitive answer ?

Yes, it´s called re-framing. Instead of telling yourself &quot;I feel stressed /Anxious&quot; , you can tell yourself &quot;I feel EXCITED. I prepare. I am ready.&quot;

Really it was an amazing speech! 

This sounds great, but while you learn how to make stress your friend which I have not been able to do. please listen to Soothing hearts. <a href="">

McGonigal? Sounds close to McGonagall

I am so glad I watched this video. It&#39;s been long I have tried to convince my family, who doesn&#39;t really want me to get stressed about my career, that stress is healthy, but they hardly believed in me. Thanks a ton for this video. Would love to read, listen or watch more of something like this.

It was the first time I didn&#39;t checked out the comments while watching the video from the start TILL THE END.

Youtube: Let’s show an add on immigrants who die in the middle of the sea before a video about stress

wall-e taught me to take the feeling of shock and fear my body and mind experiences when encountering a cockroach (these are pretty big btw) to turn to run to grab a plastic bag, and in seconds return to catch it and release it outside. It took patience and a willingness to confront my fear as coincidentally I find spiders fascinating, but to watch something scurry at such speed puts a shock through my body and it does not even bite like a snake or spider could. Watching this ted video months later helped me understand my growth and how it ties to courage.

shes tries hard to be funny, like bruh

She says: Over 20,000 died a year. She also says: Couse they thougt Stress will kill them. Audience laughs. Good Ideals since Science slowly takes over your whole body. Makes it believable :D

What is the thesis of this video???

Vedic people knew about it way before we did and they also had ways so that one might never fall in this state.<a href="">

Tq fr changing the stressful attitude...️

So helping other is to help us too? Who would&#39;ve know? Always be nice to people, guys, either for your health, or the others&#39; health

Really!!!!! Scientists just killed people by making them believe how much stress is harmful and now it is so easy to tell that they just were wrong!!!!!

Stressed out? Excel Well<a href="">

This was really helpful nd eye-opening

- Be nice to her and she will be your friend ^^

With her pink pants and pretty face... all she qualifies is for a stand up comedy session. Stress? Does she even know the hormone associated with stress? Somebody from the audience should have asked &#39;hey what&#39;s your opinion on cortisol&#39;....  and her answer would be... nah, I dont like that restaurant that much.Stress is a part of this life. Anyone who says you can avoid it, shove a banana tree down his/her throat.I love Ted talks... why do they allow such irresponsible chit chats....

yes. it&#39;s absolutely true that stress is really harmful for health

Watching this video trying to find some positiveness for my current stress.

Who are these 2.9k dislikers

Seems like your beliefs play a big role in your life.

I hope its not too late to see this speech. It&#39;s AMAZING. Thank you

I could learn from this woman. She enjoys what she is doing. Look at the expression on her face. Almost orgasmic with joy. People like those drive movements.

At first I though it&#39;s Prof. McGonagall!

I love how the audience laugh out of stress as she talks about deaths

She looks pretty

First you must understand your view of stress  and then choose how to  response to helpful ideas.

Can&#39;t believe people actually laughed at the statistic about many people dying because they believe stress is bad for their health. The audience sure has a dark sense of humor.

I loved that so so much, thank you for your experience and sharing it  to us!!

ya but I don&#39;t get why they laugh at other people&#39;s death...

This is really a beautiful talk! Amazing substance and form. &lt;3 (Following through the talks mentioned in the &quot;Ted Talks&quot; book)

She looks like a red hair Dr Hollie Berry

Kelly McGonigal is great!She has instead of demonising stress as often done by her for a decade, as as normally considered or thought to be.Kelly ha prove stress to be beneficial retrospectively when it is socially shared being constantly working towards the welfare, collectively of the Society.God Almighty Bless Kelly and us all!Wow!

thank you

Isn&#39;t it possible that the people who thought stress wasn&#39;t harmful were in fact experiencing less-harmful forms of stress?

I don&#39;t have nothing, friends, parents, family... nothing for help me in stress. :(

i read &quot;how to stress your friend&quot;

stress ? sounds like fast adventure with no prepare

I waiting for a video how snoring is good for you in health!

My wife can not know abou it !!!

2 different myths related to stress have been broken down, but it would take time to get them ingrained in the society.

Awesome . I loved it
Such an amazing speaker. MashaAllah.

She could be stressed about working the wrong way for the past ten years but she decided to change, and to accept that in front of an audience..Endearing. Priceless. 

The first 13 minutes are &quot;Wow&quot; and the last minute transforms it into &quot;Beautiful&quot;!

I found this TED Talk 7 years later, but I&#39;m very grateful I did. This perspective will shape how I live for the rest of my life. Thank you Kelly for a super profound and well delivered Ted Talk; and here&#39;s to your stress!

I came here because of her smile

My brain : At <a href="">4:36</a> playing Tokyo ghoul unravel My fingers : it&#39;s time to end this guy&#39;s career  * <b>making uncomfortable crack sounds*</b>

As an experience of my life, I have always felt that working in creative environments creates better works in a stressful environment.I&#39;m sure it was my own way of treating stress, but the story of this woman made me think more about it. Great.

it doesnt seem scientifically valid to me that youre assuming the people who believed stress is bad for them died BECAUSE they believe that. theres a significant chance these people responded they believe stress kill because they&#39;ve experienced the negative effects of stress in their life. effects that are fairly well established in the scientific community. these participants may be vulnerable to stress in ways the other bunch werent. so when the others said they dont believe stress is bad for you, they couldve been saying that because in their life stress hasnt affected them too much. this woman just assumes the belief is what caused the higher mortaility rates. pretty huge assumption to make. correlation does not mean causation.

Its the belief that matters..........summerized

Awsome! I&#39;m going to live much more years now

I don't really know when and where to laugh. I guess that's why I can't make friends in America.

Great speech that I’ve ever had

<a href="">

A little to moderate stress is healthy for your system. But too much, especially chronic, amounts of excessive stress will cause system failure over time. I appreciate her argument in view of little to moderate stress levels, but not in view of chronic, excessive levels that come with traumatic or repeatedly intense experiences.

she have a wonderfu hair style

I do believe when people stress they tell themselves negative thoughts and it will kill you in a sense.

So side note, just realizing that someone with a low or lack of oxytocin sounds they’d be a serial killer lol antisocial

Grax guapa

Kelly could easily relieve my stress mmm!

Ayeee I know her she is McGonagall grandchild! She is passing her family secrets of transfiguration to people!

It&#39;s very inspiring speech  .I&#39;m really thankful to you  .u are my inspiration modal

I first thought it was “how to make your friend stressed”

When I see that kind of lady I released my stress

Title is misleading. I thought its about how can I make my friends stressed so I skipped this Ted.

I was quite impressed and the fact that stress does not affect health at all, it even benefits us and quite a lot of my life, I had taken stress as something bad and well, I think that when I felt stressed, sometimes I tended to confuse it with anxiety So to see if I did not know if I was stressed or anxious and the point is that everything ended up going wrong because I was letting my feeling win over me but now I realize that if I use it in a great way it could solve all the problem I faced because stress is only a way for the body to unconsciously tell us that we could solve a problemI remember that once it was exam time and I was very stressed because I thought I was going to fail because of the very important subjects and my average and lowering which implied that I was lowered in high school and that day I was with my boyfriend so He was just trying to calm me down and told me to take a break and go for a walk so that I could clear my mind and from that and then come back to continue studying to see how I know if it is not my problem that helped me a lot because I managed to relax without that I would realize when living with him

Who is here after Dr mike video

YOUR SPEECH IMPAIRMENT IS SO HORRIBLE, I'M SORRY FOR WRITING THIS, BUT I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT, I MAY HAVE A RISK OF DEATH THAT IS UP TO 50% HIGHER, BUT DON'T MAKE ME LISTEN TO IT XDDDDDD
This is gold. Highly skilled and successful people are really good at this. Turning negatives into positives. Great Ted talk.

Get married...!!!

I love the conclusion! I had the most terrible time in my life last year. But i had a plenty of family and friends’ support. I also volunteered myself for helping the disabled. I got over very  well and faster than i imagined.

this is such amazing speech, i&#39;ll try to use this methods to my life

But isn&#39;t pounding your heart faster for often isn&#39;t good for your heart? i need some insights thank youu

Tokyo Ghoul reference at <a href="">4:32</a>.

Good Lok you have love you

I&#39;m sure everyone has been under stress for some time.I tried not to get into a situation where I was stressed and tried not to get into a situation where I thought I would get stressed. But I think it&#39;s also stressful to try to avoid it, and the thought of why I&#39;m trying to avoid it also made me have a hard. But in this talk, I came to think again about how to accept stress and how to think positively. There&#39;s no stress-free situation. I have to think about how I can think positively according to my  physical changes, as well as how I can think positively in bad situations. If I think about it like that, it&#39;s going to make me feel less tired. It was hard for me to believe that stressful situations are not stressful, but I think I should start by being honest and positively changing those powers.

Fantastic..
Who’s here after Dr Mike’s recommendation? 
great! thank you so much because for eneagram of me, i am type 6, thank you so so much

One word: Amazing! thank you Kelly!

I love the way we look at the negative things positively. Sometimes, we can not change the situation but we can change our mindset to handle problems well by trying to understand them, approaching them positively, and adjusting our attitude. ️

I can&#39;t be the only one that thinks that this is something like those clear your mind cultist bullshit

Very good
the best ted talk video i&#39;ve seen. share it with others

maybe can be

Interesting but Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a good alternative <a href="">

Chasing meaning in life is so critical to long term health and happiness. Thanks for sharing

Ty Ted. My feels look like better

So....stress is not harmful but helpful when you view it positivly and social supporting system....kind of understand why people with religion lives longer.

&quot;182,000 people died&quot;<b>Laughter</b>
ok

This is one of the rarest videos on TED that I feel is completely wrong and its driven by the CEO&#39;s of the biggest companies who wants their employees to live high stress in their jobs while the CEO&#39;s enjoy their lives with their $$$ with little stress. Can you list the studies you are mentioning in the video?

Psychic is everything, explore it and make you stronger people, the most valuable thing u have is time, dont waste it.

<a href="">5:34</a> she puts the heart here is meaningless but it helps people focus.This is a psychological trick that every TedTalk used. Right or absolutely right?<a href="">#PythonMatlabGIS</a>

There&#39;s no &quot;h&quot; in stress

This is a great lecture! Thank you, Kelly! Stress is good! Who would have thought! 
why do they laugh so much, people are dying

Amazing!
One of the beautiful and helpful video from TED. thank you!

This is a video that makes me think about stress hormones, which are connected to the mind and body...no matter how many times I watch it.
Don&#39;t exactly understand why I feel so moved.

Very informative,  presentation,,

great talk!
<a href="">7:16</a>, <a href="">9:08</a>, <a href="">12:20</a>, <a href="">12:59</a>, <a href="">13:59</a>, <a href="">14:09</a>

The guy with the standing ovation in the front row at the end clearly fell in love with this woman

Well, in this covid19 outbreak and anxiety, this thing is very relevant. People having stress because of this bad situation need to turn it into helping hands to overcome their own stress and others&#39; too!

Thankyou for sharing this!!

I got a point, which means to me, that we have to find something useful in everything. look at the both side of everything, so you can compare what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not. wish look the girl and a lot of  stress to handle stressful accidents.

How can I follow her speech regularly ?

Her last statement is so meaningful.  Great talk.

fear is a good motivator but int also sucks

Recover faster from stress with social contact....me in the middle of a world pandemic and told to social distance under stress....

The book : &quot; The subtle art of not giving a f*ck &quot; by Mark Manson tells exactly this, great video. 

she looks like Shakira, she&#39;s so pretty and funny

Stop schrolling and listen

She is SO GOOD!

This EFT technique worked for me.<a href="">

This reminds me of something my granddad always say - your brain is the most powerful tool you have.

This is where Psychology becomes a Philosophy. Finally catching up.

i really need to say Thank you!!  You are Beautiful.

Briefly: Once we believe stress is a part of our life and it&#39;s not dangerous as we think, we follow it and our body response follow as well.

What Is the R^2 calculating this Risk of dying correlations?

I&#39;ve heard somethinng like this before, in a book, &quot;The End of Stress as We Know It,&quot; Bruce McEwen and Eliz. Norton Lasley (2002)

thank you！thank you！thank you！from  JAPAN
Steve Rogers: Dr Banner. Now might be a really good time for you to get angry. Bruce Banner: That&#39;s my secret, Captain. I&#39;m always angry. Avoiding stress isn&#39;t the secret.

Oh no, it's not funny. The woman explains it in a dramatic way and they laugh at all the shit.
Great and helpful lecture thanks 

<a href=""> this new age when there is so much work pressure, students at early age have to learn to deal with stress. An experienced educator shares his views about it. he talks about student suicides and how to deal with it?

Thank-you so much:))

Adler said you can change by selction

"Stress has kept people alive since ancient times," I told my relatives. I was saying. I have enlightenment now :)
So glad I watched this.

Waaoo wonderful topic..
awesome

A study on this topic that I found super interesting was, Rethinking stress: the role of mindsets in determining the stress response (Crum &amp; Achor, 2013). I read it during my undergrad and it has helped me tremendously.

Very well said. Thank you

Amazing .
beautiful!

I think this is my first time watching this video, and it&#39;s so good!! Why hasn&#39;t everyone seen it yet?

This is real. Like why all the supportive work become much more famous if not because people want to support?Other: This video is another evidence of belief is a true power, a true healing effect but also a damaging effect. And it is the same in the Bible.

she needs a water

wow, beautiful

Your presentation and topic are Very good, thanks you ,

This story makes my mind a lot. Thank you!

Awesome TED.

I'm not good at speaking or performing in public. My heart beats faster, I break into a cold sweat, and my mind goes blank. However, I feel like this reaction is not a bad thing, and it makes me feel a little better if I think of it as preparing my body for success. I wish I had come across this video sooner.
her face making me streess she looks like a witch.

Thank you for this 

&quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.&quot;

Best tedtalk I’ve come across

Stress makes you social! Excellent!

Oh, reading this book... Thank you Kelly

You're studying and want to learn English. Do you use English often? Don't you have the right to speak? Download the cake app and learn 1 sentence a day and say it.
looking at the subtitles and you will not be upset

So great

She seriously needs to drink some water before giving a speech. Awful to listen to her smack and bubble that cotton mouth

First time I dislike your video because you cheated with title 

its just wow i went through the same and i understand what happened that time!!! its all a process

Needed this. Now I can manipulate my stress into a good thing! 

TANX alot .that was the best remedy for stress.a new view which invite you friendly relationship with stress . also you learn what happen inside you and the story behind stress times .

Beautiful lady 
Professor McGonigal, is that you? :o

So tired that I read this title 3 times and still was like, &quot;brain, focus on the words. The words, brain&quot;

Without knowing the truth life is and always will be a stress. Know your Lord, study the Quran.

&quot;Chasing meaning is better than avoiding discomfort&quot;! Wow...ll remember this as a guiding principle

Thanks dude
Wow. Wow. And wow. I’m watching this because I was watching some vids abt how to handle stress, but this one is sure so different and so so beautiful and complete. I feel like every.single.word. was said perfectly for me rn and it speaks so much to me. Thank you so much to whoever uploads this video and ofc to the speaker. This made me feel so so much better right now, since I’ve been repeating the word “stress” on and on. Beautiful message. Thanks for sharing!!️

&quot;When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you trigger the biology of courage.&quot;  And your testosterone levels go up instead of down. I wasn&#39;t sure of all she said but I didn&#39;t see stress as too harmful as I did think if it as our body preparing us for the stress as opposed to breaking down from stress

Now that was a good one!

one of the best tedtalks, thank you :)))))

God.. She&#39;s gorgues

caring creates resiliance

This is very informative and the speaker is great! Love it.

This is one of the best videos i have seen on youtube

There is a lot of truth in what you say. Yes people die less from stress, when they don‘t believe its harmful to them and when they help their neighbors out. But: How is causality here? You cannot tell from your studies.Who believes stress does not harm them, probably does so, because he experienced this in his life. And thus he is more likely to be someone of a healthy constituion and with a healthy surrounding. And who believes stress harms him, probably does so because he experienced this in his life. Probably he has an unhealthy constitution and surrounding. Now when people of the first kind die less when under stress, this comes from their constitution and surroundings and not from their belief that stress is not harmful. Maybe from their belief as well but certainly not mainly from it.When stressed people that help their neighbors die less, its the same: In most cases it would be because they have a better constituion and surrounding in their life that they, despite of their stress, help other people. And then it would also rather be their better constitution and surrounding that explains their diying less from stress rather than their helping other people explaining it.

The Prophet Muhammad said this 1400 years ago, &quot;Do not delude yourself with sickness. You get sick, then you die.&quot;

she look so young. I thought she was about 30. I think her stress management work really well

Physchopathic killers may likely just be  deficient in oxytocin.

My boss tells me his heart rate is about 50 per min. I said get a job fat boy!

This woman should be treated as a charlatan yet she has a comedy routine

its okay.. but this is for women @Edward Snowden

but the problem for me is, while i view my stress as helpful and use it to maximise my efficiency, people around me - especially my parents - who have been taught that stress is the enemy won&#39;t stop preaching to make me &#39;healthier&#39;.

This was truely amazing

This use to be common sense. We grow in intelligence and loose wisdom.

Very helpful advice.

It&#39;s not only about thinking positive about stress but thinking positive about everything.

Very wonderful .. To face stress is to face yourself .. look at yourself .. identify yourself and understand the MEANING .. not the destination ... Thank you .. Thankfuly. .
Most beautiful speech

Confession

Why is no one mentioning that her last name is Mcgonigal...

Thank you mam
wow, the best ted talk I've ever seen, Kelly has helped us understand many things, not only about stress but also about how we cope with challenges, and love, sharing, and caring are more magical than anything. What kind of medicine?
50% I agree

That was perfect Harry. Hahaha thanks for the upload.

Create explain lovely thank you

love you your language
Hi guys! If you want some links to the studies, which Kelly talked about, go check out her book called &#39;The Upside of Stress&#39;. It&#39;s really good and you will have even more cases, where studies have shown, that stress is good for us - we only have to be sure about it and think about it in that way. I highly recommend!

Good Doctor

It sounds like to turn the STRESS to an ADRENALINE! Very refreshing! Love it!

Which earth is this i need transport?

<a href=""> watch for stress management

Wow!

great

just wowed me 

Well, what I do is watch this video: <a href="">
Those legs tho

any links to the studies mentioned in this talk?

Brilliant!

I feel I have the wrong stress. its not the stress its self but the type.

I feel I have the wrong stress. its not the stress its self but the type.

That when u feel bad about any thing in ur life The beast thing to do find someone less Fortune than u helps them it will make u feel Ecstatic

The way she speaks the word &quot;body&quot; it tickles my feathers.

Well thanks for this idea

Even though this talk is 6 years old already, I felt that it is still a useful talk. I am the guy who have an experience with stress issue. But after listen to this talk, it totally change my way of thinking. :)

Is that mechanism also work for believing &lt;8hours sleep is good?

I&#39;ve actually found, as someone who has suffered with chronic anxiety, that when I purposefully tried to view my bodies anxious response/symptoms just as excitement or something else POSITIVE, it has helped! Super important topic!!!

I like how people are laughing each time she mentions the deaths of thousands upon thousands of people.

Those big blue eyes!
hey

That was so incredible I really needed that ️

What if you have no friends

Truth strengthens us. Love it.

very nice

Sorry but how many people where actually checked after they died? People with a lot of stress can get hit by busses more often because they think about a lot of things but things like this are not in the study i bet 100% sure.

It&#39;s remarkable
Sometimes stress is good for us.

Hi stress, I’m dad
One of the greatest Ted Talks ! That is a lot ! very awesome vision

This is a load of horseshit. Bunch of junk pop psych with junk stats to give people the illusion that anyone can help themselves with just a hug and a thought. So totally off base and unrealistic. I&#39;ve experienced a burn out and had friends who burned out. Life isnt just made easy by a positive affirmation.

<a href="">4:46</a> &quot;STOPPPP That guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again.&quot; Me: <a href="">

 awesome! Very motivating speech on stress. It makes sense.
really funny

it is really amazing
Expectations and then stress.Any kind of expectation in life will cause stress if you couldn&#39;t make your expectations.

Has anyone from Indonesia watched this video?
Good speech

This is a good ted that I ever been listen. I would TED get up more this speaking.

incorrect
Well said

I use to smoke and drink a lot for last 5 years and with a break and i was suffering from stress from long time i try many modern day treatment but have no relief in my symptoms. one day i found stress support capsules from a <a href="">#website</a> PlanetAyurveda(dot)(Com) i am taking the treatment from last 3 months with diet and found very good results in my symptoms and stop drinking and smoking.I used to work in proper way and i recommend other to <a href="">#quitsmoking</a> and live a <a href="">#healthy</a> life with <a href="">#nature</a>

A GREAT COSMIC WINKTHANK YOU KELLY.

This is true but only if the stress is for short time while you need it for to do what you must do, it means, to do something that requires effort. The trouble shows up when stress is for long, long time due to it activates survival mechanisms which maintained over time, harms our organs because of adrenaline and cortisol.

In general, he wants to say, those who believe and do good deeds, there is no fear against them, and there is no fear of them.
This is one of the best Ted talk that i have seen !

Hatts off to u 

hi

Beautiful Kelly

I love it

Blackpink

I&#39;m stressed about her &#39;&#39;s&#39; sound. It&#39;s driving me nuts.

Benefit or harm

Hearing the word stress a billion times in this video was stressful.

We all related each other <a href="">11:47</a>

Stress is very harmful to the human body and changes social systems.
This video was one of the main factors behind the launching of my sports consultancy career.<a href="">  , The best 14 minutes video you would ever watch

She reminds me of Gina from brooklyn 99 except a smart version

Me respond to STRESS: W O W

TED wow i found you to teach me to be good speaker than i did. I only need to imitate the way how she in this video either he in other videos  explain, smile, support, body language and many others! Anyway i am trying harder to understand the meaning without reading subtitle

10.14 - Heart cells can not REGENERATE. They are permanent cells of the body that can only heal via scar tissue formation, regeneration is not possible. Please don&#39;t spread pseudo science!

My new friend stress

You&#39;ve changed my perspective . From now stres is my best friend. Thank you a lot. İ can stay here forever  to watching and listening you.. love you 

What about cortisol?

The laughter was so uncomfortable...Why was she even prompting people to laugh at death stats?  I&#39;m stressed.

It is not stress that is beneficial, but courage, in her own words. Stress is a challenge, courage is the answer
Interesting i always thought about this thanks for clearing it up

This is some stupid bullshit.

She is both beautiful and smart.

the thing is most of these surveys and data cant be belived . they could simply be bullshit. u can come up with any numbers u want so stop using these surveys to prove ur point

Amazing speech
Great

being a friend with stress

I need a hit of Oxytocin.

Thank you for this nice talk and I&#39;m amazed that only now we discover the Oxytocin hormone and how this can be increased by getting close to the people we love! 1500 years ago this was already discovered by prophet Muhammad and in Qura&#39;an. Prophet Muhammad said that: Uterine connection ( close relatives), good manners and respecting your neighbors would increase your happiness and increases your live and there are many sentences in Quraan which talks about this.

I get stressed just by watching this

Thank you so much

i get stressed a lot, going to try this out and see how it goes, AMA

I wonder how this translates to a brain with asd. I know I have lower levels of oxytocin than neurotypical people but get stressed out a lot easier so I&#39;m wondering how trying to translate this way of thinking will work for me 

This is interesting to me. I told my partner recently that I thought i made myself anxious or mad sometimes because i was very low on energy and i knew that it would increase that for me

I survived stress in my stressful job because I choose not to face it alone! I am surviving because of my hope and faith in my Lord Jesus Christ my saviour. He said in Ps 46:1 that he is my refuse, my strength and my very present help in times of trouble! Yay! I am more than conqueror!

Ahahaha

I hope the lady psychologist is still reading commentsGood news is:True and true...but...here is the  but,..The bad news is, poeple who suffer chronic stress ( financial, family crises ( plural)) who are still alive because during their crises they had a tsunami of oxytocin secretion which helped them help a village worth of poeple AND..they recieved zero help when they needed it...have an emotional denaturalization and become fifth generation deep monks who see life , from the same window that those who died would see it...non-interactive , single way road towards nothingnessOnly fifth generation monks will appreciate what I saidIn other words life to be healthy and balanced mandates give and take, requires mutual understanding and...COMPASSIONWhen thess are absent, it is a&#39; living dead&#39; situationOne gives,  even during dire circumstances,  supports and helps outAnd is abandoned when needs help, equals&#39; living dead&#39;The only way someone on this planet from the neuroendocrinal species of human beings can LIVE in a balanced manner, is by having close ones or others care about him or her... When no one cares about him or her, by death, by immigration, by many other reasons...one becomes in a viable but vulnerable condition, a.k.a. living dead

She is awesome.

Good job Kelly

OMG, If Oxytocin is released during stress, maybe that is the answer to my long-term question: Why we bond to our abusers.

beautiful and useful
me: stress, let&#39;s be friends stress: k

People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.

🇹🇷 turkey 2019
The speaker is insanely attractive.

It is beutifill speech, stress is one of the epidermics diseases of death

Take a shot every time she says &quot;stress&quot;

Don&#39;t get mad Kelly.REMEMBER. Stress is your FRIEND.La la la.<b>Eyebrow twitches</b>

So charming and good-looking, right?
All this time i felt when stressed isolate myself. Boy was I wrong thank you one love

OK.  Stress response as natural body response to deal with challenge is appreciable.  But what about stress response triggered by internal conflicts or stress response triggered by wrong or inappropriate perception. Stresses can not be avoided totally and are part and parcel of life and has to be accepted with positive attitude.  But activation of stress response has to be switched off once the challenging situation is dealt and relaxation response has to be activated even while continue to engage with the situation in positive calm manner.  Stress can be friendly but prolonged stress response can not be friendly.

Who’s here because the ASU orientation has you watch this :)!

That&#39;s all well and fine except. I think your a robot.

forturnessly, i usually care about my friends and my relationships. thansks for your article

It&#39;s not (only) about a belief, it&#39;s about social support.

The Best talk video about stress I have ever seen in my life....Thank you Madam....
What should I do if the only reason for my stress is “College “

I wish the title said,  How to make Stress &quot;As&quot; your friend

What about anxety?

Good for stress Yoga System

And when oxytocin is released .....(<a href="">9:09</a>) this is exactly what is happening with me!!!

Bingo!

Looking at stress a different way makes a huge difference! I&#39;m enjoying &quot;The Upside Of Stress&quot;

So your boss will tell you “you are not capable of managing the stress. Your stress is because you can’t handle challenges. It is not because you work over time with little pay” Most of the time TED TALK is align with the establishment. Trying to make us think what is convinient for companies.

Reference list please?

On The line To Follow You Ways.

Thank you so much It seems amazing

play at x1.5 thank me later

wow

OMG she&#39;s so beautiful!Edit: No, I don&#39;t regret typing it at 3 am after getting high

love it!!!!!!!

damn
Powerful speech 
Yes  your attitude to stress matters. This does not mean you can conclude that prolonged stress is healthy.

Stress makes me wanna kill myself so i don&#39;t think this is a good feeling

Damn, I&#39;m dumb. That title had me fucked up for a minute lol.

People are given lots of stress by how the society is set up.  Get rid of the banking families - that will make people less stressed.

I think of stress, suffering and  hardship to be of great wisdom, understanding of life and honor to share a little of what Jesus Christ went through.  It shows us how evil works first hand, it shows us what evil looks like and we learn how to deal with evil.  The Father most high will show us by having faith in him and obeying him.  We can push farther in better condition in reaching our goal of not being changed by our surcumstances.  From experience I can tell you that still small voice is real, glory is real and The Father Most Highis real.  Cause the outcome of believing in the Father will buckle your legs to your knees in complete tears of overwhelming accomplishment.  That makes everything you suffered a blessing.  I believe at that moment your at the feet of the Father Most High.  Giving praise, worship and glory to the Father Most High.  From that moment on your never the same.  Cause you really do begin to have true faith that there is something I call the Father most high, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.  Who is always with us if we just find the time to be still and silent till we hear his still soft voice.  Sorry so long

“It is not a sign of health to be well adjusted to a sick society.” - J. Krishnamurti

Loved this! Thank you so much for giving us the belief and mindset to be better at managing stress. One question for Kelly McGonial: If stress makes you more social, how does it impact people who naturally get more stressed by being in social situations? Would the stress acting/pushing them to be more social help them or hurt them?

Wow it&#39;s amazing 

And what if I stressed whilst communicating with people...

Does this science still hold today?

I&#39;m a new university student, and I feel like this may help me in ways I could have never imagined!

I appreciate you. This was brilliant ️

I love TED Talks, but where&#39;s the bibliography? I&#39;d love to tell my acting and performance students about &quot;creating resilience&quot; and &quot;the biology of courage&quot;, but I&#39;d have to say &quot;I heard about it on a TED Talk, but there was no citation, so you&#39;ll either have to take my word for it or find the reference for yourself&quot;. I hope this improves over time.

&quot;Go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.&quot; That&#39;s an amazing sentence.

why was everyone laughing at the statistics of stress related death...

You know, I always did make the most friends in my hardest classes!

8.4 Million people just watched a video that can change your life

It was motivational.  Loved it

Reaching out to someone is a way to create stress resilience. Wow. Interesting facts

It&#39;s not stress just it&#39;s a feeling of power

for some reason I think we&#39;ve been having a different definition for stress. I&#39;m not saying that i/she was thinking wrong, I just think she was talking about something else

Very good!

&quot; Go after what it is that gives you meaning in life, and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows&quot;

Hold on. Just because the people who rate stress as harmful die, doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s why they died. That&#39;s a frail connection, isn&#39;t it?

It&#39;s not harmful it depends on how we using that stress!!

I would like to thank Tede for these wonderful interviews.
Huh, I guess I need more oxytocin.Time to go snort it

Maybe it&#39;s related with those healthy beliefs about Buddhism and meditation.

I needed to watch this

&quot;And so I would say that&#39;s really the best way to make decisions, is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows&quot;.

Stress is an access to heart of compassion and empathy. We are already equiped with coping mechanism in our body. Thank you for sharing amazing knowlege about human body.

Wht a genious lady im impressed by her intelligence

&quot;Prof. McGonigal is always right, Harry. Listen to her.&quot;

I love you lady, you just gave  awesome ideas that may lead to salvage of so many innocent lives under the stress created by the demons.Those lives are going to become super humans and help the humanity one day.Thank you so much for listening to our hearts ( the most stressfull ones) and motivating us to get over these f**kin challenges.

Great, I can already see some CEOs and managers tell their employees: &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not the 80h week, it&#39;s your attitude. Watch this video!&quot;

No .. stress are so dangerous .. not any benefits ..i could reach out people without disasters in my life .. she seems a nice lady ..all she said   seems pretty nice and right  but in fact it&#39;s all wrong

Hearing <b>Stress</b> again &amp; again ... Really stressed me out.... Just like Audience ...

Stress make u intelligent ,stress created by very close people 

This speech is quite good apart from the part :  heart cells can regenerate. This is incorrect.

try practicing step 10 of the AA programme till it becomes intuitive !? you&#39;ll be amazed !

“Go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and believe that you handle the stress that follows.”

Unfortunately, personally, I was feeling stressed throughout the  video. Maybe, it was the fact that experiments were conducted, or maybe the fact that the word &quot;stress&quot; was mentioned so much or the fact that &quot;death&quot; was immutably linked to &quot;stress&quot;. A better approach is to simply accept the fact that stress is a condition or state in life. It acts as a stepping stone toward defeating a challenge, pausing a course, or letting us experience the moment until something changes or moves within us. And also with &quot;joy and courage&quot;, as mentioned in the video, it may stem from that challenge of stress and help release stress hormones while we benefit from of our inner bodily responses, and rapid synaptic junctions in our cerebrum helping propel more joy or courage, or disappointment, resilience, strength, hope, and courage. Like the 12th steps plan, we should fight and find our own action plans to lifts us higher to greater heights in a case and lie instead of surviving.

No wonder why she looks so young!!! Best ted talk ever

Best TED Talk I&#39;ve ever heard. Thank you Kelly.

Well if you are experiencing stress, or issues related to “stress” as harmful to your health then yes perhaps you are probably more likely to die of it, however that does not mean that it was your belief that caused you to die. That would be , and is, ridiculous to say! Perhaps the correlation reflected an accurate assessment of the effects of stress and its likelihood to be harmful to  health the fact that they died would perhaps even confirm that?. Typical misuse and misunderstanding of scientific method to project unsupported and unsupportable meaning onto date. Hmm perhaps chasing meaning isn’t so great after all. Though you can bet with this attitude shes going to brush off any well founded critiques.

The flashbacks to Tokyo ghoul torture scene

This may be true for people who don&#39;t have PTSD.  Workaholics thrive on stress but as much as I enjoy it my organs barely function and I maintain a massive amount of swelling and have most of the stress related illnesses.  Changing your mind&#39;s experience of stress does not change your body&#39;s experience of stress hormones.

Remember that you are not facing it alone, but really what makes us different is how we react.

You don&#39;t face them alone

one of the best Ted talks

Just add stress to your to do list :D you will notice that you can&#39;t be stressed as you are willing!! Mind trick :D :D

Game changer.
i got to say  more ,oldness and death from that one also is result of your beliefs

Fantastic talk ! thank you !!

I have an odd problem : my brain alsways against anything i want to make it right. Who can help me fix it?

extraordinaire  super (Y) &lt;3
If you want to friend with stress then come play dota  2

Means to help other reduce your stress level... Thanks for sharing such  a great and positive thoughts.

But how do you view stress as something helpful? When it makes you feel like that? I didn’t get her point. Can someone explain this to me?

EXCELLENT, BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOME.AND ALSO YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
Wow new topic

I&#39;ve stopped at <a href="">2:52</a> to say this - it&#39;s probably the placebo effect

<a href="">1:29</a> in that study 30,000 adults were tracked. <a href="">2:30</a> 182,000 have died?What am I missing?

Thanks for reminding me this video Kelly it made me feel much better God bless you.

Wonderful, marvelous and  amazing

she&quot;s beautiful ! i just woke up at 7:20 am and she was talking...nice way to wake up to a meaningful conversation !

Those pants though...

She thinks stress is psychosomatic?  Sounds like a quack.  Go tell starving abused children to just get over it.

i sleep

Wow this is exactly the message I needed right now, thank you

She is really in stress and does not know how to be happy...fool

&quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.&quot; That&#39;s a real good way of looking at it. :o

That is stupid.

nice

Interesting how the society nowadays want to change the meaning of stress. What is the reason? I think they want to we work more and more forgetting about stress . Like being happy slaves! And they know how to do this getting this speech to psicologists. I don’t trust in them

Who is this person who comes at the end? He looks like one of the Hollywood actors.Edit: he&#39;s the director of TED but he very much looks like an unknown Hollywood actor. If you recognize,.please let me know. I have a great OCD.

Prouda her

Wow just wow

Is she acquainted to any McGonagall we know?

Disagree 100%! We are made of Particles and live in Universe. What we are doing on Planet Earth, is a Simulation which is made by US, Humans. Things like Money, God and Property, don’t exist in Universe, so consider it all as a Simulation of carrying Peaceful Life and so enjoy the Simulation and take it easy as neither Money exists, nor Success in Society. And when our beloved leave us, in this Universe, they always exist!! Take it easy, nothing is real, except Love!!

Now over 2000 women are more powerful.
I thought the topic is “how to make your friend stressed”

so basically, me that is a Lonewolf and don&#39;t really  socialize with people will die very soon :P

Fear can kill person ,with ulcer, in less timeBut courage can make person, with cancer, live for long time...My point is fear causes stress

Remember, may God remember you
so i make stress and it&#39;ll leave me as well ,noice

This is a great talk but I also fear that it might add pressure to people who already feel very pressured. This is the kind of science that might be an ally for people to control others and increase the already insane workloads we consider “normal”. What about self-care? What if THAT is the true meaning of life. To do less. To just be ok with being who we are. As is.

I will die soon! To bad I don’t care I will only stress about not Caring

Wow. This was amazing. I was captivated listening to her, this idea is wonderful. She’s also a fantastic speaker. Thank you!

I can trust myself to handle life&#39;s challenges.

&quot;When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage&quot; 

Is it only me who thinks she sounds sexy, how she ends her sentences.

Wow, such composure in the talk! The advice is truly life changing. Thank you, Kelly. I see so many things from your eyes.

Is there any scientific evidence?
Great work
By seeing stress as something that prepares and motivates your body to take on a challenge, stress changes from something that is harmful to your body to something that is good for your health. The important thing is not to avoid stress, but to see it as something positive for you. Additionally, oxytocin, a hormone that makes us more sociable, is secreted in response to stress. In other words, when you feel stressed, your body is telling you to seek help. Also, when oxytocin is secreted in response to stress, the receptors are located in the heart. It is known to heal damage to the heart and strengthen it. The experience of being helped by someone under stress and helping someone under stress is an important way to improve your physical and mental health.
Smh

Such a great thought

How does this relate to generalized anxiety disorder?

Could you possibly make me a personal case study ? and see what it would do for A-Fib , and Apnea , waking and sleep.Too much stress in my life , and , so glad I watched this . Before my second heart Ablation ,  9 hours from now .Your smile would open my blood vessels pronto . (I mean that in the nicest way)

<b>Care to Survive</b>Nice play by the nature 

So...people who deal with chronic stress alone without any type of support system are essentially ticking time bombs unless they are providing care and support to others? Seems counterintuitive possibly amplifying the neagtive effects of stress.

Does this talk bolsters the point Amy cuddy said in the book &#39;Presence&#39; that is fear to excitement

Good your idea, thank you so much

What if you&#39;re stressed because you&#39;re constantly helping people and everyone needs something from you?

wow. this helps a lot

S/L Class .. fanshawe college 2019

This is my body helping me to rise this challenge.

I&#39;m stressed at how TED talks insist their speakers pretend they&#39;re not reading or have memorised a scriptit makes them appear like robots as though they&#39;re acting like performers performing a in playits a very weird effect

Stress is associated with negativity as opposed to positivity. Stress is a good thing, it encourages us to act. It is almost like the mindset of &quot;I am nervous&quot; as opposed to &quot;I am excited&quot;. Same symptoms, different attitudes.

She&#39;s so hot, now i am very stressed that i can&#39;t have her.

Me lot of stress

great speech! thanks!

One of the best Ted talks that I’ve heard!  Very informative....thank you!!

Good lesson
Am I the only one who read the title as “How to make your friend stress” 

Another example of the benefits of HORMESIS.  And, she is hot.

&quot;Caring created resilience.&quot; What a powerful connection.

Are they twins with Jane McGonigal??? They look the same... Mindblowing

I&#39;m in love;)

Very nice. Thank you

Living in stupid societies increases stress, nervousness, and anxiety
After ten years, I will come back to see this comment. Love from Vietnam

Brutal.

the drama queen
Wowee! This is fantastic information Kelly  thank you ever so much, who knows u may have just saved dozens of others &amp; my life, thank you 

“how you think and how you act can change your experience of stress. ”›choose to view your stress response (heart pounding, palm sweaty, etc) as helpful, it&#39;ll bring joy and courage into your life.›choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.Literally the whole point is CHANGING OUR VIEW about our stress response, and BUILDING CONNECTION with someone during stress moment, to be happier and healthier also live longer.Good luck everyone!

I love Ted talks they are so thought provoking and inspiring, they make you really question what is possible 

Put footnotes on the description plz

Amazing talk, really makes me think about how I react to  and manage the stresses in life! 

Y 996 ?
So, she indirectly killed all those people

Maybe thinking stress is good makes you less stress. It&#39;s not that thinking stress is healthy makes your stress being healthy but it make you less stress and by doing that you&#39;re healthier, and stress is still bad.

Measuring &quot;Death&quot; in order to prove a hypothesis, is over-simplification of how our systems work. There are just too many factors involved. If the experiments would have proved that it improved our daily lives in some way, would have been a better parameter

Great tanx madam
get help lady you are stressed

this is open minded mind.gongrats.

Relax under a cold shower, good way to learn

I&#39;d really like to know which studies McGonigal was talking about - they sound very interesting. Does anyone know the titles or authors? :)

hahaahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahajkfdjgfjgiufjjrgirfnigfhnfjg
I know that I look like an uneducated pervert, but she is damn hot!



Light comes from the moon not from the stars Friendship comes from one not from thousands 
I totally agree with what you said and I have practiced the same strategies for the past 20 years. The outcomes have been stunning and I would like to share this to as many people as I can.

Can I get references to the studies she mentions? Thanks :-)

who here after anveshi jain stroy ?

Kudos to this beautiful person to admit when she&#39;s wrong. A marvelous speech and an amazing lesson told.

Honestly....This Was The Most Awesome TED Talk I&#39;ve Seen In <b>Years</b> or <b>Aeons</b>And Mind It I&#39;m A Lifelong Ted Viewer

You guys who facinasted with stress pls figure out method to deal with it You would never can imagine how bad stress affects to you. Stress for a long time can depressed. Gradually lead to depression. And “depression” become big issue, it’s getting harder to living with.

best talk in ted talk

Hmmmm, I'm definitely going to die.
shut up lispy

Studies say that studies mentioned in TED talks are pulled from thin air.

Almost 6 years later I stumbled on this, and WOW, what a game changer.

I luved this talk.....

Hm...she looks a little stressed up there.

&quot;Go after that creates MEANING for your life and trust yourself to handle the stress that follows&quot; - Made me think! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!
If you have a time. Please visit my YouTube channel and subscribe please. 

Wow nice content

Has anyone seen the researches that Mrs is talking about?

That was really useful!!!

This talk happens when people do not know how to design and/or interpret experiments. He is talking super generically about stress and not everything is like that.
Never stress If we can handle our mind quite. Stress is concept from evil, how to make our mentality down and we can&#39;t to handle. We can&#39;t see the evil when stress comes, although we using telescope where  is something we can&#39;t see comes.

Beautiful....Loved it...Tq

sounds like a reason people like me want to find one night stands and act like an ozzie

This video is amazing.

Fantastic!
That is what i have been trying to these days and this video has given me a sign to carry on :-) i would recommend the video to my friends and family! thanks for the video!

‘strahss’

Amazing
Âmzing

Great video

I have watched this over three times... And still interesting

I read this blog post (that for the life of me I couldn&#39;t find) about this person who believed that the way school was built is incredibly bad for physical and mental health. No, they aren&#39;t saying that the gym classes suck, or that the stress is too much, they were talking about how the amount of homework leads to lack of sleep and staying awake. Because you&#39;re under so much pressure, you stay awake because of all the glucose being broken down into ATP. The increased amount of glucose in your blood-stream so constantly can lead to type 2 diabetes. The constant pressure to study instead of hanging out with friends, as is proven in the video, could make stress less helpful and even a little harmful. The combination of this and constant work (think of how week-ends aren&#39;t really breaks because you spend all your time studying/doing hw, or how on major breaks like summer break or winter break hw is still given) can lead to the deterioration of mental health and physical health. This deterioration is often blamed on &quot;hormones&quot; and being a teenager, ruining health of students further because they can talk to less people now that most won&#39;t listen because it&#39;s just &quot;hormones&quot;. In conclusion, school is an amazing and beautiful concept of learning and knowing how the world works that people have ruined and twisted into an unhealthy, awful requirement to the point of students preferring natural disasters and sickness to it. Thanks, public schools.

But how do you die from thinking something is bad?

I feel stress always by my academic works. I will try to change my altitude of stress in a more positive way. Good Luck to me and all of you. Hope to have a better life without the negative thought of stress. Stress may sometimes push me to a better way. I am trying to improve my English, are there any mistakes in the above sentences?

To bring hope to those who see none is nothing short of amazing. The speaker beautifully illustrates how those drowning in stress can recover from the daily pressure tests they face through a change in outlook. In my opinion the ability to share and care for each other is the most powerful weapon we have against the daily battle of stress. When we share our problems and help each other we find new perspective into our old problems. You can sum up this video in one sentence. Sometimes to live life to the fullest we have to take a leap of faith together past the stress hurdles we face.

xnxxx video
Very profound talk!

I would do her.

At about <a href="">11:50</a> she says &quot;caring created resilience.&quot;  I would be interested in finding out what the terms of said care were.  If it&#39;s something the person feels obligated to do and does not want to do then I can see that exacerbating the stress response and its issues.

This is good, appreciate Kelly&#39;s talk and body of work -- keep in mind she is describing how things are supposed to work when development goes ideally.  A bit of missing context to keep in mind is that  there are people (e.g., early developmental trauma) for whom social contact/intimacy etc. causes the stress response rather than being soothing.  It can be a long path to get that nervous system to the point where intimacy stops alerting the alarm system (esp. helpful to understand this is Stephen Porges polyvagal theory).

Thousands of years ago, one of the wisest men that ever lived gave us the same message but with the huge difference of telling us  HOW to achieve it!!!  It was  Buddha and his technique was the vipassana meditation!!!

What you believe, you believe.. the mind-body effect is too strong and real.
Sub to my channel for more stress relief

What a different way to view stress. As someone that lives in a daily environment of high energy, fast pace, and high stress I think this will help a lot.

in your BAAAAAAADY

That&#39;s not  completely true. Your heart cells can&#39;t divide so when something makes them damage to this organ you can&#39;t repare. This is why there is a golden hour in heart attack protocols. In fact there are another parts of your body that can&#39;t be repaired like your brains  and muscle cells. This process of &quot;reparation&quot; is the fibrosis. Which put fibrocytes in the empty zones to produce collagen. This could be considered a anatomical reparation but not a physiological reparation. That why when you got a heart attack you organ bomb less blood

This all theories, study so hard still fail.

* Watches this speech before all exams &amp; speeches *

Great speech.

It has a point. Whoever has been in the military knows what is constant stress. However the levels of sickness due to stress is less than in other jobs. I guess you get used to....

I loved it and it helped me a lot
All I can conclude is let everything go on in a natural way. As a Chinese saying goes: 顺其自然 （Let nature take its course).
Pls heal me

I created the universe…love u sweetheart, you are not created…
Great speech and I got to know now that stress is actually healthy. Huge thumbs up Kelly.Continue doing more talks.

I don&#39;t think that pink pants was a good choice.

How can you become the Ted talk?

Our Subconcious mind is the main player. Just think good think positive on regular basis. You will see Difference within few days.

How she dressed, the warm colour of trousers cool coloured jacket draws your eyes to her face as she speaks her posture is tall but soft and open she makes eye contact with people in the crowd moving from person to person good hand movement the clicking of her tongue and and lips as she spoke due to the closeness of her mic and how you could hear these clicks and her breathing and how she pronounced everything with emphasis moving up and down drew your attention and made you ignore my extremely long run on sentence, she&#39;s an incredible public speaker this was an incredible talk

Great to hear we are changing our approach to stress and our perception of it can change our body&#39;s response to stress. Really helpful to know it, share it, and then practice it!

True!!!

this makes me stressed

Go after something you believe can add meaning to your life and trust that you can handle the stress that follows

Why were ppl laughing? I feel like some ppl weren&#39;t taking her thoughts about stress and the belief being the thing that causes it to be bad, which is sad to me. I thought it was a great talk!

wow

2k are under stress

definitely a must watch and without any doubt one of our favourite CUTE videos on youtube of all time!

<a href="">12:40</a> &quot;Stress give&#39;s us access to our hearts!&quot;......... &quot;wheezing cough&quot;

I don’t know how much I believe statistics on who dies and lives over stress BUT I do wholeheartedly believe mindset is everything. How we choose to deal with situations and see the world -to focus on the positive aspects of life rather than to dwell on the bad that is a choice we decide to make and in doing so I can genuinely say it has and continues to change my life for the better. Whenever I get upset or engage in negative thinking I stop myself with a gentle reminder that it’s pointless to feel in this way because 1. The only person suffering over the situation right now is me and i am self-inflicting it and 2. These feelings are emotion-driven therefore irrational which serves me no good when deciding on a choice of action of dealing with the situation to begin with. Above all, I am happier when I choose not to be upset over what I can deem to be meaningless occurrences. The choice is ours and we have more power over it than we think! Just like a muscle it is something we have to work at and shape by practicing it in our daily lives a little bit everyday! Positive social interaction is great but I don’t believe it is the end all be all — take care of yourself and your mindset first! With a positive outlook on our everyday lives and circumstances then the rest will be sure follow ~~

How do you manage Combat induced stress? Asking for the many military veterans who have profound stress.

I’m watching this to prep for a quiz in health class about stress because I forgot my notes at school and we watched this video in school. Ironically, it’s stressing me out

Stress is one of the negative emotion we have to face with in our daily life. The talk gives us a new perspective to treat it as a kind of normal feeling, which can bring positive effect to our health while the other way around may narrow our blood vessels and therefore increase our risk of cardiovascular disease.

Thanks

She is hot and cute. 

Do you believe in stress after stress!

she looks like dora

Yeah so when I can&#39;t sleep because of stress, I should just tell myself my stupid body&#39;s not ready to get over this issue... That&#39;s totally gonna work

This is an amazing talk. I have read through her book and realized it changed my life after I changed my view on stress.

this is amazing!!,

Placebo

Gosh,i feel like this is already saving my stressed life! His talk will be my prayer,like,really

Good.

O my god the part about the stress hormone opens my eyes I just realised what my friend&#39;s been doing all along unconsciously and it makes so much sense now and I can understand her better, I&#39;m so happy that I stumbled upon this video 

Ual wonderful !!!
Biology of Courage, Biology of Resilience. Fantastic TT. One of best I’ve seen. Nice job!

Great talk.
What about Cortisol?

I&#39;m so the one guy that did the standing ovation at the beginning. that was great and incredibly conversational

<a href="">#Belief</a>

I was in a stress for my college examination, now after watching this video I am really feeling well.

thes wamen is amezing....
The laughing after her talking about ppl dying is really uncomfortable 

The mind is such a powerful too.  It&#39;s amazing how many people underestimate theirs

None of this is a coincidence. How can something as simple as stress be so complicated? How come human interaction is helpful for us? This science is too complicated to have come about by happenstance. It only makes sense that we were made by a caring God, who has created ways for our body to thrive and fight the influence of sin in our lives.

Nomi

great.

Oh yeah yeah

Thank you, Kelly and Jane, for the relieving impact on my life regarding what I intuitiveley saw as true. Believe in god and &quot;Self&quot;-confidence is the way.Thank you both for your honesty and for being courageous enough to show your emotions regarding this topic - it is clear that this was something coming from heart-felt conviction

This just made me more stressful.

<a href="">02:30</a>

Best TED talk everThanks so much

Was this from the Fringe Festival?

My...so many people mixing up correlation and causation ! To me, this whole speech sounds like &quot;you suffer from anxiety ? well, it&#39;s your own fault.&quot; Let healthy people blame the ill ones. Worse ! tell them that it&#39;s because they&#39;re not helpful enough, caring enough, compassionate enough that stress affect them like this (because apparently, &quot;goog&quot; people are prepared to face stress by being good. So, you the stressfull one, you must be a bad person. OBVIOUSLY !)Also, keep on saying that people NEED interraction and to be with friends and family and to huge everyone coming at arm lenght...it&#39;s not blaming introverted people AT ALL !!!!

Brilliant. I love every aspect of this speech. Well done.

I love this.

One of the best if not the best talk in TED, I have hear. Thank you

I should have found it before!!

&quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. The best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows. &quot;

I cried sometimes we take our parents from granted from now on im gonna show my love for them by hugging them so they will stay in the world for a long time BEST TED TALK EVER

At least I will have friend

GOOGLE: ACE Study, AND Polyvagal Theory

Stress caused by fear will still increase mortality % regardless of thought. Any event that causes fear bypasses this videos whole idea of stress.

I don&#39;t think this is funny at all. Why are people laughing at the 15 largest cause of death?

She is a person who know what she&#39;s talking about. I rather like this professional presentations than cheap talks about personal life. Big thumbs up for the lady.

this video makes me stressed

That&#39;s just amazing

What a flawed logic!!! Those that believe stress affects them FEEL IT IN THEIR BODY!!That&#39;s why they believe it. Those that don&#39;t believe, simply don&#39;t see any change in their body. Psychologists have the lowest IQ among scientists. I saw the paper the P values are near 0.5 and the difference is very little. Don&#39;t simply believe in whatever she says even if interesting!

My 29kg worth of coffee makes me feel comfortable around stress.

<b>boOody</b>i&#39;m sorry you&#39;re great

there&#39;s a problem with the definition of &#39;stress&#39;. &#39;Stress&#39; is not when your heart pounds because you are on a rollercoaster. This is pollyannish bullshit. Real stress is the bad stuff of life, specifically the part related to existentialism: illness, isolation, old age (which will very well include illness and isolation), grief for untimely deaths, traumas.....THAT&#39;S stress. Please tell us how to stop &#39;believing that to be the case&#39;.

Thank you

Bullshit peop!e all over the word, had died of stress not because they thought stress was bad for them but because they thought that stress was not bad for them, and did nothing to combat the stress. Make stress your friend, is a form of combating stress.

Caring for me creates more stress, is that part of it? Is that what creates resilience? I&#39;m confused 

<a href="">  is a more scientific review of why reframing stress does not work!

What a great messege!

Man the placebo effect is so powerful! Life is literally what you make it!

Mash Allah .She prepared and explained a way that everyone could understand easily

Reframe

Stress is not my ugly friend any more,  after watching this show.  Thank you for the great work.

Who is this angel 

great idea

Mind over matter applies for everything, even on stress. If you don&#39;t mind it then it will not kill you. Good day everyone!

perfecto!

Best TED talk ever

all Mc XX sleep well !

I find it amazing and am awe struck that science has found how hormones and our bodies react and/or how we react physically based on our minds/thinking.  A great view/positive way to look at this subject.  *U R the what you think!  (PERSONALLY:  I love a challenge.  I love to embrace a situation and over-come it.  i.e. job related mostly.  I love to help others that are in need of great assistance.)  Society doesn&#39;t give you much kudos.  But it is C-O-U-R-A-G-E that is based on this-type action.

<a href="">4:07</a> spotted bill gates

What does this woman say about ALL the patients she has been telling the WRONG information to?  Why should anyone pay attention to her now?  She might waste everyone&#39;s time again and change her mind.  People are so full of it.

I wonder how she looks like without make up. I mean, stress is stress and they show on your physical

what these people are laughing at?

It is the most  amazing and useful video I have ever watched Like it sooooo much 

how many got through the pressure math test !!!!

Finally posted the another end of stress

Thank you so much,Kelly . Watching this again over time and, watching it alone at this time, at a dacha deep in snow near Moscow, makes me applaude your awesome speech and the WAY you made it. Thank you again.

The whole point... stress is inevitable but how you percieve it and React to it matters..Edited: thank you kelly, Big fan

She was stressed but handled it well

<a href="">12:00</a> to <a href="">13:20</a>

hundreds of likes to this video please it explains a great psychological  puzzling situations

U can correlate someones opinion  of stress with their health, but you cant decisively say that because they view stress as positive, that they are magically immune to stress factors and health risks. There could be other factors there that are being overlooked. For instance, those individualis that believed stress is positive may have genes that let them experience stress in a totally different way. Perhaps they dont suffer from panic attacks or heart arrhythmia from stress and therefore have a different outlook on what stress does. Maybe they just get a slight tingly feeling because they all socio-paths. There is an underlying cause and i highly doubt its entirely based on belief.

Wow! This talk reframes  the idea that stress  is actually &quot;good&quot;....*..within reason...social connections. ..absolutely necessary. ..<a href="">#themoreyouknow</a>

Parkour 101

Great – it&#39;s like in a yoga class when the teacher tells you a pose is going to be hard you never do as well at it, but when they make it feel normal and achievable more people succeed!

I am going to challenge myself and take part in 3-minute public speaking! It is stressful but it is meaningful.

Caring for others! I knew it. We are having less and less of it.

Is absolutely no one going to talk about her name being McGonigal and her actually looking like a young Prof McGonagall?

Thanks so much for sharing!What if you can&#39;t pinpoint the root cause of your stress?

And so the question is...I wonder if this works over social media or if it requires more of the other human qualities of contact, eye contact, etc.. my guess is it does not and that is the flaw with &quot;social&quot; over media.

Thank you, Dr. Kelly McGonigal for sharing this study. It&#39;s not only informative but also profound how one person should tackle challenges in life. This talk changes my perspective of stress, my body and helping out other people. Thank you so much! Thank you TED Talks.

I loved the speech! She is awesome

Beautiful presentation,and revolutionary findings

One of the most inspiring talks I&#39;ve ever watched!

The psychologist helps us change our perception about stress. The most common belief that stress is harmful in a number of ways is even more harmful. Stress is something we think a lot about and that&#39;s what makes it more dangerous. Under stressful situations, one must focus on finding the solutions rather than thinking about the problem itself. Certain healthy  stress responses in one&#39;s self lead to better outcomes. We come up with better ideas to deal  with situation s once we have a control over our stress. We can control our mind to work in a positive direction by staying free from anxieties and worries.Thus, the way we look towards stress and act accordingly matters a lot.

I thought being stressed out was not so good. But if you change your mind that stress is helpful,  the body changes and shows a different reaction. And if you help another people, you can not only be a better person but also be healthy. This information is new for me. I&#39;ll try to make my stress into joy and courage.

wow...thank you very much

It’s good to know..thanks very much.good luck for your guys ..

You might have not to see the actual stress yet...

I was in a lot of stress trying to figure out my life, my education and how i could help my family. This helped me realize a lot of things in life. Things i could share that could help other people. So that&#39;s what i did, i became the friend you always talk to when you have a problem and that made me happy, it made me excited that i was helping and the joy after knowing how things turned out for them after you&#39;ve helped them, it&#39;s amazing. What i did wrong though was i made it a distraction, i was hit by the saying, &quot;that&#39;s why you always try to fix others, coz you can&#39;t fix yourself&quot; right now i am trying to find myself, trying to help myself, to become better. So i could my family, my friends, and other people in need.

I started the video thinking about how could I make someone&#39;s life better... Now I&#39;m 100% sure I have reason to do it, thank you!

So basically what you believe u become!!

Great topic, Thank you McGonigal.

We have to learn how to respond to stress thanks

Can you imagine that there are entire non-governmental societies that cause stress to people? One of them is Scintheology, and different sects or religious groups,
Sometime we just let&#39;s it go

Your words are so magical that it makes me wonder if you&#39;re a magician/witch. A most sincere thanks from a stressed out person. - Analysis Paralysis

The speaker very exciting. Because It&#39;s come exhalation, She look like stressfully. Even so thank you so much this topic

Exam Stress!!!
Random thought: she looks like brittany snow.

Until now I will start to hug everyone I like.

Shes so hot! Something about a woman who is passionate and confident... I hope my kids, if one  or both is a girl, grows up to be like that

Amazing video, surelly one of the bests ted talks, now I&#39;m determined to make of the stress a close friend of mine, I appreciate espicially the scientific analysis of your approach. Thank you!

KARRRUUUUUU :DDDDDDDD YARRRRRRDDDIIIIMMMM EDDDİİNNNN PLEASE SEVEN TOPRAK ATSINNNNNN
Women TED speakers are so annoying. Their voices gahhhhh what’s up with that valley girl uptalk

look at her name she teaches at hogwarts

Great topic

How did &quot;they&quot; know that the people that died from stress thought that &quot;stress was bad for you&quot; ? Further, how did &quot;they&quot; know that they died from &quot;stress&quot;. Stopped watching .

her VOICE stresses me out her eyes say she is on a stimulant

Nice presentation, nice face, and bad trouser colour!

When I look at her I have less stress

This lady was straight talking to my soul near the end there.

Wow, I just realized the way I feel is entirely scientific. I genuinely think I am just flooded with Oxytocin.

Sam played this in class today.
This has literally. CHANGED. MY. LIFE.

Interesting...this is very helpful. The Bible makes the same claim.

I mean I get the point she was making about stress being a &quot;major cause of death&quot; but like the people most likely died from sicknesses that were on the list, so I don&#39;t understand how the study &quot;shocked&quot; her. (i get it she was just making a point, but its 3am and im thinking too much abt things lol)

Loved this.

This video is trash

Of course he is going on stage

So disappointing that this has less subscribers and views than Logan/Jake Paul or &quot;kylie Jenner pregnant w twins?&quot; I don&#39;t mean to say that these people are bad but I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m disappointed in the human race.

Wow! I knew stress was bad for you. But for it to be your friend wow! I thought she was great at explaining herself  and was correct, with what she was saying. This helped my friend. She  listened to this when she got stressed and learned something knew. She knew how to manage her stress.

&quot;Think of stress as your body&#39;s way of helping you rise to the challenge.&quot;

the lady is so beautiful

Amazing information for all people.  The best part is the fact that those who are helpful get actually to live better lives.

Very very good!

It turns out that all this time Awkarin took the right actions. &quot;Caring Creates Resilience Against Stress&quot;. Good job Karin!
Is she saying stress is a good thing?

This video stressed me out.

The most helpful Ted Talk i&#39;ve ever heard. This changes my life. I need to share this to everyone I care about.

True. I have experienced this after the death of a close parent.

Ted always helps me to grow up~ Thang you allSTRESS makes me develop one step forward~

Thank you very much for this Gift.

We need sources for the researchs. Otherwise this is bullshit. TED talk should demand this. Otherwhise this is just a chit chat...

Just meditate that&#39;s it that&#39;s all.but people would rather find technics.its not a solution but a bandaid.i would rather go to the root and that&#39;s only done with <a href="">meditation.like</a> Buddha said ignorant will kill the world.

Wonderful.
Thank you for making this video! It helps a lot!

This is what I need to hear.Thank you.️️️

who else is watching for their stress management class at USC?

Not helping at all, I hate stress 

hola humber

Great interpretation of stress in routine life..

The Prophet of Islam said more than 1,400 years ago: “Whoever is pleased that his provision will be expanded for him or that his path be extended, let him maintain his ties of kinship.”
Caring creates resilience ！！！！！！！ mind-blowing！！！
Yeah the joke suks

And then she adds 2 more paragraphs to explain supporting details of active social stress relief

She&#39;s a coccain head

I wish TED would list the studies mentioned, so we could review the methodology.It would just be a good practice to elevate all of us.

I simply HAD to leave a comment. I really needed this and plan to put it into practice today. Thank you!

It is true. Like I see myself and most of my mates in surgical residency become &quot;stronger&quot; even though the stress level is getting crazier each semester, due to greater responsibilities and crazy working hours. We stopped feeling down when we are stressed, instead we stand up to face the stress (mostly emergency patients, crazy consultants, etc) because we are literally CONSTANTLY faced with them. And the best thing is that we&#39;re in this together. That&#39;s how we cope and survive together.

y u look like leighton meester in the thumbnail lol

This was one of the best talks I’ve ever seen

These conclusions are stressing me out...

superb video ever
Hey, i know its hard to deal with stress! I was looking for help everywhere, and found it here: <a href=""> There is good pills that help you with stress or insomnia. There is alot stacks for you!

Please, Give me a script of this speech !!!

Brilliant insights; thank you for a great learning experience.

I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say &#39;make it your friend&#39; but instead when its happening just try and stay in the moment, hold something in your hand, and deep breath (very important) this sends a message to your nervous system to calm down. Relax and let it just do its thing instead of fighting it. walk around. That way you&#39;ll get the vasodialation she speaks of. You have to remind yourself you will not die from it. Also good to have a &#39;prepped&#39; friend or relative to know what to say and help relax you if you call. This alone really works.

nice points freedom force, gotta write those down

i know you can use stress to help you stand up to something or run really fast, or get out of a bad situation, but what about stress that gets trapped in your body all day long, not sure how to make that my friend, feels pretty destructive actually.

When the audience were laughing at the beginning I thought, okay good she is going to explain how ridiculous the interpretation of this finding is. But no, she just kept going with it. This is a CORRELATIONAL FINDING. A psychologist should know how damaging it is to exaggerate the benfis of such a finding. The people who believed stress was harmful may have smoked more, drank more, exercised less, had less fulfilling relationships and social networks etc. etc. This is why the scientific world cannot take psychologists seriously!

she ia neurologically right

Mcgonagall&#39;s speech

how can stress create joy in life ? living a compassionate life and living under stress are different things .

I don&#39;t really recognise the aspect of seeking company when stressed, i usually shut my door, lock it and put my phone in do-not-disturb mode. I do this both because conversations would steal the time that i could use to solve the tasks i&#39;m stressed about – but don&#39;t, because i&#39;m too stressed to do reasonable things (which makes it all worse) – and also because other people tend to annoy me  when i&#39;m stressed. So no, i don&#39;t really recognise this. Nonetheless i think there&#39;s a lot of truth in what she&#39;s saying, and i&#39;ll definitely try to learn from it. Goes very well with Alan Watts&#39; teachings. Hopefully companies won&#39;t hear about it and use it as an excuse to push their employees even harder...

I will help my friends as  much as possible!

stage fright, is it right?

very well said

Humans have negative and positive thinking both. The key to happiness is to hug and embrace both because both are trying to help. The reason why there is so much negativity in the world is due to suppression of negative thoughts.Everything in the society tries to remove negative thinking and produce positive thinking becausw negative thinking is destructive to society. And now in humanity. Negative thinking is the most dominant no matter how much positivity we seek.

Law of attraction

It&#39;s a beautiful work !

Hugging is good for your heart.

Stress and worry maybe two different things Stress, your sister asking to borrow your car and 5 clients call in the same dayworry,Dont have enough money to live ok in the futureCity is like doom and I need to leave but it&#39;s hard and there is not much better unless I learn another language Worry that seems unstable can make life feel like cjdjfnf.. is harmful as it can perpetuate with an uneasy feeling all day all week and all year…. Worry can be overcome by telling ones self it&#39;s not the end of the world and …  although if it is like personal unsustainable bad life  ideas will come back of it. Phycologists support  can ask the question to people who look like they have been worrying too much, their souls destroyed and their eyes bit fucked. What have you been worry about often over the last month&#39;s.  It is then the support workers job to determination if it is logical worry and if it is not help them overcome it by thinking of it better. If it is then how to overcome it by physical means and life options. Stress generally has imaginable achievable goals. Stress comes from things that are not options but must be done.  Worry has less or no practical achievable goals or looks hopeless or can from trying to do things that came from goals from stress you thought looked achievable but we&#39;re not fulfilled and even non-achieving over time 10 20 years makes them look much less achievable.  point ..  I think stress and worry are 2 different things.

I am showing that i care about others, even in stressful situation, but that also make me feel unappreciated, and feels like everyone expected that help from me, like i should be thankful i was given the chance to help them. It stresses me out even more. English is not my first languange, so forgive me if i said it wrong

good looking
Thank you Keliy, Ted, and Riwayatul for making me understand Indonesian... for helping me learn more about how to manage stress. Thank you
A balanced diet with rare processed food cheat days, being very active throughout the day and exercising 3 times a week, sleeping at least 7-8 hours &amp; staying away from cigarettes, drugs and alcohol is the key.

In my opinion, there are different types and degrees of stress and psychologically speaking about physical things. But what about the souls. She also suffers from stress

Although what she is saying has been researched and can be conclusive just remember not everything you see has been peer reviewed by the scientific community.  .Fake science is causing real harm and Seeing a real doctor can make all the difference..She is a psychologist NOT A Psychiatric doctor She cannot even say someone has an anxiety disorder.. Legally psychologists are not allowed to make a diagnosis or access a person ,only talk to them about their feelings. Where I live psychologist are not allowed to prescribe meds , Psychiatrists are doctors not Psychologists. A psychologist has a doctorate degree however are not medically trained. Yes they may hold the title “Dr” , no they are not a medical doctor. Great TED video  as usual i am  just trying to say if u feel down Go and see a real doctor and get the help you need. Mental health is important and a phycologist cannot help you with that.

I teach students about research studies for a living and struggle with their notion that a single study proves a finding. A thousand times &quot;no&quot; -- a single study proves nothing; it might just be wrong, no matter how massive or well-designed. It&#39;s called Type I error, or a false positive. The one-and-only study found something (or nothing) but because of the risk of not really finding something was deemed so low, then we are expected to simply accept the hypothesis. How can one be sure of any research finding? Look for studies that replicate the finding. If there are none, or the evidence is split somehow, then quit proclaiming &quot;truth&quot; based on a single study.

Wooow

I love how she pronounces &quot;bo-dy&quot;. So attractive and powerful woman.

Monarch Organics makes a back tickler sure to relieve stress for you. It&#39;s amazing!

That&#39;s good and new idea I hope show a lot of idea like this, new, strong and benefit for all. Thank you

Fantastic. One of the best TED talks out there.

Who is on a tedtalk spree...

Kelly’s enthusiasm is contagious! Bravo!

love it!for your happiness!somes time,i see a lady to talk a good story!that is a good jod???????

no body love you as yourself,<a href="">thanks.no</a> worry all things for your life.

I believe we only grow through resistance. But like everything else to much can crush you. Over time our bodies can learn to cope with stress.

Absolute crap
WoWWWWW/ Absolutely stunning! Exactly what I am thinking about! Thank you!!!

Damn you&#39;re hot
she&#39;s beautiful.

No offence, but clearly the people who &quot;had experienced stress, but don&#39;t believe it&#39;s bad for their health&quot; clearly have never experienced real stress and are obviously the least stressed people out of the study!

Mrs. Kelly McGonigal , i would like to thank you about this ted talk. Despite the fact that it was really interesting about my stress problem , i am really interested in the neurotransmitters , so your mentioning about the oxytocin in combination with stress was really enlightening for me. You made my day, thank you!

Awesome content and delivery! :D And the &quot;Chasing meaning is better than avoiding discomfort.&quot; hit home

Hahahahaha, this is brilliant

Strange.... If you control stress, that is not stress anymore. Thus, your body will no longer react as in a stressful situation. Control excludes stress. Thus you cannot control stress, thus you cannot model it, make it a friend or things.... Stress is like a mystery: once you dig it out, it vanishes, it goes into the &quot;might have been&quot; domain of existence. It&#39;s just a ghost...

And if we want to pull the brain into this positive physiological response... the greatest stimulator of the vegas nerve is compassion.

This was really helpful : )

Cheers
Marry a sane person

I would call this the principle of self fullfilling prophecy.

I&#39;m sure this is one of the best videos I have ever watched. I has totally changed my way of thinking towards stress. I was struggling to cope with stress before but she changed my mindset. Stress could be positive or negative but we can choose either of them. It depends on our perspectives. Since I watched this video, I have called stress challenging hormone. It actually change my physical response positively. Thank you for sharing the great idea.

Did she even mention cortisol?... if she did please say, I guess I missed it. Im not sure if she knows much about stressful situations. She said if you care for someone it makes you feel better. My wife was suicide and the stress was amazingly devastating to my body. Not sure how to look and be happy when my wife would overdose on pills , I cared for her but it wasn’t a happy stressful moment. When my wife actually succeeded in taking her life, the stress didn’t actually feel good either. So not sure how her point of be happy and stressed is valid. A study where someone is telling me to count and judge me isn’t stressful.. that’s a joke.

How can I download mp3 from TED?

from the thumbnail, I thought it was Teddy from Grey&#39;s and I was like hi hello I&#39;m here

I don’t like the tone of this talk: it turns out, it’s out fault if we don’t handle stress well? How wonderful.

So, bad news for those of us that don’t like reaching out to other people to talk about the things that stress us out. Cool, I learned nothing new.

This was extremely insightful

I really like this presentation. It simply emphasizes the power of our minds and how powerful we are naturally engineered

I really want to know who disliked this talk....just curious  

Damnnn, this is one of the best TED talks i&#39;ve ever seen.

A bomb
I have a lot to learn.

May be there is different types of &quot;stress&quot;?

I think it&#39;s amazing that a change of mindset can save your life!

She ended it so well when answering that question!

She stressing me out!

It&#39;s kind of like an subconscious nocebo effect, isn&#39;t it

Stress reminds you that you have a heart and when it does, believe in it and care for others. You&#39;ll be fine.

my heart bustin&#39; itself RN bless optimism

Thanks a lot
I’m just here for a health class trying to find someone to NOT plagiarize off of 

What an amazing speech &amp; speaker!

how many people in that audience are now dead....? 5 years...some of them are pretty old looking. sad

This applies to most emotions conditions etc. What you believe will do you harm—— WILL !! What you Believe is good for you (obviously within reason ) will be good for you,! Common sense ?

I’m under stress as of this moment with my work and thankfully that i was able to watch this presentation coz i think it will help me a lot on how i can handle my situation better.

This is what I have found. Great speech!!!

<a href="">

Whoa! You’re a hot doc!

Great speech and advice! Liked it... :-)

Yep, I’ve must of viewed this video about a couple of times now.

why I feel the loneliness when she said thank you! I thought she&#39;s about to tear.... anyways I like the talk marry me!

The last study mentioned in the minute <a href="">10:58</a> was mentioned by the Prophet Muhammad (may God’s prayers and peace be upon him) in a hadith of his where he said: Whoever is pleased that his livelihood will be expanded for him or his path will be forgotten, let him maintain his ties of kinship. In another hadith, he said: Whoever is pleased to have his lifespan extended and his livelihood increased, let him be kind to his parents and maintain his ties of kinship.
My fav TED talk

<a href=""> cool song about stress and oxitocin

can someone link me the report of the study?

That good

Ok so basically stress tells us or shows us what is truly going on? So let&#39;s say you become unhappy, agitated about a situation and that&#39;s causing you stress, you basically look at that, analyze that because stress is your friend, correct ?

* <b>raise hand too</b> *

I would love to be able to speak like her publicly

This was really great!

Interesting. But a question comes to mind. If you don&#39;t view stress as stress then is it really stress? I mean, whether something is stressful depends solely on your own experience of it. Stress is completely subjective. So if you change the view of stress, wouldn&#39;t it not be stress anymore but just something that happens?

I usually hate watching long videos of just one person talking but this is very interesting and informative

Sounds like the Hunger Games hearing all those people laugh in the audience when she talks about people dying prematurely because they believed stress was bad for them. Ok maybe some of those that laughed are those that believe stress is good for you but still cold.

mind blown on this one

How does someone put a red  on purple 

I grew to become one to enjoy exams and seek challenges... I&#39;ve always thought the heart pounding was great.

How are we supposed to think straight when our judgement is clouded because of cortisol released as a byproduct of stress? Isn&#39;t cortisol toxic for logical thinking?

Self-reported stress... hmm somehow I feel like people who didn&#39;t report stress as harmful weren&#39;t all that stressed. All stress is not equal. As much as we should change the way we look at stress and life and how we deal with it but implying that people should stay in stressful relationships and conditions because &quot;stress is good&quot; is harmful as people get worn out.

Wow.

Awesome

A must watch video on stress management: <a href="">

Best ted talk I&#39;ve ever watched.

Great meaningful lecture.......
In my experience, a mindfulness approach is more effective at managing stress, than mindlessly repeating &quot;stress is good for me...stress is good for me...stress enhances my performance....stress is good.....enhanced performance&quot; (it rarely does, it usually impairs it). But what I know to be definitely true, is that stressing exessively over being stressed, and fearing your own stress (developing a phobia), and not being mindfully present in your own body, is something that will worsen stress and its symptoms, and recovering.Here is where mindfulness comes in. Practicing it means lovingly and fully accepting whatever is the reality of the moment, the sensations of your body, instead of fleeing from it or fighting it (fleeing and fighting is afterall a stress reaction). Ignoring it won&#39;t always work either. So... having courage to literally meet and experience your own experiences right now, with accepting and loving awareness. But at the same time, you&#39;re not trying to enforce a false feeling or thought that the stress symptoms you&#39;re experiencing is comfortable, necessary or even very healthy. It just is. Accepting to meet the present as it is: sweating, heart pounding, dizziness, your shallow breathing... When you fully turn your awareness into your body and the present sensations, in a patient, non-judgemental, non-fearful and non-delusional, but loving way, the reaction softens, looses it&#39;s firm grip, de-escalates. This works better for me, than trying to believe something that could or could not be false.

Indeed you are a <a href="">orator.you</a> deserve standing ovation

The easiest way to relieve stress is when you encounter stress, you go find other things to do to deviate from your mindset and concentration of stress.

Stress is my only friend!!!

First day of college here I come!

You are your thoughts

I think this technique only works when it doesn&#39;t involve stress caused by people like when you have an intense argument with someone you care or when a friend or family member breaks your trust. It&#39;s difficult to immediately get over it or even be optimistic about this.

So really a heart of steel starts to gros the more stressed you are So you become toughter! Cool!!

Mustrubration is helpful

Thank you
Her voice stresses me. I prefer ignoring the risks of stress than being stressed by her video

You Saved my life mam thankyou Very much !

The stress dries my mouth when I have to speak in front of people I don&#39;t know. That is the way the stress try to help me?

So people handle and experience stress differently. I think we already knew that. We also knew &quot;too much&quot; stress is bad, and chronic stress is bad. And the solution is supposed to be to try to be ignorant of facts? I heavily suspect that people&#39;s stress reactions are different in severity, form and duration (even within the group that states they stress a lot), and without this being concidered, the studies can&#39;t be relied on. Here&#39;s a thought: the people who didn&#39;t suffer the penalties of their stress, are the kind of people who produce lots of oxytocin, being the people they are, having the family/friends/lover they have. This in turn (either the oxytocin ot the reason it&#39;s produced in the first place), makes them healthier all over, which again makes their stress responses (not just their restitution from it) less severe to start with, so when they state they &quot; have stressed a lot&quot;, they have milder symptoms in mind, than the other group. So, experiencing milder symptoms of stress ( but often) is concidered &quot;stresses often/a lot&quot;. The point being, the oxytocin and general health of body/brain/nervous system, which impacts how stress plays out, is the main reason it&#39;s either harmful or not, NOT their belief that stress is or isn&#39;t harmful. If this is the case, we have some problems with the studies AND the proposed oversimplified solution.

What about stress caused by sensory overloading? If a person&#39;s nervous system is sensitive to things like bright lights, sounds, visual movements and other stimuli? Is this an entirely different form of stress, and it is differentiated or excluded in the study?

I sometimes play piano. When I&#39;m not stressed, I play almost without fault, when I&#39;m stressed, I can barely hit &quot;any&quot; right notes, or move my fingers at all. How is this stress helping me &quot;deal&quot; with the situation or helping my performance in any way whatsoever, when it ruins it?

I feel it&#39;s too simplistic, she does not differentiate between different types of stress, its duration, its context, and we know nothing about the study other than correlation. What about relative perceptions of stress? One persons &quot;slightly wired&quot; is another&#39;s &quot;high stress level&quot; ? Did they only have completely healthy people in the study? A person with heart issues will be more severely impacted by stress by default. Probably so with people with hypersensitive nervous systems too, like peolpe with Aspergers or people with trauma. Or people with generalized anxiety disorder, when stress response has become &quot;hung up&quot;, and your body generally has had enough of stress and tries to tell you that in every way possible?

&quot;Thinking&quot; stress isn&#39;t bad/unhealthy doesn&#39;t automatically make you produce more oxytocin, does it? If Oxytocin (through meaningful close relations and physical contact like hugs) is the only thing that keeps my stress from becoming dangerous, then I guess I&#39;m fucked.

Kelly love u sweetheart take care God bless u ....R G G

What if the ones who reported stress to be harmful, were reporting it only because they felt other, more harmful direct effects of stress, that the people who were also stressing, didn&#39;t have? Like what if stress impacts us, not just according to our beliefs, but according to other factors, such as more obscure conditions of the nervous system. Did they test/examine these groups&#39; specific stress symptoms beforehand? Their nervous systems? Their history, or personality? What if person A stresses a lot, but it&#39;s because their version of stress are these symptoms: being a bit hyperactive, getting tired easily, restlessness, overactive mind, etc, while person&#39;s B version of stress are these symptoms: fast/irregular heartbeat, nausea, shallow breathing, sleeplessness, muscle spasms, high blood presse etc ? They both report being stressed, because they both have very different experiences of what it means, due to their past experiences, how they are wired or their general health history. Of course person A is going to think/report that they don&#39;t think stress is harmful, because for them, it&#39;s not (just annoying). While for person B, stress is harmful because they actually have other more harmful symptoms/version of it. And it&#39;s fairly easy for them to know/feel that it&#39;s not doing their body good. And what if you report &quot;stress is not harmful&quot; but you are very isolated, have no friends, have a cold family etc? Will the stress you experience then be less harmful? Which one is it?

Mcgonigal should fix that wandering eye.

She nailed it. Great speaker 

Her English is easy for me to understand, so it makes me less stress.

Jaja, great communicator!!
She is beautiful.

although this wont help me with chronic stress - being stressed 24/7 about school, even when im not at school or on a long break from it - this will be helpful for me during important short term stress inducing things. so thank you

Very good!!

Lovely

What I&#39;ve noticed was that stress in life and death situation makes me feel alive, but stress from work, where your boss is never happy with your effort even if you&#39;re working yourself to death and still have to fear that you get kicked out and all your lives planning falls apart is worse than physical pain and yet abstract.

I always have stress. I have my baby, they are make me tired.

Thank you

This is so good!

I really needed to hear this. Thank you!

<b>This might change myself and my life</b>

I have terminal Cancer with probably a  year left to live. Will adopting this strategy help me with my stress?

Thank you

I feel stressed quite often, even with the tasks I have been doing for a long time.

i was on youtube watchng a video where the guy references another youtube video, so i decided to search for it and as soon as i clicked the search bar , google auto suggested it, i ddnt even type a letterbra the machine learning is crazy

My both great feast alway closed   out why

I feel like this speech part information but also part placebo.  I wonder if she isn&#39;t deliberately confusing stress with drive in order to turn one into the other in her audience.  I heard another psychologist say that there&#39;s a difference between stress you can act on and stress you can&#39;t act on.  The stuff you can&#39;t act on, if I remember him right, is very dangerous.

I thought it would be obvious that the majority of stress is caused by factors from within rather from the outside, with inner factors causing a negative feedback loop from already existing stress from outside factors - making things worse. By this, people thinking that stress is bad for you are more likely to die from it simply because the negative feedback loop is causing them to experience even higher actual stress than those who don&#39;t actively think about stress being bad for you.

<a href="">

Wow, this is so insightful!! She definitely allows me to look at stress in a whole new way!!

I love her outfit <b>that shirt</b>

undoubtedly the best TED talk ever.She beautifully explained how we should actually respond to stress rather than escaping it. Until now i just thought that oxytocin is a hormone released by post pituitary at the time of labour to expel the fetus out of the mother&#39;s belly and one other function that it is a LOVE HORMONE and body releases it at the time when people make love with each other.I did not know about its vast circle of effects particularly those on cardiovascular system.                                                                                                     I was going through such a tough time, had so many thoughts in mind that couldn&#39;t make me sleep and i had to face a stressful situation today and watching this video as made me more confident,more energetic and more passionate about my life and the people around me.Thank you so much Kelly McGonigal WE LOVE YOU

Thank you for teaching me how to stress out my friends :D

Stress is stress. It simply is. It&#39;s about how you choose to use/view it that makes the difference. Stress that makes you sick, stress that you just hang onto is bad. But there&#39;s also stress that gets you up and running, that excitement of a new adventure, stress that motivates is good.

this video saves my life

I heard about it it really helps

A stressed attack heart attach at 50? Fucking birthday present.

Stress keeps you honest ............. and ..............

Wow amazing...clear cut-believe yourself and yeah you aren&#39;t alone to fight against...Really cool..

Trust self and know thyself.

Love you

The speaker, Kelly McGonigal, is a very effective communicator. She made sure that the words that she spoke, even the scientific ones, were understood by her listeners. The whole talk was also entertaining by the means of her effort to illustrate some words with her facial expressions and hand gestures. She was able to tackle a difficult and very scientific topic and even made the totality of the talk interesting and mind-changing. Kelly McGonigal used the <a href="">#Principlesofcommunication</a> on her speech which is perfected by her verbal and nonverbal communication.

She reduced my stress! 

If I was in charge of education system, I would have added a course from the first grade to the highest level dedicated to teaching people only one fact: &quot;correlation doesn&#39;t imply causation&quot;. Only that. Every day, every year, every level. People need to repeat that a million times during their education. If they master this one teaching, it would worth more than everything they currently learn in school. we would have a much better society if all people know this. It&#39;s amazing how many people with high education ignore this when it helps their argument. There should be criminal charges for those who deliberately abuse correlations to suggest causation.

Some important information is hidden from this presentation. Oxytocin is a stress-related hormone, it is something may not necessarily appear after a stress triggering event. To put it simple, cortisol will appear no matter what, but oxytocin may not show up after it. So, still, try to avoid stress no matter what.

The problem is that chronic stress releases cortisol yet not oxytocin. How can you be trained with an alert mind that turns everything into positive stress.

Laughter from the audiences made her speech sounds like a joke.

The sounds she makes with her mouth are terrible

The last expression she kept on her face showed me the amount of stress she handled throughout her life in transforming into thr person she currently became. I wish i can get to know more about Kelly..

It’s absolutely profound speech.

how you think about stress matters. Stress associates with heart pounding, sweat on the forehead but it helps your mind to rise up to ready for the challenge, your body will believe you and get a healthy reactioncaring other people will transform your body reaction to stress - some kind of stress resilience that will decrease the possibility of death from chronic stress. Always remember that you dont have to deal with stress alone - to find social support from others (friends, family) resulted from the oxytogen hormon.

Need some relief~
She gave me good lesson

Correlation does not prove causation. Because people who believed stress is bad tended to die more does not mean that the belief was the cause of the death.

Lol 

90p

U amazing
I&#39;M ONLY WATCHING THE VIDEO FOR HOMEWORK... Some of the things she sayed is bull, because fixing cars. You have to find out what&#39;s wrong with it everytime. ( buy a new car. Your car will be old next year). I don&#39;t see her learning how to fix car&#39;s. STRESSFUL JOB... I like it and hate it at the same time.

Loved it - never viewed stress as helpful. This turned the tables around!

Fake science..

Having PTSS ? Social anxiety?  Think this video is bringing me down!

This is awesome...hats off from me.ted talk really worth watching

it&#39;s right ...to protect our self  from stress one should think about harmful effects of strain on his body and act in positive way so that he can eliminate stress from his life....thanks kelly mam:)

I really enjoyed watching this. Kelly McGonigal makes people live healthier by telling people to care of others :D

Poised and prepared. Perfect delivery.

I can&#39;t help but think of vikings during this. they found comraderie and joy in the heart of battle. I channel this in high stress jobs by listening  to amon amarth while working

So this whole talk is based on a few psychology studies? Studies in psychology are facing a replication crisis. Stuff in this talk sounds good and I want to believe it but don&#39;t know how much of it is really true.

hahahahahaha

if i&#39;m lonely ??

Towards <a href="">#UnityConsciousness</a>
I listen carefully.

Isn&#39;t this just the placebo affect?

informative!!

Kelly McGonigal&#39;s wise approach to stress is so beautifully shared in this well-loved TEDtalk!Reaching out to others through caring or shared experience does reduce stress and make life more enjoyable!

Great POV. I&#39;m buying! <a href="">#CISM</a>

But what about the people u help the most that’s the people that hurt u and most and stresses u I choose to be alone and take care of my family that’s it am done with people taking advantage of me

A very well spoken analogy with serious implications that are well worth making a life style change.  Thank you.

Kelly McGonigal about a paradigm shift: how to turn stress into an advantage.Change your mindset: see stress as a positive message to DO something about it.

i recommend you to aviod this stress

this is fabulous!!

SHE IS SO CUTE. BEAUTIFUL SPEAKER

Interesting but yeah I agree it&#39;s all in the mind.

Awesome!!!

deel 1 <a href="">1:35</a> - <a href="">3:23</a>deel 2 <a href="">5:21</a> - <a href="">7:00</a>deel 3 <a href="">7:30</a> - <a href="">10:53</a>deel 4 <a href="">11:14</a> - <a href="">13:22</a>
Wait....... so people who deal with stress better than others have a lower likelihood of dying from stress???? How philosophical and mind blowing....... worst ted talks by far.

What if I don’t have anyone to talk to what can I do ,people I talk too end up hating the other person I’m stressing about and then it becomes more stressful

deel 1 <a href="">1:35</a> - <a href="">3:23</a>deel 2 <a href="">5:21</a> - <a href="">7:00</a>deel 3 <a href="">7:30</a> - <a href="">10:53</a>deel 4 <a href="">11:14</a> - <a href="">13:22</a>
It’s very good.

Nice! What will you do next?

This whole speech is placebo pill... smoke and mirrors to get us to &#39;&#39;feel&#39; like she&#39;s said something deep... Least scientific and most dishonest presentation ever... it&#39;s all a big ego-rub for her; look at her smirk when she drops her little &#39;truth bombs&#39; ... like a vampire living off of the audience&#39;s praise and adulation ........and the lack of logic!!: &quot;caring creates resilience&quot;...? completely tangles cause &amp; effect and presumes linearity... and she never once talks about individual differences... news flash: &#39;grit&#39; ONLY works for people who are naturally &#39;gritty&#39;... and mindset ONLY works for people who are cognitive-dominant .....my guess for the new 16th highest cause of death...??  how about: the people who are already stressed to the max, and now, on top of that, will suffer from the added stress of feeling like they&#39;re killing themselves with their &#39;bad&#39; mindset.

worth watching a couple of times a year to remind oneself of the benefits of (positive ) stress -  IMHO connecting with nature , even by means of dog walking , is a great way of rebooting away from a negative stress environment

An eye opener
if only i knew this video sooner kk

Totally agree! I used to find stress as a motivation, and only became negative when faced it as negative!

It&#39;s a good talk, but I would like to get more information about the study. The age of the people who said they had a lot of stress would be interesting.... For example: Students have a lot of stress but are less likely to die than a 60 year old with a lot of stress. If then mostly elderly people believe stress is healthharming, the study would not make any sense.

<a href="">12:12</a> Never forget this key point.

Wonderful. Absolutely fantastic :D

<a href="">7:10</a> helpful reminder

This came just when I needed it

Beautiful Kelly

Stress x34

where can I find the study?

Tell me something I dont know.

My stress response wants me to hit people over the head with a chair.

There are times when a person is in a community where the folks are negative, unsupportive, or neutral.  There may not be many options in the immediate vicinity for a stable support system and you can&#39;t expect people to change in order to have a mutually beneficial relationship. Also we are busy and time is a precious commodity. People can monopolize your time and energy if you don&#39;t have strong boundaries. There are other ways to establish positive relationships, like social media.  Meditation is helpful. Better yet is to move to better pastures.  Sometimes I wonder how often these speakers practice what they preach.  I will find other ways to move around my neurochemicals.  :)

now the only thing needed to find out is wether the people who see stress as something positive do so because of physiological reasons, a healthy chemical balance in the brain or based interely on positive thinking.

this is the longgest TED i ever heard

That was such an excellent response to the question at the end.

Finally got around to her book. Clear book, lots of useful information. Interesting points about meditation and mindfulness. Such books inspire and motivate to create content) Thank you =)
ummm... what about HAIRLOSS? I dont care about living a long life, I care about losing my hair X_X

articles on stress from Holistic Online...great, extensive and comprehensive website, from an MD with interest in natural medicine...<a href="">

It is not true only with the stress but also all the sides of every problems in the whole life

People who experience stress increase their chances of death by 30%. However, it does not apply to all people. Those who experience stress and do so while helping other people, that probability is zero, and not only is it zero but it makes you a resistant and resilient person. At the same time you are invoking a statement that demonstrates "what you are capable of doing." Interesting TED talk.
Jajaja, the Social Stress Experiment sounds like a doctoral exam!!

It&#39;s basically about &quot;what you think is what you get&quot;

This is very helpful kelly!

Lol thought the title said:“How to stress your friend.”

YES  SOME  STRESS IS  NEEDED  FOR  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  BRAIN.

Please excuse my Japanese. I am commenting after working for 15 hours. Compared to when I was working 12 hours a day at a slightly black company and feeling devastated because of my broken home, now that I have a fulfilling job, I don't feel as much pain. There is some physical fatigue. Nowadays, when I sleep well, eat well, work hard and face challenges, I feel like stress is a misunderstanding. After all, stress doesn't actually kill you.
Good vid!

I think you just saved my life

anybody else thinking about bending her over

OMG... SHE&#39;S AMAAAAZINGGGGG

Don’t worry she will be back next year saying new studies reveal stress is a killer LMFAO

Love!

Holy crap i am so healthy right now!
Does anyone know where I can find the studies that Kelly mentioned in the video?

Everytime I’m stressed I eat a @chillaxgummies Ever since I found them they have been a lifesaver hope I can help someone who needs help:)

I&#39;m wondering whether this is part of the reason women outlive men. That human/social connection makes a huge difference.

After watching this, would love to be in stress 24x7 

Woooow! What an amazing perspective about stress. It opened my eyes. All the while we believed in stress-prevention/Anxiety avoidance rather than facing stress and understanding ourselves through it. Thanks a ton for this highly insightful talk.

Absolutely amazing!

Every video on stress, depression, mental pain, happiness finally narrows down to one thing - Good Relationship with your Parents, Friends, Colleagues.

Really helpful and inspiring
The thing that really kills you is a feeling of helplessness and victimization. If you regard yourself as a victim with no power to protect yourself you cause yourself all manner of problems, but if you channel your concern into positive action you&#39;ll do much better.

She forgot to mention the hormone called cortisol when you’re stressed and that’s the bad hormone that can kill you.But she is right it’s how you respond to the stress that’s important.

What about the people for whom nobody cares about?

How can you become a speaker at TedTalks?

it&#39;s good to be narvous that&#39;s make you focus - Carrie Matheson-

Thank you Truly! I have been very stressed and after listening to this and writing this as well as accepting it as a true because i know you become what you think about i already feel better  weight has been lifted off ... THANK YOU going to share this and change how i deal with stress completely ......and yes i do believe this is life saving

you always analyze things....just listen osho or read it....you don&#39;t need these types of technical analysis of stress.... meditation is best answer

everyone is like &quot;oh shes so pretty!!&quot; why don&#39;t we talk about her presentation skills. shes an amazing presentor and speaker, and we should respect that.

Love this

Her voice makes me anxious
BSC Hype

You have mentioned about the importance of sleep for improving willpower in one of your videos ( I don&#39;t know if here also). So my question is  whether it is necessary to have sleep of more than 6 hours at night, or having sleep spans of 4.5 hours at night and 1.5 hours during the daytime will also be OK for the brain.

I love this.....absolutely love this. I deal with panic attacks all the time. You&#39;ve just changed the way I look at it and I can already feel a weight lifted. Thank you.

Hi, from KrushWorks!

She said: But... and I know you were expecting a but - I know. Someone like me thought of this version: Butt...and I know you were expecting a butt - I know.Now watch it again <a href="">11:40</a>.

For some reason, Kelly really reminds me of Tilda Swinton)

The talk is encouraging but the cause and effect relationship is not so clear (maybe there are some evidences the speaker did not mention). For example, people who could afford to care for the others naturally are at a better position of staying alive. People who are healthy are less likely to report that something is bad for their health.

I love you for this cause lately I was going through this situation and glad to know this, thank you, I really want to learn more on this subject.

When we think negatively we get stressed when we think positively we don&#39;t.. &quot;Stress&quot; is our primitive way of dealing real danger. There are no real danger in the modern world.

I agree with the fact that when u are constantly helping others u don&#39;t have stress because I help people and I love it

You are awesome

This is gonna change my life

How does she know what those deceased people believed????she is full of  regarding that.

Why don&#39;t you try this to remove stress --&gt;   <a href="">

Easy to hear~
Wow! Thanks for sharing this!

Woah..

i am a person with C-PTSD... And this didn&#39;t worked for me... help me...

good

she has  that ability of manipulating the Brain,Stop watching the video :D.

This is AMAZING. I have no idea why it has 1k thumb downs.

Stress is important but also unimportant at the same time. Motivational quotes for sale here - <a href=""> (:

Right now it changed my life,I hope it effect rest of my life

Very interesting idea however...correlation is not necessarily causation.  Their are most likely and probably other factors involved that are not being considered.  Their also seems to be the assumption that one can just write off the stress as good for all triggers. Doing so could require insane amounts of positivity and deliberate ignorance.  Also a feeling of having control of what triggers the stress.  Like imagine someone is being bullied or stressed in a job they hate with no clear path to some better job. How do you get someone to see their stress reaction to these things as positive? Also sometimes ones stress reaction has a fight/flight/freeze purpose which means it is telling the stimulus is a danger and frequently it is. Or sometimes the symptom is brought on by not clear reason.  Which can cause one to have a lack of control which studies have also shown to be hazardous.

So nice and amazing presentation. ..

I think that adopting this approach on stress will change too many things in my life... Tedx and Kelly McGonigal thanks!

Wow amazing I love it.

Thanks for Indonesian subtitle. Thank you for the Indonesian translation
why is she saying &#39;body&#39; so weirdly

this all told Jesus Christ about 2015 years ago .

Her presentation was great except she needs to fix her microphone.

wonderful response !
First, i like her voice.
Arm yourself with a positive, inquisitive outlook and anything and everything in life becomes a learning experience with potential benefits

Being smart is Sexy  That&#39;s why I love TedTalks

<a href="">5:22</a>

Wow!! It so interesting! I am doing now rese3arch about stress-management, stress, its&#39;influence on us, and here is sooo great information, which transforms my imagination about stress!

Did anyone else realize this is basically what Kaneki had to do in Tokyo Ghoul when he was being tortured, except he was counting 1000-7 and etc.

Let me ask you - How do you think soldiers, doctors, ppl who live in poverty, through wars etc live to old age? You dont need researches to find out about that.The problem is reliance on researches, and believing ppl say in the name of science

My eyelashes taste like bread.
Amazing
what you think about life matters

&quot;Caring (others) created resilience&quot; - Kelly McGonigal. <a href="">11:45</a>That&#39;s the core. It&#39;s like the scientific approach on bodhicitta. Absolutly wonderful!

So at the end of the day it&#39;s stress is still bad but here is how to deal with it

Wonderful thoughts

This may have just changed my life:).

What about people with communicative disorders such as Asperger&#39;s syndrome and autism? They&#39;re naturally less likely to seek out help in any case. Sadly, the figures show just this. People with these disorders have a much reduced life expectancy... Well, I have Asperger&#39;s so I guess I&#39;m out then. Have a lot of fun in my place, people!

Beautiful.

This Talk has a huge worth. I somehow always feel stressed (doing a lot of things and working on being all self employed) - even though I enjoy what I do. This in my mind is even more bad because everybody is telling you that it is not healthy on the long term (obviously) and so on leads to more stress as I cannot cast it away. Being grateful for the Stress the body provides makes perfect sense and as mentioned the body calms down through that. I&#39;ll try :)

Thanks for helping me making this short motivational movie about stress <a href="">

I saw the video... Was very impressed but it didn&#39;t feel right... So thought about it a couple of days introspected, retrospected,  observed &amp; thought some more... &amp; Came to a conclusion that too much stress just hurts... It makes you susceptible to anxiety &amp; many other mental illnesses which is a greater scourge in itself ... I think stress hurts before you even give it a name!!

Very, very, very good !!! Thank you Kelly McGonigal.

Damn this was good

Wonderful
The overall result of the new study is still that stress is a killer and disease facilitator. This new study actually supports the older studies. It just expands them to include stressful thoughts about stress itself. Stress is the condition when your heart beat and pressure increases when you have an anxiety creating situation or thoughts. Dying of stress becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because it creates anxiety of itself thus amplifying the effects of your stress. I.e, the stress of knowing you are stressed. So the solution: don’t think of stress anxiously. Think of it positively. This cancels it out. But the stress of other things going on in your life continues. For that, we can do the same thing. Think of everything that happens positively or non-judgmentally. This way we reduce anxiety and stress of everyday events. Namaste

Have you seen Room 2&#39;s latest video? Think you&#39;ll like it!

Amazing...really good...

The talk was pretty good ,excess oxytocin is for heart but it can cause breast and endometrial cancers

Reminds me of the ancient swamp that healed ppl even tho it had dead corpses in it ppl would get healed by it placebo effect is great.

During this whole talk I was just thinking this is level one info. She&#39;s not directly an investigator so she probably doesn&#39;t understand that when using statistics you have to do a lot more research, in many other places and with very different samples of people under many other conditions. You need more information to have an argument with better scientific basis. This is info for merely a thesis, and it&#39;s a good thing but you need very very much more research than a Harvard social exam and a pair of other investigations not very well referenced. She shouldn&#39;t show this as absolutely true for everyone. Even though I liked it and will try applying it.

Salu2 to the entire race that continues to chatter
OMG! Not another positive thinking bullshit.... Studies have proven since Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale, that positive or negative thinking have ZERO to do with results. Give it up!

Such a wonderful video this is!

Pause at <a href="">14:22</a> . You will see the curator sitting in the crowd clapping with everyone else, but he was just on the stage. LOL.

Yes! Stress is just a state of mind that can be embraced positively.

I agree, getting stressed about stress is the killer.  You delivered the message with great humour.  I love this talk.

Doubt.   Tell that to people living in warzones or working 60 hours a week or in medical school programs. High levels of stress lead to over-eating, lack of sleep, and lack of exercise, poor health, hypertension, and inflammatory disease. <a href="#5">#5</a>

I like it

This is why I Love tedtalks that much, very inspiring  :)

brilliant speech thank you. I&#39;ll listen to it twice

For those people who are having difficulty to apply her lesson to your life, the first step comes from you. You have to accept that maybe it is time for you to change and know that change is not easy to do (I&#39;ve been there but I know that everybody is different and some will take longer than others). Another thing is to not question and maybe even ridicule her lesson because it is meant to help you, how is it suppose to help you when all you do is question it or even belittle it? Admit that no one is perfect and know that you will make mistakes throughout life but it is there to teach you a lesson, and for those who expect really high of you, do not think about them, but think about your own health. When you actually encounter the real stress, take a deep breath, clear your mind, then remember what she said that your body is designed to counter stress with your heart pumping blood to send oxygen to your brain, think of your options and how you can deal with it confidently. Have confidence in yourself and always ask help from someone (no matter who it is; teacher, friend, family). Because the worst thing that you&#39;ll be doing for yourself is dimming your chances to progress and improve on your life.

I have three words for the study she bases the Ted Talk on: Omitted variable bias.

Does someone know the studies she uses to do this declarations?

Ms. Kelly you&#39;re the only person who has understood me so well. I wish I could find a friend like you.

thats no brainer

Great talk
This talk helped me a lot in the past several years. I now believe stress is good for me, not only for my healthy but also for my tough mentality！

PROPAGANDA, this is sick...

Sometimes I search for Kelly not just for her wonderful insight into stress and willpower... Sometimes I just search to see her face... And siiiiigh.

I&#39;m more stressed by this video than by any ted talk video before. Oh the irony.

Hot and incredibly stupid. I&#39;m not surprised.

How come oxytocin helps our heart regenerate, even though the heart cells are stable/permanent cells incapable of regeneration?

Raise your hand if you&#39;ve blinked in the past year

I love you Kelly McGonigal for this talk..... u have increased my life expectancy right now to a whole another level.. thank you

i like her！！！
Gripped to he edge of the seats. Amazing talk.

Thinking stress is good for you took away the fear in you. The fear of death, of doing something harmful to your body. All comes down to your mind tricking your physical body into whats going to happen.

Beautiful!!!!

This is awesome. Never thought with this perspective. I will remember this talk when I encounter stress in life

Lol once she showed 43% I thought i was going to die

A talk that explains very well the quote : &#39;Body achieves what mind believes&#39;. The lady&#39;s voice has so much power.

The &#39;valley girl&#39; speech pattern and the faux cliff-hanger sentences are unbearable.  This woman may be a good researcher but she is a horrible presenter.  Her talk at google was better because it was more engaged with the audience, than a monologue.  But this is just horrid.

Cute lady 
is that my man Bill Gates in the audience?

I&#39;m grateful I watched this! helping people and seeking help, giving and receiving, it&#39;s not a sign of weakness, in fact it needs more courage to seek for help . And that&#39;s what stress is all about, it&#39;s and internal alert system that tells you to connect with people.

What about the ones who are not aware of the stress response and its effect on the body? It would be interesting to change the denominator in her statistics. Selecting your sample population from somewhere where not a lot of people are educated and understand all of this. What would the data on stress related cardiovascular disease etc are going to look like? Just a thought!

I dont know why but I got stressed watching this video

Aren&#39;t we all at risk of dying?

I love this intro

What&#39;s 1000 - 7?

Nothing new...what it meant was stress is ok, accept it as a part of your life.

love it

I also take stress positively. I'm still able to deal with stress though.
if anyone has 400K in the bank, &quot;what stress&quot;   old man mike

Isn&#39;t it odd that TED disabled comments on Kelli Drinkwater&#39;s presentation?

The coherent way she talks and the calm vibe she gives in front of such large crowd of people in an obviously stressful situation shows her method works

But stress gives me nausea and sometimes diarrhea . . What to do about that?

The only thing we have to fear is the fear of stress itself

next time I get my bills I am going to apply her reasoning :)

1. Look at stress a positive mechanism that you body gives to you. I felt like only when i heard that i was feeling already 30% better. 2. It naturally carries a cure within it for recovering from long term damage, recognise and act upon it. 3. That elements is pushing you to create meaning for relationship. Most likely showing the weak side of you gets you friends quick. (Sadly it is sometimes a power game in building a relationship. So being underdogs gets your people...) 4. Key point, be honest to your self, acknowledge and appreciate yourself. / Above are only my take home points.

Wow! He asked a very good question and got a great response. That was a perfect wrap up for this talk.

I like the way, how she say baaady

I&#39;ve watched several videos of Kelly McGonigal speaking and I find that she is speaking about practices which Buddhism teaches. However, she speaks about it in a scientific presentation. Mindfulness of how you function with your daily routine. Human connection to others through stress. Caring creates resilience. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning with connecting with others. Chasing meaning is better for your health rather than avoid discomfort. Kelly McGonigal is a brilliant woman. She is very articulate.

I had stress related problem for past years , but after watching this video I understand that I am not stressed but I&#39;m blessed . god bless you.

them red pants lowered my cortisol levels instantly .

Prophet Mohammed Said this 1400 hundreds ago The Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, believed: “Whoever is pleased that his livelihood will be expanded for him and that his trail be traced back to him, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” His meaning is: his lifespan will be delayed and his lifespan will be increased, “upholding ties of kinship, good character, and good conduct.” Neighborhood, they inhabit their homes and increase their lives.”
is it belief that stress is good for you that reduces risk of death or is the fact that the people who believe that are more positive and optimistic in general?

Lovely Video clip! Excuse me for butting in, I am interested in your thoughts. Have you thought about - Riddleagan Professional Beats Remedy (do a search on google)? It is an awesome one of a kind guide for discovering a 7 minute mind power method for living your best life without the headache. Ive heard some interesting things about it and my m8 after a lifetime of fighting got cool success with it.

&quot;Good stuff!&quot;
Thank you so very much.

Thank you

Great way to reframe stress !

harry potter anyone?

please take a few minutes to view this Tedtalk. Have a good day my friends.

STRESS=S-ensing T-rue R-elaxing E-xperience S-timulate S-tresslessnessSTRESS=S-ometimes T-he R-eality E-xperience(is) S-imply S-tressful.I know it might sound stupid ,the thing about chasing meaning is better than avoiding discomfort.Yet I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m clear about what I&#39;v just written-meaning the acronyms.generally I&#39;m good at writing acronyms ,now I feel that I blew it.shortly ,Kelly is adorable and impressive woman!!!

god bless you madame , this actually helped me <b>a lot</b>

All she said here coincides with my own research! Stress not only destroys the immune system, but alters your perception to such an extend, that it makes its expansion a self-fulfilling prophecy.

and when stress avoids you to get an erection, how can you take it as a positive aspect ? how can you vope with that to have your erection ?

&quot;This is my body helping me rise to this challenge&quot; - Kelly McGonigal

It could also be that people who view stress as good for them are actually dealing with less stress in their lives. If you&#39;re unemployed and can&#39;t afford your rent, you&#39;re not going to answer the survey with &quot;yeah stress is great for me&quot; as you&#39;re in a stupor of panic and anxiety.

Thanks , This is a very positive presentation ....

Voila! Hit liked at 6.50. energized before completion.

How you think about things effects every relationship and every cell in your body...which begs the question...why don&#39;t we more thought to what we think?

If research telling believing stress is harmful would be true (or well made) every medical research would have to be made again. Basically she tells believing something can kill u actually kills u, this means that nocebo/placebo effect would be so big that can even kill u, that means that we don&#39;t need drugs anymore.Btw talking seriously i think she confused and mixed up eu-stress and di-stress.

super talk... really helpful

this has honestly been the most helpful piece of advice that I&#39;ve ever heard and it has helped me tremendously! I bet similar strategies could also be applied to things like loneliness, anger, sadness, etc.

I&#39;d stressed out nearly 30% of my body. But this might help thanks to Kelly!

Of course she&#39;s amazing, she&#39;s a McGonigal.

&quot;This is my body helping me rise to this challenge.&quot; Nailed it.

So if alcohol makes me more social, in return equals less stress by hanging out with people. Alcohol is helping me live longer

Absolutely agree!!! I noticed that thing a few years ago, kind of if you take stress as a learning experience - you become better (same as physical training stress), so happy to hear it is not only belief but there is scientific base for it :)

This is THE best TED talk ever.

You gotta be kidding me. i actually feel pain and get craps randomly all over when im stressed and all because that&#39;s what ive been told?? My mind is blown. I hate my doctors, buncha pill pushing druglords full of misinformation. &quot;oh this pill isn&#39;t working? here lets up the dose and give you 10 others then maybe one will work if your kidneys havn&#39;t failed by then    Amazing fucking video, i needed to see this, i know watching this is going to help

Her grandmother used to teach Transfiguration at Hogwarts.

I don&#39;t know if this reasoning makes sense. Maybe the people who said they didn&#39;t see stress as harmful, just didn&#39;t actually experience that much stress. Maybe they had a different idea of what &#39;stress&#39; means.

How reliable is the evidence given, though? She is saying that those with bad outlooks on stress die sooner as a result of that negative perspective. But could it be instead that people who are struggling to live in the first place (say due to diseases or suicidal situations) would be stressing in a more negative way? Then it may be misleading evidence as perhaps it is not the outlook which is the cause death, but rather a worse situation (perhaps entangled with death/survival) which often happens to bring on a more negative form of stress. It&#39;s not that I believe negative stress doesn&#39;t have negative affects, I&#39;m just saying that the thought of changing your outlook on stress may not have such exaggerated effects as significantly increasing your life span. Thoughts anyone?

Awesome video, very much helpful.

Who watching during finals haha

I will think of this talk for my important exam tomorrow, wish me luck!

or is it how to stress your friend

it&#39;s a man&#39;s dismal state from India that we know but learn from West leave alone talk of it when yoga and meditation have gone there from here , what should shame feel?

Its &quot;Stress&quot;, NOT &quot;Strass&quot;, hearing the main word in this Video that way spoken by a professional makes me wonder...

Very good, but all of these findings are already present in Christianity for thousands of years but modern society forgot about it. Mankind walked away from God and is now working hard through the science to find Him again, when we should just look back into the Bible and make our lives simple and healthy again.

remove stress with toys :Dand help me :) plss<a href="">

God, I understand every word, why can&#39;t people talk the same way in movies and serials?

Well damn spot on
We know that stress causes different diseases and decreases our life expentancy. But this study tells us that stress is harmful for you if you think of it as an enemy. People experiencing a lot of stress but don&#39;t consider it as a threat are actually more healthy than people experiencing low stress but considet it as a threat. By changing our mind about stress we can change our body&#39;s response to stress and it can make you healthier.

awesome. this was an eye opener.

Hi..

your so strong, thank you very much for learning me something new, I needed that so much

Wonderful
Unfortunately in an attempt to atone for her past misconceptions, she&#39;s now proselytizing a very simplistic story that is alas lies-to-children. The real picture with stress is alas more complicated. How much intensity and for how long stress acts is crucial in its effects. A little stress turns out to be beneficial to the brain, whereas high-intensity and/or chronic (long duration) has the opposite effect, at least in animal studies <a href=""> Whether high-intensity (potentially PTSD-inducing) or chronic stress can simply be wished away by humans is a dubious hypothesis in view of the animal studies, and I suspect quite unethical to experiment as direct cause/effect (rather than just post-hoc correlations) in humans.

Thank you, It validates the way I have been teaching my clients to react to stress.

&quot;Caring creates resilience&quot;

Try a Labrador Retriever for stress relief

Ok... One Problem here: There might be different kinds of stress!

What I really like about this talk is how she admits she was wrong in her thinking before.  That is how we change, admit the problem, and change the process of thinking.  Great talk.

** Deep breath **Thank you :)

Does anyone know the name of the articles she cites? I would like to know more

who did it

what was the study

This talk has suddenly changed my life! Thanks to TED and Kelly McGonigal for this amazing gift!

this was really helpful

if the stress makes your heart stronger, mine must be like a fucking stone

This is one of the best TED Talks I&#39;ve ever watched.

What about when I was taking my final pre-ap English exam? I&#39;m here banging my head and scratching my arm :|

chasing meaning is more advantageous than avoiding discomfort.

stress is my killer !

thank you

TLDR: Do what you feel is right for you and trust yourself to handle the stress that comes with it.

Thank you !

Wow!

Caring created Resilience. When we are experiencing stress in our life, the belief that stress is harmful for our body made more harm than good. If you change your mind about stress, then you can master your body’s response for your well being. Best example is exam tension. Where a typical Indian student can study the whole syllabus within one night before the exam, if he enjoys the subject. But if he thinks that stress as negative response he will be spending the whole night sleepless. One fine way to over come stress is sharing and caring. Sharing reduces the burden and helps us to move ahead. So how you think and act can transform the stress experience.

go after what makes meaning in your life and trust yourself to handle it

I am very stressed now and very happy . Being stressed really changed my life . When i am unhappy, i just get bit stress it is just amazing.

thanks

What a BOGUS study she cites in the beginning...without stating the name of the Study of 30K people or who did the research!! SO Kelly, using shear common sense I want to know the number of people that actually said that stress is not a bad thing after...2 whole decades of nonstop media and science telling us that it is. How many people Kelly. If you&#39;re going to cite a study, at least don&#39;t misinform people on purpose...WHAT A MANIPULATOR, AND YOU COULD BE HURTING PEOPLE BY MISINFORMING THEN, DO YOU REALIZE THAT MISSY??!!

this is not science, it is entertrainement.

Thank you TED Talks

&quot;this is my body helping me rise over this challenge&quot;

This must be why religious people, who are trained to resolve stress (e.g Buddhist), live longer.

There is no god but God alone, with no partner. To Him belongs dominion and praise, and He is capable of all things
I dunno, this is stressing me out.  I&#39;m doing stress wrong!!

Her mind would explode in a fire house!

Great talk!! ``As thou hast believed so shall it be done on to you`` (Matt <a href="">8:13</a>).However the lesson everyone should learn from this video is the fact that conventional health `Experts`, especially BIG PHARMA `Experts`,  can spend years and years telling us one thing, and then all of a sudden change their minds about it and admit that they were WRONG!!

chasing meaning is better than trying to avoid discomfort.

I needed to hear this cause I was too stressed about school

So basically, live life like you&#39;re playing Dark Souls

Did anyone else stand up. God this is amazing 

I feel quite confused with the second intervention -&quot;Stress makes you social&quot;. As mentioned, the most important bridge between stress and social is Oxytocin. However, it seems that it is social activities (getting help from others or offering help to others) that help release oxytocin, which can lead to physical benefits that make stress less harmful. This is totally opposite to &quot;Stress makes you social&quot;. Right?

Nice

Green eyes :D
Best way to manage stress

this was so nice 

the lady is excellent.

so.. denial works?
This lady changed my life I wanna give her a hug.A naked hug

thnx alot sister

she is beautiful

this doesnt touch the one part where stress could make you just give up, surrender.... and the way she explains it makes it seem the stress were more short termed than what long terms do

So, being wrong the first time, maybe still? I find this really wanting of any real info other than cherry-picked data to support the hypothesis, like so many TED talks - flattering the comfy audience.

This is our free will and it&#39;s total!!!

wow! 

wow.. thank you soooo much 

thank you
JUST LIKE JESUS HAS COME TO SERVE PEOPLE AND TAUGHT THAT THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT IS TO &quot; SERVE OTHERS AS YOU SERVE YOURSELF&quot; NOW WE UNDERSTAND IT, THAT BY SOCIAL WORK AND CARING FOR OTHERS MAKES YOU LESS STREESED (HAPPY) AND YOU LIVE LONG. GOD BLESS YOU!!
JUST LIKE JESUS CAME TO SERVE, HE ALSO TAUGHT US TO SERVE OTHERS RATHER THAN OURSELVES ( GREATEST COMMANDMENT ). NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT BY DOING SOCIAL WORK WE WOULD BE HAPPY. GOD BLESS YOU!!

Well most of my friends stop talking to me and I study with them 7 hours a day, they tease me so damn bad that I feel suicidal but I won&#39;t. Please help me.

She deserved the big round of applause. Brilliant!

here&#39;s a link to the first study she referred to: <a href="">

Amazing video. Wow.
I just got approval to keep doing my homework last second. When I get my Bachelors I&#39;ll thank her!

Really not helpful...Stress too overwhelming

I&#39;ll have to review this vs. the research of dr. Sopolsky. He is a professor at Stanford, with a documentary called... Stress: the Portrait of a Killer. He is an old dude with beard and long hair, your typical biologist. Psychology hmmm is a difficulty science, as in difficult to proof something. As many point out there can be flaws in the way you interpret data. Personally I think anybody who quotes scientific research should also provide the statistical basis and experiment setup. Else it can be a very dangerous road to &quot;truth&quot; akin to religious dogmas.

she rambles on so much i doubt i will buy her book as it will ramble on but she has so good ideas on addiction i think i will just go and read the sutras ror something

I&#39;ve watched this in the past but I was scrolling through ted videos and just realised how incredibly photogenic that thumbnail picture looks. Whoever took that photo is doing a damn good job. Yes I am aware she is already very attractive.

excellent ! Always look for how a situation can train you to make you stronger. However I am not enough to lean on to &quot;trust&quot; but God Almighty the Creator is. I really enjoyed hearing this theory. It encouraged me in my current challenges.

Couldn&#39;t the cardiovascular profile discussed at <a href="">6:18</a> be gained by exercise?

If you believe &quot;stress is your body helping you rise to a challenge&quot;, the flipside is when faced with an unstressful challenge, you´re also believing your body is not helping you.

there's something to be said about beilievese
The people who believe stress is bad for them, are correct. But, it really isn&#39;t good for anyone.  You could have summarized this talk by saying &quot;Some people can handle more stress, with less side effects than others.&quot;  Socializing is not the cure-all for stress related health issues.  Social interactions are the direct cause of a lot of stress people encounter.  I find dealing with people to be a huge source of stress, and really don&#39;t get much comfort from friends and family.  Heart attack; it&#39;s only a matter of time.

This is one of the best videos I&#39;ve seen. :)

leave everything else behind because she is pretty.

a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances. I&#39;m still trying to figure out how to deal with stress, emotional pain or even disappointments. Indeed, such things are inevitable and the only way to deal with it is to embrace it, accept and acknowledge that they will always be part of our lives. By learning and determining how these things come and enter to our lives, we actually allow our mind to completely understand how such negative things like these affect our daily lives and our current situation. We actually learn how to deal with them in more clever ways when we try to recognize and analyze how it affects our lives and by understanding it they are becoming a bit bearable and not really hard to deal with.     I need to practice organizing thoughts and ideas.

well it all comes down to ego problems if you ask me,if i feel like stress translates to me being an insufficiently functioning human beeing ill beat myself up probably developing depressionif i feel stress but dont &quot;take it personal&quot; so to speak, meaning not questioning my very beeing in all its facets just because someone may judge me, ill be just finei think the first view results in setting a goal to become someone else (hence an unachievable/idealistic goal) if you fail or feel like failing or performing insufficiently while the second view will lead to setting a specific goal like maybe working on presentation skills which may then be achieved or not but it wont shatter ones ego if the latter is truein my opinion i think thats why you see depression developing when one experiences cryisis in both work and family environment, with both environments wearing your ego down whats left to pull it back up? You can certainly go and try to distach your ego completely from real life but that again would be an idealistic unachievable goal, unless you start feeling superior because you feel more &quot;spiritual&quot; than the rest of the world it wont do anything for your ego - hence not solving the problem at all.In this sense caring creates ego drawn from human interaction reassuring yourself that youre still functioning, still fitting in, beeing yourself is good.so according to my logic what she really says is: &quot;dont panic, your normal, your fine, your functioning, no need to become someone else&quot; which helps as you dont try to surpress natural body reactions - which are not something you can control with your consciousness - hence not setting an idealistic goal and becoming more insecure and more stressed until you feel like you are in a life threatening situation and your very exsistence rather than the skills required for the performance are questioned.could it be this simple: stress experienced while feeling life-threatened is unhealthyjust ask yourself what stress feels to you: a) performing a tough, challanging, high workload task while beeing assessedb) being put on the spot with no way out, life or death, all or nothing

Amazing?  Here is Ms McGonical admitting to a &#39;decade&#39; of causing serious psychological damage because of a clearly ill researched and faddish approach. Why should we trust her latest interpretation of the &#39;stress response&#39;. Just how robust are the studies that Ms McGonical refers to?  Are they more reliable than those upon which she based  ten year’s worth of bad advice about dealing with stress?

Ms

In a previous job, I stayed for 10 years because I can give priority to my family commitments than the stress fed to us on daily basis. However, two colleagues jumped out windows during those 10 years. We endure pain for our loved ones, and I seriously doubt hormones are involved.. Note: I did get a heart attack though, lol, what a wonderful place.

Great talk, thanks!! <a href="">12:00</a>

stress is so good maybe I should get more stress. but what if a new study just come along with different results, pls keep me informed in that case.

Hilarious, I&#39;ve never seen so many men in one room before, hahaha! I love this girl makes perfect sense to me. I&#39;ve been killing myself believing that the stress that I used for motivation was makin me tired and sick. I was trying to force myself to not stress out because of my fear of it! Wow this is such a new concept to me. It&#39;s so true that your body believes what you feed it mentally and physically. I&#39;m surprised they are just now putting this together. I&#39;d love to get her book.... Thank you whoever you r that shared this! 

This was awesome, thank you!

Mcgonagall is here!

She&#39;s the best!!

I actually really enjoyed this talk. I think the reason why there are so many people commenting that they felt otherwise is she really didn&#39;t give much practical advise on how to realistically view stress as a positive thing which threw me off at first as well. The average person is thinking ok the bills are over my head, my job is aweful evem though I work 80 hours a week etc etc. But I see it like of you can look at your problems in a positive light as a chance to grow and improve like for example say ok i have alot of debt and I have problems spending well then maybe I really need to learn to budget better. Or maybe I need to find a new job or develop a different attitude toward these things. In the case of something bad happening that we can not control like losing someone we love she did suggest that the more we are involved with other relationships and helping others the more we would be able to recover from something like that.

I&#39;m curious now whether being stressed and NOT having supportive community has a different impact than being stressed and having that community.

Wow no comment 
What is the study called that she is referring too in the begning?

Hey guys, heard about that you can make war to a friend? Just imagine how it was there without our foreign aid. It would be a mess. Just think about that. We can create some peace there! And also think of oil and all the goods we get from there, without this, our life would be so much tougher - almost unthinkable. Bullshit.

Very good; very helpful; thank you. For the &#39;mind over matter&#39; crowd, the science makes perfect sense.

She&#39;s not mentioning how oxytocin reduces outgroup trust. Which makes total sense for certain stresses.

friendship :)
Now I&#39;m stressed about figuring out how to greet my stress with joy and courage.

Does this work for people believe that stress prevents gray hairs?  lol

Using one scientific study to make rules about approaching stress, is kind of idiosyncratic - in a bad way. It sounds too good to be true.

Is she related to Minerva?

I want to hug her! :D

This woman is full of it. &#39;Science&#39; tells us =One study.Plus the idea that stress is the fault of those undergoing it - &#39;you&#39;ve not made stress your friend&#39; is pernicious.

Great presentation Kelly!!  Studies prove selfless social giving is the greatest killer of stress.  About a month into disaster volunteering in hurricane Sandy 4 years ago, I came to a point where felt that I had lost the ability to feel anxiety (and anger, fear and envy), and it&#39;s proven to be 100% true and I give thanks largely to the social giving.  I call it <a href="">#VoluntaryHappiness</a>.  I&#39;ve seen this in other disasters as well.  I hope / plan to highlight such findings as yours on a new TV show about disaster volunteerism, The Real Volunteers (TRV).  Thank you for your work!

What she&#39;s really talking about at the end is discernment, a theological weighing of the positives and negatives and figuring out where are you &#39;called&#39;?  Yes, what gives meaning even in a job choice.  If you are called and its a vocation, then there really is no stress per se!

stress makes someone social (y)

what an interesting and hopeful speech...!!

I&#39;m sure that stress can kill you.I had that much stress before my examination, that black patches appeared on my skin and they started falling off and i was bleeding. It tuned out it was because of an autoimmune disease caused by stress. I got a ointment from a dermatologist. It stopped the bleeding quickly. When i passed the exam with a good grade and i took a week off and go hiking, all my symptoms where gone. Stress in education is a serial killer. At that time i was alone and no one could help me understand the studies i was learning. I had the confidence and i was feeling challenged and encouraged by the fact i&#39;m gonna earn so much respect and money if i can do this exam. Since that happened i still try avoiding stress, but i cannot. And last year i had a small tumor in my thyroid. So i&#39;m pretty sure stress can kill you.Now i try to think of stress in a different way. It cost not that much to try out think differently - maybe it will help me.

Hmmm.... not sure I&#39;m in agreement here.Of course having a stimulating job and handling the stress involved BETTER - would be good.But stressing over your ability to keep your staff employed, your family fed and avoiding bankruptcy is very different.I know young people who absolutely destroyed their health with irresponsible financial decisions, and the stress involved.Yes, pursue a stimulating career - but NO, don&#39;t think that stress in general is good for you.

,,182,000 Americans died prematurely,not from stress but from believe that stress is bad for you&quot;-how can they know that if it was fault of stress?Let me argument same way as she did.Every person who ever was drink water later died.So this is fault of water,end story dont care about other factors.

At what point was this ever a breakthrough? I figured this was obvious, we&#39;ve always known this. When you think badly, we have always known it can have negative effects. :/

greaaaaat .
Wonderful insights!  Helpful as I face a situation with a wife who&#39;s memory is slipping,  Fear of the future grips me but makes me want to be more caring and less inclined to say, &quot;but I told you already&quot; OR &quot;don&#39;t you remember&quot;.  My wonderful wife of over 49 years has been in the UK for nearly a month and will be back on Monday and so I am driving up to Perth to meet her, rest with her for a day before returning.  I have kept in touch on Skype almost daily to help me cope with &quot;change&quot;.

can anybody tell me where can I find the scientific studies that she mentioned in her speech? Are the studies real?

can anybody tell me where can I find the scientific studies that she mentioned in her speech?

This is my body helping me rise to this challenge

<b>Kelly McGonigal is a quack who misquotes studies to create a false, but attractive narrative.</b>

This is great!

Watched this talk 9 times and I learn something new each time.

amazing
really interesting, I&#39;ll have to remember this before a race next week.

It may help my friend from PD

What kinda accent is that? Its not the typical general American accent.  When she said &quot;about it&quot;, it sounds a bit like a Southern accent?  English is my second language.  So i&#39;m genuinely interested.  Thanks.

Thanks you very much for this. I think this is the best advice on stress, which can help a lot of people not living miserably.

Seems like two different theories to me... I have seen guided imagery to calm anxiety which says positive imagination can calm down anxiety, but here its stated that making stress a friend. If I had public speaking anxiety and I make stress a friend wouldn&#39;t it make my speech more difficult?or wont it make the stress more and more frequent during every presentation? please someone explain simply if you understand.

THIS open my mind, LOVE IT!!!!
Its so true that she saysi love it

amazing
wow that talk just spoke to me, especially the last part of her reply to the emcee&#39;s question. Thanks so much for sharing this!!!

Amazing!
I&#39;ve found great handbook on InpliX website. Great solutions for everyone I think

I need to do research it feels like she just Disneyfied stress. It would seem to me that stress has positive and detrimental effects but lifestyle and mindset determine the effects. 

A phase in the video might seem like a puppy-eyed, redundant and over-stressing of limited sentences or thoughts. But listen to it again because each and every time you replay, those sentences get apart from each other as much as possible and deliver unique ideas at bull&#39;s eye.

very good.

do you think this mindset would also work for anxiety? not clincal anxiety disorder just feeling anxious, stress and anxiety are pretty similar

Some people even have higher level of stress than is normal. I wonder if just making  stress our friend and socializing can be any major help for people with high level of stress and anxiety.

Such a good talk!

it&#39;s  amazing. ..the same fight or flight response that are suppose to help us make us scared because we don&#39;t know how to handle  them...it&#39;s the same reaction in animals when they&#39;re in fight to flight mode they hunt and run as that&#39;s the way the body response to it.....really great lecture

I only watched very first bit until she said stress only kills IF you believe it&#39;s harmful to your health. Derr: maybe, just maybe, the people who were ill/dying KNEW they were ill/dying and that caused the stress?Surely she can&#39;t believe it&#39;s as simple as she tries to make out? A test, a joke? Maybe more explained later but I can&#39;t be bothered - and find her voice terrible to listen to.If her story at start is true (she&#39;s changed her mind) maybe it&#39;s because her mind/body/life/situation have been changed?Depends what you mean by stress: as a self-employed graphic designer I thrived on a bit of stress and deadlines. Since my brain injury deadlines are still useful but I work SO slow now and sometimes just CAN&#39;T do much at all whereas before (pre-bungled op) I could and did push myself far harder but it was much much easier.I know we all cope with stress in all its many varieties differently, what is stress to one is not to another, often depends if we CAN complete the tasks or whether they are truly beyond us. For example: to ask someone who struggles at maths to do a whole day of complex equations and get mostly correct answers or else they won&#39;t eat that day would create terrible stress.Having not enough money for even a BASIC life is an enormous stress that DOES kill - proved (I think). Not getting healthcare/prevention KILLS in many different ways. Bad housing and having no CHOICE over where you live and lack of security creates ENORMOUS stress - which I&#39;m SURE can kill. It certainly feels like that to me and lack of sleep, raised blood pressure, falls, dampness cause illness and injury. Plus disabled people (poorer than average) including those with invisible injuries/disabilities are more often poor, in bad housing, eat bad food and have shorter life expectancies. All these stressors are not healthy, sorry, I&#39;m stating the blindingly obvious.REAL stress is VERY different from &#39;healthy&#39; stress. I truly hope this woman explains more clearly later and STRESSES the difference. Has she ever experienced poverty, living in short-term rented housing, had to eat (and get ill from) food bank food (no fresh fruit/veg)? If not she cannot hold herself out to be an expert on stress. Point. Stop.

one of the best ted talks till now (Y)

I came for Pugli
Took her 10 years to find this out !..

Can anyone tell me what is the main idea of  this video?

I need to try this...

say hi and mention Harry potter and Tom riddle kinda being the same guy in real life if only the author had a life before right

Well, im gonna die early.
I&#39;ve started listening to a horror music when i work :D

She&#39;s so fake.

WAIT, so for the last study, if there&#39;s no increase of the rate for dying with those who cared for others in stress, then that doesn&#39;t support the point she made earlier about helping others in stress will help your own health. It simply breaks even??

Kelly McGonigal is a combination of beauty with brains

so cool
Wow, all the doctors and scientists have got it wrong, this psychologist understands physiology and endocrinology (hormones) better than all of them. And she only used a survey-based study and some creative confusion of correlation and causation to get there! Give the woman a medal.

like her, she is not pretty, but attractive, if i was single, i would marry her immediatly.

Thank you Kelly  : )

I want to marry Her. She Is Perfect ️

Watched it twice.  Informational and inspiring.

YEYEYEYEYE I just made stress my friend boyzzzzzzzzz. I used to be like really hostile to stress but now I have to hang out with em like 3 tiems  a day yulay.

If u like dis
God she is so hot

Is there a link for the mentioned studies?

stress our friend smiles at life......
Kelly rules! Life is stressful. It just comes with breathing. So make it a friend.

This is amazing! When I&#39;m really stressed before an exam I often have to find friends to give me hug! Now I get why!

NOW THAT you watched this, watch OUTWITTING THE DEVIL.  It&#39;s an interview with the devil.  It&#39;s an audiobook.  Find the one with the interview only.

She is a hottie, ain&#39;t she...

<a href="">4:07</a> dat bill gates?
Wow. Thank you!! I needed this

I love TED talks!
The devil is trying to destroy the future and the present with the past. Why do people keep saying wake up? It is because they are trying to bring you into the present moment. The truth shows what has been hidden from us right in front of our faces. Google truth contest and read the present this is truth you can check yourself. Nobody wants to know the truth because they dont want their illusions destroyed. 

I honestly don&#39;t believe most of this talk.

Cracks finger, 1000-7 KANEEEEEEEEEEEEEKI
Some very good points.

I would marry her

She is hot LOL

To put it plainly, this lady is full of crap pile. Stress is bad! Planning ahead so that you&#39;d avoid stressing out is good.

&quot;Chasing meaning is better than avoiding discomfort.&quot; Most definitely

Interestigng
Interesting

Glory be to God truly and truly always and forever! He created man, and the wisest creation was to place a thing and its opposite in the same place! Thanks to you, god !
for me, to be less stress in life is that you know how to forgive for everything bad :)

I always thought stress was my only friend and turns out I still have to earn it.

Interesting video. I want that this video will change my thinking because at this time no matter what I did it&#39;s become bad.Thank I believe that from tomorrow it will better.

my head ache just disappeared while watching. great video.

Excellent
she´s hot
thank you

meaning full video.. worth watching

All my working life I&#39;ve been telling new mothers oxytocin is good for them and enhances their and their baby&#39;s life even if it does make a mom&#39;s emotions bounce around and give her cramps. Looks like I did do something right after all.

I think this video is very helpful for people who experience a lot of stress , to make them happier and healthier when dealing with stress. I was shocked learning about the causes of death  that weren&#39;t stress related .

When talking about harmful effects of stress, it&#39;s important to realize that it is the <b>physiological response</b> of an organism that matters, not some description of an event. Kelly suggested a method for reducing that response. This doesn&#39;t contradict the idea that too much of stress (chronic stress, most of all) is harmful.

Really an &quot;Idea Worth Spreading&quot;

These TED talks are getting worse.. So the moral is more stress is a good thing and just deal with it and shut up..

Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki: &quot;Whats 1000 minus 7?&quot;

I wonder if No.5 &quot;accidents&quot; includes, getting shot by someone else?

That Lady is sharp. It feels like she&#39;s on top of her topic all the time. Also liked her fluent presentation skills

So me being in a tuf proffesion is actually going to be no prob by change of mindset! She just changed my whole life :O

that was a beautiful talk.

smoking weed does help to fight for stress sometime,but its not good to make habbit for smoking weed everyday

Very helpful and timely.

EXTRAORDINARY GOOD IF WE PUT IT INTO PRACTICE.
Tip for grass hoppers:Think in a foreign new language, for a cool head, while your drummer boy beat it like Bobby Jarzombek. Also work 110% to avoid having your &quot;boss&quot; tellin you: you&#39;re not my &quot;boss&quot;..

we&#39;ll talk again after your first burn-out. and I mean burn-out, not just a bit of stress.

Love!

Wow, this was awesome!!! Outstanding talk!!!

Love this. Very nicely done Kelly McGonigal!

I definitely needed to hear this.

Friend with pressure

Friend with pressure

This is possibly the most beneficial video I&#39;ve ever watched.

Thanks to have great point. which is useful And productive.....

Someone give this woman an award.

Fantastic talk! Thank you!

great talk ! Mcgonigal is pretty ...

A bit of a feel good-er talk. I expected more than this pep talk.Yes, there is a lot of truth in the believing in something and it will happen. A very good reason to not believe in curses, or witchcraft or other such potentially moronic things.One gets the world they make fore them selves . . . . So make your self a good on folks.

Great! Just apply don&#39;t dissect it :) Stay positive. Autosuggestion. Use this new energy…

am i the only one who hates american slang? they seem to chew their tongue when they talk

this reminded me of the time I was feeling really negative and read that negative ppl have a bigger chance of dying :)

.... &quot;chasing meaning &gt; avoiding discomfort&quot;   (!!!)
What if the effects of stress come from unrealistic fears, things that are not really a threat to us?

This was brilliant and I loved her pronuncuntion of &quot;body&quot;

The video length is <a href="">14:28</a> and the halfway point is <a href="">7:14</a>. 7 , 14 , 28

great speach

Thank you so much, Kelly McGonigal...

bullshit presentation, sounds like a bad school project
Kelly, your talk was amazing. I coped with stress so well as a teen but now without my mum (my major support network) it has been harder to cope over the years. I listened to this on Sunday and it is now Thursday, and i am so much calmer and my heart doesn&#39;t have the familiar ache it usually does at the time of the week. My calmer moments at work have been happier ones when I think back to your talk. Thank you so much. This makes alot of sense to me because Buddha says &quot;with our thoughts we make the world&quot; and this perception of stress stems from the mind. 

Can I marry her?

Very well done! I honestly had no idea prior that stress and oxytocin had anything to do with one another. But she is absolutely  right, it is all internal in your mind and how you interpret stress. If you think about stress in a negative away, your mind and body will display negative effects. But I never saw stress in this positive way. Stress is also for me in a way, a motivator, helps me realize I need to get things done!

So what i do on a daily basis right? Fueling yourself to attack your goals with that stress.

Best 14 minutes I&#39;ve had. Perfect talk I needed in the last year of my PhD! Thanks. xx

the law of attraction

Beautiful, brother :3
Connection to my dog gave me hope and caring about animals and the environment. Humanity is out of question these days.

I was thinking to myself what on earth does this title mean - how to make stress your friend ...uh...makes no sense! it&#39;s probably &#39;how to make your friend stressed&#39; lol Only after watching the video, the title had sunk in. it was very inspirational.

So everything we know is wrong. Great.

simple pickup :)
SOME AMERICANS ARE SO FUCKING ANNOYING

What age group is at more risk for developing stress related health issues? If you just started to relieve stress, like Kelly McGonigal stated, and continued to do so, but lived a very stressful life before; will your body&#39;s brain prevent major health issues like Cardiovascular disease. The video was very informational and can help me in the future at college about a midterm or final exam.

This video has been something that has left a deep impression on me and hopefully, how I deal with stress. I&#39;ve tried to share it with my friends and family and am now sharing it with my blog friends. Thanks so much for this totally different and very positive view of stress!!!

Now, I can clearly explain to people why they never see me look stressed.  A big take away for me is &quot;Finding meaning is better for your health than avoiding discomfort.&quot; Thanks Kelly.

This is an impressive video. It shows a new approach to stress, which could work for me:)

It all make sense now, GEAR SECOND!!!

&quot;Caring Created Resilience&quot; --- that&#39;s powerful!

very unprofessional!!the self proclaimed health psychologist does not even know how to differentiate between correlation and causal relationship. shame

My husband turns stress into Eustress. It gets him going, but in a good way. He sees every problem as a challenge and does he best to overcome the problem. Just so you know, he is seen as a superman at his work!I, on the other hand, turn stress into distress (tho I am getting better). I tend to want to stay in bed and call in sick. I solve nothing and make myself miserable so I certainly can see how it really is a matter of how we think about it.Of course, some of us want our friends and family to feel sorry for us and maybe help us out. But you know what? If you are happy about the work ahead, MORE people will help you.So, let&#39;s all just see stress as a challenge!  ;-)  &lt;3

This works for more things than stress, For example if you would go sporting and you&#39;d believe that you won&#39;t lose weight or gain muscles you won&#39;t gain as fast as if you would think you can do it. Some other study I&#39;ve seen, I really think that your mindset can change your whole life.

I don&#39;t know y everyone in the audience is cracking up about the belief in stress. Science and media have been teaching us for a long time now that stress is very harmful to your body.

thank you, Ms.Kelly.I was diagnosed &quot;anxiety&quot; in the Emergency Room when l during I had been living Los Angeles.I felt like I&#39;m going to die and some breathing problem and paralysis of my arms.I was treated in hospital which in South Korea.I&#39;m taking the medicines since the symptom had appeared. Now,I&#39;m living in Tokyo and studying English more. I let know the your speech to my psychiatrist. She studied New York. She was so interested in your book that translated in Japanese, although I prefer to watch you speech movie clip on the Youtube.She might searched you book or name on Google.I really appreciate that you let me know to how the stress can be affected in positive way to our body. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much and I hope all we be the happy and have GooD stimulus stress and also not so much.Thank you Kelly !! ^_^

exelenttttttt please do one on spanish to help my people

exelenttttttt please do one on spanish to help my people

Hi Kelly and TED for sharing this great and timely subject!She did a wonderful presentation.  Oh My lot of things to make note!Have a great and stress less weeks, months and years ahead! :-)I am a bit late here to check this.Best Regards~ Philip V Ariel, SecunderabadIndia

Chase meaning first and it will be easier to deal with any discomfort that follows

She must be the sister of SuperBetter Jane McGonigal. Wow are they the two super-heroes. It would be interesting to see them together.

this inspired me

Thank you for amping me up for my final Presentational Speaking class! It was really helpful and came onto my screen at the best time. You&#39;re a great speaker, loved watching this!

Hey I just lost $3 billion dollars in the stock market today!!!But hey , no pressure, cause I gave a poor guy 2bucks and did good:)

this is SO BADASS

I need the opposite - people to leave me alone lol. I need distraction-free environment, that gives me a stress relief, instead I do have a ton of people around me who are always trying to &quot;support&quot; me by invading my space...

I love the guy who stood up at the end ^_^

<b>&quot;Trust yourself for the stress that follows.&quot;</b> Preach!

Having God in your life also helps you get through stressful situations, and anything else in your life. He will ALWAYS be there for you.

excellent
i love her !!! absolutely amazing

Thank you, Kelly!  Just more proof that what you think you believe.  What you believe will manifest!  : )

Very enlightening!

this lecture is a gold mine, really an eye opener and all I needed to stop being so helpless with my chronic worries. thank you.

Has there been any kind of study on the oxytocin effects on people&#39;s behavior? I mean, when people get addicted to it, can it make you chase stressful situations like choosing a more jammed way home and start blaming the driver in front of you for driving slowly and stuff like that?

Incredible!
This is SUCH an important message!  Everyone needs to know this!  Can&#39;t wait to read &quot;The Upside of Stress&quot;!

TED Talks are the best.

The whole presentation was so helpful, but the most profound thing was Dr. McGonigal&#39;s response to the question at the end.

Easy to say, but reality is that there are a lot of sociopath to whom you can&#39;t be honest and you end up bottling it up, unable to do something, because there is no true justice in this world.You just have to realize that you are unable to do anything in these situations and accept it and move on.The CEOs in many companies are the people who are willing to step on anyone in order to acquire that position.And if that happens to be your boss then you are pretty much screwed, just accept it.

What doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger                                                                ~~stress and oxitosin

is it just me or she is really hot

Only looked this up because of jre podcast.  Powerful Joe Hogan

wow this was actually amazing

Thanks for this excellent &amp; very useful insight into Stress. I am sure this TED by Kelly has a potential of making a significant difference to the Humanity at large...more particularly for people suffering from Stress!! Thanks Kelly...Thanks TED!! :)

Thank for your shared idea Kelly

<a href="#s8">#s8</a>

Ted talk gay

Best Ted talk of all time

I read her book on stress. It&#39;s a great read. Thanks Kelly.

Thank you do much. This is so useful and being positive :)

This Ted Talk blends the &quot;woo woo&quot; spiritual with the concrete scientific perspective.Indeed, our minds &amp; bodies are tightly connected.  How we use one influences the other.

***** Hey,This isn&#39;t congress,  the thread doesn&#39;t have to &quot;burst in flames&quot; just because people can&#39;t see other people&#39;s point of view or if they do they disagree. Specially through VERY LIMITED information in a youtube thread. People tend to post their opinions based on their own life experiences and that doesn&#39;t mean what each side is saying is less valuable than the other. It just means there is a communication breakdown.***** I quote:&quot;This is a PHD health psychologist with more than a decade of real world experience and pier reviewed research to back her claims that you&#39;re talking about here, not some anonymous internet troll who thinks he knows better. You think people with &quot;love based stress&quot; are the only ones who have sought help from her practice?&quot;Exactly, she&#39;s a PhD with years of experience. At this point she MUST have seen people suffer because of stress. What you&#39;re saying is the equivalent of blaming someone for having polio and then laughing at them because they DIED of it. It doesn&#39;t make sense and most importantly IT DOESN&#39;t make them want to listen to that  message. Is that what you meant? And I&#39;m sure the people that seek her help are NOT the ones that love what they&#39;re doing but the ones that need help because they don&#39;t know what to do with their own stress.What I&#39;m saying is that the message she&#39;s giving could be better delivered. Not that I disagree with it. It&#39;s obvious that she&#39;s trying to help. But you don&#39;t help someone by kicking them when they&#39;re down and making bad jokes about their suffering. Anything else aside, that doesn&#39;t help people want to get up. That&#39;s my point. If you don&#39;t see there&#39;s a possibility that people suffer because of stress and they don&#39;t take such mockery lightly, at least please refrain from disrespecting their point of view and treating them like idiots who don&#39;t know what research is or how it works. Much more importantly, please stop trying to negate and disrespect their OWN experience.

I&#39;ve found this speech very interesting and helpful...much more than lot of Zen Master&#39;s books!

I wish she helped me to get rid of my stress :)

very good,thanks.

she did the tokyo ghoul torture...

This woman is either taking things out of context for misinterpretation or has an agenda:<a href=""> you more of an introvert or an extrovert?Introvert. People who don’t know me well and have only seen me on stage or TV are usually surprised by this, but spend any time around me and you’ll find out how much time I need alone to recharge from teaching, speaking, and social events. When I’m on the road, I tend to stay up late in my hotel room, reading and doing yoga, even if I’m sleep deprived or jet lagged. I need that time to balance the intensity of teaching and speaking.&quot;How do you call yourself a Psychologist and have the nerve to publish this for people with stress to see when you yourself are an example of needing relaxation?I came here because it was recommended to me, what a rut.

i approve this to be true

this video changed my life !!

<a href="">8:36</a> she&#39;s a fucking pro

translate i no
According to this woman&#39;s claim sress could be beneficial if you change your perspective on stress. I disagree with that. Stress has detrimental effect on body, mind and spirit. It lowers your immune system, causes cancer and other chronic diseases. It lowers your mental faculties and you spiritually feel empty and purposeless if you are stressed out regardless of how you associate stress with human well-being.

Wow) Pretty impressive, one more preconception has been destroyed.  And also speaker very smart and attractive girl.  It&#39;s pleasure to watch this )

Its acceptance = less stress, so not resisting it means theres less persistence and you are more healthy. So shes been right all along, but teaching in a way that promotes resistance.Solution: meditate.

The messenger is as beautiful as the message.

So.. if we help other people with the aim of making our selves healthier, are we being selfish?

Caring creates resilience. 

when she said count back from 7 was anyone else reminded of Tokyo Ghoul?

She talks with so much sense i love it 

Turning into a cat might help.

Thanks, TED for a great talk by Kelly McGonigal. Very profound, educational and useful for all of us. Thanks again, TED Talks =).

Thank you for sharing this talk.

why i don&#39;t understand it
A great talk! Thank you Kelly McGonigal! :))

Smart aunt! Thank you! :) just what I need.
It&#39;s that girl from Pitch Perfect

Kindnes makes us healthier :).
ya its true

open mic night, amateur hour
I love this speech and I adore her sister Jane McGonigal who talking  about the meaning of games. They both good.

such a nice lady

If Kelly McGonical is following the comments here, I challenge her to put her money where her ample mouth is by issuing the &quot;FoxConn Challenge&quot;.  If she can survive forone year working under the same conditions the Chinese assembly line workers do in the Foxconn &quot;suicide factories&quot; that assemble the IGadgets for Apple Inc., then she will have convinced me that what she says is not the utter self-serving corporate-fascistic poppycock that it appears to be.Kelly, you got the Balls?????

This is the most amazing message! love this!

for example. when you feel relax, you don&#39;t just think &quot;wow I&#39;m relax now&quot;. you will release tensions from your muscles and probably take easy breath. and when you copy what exactly what you do when you relaxed, it becomes actual method of artificial relax. I think we can get some tips from this.

very good point. but there&#39;s something important has missing. this tip will be remain as a kind of mind control unless there&#39;s no body interactive control method.just thinking actually does not make change. If you full, you relief or happy if you breath deep breath, you can relax. so, i&#39;like to suggest to make practical body mind combined stress therapy, or trick.

What doesn&#39;t kill us, makes us handle stress better 

Thank you so much for sharing this, I really enjoyed watching it!I&#39;ve suffered from anxiety since 10 grade in high school and I am now 25. I&#39;ve tried many other anxiety meds and they made it worse.Thank God for Calmmindsystem .I&#39;m back!

Okay. Let&#39;s differentiate here between new-age fluff and actual legitimate science.<b>positive-thinking mantra</b>:-I can do anything if I just visualize it, even if I don&#39;t work to it much.-My thoughts directly impact the world.-I can change <b>other things</b> directly and objectively through my perception.<b>Actual, productive thinking</b>:-I will only accomplish as much as I am willing to work for it.-My thoughts impact my perspective of the world. The chips sometimes aren&#39;t in my favor. My thoughts don&#39;t change that--they just let me play another hand.-I can change myself, and thus the world, through my perception of it. When life gives me lemons, I&#39;ll give people lemonade.So, no, for all of those super-cynics who tout their pessimism like a trophy glorifying their oh-so &#39;contrarian&#39; viewpoint: this video is not suggesting that you should act like your stress doesn&#39;t exist. What she&#39;s saying is that we should make the best of it by seeing it as a way to grow. No, not the &quot;If I just visualize stress being gone, I&#39;ll be happy!&quot; lifestyle. More like, &quot;This is what it is. Here&#39;s what I think of it --that&#39;s better. Now I&#39;ll make it into something admirable.&quot;

If her science is accurate, and I believe it is, this is really important information. Change your belief, reach out and make contact and have more compassion! All good to me.

You said in your ted that stress can be health and un healthy depending how you think about it , I would like to refer you too the Australian hospitals situation which was viewed on a program called 4 corners on the 25th of may   , <a href="">

could save the world :-)

Translating her speech into my language with no CC is really demanding(for school assignment)...She makes me stressful

Mind over body, i am enlightening once more by these ted videos

Truly amazing and inspiring

I propose an experiment, let us strap Kelly in a chair and slowly drip water on her forehead for and long undisclosed length of time (months perhaps) with no breaks of any kind except for food (water is already provided).  Let us see how far her power of &quot;I think I can, I think I can..&quot; takes through this stressful ordeal. Oh yes, one more thing, every 30 minutes she has to solve a difficult technical math problem and in the event she fails to come up with the right answer, she is administered a prolonged and extremely painful electrical shock.  Welcome to the modern corporate workplace.

This type of thinking is infantile delusional....of the order: &quot;if I think hard enough I canlevitate off my bed, then I can.  If I didn&#39;t, then I just have to think harder.&quot;

From WebMD:The Effects of Stress on Your BodyIn this articleHow Does Stress Affect Health?Stress is the body&#39;s reaction to any change that requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses.Stress is a normal part of life. Many events that happen to you and around you -- and many things that you do yourself -- put stress on your body. You can experience stress from your environment, your body, and your thoughts.The Stress Management DietHow Does Stress Affect Health?The human body is designed to experience stress and react to it. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert and ready to avoid danger. Stress becomes negative when a person faces continuous challenges without relief or relaxation between challenges. As a result, the person becomes overworked and stress-related tension builds.Stress that continues without relief can lead to a condition called distress -- a negative stress reaction. Distress can lead to physical symptoms including headaches, upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, and problems sleeping. Research suggests that stress also can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases.Stress also becomes harmful when people use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs to try to relieve their stress. Unfortunately, instead of relieving the stress and returning the body to a relaxed state, these substances tend to keep the body in a stressed state and cause more problems. Consider the following:Forty-three percent of all adults suffer adverse health effects from stress.Seventy-five percent to 90% of all doctor&#39;s office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.Stress can play a part in problems such as headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, skin conditions, asthma, arthritis, depression, and anxiety.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declared stress a hazard of the workplace. Stress costs American industry more than $300 billion annually.The lifetime prevalence of an emotional disorder is more than 50%, often due to chronic, untreated stress reactions.WebMD Medical ReferenceView Article Sources Reviewed by Joseph Goldberg, MD on June 24, 2014

Another lunatic corporate spokewoman trying to convince desk jockey serfs that slavery is not bad.  This single study is bullshit and contradicts every other study ever done on stress in both humans and throughout the mammalian kingdom.

we just have to be very careful about our thinking and believe.

Wow



It depends on what you understand about the word itself &#39;&#39;stress&#39;&#39;

She&#39;s crazy hot.
If people would just pick up the bible and read, they would hear their own words reading so much wisdom, as a man think he is, he is. Jesus, said all through his ministry, &quot;if you just believe, Faith, is all you need for a happy life.&quot; pick it up and read, learn from those who have lived before us.

Most TED talks seem to be more about the speaker than the subject. As if the speaker has finally &quot;made it&quot; because they are doing a TED talk. Not all but most. The subject matter tends to be flimsy.

OMG, that was so amazing and enlightening!

This video is astonishing, but the caption is... strange. I mean, &quot;oxitocin&quot; does not mean &quot;toxin 07&quot;, and &quot;gives out&quot; is definitely not &quot;kissed&quot;. But it gave me a whole new perspective in viewing stress

This just goes to show that God is the perfect scientist. He puts challenges in our lives that can benefit us if we choose to have a good attitude. That&#39;s just my opinion.

&quot;Enjoy the pain&quot; in other words

The subtitles make me feel stressful.

I fell in love with her.

She&#39;s great but man that vocal fry...anyone else&#39;s ears cringe at it? 

OK, then next time when you are stressed out other people merely need to tell you that &quot;Hey, you are just not viewing the situation positively enough&quot;. This video is no good for people who actually have lots of stress. These people need to rest, not to change their mindset and compel their poor body to their limits until them crash.

A flawed interpretation. It could be that what the study finds it&#39;s just a correlation. People who report they believe that &#39;stress is harmful for you&#39; are already seeing the effect of stress on themselves.

Love this! Thank you &lt;3

I&#39;ve always said its better to turn your stress into excitement :)

It is about how you decide to think about it. Like she was saying, you need to change your perception of stress. I remember how when reading psychology still in high school ( University student of psychology these days), my teacher and I got talking about stress and what he said was that &quot; Stress is a sign that you care about the thing that is stressing you out. &quot; - that really struck me.By approaching things differently and seeing them in a different light, you can actually rechannel your psyche to limits you were not even aware of. In this it is your whole body from physical to psychological responses readying you to perform a situation that has a lot of stimulus. Stimulus which does not have to be a bad thing if you decide to just relax and let go.This allows you to perform in front of an audience and be yourself without having to worry you make mistakes, because we all do. It is normal and humane, nothing embarrassing to worry about. These days I do not even care if people laugh when I make mistakes, I laugh at it too.In the same way I came to find that bad experiences can be channeled to be good experiences instead. For example I was diagnosed a lethal case of Chron&#39;s disease in my high school.Even though the experience was really hard because it nearly took my life, now looking back at it the person I was about to become (brat) and the person I am today then I am much rather the person i became trough that experience and with that experience than to be the person I would have been if it never happened to me in the first place.I found that finding the good in the bad is the key of dealing with hardship. Criticism? Sure, it feels frustrating at the moment. But that is until you realize that you can actually turn criticism to a useful tool for self improvement. Alright, I made a mistake doing this or that, but hey now I at least know what I need to pay attention to so I can work on that so I no longer have to make the same mistake again.All of this and so many more other things in your life is only a matter of perspective. What is it you decide to take from your experience and how you decide to view different experiences.

wow..!!! shes beautifull:P



Of course there are stress related health conditions that don&#39;t improve one&#39;s performance, and are just straight bad.  I have central serous retinopathy.  And there&#39;s no &#39;believing&#39; that one into being your friend.

It wasnt stress that made her better and believing that didnt either.it was better to have said, my acceptance of stress made it dissapear.

couldn&#39;t watch the whole video.. it was just too stressful..

Physical stress is good for you if its exercise. It&#39;s mental stress that will kill you.

That was awesome... Those three Easter eggs I just ate will not go to my hips but tone my muscles up to amazing proportion. Yeeah!

Ok, this beer im drinking is really a super-duper mega health shake.. its good for me, its good for me, its good for me..

Cardiomyocytes cannot regenerate! 

I really liked this Ted Talks. She made a lot of sense and kind of gave me some relief when it comes to deal with stress. 

 

Very inspiring and extremely well executed speech! Thank you Kelly!

really nice talk by kelly. a must watch if you want to move smoothly in this stressful life

hey! that&#39;s Madonna when younger!

Ok, so explain to me how long-time exposure to high levels of stress and stress hormones lead to mental illness. I mean, if you have a childhood full of abuse and fear (and aren&#39;t aware of these stress levels because, well, you&#39;re a child) this <b>does</b> influence your mind in a negative way. Children who grow up in stressful situations are mostly not aware of how stressful and harmful their situation is, so you can&#39;t say &quot;their stress is bad for them because they believe it is&quot;.

Want to see what she&#39;s like drunk? Click the cog in the bottom-right, then change the speed to 0.5.

I&#39;m a girl but I think she&#39;s hot.

what she says is beneficial       my issue is with the way she says it

this woman is dangerous.                    she could be hazardous to your health

LIKE x 10000

Per say, STRESS is not the killer.  MAN gave DEATH a Reason, a Face, a Definition AND a Purpose!!  That&#39;s called STRESS.Uncertainties + Doubt = STRESSAwareness + Uncertainties + Doubt = DEATHChoice of Dominant &quot;HAPPINESS, JOY and PLAYFULNESS&quot; Feelings &amp; presence + Awareness + Uncertainties + Doubt = BALANCE.ONLY YOU CAN HURT YOU..............IF.....that is YOUR choice!OF COURSE &quot;STRESS&quot; KILLS, STRESS IS THE REAPER OF FEAR, DOUBTS &amp; UNCERTAINTIES!!Key:  Forgiveness, Love &amp; Accept yourself NO MATTER WHAT!!!Using EFT balances this.

Great presentation. Stuff like this just reminds me how ahead of their time guys like Buddha were, saying things that we are what we think, and that our life experience is a reflection of our thoughts/beliefs

My only concern with studies like this is that people can use them to put more pressure on people. Companies can start putting more pressure on people to deliver then tell them that stress is all in their mind. We have to be very careful about how we handle information like this.

Sorry but watching this vid makes me stress ..... (T_T)

I didn’t look up the dictionary the whole time, just listened to it. Probably because stress actually has many benefits, it depends on how you handle stress.
A lot of people commenting on this video seem to be having difficulty with this woman&#39;s concept in regard to managing stress.  I don&#39;t see the issue.  She explains that your perception of stress has a baring on whether or not it becomes harmful.  By taking away the fear component of stress (due to the fact that it has been evidenced not to be harmful physiologically) the body will be less likely to go into peripheral vasoconstriction, lessening or preventing the associated hypertension that is found to be one of the players in cardiovascular damage within the stress response.  The role of Oxytocin has been briefly explained as a cardio-protector, which she reported salves the harmful effects of harmful stress-related hormones during the response.  In other words, an understanding that stress won&#39;t kill you will allow you to simply work through the stress in an appropriate manner, whilst lessening the negative side-effects of the common negative fear response. 

Did someone noticed the guy who interviewed at last <a href="">13:45</a>, stood up in the audience and applaused <a href="">14:22</a> , MAGIC :P

FAKE IT TILL YOU BECOME IT:  IMMORTAL!!
It&#39;s all in your head. The power of suggestion.

Her talks and publications are astonishing.

It&#39;s VERY true human beings are social creatures

excellent insight to oxytocin.  Kelly is a great public speaker.

absolutely one of the best TED talks.

Thank you! I laughed with delight listening to this crucial information. So intuitively true.Ms. McGonigal says &quot;I find this amazing - that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resiliance, and that mechanism is human connection.&quot;I find it not at all amazing that true re-lig-ion literally means re-connect-ion. Not just human connection, but connection with other life forms, with the earth and universe. Of course this heals.How un-scientific and unethical the current medical practice is of doctors not touching their patients and maintaining what they euphemistically refer to as objectivity. It&#39;s malpractice. Ms. McGonigal has broken out of her faulty training, as I also had to break out of much that I was taught, and medics need to do the same. Re-Connect-ion is a great key.

I saw this in school, but does anyone actually know how to start thinking like this? I mean she said that we need to view it as something helpful, but how do you start? For me, just telling myself that it&#39;s helpful might not be enough to override stress. I don&#39;t get stressed that easily, but this is something I want to get better at.

Wonderful!
check this may rizk
she did not tell what these 20&#39;000 people who died in the &quot;bad stress group&quot; each year, actually died off, could be from anything.. sounds like a bad argument

Thnk you so much for the mindset you already put in my head

She&#39;s right.

mm mmmm baby i like what you&#39;ve got goin on up there on that stage

This sounds like altruism

This looks like a talk based on a misinterpretation of data and flawed assumptions right at the start? I would say my life is stressful but that is because I choose to work in a high pressure job. There is always an escape. I would rate my life as stressful but not damaging my health. I know from experience when I&#39;ve been in a situation where I had to work as hard as I could with no option to do anything else, I physically felt the effect on my heart and energy levels. at that time I would have rated my life as stressful and damaging my health. Could it be that the survey participants were all experiencing high levels of stress but also accurately perceiving whether it was at a point that was damaging their health? I think this is a more likely explanation... it&#39;s at least an alternative way to interpret the data which is presented here as giving a conclusive answer that it it the perception that is damaging, not the type of stress.

Interesting data. Further considerations should be made, as correlation research relies on interpretation and does not necessitate casual relationships, especially when we try to assume the direction of causality. Its common sense that there&#39;s a correlation between a positive outlook and good health, but we don&#39;t know whether positive outlook positively affects health (as proposed by above speaker), or if good health positively affects our outlook. We could just as well say that by being healthy, or perhaps by having a successful history of dealing with stress, we learn not to see stress as an enemy. In reality, the state of the mind is affected by the body, and the state of the body is affected by the mind. This data can also be re-interpreted as an indication that stressing about stress is worse than stress. Once again, common sense.

It started immediate positive impact. Thanks for valuable talk.

This talk is awesome! I wonder how many lives can be saved by practicing the idea of this talk 

Great presentation!!!

how inspiring. sounds like capitalism can work after all.

G

omg she is knowledgeable, smart, positive and beautiful!!!!   I certainly would like to have a woman like her in my life &gt;&lt;

Very interesting! Stress makes you give a better answer to your problems.So innovative, but also so reasonable. Throughout the History men and women have had real problems for survival. REAL problems. Nowadays we are sure to eat and have warm sleep every day of our lives. So why should we be so stressed and ill? Aren&#39;t we just looking so closely to our belly button?

Wow Kelly, you just may need to Key Note a future Compassion Fatigue Symposium and Dance with me and Jule and 300 other Care givers who experience Compassion Fatigue!

Amazing :) Totally changed my view of stress! 

One of my first teachers in the U.S. has your last name, and was my teacher at Boston Latin. Anyhow, I love your talking because I had an induced labor and this changed completely. I will try to send you a better note. Off to work, have a great day.

&quot;McGonigal&quot;? Surprised she&#39;s not teaching in Hogwarts.

The belief that stress helps energize your body can help you live a longer life.

This is why when I am stressed about my financial situation, I volunteer at a animal shelter or rescue organization. I can&#39;t describe the joy I feel helping homeless animals get better, and getting them one step closer to a forever home.  Volunteering doesn&#39;t change my financial situation, it improves my happiness, and ultimately my life. 

this really goes to show how powerful the mind is, such an amazing speech 

Great

one of the most worthy speech ever &lt;3 &lt;3

When I&#39;m under high pressure most of the times my mind just cut off the connection with my body, trapping all the tasks I have to do in my head. Basically, feeling hopeless and helpless, I just do nothing anymore and let stress consume me and ruin everything. In the end, everything is done at the last minute and done very sloppily.. but at least it is alright now, right? No, the stress still comes after me after realizing what bad results I have made and feeling extremely guilty about it.But from now on, I think I&#39;m going to deal with stress the right way! I never understood you, Stress, I&#39;m sorry, let&#39;s become friends!

Kelly McGonigal......she&#39;s givin me some stress!

Fascinating studies and what a great presentation. I&#39;m an avid Kelly McGonigal fan and happy to have found this talk.  I&#39;ve only been looking at stress as something that causes health issues and this certainly changes my perspective.  I&#39;m definitely shifting my attitude and seeing it in a new light. Thank you  Kelly!

gave a lecture on stress management and changed the percieved thoughts about it based on kellys lecture

Good scientific explanation of yoga breathing which was well marketed and benefited Public in China by Indian teacher . the simple rule is as u lead a healthy life style with entire body movements the supply chain for blood flow get eased. And u get good nutrition to your brain and heart and brain which are crucial for good social life.

elite athletes thrive on &#39;stress&#39;

The video has given a whole new direction and purpose to my life.. thanks Kelly

that is brilliant !

Is she related to Jane McGonigal? Striking resemblance.

Really glad I watched this, thank you.

I try to relabel anxiety as excitement.

This is really amazing useful to all.

so what she said is stress is killing us and in the same time releasing oxycotin who heals the damage that stress madeY DO DIS GOD?

.....Stress is problematic!!! It has bad physical and mental responses. Just experience deep stress yourself. You will know how nasty its effect is on our body and mind........The only thing that, I found, fights against stress well is &#39;mindful meditation&#39;.....!!! Besides,loving-kindness meditation can improve one&#39;s positive mental state a couple of times.......

Dr. Kelly needs someone to help her dress for public appearances.

waw!!thank you so much!!

Life changing speech. Superbly delivered too.

Awesome research and presentation..truly changed the meaning of stress :) 

You can see it in several languages ​​through: <a href="">
She looks like she really understood how cosmic energies work.

What she said, was very important. A lot of valuable information.

stop anyone from using puppies and kittens as shark bait, sign here <a href="">

Could someone tell me the people involved and year of the study she mentions at the start, I&#39;d very much like to read it

Cool. What we think is more important than what we face with.&quot;Stressed is just desserts if you can see reverse.&quot;

as a college engineering student who is bad at math and physics, i guess this video literally saved my life

Excellent presentation

This is brilliant.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved her legs a lot and they remkved the stress in me    ha    ha   ha 

This is a great talk, thank you!

This made me realize how stress can be bad, but also good. I always thought that being stressed was a terrible thing. But now I see that being stressed is just allowing me to prepare for the present circumstances and help me overcome them. 

its interesting to hear some laughing about her talking about death statistics as if was a joke and how the bigger silence behind it was louder..........lol

amazing!!
This is kinda change my mind in how to overcome stress.Q: &quot;So, is it better to choose nonstressful jobs over stressful jobs?&quot;A: &quot;Depends on what meaning that you are going to chase in life. If the stressful job matters to you, you are going to handle whatever it costs, and you will overcome everything that it turns out to be.&quot;

she has a point I faction better in stressful situations, when I have little time to do something I get it done

hi Kelly , although i&#39;m not a psychologist or a neuroscientist and totally have no evidence or method to figure out whether stress really does more harm than good. but i agree that at least stress doesn&#39;t have to end with a loss in health or mental health from my own and my friends&#39; experience.I have a friend who is a doctor working in a comparatively good hospital in Beijing,China.And he deal with patients like merchants, lawyers, sometimes people working in I bank.And he told me there are more than twenty people who sleep only 3~4 hours for 3 or more than three years due to work requirement not sure about their health conditions have come for him to check every thing they can,  only to find they just have better health than other people like teacher, artists.Most of them just love their work and really enjoy it. From my own experience, i experienced stress caused by many different reasons. And i figure out that stress itself is just a consequence and only the outer shell, whether i will get harmed depends on the real reason generating it.During the years when curiosity put me into great stress my health and mental health condition was just better than most of my colleagues and pleasure always came together. And i didn&#39;t even get a cold for about 4 years. But one year when stress came from something endangered my life, i lost weight for about 10 pounds in one year and got my first cold during past 6 years.So the real killer maybe not stress itself but some of  mental process that cause it.

i thank you kelly

Verry good content. Posted on EduLand: <a href="">

Awesome

Good luck if you can make stress your friend.

Anyone here read &quot;Zebras Don&#39;t Get Ulcers&quot;. 

Whoa!

Now... do we still credit all these to tiny matters bumping into each other AND evolution?

Great talk!
Good thing for short term stress. Very bad to think long term stress is good.

Stress can&#39;t beat me so I win so I don&#39;t have stress :) I will go to the next video

What if .. people in the study who believed stress is bad for your health, believe it from experience? And those who dont believe it makes them unwell actually are experiencing it differently and aren&#39;t made unwell? Stress is adaptive for a world we dont live in. 

TED Talks is a great forum. Kelly delivered an excellent presentation on this issue.

This brilliant and kind scientist has a long record of modeling innovative personal change. One can see her own recovery from her own devastating illness as proof. I love the kind of stress that pits me against an audience. I love the performance, and the excitement at overcoming opposition. But this TED talk perhaps explains why, despite significant stressors, my blood pressure level has decreased. I&#39;ve been hard at work these last 10 months, strengthening connections to others and nurturing a network of change-minded friends, who consciously support each other. PS We are, additionally, having a great time. 

amazing study！ It&#39;s really helpful! Thanks for sharing

It was Kelly&#39;s very last comment to &quot;Follow what gives Meaning in Your Life&quot; that changes how you think about the stress. 

good one (Y), now I will be better when I will be stressed ;)

In short <a href="">10:57</a>

How could anyone know this kind of information and NOT believe in any kind of higher intelligence which created such systems??? There are countless other examples similar to oxytocin such as serotonin....

Sorry, but we respond to Chemicals......  They don&#39;t control what we do.

interesting! new perspective :)
Wow

the idea is not to add more stress in your life by worrying about negative consequences of stress %))

This is very similar with other old studdies like the Roseto, Pennsylvania - where people have not died from heart disease even though they lived in poorer health conditions than all other americans, ate much more fats etc.. but somehow non of the villigers died of heart failure. The study after several ideas was very controversial since the only logical explanation they found was not very appealing to the science community.

OMG that shirt!!! Where can I buy that????

Wonderful closing &quot;chasing meaning than to avoid discomfort&quot;.

WOW this is AWESOME!

i guess the question is...how do you make yourself really believe that stress is good for you? How does one come to believe that wholeheartedly?

Now for sure i will remember this talk in stressfull conditions....

Wow.. i can&#39;t realise how this video came to me.. Because it&#39;s exactly what i needed to find. It&#39;s really life changing with so simple principles, work with stress instead of wanting it to vanish. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G . Thank you Kelly McGonigal for your study and mostly for sharing so much interesting facts with us.  

shes hot

Hi, is there a way to embed in blog with translate?

She herself seems pretty nervous and stressed to me.

She&#39;s a bit annoying -- but I appreciate her point. 

sorry  but  i didn&#39;t feel anything  helping  in this Video,  maybe  im not stressful person ,  just nothing spacial  in what  she said .  but shes  smart making money out of peoples fear.

Great sharing! Being positive defineitely can change astressful situation into a blessing.Thanks for the posting and sharing.

Great video!

people feel better when they go to the doctor, even if the doctor doesn&#39;t prescribe anything. The doctor just say to them you are fine. And it&#39;s true, my friend did something to one colleague, one after another they said to him &quot;you don&#39;t look fine, something&#39;s wrong with you&quot; after 15 minutes the guy really felt bad and started to change his color, he wanted to go to doctor.

You create the biology of courage

great

I think that this makes sense. Reminds me of the concept of thinking of stress like exercise, you become more able to deal with it the more you train

I really enjoyed this video, and feel it could actually change how i view stress.Although, it did make me chuckle to think that dying could be beaten by the power of love.. its like a cringy joke :)

amazing and true

I only clicked on this because she was hot. Always find it more attractive from a woman is educated.

I like the way she says &quot;Stress&quot;.

her voice make me anxious

Awesome! Very informative! Well done introducing this new science

Beautiful and amazing!!

it&#39;s such an amazing TEd talk that i&#39;ve ever seen. Some magic changes come from your belief

what a powerful speech.

I definitely go for that... chase what will give meaning to your life instead of avoiding stressful situations.

I wonder if they sell oxytocin at Wal-Mart?

She&#39;s not really distinguishing between chronic and acute stress, which sadly is pretty essential for this subject matter.

fantastic video
Makes sense with what I always believed, that helping others is actually physically beneficial for your health. 

Amazing talk! 

I really have been getting into these Ted talks lately I really enjoy them now.

Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton

Wow she defiantly helps to create positive stress!!

I love how she says &quot;bawwdy&quot;

Great talk
Sexy

Levels of depression may just have increased from the increase in technology reducing the person to person contact the world once knew. Put the phones down and close the laptops. Don&#39;t post your problems on FB, go and talk to a friend.

Very good speech, I&#39;ll take it to heart :)Too bad for the vocal fry at the end of most sentences.

This is how videos can change the world. Thanks! 

I read &quot;how to stress your friend&quot; thought i could silently and subtly freak out everyone i know. Damn xD

I love the video, but I don&#39;t quite understand how exactly I can adopt the mindset of &quot;stress is helping me.&quot; For example, I&#39;m an upperclassman in high school. I get very stressed out for the whole week of final exams, and I get very stressed when going to the first day of school. How can I relieve some of this stress, or at least convince myself that the stress is beneficial?

&quot;me too&quot;, no that&#39;s not how it works.

nice speech

how can I make her my friend?

I actually think this way, i didn&#39;t know the science behind it but i have always thought that i flourish in stressful, anxious moments i actually feel more alert. This was a great Talk and it&#39;s really good to know this can be healthy

I just fell in love with psychology all over again cz of her! 3

This might be one of the best TED talks I have ever seen!

I came in feeling unstressed and pretty good.  Then she said that stress can be good for you and I started to freak out.  Then she explained how you can turn stress into a positive and I started feeling better.  Now I&#39;m unstressed and getting a little uneasy.

Don&#39;t STRESS on STRESS

Everyone there thinks she&#39;s a laughing stalk&#39; HAHA

When under stress - what is your thinking posture towards that stress?  A great TED talk that prompts me to think of James 1:2 in the ancient text of scripture.... 

Nice and Important!

Explains a lot!
STRESSED=DESSERTS:)

This is Pseudo-Science at it&#39;s best. Make people answer questionaires and then draw the wildest connections. I really had it, when she said, that in this group of people, having had a major event of stress raised mortality by 30%, but only for the ones that didn&#39;t help others. Conclusion: Helping others counters the effect of stress on your health. That the ones who didn&#39;t help others maybe were in SO MUCH stress, that they did&#39;t have time for that is far more plausible. This kind of science is just crap, yet so much is built upon it. Read <a href="">

So good people really don&#39;t die young.  Thank you Kelly!  I will be doing a lot more research on my health and be more willing to dive head first into life&#39;s challenges :-D

I wanna refer to a relevant quote: &quot;The truth is that stress doesn&#39;t come from your boss, your kids, your spouse, traffic jams, health challenges, or other circumstances. It comes from your thoughts about these circumstances&quot;Andrew Bernstein

Great

lies delusion   misinformation
pain, illness  eviction. stress
I hope that this helps those who have suffered with severe stress all of their lives. Perhaps they will learn how to cope without harming loved ones with their current practices used to deal with reality. I tend to believe that this message implies a method of changing perspective to better understand stressful situations; an excellent practice but not easily mastered.

Nature loves courage. -Terrence McKenna

What she is saying, I don&#39;t agree. I believe you can&#39;t do good with stress, but you can do good in stress.

Reverse psychology
I love TED talk!  this  was great.

The main trouble always seems to be in how we perceive occurences that cause all the troubles. For example, how we perceive a recent death in the family, financial struggles, paralysis, job loss, or even an upcoming presentation or marriage, 

Caring creates resilience- the memory verse right there.

just what i needed to hear now. excelent!

Not only do I love this - but I adopted this advice in my OWN life. Great advice.

her beauty stressed me up

You are beautiful,ur eyes are attractive but still I got the whole talk that means ur talk is captivating.Good work on stress...

damn she&#39;s one fineee~ lady. 

She&#39;s so stupid lol

20,000 deaths a year from believing stress will kill you? Not nearly as many die from believing death will kill you.

kelly just found a new follower... me... wow!... amazing presentation. articulate, emotional, factual, engaging. impressive.

Amazing. We all need to change our perception of stress!

I like to share a small insight that I have.Would you be able to become drunk of not-alchahol liquit if you believed it had alchahol?I know that I can&#39;t get imaginary drunk but I know that some people can. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t be generelyzing about the power of belief; it might just be a subset of humanity that has a mind more connected to their body.I have never experienced any physical truma to my body. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is depression, stress, heart-breaking situations and so on. I have been in situations where I believed I was drinking alchahol but I didn&#39;t get drunk. I believe that my mind has no power to my body and this has shaped me differently.It seems real to me that that people experience &quot;power&quot; of belief differently but there seem to be little targeted research on this topic. There are lot of general assumptions of the &quot;power of belief&quot; and I think they all miss the mark.

I hate to be &quot;That&quot; person but i am stressful every single day and this did not help me the slightest.Thanks for trying though. 

There are far too many of us suffering from sleeplessness and migraines stress can be the underline source we are buying painkillers every other day for far too long we have been ignoring this issue please help me put a device out there that will alleviate that donate to my project so that I can pursue this dream spread the word share it our brains need something to help ease that tension and that&#39;s what I am working to donate please follow the link below your donations will be truly appreciated.<a href="">

So what she&#39;s really saying isn&#39;t that stress is good but that being positive is good.  The study she talks about at the beginning is a classic case of bad science:  CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION.  The message isn&#39;t wrong, per se, but kind of mixed up.

I have a theory. I don&#39;t think that the actual act of believing stress is good for you affects you physically and makes you any healthier, but I think that when you change your mental state by thinking stress is good for you, you almost trick your mind because you don&#39;t let the negative thoughts get to you. It&#39;s all in the mind. We get stressed out and then we can&#39;t think rationally, but when you start believing stress is a good thing, you feel better about the state you are in. Kind of like a placebo effect.

good damn thing
Thank you for this. Amazing. You have changed my view of stress

Thank you for this. Amazing. You have changed my view of stress

awesome insightsIts new strategy for me but i guess its ganna work with methanks

Harmful or helpful? That all depends on what you think bout stress! Very good to know.

This is excellent!

So really, it&#39;s the anxiety that kills you, not the stress. 

she has some nice legs...

so playing horror games is healthy :)

One the best ones yet. Love this

THANK YOU KELLY:) 

OMG. I love this video . Thanks , &quot;Handle life&#39;s challenges&quot;&quot;

Interesting,  now provide more talks, on details/examples ect... of how to maintain lower stress levels by using the outline you just provided us. For most people this won&#39;t seek in enough as it should.

This is great, but the closed captioning is very wrong. May I suggest updating it to be accurate? Thanks.

Amazing
I would marry this girl.

It is a game of positive thinking. Good job. congratulations. 

Very interesting/useful talk.

Absolutely fantastic talk - one of the best I&#39;ve seen on TED

Thank You

Perspective about stress. Make it your friend. Face the challenge of being stress. Turn negative into positive. When you&#39;re handed with lemons make lemonade. When we change the way we look at things, the things we look at change. Well delivered Kelly.

Is she the sister Jane? I think Jane said that she had a sister named Kelly.

This speech is linear, misleading and ignorant. Stress exists before the belief in the effects of stress being harmful, the belief it is harmful may exacerbate it&#39;s effects but it will still have negative effects on health and lead to potentially disturbing scenarios if one chose to believe stress was good.For example, you have a s**tty boss. Your boss picks up on this research, misinterprets it due to the lack of rigor in the study and uses it as justification to continue treating you like s**t. You allow yourself to continue being treat like s**t because you now believe stress is good. Your boss is a psychopath and a narcissist and exhibits the trait of lacking in empathy, you now respond as if stress/abuse is good and also lack empathy and do nothing when others are being abused because you believe it is good for them. This is self-perpetuated auto-destruction with adoption of psychopathic traits. Stick that in a psychology book.Mind ControlAlso stress can be induced by toxins, addictions and unnatural environments which can and demonstrably do alter, behaviour and brain/body/immune function. Knowing the environment has alot to do with stress and behaviour it&#39;s pretty ignorant to victimise a persons beliefs. Science is also a belief system, it exists nowhere but the human mind. A tool of measurement to gauge reality and yet it doesn&#39;t quite have all the necessary tools to perceive everything exactly as it is in reality, whatever reality is. Although we find, many believe it currently does already have the tools to give all the answers, aside from the one&#39;s who accept it doesn&#39;t, the real scientists who know those tools don&#39;t exist.

So... If I&#39;m stressed... I hug someone?

Excellent !
I like the ease of title to views.  Stress less and see the you tube that explains the world comprehensive solution when you have 83 minutes to see it, called &quot; To Attain Nelson Mandela Wish Every Person Say&quot; 

Thanks Kelly! This video will help save lives, maybe even my own!!

A brilliant talk by a brilliant person. Thank you for uploading.

Just excellent.

Wonderful piece...

I can help with instant stress and depression relief

 I love TED talks! This was not excellent.

Your brain is a computer. Program it wisely. :)

This is absolutely the key. Most alcoholics are taught their drinking is bad and that creates a situation where every drink is a knowing toxification rather than encouraging them to make the problem smaller. If you were told watching YouTube videos was destroying, say, speech, addictive personalities - by definition those who challenge a consumable to kill them - would increase viewing rate. Stress is a built up boogeyman too - the societal regard: no stress = you&#39;re not hardworking

This is NOT new science. Look up the Yerkes-Dobson curve created a long time ago in 1908; It shows that a certain amount of stress improves cognitive and physical functions. I also remember being taught the positive aspects of stress in my early teens at high school nearly 15 years ago. I thought a lot of this was common knowledge and to be honest I don&#39;t particularly like the presenter&#39;s delivery, especially the part about saying how this is a &quot;new discovery&quot;

no use stressing out cant change a thing and you are no good for yourself and no one else try to be Calm and things fall into place

no use stressing out cant change a thing and you are no good for yourself and no one else try to be Calm and things fall into place

This is such a great Ted talk. I&#39;m not very good at handling stress and I&#39;ve always been trying to decrease it, while I can actually use stress as a tool. 

this is an amazing talk and i have learn a lot from this one

that is good learn

That last study she mentions reeks of confounding.  A follow up time of 5 years?  If you were healthy enough to be ABLE to help others, you were probably healthy enough to not die in the next 5 years.  Interesting talk none the less.

well !! hats off Ms. Kelly....i want you to watch this ....however....we do need to make thing certain in our minds that ...stress is a relative term...what means stress to one ....may not be stressful for another....so to identify the stress inducing actions/ situations is v imp.....Ms. Kelly is right....it all depends on the way we respond to a situation that decides how our body wud react to some incidence...:) 

Excellent speech delivery. You&#39;ve transmitted a trully profound message to transform my life ^^ Thanks Kelly &lt;3

Stress is self-induced, most of the time, by people that&#39;d like to think their lives are difficult or hard; it gives their lives some meaning. Unless you&#39;re a CEO/Chairman (or leader of some kind), have a life-risking job, are facing a life-altering problem (extreme debt; on the precipice of insolvency, face jail-time, etc), your life is not stressful. Soccer mom is not stressful. Getting annoyed by people around you is not stressful. You&#39;re pathetic and need to suck it up. Your life is not hard. You trivialize all the serious issues when you make it about small things. I&#39;m tired of everyday people saying their lives are stressful. 

Her shoes are from Tory burch ! I want them !

The talk doesn&#39;t address effects of stress on people who aren&#39;t aware that their body is subjected to stress but just carry on with life with/without meaning.  

I think we can all wear this now: <a href="">

So you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re responsible for a shitload of deaths? How is she not in prison now?

Oh, now I understand why my father couldn&#39;t help himself kicking me around the house when I was young. He should have felt better about himself.

this sounds ridiculous to me...

I have a question: I had a lot of stress this year because I am studying and I am 20 years old and what can I do because I have been depressed and paranoid about everything. I have gone to a doctor seeing someone like a psychiatrist and counsellor but I feel that I am getting worse with everything that I do eg studying, working and my family life etc. I just need someone to talk to who can understand what I am going through. Can you please guide me in the right path that could help me when dealing with stress and other stuff. I live in Australia Sydney. Please feel free to comment and send me an email. 

Thank you! :)

smart and attractive. great speaker

Quality video! I love seeing such pure positivity being spread. 

She&#39;s just amazing! :)

This video may have changed my life from this moment!

A qoute  in  Hindi my Native  Language - Apni  Drishti Badlo - Srishti  Apne  aap  badal Jaayegi &quot; - Translated  - Change the way  you  view  Life and the  world  around  you  and  your  Life  and  world  would  change&quot;See  stress as  a  friend - Find  the  meaning in  stress - Use  it  as an  ally - Help  others  ......Belive  me  then  stress  would  become a  friend 

Thank you Kelly! I was taking a court mandated online drug class that had a YouTube video that I was required to watch, and at the end of the video, I saw the link to this video and I decided to take a break from my coarse to see what you had to say. I really like what you&#39;ve shared.

Like if the speed at which she speaks de-stresses you!  What a nice talk.

Wow awesome speaker

Chasing meaning is better for your health than avoiding discomfort. Go after what&#39;s meaningful and trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.

Chasing meaning is better for your health than avoiding discomfort. Go after what&#39;s meaningful and trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.

I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t not even begin to understand how extreme stress such as a panic attack we I cannot breath can be help in any way ever! Especially when it&#39;s a delayed stress attack.

great video, thanks :) 

She&#39;s also hot :) 

Now I&#39;m Stressed. LOL.

boring

Helpful info on stress by Kelly McGonigal on TED Talks. Helped me.  <a href="">#TEDtalks</a>     <a href="">#stress</a>     <a href="">#oxytocin</a>   

thank U. very interesting video !!  

Watch this if you would like to convert your stress into a positive for your life actually enhancing your health and wellness

Watching this the night before my AP Exam

Thank you!

thank you  maam.....thnx a lott for this..!!!

People who have lots of stress but don&#39;t think its harmful aren&#39;t really having stress, they&#39;re just busy. Aka active. Aka probably getting more exercise than the lazy bums who have no stress.

I hate to be that guy, but... damn she&#39;s hot!

Brilliant, professional, and amazing speaker.

That answer in the end - she either had it preprepared or .... damn! she is a quick thinker. 

Using stress as an adrenaline boost! Gonna try this technique. What have I got to lose?

Do you &quot;think&quot; better when you are stressed or when you are still and calm? Do you serve an ace when you are stressed or when you are relaxed (under no pressure)? 10 years later she might do a volte face again!!! 

I&#39;m always very &quot;schtressfull&quot;...
That was solid. 

This amazing woman is my new hero.

A thought I had when she mentioned that oxytocin is part of a stress response: Do people who have gotten Stockholm Syndrome have elevated levels of oxytocin as part of the stress response to being held captive?

sadly, i face my stress alone.
its in edinburgh!

Soooooo, if you lack oxytocin you suffer from heartbreak? <a href="">10:06</a>

Makes sense, I&#39;ve always enjoyed stress, it really gives me energy and a nice natural buzz.

This is something really unbelievable !! Very helpful for each one of us. Awesome work lady!! Hope I can resolve my heart and blood pressure issue with it.

I love this, but help.  I saw this the first time and it allowed for subtitles in a zillion languages.  This video now doesn&#39;t have that option. Anyone know how to get it back?

I&#39;m not so sure, which kind of stress are we talking about?  If the stress is the kind that a person feels helpless to break year in year out, or in a corner, or you&#39;re working 3 jobs to keep up....

She is remarkable. Just when I thought I couldn&#39;t handle life&#39;s stresses, this speech gave me a whole new perspective as to why I put myself through these situations.

loved!!!! i was blessed by this.

How can I think positively about the kinds of stress that doesn&#39;t increase my heartbeat or can&#39;t feel the effects of. Such as being in college and having loads of homework, my body doesn&#39;t have an immediate reaction it seems like

This woman needs to be giving talks to our armed forces who are going to face extremely stressful combat situations. Maybe these ideas could help lower the instances of PTSD. 

This is interesting. I know that when I&#39;m stressed I hate being alone or left alone. I want to be around people. I had always thought it was me wanting to just &quot;take my mind off&quot; whatever was stressing me out. Perhaps it&#39;s a physiological response to be more social and therefore less stressed.

Profound.  Classic TED.

Wow. I think this woman just changed my life.

They say that going through crisis creates deeper bonds with the ones succouring you...so, that&#39;s part of because of a hormone called oxcytocin? ö.ö&#39; Science...

aHow would I go about getting permission to use this video for training purposes?  I facilitate training for foster, adoptive and kinship families and I am presenting at a national conference in June.  I love the messages shared in this video and I think many caregivers would benefit from seeing it.  The course I&#39;m presenting is called, &quot;All Stressed Up and Nowhere to Go.&quot;

BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH, I&#39;m sure she stresses out half of the guys she&#39;s dated. BS

take a shot when she says stress response! 

Wow - having a positive attitude to lifes challenges can make all the difference

Last words were amazing! 

This woman is awesome.

the dislikes may have something to do with the fact doing something for others is needed, and we all know how truly burdensome helping other people can be.

One of my weaknesses would be to not care very much about discouraging faces and if someone was harassing me during a math test, I would yell, &quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; right at them. This can be both good and bad I guess. It is good that I do not let people&#39;s opinions of me get me down, but being the type of person who would yell in that situation might bring about unnecessary stress. It probably means that I am not great under pressure, which I guess I am not.

Wow! I had no idea that I was positively using stress to justify procrastination in high school. I guess I was being healthy, not lazy, the whole time.

I watched this 3 times, wrote down several quotes, and wonder; can this can explain resilience in people who endure horrendous experiences yet, overcome their difficulties while, others crash and burn or become self destructive?

What the fuck is wrong with her eye when she looks all the way to her left?  It looks like she has eye flaps lol.

What she is basically saying is stay positive.i used to get stressed and i still do but when you have positive attitude it initaially  helps your outlook on everything this is ridiculously simplebut mislabeled stress is a negative that cant help  and i cant believe there is a seminar on this.

Yeah a lot of this is iffy at best!

wow , just what I wanted to hear right now.

Brilliant TED Talk on how stress can actually be really good for you. Watch this - it just might save your life.

Excellent!
brilliant

In today's world we really have to learn to use stress to our advantage! :)
she sounds like sean connery &quot;shtress&quot;....

Excellent presentantation....after all life is about perspective and you can change the world around you if you change the perception of your own life. Congratulations Kelly!!!

Its a basic failure to not understand your terms. There is distress which can cause a negative and eustress which is positive. If you dont start from there all of your lines are muddled to begin with.

Thank you Ms. McGonigal this was a very helpful talk.

Very interesting, as is most stuff on TED!

I love you Kelly !!!! :)

Wonderful lecture...Thanq McGonial.......Stress is GOOD....if we know how to manage it......there are lot of simple, reliable, measurable techniques we teach students in our workshops........&quot;POWER WITHIN&#39;...&amp;....&quot;MAKE YOUR CHILD - A GENIUS&quot;

I like it

Something m gonna rewatch again and a again :) 

goddamn the human mind is powerful

Fantastic! I enjoyed This so much! Deepest gratitude &amp; appreciation! Love multiple professionals in their field supporting &amp; teaching us what belief does from a broader more detailed perspective in our lives. Like Dr. Bruce Lipton You address years of experience with the genius of being genuine. Straight to the heart in the best way... Blessings &amp; oxytocin filled hugs for all...

Thank you so much for this Kelly McGonigal. I appreciate it.

I feel like this is the &quot;key&quot; to overcoming anxiety or phobias.

she is an amazing public speaker. wow.

Needs a book full of techniques now! &quot;The Biology of Courage&quot; Very cool. :)

Those legs . . .
Thank you.

Well it&#39;s kind of common sense isn&#39;t it? The more positive you are about things the healthier you will be. If you&#39;re stressing a lot and then on top of that you worry that the stress might kill you, that doubles the amount of stress immediately. So to me it&#39;s kind of obvious that those people who think stress will kill them are less healthy. 

&quot;Go after what is creating meaning in your life, and then trust yourself to handle what follows.&quot; ~Kelly McGonigalh/t Stephan Hovnanian for encouragement to watch the video <a href="">#tedtalk</a>   <a href="">#stress</a>   <a href="">#stressmanagement</a>  

<b>How To Make Stress Your Friend</b>When Kelly McGonigal (psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University) first told her audience that a belief in the harmful effects of stress — and not stress itself — was a serious health risk, many people laughed.But by the end of her talk, most of them were willing to accept that a change in their perception of stress rather than the elimination of it could save them from a premature death.Her presentation, &quot;How To Make Stress Your Friend,&quot; draws on three recent studies that reveal how stress is a natural reaction to adversity, and if you stop becoming anxious about your stress, the body can naturally cope in a healthy way.----------- <a href="">#stressmanagement</a>     <a href="">#tedtalk</a>   

Sexy scientist. I can&#39;t stop looking at her legs.

Wow! Thank you for that

Now I know why I grew as an anxious child, because people kept judging me and I didn&#39;t rise against my shyness. My life style was pretty lonely too and now that I think about it I was always happier and felt better when hanging around people who accepted me.

omg this just brought on my anxiety. how and why?????

Ted watch ur back

So it depends on man&#39;s attitudes toward stress, not stress itself. :-) 

YESSSSS!! IT WORKED FOR MY  PRESARIO CQ 56

 it!
Interesting, I did exactly the social stress study before.. It was a traumatic experience.. lol

She is my inspiration

well the heart has most definitely earned its reputation in romanticism ...

Do not stress about your stress.

EXCELLANT!!!

I love your speach!

So... who else is watching this for a class? (-_-)

Very positive approach to Stress, trying look at stress from different angle,interesting perception.

Oh the religion of the Prophet...this girl speaks a hundred percent English
Oh the religion of the Prophet...this girl speaks a hundred percent English
One of the best videos, Must watch!

I usually disregard anything a psychologist has to say as I consider it too pseudo-scientific, but this lady actually made sense and used verifiable biological facts!Good talk.

kelly &#39;s approach and guidance will definitely help people cope up with stress. stress is unavoidable in today&#39;s world, but if we learn to live with it , it will be definitely helpful.

Stressed? who is stressed?!  Nevaa!! :)

Once the stress of any challenge is completed, just like in the Olympics, you judge yourself and others judge you on your vision and execution.  Whether it be a project at work, at school or at home--and that judgement overrides &quot;seeing stress as a positive.&quot;

Very inspiring. Would be nice to see a link to the Harvard study she is referring to

I wish I was surrounded by people like you. At Least, I could be wiser than I am. What I think the major problem with us is, we are taught not to stress at all.We can not change mother nature. When we fail to control our stress, we feel disappointed, angry, desperate and so on. In this video I learned how to turn stress to my best. One more thing, I think depression is the result of stress for a long time.

We&#39;ve been thinking wrong about stress all the time.

EVERYONE...WATCH THIS! May be one of the most important things you can watch!

Your degree of intelligence, physical prowess and adaptability (whether biological, social, economic or political) determines your degree of stress.  The less your aptitudes or skills are, the more &quot;believing&quot; you&#39;ll have to do.   If you do not have the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, then it&#39;s extremely important to believe all your stress is positive.  It&#39;s important to note, there are degrees.

I suppose, too, if I believe I can see clearly with my eyes, when in fact, I am nearsighted and see blurry, the stress level would be lower.  But the reality is, I am seeing blurry and not sharp for biological reasons.  Thank goodness for glasses, that stress is utterly wiped out.  If we believe we&#39;re smart, and we&#39;re not (in fact, lack a lot of critical thinking skills), it produces faith and optimism--and possibly a longer life--but along with it--being boring for all your naive innocence.  On a separate note, reaching out to others (esp. those with biological shortcomings) is always good karma!  Around 1284 in Italy, Salvino D&#39;Armate invented the first wearable eye glasses, aiding those with bad stress caused by bad vision.

that&#39;s awesome, impressive how she could discover and show us the other hiden side that none know about stress. 

Her response to the question after the talk is the key, &quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort&quot;.

Wow this is so amazing thank you Kellly i have watched this video 5 times,,  Thank you.

Fantastic speech Kelly! I like your topic, contents , and eyes as well lol. Good job!!

If there is no one to share with when you are stressed that shorts circuits the process doesn&#39;t it? Also, if your stress level causes you to REACT out of stress versus a calmer thoughtful approach to a problem, then I would not consider stress helpful. I was hoping to hear some keys to avoid REACTion and act wisely under stress. There is only so much stress a person can handle without relief. There must be a point at which you O.D. on oxytocin.





confounders anyone?

extremely powerful stuff! i will spread the word... and re-watch as needed.

But what about Long Term Stress? PTSD?

not buying it.

Absolutely correct 

&quot;A Whole New Way To Think About Stress That Changes Everything We’ve Been Taught &quot;I&#39;ve got to look into this new perception of Stress idea…. :-)

really love her expression and her voice !!

As good as this video may be seen it isn&#39;t much more than that thinking positively is great anytime. That in itself helps a lot, while stress can be good in certain circumstances, mostly for plain survival. Positive thinking and less stress is the best :o)

Anyone else see Bill Gates in the middle at <a href="">4:07</a>??

Did she just admit that she killed 182,000 people? 

There are moments of brilliance and one is at the end when she responds to his question....... to choose something not because it is less stress but choose the thing that &quot;CREATES MEANING IN YOUR LIFE&quot;. Maybe that is the less stress road, maybe not. Certainly more money, more things don&#39;t create meaning. That is clear.

Ssoo......, there is no spoon?

This is pure pseudoscience of the worst kind and is dangerous.  Seriously dangerous.The speaker is ignoring the fact that there are two sorts of stress, Eustress and Distress, and trying to claim that all stress is Eustress.  This is a common characteristic of bullying managers and other psychological abusers.

This video is stressful!

I keep finding confirmation of Seth&#39;s channeled teachings from back in the 70&#39;s, and this is one more to add to the list; In THE NATURE OF PERSONAL REALITY he talks extensively about how our BELIEFS about food affect our bodies more than the contents of the foods themselves…In various ways, the same goes for drugs, exercise, sleep, etc. The idea that people view their stress as something negative also sounds to me like it could stem from beliefs that our natural selves can&#39;t be trusted; We&#39;re afraid that if we act on our impulses or SEEMINGLY negative emotions, they might betray us in some way. But failing to follow through simply dams up those reservoirs of energy and increases stress and frustration, causing a perfectly appropriate and healthy response to turn against itself, which damages your organs and leads you to lash out against the world in order to combat your feelings of powerlessness. But even knowing all this, the task of exploring your beliefs and the full contents of your mind is actually more work than most people will ever care to do...

&quot;Chasing meaning&quot;—I sure agree with that! I love it; so often, we who chase meaning are considered neurotic and maladjusted for not getting with the materialist program. It&#39;s great to have validation that caring is healthy, as if we were created to care, and that mercy, love, and other virtue do good to our bodies and souls.Selye was the one who first lumped the bad and good &quot;stressors&quot; together under the label of stress.  Obviously, some stressors are good ones and others bad. I&#39;d definitely rate oxytocin among the good and helpful ones! But there is truth that there is such a thing as too much stress, even of the good ones. The search for meaning can even leave you overwrought, although it is generally better than the alternative. But you last longer if you can moderate stress just enough to not be overcome by it. Sometimes you can&#39;t, and positive self-talk does not change that. Selye called his book The Stress of Life, and he, too, posited stress as a good thing, necessary to life, not to be avoided, but too much could exhaust our supply of coping ability, which was seen as fixed, I believe. It is good to realize that there are intricate mechanisms to help us not be overcome, and that as living beings and organisms, we can perhaps make more, within reason! I expected this to be a new age positive self talk sermon, but there was much that was worthwhile in this.

I disagree. My mother got cancer five years ago, I had to take care of her, which cost me a great amount of stress, no gratification what so ever. Later on, I got a very stressful job, and then I got burn out and one of the worst cases of depression my Dr. have ever seen.Adrenaline is our response to stress, the hormone we produce when in danger the one responsible for the fight or flight response, and the hormone we produce when we are stressed, when we have too much of it in our body we suffer anxiety among other things. Stress has never brought me anything good, from migraines to stomach problems, to depression, I dont see how I can change my view on it when I feel horrible after a very stressful day.

~ ~ ~ yeah ~ ~ ~  

I think it&#39;s great what Kelly is saying in this video, though, I do have one caution about taking all this data and coming to the conclusion that we should simply change our views about stress.  It clearly shows that people who believe stress is bad for them have much more health consequences than those who do not.  What it doesn’t talk about is how successful people can be about changing their views of stress.  What if the people who believed stress was bad for them were more sensitive energetically, and had that belief because of the effects they experienced, not the  other way around?

God damn. why did Martin Luther King have a heart of a 60 year old then?

i hate stress. i &#39; m bad at dealing with it .

Great talk Kelly.  Defiantly changed my views on stress. 

I love this video!As a very stressed out elementray music teacher, this really helps me to change my view about stress. I try to do activities to reduce my stress, breathing, and things that give me a &quot;break&quot; from the school day. This has made me feel as if there is hope for me, and that I won&#39;t keep waking up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach and not able to sleep because I am so stressed about things in the coming day. I really appreciate it!!

The color of her pants is disturbing..

Beautiful. I love the sentiment of courage being the healthy response. This was a very heartening speach.

Great talk, thank you TED and Kelly! I appreciate the comment at the end: &quot;pursue meaning and trust yourself to handle the stress that follows&quot;. I have good stress and bad stress in my life... I recognize the good stress is just me feeling scared of being out of my comfort zone, and pushing through that always means awesome growth. The bad stress is when I&#39;m not aligned with my values, or in other words, the &#39;meaning&#39; that Kelly references. 

Believing anything about your body to react negatively will bring on the correct reaction to it. If you believe in a curse or hex, that bad situation of the hex will come to you. Belief is a power manifestation technique that shapes our reality the moment we think of something to happen or could happen. Calming your thoughts in false beliefs of negative effects on stress and other issues will help you become happier and healthier without doing much of anything.

Real nice video from @kellymcgonigal! You know it’s not just true in the subject of ‘stress’ but about any topic. There is seldom any universal truth. What we ‘believe’ becomes our own personal truth. And this is proven now scientifically.Those who believes that life is fun, that’s how life becomes. Those who believe life is difficult, that’s how life turns out. Those who believe that only honest way to be rich is to work hard, can never make a lot of money without working long hours, but those who believes that money comes to them effortlessly &amp; easily tend to earn honestly but from comparatively less effort. Same is for health, relationship everything. Don’t you know some who eat fastfood &amp; doesn’t exercise much, but still maintain a healthy &amp; fit physique?Have you studied materials by Louise Hay, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Esther &amp; Jerry Hicks (Abraham)? Their work gives a in-depth insights on this subject.



funny :)

Hey ain&#39;t she the professor in the Harry Potter movies?

Bright!
McGonial sisters rock TEDTalks

Wonderful video about one of our deepest concerns: how to make our clients aware that in the way they think and react to stress is the result of that internal interaction: progressive, motivating or hindering, depressive and sickening. We see stress as a force, an energy, the use of which depends on each person. Thank you
Wonderful video about one of our deepest concerns: how to make our customers aware that the way they think and react on stress is the result of that internal interaction: progressive, motivational or impeding, depressing and sickening. We see stress als a force, an energy those use depends on you. Thank you.

Very inspirational. Also that last name takes me back to harry potter.

Very good and extremely helpful.

What is it I can hear bad pronunciation did she recently get rid of braces?

definite dom
I don&#39;t concur. The people that were stressing out about stress ARE &quot;stressed.&quot; I think challenges are healthy for the brain but constant stress cannot be good. My mother is in her mid 30s and suffered stroke. Cause was likely due to stress as stated by the neurologist because she had no health problems and our family history is clean of stroke. She had good blood pressure and normal cholesterol reading. I&#39;d enjoy the conference nonetheless. 

Shoot I need to hear this!

An amazing talk. Very helpful. 

Not being able to rip those red pants off was very stressful. 

This actually makes real sense and i have a example of experience inmylife who really backs her up: sorry if it sounds weird but the thing is when I amabout to have sex my hear starts punding with nervosism over the possibility or messing up things or not being good enough; then my mind identifies that i am getting stressed and thinks that that stress will prevent me from concetrating and then its a snow ball..HOWEVER, at the times i saw this inicial heart pounding and nervosis as normal , i actually enjoyed and &#39;&#39;performed&#39;&#39; better! TO SUMMARIZE: Being nervous before sex WILL NOT mess up things. What will mess up things is OVERTHINKING about the BEING NERVOUS...    Thanks for that speech was amazing and sorry for the bad english (im not a native)

being able to hear her moist mouth movements just stressed me out. 

I&#39;ve always believed and know that stress is the best thing for you provided it comes from something worthwhile, it actually makes you more productive and efficient. I call that positive stress.That&#39;s why I&#39;ve always deliberately created positive stress for myself with brilliant results. Nobody dies from pushing himself towards a worthwhile goal.It is stress that comes from frustration that&#39;s bad. That&#39;s why road rage happens in traffic jams when people are going nowhere. People are not stressed when driving down the highway at 70mph.It&#39;s the connection with Allah that takes away the frustration because you know that He is the one behind what&#39;s happening. So you do your best, make dua and come to terms with your reality. And that&#39;s called Tawakkul.AlhamdulillahYawarP.S. just heard her last closing comment about chasing meaning. That&#39;s what I wrote about above.

Gosh!! It&#39;s easier said than done. The pace in her speech is stressful. When one stresses with the cold sweat, heath heart pounding and triggering arms, what else could one possibly think and do? 

Bravo!

Belief is important part of removing my stress..Thank u for your speech! It is greatly good information to live without stress^^

she is so smart! :-)

Her voice stressed me out.lol.
what if u are very stressful but have no one to share to ?or in the other case even after sharing you are not relieved?

Love it 

professor mcgonagall

Very interesting point of view. Nice speech !!!

Am just 14 and am watching this...Yep

Excellent! I love this lecture and this lady!

Yep - most useful TEDtalk so far. Also enjoyed her book on the Willpower Instinct. Like her congruence and sincerity too. And less than 15 minutes. Very cool.

I love what she said and the way she said it.

Good one

Thank you Kelly. :)

This woman is amazing!!I&#39;m in love with her!

Amazing! Amazing!!
Blown away, very helpful. :)

Definitely one of the most helpful TED talks I&#39;ve ever seen, bravo!

cause of deaths ??? where is alcohol ?? tabaco?? 

One of the BEST TED talks ... 

So that&#39;s how it work :)

Excellent:-)
excellent way of tackling stress

@lifeincolour09 you can beat loneliness by volunteering and help people and being a positive person in your community.

Stress, is resistance to ???

It&#39;s not stress at all that kills; it&#39;s the resistance to stress. Resisting, what you need to feel; is the killer. Together with the fact that, it&#39;s never the situation; but rather how we think about the situation, that is the known silent killer that stress gets the blame for causing.

we all can agree that this talk is really interesting, but the studies shown in it are really really sketchy. especially when they talk about the risk of dying on a 5 year term. its ridiculous.

Recognise stress as your body&#39;s way of preparing you for a challenging situation, and create a life where these kinds of conditions occur as you care for others and you can stay healthy and happy. 

Stress is more manageable if others are not creating conditions for it to manifest in you.  (We&#39;re talking objective conditions of deprivation and involuntary or ill-compensated labor, not subjective tests in laboratories.)  If you haven&#39;t power to transfer your stress to others, or avoid it entirely -- a prerogative of a mere fraction in most societies -- then pervasive, persistent stress remains dangerous to (a) your future well-being in society and (b) your life. Few people get to choose whether they will or will not be worried about stress or suffer its ravages. A more responsive, involving, humane society would not force people to deal with stress.  No matter how &quot;helpful&quot; you think stress is, if it does not change your material conditions, such advice is ultimately futile.

Epic

A learning experience, was unaware of Oxytocin hormone or neurotransmitter played such a part in blood flow to heart, and I guess eventually reducing oxygen rich red cells to brain which uses 20% of our blood supply.

She is too much for TED

omg...love this!

I would.

Thank you Kelly, the truths in your presentation have raised my self-awareness, and brought me closer to my destiny

I&#39;ve been working on this premise, and I&#39;m feeling like I got into a rut I can&#39;t get out of :(

How to make Stress your Friend???There are more and more survival tricks available! The offered one in this &#39;Talk&#39;, to see &#39;stress&#39; as positive, seems to be the most sophisticated, when limiting the symptom &#39;stress&#39; just to reactions of ones system, that then one can manipulate. - Instead of asking about the <b>real</b> reason. Not just the reason that conditions and happenings are NOT what one want these to be, but the <b>root</b> reason why one is reacting negatively and is producing and accumulating STRESS! Isn&#39;t it astonishing that nobody is asking? Why not? Because that would need to question oneself and ones established mindset. That must be avoided! As it would touch ones personality in ones survival need...Yes indeed, it is possible to make &#39;Stress Your Friend&#39; in a real creative way! The basic condition for this is, that one is conscious at the moment  when stress is caused, - by <b>being aware</b> of ones reactions on the different levels of ones system: Body, mind and emotions. Then asking oneself, why one is reacting. Having accepted and integrated the information,  that stress is caused, when conditions, situations and happenings are NOT what one wants them to be and  so not fulfilling ones expectations. The next creative step would be, to be aware, what ones expectations are and the next, what has caused these. Also knowing, that we are all conditioned by our education and from the  common established social mindset. Then one might realize, that the real reason comes from there and NOT from  the outside condition one  encounters and  that is forcing ones automatic reaction. So one can realize, that one is trapped in ones own mindset like wearing a straitjacket, NOT being aware of it at all! Now ones stress reaction gives the opportunity, to find out about it and then one has the option, to hold on this established program or not, being able to <b>free</b> oneself. In that way &#39;stress&#39; can help effectively in ones personal <b>growing</b> process and  so of course is ones <b>friend</b>!

In my opinion, stress can help PROPEL you to focus on what is important.

Whether stress is good for you or bad, I&#39;m pretty sure that hanging out with this woman would be a drag. 

Wisdom at it&#39;s finest.  I highly recommend Willpower Instinct.  Reading her work in conjunction with taking a Mindfulness couse has radically altered many aspects in my life.  It&#39;s helped me understand and breakdown the motivation/reasons behind why I do what I do.

i bet taking care of a dog/puppy can release oxytocin

Is it possible that in 43% of the people stress causes or is caused by physical damage and that is co-related with mortality rate?

I&#39;m so happy I found this video today. Just to think a few hours ago I was crying in my car from an anxiety attack caused by too much stress. I feel so refreshed. I can handle it. Just have to stay positive :)

&quot;how u think about stress matters&quot; personally i can&#39;t wait experiencing a stressful moment,, studies showed that stress is the other biological face of happiness and courage....

Why people who believe stress is bad for their health die more? Perhaps those beliefs occur because they actually experience health problems? So ofc in the end, those who believe will be more likely to die. It is not because of their belief, it is because of their health condition that leads to the belief, that leads to death.

To my friends

She&#39;s smokin!
A wonderful reframe stress and how it&#39;s effects. Our minds are so powerful and it&#39;s great to hear the science behind it. Love, laughter and kindness estinguish stress and that&#39;s very comforting to know :-)Smiles from The English Sisters in Rome 

TED change my life

this talk changs my life! Thank you Kelly!

Kelly McGonigal i really admired with your talk....

Very good i coney my frients too...

wow i needed that...i almost died ...

Is that Bill Gates in the crowd at <a href="">4:06</a>?

Oh, great, another Kelly McGonigal TEDTalk!Said nobody ever.

This talk is probably the most beneficial topic in human existence, thank you for sharing.

SHTRESS?

Amazing. Thank you.

Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

How to turn stress into a power that drive us forward is more important. I always belive that we have the ability to deal with stress and keep goingThx for sharing this vedio!

Wow!!! This video is just amazing!!! How cool

&quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort , go after what creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows &quot; , great advice ..... cheers to stress :-)

this is incredible! 

Hearing about Oxycontin being called the &quot;hug hormone&quot; suddenly explains why I&#39;ve seen two UFC fighters immediately hug and embrace each other right after a brutal and bloody punch up. They&#39;re under immense physical and mental stress during the fight and instantly respond to the hormone the second that final round ends

GENIUS (and hot!)

Awesome talk.

Yes！ It is what you do believe that matters!

<a href="">#stoicism</a>
Very interesting talk. Dealing with stress is important for your health, and conscious awareness of your autonomic nervous system responses can be helpful.

Awesome information. This goes along with those who find the good in everything seem to live longer.

A very informative TED Talk on quite an integral issue on the lives of millions of students all around the world. Many students would certainly benefit from seeing stress as a positive thing, as opposed to negative.

Great video!  However, this reveals another gigantic problem in society, the response to people under stress.  Abuse victims, among others, are under a lot of stress and no one responds to them how she states people should.  Blaming the victim is huge.  So, which is worse, being victimized or society&#39;s response?  Victims of rape; child, domestic, financial or elder abuse, these people are under a lot of stress.  I&#39;ve been there, I know what I&#39;m talking about.  You do absolutely need contact, support, comfort and understanding; you need to tell your story.  You don&#39;t get it, you don&#39;t get enough.  You&#39;re told to go away, not listened to, told you&#39;re lying, making it up, too depressed to deal with, you caused it, etc.  There is every excuse possible to refuse to give abuse victims what she says people need under stress.  It&#39;s awe inspiring as well as death defying the insurmountable amount of unrelenting stress society dumps on abuse victims, EVEN if you go to a church &amp; THIS IS THEIR JOB!  Abuse victims have a high rate of suicide and drug abuse, not necessarily because of the abuse, but especially because of the social response to them as victims of abuse.  Look at all the kids who are being bullied and cyber-bullied that kill themselves because even when they tell someone no one protects them, no one does anything about it, and speaking out may make it worse because they will be blamed for it.

awesome just freakin awesome ! thank you ! 

The placebo effect strikes again

You&#39;re amazing. This is amazing. 

A good speech I think,when I think of the things assigned for me, I always feel nervous and stressful,I never give me a belief that MY body is prepared for it!Just what we think,not what we do~

Thank you for such a wonderful topic. As a student, it is really helpful information for me to fight stressful situation. It is really our minds that controls ourselves, our body reactions, and our responses to our environment. I just really do hope I can be able to apply it soon! I want a stress-free life! :)

This is immensely helpful! Thank you for sharing.

Another great bio-hack. 

did anyone else get stressed watching this &gt;.&lt; ?

A little stress also help your immune system stay strong. Ever notice how all these softies are always getting sick?

When I&#39;m stressed at work, I actually get alot more done. It gives me that sense of urgency.

What a fantastic talk! Beautiful reframe.

this video is actually a stress reliever :D :) 

just remember the god&#39;s name your stress will be terminated. Hasta la vista baby!!!

So if i dont stress I can live forever?  Why is this lady out of the kitchen! 

wha?? what did I do?

Touche!

how do we make stress as a friend?

Best speech

I love her confident and her fluent talk.

lol hey :p

Haha. Hi Ann
That means being lonely is the most stressful thing in the world and exacerbates the bad effects of normal stress. Basically that means I&#39;m dead.

Stress is my best friend :D &lt;3

Gracias
Beautiful Kelly, Thank you x

Jane McGonigal, Kelly&#39;s twin, is also amazing!

thanks for letting 20,000 people die. Hope your stressed out right now!

Great topic, very interesting to view stress in a different way. I will try it and see if my blood vessels stay relaxed. I like oxytocin already, need some more of it! How do I get more oxytocin? I love the biology of courage!

I&#39;ve known that for years!



fat ppl, being fat does not kill you; however, believing ur fat will. so, all u big boned ppl, enjoy ur lard latte. 

I personally believe that your attitude towards stress changes the body&#39;s response to it. But I wonder how all those studies linked cases of (premature) death to stress and not other causes. Also, caring for others reduces the negative impact of stress? How do you measure these things and account for environmental or genetic factors? Not saying she&#39;s wrong, just seems awfully difficult to prove such things. If someone could shed some light on this I&#39;d appreciate it. 

Ok, but what about cortisol and the aging effects of stress. ie, grey hair, wrinkles, looking 55 when your 30, etc. 

I don&#39;t like to put it in these words, but the simple fact is to just get over it. Get over it by knowing that things do and will get better if you let it. And once you let things get better, they will get better. Take this is from someone who has been through it even if it was only mild.

You have it completely backwards. Read some psychological studies before you make an assertion.

love the way she says &quot;Straess&quot; hundreds of times in this video

I really enjoyed this presentation #Superb

she&#39;s beautiful ! 

I wholly agree with what she says.but what i want to talk to you is the stress that harms our body is extremely  hard stress like someone you love so much passes away and you get lots of stress, which harms you to get other disease like cancer,hyperpiesia or stroke. Stress which people always gets is not harmful. You should be cautious about harsh stress not daily stress.

its logical...u dont need references to test the authenticity of this idea...the point is to accept stress, at whichever level, and diminish it by mentally letting go of the source of stress...

Yup, feels more like a propaganda.

Is it possible to get the references to the studies cited in this talk?

- Peace comes from the inside

- social contact is good for you

Seriously, thats what you found out?? This is what asian cultures knew before internet existed. Cant believe that this is sold as smth new. Only if science explains smth with nice animations you can sell it to the mass nowadays. Everything else is being stated as nonsense. Anyway, its a tiny step in the right direction.

Wow, so that&#39;s the answer to ppl who keep asking me &quot;How the hell you can keep that kind of schedule?&quot;

I didn&#39;t know the exact reason until now: when I started hearing my heart beats and noticed that I took alot of deep breath, I knew I&#39;m gonna quit and I keep breathing in short sequences and focus on my heart-beats and think to myself &quot;Let&#39;s -feel- (not imagine nor recall) the moment I can complete this&quot;. 

With this new knowledge now I can do more stupid thing for longer period of time!

Stress is like.. super healthy! :p 

I feel better already
This goes beyond mere corporate propaganda into life itself. Have you ever lost a loved one?  The way stress resiliency works according to the speaker, is through connecting to and caring about others. Those who had tragic events such as death in their lives did far differently through caring for to others, to reiterate. When she spoke of job performance reviews and negativity, she talked about our response to that. Some of that stress comes from not communicating and not taking it personally.

Well there is a vast difference between regular everyday stress and unnecessary forced stress.  One involves changing your life if you&#39;re working in a setting that causes you that much stress...the other...is just life stress.

Thanks you very much for this incredible inf

I really enjoy watchign those videos. Anyone knows where and how to attend a TED show ?

Oh... I read this as &quot;How to stress YOUR friend&quot;. Only noticed when she didn&#39;t give me any advice on how to to that...

It&#39;s a far more practical belief system than one that encourages avoidance.  Avoidance simply does not work.

I believe that stress is needed in your life. It makes things interesting! Keeps you alive! But like most things, in moderation. I think a lot of negative stress is the dangerous type. It just depends on what the individual calls negative stress. One persons negative stress is another persons positive stress.

that which does not kill us makes us stronger

How are you reading that?

Time to toughen up, then!

i am stressed 24/7, even while sleeping. want to know how i know that? every five months or so i will brake down and start crying uncontrollably for about ten minuets, two minuets later i will go into adrenalin withdraw and be completely exhausted, to the point that walking down the hall feels like a mile jog, for the next few hours. for the next few days i feel great, having such a low level of stress, not being on the verge of crying all the time and she is saying its all how you see stress

and she has a twin

Sounds like someone got paid to create this coporate porpaganda...Of course small amounts of stress are good for you, but the levels of stress working in corporate America are way above the normal and helathy. Good try though

The public at 8:43 found the &#39;snorting oxytocin&#39; remark to be very uncomfortable...

that&#39;s really a very meaningful and inspiring closure.

what doesn&#39;t kill you makes you _____

Is this bull shit to just trick you in to not getting more stressed about the fact your stressed which in reality is a problem and it&#39;s better to learn how to meditate and remain calm, than pretend stress doesn&#39;t affect the body. I think the best solution is learning how to deal with stress. And ignorance doesn&#39;t work. Best solution is to just calm down by focusing on something happier. Anger helps rise to the occasion stress causes damage anger is not stress. Anger is getting passionate.

Or recognise that people live and spell things differently to america.

Pounding... Physical...
In British spelling plough is correct.  American&#39;s spell it plow.

Probably just another generic and unimportant statement but I have to say...She...is...beautiful.

i think thats her first positive quality

From a personal standpoint this is really comforting scientific discoveries. (as scientific discoveries often can be). One thing i&#39;m wondering is that when taking into account how little our brains has evolved since the rise of homosapiens, we must also have some anxiety and stress trigggers that are in someway obsolete? This is only a sudden thought, if anyone could give a reasonable answer please feel free to do so :) 

This is an awesome speech!

Very integrative information.

stress becomes food for our mind if persists for more time. Better to divert your or colleagues mind if understood that you or he is under stress.

stress develops in our body is due to our attitude toward the situation. To avoid stress change your attitude toward everything around you and find out when you can walk to keep your selves healthier.





Talking about stress made me stressful

The oxytocin thing she mentioned could be a great help; talking with a psychologist might yield more personalised advice though. Panic attacks can be overcome with regular appointments, caring relatives/friends and sometimes medication. CBT could be worth a look too. 

So, if my calculations are correct then watching this video and learning how to handle stress has a 43% chance of saving my life.

wonder how this pertains to someone who takes panic attacks...like me.



fantastic
Wow. Rarely, veeeeery rarely do I add the smorgasbord of waffle that is the Youtube comment section, but this talk has inspired me to forego my natural instincts, and embrace the stress involved in such a risky endeavour.



Bravo Kelly. This is wonderfully awe-inspiring work, I feel changed already. Thank you.

I&#39;ll remember that name: Kelly McGonigal. She did an amazing talk. This is life-changing.

good 1...



that&#39;s why depressed people don&#39;t life as long as happy people, why people in social relationships live longer...

mind blown again

Messy hair?  It&#39;s wavy and she&#39;s beautiful.



excellent: the best communication of Biblical stress management I&#39;ve ever heard.

I love how she says &quot;body&quot; like it&#39;s a secret

basically no... she is saying to not stress about stress, and to think of stress as  a good thing.

Intention creates reality

I agree.  Poor research base...certainly not enough to make such sweeping generalizations.  The discussion about hormonal/endocrine influences itself is skewed: oxytocin has negative effects as well, and believing you can &quot;wish away&quot; the serious hormonal effects of prolonged, intense stress is not the same as being optimistic about short-term, minor stress.  But...I&#39;d have trouble taking anybody seriously who gets on stage for a professional presentation with messy hair and painted on red pants.

He would have thought that a gaming channel could bring me here. Thanks to davidr64yt for liking this vid.

Wilson, think of this as the beginning. Not the end.

I wonder if her mother was a professor at Hogwarts

The social stress test sounds just like my school and I believe many other schools in the world.

Great talk - but I find her dynamic presentation skill probably even more remarkable than the topic of discussion itself.  Her demeanor and commanding delivery are inspiring.

Here&#39;s a little exercise to build in this skill so it is you habitual way of reacting to stress. 



First you have to stress yourself out. Think of things in your life that do are can stress you out or make some up like having to find a million pounds to pay of Johnny the knife or he&#39;ll cut you up good and proper.. 



When you feel the stress then know that it is a really good thing as you have just seen and feel the good feelings flow through you.



Stop. shake it off and repeat many times. Habit!

&quot;Go after what creates meaning m your life &amp; not live trying to avoid discomfort.&quot; Interesting.

Its a good explanation

Thanks for the info, but I still need to find a deterrent for choking caused by anxiety.

As a panic attack sufferer. This video has helped me out a lot! Thank you

perfect summarysation if that is even a word

Apparantly, the placebo effect applies even to stress.

Researchers who fail to differentiate between &#39;stress&#39; and &#39;strain&#39; are missing something.  Stress is a survival response; but mostly for immediate physical threats &amp; is released w/ an appropriate physical response.  Stress responses to non-physical threats of modern life might not be beneficial to survival.  Prolonged, unrelieved stress to the point of strain is a different issue.  The MOST stressful situation is being held responsible for things over which we have no control.

LOVED this presentation, Kelly.  As always, your talk was insightful, compelling, humorous, and impactful.  How true it is that what we THINK and then choose to DO matters!!

we should snore oxitocin to make us more compassionate :D

Peter Weyland: We are the gods now. 



The more we put our trust and confidence in ourselves, the more we realise it will fail us. Because we are imperfect beings. Sad but this is the truth. Dont believe me? Try it, you&#39;ll face it sooner or later. We should only put our confidence in the Creator, not the creation. What I see here isnt anything new, it has been preached through the bible thousands of years ago. 

Ahh wonderful, the reply button is borked too. Now you can&#39;t see the stupid pharma advert that i was originally responding to.

YOU CAN POST THIS COMPLETE BULLSHIT BUT I CAN&#39;T POST A FUCKING CARAT NEXT TO A GODDAMN PARENTHESIS WITHOUT BEING BLOCKED FOR ASCII ART??? FUCK YOU GOOGLE!!!

a belief is all it takes

4:07 you mean? no, that&#39;s not him :-)

She should be in Hollywood

Not sure if I believe this but I have the feeling a good proportion of stress and its effects are brought about by concious panicking. Being able to tell yourself that this is NOT a bad thing probably alleviates some of the impacts. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to go searching for stress after watching this video, however. 

on the studied she mentioned people who believed stress is a bad thing had a 30% increase risk of dying and people who helped friends  had no stress related increase risk of dying. 

she is saying stress is not a bad thing, it only harms you if you believe stress is a bad thing, you can have a lot stress in your life but if you look at it as a good thing like your heart beating faster to pump oxygen for your brain so you can think clearly then you are going to be just as healthy as people with non stressful lifes.

Wow I feel like she bought her &quot;Speech&quot; at the Store!

Very fascinating. This study is Biblical. Jesus already pointed those things out. He asked us to do it!

Thank you so much Ms. McGonigal.  I have spent a lifetime believing that my body was undermining me, when in reality, it was preparing me.  What an amazing thing to actually trust yourself!  To trust the response!  During part of your talk, I had such a reaction to this awareness that I did that sucked in breath thing you do during a really sad movie.  Uncontrollable sobbing.  Wow, thank you.  Life really just shifted.

&quot;And then they checked the public record to find out who died&quot; Ohh that punch line just cracks me up.

Dem red pants

can anyone give me a conclusion of what she said? I have troubles understanding English. But what I have learned is that positive thinking of stress is the key,and thats mentally. so the question is that what is the biological effects of thinking of stress positively?

Great way to look at life again! Thanks!

I listened to this again for 2 reasons:  The talk, and her voice. 

&quot;How to make stress your friend&quot; After watching this talk I get how puny this is.

they are twins ;)

Whole new outlook on school

lovely talk.

8:35...lol

Wow, she is SO awesome!!!! I think her advice is super helpful!

Yeah man this website here is just sending out free White Apple iPad 3&#39;s for today only. 



You have to be fill out your address but it is all real, I claimed mine just before. Get in quick! UPAD3.COM



I can&#39;t be a cream puff.

In the face of the new case of Ethel Anderson, I would like to reinforce in this post that applied Psychology is dangerous to society. She didn&#39;t even recognize her mistakes. It&#39;s absurd. 

Mindset and belief is beyond powerful. Loved that gem, &quot;Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort&quot;. And WillPower Instinct is a major game-changer! Thank You.

Okay, sorry, but this will be my last response and I&#39;ll keep it quick:

1. Yes, there absolutely are people working at solving the root causes of problems.

2. If a system was created, it can be destroyed/fixed/etc.

3. No one in the U.S. thinks that banning guns will stop crimes.  Most do understand that it will decrease the number of gun deaths and total number of people dead from crimes.



You have a lot of learning to do, little padawan.

This is the last time I&#39;ll respond to you, because it&#39;s obvious that the only way that you can change your SYSTEMIC problems is if you actually see that there are a lot of people who are working towards the BETTERMENT of humanity.



And with my company, I told you to stop ASSUMING you know EVERYTHING.  Do I think my company will fail?  Yes. ABSOLUTELY!  If it fails, but changes the system, that&#39;s my goal.  Profit isn&#39;t.



And capitalizing CERTAIN WORDS doesn&#39;t help your argument in any way.

Hmm...  That&#39;s a difficult one.

Usually if someone&#39;s a student or an old cynic, they&#39;ll understand more about how the system actually works, but will be judging everything with at least some knowledge.

This person seems like they have only seen YouTube videos or read conspiracy theory websites and hasn&#39;t actually read any books or talked with anyone intellectual on the subject.

Here&#39;s the problem in what you&#39;re saying:

What says that a company has to chase profit?

I&#39;m using funds gained from other things to dump into my company because I&#39;m almost certain that it will never make money. If it makes profit, it apparently worked well.

I&#39;m living off nothing to save up everything so I can put it into my company that doesn&#39;t care at all about profit.



The problem is that not everybody follows the strictest rules of everything.  You should stop assuming you know everything.

First, there&#39;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with a company making a profit.

Second, the more people who try to do good, to change the system/the way the system operates, the more it will actually happen.



Do I believe that my one company can change everything?

Do I believe that donating to a homeless shelter solves the problem?



No way!  It would take a huge effort by many, many people to make any change.

You should actually look into the organizations that are trying to fix the root causes of homelessness.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Oh, wow!  You are truly the delusional one!

I once met a guy that said that because all of the corruption he saw in and around the UN, he decided to stop trying to get into the UN or similar organizations.  What the speaker at the event and I said to him was, &quot;Doesn&#39;t that make you more motivated to enter?  So you can change things from the inside?&quot;



Bringing vegetarians into this? You don&#39;t understand that companies do respond to decreasing sales.  Less meat = Less production

A young naive economics student, or an old cynic?

Wow the part at the end about chasing meaning

This has really changed my outlook. Such an inspirational piece that many of us can relate to. Thank you for the courage to speak about this Kelly. :) 

I like her, she looks very sexy

It is so informative that shows how statistics has changed sciences. 

Bill Gates at 04:07.

Laugh it out big man! How many people have u stressed out like this :P

You know what...not out of anger towards you or dislike for you but in order that you actually experience reality i do hope you do have some devastating financial reversal with no one to count on. This will be good for you. Did you know that Prince Charles when invited for tea at the White House was given a tea cup and a tea bag ( strange but true u would think loose tea would have been served)...i saw the video Charles was looking at tea bag had no idea what it was. True story. think about it.!

karma taught me a lesson, i would not wish this lesson on my worst enemy not even you, but perhaps karma will do or whatever will come after you. I pray not. You will then know that learn the same lesson i did and you will not like it. I sure as hell do not. And i was just like you with this poor woman who really did not have TEN dollars...this could only be a lie from what i knew of life. I know better. I hope you spend your money on sensitivity training before you learn the hard way trust me .

You shows such lack of compassion as i once ad..I did a favor  some woman i met online. I was living in Italy &amp; all i asked from her´send me a Mitchem deodoran, cost about $5 tops. with postage less than $10. For me NOTHING. not sold there. sure she would do this. she didnt.. I got really angry. Outraged. I had done her big favor. she did not follow through on such a tiny amount. She didnt have $10 to spare, impossible 4 me 2 believeI was as rude and insensitive to her as you are to me here.. 

I told you THEY alway change the story on you! Mind over matter is the cure for everything! Embrace all your flaws and hardships to empower yourself or perish!

I am not interested in wealth. I am NOT money driven. I simply cannot understand how since 9 April i have had 2 sales one 9 April the other 31 July. I am aware that those w/o having experienced such a situation which sounds so unreal naturally can only conclude the person is doing something wrong or other negative thing.. We see homeless ppl we all get uneasy &amp; naturally see them as less than human not easy to look@ them. Me too. I understand u. impossible 2 convince me till it happened to me.;(

i agree &amp; so do several acquaintances that something is wrong. but i cant figure out what is  wrong, &amp; no one else can, no bad talk on internet not one negative comment only praise. business savvy acquaintances successful people, who are focused on business success who see what i do w/ target market passionate ppl who love what i offer but what i over is better  sound is unique and so superior to anything out there, my site is great, this is THEIR assessment. happy   hypnosis  dOt OTg u tell me 

Surely this should be labelled as &#39;how to cope with stress via change of viewpoints&#39;? I didn&#39;t get the impression that it made you better than if you had no stress at all. ie you can recover from stress but it isn&#39;t going to make you superman.



i fell in love a little bit

You&#39;re doing something wrong. If it&#39;s true that you&#39;re highly educated and you&#39;re not using booze or drugs, and you&#39;re working 16 hours a day, YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS LIFE POSITION NOR BEING YELLING AT THE TOP OF YOUR KEYBOARD LUNGS AT A VIDEO HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH WEALTH.



Please, go cry somewhere else. Keep on feeling sorry for yourself if you want to stay in your current life situation.

sorry you live a half century not live half centering i cant stop sobbing for the guilt and helplessness of my most beautiful friiend my girl kitty who saved my life when i went from riches to rags this change ...money that when i had more than anyone needed and spent in and meaningless things and if i needed a of course it never occurd to me that this was not t a normal natural human right...i am not on drugs or booze or anything and highly educated and high intelligence sill cant make 1 ct. Y

 4 u  live a half centering as a comfortably middle class person notone who can afford  art or big diamonds or a lear jet but  no big financail chalenges u u take vacations u do nor live from paycheck to paycheck like a drug addict who thinks only about how to make it til next fix aka paycheck, you overnight go from riches to rags &amp; ur beloved cat is ill &amp; vet says u pay 2000US upfront or ur cat will die &amp; no credit. cat u love all u have. u take  cat home &amp; watch  cat die. u go nuts true story

I AM REALLY BEGINNING TO HATE TED TALKS WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED IS TARGETED FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN AT LEAST A FAIRLY COMFORTABLE WORRY FREE FINANCIAL SITUATION : I KNOW THIS BECAUSE SPEND THE FIRST 54 YEARS IN A MOST COMFORTABLE FINANCIAL LIFE AND NOW I AM SLUMMING BUT THIS IS NOT SOME GAME:::THIS IS FOR REAL:::I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD LAST I FIGURED IT MIGHT LAST A YEAR::IT IS NOW NINE YEARS AND NO MATTER HOW HOW HARD I WORK 16 HRS A DAY I FAIL FAIL FAIL AND I KNOW U ARE NOT THIS WAY:

THEN WHY WOULDNT YOU WISH MORE STRESS IN YOUR LIFE SINCE IF YOU GOT THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IT IS THE BEST THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE IN YOUR LIFE:::IN ALL WAYS! I am NOT BEING SARCASTIC FOR I AM NOT NECESSARILY DOUBTING WHAT YOU SAY BUT THEN CONTRADICT WHICH BLOWS APART YOUR WHOLE TALK WHEN YOU SAY THAT HANDLED THE RIGHT WAY STRESS IS TERRIFC THEN IMMEDIALTEY SAY NOT THAT I WOULD WANT MORE STRESS: EVERYONE IS SUCH A FUCKING HIPOCRITE CANT TRUST ANYONE : 

whoever takes her home must have all kinds of good  stress

Helping people is great unless they turn out to be moochers and users

Anyone that was intrigued by this talk should look into Bruce Lipton&#39;s work.

I guess you are quite an idiot.

There are certainly organizations that are not interested in profit maximization, such as homeless shelters, co-ops, etc.  There are also many companies (but a very small percentage of all companies) that do want to make profit, but only after they have a positive impact on the world.

I created my own company in order to make sure that I won&#39;t work for a company that is aimed solely at making money, but I&#39;ve found many organizations that only want to help.

Ppl believe anything a Ted speaker says. Ahahahahaha.  Put an MD up there buddy.

Nope, it is allready known as &quot;nacebo effect&quot; GIYF

They are twin sisters.

&quot;believing&quot; kills, no news there

What is stress i never was stress...I guess i mean what is this?I take life easy and thats it...

Wooooow!!! Changed my life!

thats one of the most insightful quotes i&#39;ve ever seen

Hi - nobody fits anywhere and 99.9% of people end up in jobs not connected to what they really wanted / studied for etc, but they have fit in and are making an impact on the scene - please never say you don&#39;t fit in - you will and it ALL depends on what you think of yourself. Have self respect and self esteem - not bordering on arrogance and there you are - fit in sung..anywhere. They say &quot;Stand up and dance  - do it naturally - make up / prepare your mind- that&#39;s all...

Definitely related to Jane McGonigal.

Dang this is one of the best Ted talks I&#39;ve heard. I would&#39;ve never linked stress to health in this way

good way of thinking!

I&#39;m trying to get rid of stress not make it my friend.

Just look at the low-fat diet. It&#39;s complete bullshit.  

internet is not the same as real life buddy

This talk gives me bad stress. I am extremely shy so I don&#39;t make social connections. I&#39;ve gone volunteering for the last 3 summers because it&#39;s the right thing to do but many times I felt very anxious because I didn&#39;t quite fit in. So basically I can&#39;t make stress less harmful.

Bill Gates 4:05



this video needs 7 billion unique views and the world would be a better place :D

Great speech, loved it! :)

&quot;placebo effect&quot; has a whole new meaning.. and science backing :)

I just expect this to turn into an onion talk. 

First please define what you mean by stress!

1433 years ago....  we believe in your conclusion... you did good job :) thanks for hrlping people to release themselves and become healthier.

God messenger (prophet) Mohammed PBUM said, only Kinship and good neighborliness building home society and increase the ages.



Come back to your first state of mind, the truth of all .. the faith of jesus and mosus... Islam

One of the best talks I&#39;ve ever seen!

I find this brilliant, nothing wrong with a positive and relatively new outlook on something that originally creates so much negativity in ones life. Nice job.

Hope*

I defiantly needed to hear what she had to say. I how she knows how much and how many people she just helped

stress make you social

Love Makes anywhere Beautiful ( Work -Home )

The problem is the opposite The Hate  ( Work OR Home )

Saffron from Firefly?

let me guess you have a phd to prove this right? 

I knew from the moment I heard her voice that she would be making a compelling pitch that has no validity in the world of reason and science. I seriously suggest you ignore every single word she says beyond seeking loving social interactions to better your health. Everything else is a wishwash of opinion. Or shall I say, &quot;withwath&quot;

I can see, in certain circumstances, this technique being borderline dangerous. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll write a book on it and make millions.

There is never gonna be peace on the internet.. doesnt matter your educational level... it&#39;s always gonna be there...

Is it wrong if I rewatched this just to stare at her face.

...



I don&#39;t usually post but I applaud the attempt at simulating high stress levels in the comments. XD



Although I think the comments anywhere on this site are a good place to start. ;)

she spent 10 years talking shit about stress, now she&#39;s gonna spend 10 more years talking more new shit... she clearly doesn&#39;t understand the very nature of stress, and saying that stress will make you more social... are you kiding me? nobody likes stressed people, you can feel the stress, it spreads, and tricking your mind into thinkig stress is good for you is just masking the problem. it&#39;s like closing your eyes and ears to become ignorant and pretend everything is just fine.

Hey, let&#39;s end this. This is getting weirder and weirder. Just ask for my forgiveness and you shall receive it.

Awwww. You&#39;re at the phase of the argument where you desperately grasp for anything to insult someone with....which is typically spelling errors. A sign of insecurity...because you know you&#39;re digging a hole for yourself. Revealing your weakness with desperate, petty attempts is just more digging. Just stop.

I disagree!

Slow down, you&#39;re digging to fast.

Oh yeah, then after your criticism-immune brain is done with the spinning, you say &quot;nice try&quot;. That&#39;s gotta be some kind of projection. Thanks for amusing me, for now.

I&#39;m impressed by your ability to spin. In your mind, it&#39;s not that you are so transparent that I don&#39;t need to write an essay to refute you, it&#39;s that I&#39;m just degenerating into thoughtlessness. Any legitimate criticism of you can be interpreted(again, in your mind) as a failure of the person doing the criticizing. I wonder how that has worked for you in life. You do it so well that it must be a honed skill.

The fact that you would jump to such a specific guess about who you think I am reveals way more about you than it does me. So, keep digging that hole.

How about no. Try caring for 40 needy bitching residents and not have any stress. I help them everyday and my stress only increases. Sounds like bullshit me.

life begins at the end of your comfort zone

I don&#39;t need to type a paragraph to demonstrate that you&#39;re a pretentious, hypocritical idiot(and now someone else has pointed it out). You make it that easy. But, nice try ;)

She killed so many people over the last ten years.

You called Sina a Schmuck. Indirectly isn&#39;t that the initial problem you raised? You stated your own opinion and based on your ideologies you became a hypocrite. 

I said WTF because the statement was surprisingly inaccurate, I said &quot;NO&quot; because the statement was wrong. I said &quot;CERTAINLY&quot; because I was certain, and I still am, and again, I see you raise no point about my comment, and only want to somehow prove that is wrong by saying it&#39;s driven by emotions. The driving force of a discussion is independent of its content. 

lol

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t imply that, you&#39;re inferring that and you are wrong.&quot;



&quot;being emotional about facts can only ever result in twisting logic and manipulating truth&quot;



Interesting cognitive dissonance. You&#39;re a joke.

Not stress, but maybe duress, if it was stress, I would play chess, now I take my leave &#39;cause this page is a mess.

What pretentious bullshit.



You implied that being emotional means you are going to be irrational or inaccurate about the facts.Then you get called out for it and try to pull some bullshit about you just meaning &quot;factual&quot;...as if that is even a meaningful point.Then you ironically end it with &quot;nice try&quot;. You&#39;re a fucking weasel.

What if my stress has nothing to do with a pounding heart? I don&#39;t feel like this covers a lot of aspects of actual stress.

this information will change my life. thank you!

I can&#39;t say anything about that but SHE talk about stress  and you guys talk about hell i know stick to the title &gt;&lt; 

Thank you for a new perspective on stress management. I have always believed that what you think is powerful.  I have taught classes on stress management and this gives me some new ideas on the topic.  I enjoyed hearing about current research also.  

Great comeback, you&#39;re like an angry child.



Come and talk when you can actually squeeze some worthwhile issues out of your arse, because at the minute the only thing you&#39;re communicating is excrement.



Take a look at yourself for a minute, read back your comments - and rate yourself from 1-10 on how self righteous you think you are.



If you rate yourself any lower than 8, you&#39;re in pure denial.

Yeah, I did know actually, at what point did I call you a woman?



&quot;nice try&quot;, there is no trying, women spend a lot more time on their appearance than men, maybe that has something to do with the fact they get more &quot;comments&quot; on it than men do, why does it always have to be about SEXIST PIG MEN.



I tell you what, if all men suddenly stopped complimenting women on their looks, we&#39;d get a new feminist movement focused on bashing men for &quot;not caring&quot; or some BS like that, can&#39;t win.

Who reading these comments are feeling stress? Now are you gonna make a good thing?

Thank you Dr. Mc Gonigal, for sharing your very interesting and inspiring work on stress response!

Well done...
Did you go check it? doubt it. Not sure where in the world men are systematically discriminated against. Yes I would criticize a woman if they commented on a man&#39;s body when they are presenting a talk (not sure why you think I wouldn&#39;t, because you love believing that I hate men? even though I am one?), and there is a huge imbalance here, women get comments on their looks way more than men do. Yes the guy responded me and I replied, so what?

first paragraph: WHOA nice try did you know I&#39;m not a woman? I challenge you to compare the number of comments on women&#39;s looks in educational videos, not sure what I&#39;m being sexist about.

second paragraph: Usual old rants about how women want more than they deserve and all that crap, sure women are having the best time ever. Ah shut up.

There&#39;s a difference between finding someone attractive versus commenting on their ass in an educational video. I know it&#39;s easy to be an idiot...but stop it. No one said you can&#39;t find someone attractive. Dumb fuck.

If a white person objects to a &quot;harmless&quot; racist comment does that suggest they must think minorities are inferior and weak? 



Shut. your. dumbass up. Think before you speak.

Too sum it up. My point is the new pro-women laws are very one-sided and they arnt even fulfilling the needs of those the laws are supposed to help because of it many men such as myself are &quot;afraid of commitment&quot; and afraid of settling down because the moment they do, they enter a prison in which the only escape is death. Women want handsome men but they dont want men to look for beautiful women. Its one sided. Women should be judged by their looks. 

Make a point or stop wasting comment space, kid. If someone tried to chastise a woman for being attracted to a man they&#39;d be protested by a 200 person march. Men aren&#39;t allowed to find women attractive unless the woman actively, personally consents. THAT is sexism. That is a double standard in favor of one gender at the expense of another.

How about you learn something first? Go visit any Men&#39;s Rights website or channel and educate yourself. Because men like women. You wouldn&#39;t chastise a woman for saying a guy was attractive so why aren&#39;t men allowed to be attracted to women in your delusional world of false victimhood? The guy even responded to you and shut you down for your false dichotomy. As if you can&#39;t appreciate someone on multiple levels.

Another dude living in a bubble telling me to &quot;look at the big picture&quot;. Ridiculous. Ignorance alone is annoying, but your arrogance combined with ignorance is just fucking disgusting.You have no clue what you&#39;re talking about. What other topics which you know nothing about would you like to educate me on? Fucking dumbass.

Every human on this planet judges people by looks, would you go to a job interview in dirty clothes? without shaving? No.



You&#39;re calling someone out for doing something which is biologically encoded into everyone on this planet, it&#39;s impossible to not take someones appearance into a personal judgement, maybe you should take a look at YOUR failing, because you clearly haven&#39;t got a clue, like so many of the other &quot;bad&quot; feminists you get screaming on the internet.

Ask yourself how many times you&#39;ve heard man being called &quot;sexist&quot; for complimenting a womans appearance.



Now tell me how many times you&#39;ve heard a woman be called sexist for complimenting a guys appearance.



People like you ruin it for everyone, you&#39;ve gone absolutely insane with perceived entitlement, look at the big picture and get off your high horse, you know nothing about sexism if you think someone saying a chick had a nice arse is being &quot;sexist&quot;, you make me sick.

The only one being sexist here is YOU, women comment on how guys look all the time if they are considered hot, and not ONCE are they bashed for being sexist.



Feminism is pathetic, women want equal rights but they also want the perks of being seen as a &quot;weaker&quot; gender, chivalry, exclusion from hard work, women get special treatment because they are &quot;delicate&quot;.



I&#39;m sick of feminists like you whining all day on the internet because you think the female gender is entitled to more than they get.

I love the concept of chasing meaning and changing your story about stress.

This made me cry. Amazing.

Lol. Keep repeating some dictionary definition like you know what it means. To understand why your attitude is sexist, you have to understand the wider cultural implications. You don&#39;t because you live in a little bubble like an little ignorant child...like a child that says racial slurs without understanding their larger history and cultural contexts. Then when it&#39;s explained to him, keeps trying to dodge an education by spouting out dictionary definitions. Enjoy your ignorant little bubble.

Don&#39;t have stress in the first place. Then it&#39;s your best friend.

Yay stress!   :)  when im in meetings and i feel my heart racing I&#39;ve realized it because im getting ready to share something i feel is important.   :)   it use to scare me, and i use to view it as negative and anxiety based, but not any longer.

this isn&#39;t totally applicable to everyone. in this talk, she makes the assumption that all people who are stressed are stressed from external factors and not internal ones. for example, people with depression experience consistent stress so their bodies are in constant fight/flight mode, which is what causes all the health problems often associated with stress. 

So you&#39;re being a dudebro on the issue of sexism. This is just a game to you, eh? You should know, modern sexism is a complicated and difficult issue to articulate...and because of that, it is extremely easy to strawman. Which is basically what you&#39;ve been doing in your debate game. So have fun doing that bullshit.

Wow, so powerful
What are you even saying? I prefer high divorce rates to domestic violence, &quot;women aren&#39;t happier&quot; source? And what is even your point?

Okay so how does a talk about stress invite all the bible-thumpers, feminists, and basically all of Team SJW to the comments section? I think there are new laws of probability on the internet in effect here...

as apposed to what? The brilliant divorce rates and family dysfunctions of the present? Women arnt happier. Their deprived and so is everyone else because of the abolishment of the age old reliable gender roles. Hierarchy is important. Humans are social animals we work in cooperation to better the lives of everyone. Not to use a power monopoly to further the position of certain individuals in society at the cost of everyone else. Looks for resources. Something for something.

Wait... so ultimately, it is your mindset or belief that makes stress a good thing, or your stress response a good thing. But stress (too much of it specially) is still harmful. 



It&#39;s the mind over body mantra again.

Lol. You end your comment with &quot;nice try&quot;, after trying to make a disingenuous point. Hilarious irony.



You can have a conversation about facts and be emotional about the facts...stop being a fucking idiot. That was the original point. Not &quot;what is the definition of fact?&quot;....which is what you tried to shift the topic to and pretend to make a point. Nice try.

It helps blacks and minorities when white people speak up against racism. It doesn&#39;t matter that it doesn&#39;t personally affect them(actually, it affects society on a larger scale). Are you suggesting that it would be racist for a white person to speak up a against racism &#39;cause it implies that minorities are weak?



Get some perspective and stop being a fucking idiot.

I didn&#39;t say the fact that I think it&#39;s my duty makes me right, and even comparing my stance to that of WBC&#39;s or people against marriage equality is wrong. There is an issue, and as I&#39;ve mentioned, it is female eduacators getting a disproportionately large number of comments on their looks in educational videos. And you contributed to that.

they are identical twins



Is she the Sister of Jane McGonigal? They look a like a lot.

Stress didn&#39;t kills you, it was the mindful of stress kills.

Really helpful!

Again, I see you raise no point, and, as I said, there is nothing wrong with a discussion being driven by emotions, and it CERTAINLY doesn&#39;t make it wrong (or right). I see you responded to my comment and claimed that my comment is emotion-driven rather than factual, again, if you think there is something wrong about the subject of my comment, speak, if not, I see no reason to answer your comment, because it&#39;s boring, has no point, and wastes my time.

2. You are (consciously or not) contributing to it.

3. I&#39;m just expressing my opinion on a comment which I find sexist. Sexism is not just an issue for men, it&#39;s an issue for all the people, and the duty to stand up against it is for all of us, not just women. I  objected to that comment because I found it wrong, not because I felt that women can&#39;t stand up for themselves (which is a bit of a stretch in reasoning to claim that I did so)

Very helpful presentation on handling strees

A truly fantastic talk.



Her pants look awesome with the carpet where she is standing.



This is a cool video!! BTW check this video out with super models Guess What We Gave The Models it is so funny and hot!!

Obsession with security, pursuit and comfort is a surefire way of making you stress out. 

the pharaohs believed that stress keeps men alive, in hindi it says&quot; nafrat manush ko zinda rakta hai . hats off to you... i am stressed much and its my power to stay alive

2. One of the attitudes based on backwards views of roles of women in society is that their main role in the family is to take care of children and please their husband, which results in the view that a woman&#39;s looks is very important in qualifying her worth as a human being. So yeah it does have to do with men&#39;s attitude towards looks.

3. Actually people do have the right to be pissed off when they see something wrong. And the fact that I&#39;m not her or that I&#39;m not a woman shouldn&#39;t matter.

Yeah I see you have no point, except a meaningless discussion about what &quot;factual&quot; and &quot;fact-based&quot; mean in this context which really isn&#39;t the point. Don&#39;t bother replying.

Excellent talk about stress
So that&#39;s why girls live longer

I wouldn&#39;t call your comment sexist but sexual objectification of a woman.



the problem is that someone has assumed you are a man objectifying a woman and implied sexism..

but for all we know you could be a lesbian, in which case your comment wouldn&#39;t be sexist at all... 

Muy interesante

WOW I just found out that Kelly and Jane are TWIN SISTERS!!! I already liked them separately but WOW. I wonder what has made them both so wonderfully awesome in such similar ways?!?!

Objectifying yourself would require thinking of yourself as an object. Even women who dress provocatively primarily think of themselves as people, not as sex objects. It&#39;s the men who look at said mode of dress who are objectifying them.

&quot;How you think and how you act (about stress) can transform your experience of stress&quot; that seems buddhism, we are thousands years late, but we are starting to getting it. 

I liked when she gave five points to gryffindor

okay, let me see if we can end this discussion in a rational way and break the general way that discussions on youtube go. Let me start by asking this: 1.do you agree that women on youtube generally do get more comments on their looks on videos that are unrelated to their looks? 

2.Do you agree that in a sexist society men pay too much attention to women&#39;s looks?

3.And at least do you understand the sentiment? Can you understand what pisses me off?

Being emotional and being fact-based are not mutually exclusive. Now if you have a point, say it.

Where on earth did you get that silly idea?



Tell that to the salmon that, having reached the spawning grounds and done their thing, die almost immediately due to the stress levels in their body that drive them up waterfalls. Open them up and they are riddled with disease and organ failure due to their body&#39;s having to endure prolonged highly elevated levels of cortisol. Prolonged stress interferes with the immune system, cell reproduction and repair, gene expression, reproductive processes, etc

You are right... i have been in stress. And I&#39;ve taken support of my friends to get out of my stress problem. And somehow, this has been the happiest time of mine with my friends. 

stress makes you live longer.

stress compounded on stress = more stress

Therefore, stressing about stress that stress is stressing your life which already has enough stress as is makes you live infinitely long

You guys look a bit stress XD 

You guys look a bit stress XD 

Stress is good. It makes you a better person. Pressure, challenge. But you have to know when to relax and let go. That way you have both ends of the spectrum.

&quot;I&#39;m not commenting on it everyday and constantly.&quot; didn&#39;t say you did, just that it&#39;s done frequently. &quot;How did you come to the conclusion that half my attention was her body?&quot; because it was half the subject of your comment at least, her talk, her ass.

And yep, consciously or not, it fits in the first one. Your attitude toward this woman is based on the traditional view that women&#39;s body is an important thing to analyze, important enough to be the thing you comment on after watching this video

Nice pants!!!
you should work with the team i work for....by friday  evening my head humming born free ....come monday morning i sing the the theme song of roots....kunta kinte .....

When these &quot;innocent remarks&quot; are added up everyday and repeated constantly. And paying so much attention to women&#39;s body so as to consist half of your attention in a talk about stress (judging from your comment) is sexist, especially when considering that women on youtube receive SO MUCH comments on their looks rather than their content.

im speaking as a guy here, and sometimes, i will admit its hard to pay attention to what your saying if you are attractive, and especially if you all are wearing something that sparks our imagination, if you get me there. sorry ladies, but guys do this a lot

Revolutionary idea &lt;3

This is Jane McGonigal&#39;s twin sister, who has given TED Talks on the psychology of video games. They&#39;re both amazing people.

Sina, isn&#39;t another confused logic about freedom? If you believe men have feelings as well?

first two videos: curious social experiments, not sure what I&#39;ll be judged about. third has nothing to do with &quot;man-hate&quot;, just a funny decision made by a judge, nothing gender related. the fourth is a report on a study. all others are educational videos (if you actually bother to watch them, which I highly recommend) in none of them women were objectified or sexualized, and all are honest, intelligent, non-vulgar discussions about human sexuality which is an interesting topic. nice try.

as another male I would be offended if I was talking about something I&#39;m passionate about and after I&#39;m done talking someone says &quot;coll! and nice body!&quot; because wtf I&#39;m talking here. And I&#39;ve seen many comments analyzing a woman&#39;s looks in educational videos and it is certainly not the case for men. And it&#39;s bothering. Because very often people don&#39;t like their looks to be analyzed when they are presenting something other than their looks.

I love the idea but i&#39;m not certain I&#39;d trust the study she refers to - surely its possible that people who said they experienced a high level of stress but that it wasn&#39;t harmful weren&#39;t actually experiencing as high a degree as the people who did think it was stressful? They have better coping mechanisms by percieving it as less stressful therefore are less stressed? Stress isn&#39;t quantifiable unless they took cortisol readings over a period of time...

well then in that case that would be stressception

So ty TED for saving my life in the future. (I love the combination of grammar and gamer slang in my comments)

Oh, you think pointing out sexism is *real* sexism because it implies women are weak. How original. Christ...do you have any other dumb gems to add to this conversation?

&quot;You&#39;re a monster&quot;. Lol. You&#39;re a fucking idiot. Step outside of your little bubble. You&#39;re trying to tell people about *real* sexism when you don&#39;t know shit.

Thank you so much! I get stressed always and this will help a lot!

Very profound...I LUV it

search &quot;benevolent sexism&quot; which includes far more &quot;benign&quot; things than saying a woman has a nice ass. condemning men for having emotions? You demean the word &quot;emotion&quot; by calling a &quot;nice ass&quot; comment an emotional one! What exactly are the male problems you are talking about? are they systematic? And how exactly am I adding to them?!! Go learn something dude.

If you stress about being stressed then you compound the stress; you&#39;re adding stress on top of stress.



Seems obvious really.

But god forbid a man have feelings about a woman! God forbid a man have biological urges or impulses! Men must walk on eggshells around fragile, weak, helpless women so as not to distress them!

And the people who claims women are THIS weak are somehow on the side of women? How can you claim women are strong and empowered and respectable then demand that they be coddled like children constantly? How are they not the ones being truly sexist here?

Prove it. Prove that correlation. Because I doubt it exists. And it&#39;s still not causation. You&#39;re a monster. People like you who demonize others at every chance. That demean males just for being human. That condemn them for having emotions and urges. If the same were done to women you&#39;d be on the street banging pots and pans. But you&#39;re used to ignoring male problems, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re happy to add to them.

70 people aren&#39;t stressed



Thanks for this. Really interesting.

You know the relation between music and dancing is very different than the relation between ass and a talk on our attitude toward stress, the main difference being that the latter two are unrelated. The fact that the top comment was about her ass worried me. I rarely, if ever, see anyone commenting on a male&#39;s body when he is in giving a presentation. But I see LOTS of people analyzing a woman&#39;s appearance when she does. And I see that the top comment is contributing to this imbalance.

No, I am a man, except I&#39;m not a sexist fuck like you. Imagine what would happen if she was greeted with that WONDERFUL compliment after the talk. It is bothering to see that the top comment on a video about stress is a comment on the presenter&#39;s ass. it is fucking bothering to see men who think that of all the things they saw in this video, what&#39;s worth commenting on is her ass.

WTF NO! It&#39;s because of the social pressure coming from MEN that some women feel they need to wear revealing clothes. And you know people don&#39;t wear clothes for YOU to look at, people very often just want to look good, and sometimes for example it&#39;s FUCKING summer, and the only way to know if a woman wants sex is to ask them, not infer it from their clothes.

Thank you kelly!



Wow, this was something! Great thoughts!

I&#39;m happy that what His Holiness The Dalai lama and Tibetan Buddhist lamas has been teaching and sharing their experiences about compassion, altruism and sense of concerns towards others makes people more healthier and longevity is finally accepted and followed by the world over especially the scientist, psychologist and scholars. Some test on Tibetan lamas were done by brain scanning their compassion meditation by scientist and it confirms that compassion makes people healthier and stronger.

People like to show what they got , when she was fat no ass was given xD. watch?v=lfBpsV1Hwqs



Really good video. change my mind about stress.

Why are they laughing!!!!!!!!!!

Good

I needed this.

Objectifying people based on their sex is sexist especially if being objectified was not their purpose. We cannot know what they are thinking, but it&#39;s certainly shallow to judge people by their appearance.

 

You are in no way claiming her intelligence is in anyway dependent on her gender or appearance as far as I know. I understand that.



Comments on appearance can be left unsaid because people come here for the message, not the appearance.

Ironically, you&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t.

Our male-centered culture over-prioritizes a woman&#39;s appearance. This expresses itself in numerous ways and has negative consequences for women. These basic facts are something you have to know to understand why commenting on a woman&#39;s ass(especially in this academic context) is a reflection of our sexist culture. And you have to consider how that makes many women feel. It takes empathy and a willingness to become culturally/socially educated.

What about you all shut up?

So you cannot listen to women because you&#39;re horny,

and you don&#39;t expect others to listen to them either?

I think the word you&#39;re looking for is horny.

&quot;Great talk and great ass.&quot; means nothing more substantial than

&quot;Me like talk. Me horny.&quot;
They think they&#39;re saying a compliment and are confused why you take offense and take it personally.



If they really like the talk itself, the like and favorite button would suffice.

No, you CAN! god why are people so sexist!

No they&#39;re not, but I don&#39;t see any person commenting on the looks of a male when he talks about science. Her ass was not the subject of the talk. Just imagine what would happen if you told her that in real life after the talk.

No I don&#39;t, it&#39;s things like these, that make sexism &quot;okay&quot; or trivial, there really isn&#39;t a fine line between a sexist joke and and beating one&#39;s wife, it&#39;s all coming from a certain kind of sexist point of view. Pointing out sexism doesn&#39;t trivialize it. These &quot;benign&quot; acts are very often correlated in societies with more violent acts. sexism is sexism, no matter how &quot;benign&quot; it seems.

Wonderful talk. I think she has quite a talent for public speaking.

mmmmm......I wonder what Sapolsky&#39;s Beard has to say about this?!

gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.

nope, her twin sister
This is Mind- blowing and very very logical... thought of it while dancing with a girl I met for the first time. I first felt the stress, and the adrenalin pumping but I remembered this talk and saw the stress as my body preparing ...you know ...for sex . The stress went down and I never felt more relaxed with a grl

is the same lady who said video games are good. I think I&#39;m in love with her.

because the body signals for stress and excitement are very close, we can trick our minds to believe that stress is actually excitement. It is only a matter of how we choose to perceive those signals

I appreciated this but I was like, &quot;this girl is kind of stretching believability, saying she&#39;s taught about stress for 10 years when I know for certain she&#39;s called herself a game developer only last year!&quot; Some wikipedia&#39;ing later, I see that she is part of a set of identical twins.  TWO brilliant McGonigal sisters.  I think I now have caught on to their separate &#39;looks&#39;.

Wonderfully put! I love this! It is a great reminder on how we perceive things!



Everyone who dislikes this video are obviously stressed. lol

I handle stress by smoking weed.



Is Kelly McGonigal related to Jain McGonigal by any chance they look like they could be sisters!



she&#39;s hot. other than that, its about mind over matter folks

to not have any misconception - i don&#39;t say that stress is good nor bad although i do have a position of making stress go away as soon as possible or to make strees for making myself overcome cognitive difficulties to come through pre - disposition 

but we need to creat a whole picture of stress and things like that,the all or a whole oriantation of what we are doing or we can do whille we are stressed

sure it dosen&#39;t show everything about stress but it shows that the pre - disposition we made is overwhelming but one data source that stress is bad because of...  that is true but is not the only data we have to know about stress,we are makng statements about a thing from one source that shows not too much

yeah.stress kills but we need more than that to know all the picture of what is stress 

i&#39;m a one guy that hate stress yet i use it sometimes and sometimes edvocate it 

So boring. 



She&#39;s hot though, so after muting the video it was watchable. 

Quite so. What&#39;s bad for you is constant up/down stress responses (the kind of stress response caused by challenges/denigration/whatnot in the workplace/schoolyard), either by your boss, or by bullies; normal stress responses (deadlines) are fine. The problem is caused by the fact that your body tones down its immune system during stress, because it thinks it has to allocate energy to fight/flight responses; if those occur constantly, the downtime becomes too long and diseases/ulcers can form.

You cheapen the real meaning of sexism when you misuse the term to apply to something so petty and so benign. People like you throwing the term around left and right are the reason there&#39;s a huge anti-Feminist backlash these days.

Because she is not here to show off her body, she&#39;s here to talk about our attitude toward stress. Is that what he took away from this talk? All he learned was that she has a nice ass?

This might be old fashioned of me, but I refuse to pretend that stress is positive, just so it wont hurt me as much. I&#39;d rather eliminate stress where I can, and enjoy the natural health rewards for that.



The fact that the placebo effect is real does not mean that we should eat a sugar cube every morning while convincing myself it&#39;s a special vitamin pill.

Yep. Another &quot;science&quot; about stress of last few decades is devalued by the same science. Then they want to trust science. There is just too much stuff around and you cannot possibly spend much time clarifying.

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re being funny or sarcastic. Either way, she clarifies &quot;PREMATURELY&quot; at 2:32 in. Sarcasm is only funny when you&#39;re not taking someone completely out of context.



The TED talks have become long and boring...

This talk was making me stressed. And bored.

How is this sexist? It doesn&#39;t say anything about her gender. It is a comment about her figure. 



Excellent!
looking good farah abraham 

watch?v=7CbCCgQd904

You can be a difference in Psychology, you question yourself, read and listen. I appreciate that. 

I&#39;m subscribed to Vsauce, although I didn&#39;t watch all the videos, many are about the brain. Good call.

i&#39;ll tell you some more fascinating fact, you are talking about &#39;dying&#39;

I read the experiment.. Very sad.. I read a little of the APA Ethical Principles, although purely private conduct of psychologists is not within the purview of the Ethics Code. It has arguments for a more objective good at the beginning, stating: &quot;As used in this Ethics Code, the term reasonable means the prevailing professional judgment of psychologists engaged in similar activities in similar circumstances, given the knowledge the psychologist had or should have had at the time.&quot;

She prefaced that it was based on the amount of stress experienced in the previous year. So she&#39;s saying that they had a 43% increased chance of dying in the year immediately following the experience of high-levels of stress.

really helpful information, thanks!

The current top comments include a sexist one and a stupid one... I hope things will get better...

Needed to hear this today

every college freshman should watch this.



I would do her.

thank you for this video. 

Check out the Yerkes-Dodson law.



Not enough stress and you won&#39;t do anything. Too much, and you crack. There&#39;s a happy medium.

Fascinating. Thank you! 

I&#39;ve been to a couple.  While I was in college, I decided that it would be a good idea, for various reasons, to go in for sessions with my university&#39;s counseling department.  It wasn&#39;t helpful because I didn&#39;t have the vocabulary or sufficient self-knowledge to discuss my situation and my counselor didn&#39;t have objective tests with which to collect data.  We were trying to make omelets without eggs, and it could have easily lead to an improper diagnosis if I hadn&#39;t gone and done research myself.

lmfao, +10 points to gryffindor. I&#39;d share some oxytocin release with her!

Inspired... Learnt... THANKS :)


very interesting. certainly to bear in mind...

The idea that your mindset about something can affect your health is an idea worth spreading, actually I can&#39;t think of a more prevalent one from any TED talk I&#39;ve ever watched. 

Really good stuff.

I think this can also apply to believing that industry manufactured or processed food is harmful to you even thou it is done with acceptable standards ....( sometimes it maybe harmful but even more harmful when you believe that it is harmful thus leading to vicious cycle)    

I&#39;ve read your other overly generalised opinions, you are misinformed and ignorant about modern psychology. 



Modern psychology has changed since the years of Jung and Freud, its not completely free of junk but many portions are now following the scientific method and are completely validated.



You claim to have a degree in computer science and yet you can dismiss neuro psychology along with the entire branch, a scientific form of psychology that treats the brain as a computer.

It&#39;s a little disturbing how even TED talks chronically keep under representing minority women. Progressive policy is to give a voice to the underprivileged. Yet, the very women in society who still suffer the most from pressures of conservatism and who lack upward mobility and financial independence the most are, time and again, being sidelined in favor of upper middle class white women.



It&#39;s the year 2013. Something about this mentality is truly worrying from a progressive point of view.

Here you are wrong! :D
Stress isn&#39;t the cause of anything, it&#39;s a symptom. A symptom of what, is the question. 

Basically, don&#39;t stress about stress, or you&#39;ll be more stressed and have more of the negative effects of stress. Wen you&#39;re stressed, don&#39;t stress about being stressed, and you won&#39;t be as stressed.  Also tell someone you&#39;re stressed and youl&#39;ll feel better.

This is what I refer.. Don&#39;t experiment too much.. What Kelly McGonigal did in the talk was an experience. Be objective about the good of the person, to be serious at each and every step, about the good of the other. A psychologist, a medic, an engineer can ruin a person&#39;s life. Then later say, &quot;oh go to someone else&quot;. It&#39;s not acceptable, at all. Take it seriously. Be rigorous. We don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s the psychologist responsibility to be good. Just like everyones.

this is complete utter bullshit and highly pseudo 

Wow I didn&#39;t know Jane McGonigal had a twin sister.

I wont go into the problems with today&#39;s peer review system.. I noticed and read the abstract, still the collected data doesn&#39;t imply the results. The abstract resumed the paper, so it should make sense by itself... Don&#39;t believe me.. Ask a teacher of Biology or some other field, that&#39;s very respected. Send one or more emails, it&#39;s easy to do. 

If you&#39;re not going to do good, then why are you going to do this action to someone? Does the person know what she is receiving? You need an objective definition of good, even if it&#39;s not complete. If it&#39;s not objective, it can be bad, it shouldn&#39;t be done(at least the probabilities of failure must be known). Maybe this is the biggest difference of Psychology with Engineering and Medicine. It&#39;s hard to find objectiveness in the mind. Complete subjectiveness is the way? The world seems more broad

I had a discussion with a Psychologist before about good being subjective.. Is the mind different from the body? If I take the heart out of the body, it&#39;s bad..Is there a equivalent in the mind? Like simulations, ideas. That you put in, or take out. Can we shape the mind, do good to a mind? Maybe this is another revolution that you can do in Psychology, the other sciences can also be viewed from the subjective and objective.Inductive and deductive.The world can be understood by these two methods

It made me very nervous.. Maybe this is what Psychology lacks, and you can make a revolution in the field. What I mean by rigorousness is also the certainty that what you do, will be good for the patient. If it wont be, just send him elsewhere. It&#39;s the obvious. Just follow this, and you&#39;re good. :)

TED was great for expanding scientific knowledge in the general populous, but TED is failing if the ideas that it spreads are unsupported or presented as valid theories when they&#39;re really just hypotheses in early stages of testing. Saying, &quot;we don&#39;t know and we need to carefully study this, but here is our hypothesis&quot; is much less exciting than saying &quot;look at your misconceptions!&quot;  Chris Anderson is going for &quot;wow&quot; factor, so I think we can expect more poorly presented science in future talks.

I say all these things because my life has been really damaged.. Actually, I hope to do Psychology and be very rigorous, as a good solution.. But I am not God.. You people can help too. I just hope you understand my cause. I said in another post, Psychology is one of the most needed fields, this goes to the good of the field, just don&#39;t do bad things, and be rigorous in research, open to other sciences, that&#39;s all. You fight against this? You fight against good? Why? Read. Be good every time.

Not all is, but much of it is pseudoscience. What it is, is not the problem. The application is the problem. I mean, don&#39;t play with people&#39;s minds, like she did in this video making everyone nervous, this is bad. You understand? The rigorousness in the field is needed too. I don&#39;t know. I hope you do good to people and don&#39;t close yourself inside Psychology. 

Whether psychological studies use scientific practices as stringent as those used in physical studies is a hard debate because of the massive difference between the two fields.  What can be said about this talk is that, while the story is fun and the revelation is astounding, the supporting data that she presents here is either lacking in substance and qualifiers or is lacking in existence, which makes me (and, apparently, other people) highly suspicious of the conclusions that were presented.  

All by psychologists. As I am talking about a problem in the field, your argument that it&#39;s scientific does not hold. I have read a part of the Wikipedia entry on the Scientific Method.. The part on Falsification, and the difference between Induction and Deduction were specially interesting. They too include the definition of testing.. I really urge you to do only good to people, I say this almost crying.. 

You mean the guy who died? The guy who is STILL dead? The guy who people debate ever lived in the first place? That guy?

I&#39;m worried about the future of TED.  Chris Anderson doesn&#39;t put up about 1/4 of the talks from each conference claiming that they don&#39;t have &quot;wow&quot; factor (see his Reddit interview) and that future speakers attempt to beat the performances of last year, meaning that each year we would get more &quot;wow&quot; factor.  But, &quot;wow&quot; factor isn&#39;t good science, as this talk proves.  Attempting to shock and awe an audience into cheering applause starts down a path that leads to the History Channel.

this video just made me afraid of stress because I don&#39;t get any social contact.

She&#39;s so Pretty.........

Great comment.

I do hope I open as many eyes as possible, that Psychology is a field like Medicine, or Engineering. It needs rigorousness. They have all this insight in the mind, but they bully our minds.. To a strong mind, maybe this is not problem(to me it became a BIG problem after some months, I became very egoist, she told me that doing good to humanity is a waste of time, Fucked my mind to this day..... Stopped working.... I don&#39;t want that to anyone). And they are supposed to treat weak minded people.. 

She probably meant dying early as opposed to dying old of natural causes.

ha!

O dear, another &quot;Biology of Belief&quot; (Bruce Lipton) supporting story on TED. Watch it while you can because TED likes to remove/censor these kind of videos. (i.e. Graham Hancock/Rupert Sheldrake)

She&#39;s hot!

This means I have a 143% chance of dying...?

Fuck all you with a only 100% chance! I hate you! Life isn&#39;t fair!

chances of death *within 8 years*

What is it about a single belief that has the power to control the thickness of your heart valves?

For the people out there that would find it hard to believe that stress is preparing you for the challenge ahead. I wonder if the belief that having the original belief also has a similar beneficial effect?

i get what you&#39;re trying to say. you mean the &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; response. its not about &quot;attack&quot; alone, but maybe running away. and to be more specific about what organs are inhibited, only the stomach and upper-intestinal action slow or stop.

I find what helps about stress really is taking every challenging task as a mission in a video game. 

she isn&#39;t.. 

What a great presentation. And omg what a nice voice does she have! So soothing!

13:41 - it&#39;s not hard to believe... if we take a sugar pill and think it&#39;s an anti-depressant, it has been shown that we react BETTER than we would if we took an actual anti-depressant pill and therapy together. The brain is pretty crazy and we cannot really understand it.

Yes but any thing that strengthens bonds intensifies in group bias. Just something you need to keep in mind and then the effect is reduced.

tell that to jesus

We need some more research on Oxytocin inhalers because at Stanford haven&#39;t been able to get hands on it as students. And it is a trust hormones, which you forgot to mention! 

^ I am with Frank on this one!!!! 

Holy FOOKING SHIT! That is wild. If this is some sound science. Man oh man that is some wild ass SHIT! 

7:25 - here is something to encourage your words more to others. How do we know it isn&#39;t to prepare us for action? Well it is to prepare us! If we see a snake, our body goes into sympathetic  nervous system dominance and prepares us. It shuts down most organs and increases blood pressure, so we can attack. 

4:00 - this was a Psychology study for people to get more comfortable with sharing their weaknesses and not get any feedback from them, because it is better to receive non-verbal than it is verbal. 

this woman is ridiculously beautiful.

Well, it might be, then it is going to be clarified in the future. It also can be the other way around: those who tend to think that stress is not bad, are just generally more relaxed and cope better with stress.



But what about vasodilatation instead of vasoconstriction during stress reaction in those primed with &quot;stress is good for you&quot;? This is quite clear result.

Hm, doesn&#39;t oxytocyn also make you more xenophobic?

Stress is good, unless you&#39;re stressing about being stressed...

that means when you have no other to escape from stress, beter enjoy it. haha. 

If i was dating that chick i dont think i could stress with those eyes of hers lips and hair... thats it ted science people start the cloning process we need one of her for every man! Thats my solution to ending world stress where is my Nobel Peace Prize?

ah she works with yoga and mindfullness :)

The chances of dying during that time period increased by 43%...

Beautiful legs.. The radioactive red really accentuate them too

No more urban farming videos from ted?

thanks for the explanation brah..

This is totally self-reporter bias and nothing else. Geez, some people brag about their stress.

Certainly those that think stress is not bad for them generally have stress that is not bad for them, like having to give their weekly presentation at the gardening club. Certain kinds of stresses like the feeling of being chased by a carnivorous animal twice daily, are not stresses that would be healthy for anyone.

(Two extremes but you get the idea.) This is NOT how science is done.

brilliant

*instead of running away... Srry.

Confront it. I wish someone had told me this before though, cripes.

I agree with her, I recently started adapting this mentality, where I realized that stress is everywhere, especially in today&#39;s times with the world and its problems and how everyone is watching everyone else, you have to accept the fact that stress is the reason why you are still here today, because it&#39;s all about survival. Plus, when she said she admitted to have been wrong about stress, it&#39;s just time really teaching you, that nothing ever stays the same, and better to run away from it, just

Too little evidence for the conclusions. The evidence is also weak, because there are too many other plausible explanations, such as that people mean different things when they answer about stress, and those that mean deadly things, die faster.

Go after what creates meaning into your life and trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.

(y)

Wow, this is amazing this should be shown every where and to everyone this knowledge can save lives .I&#39;m amazed.

They spelled &quot;Minerva&quot; wrong.

I am not the only one who thinks she is really hot and attractive 



Anyone else think she was her sister at first?

this video is one giant &quot;fuck you&quot; to high school health classes :D

Within a certain time frame.

haha - there was a study which showed 100% of humans died after they were born.



Sweet, taking correlation and posing it as causality! 

She is surprisingly hot for a female speaking at a TED conference.

Wait... Chances of death increased by 43%? I thought you will die no matter what.

If you stress about stress, of course you&#39;re stressed!

Bottom line is.. Don&#39;t get stressed.
I personally have begun to think there is a side to our mind which is incredibly stupid, and by thinking in the right way can physically change our reactions to a situation. This is not the first study to find out what we think dramatically changes how our body works. Think about this: you can program your mind and your body&#39;s reaction. It also fits into &#39;unexplained&#39; human feats like monks generating warmth with no clothes etc.

Wow, you know I went through this whole talk, thinking that this was JANE McGonigal! I only just looked at the name properly. Lol. I was thinking that it was odd that she didn&#39;t mention anything about video games! haha. 

uhhh
4:07 gill bates in a red robe.

So once more, what we believe about things actually shape much about our experience. Great to hear about scientific backing for this.

Children, I did not understand one thing that translates to me:(
lol

Amazing. Thanks Kelly!

lol

They send of their talk 2months before giving it and the information within it, are fact checked. 

Popped my... 

That&#39;s it! Enough of human interaction for today.

Law of reflection...includes belief systems

Umm this is very useful.

We just popped your cherry!

Eeugh...

...

...ok...

*tap* 

*tap*

Neither am I. Everyone hugs man, come on.

This is not useful.

Not all stress is bad.  E.g. exercise is a type of stress.  I&#39;ve always believed context to be highly important.  This video well touches on some of those key points - but definitely not precisely as I would have imagined or guessed.

Ok, man! I may admit some shortcomings. But I&#39;m still not a hippie! 

once again physiologists make common scene sound like a shocking piece of wisdom, sadly people actually pay them for this, lol. 

*hugs*

Definitely!

I agree stress can be used for the good. PAIN &amp; PLEASURE. Use stress to power pleasure and desire.

About evidence, it&#39;s very obvious that you don&#39;t know about the Scientific Method. This is what makes me most scared about Psychology. I&#39;ll read again the wikipedia entry for Scientific Method and search for some papers on it. I strongly suggest you do the same. 

Yeah why is it bullshit.  Not that I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not bullshit.  Just like to know why.

I have a degree on Computer Science. Published 2 papers last month. As I&#39;m criticizing the scientific aspect, I don&#39;t need to have a degree on Psychology, I just need to be a scientist to know about Scientific Control. Yes, studying the mind is very hard. I do respect Psychologists efforts towards research, specially Kelly McGonigal. All That I don&#39;t want is the application of Psychology in a bad way, I want you to be precise. As she said, doing more harm than good, is obviously bad for society.

You need some oxytocin

But the speech went WAAAAAAYYYYY better than I expected from the first 2 min! 

I&#39;m sharing it! 

Aal izz well... And &quot;Jadu ki zhappi&quot; .. :P
I can&#39;t stand her vocal fry! 

Here&#39;s the study she&#39;s talking about:

psycnet(dot)apa(dot)org/journals/hea/31/5/677/
Check it out and see for yourself.

I honestly believe this study with all my heart. I can&#39;t honestly say that I&#39;ve been in a lot of stressful situations in my life but I remember the few I have been in as some of my most enjoyable moments. I&#39;ve been cynical since a young age and always believed that my body wouldn&#39;t be a detriment to itself in tough situations That lets me tackle the stressful problems with a certain amount of ease.

Why no references posted?
Life changing..

Sound&#39;s like Daniel Moerman&#39;s placebo effect or meaning response. Change the meaning of physical response, change its effect.

Indeed. A pleasurable activity is stress? How do we change from stress to pleasurable activity? By having well defined goals, and having success, being good to the world and to ourselves. One point arises from these thoughts, the talk lacks determinism, also lacks a more complete vision on the topic. 

Everyday stress that we all suffer is something more prolonged than a temporary &#39;rush&#39;. Stressors like that project deadline next week or troubles at work causes responses (like higher blood pressure, dialling down immune system, growth etc.) that stay in our system for days and weeks, usually without us even actively noticing it.



Plus, when you are in bed, sleepless due to stress, telling yourself &quot;this is my body helping me rise to the challenge&quot; probably won&#39;t make things better.

Studies that pass peer review should not be so easily debunked.  Certainly not on YouTube comments.  That doesn&#39;t make the study valid.

The word stress should be defined at the beginning of this lecture as I think stress in one of the more badly used and understood words.

how about correlation is not causation? Maybe people who are going to die in the next year are more likely to view stress as harmful? There could be many reasons this could be true.

I expressed myself badly, I&#39;m deeply sorry. I meant applied. Research should be carried out extensively. 

Amazing unexpected end.
I have talked to many psychologists, I was secretary of the student directory of my university a year ago, talked with them every week.. I am open to discussion, she herself admitted that she&#39;s been doing more harm than good for many years, and you forgive her before she reformulates her perspective on psychology to a decent degree, just because she said something good after.

I&#39;m certain they should think before applying these techniques on people, I want everyones life better, and not worse.

I thought about the generalization I made, not all psychologists are bad. But a vast majority. There is no control. And this is a very important field. My life has being ruined by one.. It&#39;s hard not to be emotional about it. She making people nervous just for fun makes me scared, what are the other feelings do they make people feel? Should I laugh while they make me feel bad and make my life worse?

This is the beauty of science, takes raw data and changes how we view our world.  

Valken, how do you think scientific ideas are coming about then? If the movement isn&#39;t given to the masses or in a textbook or encyclopedia, how will it spread and be questioned?

That outfit is stressing me out.

I&#39;m buying anything she&#39;s selling

How old are you sir ??

Psychology should be a science before being given to the masses, this is my case. 

Ok, what&#39;s with all this hating on psychology? I expected better from the people watching these videos.

No idea who these people are, looking for eye candy at a TED Talk.



Personally, she&#39;s really not my type. She&#39;s not ugly in the slightest, but I&#39;m not really attracted to her. She reminds me a lot of an English teacher I had in middle school.



This idea, on the other hand, is awesome. The message of her talk, while set on flimsy evidence, shows a lot of promise. I /have/ experienced stress as she talks about it, and I do find that it&#39;s more damaging to me when I dwell on how much it damages me. 

Lol you didn&#39;t even reply to me. No grounds for action against my cause. That is, if you know my cause..

Yup

Why? I&#39;m wrong? Where?

Yes the experiments may not provide completely accurate information, but in a situation like this that may not make that much of a difference. What does it hurt to have a better outlook on stress? Yes, it may not reduce your risk of dying, but it doesn&#39;t hurt staying optimistic.

Great comment. A++

Please read my answers to other youtubers, maybe Solaris Heights. 

Indeed, you&#39;re right. I called her dumb. I should have called her dangerous and evil, perhaps. Because that is what psychologists are. I have seen much good in this world be undone by them, makes me revolted. 

Just what I needed LIKE LIKE LIKE

Yes, doing good for others. Making bonds. But this is very, very complex, depends a lot from person to person. And she didn&#39;t do a comparison with people who don&#39;t have stress and do social activities. Psychology is not science. They don&#39;t even use scientific control. I call this complete bullshit, what didn&#39;t I understand about the point?

The way this talk was done proves psychologists are bullies. This is no fun matter. They do a lot of harm to good, working people. Psychology should be banned from it&#39;s application to the masses. 

Peach, I can eat a peach for hours.

Great comment. Psychology is not science.

Psychology is not science.

Human connection?....well im screwed
well he has given 4 ted talks and one of them was within 12 days of Kelly McGonigal&#39;s talk.

This girl is so dumb it hurts. Psychology is not science.This is proved by her choosing opposite sides, stress is good or bad, without understanding the complete picture.Psychology should be illegal to be given for the masses until it&#39;s a science, and not a social experimentation done by people who know nothing about what science is, or how it should be carried out.Psychologists think they are superior, and worship psychopaths which makes them very, very lazy.And crazy.And I&#39;m being gentle here.

Beautiful 

I wonder if this &#39;oxytocin&#39; connection is why thrill seekers often seem very outgoing.

Whether it is or isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t undermine the logic of her argument. She&#39;s basically talking about what the top sports psychologists have started talking about over the last few years or so. How to perform under pressure.



They&#39;ve found that pressure is actually a performance enhancer if used correctly (ala michael jordan), the problem is that so many people are taught to try to shut it out that they end up choking.

she&#39;s cute.

I like how the whole basis of her talk is on two studies. One where we don&#39;t even know how it was carried out, how many participants, interpretation of data etc. Also her lack of defining between acute and chronic stress worries me. Still food for thought I guess.

She is pretty, il have to watch that again.

Thank you, you probably saved my life :)

As a high school bowler, this year has already been stressful for me, because it&#39;s my first year on varsity, and I&#39;ve been pretty stressed and nervous about screwing up. In my first game, I DID screw up...but I feel that I can use this to really benefit me next week in our next game!

Inspiring to find out compassion has biological benefits. Stress is good for you if you know how to channel it correctly. I&#39;ll meditate on this for a while :)



&quot;Chase meaning and stop avoiding discomfort&quot; Words of wisdom from Kelly McGonigal

increase risk or dying`? thought everybody died. 100%

&quot;A good mind is a lord of a kingdom.&quot; --Seneca, Thyestes

This talk is propably for people who can&#39;t just turn their stress off. 

Stress to me is the realisation of your &quot;loss of control&quot;. The moment when you notice something that screws with your plans, kicks you out of your daily routine or get&#39;s on your nerve but can&#39;t change. 

Just accept the fact that you can&#39;t keep anything under control forever. You can die anytime. You can&#39;t shield your children from everything harmfull. Anything you build up can break down.

Accept this and all Stress is gone.

I agree. To believe that stress is bad for you increases biological reactions that are not healthy.

To reprogram your mind to think about your body reactions as a positive thing, is the key part.

I see you&#39;re really stressed about Republicans. Try to change your outlook on that. It might save your life. Anyone that brings politics into a discussion that has nothing to do with politics is obviously stressed out. Now, go right ahead and start calling me names too. It won&#39;t stress me a bit. :-)

I like this and it makes a lot of sense and yes, she is pretty hot.

I find it odd that caring for others would help vs stress. For me it&#39;s the fact that I care for others that cause stress.

Sorry, but no, I think your conclusion is not what it means.

Stress reactions of the body are biological mechanisms to prepare the body for a particular situation, giving you more focus, energy and whatnot. If people are conscious about those positive effects, there are no increased fatality rates. (The part with the widened vs. contracted blood vessels.)

They&#39;re waiting for a microphone aficionado to do a TED talk
I&#39;d realy like her to define her understanding of &quot;stress&quot;.

2:39, the moment when her whole case becomes bullshit. spurious correlation anyone?

Yeah, you two have stopped watching TED yet the both of you watched this video. Please refrain from negative comments

I read the title as an awkward way of saying &quot;How to inflict stress upon a friend&quot;. Can&#39;t be unseen, and I have no clue why.

TED events are about $7500 per seat.

I wish TED would live up to its motto of spreading ideas that are worth it and stop posting bullshit. reporting dubious results of an ill-designed experiments - you could do better than that, TED :(

as slkdragon2 said this isnt &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot; make belief, scientist have know and studied the placebo effect for a while now

Stress is good. It serves an important purpose. It assists us in survival. 

A well-crafted counter-argument, sir.
So caring really IS a matter of heart!  ;-p

You may want to look up the placebo effect. &#39;Real&#39; scientists have been studying it for decades to figure out why it works as well as it does.

This video is great since I just started High school. Thanks, TEDtalks!

Oxytocin makes you want to be closer and more empathetic to those your care about, but it has the opposite effect on those who are unfamiliar. It makes racism and xenophobia much worse. 

i masturbate when I&#39;m stressed, thanks for the new material kelly!

That&#39;s bodily stress caused mainly by falling air pressure after the summer due to water becoming denser in the body. 

Go to bed in your jeans and by the time you wake up you&#39;ll feel great. 

This is bullshit.  Stess is bad, period.  

I *heart* redheads!!! yay! happiness.......and Wendy&#39;s lol

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason real scientists (physicists, chemists, biologists, ...) look down on the mumbo-jumbo non-fact based *thing* that is psychology. I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t scientifically-minded psychologists out there, but clearly &quot;Do A and feel good about it will make you healthy, yay! rainbows and unicorns&quot; cannot have much to do with actual science.

I too, noticed Bill Gates among audience. Makes me wonder how much entry to these events cost!

booody

This is why I stopped watching TED videos.

whats wrong with snorting oxitocin?

Coming from a person that has done experiments and studies like this, I can offer some insight into your comment about her numbers. Due to the natural error in any study, there will always be &quot;wiggle room&quot; in the final results. That creates a range of possible ways to present the information and round numbers are nice and easy for an audience to remember. I haven&#39;t checked Kelly&#39;s numbers myself but I see absolutely no reason to doubt them.



Great job Kelly McGonigal. I enjoyed this very much!

Best tedtalk i&#39;ve seen so far! Good job!
I think a lot of people in the comments seem to misunderstand her point.  It&#39;s not as simplistic as saying, &#39;don&#39;t stress about stress&#39; at all.  I&#39;m only a layman, but this appears to be a simple cognitive behavioural re-programming exercise in order to limit the effects of a stressful situation. 

THIS is what TED should be about, not that political clap-trap. 

Semantics and positive thinking aren&#39;t new. It stresses me that re-evaluating the obvious is seen as progressive by this trained scientist. It reminds me of how there is always some new diet plan; like we only just invented food.

So let me get this straight: Convincing people that stress is good makes them less stressed and ergo more healthy after experiencing stressing situations.

Either I understood wrong or this premiss is contradictory and what actually happens is you give a prep talk to people and make them worry less and THAT&#39;s what improves their response to stress situations. Stress is still bad but thanks to placebo effect people improve their stress response making them deal with it better.

A psychologist who has been saying what she learned at university for 10 years and doesn't see the results in front of her. And suddenly she read someone else's study and bam, she's already at the other pole. A man without stress will become a slug. Stress in certain norms is a hell of a necessity, otherwise we won't have to worry about whether we will have money to clothe and feed our children and we will leave them walking around hungry and bedraggled. And this has been known for a long time, it is nothing new and every normal person feels it with all their consciousness.
Very good talk. Thank you.

3. factor =&gt; stress resilience + more positive stress rating ?

I&#39;m stressed out about my social support structure, and then she tells me my social support structure will help me with stress.

really nice talk. 

very good thanks

i liked this. why are ya&#39;ll hating?

I knew this already for years. When I am stressy I perform at best!

Just looking at it or was there something you did that lowered your stress? o.ö

As far as I know, when stressed, the body releases adrenalin, which is good for boosting physical reaction, but restraining thinking capacity and focus, therefore relying on instincts. If you need to solve a problem with your brain, stress is counterproductive.



She strongly reminds me of Boudica. I am glad that I watched this insightful video. A large thank you to those that made it happen and available here.

if this shit really works, along with the prediction that stress levels are only going to get worse, just imagine the very thing that might have wiped us out now becoming a vital tool. stress has always been a part of life no matter the species but there&#39;s a reason your body goes into overdrive because of it, its a good survival method for any life-form 

lol

hope u did not get stress from saying that

she has the blood of innocent people on her hands

This changes everything...

the powerful placebo

that one guy stands.....hahahhhahahahaha

shitty presentation really, where is her backup data ? anyone with some time online could prob come up with that bullshit. 

This is a silly comment. It&#39;s true, but unnecessarily specific. The comment would be true for anyone with similar training / occupation.

No.

basically a more advanced version of the placebo effect

Read the comments. 

All of this can also be easily explained if you assume people are not good in evaluation in their own stress levels. Stress has multiple meanings. A busy person doing many fun things may say s/he is experiencing stress, but  tell that to somebody with difficulty breathing due to real stress.

The word &quot;stress&quot; is starting to sound odd to me...

I&#39;m converted stress can be good if I think it is!

Surprise! Chris Anderson teleports to the back of the audience at 14:21 from the stage! :-)

Stressing them about stressing about stress*

It&#39;s something you get when you have responsibilities.

I&#39;m going to go to work tomorrow and get me a whole bag full of stress.

Is that Bill and Melinda gates at 4:07?

like stress

She has a nice butt. That lowered my stress level. 

So, if I have a depression that reduces my oxytocin, I&#39;m still screwed?

I think she&#39;s talking about how people are already stressing about stress, and that&#39;s the worst part.

If you are ever annoyed or frustrated, you&#39;re stressed.

great woman
This talk WILL save my life!

If your biggest concern is deciding what you&#39;re hungry for and ideas for pranks to pull, then there is no hope in you grasping the concept of stress.

@optionsupdate &quot;let be&quot; and trust in your bodies ability to cope, its a common wisdom that is being rediscovered and repackaged as a revolutionary new cure..

It&#39;s a grammatical error, people do it all the time, but it&#39;s usually easy to tell what they were trying to say.

Da bodeh

Stress killed loads of americans, *everyone laughing*, very nice crowd.

She&#39;s kinda purrty
Shes cute.

It is as if she is trying to say, change your perception of stress.

Another great TED talk.



Stress is one of many things we humans seem to try to ignore or rationalise as an entirely modern thing, when it&#39;s really a realigned biological response to our environment. It&#39;s the fight-or-flight response adapting to its new surroundings and lifestyle. The more people try to ignore it or treat it as some kind of disease or negative condition, the more of a problem it becomes. Just like fear, you have to face it, embrace it, and learn what it is trying to tell you.

I was feeling stressed thinking about whether I was stressed or not!

is anyone criticizing her?

nope... you need to stress &#39;till the end... i have heart problems too... and they always come up on sport competitions... only then... now i know... why was i born with  less production of oxitocine? And i can confirm that since i&#39;m not very social and many other things.... thanks mcgonigal for telling me there is nothing i can do about my life :D

wtf?

Great now i&#39;m stress about changing how i see stress...

When i first read her name, i immediately thought, Professor Minerva Mcgonagall

this women may have inadvertently caused peoples deaths by stressing them about stress

I went to a doctor last year who told me I was under too much stress and I seemed to have heart problems despite my young age. After that, my life went downhill - I was constantly panicking because I was stressing too much, and because of that I lost my friends and my grades went down. I never realised there might be a link until now - Maybe I can finally relax?

I wonder if this is very helpful for people with serious anxiety problems or if its only really works for normal levels of stress people without conditions go through. 

I can&#39;t understand why people are critizing her. This is a very good talk.

I wonder who dislikes these videos and why?



The body requires stress, it&#39;s just the right kind of stress that&#39;s most important. For instance, when we find ourselves bored, or when all of our basic needs are met, we will create stress. …There is also the nocebo (conversely the placebo) effect to consider. We can cure ourselves and make ourselves sick, purely with our minds. 

Great speech and I love how there is only one fella who stands up to applauder first x)

Great talk.  

Is it just me or is she really annoying! Worst speaker ever!

Well that was depressing.... 





Sleep with me then no stress for me

Really insightful and rewarding to know. Just couldn&#39;t keep myself from focusing on some of her pronounciations hehe 

Graham Hancock

Well, now I feel guilty for not being under stress. Should I interpret that as a good or bad thing?

You are indeed pretty profound []  very  much more than pretty [] and to me you are an amazing and wonder filled speaker . You are the first HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST I have met since i became a psychologist in 1968.  

Ahmazing!
Anger is my friend, stress is just a bystander. :D

This was incredibly helpful :D

Good talk!



she is so cute so hot so horny mmm damn it!!

I have been demonizing stress all my adult life...this talk changes my mind. Stress is natural and I should use it as leverage instead of an obstacle. Amazing talk from Kelly McGonigal!! I wonder if she is the mytical twin sister of Jane?



I have an insane amount of stress, it&#39;s when any task or simple talk seems overwhelming, you feel pressured and very angry at anything, can&#39;t think straight or do logical simple solutions to things. It&#39;s something like that.

I don&#39;t even know what stress feels like can someone explain to me

Hello haha
hello.
