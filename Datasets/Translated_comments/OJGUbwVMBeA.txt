I have faith and believe gay people can go to heaven. Imo the Bible is NOT God&#39;s word it&#39;s man&#39;s interpretation of God&#39;s word. Never be ashamed of being gay their is nothing wrong with it. Stay true to yourself have true faith if you can and God bless you Ô∏è im also the kind of person to tell you to go f yourself if you have a problem with my take

I love this song so much. This song is the reason I became a Demi Lovato fan in first place. Actually, there were a lot of songs that made me into a Demi Lovato fan

For Matthew broomhall

Listening to 2024 the year of the Deer Ô∏è‚Äç

I don't listen to Demi Lovato much
I liked this song, I want it newer, now I don't like it so much
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠<a href="">1:26</a>‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨28‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨
[26] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; [27] and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. [28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.

This is my new fav song 
you dont like god  what youre doing here you dont deserve be alive

It&#39;s very good

So happy to have someone like Demi actively participate in the community, even now in 2024! 

Demi tried to cash in on a movement and quickly turned around and ran the other way when she realized what a train wreak it is.

R-i-d-√≠-c-u-l-a! 
Demi best player
Still listening this masterpiece in 2023 and will be listening in 2024... Proud of my queen Cher, also Demi was my diva hero Ô∏è

I like this song because it helps me. Because I got used to hiding my sexuality for knowing if I am bisexual or not. Because it isn&#39;t appropriate for a 3 year old to know how to become a bisexual. That&#39;s why ever since I was 3 years old I had a hard time growing up with this injustice that my dad is spreading hate like this I don&#39;t like him for saying, &quot; it&#39;s against our religion&quot;. That&#39;s why I had a hard time for finding acceptance for my sexuality from my childhood. For along time ever since my whole childhood my dad never liked me to come out who I really am but It wasn&#39;t really my choice. That&#39;s why I got used to hiding my sexuality from him because he thinks that it&#39;s against our religion.That&#39;s why I suffered from this injustice from my childhood until adulthood.

demi slaaaaay
I‚Äôm giving this song 100% I know LGBTQ+ we really need how to give those people to make a life experience and it gives them the official foundation to raise money for LGBTQ+ take my advice let‚Äôs find a foundation for LGBTQ+ to help them.<a href="">#VEVO</a> <a href="">#LGBTQ</a> <a href="">#VEVOPop</a>

This is one of her best songs. I have to admit it!

With each new drop, Demi Lovato consistently amazes us with her musical prowess, consistently presenting Authentic views as the crucible for unbridled talent, resonating throughout the rhythmic cultural terrain. It serves as the true epicenter where artists forge their paths to greatness. My girl skillfully harnessed its power.

Honestly i just miss when you made music just because

this deserves 1B
The verses sound like the &quot;I drove my car into a bridge&quot; song and the pre-chorus has shades of&quot;Shadows of the Night &quot;, but guess what? I really don&#39;t care! I like the song anyway

Anyone in 2023? 
I love this song. This is my 3rd favourite song after Cool for the summer and Heart attack.

<a href="">2:38</a>

Dont care what is wrong.. its big mistakes.

Too bad us want equality to a bunch of phycos making demands and praying on children  alot of real gays are disgusted to be gay right now because of the bullshit...

Even thought I&#39;m a metal guy, I kind if like this song. It&#39;s got some aggression and attitude. Plus I was at that pride parade and if I saw myself and my face was blurred, I would be sad.

Favorite song

LSS

<a href="">2:56</a> so Travis Barker just spawns anywhere huh?

When I came out as gay 30years ago i had a hard difficult time being accepted particularly by church people who professed at being my friends and also family members who i loved so dearly at the time unfortunately 30 years later i am estranged from my family and left the church after being a member since i was a young 14year old teenager i am not certain i could ever reconcile with my immediate family nor my church family

Love this song. Ô∏èÔ∏è
Most beautiful song video, my favourite video, best song video, I love you this video, my favourite video best

I my God I completely forgot abt this song due to trauma hhh and I suddenly found it again 10 years later I&#39;m literally sobbing rn

Hi

No offense to people but this video is very disturbing

How could I never noticed that Travis Barker was behind with the drums... And it came like 10 years ago

i like it a lot omg

Next Rock Version...please 

cher Lloyd have the same bday as me

The only thing in the video that I would change is perez hilton and wilmer lol

Ma√Ætre Gims je suis d√©j√† ta ¬´¬†fan¬†¬ª, il y a plusieurs ann√©es. Whosever idea this collaboration was - you‚Äôre genius! I‚Äôd love to hear the story of how you all came together. Armenian, French and English  Mi gna  I listen to you guys at least once a day 

I love this song so much.She just so proud. I‚Äôm happy &amp; love proud to be part of the LGBTQ. She just great singer and person.

I‚Äôm Christian so I‚Äôm often labeled as a homophobe but the Christians who hate and make lgbt people feel like sh*t for loving who they want really piss me off

NO NON O THIS IS TRASH
People are sad  after everything jesus did for you....... ppl still do this

I would talk I would talk but even if the stars and moon collide I never want u back into my life oh oh oh I really don care love that part

This song helped me through Highschool bc fuck bullies nobody deserves hates js be yourself fuck wha they think or say 

Cherr 
Very good song I  really don‚Äôt care

OK how do I erase stuff out of my brain

Seems like a nice woman.  I think her music is crap.  Sorry.

Just realizing Travis Barker was on drums, no wonder I love this so much.

Still best :))
After 9 years this song is a trend 

I miss the early and mid 2010&#39;s gay vibes.

When she says care got me like 

When i was 4 i saw this music video and didnt really know what it was about , but i LOVED this song so i took my dads phone and sang the song .Sang my 4 year old heart out.

Much success my love 
What an incredible woman Ô∏è
This song just popped in my head out of here omg , what a throwback

The preachers were not spreading hate they are spreading guidance, btw you can‚Äôt spell lgbtq without an L! 

WTF why does this video have alot of views

She&#39;s straight and she got a boyfriend and she stills support LGBT rights, she&#39;s awesome 

I support LGBT rights too and I don&#39;t like people who intolerant and racist either and some straight people is kinda mean and selfish against other people rights too

as much as im not i to the same sex i do like this

true wax is truly a hit!!
Really the song is good but mv...... so badddd

This is my favorite Aphmau song I like

Oh oh oh i really don&#39;t care

We need this Fun and brightful Demi again

Rip gender
He does love all. But not all are saved

Happy pride, lovatics!
It seems incredible that I loved and loved this song when it came out 8 years ago, seeing this type of videos at that time was very strange :3
I used to have beautiful German Australian woman hips and a prettier face then you

That intro is what we all need to hear sometimes especially in times like now. For so long I doubted myself for nothing, there is no other option but to live our lives to the fullest and show that we are no different and are just living our best life. Now my best friend who is straight says you just live your best life and I will support you and celebrate love together.

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH

There are two GENDERS that‚Äôs a fact not an opinion 

Ok. I&#39;m a Christian and all i wanna say is we  don&#39;t care what ur sexuality is. Just don&#39;t shove it down our throats. We fr dgaf abt ur sexuality. Also God loves all anyway. Thats all i have to say. God Bless yall.

Just because people play Hogwarts Legacy, LGBT harass people, so why can&#39;t LGBT find out and klii the author harry potter, why harass others

I really don&#39;t care too girl and boys are losers and girls are popular like even though they look cool they&#39;re not cool. I love girls, no boys but girls are the best like they could do cartwheels and boys king. They just do it wrong. I hate it because if he comes in my life I will pump to him in his face. I will talk. I will talk and I don&#39;t want you in my life or like get all my life

LOVE THE SONG!
My class mates are like &quot;OMG he&#39;s/she&#39;s gay OMG&quot; like if they&#39;re gay it&#39;s not a problem it&#39;s they&#39;re choice

I really respectfully must disagree because you really do see me much the same way and the evidence is your obvious oh well so what Mike  has came from such  a long very difficult journey and come on don&#39;t you dare treat me like I&#39;m stupid or don&#39;t know exactly your true feelings and inner motivation so your defense mechanism clearly is to haunt the living crap out of me and this is why I simply felt well damn talk about having the most difficult task for last this is a very much a understatement. If you actually didn&#39;t give A shit about me what so ever then we already would have had the necessary conversations that obviously are mutually needed and since I was the guilty one I had to wait til you initiated our very long overdue talk that even if this won&#39;t ever put myself back into your life at least there be closure knowing that I am going to try to at least make some amends. I don&#39;t at all ever think you just express we are good Mike. But please ask yourself why have you truly been lurking in the shadows watching me for??? Yes I am very skilled just like yourself except I have the blessing to read ppl real feelings even on occasion thoughts so just be real about our stuff so together we Can find a way to move into this new Era on such better terms than either of us could ever guess until we both act like the mature adults we both are ok I know how more than accomplished you truly are and I do know how damn incredibly hard you have busted your ass overcoming so much stuff so I can&#39;t ever ask you to let me into your life but I have to take this very blessed opportunity to try to somehow make the best efforts I can to show you how very much that period also has really messed with myself so why are you this closed off unless you never believed how very haunted this has lingered with myself

8 June 2023 I love this song so much 

i love demi lovato but this just seems wrong

I love this song so much
Also I like the song but not the vid

G-d made a boy and a girl not a boy and a boy or a girl and a girl so this is disrespecting g-d and it is not appropriate for kids

Kinda like me and my friend she was breaking up with someone but she couldn‚Äôt get her words out. So I just screamed at them . I did get detion but she‚Äôs happy now

This a great video

S CLASS BY SKZ

I was 1 day old when this song was alive,Ever since, i probably listened to this song And now ,this song wont die its always gonna be a masterpieceDont judge people it always have a way to come back to you

Demi, I really love this song by you and Cher Lloyd. The beats really catchy, and I now love the music video a lot, you two, go!

So beautiful and damaged to support those people who deprave and damage society.
This was a song for a Barbie fashion game I would play as a kid.  I love this song sm

Wow,this is rlly the 10th TIME I hear this music and even this is 8years ago 2023 blew this up

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!

Happy pride month

I will never get tired of being LOVATIC  #1 fan here in MEXICO üá≤üáΩ
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMBER
the worm on a string 

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!

The first time I heard this I was 8 and I listened to it today and now I am 16

Slayed

2023

Happy Pride Month everyone 
How many of you agree that old songs always rock till now.

<a href="">1:25</a>  what... In... The... World...

LGBT destroy morality
Happy Pride 2023
She let her feelings out i love this  song

Loving everyone means wanting everyone to obey the Eternal, abandon their sins and be born again, so that they can have eternal life.LGBTQIA+ practices are a sin.

I don‚Äôt support lgbtq+ but I love how happy they are. RESPECT EVERYONE!

Sodom and Gomorrah

<a href="">1:45</a> WHY?

B

I see the Romans 1:18 sign but I&#39;m pretty sure they didn&#39;t read chapter to which talks about judging one another is also a great sin they are such hypocrites. Those who condemn others only condemn themselves

Now this is my favorite Demi Lovato song and I will definitely listen to this song in pride monthÔ∏è‚Äç<a href="">#Love</a> is love

The fuck . This song promote LGBT 

Gay is a sin 

I LOVE REALLY DONT CARE

2023

PRETTYYYY

Love the song and your hair

good song bad video
To hell with you all

Thank you demi, how great you are <a href="">1:41</a>
Our lord says love everyone, it does not say we must agree with what you stand for. It also does not change the fact that you are proud of your sin. Jesus even says do not be proud of your sin. I hope everyone can find away to Jesus and away from the devil.

Love your amazing voice , songwriting and of course most of all your beautiful heart ! And I miss you a million xxooxx

We are all human. So please  don&#39;t embarrass someone because of their gender. If someone makes fun of you because of your gender, don&#39;t listen. Be yourself. Don&#39;t change as others want. I&#39;m bisexual and I am proud of myself. Ô∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚Äç
This is the song I would sing to all my ex friends and boyfriends

This song and some of your songs gave me the courage to come out as a lesbain to my familly and freinds  Now  i am so much happier now that i can be who i really am

I love this song

I like the song but I don&#39;t like the theme which contains LGBT which is quite opposed by religion

I liked how well Demi sang in the pride parade in West Hollywood

Song for my last ex. I&#39;m looking for new opportunities and experiences. This time, the chance is for me. Not for who disappointed me for many times. I love myself

I think liking this song at 6 was a sign

Who didn‚Äôt come here because of tiktok?

IN JUNE IT'S 9 YEARS OLD MDS  ALL THIS FROM THIS YAG ANTHEM 
I love the song but it doesnt mean i support LGBTQ ‚Ä¶

IS THAT TRAV BARKER?! no wonder this song BUMPS

The best teen song ever!!!

Everybody listening??..
Very good... I love this song!!..
Everybody listening??.

She is strong.

Everybody listening??
I saw my bf this song whan we were breaking up so im pretty sad about me and him breaking up

I dedicate this song to my brother Holder Caio
<a href="">0:46</a> That I would talk

Omg

All the disgusting bastards are gathered together haha.
Dede brown goes to Heaven.

If jesus loves all , then i have to reject Jesus as lord and Savior. Im not sharing salvation, otherwise its just meaningless.For that reason i must reject the Jesus character, he isn&#39;t reliable.Still love this song though!!!

make this viral 
Demi is so sweet and on sunny she was really cool love you bye

This was on birthday June 8th

Holy Shit that&#39;s Travis Barker on the drums!! He getting it back there!!! Good pussy builds strong bones!!!

I was looking for this song for so long because I was listening to it on the radio when it came out, until I suddenly found it on an Instagram real 
Just rewatched this song and ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THIS SLAPS

<a href="">2:17</a>

Jesus loved all but never laid with another man. His love is beyond your meager &quot;physical&quot; love you sorry mortal

Awesome  vibe from inside

There&#39;s mean girl in my soccer team and in my head I am telling them am doing this next time I see them 

I gasped when I saw her ex ...

This is the first time that I&#39;ve noticed Travis on the video

8 years???? I'm old
How did I never find this before now? It&#39;s a beautiful music video and a great song. Perfect!

God I forgot how hood song this was . Saw it on a rommie video

Too much nostalgia, success üáßüá∑
I thought I will be with my bf for a long time but he and I broke up 

Dang I was 3 when this song was made

Oh god I&#39;m in tears seeing this ;_; that opening. As a queer this hit so hard.

Ok!! But is that travis barker??? I&#39;ve watched this so many times n i just realised that

Got this as my personality song on Tik tok lmao

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I‚Äôll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and ‚ÄúClover Cage - Learning To Love Myself‚Äù are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you Ô∏è

good song but video is gross

<a href="">2:14</a>
This video makes me not like the song anymore

I really hated this.

I Loveee that Cher Lloyd is in it

She can Yell, Scream, Shout and Sing about it, buy she can&#39;t come &quot;Straight Out&quot; and say it!

Sorry about when I watched this clip without understanding it
My fav part:BUT EVEN IF THE STAR THE MOON COLLIDE I NEVER WANT YOU BACK INTO MY LIFE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR WORDS AND ALL YOUR LIES  OH OH OH I REALLY DONT CARE !

Don&#39;t ever be ashamed for being LGBTQ+!!! Love is love and they can keep their religion in their churches!

Ughhh, I was really enjoying this video I haven`t seen in so long unitl <a href="">2:32</a>, I never liked him. Good thing he only appears a second

She is black and ugly. Her file is closed. She does not have a diploma. She uses drugs
God is God

Demi Lavoto is God

Lgbtq er maire chudi khankir pola nodir out demi lovatore chodai kutta dia

claiming she know Jesus and now she&#39;s worshiping Satan. Just Sad.

weather or not u support lgbt stuff, this song slaps either way

Good old days when these homophobic rats didn‚Äôt exist 

omggg i remember this soundÔ∏è
I can&#39;t believe all these evil in this video

Demi so beautiful and very nice  
Jesus made it so simple. ‚ÄúLove God, and love people‚Äù that‚Äôs it. Yes, it really is that simple. He didn‚Äôt say judge them, or ridicule them, you don‚Äôt get a pass if their way of life is different. No matter race, religion, sexual orientation, whatever. Love them.

Yes

I can imagine the dislike buttons

I like this song. But people like Demi believe they have all the tolerance but only for people who share her world view.

Its 2023 and this song is still a bop I loved this song sense I realized I was queer at 15

8 yeas ago i i just love this song now i can understand this vedo and feel im also belongs to that rainbow 

Why 2010s pop was so generic?

Who in 2023??

I love Demi Lovato 
Astra inclinant, sed non obligant.The stars incline, but they don&#39;t oblige. Same sex politics isn&#39;t the obligation that sexism says it is. The right to vote has been extended beyond what it was in ancient Athens or Rome.

Confused

Member when pride didnt involved adult men dressed as women shoving their junk in ten years olds faces? i member...

We should all have the option to protest freely, no matter what others think about the subject you intend to promote. That said, I&#39;m not bi, trans, or gay. I am a Heterosexual male. I don&#39;t have to be in support of the LGBTQ Community to accept their decisions on what they want to represent as. I&#39;ll treat people with respect, no matter the type or pronoun they decide to call themselves on.

Neighbors like to ruin people&#39;s health. Like mine. Cause of YouTube. These devices I have in my ears are lethal omg.

This song was really successful  congratulations I liked the tone of the rhythm I'm your fan kisses Demi Lovato ps: Manel Ô∏è
Wish I could cut someone off mid sentence and sing them the part where she goes ‚Äúoh oh I really don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Cause most of the times I don‚Äôt

like   this   song    tiktik

All of us in 2020 be like: I really don‚Äôt care

God loves you all
Hey, demi, you picked the wrong lover

Someone found I&#39;m jlos birth daughter
been listening to this on replay bc megan (swagatronforever) got me hooked again

i love this video

Yup , these idiots now are clearly losing the hate battle vs the gays so their guns are pointed at pregnat women cause they are &quot; killing babys &quot; and will go to hell , it&#39;s always before thebabyisborn &quot; don&#39;t do it we will help you &quot; , after the baby is born &quot; get a job moocher &quot;

Brooo the music is SUPER good!!!! Demi you look pretty tho

I&#39;m dying

I&#39;m dating max she letting me and I have 13 parrots and mini horse and a house and a job at home hardware down here

This video is so cringe it makes me homophobic

This was literally done 8 years ago and we are literally now in 2021
Hellooo
I liked the song very good in support of lgbtqs I don't know if demi and biseual this song is very good
BE PROUD Ô∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚Äç
The Golden Age of Pop really was a better time just in terms of what music wanted us to feel. Happy.

Is the drummer kourtneys husband?

From the day this song came out it has been my anthem, only for me to come out as a lesbian in 2019‚Äç

I don&#39;t feel good I don&#39;t know why I have mental health and autisum

Gods Love is Sodom and Gomorrah a Second Time.

Not an LGBT, But I heard this song playing in a Mall, and Yes! it was Catchy, I finally found it.

I&#39;m a Christian and I know what said, I hear,.  Keep my mouth shut   my daughter has a beautiful wife with 2 handsome sons and 2 gorgeous daughters.  I wish someone would say they are going to hell   because  I&#39;ma snatchem up show them how south hell is then pray for forgiveness  it&#39;s okay,  we all in this together. God loves us all and I&#39;d like to believe that my creator would rather have us love one another and none of my business how, then to  tear each other down and kill each other with the words of hate. So whatever you believe in, whoever you believe in, stand for something or you&#39;ll fall for everything. As for me, me and my house will serve the Lord.

show and ball man
 this is song oh god

When did they blur the faces in the background?!? They weren&#39;t blurred originally?!?

Still love it! Love from Hungary!

I have never seen such beauty, such sweetness, such energy in my life. The video is already perfect, there is nothing to say about the song beyond that. Sia is in the first row, I take demi levoto in the 2nd row, demi levota &lt;3
During my first ever college party, a buddy of mine stumbled into the room, shoutet &quot;AUA AUA AUA, i realy don¬¥t care&quot; and just collapsed while puking everywhere.Ever since then, this song has had a very special place in my heart!

Thanks to you DEMI FOR THIS MASTERPIECE Ô∏è

I&#39;m not in the LGBTQ community but I&#39;m an alli

Make something satanic in this genre , 

They got you in that song as a homosexual person ,that is for homosexual rights ,

Now, after years, I realized that Traavis is playing the drums
I&#39;m little Kelly Clarkson she&#39;s my mom im cute

Travis barker!

Bullshit Song. I Hate LGBTQ Songs &amp; Movies.

Jkkjmmnn
I feel sick , dissapointed cause this is the first time watching this video uggg

Demi Lovato tava na parada gay
I love this song

My thoughts on this song..is this all about her ex-friend ..yo&#39;ll now whom I&#39;m preferring to 

This has to have one of the worst lyrics for a chorus, ever. &quot;Even if a massive astronomical disaster occurred, I still wouldn&#39;t want to see you&quot; ok.. just.. why

NOBOBYS FUCKED. ALL RIO SUCIDALS. Its Politics and Religions. THE WHOLE WORLD FUCKED THANKS KINDLY IN HER SONGS.

Didn&#39;t even know this was about pride until now, damn...

Did  you that video on you tube  were all the Simo resales were getting arrested

Like the song not the video

You can take your words and all your lies wow that sounds like the world is going through crisis

The divine music I encountered in junior high school
It‚Äôs sad when this is the most relatable song

mood rn:

Cher 

Damn girl bumping into everything that could squeal and you into the opportunity of deflating some tire that had its chance but only was scarred!

Lets Go Brandon

This is a great song, sucks how Joe goes out dating that Ashley girl after ending things with Demi, wish he never did that. but oh well?

they just care abt abnormal se*

Auto tuneee

It bad to god

this song is lit for roadtrip

This video really fits Demi now that she‚Äôs a part of the LGBTQ community Ô∏è‚Äç

22

I miss hearing this song when I was 13
slayed

Revolting people, revolting lifestyle.
OK, it&#39;s 2022, and am I the only one who just now noticed Matthew Scott Montgomery is in this? He was in So R@n:0m!

The beginning of groomers, are gonna groom

2022?

 in my country if anyone knows I&#39;ma Gay , they will kill me ...

I  hate homosexuality but the song is unbelievable

Another amazing singer who ruined her career by conforming to the LGBTQ+ cultists&#39; media propaganda. Its so fucking sad

Ji re wall

This song is for my mother-in-law :P

Nice 
I think its cool how Demi is non-binary; Idk if im supporting them, I probably am

I really don‚Äôt have a problem with Gays because they are humans just like us and the people who hate them are just paranoid and mentally ill!

Did the songwriters get sued by icona pop for this? 

Fuck my ex and family who are not willing to  call me by my new name

Yeah god first created adam and johnson hahahahaha

This song pretty much says it all. But just in case you need to hear my words: I‚Äôm over it. Maybe someone will come along and change my mind someday. But honestly it‚Äôs up to the universe. You all f***ed up. You let that fraud mess with you and make you all walk away from me. You filled the wrong cup!! All of you!!! I was the only one filling your cup and now that I refuse to fill your cup you are finally realizing who the real one was and the fake. So since you choose the fake‚Äîkeep her! The real one don‚Äôt want you back!! 

Seeing a pride a parade makes me tear everytime  I&#39;ll never experience this living / being born in a homophobic country is a worst thing that can happen to a lgbt person

the song is good but the music video is a big L

why everyone gotta wear the leash and colar that is religion, the sooner humans soo that religion is a false way of controlling the masses the sooner humans will prosper, we are all human, from earth, or diversity defines us, but we are human and pathetic and need a &quot; god&quot; to guide us cuz without a fictional deity we are idiotic murderous panicky animals.

Indeed Jesus loves all. Don&#39;t be mean people because Jesus loves everyone no matter the gender. Ô∏è

How nostalgic 
Hello 2022 
She is very wonderful Ô∏è
I really like your songs, you are really beautiful, I love you very much, you have strengthÔ∏èÔ∏è

I love you&#39;re songs sooooooooooooooooooo much!  honestly, I&#39;m actually pretty bossy and love  telling people what to do. 
Damn you
Oh Look at this Wilmer supporting her like always such a bad guy‚ÄçÔ∏è

This still hits the same. hands down Demi is a fucking queen. Idk why is she so underrated. Like look at her best vocals her lyricism everything is just so exceptional

I didn‚Äôt remember this song existed and I come back to see Cher Lloyd and Travis barker is here?? Fuckkkk that‚Äôs sick  as hell

who&#39;s here? hahah its 2022 but I&#39;m still listing to this song

<a href="">2:32</a> Demi wrote a song abt that dude. Stream &quot;29&quot; by Demi Lovato!

i‚Äôm bisexual/pansexual and non-binary, i love this song. i‚Äôm not out to my dad, he believes lgbtq+ people follow a trend and are confused, my mom needs time to adjust to me being lgbtq+, my sister is the most accepting and understanding.Ô∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è‚Äç

I remember when I played a Barbie dress up game and this song was always repeated 
You are going to hell if you support these new trends. Demi herself isn&#39;t gay.she should practice what she is preaching

Burn in hell poster? Ja ja

When I was younger I listened to this song but my father never let me see the music video because it was an "ugly" thing, today I understood that it was because of the LGBTQI+ Parade and him not letting me see the music video didn't help anything hahahaha
She deserves so many grammys for this

I hate you I hate you 
2022 and I'm still listening to this anthem

This ANTHEM marked my adolescence, I remember several moments of discovery with Really Don't Care, one of the most beautiful works of Demi's career.

Heroic pop music from Demi Lovato.And &quot;heroic&quot; is the right word.Talking about the song here, not the video.Though the video is cool too.  Super cool.Thanks Demi.

Working with you is what a great mystique and discipline. That is why the US is a power.
This is the breakup song we all needÔ∏è

Cher Lloyd and Travis Scott are spectaculars.

Beautiful Demi, I want to be in a concert.

I remember hearing this when I was finishing my first year in High School in 2014. Man, I miss the good old days so much!

That hair was so beautiful...
The RaptureFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.Deuteronomy 30:19 R.MWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ‚Äã‚ÄãAS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

THATS A GOOD WAY TO CELEBRATE JUNE NOT BECAUSE ITS THE LAST MONTH OF SCHOOL YEAR ITS ALSO LGBTQ MONTH

She is soooo stunning with black hair!

Happy pride month in June 2022!

I always thought that the Cher Lloyd was soooo short ! She should have joined during the verses and the chorus too.Honestly, she wasn&#39;t necessary on this track. Demi was more than enough, but I just wish they did a proper collaboration song.

Demi go back to what you were god, I love you
While it is true that Jesus loves everyone, that does not mean that he represents gay and all that. It clearly states in the Bible that homosexuality is wrong. Don&#39;t let a popular artist and a catchy song mislead you and misinterpret what Jesus stood and died for

HAPPY PRIDE
I love you demi
Wth is Cher Lloyd singing/saying? xd

1.25 Hail hand&#39;s up
Nevermind I hate this song

Good old days Ô∏è‚Äç

Just noticed that the drummer was missing plates hehehe n play same thing along..but besides that I love the song message.

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!!!!!

Man, this song still SLAPS

Imagine if you died right now, where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after you take your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you have never broken any of God‚Äôs Laws, in other words, if you have never committed sin, and every single one of us have sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven‚Äôs Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in the same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.¬†If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God‚Äôs power on the third day according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs down your inner being, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.¬†John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.¬†John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.‚Äú¬†Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.¬†Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.¬†Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.¬†Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.¬†1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.¬†Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.¬†Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.¬†John 10:10 ‚Äì (Jesus said:) ‚ÄúThe thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.‚Äú¬†1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.¬†Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.¬†The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.¬†In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name. Amen.

Wow, as a kid I never knew this was about lgbtq. I was too busy vibin to the song XD
