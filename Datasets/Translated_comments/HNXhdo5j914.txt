Fact: three keeper playing in one match

It was khoyal😂😂😂
Kiwi deserved to win it all could have been truly 😮fairy tale ending for Kane Williamson 😢with 2 consecutive finals. Yet always ending on the short side of the stick.💔

Who see this in 2025?? 😢

Searched 2019 on YouTube and arrived here

Who are you looking forward to in 2024?
There is chance 10 ball 25 runs but dhoni dont want wrold cup under virat kholi bcz dhoni want only his name after all 28 years 😊

Actually I understand why India was able to defeat New Zealand in 2023 World Cup 2 times. The thing is even though NZ&#39;s batting is not so great, but their speciality is the swing in their bowling by which batsmans get confused and get out. In English pitches, swing occurs most that&#39;s why they were dangerous.In Indian pitches, swings occurs very rarely that&#39;s why batsmans do not get confused and just easily hit the ball. India&#39;s speciality is their batting that&#39;s why they were able to make such a huge score in 2023 World Cup.

Revenge taken
Bhai isei run out ne to sabhi ka dill toda tha💔💔

I saw this match .... When I was in Hyderabad... to attend my cousin marriage.. I saw this match at hotel&#39;s room

Watching this match still in 2024...😊

The 2022 T20i world cup semi-final between England and India, and the 2023 ODI world cup final is even better than this:)  🤣😂🤣

I invite everyone to listen holy Quran &amp; Islamic speech from the India🇮🇳❤😊❤😅😂😊

Dhoni is mainly responsible for this defeat

<a href="">5:22</a> worst moment for ICT😢

Still hurts 😢
Due to Dhoni Selfish batting India lost that semi final Dhoni Did not want that playing under other captancy India won World cup....

Aus taken the revenge of nz by winning the final 2023 wc.....🗿🗿

Dhoni lost the match, he didn't want to win the match under someone else's captaincy.
Who is watching this in 2024

Sir Jadeja 77* ❤
Mad 💛 forever ❤
chokli sala 😂😂😂😂😂

I wish Dhoni also won the way he played to match 48 overs.
Left handed batsman are always destructive against NZ : Fakhar zaman and jadeja

Jadeja underrated fr

Thala and Rocking star sema knock 🎉🎉🎉
Indian again choked

I don&#39;t know when India loses, these Pakistani people get&#39;s earthworm on their a&#39;s 😂😂

Fifth consecutive lost of India in ICC tournament,, newzealand batted badly and india batted worse,,, sluggish pitch,, one day match became two days match,,, Indian top order again flopped in any icc knockout match, moreover, jadeja got out at wrong time and finally, dhoni runnout..

That horrible expression of umpire

I ate here today also...
It&#39;s 2024 but still it hurts 😢😢

Who is here after defeating in semis but not in world cup😢

Why its always Dhoni when an extraordinary Direct hit comes from opposition in Pressure Wc matches 😢💔..Why ?

Dhoni was not serious to win this match but the very  same situation was in ipl and Dhoni won it. 🤔

New Zealand defended 239 in 2019, butIndia failed to defend 240 in 2023.

<a href="">4:26</a> truly what a shotWhenever I watch it ❤❤❤And <a href="">4:34</a>

India still has not won any major trophy since 09 years 😅😅😅 but look good on paper. Pat Cummins silencing the entire crowd effortlessly.😅😅😅😅 India look good on pilot exams but when it comes to final exams the crucial ones they are utterly failing😅😅😅😅 despite cheating😅😅😅

Good bowling by pat and boult

Who is here after Tom Curran injury?

If &quot;some day I too will see this spectacle with a smile&quot;
Ye match me Mohammad shami chai ye tha❤

If Pakistan won against Sri Lanka So Pakistan could have won this match by 18 runs how New Zealand Did

No matter what happens, the mother runs out.
2024 stiill hurts

who is here in 2024 😢wtc loss ,wc loss against australia pure pain &gt;&gt;

Sad india still loose world cup 2023 world cup har zaidha chubegi life time.....

Even today we remember this 😭😭😭😭😭
Dhoni done it for NZ
Why MSD at no.7 ? 😢

2019 new zealand 240, 2023 india 240 in final. what a co-incidence! india losted both match.

Suresh raina, yuvraj singh agar hote toh match k condition kuch aur hote pant, dinesh karthik se toh behtar the!

At least we were not cheating

And still lost😂

Many people say we lost 2019 world because of dhoni but they don&#39;t know real truth us samay semi final ka pressure aur uspe se new Zealand jaisi team jb aapke 6 Wicket gir gaye ho aur run jada ho kyuki openers sb 1-2 runs p out ho gaye ho tb bhi aap half century score karo but kismat ko kuch aur hi manjoor tha us din 😔💔

It hurts till today😢
Thala rahte to we would have won this match, bring back thala.

<a href="">3:05</a> 😭😢😥

New Zealand defeated India

i m here after statement of Yuvraj’s father and i damn sure, dhoni has played very good, India was on 23-4, and they are blaming to Dhoni, Ms is a legend players love you Mahi, 😊

Apart from Dhoni last match, this match is far better than IND vs AUS Final 2023

India

Dhoni slow batting
I love ❤kane
No matter who wins the WC, he should play the semi-final number 2 because he is the one who has made or won the WC. Look at the history of NZ playing the first semi-final, this time India has played the first semi-final.
Why double take

Dhoni : 2015 run out direct hit2019 run out direct hitStill hurts😢

Wow Henry

People keep forgetting the fact because of the rain India had to wait a day to bat, it ruined their momentum

As I know cricket very well, watching like around 14 years, India will not win upcoming 2 WC, 2027, 2031 sadly

Heart breaking moment 😭💔
TBH with you, I wanted Kane Williamson (NZ) to win the world cup 2023All the Fab Four members have won the World CupKohli (2011)Smith (2015)Root (2019)I guess kane is just unlucky 😔, wish he plays for one last time in 2027 and Lifts the World Cup before hanging the boot

2015 SF india lost.2019 SF same.2023 in final again india lost.Now coming WC in 2024 T20 God knows who will win 😮😮

<a href="">05:13</a>

Karma for how these lundians played against England

Travis Head is the daddy of lundia

We lost this WC SF match because of Dhoni.  His scoring rate was too slow in that match.  If he had scored 60 runs, instead of 50 runs, in the 70+ balls he faced, he wouldn&#39;t have had to run like a madman in the end and wouldn&#39;t have gotten himself runout.

How does Dhoni's mind win over others' captaincy?

Very good Newzealand win india lose very good

Australia win cwc 2023.19th November Ahmedabad..beat ind by 6 wickets ....MOQAAAA MOQAAAA THOKAAA THOKAAAAA

Dhoni ka last batting tha 😭😭

This semi-final was far better than the attack we had in final 2023. My respect for New Zealand increased by leaps and bounds❤❤. Aussies are such a big cheaters. They stole trophy from New Zealand in 2015, stole trophy from India in 2023😞

So no one is going to appreciate Williamson’s. He played a brilliant knock of 67 runs when middle and lower literally collapsed and used the right bowler at the right time which resulted in victory

2017 CT final2019 WC semi final2013 WC final Continuously upsetting 💔

India Can Only beat New Zealand only in India 😢 Baaki Out Of India Mein Nhi Hara sakti ICC Tournament meinNz Beats India In England, South Africa,India,World cup T20

I would to watch this happen again and again in knockout games against India.

Watching again &amp; again gives me goosebumps. 🎉😂

After aus beat ind in final..new chokers Indian cricket team

Where can i watch full Highlights

Dhoni was not out

<a href="">3:05</a> watch this in slow motion kohli was not out here

Pat Cummins is afraid of indian crowd and he was against boundary to have a quiter ground and this somehow made the winning of the australia

New Zealand team performed well.

The New Zealand team performed well

Bradman of tuktuk academy mr k rahul thank u for being 12th player of Australia in final

2019: India couldn&#39;t chase 2402023: India couldn&#39;t defend 240Edit: Pat Cummins went against the crowd, the toss, the home advantage and won the WC. No IPL, no branding, no advertisement. Winning when it matters is in their blood. That&#39;s what Aussies are! Champions💥🏆

Who else is here after AUSTRALIA defeated India in final ahh! Congrats Australia you won the worldcup the way all Indian players were crying 😂😂😂 lol such an amazing final it is so satisfying to see india lose 😂😂😂

25 from 11 balls isnt hard to play i dont understand what was dhoni doing

it is so satisfying to see india  lose.

U know wht epic here? Umpires oooo reaction 😮

Atleast this much effort placed in 2023 wc we could digest the defeat. 2023 effortless batting and not even a single try made on bowling with Kohli,Iyer,Rohit.One man army Rohit brave man 💪

dhonis runout  hurts more than breakup 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😢😢😢😢😢
Kisey pata tha ki issey bhi bura 2023 me hone wala hai

Pathetic team selection <a href="">guys.Prime</a> example is Suresh Raina and Dinesh Karthik. First is  Suresh Raina  he really loves playing in England pitches and he has scored a whooping amount of runs in England, check his avg and stats.  He too scored brilliant 100 in odi in England in the 2014 series. Suresh Raina after the 2015  World Cup and he has not been considered and dropped from the team.. In fact Suresh Raina made a comeback again  in T20 series in  2018 in England conditions and after that again he has been dropped. Same case with  Dinesh Karthik too. , only thing he is in a team . Throughout 2018 and 2019 he has been trained to play a finisher role . All of a sudden he has asked to play anchor role against NZ in semifinals in 2019 and send ahead of Dhoni😂😂. Pathetic team selection

Kl rahul selfish player

Pl refer to the match highlights and decide for yourself how Jadeja and Dhoni played. Jadeja played aggressive: <a href="">

Everyone is doing the same but no one can do the work that Jadeja did.
Next video title: Newzealand Stunned by India and Kane was smiling.

Sir Ravinder Jadeja hero of this match❤

India 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
The blame for losing this match goes to Dhoni because Dhoni played 60 balls and scored only 43 runs, which is not the mark of a good batsman.
Heart breaking match in my life 💔🥺
Still blaming dhoni for not hit big shots look The day Kohli and rohit only takes 1 run and D.karthik taken 1 run after 20 balls Defended No one  looks that and All the reason for loss is dhoni

How many of you came here to rejoice in India&#39;s victory over NZ a few days back? 😃❤

Our India, Our pride 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳. Jai Hind ❤️🇮🇳❤️. World&#39;s best batsman Virat Kohli broke Sir Sachin Tendulkar&#39;s record and scored his 50th century ❤️, Shreyas Iyer&#39;s fastest century 😍, Mohammad Shami&#39;s seven wicket performance 🇮🇳. Our India to the finals❤️. Our country will win this world cup what so ever 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳.
Dhoni was a great asset to India but Dhoni cost us this game !!

That run out of msd changed the match side

This revenge got settled,plz update a new version 2023, we r n final and lift world cup tomorrow🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

<a href="">2:38</a> Jadega did the same thing after taking a catch this World Cup. I don&#39;t know how it is so coincidental plus both matches were semi-finals!

Dhoni gifted newzealand win this match

that run out still hurts

Henry Nicholls I can see the shorts😊

We could have won if dhoni didnt took double

It seems that when Dhoni felt that runs would not be scored, he would deliberately run out so that people would not blame him. I watched the 2015 semi-finals and the 2019 semi-finals here too. In 2015 he did not even ground the bet. And in 2019, where 2 runs could not be scored and there was no batsman left behind to score runs after Dhoni was out, he still ran for runs where there was only one run to be scored.
Dhoni likes to play like this

Pandya and pant could have played sensibly ..

New Zealand stunned by shami in shami final 😂😂

Nzl dono hi semifinals me acha khela. 2019 me low score ko defend karlia and 2023 me bade target ko chase karte karte reh gaya. Thanks to shami warna 397 esaily chase karleta Nzl. India ko pure worldcup me sirf Nzl ne takkar di warna 2ri team 250 bhi nhi bana pati.

Actual heartbreak moment for india is when jadeja got out and yes dhoni&#39;s moment is also big but sory my friend it was jadeja in 2019 who alone fight for india and i really upset with dhoni batting in this match he needed to soaked the pressure when 33 needed from 15

reveng has been  taken ❤❤❤❤

NZ every time defeated of india

Wtf is revenge, newzeland did not win the world cup

jadeja is fearless

In this match we can clearly see Indian batsmen are not even serious 😢 only jadeja given his 100%

Even though we win in 2023 now but still that runout haunts me and blunder by team management not to send MSD when 3 wickets down early.....2019 team selection and team management really sucked...hopefully we will win this in 2023 and get the job done.

Who is here after India defeated newzealand in semifinals

Look at this match carefully, it is clear that Dhoni has won the cup because he has passed this match, even 50 runs were not scored in 5 overs, Dhoni had also won the cup under the captaincy of Kohli, because if Kohli would cup Jeet jata to dhoni ka naam kam ya khatam hi ho jata jese Kapil Dev ka ho chuka hai Dhoni does the same thing in the media, he also takes the name of Kapil Dev, in the same way Virat would have got runs, that's why he himself runs even after risking his life. Sabi knows who is out when 7,8 of the team are out, when Dhoni is playing, I have seen in some matches that he plays by himself, when he does not take singles, even when Dhoni knew, there is no one after my out. Even if the team could win, he was running double. Today I saw Dhoni was also there. Team India defeated the semi-finals of 2023. This is the only act of victory. Virat is not the captain, still he wants the team to win the cup. Rohit is the captain, yet there is someone in Virat. There is also a greed that if Rohit doesn't win, his name will become famous. Some people will say that Dhoni would have won the cup in 2011. These people will not even know why a player would not have won the cup.
Im still very good impressed with NZ being an indian. Very humble and down to earth team. Love frok india 🇮🇳

It must have been a very sad night for New Zealand's mother, but seeing this highlight of Rohit Kohli Dhoni's agony, this is the highlight. Have all the land or old journey been re-invented? Has it changed since 2003? Indian heroes don't complain for 3-4 years...

Look how the ball is swinging wildly when India comes into bat. It looks so suspicious. Why were no questions asked about the ball being changed? There was much more movement when India was batting. Pitch is the same for both sides right?

India defeated NZ in semi-finals 😊2023
India beat newzeland in 2023 worldcup

Bdla poor hota. It's true 😭😭😭😭😭team india in finals❤❤❤❤❤
India must change Kuldeep Jadav and include either Chahal or Aswin in the final. Kuldeep is of no use.. Chahal and Aswin are crisis breakers. In time of standstill situation they can create a break through..One time it looked India going to be defeated when Captain Williams and Century maker kiwi batsman were smoothly and confidently batting.. Chahal is a good fielder also. We want to see Kuldeep replaced by either Chahal or Aswin in the final..

<a href="">2:56</a> from 1 to 47 <a href="">3:05</a> from 1 to 117🔥

Someone after semis 🤩↓↓↓↓
After 4 years

That runout still haunts to this day! It was a game of probabilities.. it just didn’t turn out to be in MS’s favour.. had it not been a runout maybe the verdict could have been different, Who knows..A man who walked off the pitch getting runout when he started his career walked out of the park getting runout in his last innings but this time as a legend leaving a history, a tale to be told for the generations to come! Love you forever MSD07.

Who is here after India defeated New Zealand in semi final 2023❤🎉

Got back the revenge in 2023 semifinals ♥️

You are happily seeing it after Yesterday&#39;s win of India

Dhoni ke slow khelne ki Adat se Match gaya, kitne Dot ball khelenge semi final match hai dhoni ji, Lekin last over tak match leke gaye aur pressure badhta gaya, is halat main wicket gaya to kam ball main Jyada run kaise banayenge, App to run out hoke 11 ball chod ke gaye wo bhi Bollers ko khelne ke liye.

Redemption served- World Cup 2023: Nov 15th, 2023: Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai

REVENGE

it is as good team as 2023 team . too much nervous these player while batting , kl rahul technique is not good there as well , now he is back to norml technique , when he debut

WHO IS HERE AFTER DEFEATING NZ IN THE SEMIFINALS 2023😂😂😂 WHAT A REVENGE
Ask Gambhir why even today people get angry after seeing Dhoni's runout...the World Cup was not brought because of one 97 by Lave, it was only Dhoni who brought it 😅😅
Dhoni as good as he was really left things too late in this game. He should have pushed harder and Jadeja wouldnt have had to do all the hitting. Bad decisions by Dhoni in this one.

Mahi bhai leliya revenge this semi final for Mahi bhai
Waited for 4 years to comment on this video, finally got the revenge in this world cup, and that too for 2 times in single edition! Came here after India won the semi final against NZ with full team effort, Rohit and gill&#39;s start, virat&#39;s calm, composed and experienced 50th century and that too infront of his idol. No words to express this feeling and then Iyer and Rahul in the middle order giving the strength to this team and now the very special mention to one and only Mohammad Shami , sensational shami! His hardwork is paying him off! What a bowler! He single handedly took the charge of the bowling unit! Well done team! Let&#39;s win the final and let the party start in the dressing room after 12 years!🇮🇳❤️
