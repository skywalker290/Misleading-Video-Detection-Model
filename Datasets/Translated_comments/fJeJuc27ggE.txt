japan😭😭😭
I really sense Japan will win the world cup soon inshallah 🇯🇵🎌⛩️🏯🎎

I’m in here in 2024 . What a match !

Fast forward 6 years, Maraoane Fellaini, who has scored an amazing header in this match, has retired. Thank you for everything!

Felaini brilliant goal

How Genius is KDB !

Belgium to strong for all those teams.

I em happy for Belguim   BC  live in Belguim❤

The best match of the World Cup Belgium vs Japan
Well done 👍✅
Africa wins 🎉
Can we apprecite the relentless japan no 3 trying to cover chadli’s goal

IF JAPAN QUALITY TO QF THEN I THINK BRAZIL REACH TO SEMI FINAL 😂

<a href="">0:53</a> What if Courtois was the goalkeeper 😂😂😂

r e e l y b h e and o oh a y
Japan played really wellWell done 👍✅

best match ever
That evening, we went to bed proud of our Belgium with a monstrous smile
This is a curse. Never getting past the round of 16...

African team victory
Chadli fellaini morocco
This game was sad, I was really rooting for Japan
De Bruyne awful performance
Identify the Commentator

This probably was the GAME OF THE CENTURY ❤❤❤

Every fighting of Japan even lost is still so impressive..

Japan again. The loss was narrow but painful for the people. Following in his own footsteps in 2014, he lost 4:1 to Colombia. 2018 Colombia narrowly lost 2 : 1 but Japan lost embarrassingly and painfully to Belgium 3 : 2 Congrats Belgium, you are a tough team
An unforgettable match that I still come to see regularly. Belgium was the favorite to win, but Japan was also really great. I should have gone to the semifinals. If you look at Japan's level these days, it seems to be the best in Asia. Mental strength is also strong.
Best comeback of world cup 2018

This video will stop after 30 seconds.
Prime Hazard &lt;3
I felt every feeling during this match, sadness, annoyance, motivation, anger and above all happiness and relief. I cried so much during this match, at the end happy tears

The day I cried is this day.

I remember watching that Belgium counter attack live, it was the last action of the game and was just pure beauty how they made the comeback. Poor Japan deserved better they played very well but it was so unfortunate for them not to hold it until the end against a world class squad of Belgium.

One the best come back in World Cup history ❤

Next Target For Belgium : EURO 2024 Next Year In Germany ⚽️
Surprisingly, none of the Japanese players who played in this match remain in the current national team, and Japan recently won 4-1 against Germany, including Brighton's Mitoma, Real Sociedad's Kubo, and Arsenal's Tomiyasu. Japan is entering a golden generation, led by Lazio's Kamata and Sporting's Morita.
I don't understand why foreigners are provoking Japan with this video.
I feel like crying when I see Masako's return from Additional Time.
Oww! That Game 🥹🇧🇪
Japan trash lol
Bomb!!!

And people should receive key for their house room.

I see some friendship there.

4 years later, Japan come back much strong

<a href="">1:26</a> Courtois exactly knew what he was doing.. Ofc when KDB Counter attacking you,, it&#39;s over.

This is one of the most sad thrilling matches I&#39;ve ever seen!

Holy moly! What a great competition in 2018!
Who’s comes here from facebook?  Same as me

Unforgettable match 2018 fifa world cup

As a Belgian guy i can say This is The Greatest Match in Belgium History and it was a pleasure to watch it live .

Japan-Belgium is the best,❤❤❤
<a href="">1:54</a> is he rage quitting?????

The japanese player who slid at <a href="">1:36</a> literally tried all that he could

What is the name of ths commentator

Sad japn -from korean 😅

Gk is a f shame

still makes me so sad

It was frustrating, but it was a real honor as a Japanese to be able to compete on equal terms with the best Belgian superstars.
Japan was like 2. World war

I THOUGHT Japan GONNA WIN THIS but Belgium beated japan 3-2

<a href="">1:34</a> only one moment, when Lukaku didn&#39;t turn into Lakaka

One of the most attractive and forgettable football match in history.

Belgia ok 3=2

Japan oooooooo =2222222
Congrats to Belgium for this remontda but I was so sad for Japan, they are so clooose but the luck is sooo horrible

What a match wow Belgium and Japan

That man again - KDB 💙

Vertonghen's head... it's so frustrating.
Inui's non-rotating middle feels so good
Great match still after another world cup i&#39;m stiil watching

i can watch this million times and not get tired of it.

Sorry but Japan players to short 😂

Today&#39;s Japanese players are required to have decisiveness and a manager.

!BELGIUM GOOOOL JAPAN AND FRANCE FOOTBALL COME ENGLISH!

Japan-yamate kodassai💀
Insane!
so sad for Japan😢😢😭😭😭😭
I made it to the round of 16 in an ugly way and cleared out my karma haha.
The feelings of the Japanese people at that time cannot be expressed in words...
The match which set the stage for <b>BLUE LOCK</b>

What a game it was👏👏🤩

Who can forget this game 😯

It&#39;s hazard&#39;s prime time 🔥
<a href="">1:52</a>

and this is how the blue lock project was born

Lukaku, influencing everything without a single touch.

Japan goalkeeper trash lol he ruined the hard work done by the rest of the team

Lakaka

The only Asians teams left were Japan and Russia

We love you, Japan ♥️
It looked like Japan would win until midway through the game, but it was amazing when the Belgian national team scored 3 goals at once with a fearsome attack to achieve a comeback victory. Both teams are great for giving their best until the end.
<a href="">1:35</a> LUKAKU 🇧🇪🤣
This wasn&#39;t a football match , but an emotion

My favorite match on WC 2018👏

The world cup is the world cup, nothing in football is the same.
Where is Belgium these days?
what was that?Belgium have a incredible come back and defeat Japan 😯 🇧🇪3-2🇯🇵

I really miss Belgium’s run in Russia 2018 I don’t know why they have been horrible in Qatar 2022

I&#39;m Belgian and i was born in Brussels in October 2001 and congrayulations to Belgium

&quot;Courtois is the best goalkeeper&quot;

01 July 2002

I wanted japen to win :(

This true was the golden generation of Belgium

Surely has to be one of the best if not the best game in entire world cup history ....

Love from India🇮🇳❤️🇮🇳
as an indian i was supporting japan in this match wish someday india could also comeup with the legends like sunil chettri on the feild

Were they getting carried away by scoring two points?
This was such a crushing defeat to watch live

japanese players are so much shorter.. they are in so much disadvantage in headers

I think Japan can win in the future.
Before bluelock project

The best reverse sweep

<a href="">1:27</a> Team Japan would never expect Courtois would pass the ball to De Bruyne, neither would anybody else.

A storming second-half fightback from Belgium!!!

Announcers should pronounce last names of players properly - not like the British female announcer on Fox before who butchered Japanese last names

Fifa 2022 seems a bit fishy after watching all these matches spanning over the years!!!

We lost, but it was a really good match.
Since they did this, I&#39;ve been a fan of them since. This game was one of the most intense games I&#39;ve ever watched

vertongen header is an absolute miracle.. 😭😭😭 how is he even able to aim so well ? <a href="">0:53</a>

<a href="">0:54</a> this goal always have me in shock

2002Jul 2

Another heartbreak today😢

Very sad to see Japan lose like this again to Croatia. It seem with all odds, Croatia remains unbeaten for now through penalties. I hope Japan comes back from this 💪.

JapanThis is your time

What happened for Croatia in Qatar 2022??? 🤣🤣🤣

Belgium's loss was disappointing as there was a possibility of a rematch in the final tournament.
Vertonghen&#39;s header was difficulty off the charts (the ball was so high up and the open area was so small)

The number of views of recent World Cup highlights is amazing.
I am here after Lukaku’s disaster class in 2022 😀

Who&#39;s here after Belgium has been eliminated

Japan in WC 2022 will definitely win from Belgium.

The upset, confusion, and despair of this match. I finally got the right to clear everything up. Japan can do it. I will support him with the intention of dying so that he can definitely erase the regrets of four years ago. Good luck Japan! ! ! ! ! ! ! 🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
As a Belgian I would have dreamed of a rematch against Japan. If only Lukaku had scores against Croatia...

Only because they are European thats make them win against japan not because of skill, they are just higher😂

Despair
Doesn’t matter they destroyed Germany anyway🔥🎌😹

This game ripped out my heart  😞  Keisuke Honda&#39;s last ride

2018: the best world cup ever

And this year we are back in the top 16.
I want you to do your best so that this doesn't happen this time.I want you to be in the top 8 or higher this time.
where is belgium?
comeback! !
I wanted to get revenge against Belgium in the final tournament...😢
I always think of this game when Japan is in the lead.
I felt so bad for Japan, but that 3rd goal was the most beautiful counterattack I&#39;ve ever seen

Here is the winner

After this game 4 years in blue lock and  the result 1st place in Group stage against Spain Germany and Costa Rica

Hello Everyone. LORD LUKAKA and JAPAN&#39;S 4 YEAR CHALLENGE.

Even though I&#39;m Argentinean, I remember watching this game back in 2018, as I love Japan, and it was all I could think of during today&#39;s match. It&#39;s a shame the video doesn&#39;t show the timer; Belgium&#39;s third goal came at the <b>94&#39;</b> mark. I&#39;m very happy Japan finally made it to the Round of 16.That ball was out though.

This game you can see, that you shouldn‘t underestimate Japan. That’s why Germany and Spain lost.

Watching this as the sun sets on this golden generation 🥲 3rd place wasn&#39;t too shabby at least

Anybody knows the name of the commentator?

back when belgium was united

Stupid match (compliment)
if Brazil did not lose to Belgium, maybe the final match will bring together France and Brazil and the final will be interesting .

What a comeback

boy do I miss this belgian form....

Me

It's sad that Belgium is declining due to its aging population.
We need to put aside the Rising Sun flag and work together for the future of Korea and Japan. The Rising Sun flag has the same meaning as the German Hakenkreuz flag. Although it symbolizes Japan's prosperity, it may have symbolism for internal support, but it is not good for cooperation with surrounding countries. Please, for the sake of Japan's future, clean up the mistakes of the past.
I really hope Japan makes it to knockouts this year, but its looking difficult.

Japan should have won this.  Poor goalkeeping cost them the match.  No way that first Belgium goal should have gone in

Who&#39;s here after Costa Rica choked Japan 😂😂

Japan lost not to Belgium but the physicality. Belgium coach took a smart step putting taller player to the pitch. There is no way japanese defender could cope with the attacker 6-8 inch taller.

Looks like we will face Belgium in the final tournament this time too 😢
Japanese first 2-0 and belgium 3-2🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
I am now from 2022 and Japan beat Italy 2.1😂😂

I've never been so excited or disappointed in a game like this lol
One of the greatest come back of Belgium in world cup. What a class performance even in the last minute👏 2022 Qatar world cup I am rooting for Belgium again this year

Despite being the enemy, Belgium's third goal was a truly beautiful goal. It’s frustrating, but Belgium was still strong 🇧🇪🇧🇪
W commentator
What a counter !!!

I watch this and Rugby World Cup videos regularly.
Belgium is not that easy 😎

&quot;Lukaku,and here is the winner. O can you believe it&quot;----goosebumps 🔥🔥

This match🔥

We are ready to fight Belgium again.  The soul of the blue samurai is not yet dead.

This is what inspired Blue Lock

🇧🇪🤝🇯🇵I lost, but it was more fun than that🤞

Bekaar match aaaa thu
This has to be the greatest comeback in football history

Best football match in the history

Japan delivered the performance of a lifetime

This game you can see, that you shouldn‘t underestimate Japan. That’s why Germany lost.

Still one of the best match in World Cup 🤯

Japan is definitely great team!

The greatest team of all time.... unlucky to be loosing to France

Doha's tragedy Doha's joy after Loftov's tragedy Even though there are two more games left, they are still very happy.

I wonder if I can make it this time❗️I believe❗️
40M views...!!😭I will not forget this match. 🇯🇵🇧🇪👍💗I look forward to 2022 World Cup.⚽🇶🇦🌏
I am confident that Japan is a good team this year.
Me watching because of blue lock

Don't let your guard down. We suffered a lot in the match against Belgium. Please pass the group stage
It's not time to revisit this video yet. We have to go to the top 16 and compete again and win this time. It's time to look back.
They beat Germany

Japan is the Asian superpower in football.

What a match

Japan had skill not luck in this time.Today, they certified it.(2022/11/23)

This is the origin after all
Samurai Japan has become stronger by incorporating a new wind from this humiliation🇯🇵
I'm so happy that I came back to this video
4 years later, Japan won the game 2-1 against Germany.

Japan has finally avenged this painful loss after their 1-2 come from behind win against Germany.

What a loss

<a href="">0:54</a> the defender should remember this moment for his life.

Pain

Our golden team😞

I remember vividly, when courtois caught that ball, I knew it was a goal for some reason. Everyone in the stands went wild. It was surreal

choke ever
This is one of the thrilling matches in the History of Football, I have ever seen.

Japan had speed but less stamina they couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace

and then...Blue Lock was created

Japan were so close, hope they can repeat some time.

Love Belgium
Courtois passing the ball and Belgium winning is so epic

I had seen death note recently and was listening to its music during this match. I vividly remember listening to the end credits song, it was almost a full moon. I was rooting for Japan to win. I was rooting for the underdog. It almost happened till the end where the result was quickly altered.I often come here to watch this epic match&#39;s highlights since then. Tomorrow the next world cup begins. It&#39;s been four years; time flies.

That vertoghen goal i dont  believe how it get in absolutely amazing header

at the last act Belgium gave them the business

the best match ever

Same

This is the match that made BLUELOCK happen.

This match is Japan's highest point in recent years. Will they be able to break through GS this time...
Japan lost this game bcs they are shortBelieve it or not

all the japan plays and goals give me goosebumps, their fans are really passionate too. this match makes me really want to like japan

In 2010, they lost on penalties and were in the final 16. In 2014, they were at their best. In 2018, they lost in the group stage and lost in the final 16. We still don't know what Japan is lacking in the final 16. What will happen in 2022?
I experienced the best and the worst moments in my life at this game

Respect to Japan, fought their hearts out

how many of us are here after reading or watching blue lock?

I'm glad that Japan is being praised so much, but thank you very much.
at least we got blue lock out of this match

Japan should&#39;ve parked the bus, they didn&#39;t. Belgium responded.

So proud to be Belgian ! We know we won this cup ❤

belgium should just lose

Can I use these video clips

Belgium Shalara
Lukaku played a crucial role in the third goal without even a touch on the ball. All the free spaces in Japan defence was created by him if you notice.

what a match it was.. Belgium team was down 0-2 down in first half totally under pressure..The 2nd half saw a different belgium team taking advantage of shorter Japanese players through putting in air ball in the D box to score.In the 2nd half  poor japanese team was no match before them..

What a shame the enemy is Belgium, if your enemy Indonesia can win 10:0, Japan
As a neutral, the ending to this game was painful. Japan played so well and were clearly the underdog in this game. Had they won this game nobody could say they didn&#39;t deserve it. I also like that there was no dirty play or anything that required VAR just pure football from beginning to end.

<b>This country needs a Blue Lock Project.</b>

And it is precisely from this match that the blue lock begins
They had us in the first half ngl

Hands down the best game of 2018 worldcup.

Thanks Belgium for being the caused of the best sport anime ever.

Japan is a excellent team but Belgium is the undeafeatable gamechanger.

Who&#39;s here because of Blue Lock.

I forgot this Mach but the first when I read blue lock manga I remember it 😂 ..

Blu lock histori

2022

as a big belgium fan big respect to japan for continuing to play the game, simply the best game ever

ngl best game ever
I'm so frustrated... 😢
I want to beat Belgium in Qatar&#39;s final tournament!!To do that, we have to beat Germany or Spain in Group E!!

How blue lock made

I really love watching Japan play, I want them to do well against both Germany and Spain

That counterattack reminded me to the blitzkrieg

Who this commentator? Does anyone who his name?

best gamer ever. nothing is impossible

Lukaku so selfless assist there

So hyped for November

Man its been 4 years now

As a moroccan i will say to belgium see u next november : &quot;we will f**ck u&quot; 🇲🇦👉🏻👌🏻🇧🇪
What a bad memory
Never forget this mach...

Simply amazing!😮😯🏅
This is Yes recibe Jesus Christ salvation personal this Yes recibe in My ♥️🤗🤗🤗🤗
Vertonghen should practice his heading more
This match was really disappointing
I feel so sad for japan.

The japanese was on fire

I am very surprised Japan could hold up this much with Belgium. They both played a wonderful match. Japan should be able to  get further in the future at this rate

This still haunts me to this day. As a japanese i officailly announce that i thre the remote at my screen and it cracked.

Japan deserved to go in to the quater Final.

I hate NASA chadli
TELL THE PRESIDENT OF FIFA ABOUT THIS STORY, BY 2026, OUR VIETNAM WILL BE MAKING THE WORLD CUP AT THUAN MINH COMMUNE STADIUM, IF YOU'RE COUNTING, Mr. FIFA PRESIDENT

HARAGUCHI!!!

I was just wondering, I deleted some older saves from my PS4 FIFA 2018 games folder &amp; kept the last 2 recent game saves, but when I go into play FIFA &amp; Tournament Mode to load up the save, their are no saves, even though the saves exist in the Saved Data in System Storage, what is going on???

Thank you for the video. Can I download the videos uploaded on the FIFA channel and upload them on my YouTube channel?

Japan could beat Belgium for 2-0 asif Korea beat Germany for 2-0

What a fake by Lukaku

What everyone expect from a football match.

Nice match

Belgium tryhard mode be like:

German and Spain waiting in the same grup world cup 🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">1:27</a> is just amazing offense

I remember watching this game and my heart broke when Belgium scored the winner. I was so gutted for Japan they played sensastional

<a href="">0:27</a>Witsel: kevin, help me!!De bruyne: yes
This comment makes the match boring
japan gk should never play football ever again.

Japan vs Germany and Spain in Qatar 2022 🤣

Love you Japan from Bangladesh ❤️❤️❤️
Actually Japan did their best. Many people said Japan had to play defensive after 2 goals, however attacking was the best Defending for Japanese team on that match since Belgium was way stronger team and  they have much taller players.  If you watched the game fully you can found that Japan played so well on this game but also they got lucky as well.

M

best 8...

4 years ago…. As a belgium i will never forget this

I can’t believe I’m here in the same day before it turns into 4 years ago

It is been 4 years ago for best remontda ever

This is me when I made my year at college💗😆

Like for japan

So sorry to Japan

I don’t know why I watch soccer now if I hate soccer

Iran level with protugal , japan almost beat belgium , korea beat germany , saudiarab beat egypt

One of the best football matches I&#39;ve ever seen in my whole life.

That third goal!This is why I love counterattacks..🔥

Okay But This Time Japan Will Win World Cup

I did bet around 1000 euro for Belgium

What a game!! I remember this one like it was yesterday, rooting all the way since the start of the tournament for Belgium. What a shame though that the manager played KDB deep vs France for most of the match

i am japan
Japan played well
For Japanese, this match is nightmare. But also, this is the best match I&#39;ve ever watched.

Belgium the best

3:2

European football team use techic because all they score from heading ball benefit of tall players any way they used really nice tactic in the end

bro blue lock will do a wonderful work in 2022

Japan is best.

One of those games whether you know the result or not, you love watching over and over

Belgium&#39;s entire team pretty much do or did play in England. Kinda interesting

Korea vs Germany and this match is the interesting one

Germany and Spain never think they can easily beat Japan in the World Cup.Of course, both countries have a history of football more than Japan, and the results they have left are amazing.　However, Japan is definitely stronger than Russia and South Korea at the time of 2018.

The  Vertonghen   goal  can be  easily avoidable  japan  made  a  mistake  was  there

They should&#39;ve parked the bus

Notice how low that ball stayed the whole time in the counter attack

Japan was better

cmon belgium55555

Single ethnicity🇯🇵 vs. multi-ethnicity🇧🇪
What am I saying I thought Japan was going to win

I thought patrician

That was a very cool

heartbraking

How can Japan ever win in a match with Belgium? There&#39;s no way. No Asian country will ever win a world cup.

Thanks to South Korea 2002 with corrupted referees. VAR was born 🤣

<a href="">0:16</a>

I watched this game over. If Japan had played counter attack they would have won. Their open style hurt them in the last 25 mins

Still searching and watching this clip in 2022 june..... beautiful match so far.... awesome play

Belgium is the best
What it remarkable comebackBelgium 0-2 Japan but for nowBelgium 3-2 Japan Belgium has 3 goals to win

I was rooting for Japan this was a great match I hope they will so even better in Qatar!

This is a game that Japan will never forget.How they managed to get 2 goals past Courtois is a mystery to this day.

was a fire match

The last minute goal🔥🔥🔥

What a comeback!

Good match! It makes me happy to see you happy ☺️
Im Belgium
Reassembled
The 3rd goal was a really perfect counter-attack. Excellent.
🇩🇪's neighbor eliminates 🇯🇵.
Japan is best contry of asia.i love japan from korea🇯🇵🇰🇷🇯🇵🇰🇷

I often come to watch this video, but it's still frustrating.
P

The Japanese trotted underestimated the red devil
It's like the Japanese have to realize their defeat
lol japan lose

<a href="">1:24</a> I get goosebumps every time I see it
The Japanese do not know malicious play or what is called wasting time... They opened the field to Belgium and took the match
One of the legendary matches in the history of fifa world cup

i knew it was over when De Bruyne got the ball in the last minutes

Japan🇯🇵 will surely beat Spain 🇪🇸and Germany 🇩🇪in Qatar!!

Belgium didnt win that match, Morocco did😎

This match is the visual representation of the fact that height does matter.

As a Korean, it is a country that has the most hostile relationship with Japan when it comes to international matches, but I cannot criticize Japan when it comes to sports manners. At this time, I praised Japan because I thought Belgium was the favorite to win.
It&#39;s too sad to see a large hoped team lost 😞

You play very well
Inui’s goal was amazing💜

The last counter was to grab Lukaku's clothes and stop him. He should have stopped him even if he got a card.
Love from BANGLADESH

Duc Phuc's singing style always pleases everyone.
The trully drama when the king of asia finally lose their win

Lukaku was everything in that final goal ...2 decoy runs  that sealed the fate of japan

Amazing game

I couldn&#39;t stand up when the game was over... It was really tough to go to work that day...Japan was 5AM then.

could have won a lot of money that day....

2 Belgian born Moroccans that at some point represented morocco score the winning goals. How great is that we meet each other in group F this year

last offside
I still feel Hazard deserved the golden ball more than Modric

That vertonghen header is one of the most odd, satisfying and amazing goals i’ve ever seen.

Japan deserved to win

Japan is the best team in Asia and Japan is definitely way better than South Korea. Much respect for Japan from France 🇯🇵🇫🇷

Despite losing, hats off to Japan. They had an amazing world cup

I’m from belgium

Courtois cracked
E

&quot;Cortuis simply grabbed!It&#39;s time for de bruyne to lead this attack..De bruyne passes.. Lukaku... !!!!Oooohhh ! Can you believe that...!!! Nashir Chadli strocks Belgium into the quater final against Brazil!!&quot; Iconic lines!

The best matches in World cup 2018

Respect for Japan

This is how you play a game, you don&#39;t just sit back and take strike after strike, you try to get more! You played great Japan!

For the fair Belgium won Japan

People who are truly as talented as fortune will always have good luck in public life. For example, VK Loc's family, VK Loc's parents and family members are really gentle, warm and good-natured.
Belgium&#39;s Next Match is Equal to Courtois Carrier I mean only that match he was perfect Goalkeeper 😑And when he came to Otherside of Madrid we shouldn&#39;t talk we all knows

Nacer Last Minute Goal will always be in Opening of Belgium&#39;s Football and FIFA world Cup Opening seen Marci Chadli 😅 De Bryune Taking ball from  Courtois is Unbelievable I guess he forgiven him

thank you
if only japan wins

One of the best matches I have seen in World Cups.
best soccer match in the last 4 years

One of the saddest World Cup games in the recent history.

I support both team..but Belgium counter attack is best..❤❤

I hope Japan will definitely beat Germany.
Belgium tactics is : high balls and perfect crosses beacuse japan players hieght

I wish Japan won tbh, they deserved it more 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤝🇯🇵
They should have parked the bus and play defense. That coach of Japan should have been fired after the game.

I was so sad for japan. They just crumbled on defence everytime.

It is not Belgium who won, but the Arabs! Shazly Filali are Arabs!! Arab players always give victory to Belgium and France

Japan played the best and Japan deserved to win
I was rooting for it because it was Asia, but it was disappointing.
As a fellow asian i will root for japan in 2022 wc as well

Just take a look on Chadli run in the third goal

Belgium just spamming crosses to Fellaini.  So average.

And here we are.... Japan and Belgium might have a rematch in 2022..... If in the smallest chance Japan makes it out of the Group Stage

I&#39;m sorry for Japan for losing to Belgium 2-3 but I congratulate Belgium on winning the World Championship qualifiers

so this is why blue lock was made

I can't help but think about what Hazard and Lukaku would have been like if they were playing against each other in their current form. The same was true for Hames in 2014. Japan may be out of luck.
I'm disappointed that we lost, but the match couldn't have been better. It's my favorite match of the 2018 World Cup. Although we lost...Belgium was a really great team I'm Japanese, but I love Belgium and would like to go there someday 🇯🇵🇧🇪❤️
Belgium's third goal...got it down
Such a shame Japan didn&#39;t win. Respect from the Netherlands!

The last of thee amazing Eden hazard

Yay Japan lose I am korean
Japan until 2-0: It&#39;s like a dream!Japan by 2 - 3: This must be a dream.

Lukaku right 👍
Do we have to relive the bad memories every time we look at the final counter?
Last moments nasir chadlie running💪💥

Ahh cant see japan vs brazil like captain Tsubasa series😅

Japan really made whole Asia proud. Asia should learn from them.🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵 🎌🎌🎌🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵

🙏

🇯🇵..🇯🇵..🇯🇵... rising star of Asia
Japan here we go to WORLD CUP😊

He was giving a lot of trouble to obvious superstars like Hazard, De Bruyne, Lukaku and Courtois. I hope to see more great games like this again this year.
I&#39;m Japanese, but it was a pity that Belgium lost to France rather than Japan lost to Belgium.

dope match

To be honest, Japan is very good at soccer at this level. However, despite this, I think that the reason Japan lost to Belgium in this game was probably because of physical strength. What I have felt while watching the World Cup and Euro Cup so far is that European kids have something in common. This means that they are much better physically than Asians, for example, in terms of height, body, legs, feet, thighs, etc... If Japan had been as good physically as Europeans, I think Japan would have won this game by a long way.
Japan clears up its humiliation at this time
Great comeback from the Belgians
Any Blue Lock fam here?

Soooooo sad

Sis Febri and Sis Edward celebrate Rizki's goal minute 48 Fateh minute 52 Belgium's goal in the last 16 of the 2018 world cup Sis Febri and Sis Edward failed to say that their team had passed the final quroter Rizki and Jason and his friends had been eliminated after losing 2-3 to Belgium
Japan not only didn&#39;t defend but also stopped attacking when Belgium was getting aggressive... So it seems more like Belgium just underestimated them in first half

.

one of the most dramatic games ever.

Japan deserved to win that match :(
bad japan battar

What a comeback

Crazyyyyyy I remember this like yesterday

Japan should play defence

It’s refreshing haha
nice 👍Japan 👎
Who&#39;s this commentator?

Gyokusai! I regret it!
Fact is, they scored more goals then France played against belgium

🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪  was gonna win
I really don&#39;t understand how this last goal ended up on goal of the tournament

Wow what amazing performance to both sides but dang i really feel bad to Japan

Soccer isn’t my favourite sport but this match between Belgium the men in red and Japan the men in blue was just pure gold

Infantino, you are Putin&#39;s friend. This is a great shame for you and FIFA! You are putting your hand to a great crime against humanity. This is not soccer! You are ruled by unclear interests and dirty blood-stained innocent people murdered at the behest of your friend Putin!

I never thought I would be able to have a dream against Belgium.

One of the most very best comeback in world cup history

Love You My Favorite Team Love From Bangladesh🇧🇩 💖🇧🇪😘
WHAT A GAME, what a great game 😮💯👌
It's a shame, even though Japan already wants to qualify for the top 8 of the Asian country teams
Kevin de Bryune passing so awsome👍💪
Japanese team always had subpar goalkeepers in history, if they can find a half-decent goalkeeper and a solid striker, they can go much further.

I&#39;ve never seen any polite people than Japanese 🇯🇵

The best game I ever watched live

time for de bruyne to lead this attack⚽

Japan's strongest!
Japan lost because they had REVERSE ANIME POWER UP effectHad they been trailing They would have won

Japan lost because they had REVERSE ANIME POWER UP effectHad they been trailing They would have won

Japan is really strong. In fact, Japan is the only Asian team that can compete head-to-head with the golden generation of Belgium. Moreover, I admit that it is amazing that they almost took the game not only by playing defense but by leading the way.
Japan will be dangerous in this year World Cup ( if they qualify) they caught the number 1 team off guard

Can i just say that this World Cup was amazing

Epic Comeback

The two points they scored here became a big hope for Japanese soccer, and the three points they scored later became a major challenge for Japanese soccer. I think the value of this one match was quite important for Japanese soccer.
Japan did mistake, they should have made a foul instead try to play clean to stop it for the winning goal for Belgium

🇧🇪 ⚽⚽⚽ X ⚽⚽ 🇯🇵.
Belgium struggled this game.

Loser Japan😂😂
aowkaowk at the comeback
Belgium 🇧🇪 They were really strong and my favorite team! If we have a match in Qatar, I will get my revenge 🥺
It may not have been a winning run, but the switch to defense was Japan's biggest issue in 1993 - It might have been better to immediately insert a defensive midfielder into the midfield (^▽^;)
LoL..... 🤣
This was the superb team game Japan vs Belgium.💞💜💞💜

As some one Japanese it’s devastating

I thought I won
Belgium is bettr0

<a href="">1:30</a> look at the Japanese player in front of the Belgium player, this defense does anything!!

It was really sad
Japan😂😂😂😂

Last goal was so smooth

What a goal fellaini scored here and against france

A great match

Asian team 👎👎👎👎👎🤣🤣
Best game in the tournament 🔥🔥

Still the best match of all time. Rooting for Japan but great game Belgium.

Japan played great and they deserve to be commended!!

Felt sad for Japan
Fellaini gei &gt;:V
🇧🇷 BRAZIL 🇧🇷
Came back to watch because of the anime &quot;Blue Lock&quot;.

epic comeback

Belgium was too strong. I love Shinji Kagawa's play.
I can stop watching this🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿

cool.

The fact that I’m half Belgian and I love Japan , it’s hard to chose a side

Japan 🗾 asian 💪
What a comeback for belgium!! Top notch

No diving, no whining, no cards, no cheating from both teams. Football can be a freaking beautiful game.

Im half Japanese and this broke my heart

Asians will never be the greatest in football
Asians just play badminton..mah..they give the ball high in front of the goal and it takes a long time to break..😂✌
thrilling match

<a href="">0:23</a>　I am Japanese. OK, I&#39;m back.
Best Match Ever...

the most important part of the counter attack was lukaku leaving the ball for Chadli.

Wow Respect is 🇧🇪

Trust me, a few moments later, a country in Asia will win the Fifa World Cup
Football is also tactics, something that the Japanese team didn't have, as they had to defend themselves, tighten the team. The important thing is not to play nice but to be victorious. Greetings from Brazil.
Belgium are amazing I hope they win the world cup final or atleast make it to finals or semi finals 🇧🇪 and for Japan better luck next time love you from jordan🇯🇴♥️🇧🇪

What A Comeback From Belgium

Wow

WHAT. A. GAME

I predicted that moment

Congrats to Belgium, love from Qatar

Japan is really improving

Great match

Loser
I can watch it over and over again, but every time I watch it I feel nauseous.
My motivation match, look at the last Goal is 💪 tremendous

They should made a statute of lukaku in Belgium for the great assist he made.

I still remembered this today Japan almost win but unfortunately Belgium take the lead.

EPIC COMEBACK

love japan
One of the best game in footballing history

that last belgian goal was a practice drill.......

miao
Crazy Match
Respect to Japan

Soccer is for the living and the Ponjas were innocent and always tried to play the right way.
♥️ GLORY TO GOD ♥️🙏.
On this day, I cried for the first time in soccer.from japan🇯🇵

Japan is best asian team  they have some skills

BELGIUM🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪❤️
Worst goalkeeper from Japan

My heart breaks into pieces when Chadli scores, but Japan earned everyone&#39;s respect at this World Cup including me.

I saw this match in live.epic match it was.this is called football.anything can happenat any time.both Japan and beligium gave their total best to win🔥.but special mention is lukaku&#39;s leave.thats genius presence of mind🔥

Whenever I feel sad for Japan watching this, I watch Wales beating Belgium at euro 2016 to cheer myself up.

123🇧🇪🙂
That last goal👌💞🚩⚽🔥🔥🔥
Japan brought us som real entertainment
Best game of the World Cup!!

Belgium is impressive, it deserved to win the FIFA WORLD CUP, although INUI's goals were not bad
Prime Belguim, i miss it
Japan and Tunisia are the only teams to score two points against Belgium, which has the strongest team, so I think we can be proud of that. And a battle that reminded me once again of the vastness of the world.
This is the real thrill of sports

This WC was crazy. I can&#39;t wait for next one. I wish Poland will be there too (but propably they will lose with Russia, you know, politics).

<b>JAPAN NO.1 ASIA!!! 🇻🇳❤🇯🇵</b>
That heading goal should not have happenned

Now I think Japan deserved the win 🇮🇷

The best match cup! Japan in the next cup go champion!

Me after 3 yrs 😅
<a href="">1:21</a> to <a href="">1:36</a>The best 15 seconds of the tournament

Japan thought they would pull a Inazuma Eleven on Belgium

I felt very proud of Japan at that night. What a night!!! I&#39;m not even a japanese

Asian team never go to quarter final😅
Always come here once a while to smile 😊

My respect for Japanese team.

One of the best World Cup matches ever !

On a me du ass!
This match defines RESILIENCE

Any football is uncertain/Even if you lead 3-0, don't be happy/Because he will chase you until you win 4-3, I've seen it a lot.
Who is watching this masterpiece 11/11/2021🥰

After first half:Japan: haha easy winBelgium: I dont think so

IS ANYONE VIETNAMESE?
Perfect commentary puts some extra icing to this.

party
Japan may not be able to participate in the 2022 World Cup.
<a href="">1:27</a> Hazard couldn&#39;t even follow Nacer :-))))))

+1 Respect for Japan

No matter how many times I watch the winning goal, I never get tired of it haha.
hahaha hentai vs human
:)

Which commutator is this

It's frustrating to remember this game now, but it was the best WC match in the history of the Japanese national team.
Belgium won the match but Japan won hearts

Football is a beautiful game.

It was for Japan. That was the game... In reality, I was so close to reaching a higher place in this cup. This Japanese team was very good, but it also faltered a lot
wow

they are very bad
GO JAPAN WIN

did not deserve defeat Japan 🇯🇵 😭 greetings from Somalia 🇸🇴
japan blew this one up 2-0

no kicks and punches like Korean

Japanese played very well respect Japan and Belgium

Nations League 2020/21: Belgium got from France what it did to Japan 3 years before LOL

Vertongan&#39;s header is the best header I&#39;ve ever seen my entire life

<a href="">1:24</a> what a damn counterattack!
America first, but Belgium is my 2nd. I will never forget this game

Is fellaini fuh me😭😭😂🔥

Courtois must be given more appreciation for that quick reaction and pass for that last goal.

Sometime karma gonna happen lol .. and the blue team was france this time 🤣

Fellaini saved us so many times man should get more respect

Amazing match from losing to winning in the last minute. Congrats Belgium!

2018 : 🇧🇪 3-2 🇯🇵Japan were 2-0 ahead, Belgium made a incredible comeback to defeat Japan 3-2. Japan lost in heartbreaking fashion. 2021 : 🇧🇪 2-3 🇫🇷Belgium were 2-0 ahead, France made a incredible comeback to defeat Belgium 3-2. Belgium lost in heartbreaking fashion. Belgium got a taste of their own medicine.

This is sad tbh

france - belgium game of october 7th 2021 is quite similar to this

time 800 I&#39;ve watched this as a Belgian and boy that lukaku step-over still gives me goosebumps

beautiful match

the best game in football history💐🇧🇪

Korean thumbs up
This was the first time I shed tears over sports.
That was an amazing comeback, but man it was heartbreaking. My place went silent at the Belgium&#39;s third goal.

Japanese people celebrating goals of Belgium 😌

The best match of the tournament aside from France vs Argentina tbh

Lukaku finish japan 😂😂😂
&quot;There is just time for De Bruyne to lead this attack&quot; If I was Kevin, I&#39;d be proud of myself after hearing this in a World Cup game.

This match is really tense
BELGIUM YES YES YES
So this is why blue lock was made

gg Belgium and gg Japan!

Japan dropped the ball harder then WW2 xD

3 _2

❤️ belgian
FINAL GOAL: Mesmerizing to see Shoji on a DEAD RUN from the instant Courtois releases his throw until Chadli directs it home ... all that hustle and he was one step short.

Best match comeback

I rewatch these highlights every year. How did Japan throw away a 2-0 lead with about 15 mins to go? WHY did they not just play a short corner at the end and keep hold of it? An exciting game but Japan really threw it away.

I was really disappointed at this time
FIFA 2018 best comeback ever
This match captivated the world.  Japanese soccer was great.  Belgian counters are first-class.  Anyone can see it.  It ’s truly world class

most love game

It’s the power of a single-digit world ranking and an instant gear change.
What a sensational comeback goal in the last second
This is why I love football, anything can happen at any time

I’m Belgian &amp; I feel bad for Japan

Respect for both of them!

Japan is Asia Tiger.

Jan vertoghen
What a asian nation🥰🥰 we will conquer one day😍 Ins hallah

De Bruyne&#39;s role in the counterattack is so underrated. Collecting the ball from the man who stole his girl and running halfway through the pitch with blistering pace, then laying down that scrumptious outside the foot pass

One of the best match

Olympic, soccer , basketball, gaming   hi-tec, why&#39;s allways japan in it ?

Japan 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Japan should not have sent so many players forward for the last corner kick...

%%^

I think this is the most beautiful counter in football history from Japan👏👏👏👏

Never ever it&#39;s the best match

Nooooo japan

Blue Lock

Everything about this match was simply awesome including commentary

I still get chickenvel if I kijk this again

It really made me dream. Please do your best next year as well. I'm rooting for you.
won the championship, it's great guys, you guys are the best
My favourite game 😂 Belgium

<a href="">1:21</a>

Get your revenge at the next World Cup!

If this match doesn’t tell you “never give up “ I don’t know what will 👌👌👌

Almost killed the giants.....Next time japan ❤️.

Japan keep attacking and weaken their defense even after 2 goal. Big mistake.

Can’t believe this happens 3 years ago time flys

Japan we&#39;re underrated they literally almost defeated one of the best contender for the cup

Ven super campeones

Belgium to Japan: OMOE WA SHINDEIRU.Japan: Nani?!!?

Ngl Japan played better than Brazil on the World Cup. Is just the defense that sucks

From the moment courtois gave it to debruyne ,you feld already that there&#39;s going to happen something.. That attack,that vision..wonderful goal.Endless respect for japan for keep playing soccer and not parking the bus.Best attack in wc history!!

Vertonghen header is so underrated

Japan 2nd goal 👍
Same as Costa Rica

It was a shame 😢
Japan got too relaxed after that corner 😌😌😌

If Japan beaten Belgium, Japan could go to semi finals in their first time in history.

Japan should win this match because they deserve it..

Beautiful

Awesome come back and you know Kevin  actually send me a message

it so fun watching old world cup highlights

VOOR VORST VOOR HEILIG EN VOOR RECHT RETEKETET

Slow and steaty wins the race!

<a href="">1:54</a>

This is the 5th best game of the World Cup

How is the commentators name?

Don't go get Yamaguchi
Despite this being 3 years ago. THANK YOU BELGIUM from an Indian national football fan

Japan....fav country ever....❤️❤️Love from india
I remembered today's Olympics and came to see it...
There are games that remain memorable even if you win, and there are games that remain memorable even if you lose. This battle to the death will be remembered for generations to come, and I feel blessed to have been able to witness this moment.
BEST GAME IN 2018

This threat technique, guys
If Belgium 🇧🇪 would have lost to Japan,that would shock the world

🇧🇪 3 - 2 🇯🇵
One of the best games of the tournament!!!

Yoooo that last attack gave me chills.. attack mode all the way ..unruly

Japan shouldn&#39;t keep the goalkeeper to the knockout stage. His reflex was too slow, most of the loses was his faults as well

I'm looking forward to the next tournament in Qatar, but for some reason every time when Japan has a high reputation, they lose in the group stage...
Luke &amp; fellani❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When life was better 🥲

comeback

What a comeback from Belgium 🤯🤯
Next year, i want to see Asian team at the top of the group and winning the world cup

For me this is the most historic comeback
Bro they almost won

Belgium is never easy the counter strike of them has made the biggest team&#39;s of the world cry 🇧🇩🤍🇧🇪

Really it&#39;s a great match.

Love Japan! Love Belgium! Love football especially the world cup! Love Sport! This was such a beautiful game that produced the best kind of drama: Respect to both teams!

This was one of the historical match in FIFA 2018..!

Best 2nd Half 😂

Woulda been so cool if Japan won 😔

Well done Belgium!!

Vertonghen made a mistake in this game and didn’t clear the ball against Italy leading up to the goals.

Yes belgium won

best game of Belgium&#39;s history

Great great game. Glad to see them in the Olympics

As a Belgium supporter, I totally respect the Japan&#39;s football and I hope they can be a strong team in the future because they have the potential! WHAT A MATCH

It was a beautiful counter
This defeat will make Japan stronger again🇯🇵

What a bad defense the Chinese have Kjjjj
Proud to be japan for Wel played congratulations to Belgium

Only one asian team who is fighting there l love japan from india.

<a href="">0:24</a> Kevin just chilling lol

Rooted for Japan after Mexico got clapped just for them to choke

Japan really played a fair match, but Belgium did an insane comebackI respect both teams

Playing with high ball does the trick in Second half for belgium.. And here comes the super Head man.. Felaini 😂🤣👍

Respect+ for japan

It was foolish from japan to not play defense

After a 2-0 lead. I’d definitely be seeing my team in the quarter final. Too bad it was taken away

Wish i had bet on Belgium after Japan was in Lead 2:0 😲🤑
I come back to watch this every now and then and each time I do, it&#39;s all goosebumps 🥶

It was one of the greatest matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals. Belgium 🇧🇪 &amp; Japan 🇯🇵 played a match for the ages.

It was a beutifull game  ever

Can&#39;t wait fifa world cup 2022,because japan have new player,kubo and minamino

I always cry when I watch this match
That last minute counter attack has to be one of the best in football history.

<a href="">1:35</a> Shivers. Absolute shivers.
Japani boys have short height so they have some limitations. If they remain similar to all other nations, they might have a real chance to win world cup. 😔

To be fair, credit to Japan. Not only did they finish 2nd out of Poland,Colombia and Senegal. They scored 2 goals against Belgium who were one of the best teams in this competition.

You gotta feel bad for Japan
Best match of the tournament

JAPAN

still remember that day, I supported Belgium😊lost hopes till the 60th minute but after that they rocked🔥 this was one of the best comebacks I&#39;ve ever seen

Hats off to Number 3....

A beautiful game of Football ❤️ Probably the best match of the tournament. Love from Pakistan

Not deserved pay for fraud
If anime football character,s are real than Japan will win

Best football match I ever seen.. great respect for Japan 🇯🇵.. love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩.

Party
No joking i am Belgian but this is remaining in my memory for ever and ever .  We played way better then then we did in 2021 EC cup , we deserved our cup there , only France did get in our way . I do believe we were at least equal to France , just part of luck on their side. IMHO in EC we did not stand a chance , not against Italy , but also , not against Portugal ( which we won by luck ) . 2018 was the best we ever got , and it will take long long time before we will get that quality back .

If japan won Brazil would have won quarterfinals

One of best match match, most surprising

Have to feel for Japan - heart breaking for them, but that Belgian winner was a masterpiece.

Lukaku leave is the best thing see in goal

One of the greatest comebacks

I watch this match lot of timesWhat a surprise

Japan is the most underated national soccer team.

As a asian i got hurt in the last. Japan should have been defensive after scoring 2 goals

Familiar scoreline, but this time we can&#39;t come back 😭😭😭😭, Belgium aren&#39;t the same when kompany and fellaini is gone after all.

Chadli your 😂
2-0 against Belgium on July 3rd was nothing but exciting.
Unlike Japan, Italy wasn't as sweet lol
Anyone here after belgium got knocked out of euro 2020?

Watching while belgium are down 2-1 against italy in quater finals in euro 2020 we need another comeback

It&#39;s a disastrous game for Japan.

vertonghen just keeping calm even though he got a brilliant goal

This painful day has come again this year

Was not inazuma eleven, sorry
The best comeback

Takashi inui shot always like that

It's hell to watch after scoring 2 points lol
That Japan goal keaper need to improve

3 years later still heartbreaking

If japan had a taller keeper they would have had more of a chance

That was best mach play

It was worth getting up early in the morning.I remember it now.
japan may have played very well, but their players were very short. no wonder how belgium scored 2 headers so quick.

I love this match

belge is trash
If Japan had passed, Brazil would have advanced because Japan is Brazil's customers
Jav the best

BELGIUM BELGIUM
It is Belgium...

It was a disappointing result as a Japanese, but I enjoyed it very much as a football fan！

Japan&#39;s up to great things in the world cups to come. Great playing, amazing fans.

As someone relatively new to football, this is the best match i ever watched live. Why can&#39;t every match be like this. Just two teams giving it their all. No backhanded tackling or injuring eachother. Both sides play the game and show brilliance while doing it. It took probably the best counter attack i have ever seen for belgium to win this one. Probs to both teams.

To this day that last goal still gives me chills everytime i think of it

Nacer Chadli going full blown Usain Bolt right there :p

Belgium🇧🇪 is the best.

My match of the tournament cannidate 4.5 out of 5 star match

Hairy coochie 😆😆😆
<a href="">0:50</a> Man if a couple bounces went Japan’s way there

Japan could’ve played defense after they made 2 goals, but they didn’t, they decided to play football and for that I will always have great respect for Japans team, love from Belgium 🇯🇵🇧🇪

Japan deserved to beat Belgium, Belgium have always been arrogant.

I guess you could say Belgium were... HEADstrong in that comeback.

In fact, Japan and Belgium have played 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses so far.

Most dramatical game

apparently this was the first time in world cup history that a team managed to win within 90 minutes after being 2 goals down in the second half!

Amazing run from lukaku in the last goal, pulled the defender in to allow meunier open

Hope Portugal have taken note of this....

order me chinitos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Japan lost the game, but they won our hearts.

i love japani i love japan
<a href="">0:53</a> the main mistake of the first goal is that the one who covered the ball was afraid, there you see it
Japan could have easily won this game after going 2-0 up. Belgium didn&#39;t really win it, Japan lost it. They just keep on pushing forward, instead of managing the game.

amazing game but this was heartbreaking

This game was a perfect demonstration of how far Japanese football has come and how far it has to go to be a top footballing nation. Japan technically are on par with the best nations but are still lacking physically (this gap is closing now though). They still need to get over mental barriers and not to have inferiority complexes against big teams like Belgium. The current team now is more talented than the 2018 squad and the Olympic team look very talented, so the future is bright for Japan! They might win gold medal at home😉

Almost forgot to watch this masterpiece today

Over confidence beat Japan

Still feel bad for Japan

Can anyone help me telling the name of this commentator!Very curious to know

In 2018: cryingIn 2021: Still crying 😭Huge respect for such a perfect goal... from Japan

Please tell me who is the commentator of the match?

this game was so awesome, I still remember it!

In that match i got lot of shock for Japan because i am only Japanese supporter from childhood..

So beautiful match. What we wanna see

What a game

I still remember the reaction from me and my family that moment whas insane!(iam from belgium)

I'm still wandering around looking for the world line where Honda's final free kick was decided.
Japan is so oppp

&quot;I AM TOTALLY SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO STOPPED TO READ THIS MESSAGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN EVERYTHING HE DOES&quot;
&quot;I AM TOTALLY SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO STOPPED TO READ THIS MESSAGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN EVERYTHING HE DOES&quot;
Japan must remember this game forever so as not to be repeated. And I hope that they break the past.

I remember I was like 14, I WAS CRYING CRYING it was to beautiful 😭😭 🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪
Japan has a GK weakness. How long will Kawashima last? I also hate director Moriyasu. I wanted him to quit as a coach when we lost the Asian Cup and when we lost to South Korea, but he hasn't quit yet.
This comeback never gets old,Goosebumps everytime I watch this😃

That&#39;s my Country ❤🇧🇪
It&#39;s been 3 years ago and I still have to watch this goal every now and then

im still can&#39;t move on from this game , its beautiful

NO 💔 😭😭😭
Respect for Japan from belgium !!❤️

The only Asian can beat Europe team is Japan &amp; Korean

Chadli et fellani made in Morocco
I came here after seeing Belgium for a teamwork goal against Denmark at the Euros 😍😍😍 KDB 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This moment will stay with me forever, what a game!

A very exciting match in 2018.. After being behind by 2 goals till 80 minutes, Belgium won the match against Japan by scoring three goals.. The match calls for the talent of Belgium team members❤️❤️👌👍

Takefusa Kubo was not yet a member of the Japan national team at this time.

My first heart attack

Rode duivels!!!😁I do feel sorry for japan tho man they were 100% certain of their victory

best match

One of the  best  match  from all  world cups

Im Telling you in the whole campaign this game was out of the world

Japan had trouble stopping the defeat🤣 sounds so familiar like the wars🤣

Japan deserved to win, they had a tremendous team and goalkeeper, but for me it was one of the best games I saw in that World Cup.
I'm Japanese and I was rooting for Japan, and I was really happy that I was able to do it at a time when it looked like we wouldn't be able to turn things around, losing 0:2 to an opponent we definitely had to win.
daym tibo pass it to debruyne in last min

Football no worries Japan is still no 1 in entertaining the world (by animes) imo

They lost that match because they were shorter , Belgium using a lot of headers that game

Belgium entered this cup just to piss off Brazil and Japan, they didn't even win the cup
<a href="">1:36</a> thats so clean

World cup classic

Kawashima can't be stopped. He's a dunkman as good as Jeong Sung-ryong. There should have been a generational change in Japanese goalkeepers a long time ago.
What an amazing counter attack from Belgium! Waw

France revenge our Japanese friends. Belgian fries for lunch 😝🤤
Only lost the top ball, but overall really entertained
this game is the best showcase of what the sport offers, hands down.  I remember barely watching it because I hadn&#39;t been happy with JPN in the tournament so far.Whoa to behold, and nearly woe to BEL, both teams gave all fans a match to both enjoy and be proud of

Japan amazing....
This game... the best in the WC 2018 my dad couldn’t handle the second goal of Japan and went cycling 😂Japan thanks for the fair and strong game 🇯🇵🙏🏼

Japan made whole Asia proud

If Japan had a better GK, they would have made it into the semi finals

wow

RL9 playing without the ball

Ahahhaahahahhahahahahahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahaah

Should I pass that path?

Eden Hazard the legend 💯
World Cup 2018 was one of the most entertaining. People are just mad because their favorite teams were out. Thank you, Croatia and Belgium.

Coming back to this legendary match, probably the best of the whole World Cup that year. Japan played such a beautiful footbal, with a great mindset, and put our Belgian players in huge danger, which led them to become absolute beasts for the comeback. The whole game was breathtaking, huge respect to Japan for being the best opponent against Belgium since a long time !

Who&#39;s watching this in 2021?

France did not make the same mistake as Japan
in reality Belgium does not deserve
As a belgian myself i can tell you when that third goal went in belgium went crazy

Asian level
What a shock 😭😭😭 <a href="">0:33</a> 😁😁
I didn&#39;t watch this game thinking Belgium were gonna win easily 😭😭😭

And to think that Brazil would catch Japan...

One of the most heartbraking moments in the 2018 WC, Japan was so close :(

Mantap

One of the best matches in Football history. An Underdog about to win against a fancied super team who are all in their primes and the greatest Belgian team up to date. What. A. Counter. That was the mother of all counters right there.

The match that inspired Blue Lock 🔒
