Typical Bhutiya film of bollywood, not a sequel of the first same name movie.

Hag he is
Assa lag raha h ki hum koi picture nhi balki fear filles dekh rahe hai. Literally, so boring and only horror part is there in the movie no comedy part, no romance part.It&#39;s really one day movie in the cinema. 

Have you seen the scene of 1920 London?
The first part of Bhool Bhulayiyaa was very superhit and I liked it very much. I hope you will like the second part of this movie also. Whatever will happen but a movie that will cost 1 part will not be able to get 2 parts.
