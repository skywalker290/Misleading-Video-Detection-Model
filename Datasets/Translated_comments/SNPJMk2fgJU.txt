@daveuk2012 Not really, it&#39;s not impossible to do this, watch the episode where he&#39;s riding an attack helicopter or shooting a minigun from his hip. That might change your mind.

Skynet here we come!

7104 people forgot to invite charlene to their dinner party

Coming here from CoD?



The enemy could be anywhere and it could be anyone.

So freaking awesome!

go fuck yourself


It is sponsored by the makers of Call of Duty so the point is that the drone is featured in CoD not Walmart. Learn to balance your expectations.

Shit I have seen most of ur vids and this one fuck dude its freaky man

XM25

* and is more than happy to blow it up at the end of the video.

Next time,...........Javelin :P
Dear Santa....

Nice

look awesome... but did you seriously just get that prototype blown up!? 

by   far  ,this is the best  video yet !!  i cant  wait  for the next one !!

shock and  awe  dude !

nope

i am here from call of duty.com (:

The whole video is an easter egg to the next Call of Duty game and the quadrotor is going to be a killstreak. 

Have you ever been shot with one of your guns?

call of duty sponsored this. so i guess we all paid for that

God damn, every year seems to bring us closer to Skynet.

WOW! that thing looks dangerous! 

black ops kinda lame... plus its to oldskool to have that type of &quot;Quadrotor with Machine Gun&quot; even in part 2, come on russian boy what is that really for.. check out my game playsz lol on my channel

how did you get that?

He didnt flinch O_e
please have nice day

Thats the shit you see in the movies



black ops sucks
r.i.p charlyn.

Where the prototype is, after it takes off there is no shadow in the platform

At 2:43, Which platform? ._.

Jkkopouuuuuyhhhhhhhhhuyyyuu7uuyy6yyyq6yhhhhyy6uwuuiwaßueueudruuu
JI

Real...

Check the minute 2:43, the platform has no shadow. And at 4:17 when it&#39;s shooting the car, the explosions of the bullets are going outside. It&#39;s just a fake.



Hence why it&#39;s gay.

Thas ilegal, and you are in the news dude...

Fake

nice effects ! 

how many papers do you have to sign to get prestige edition?

that shit must have been expensive but with cod as a sponser who gives a shit

True or not, it&#39;s really a stupid idea to go in this direction. Human kind is going to the wall with such weapons. A little bit more morality will be welcome in this world. I&#39;m sad.

Wtf

You dont say!?

Where does he got the money for this freakin shit???

FPSrussia, i was never one of those idiots that thought you used special effects untill i saw this video. And i&#39;m still no idiot. Im 80% Sure that QuadRoter was computer animated as well as the explosion at the end



I need one

Oi how could you destroy that baby?! Gah, must have hurt to blow it up ya?

nice CGI effect! You almost had me fooled 

If anyone wants to get free gift cards to or for your favorite places and or itunes or ps3 or xbox points just by downloading apps for free then get the app &quot;Junowallet&quot;or &quot;bamboowallet&quot;and then as you make your account it will ask you for a code, put in (AR1010585)  -- this code will start you off with some extra money to help you get the required amount to buy your giftcard. Ive made $100 so far and the 1st guy on the leaderboards has made $1,776.58. And thats just insane. Thanks.

I wud of nvr blown tht up nd i wud use it for paintball or airsoft

black ops is adding this to new cod

This is from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 homepage. Is FPSRussia in Black Ops 2?

Obvious CGI is obvious.

Omg I want one

This maybe fake but when I blow u up using this in the next CoD...that&#39;s gonna be real haha (:

the mist from the gas can



Ahh... makes sense lmao.
I&#39;m not sure about you guys, but I&#39;m going to be freaked out the next time I&#39;m at a &quot;dinner party&quot; with a gas can on the table.

THIS is why Russia needs vodka

does it come in pink.......sold

How accurate???

Its great but to loud

you my friend are a idiot

lol big fake, but great idea

how could you sneek up on someone when its like Bowowowowo

Why would FPS Russia make a fake video? I personally lost respect for him. What if he starts doing CGI on other stuff to? *unsubscribe*

its on the next call of duty

Fpsrussia have some relations with the next cod and tacitus

Doesn&#39;t bother me if it is real or fake. The dirt comes from the ground that the car is sat on, im not an expert on explosives but im pretty sure there would be some dirt flying all over, like a grenade? But also when it is in the stand just before he flies it to blow the car up, the 4 minute mark the shadows are different between it and him. So an unbiased opinion, not really bothered. Not causing an argument simply pointing out what I saw :) 

fake, take atention in the last explosion.. Obviously is fake..

for all who came to this video from the COD website, notice at 0:15 he says that the technology won&#39;t be out for at least another decade. Hint Hint?



It means that shit is in the next CoD Game



Fail cause theres no likes or dislikes on comments..

sorry but had to call fake on this, CGI with dubbed sound. And turbine spin up instantly, he do not even look at tablet to drive and shoot



looks real to me.

it might be fake todoy, but it will be real tomorrow

the quad rotor comes packed with fresh top soil, to give it that extra awesome cinematic effect Lol.

What are you, high?

That&#39;s even better if they managed to fool me that hard. :&#39;o



Good CGI work.
the quad rotor is real but it doesnt shoot you see in one shot it has lots of kick but when it shows  video its completely stable. the explosion at the end is also fake where does all the dirt come from ?

The CoD website linked me over here. WHAT DOES IT MEAN

WTF !! You muss be the richest guy of the world . How can you sold this millions of  dollar future weapens ??? 



Who else thinks there going to over power this in the next shit storm cod black ops2

new weapon for battlefield 4 and the new call of duty 



We already have something like this.  Its called a drone and they are far more deadly and accurate.

Russians and their imagination when they dont get mw3



that is unreal

Please subscribe to me dteevee

really....really.....



this is the thing from black ops 2



Daam that was fukin bad ass! Fukin rashishkuvils

Strange how I hate Call of duty, yet I&#39;m interested in this hype stuff. The devs sure know how to do this shit...

The dooms day is near Skynet is here!

Neat

that is crazy...

No, this guy is cool enough- reminds me of one of my gamer friends. Keep up the fun dude!

Go to app trailers and type in the bonus code &quot;lee999&quot; and get free $5. This is not a scam I&#39;m just tryin to help ppl out. U get money from watching app previews. I&#39;ve already made like $79. Thank u

I love the guy with his russian accent :P; (not gay)



Wait a minute.... did you just destroy the drone? 

Please be in Call Of Duty...

Lol That was the shit!, I wanna learn to be a gunsmith now just watching that! But Im not that shure of a zombie attack! Alien&#39;s have the craziest Technology &amp; there&#39;s soo many report&#39;s all over the World everyday now almost 24/7 so just incase we all gotta be ready to defend our planet! It may sound crazy but research ufo&#39;s in ur area on youtube Id be surprized if you couldn&#39;t find anything!

that the name of a man made crater on the moon

Am I the only one who thinks this video would be 100 times better if it were an American soldier in an army uniform operating this machine?

Interesting concept.
It&#39;s the card its hands blowing. 

dude that was so cool

lolz black ops 2 is gonna have it in a couple months



Nope. I&#39;m more of a Battlefield player. I own MW3 but don&#39;t play it as much as I do Battlefield. I didn&#39;t know being aware of other games or a certain game made me a nerd on it.

I like how at the beginning theres all the guns on the table...

hi every1 if u are understress i reccomend the following website. search Madthumbs.con

Sorry to break it to you guys, but his name is Kyle, he&#39;s from Georgia, and this is probably fake.

Tacitus?



Not as easy as that bud.

or any retarded G.I. flag fucker

FPS, I think it&#39;s safe to say that Activision is a big fan of your work.

CGI -_-

Oooooh. Sounds like SOMEONE was sponsored by CoD ;)

mad man....

Fake sure but who needs that thing when you can just use a predator drone to drop a 2000 lb JDAM on any card playing commies you happen to take a dislike to.

wtf COD sent me here

Haaa

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

Gun in black ops 2???
the video is shot more professional than usual, and the lighting of the drone does often not look all too real, espacially in the smoke. i think its fake.

2:25 look where the shotis cominfrom



Looks like you haven&#39;t seen all his videos, he destroys everthing.  I&#39;ve seen those shit flying in the mal, with out the gun. Don&#39;t be surprise of this shit

Fake

This is some Terminator 2 shit right here!



lame.

I dont think He wasn&#39;t flying that..anyway.



Notice how he talks about zombies..might be a clue.

did that shit blow up in the car?

russia really sucks



sorry but is fake and gay 

omfg awesome



this sounds like an infomercial.

One of the hands moved in 2:46 ?

Woody&#39;s Gamertag search, and you&#39;ll find him. He&#39;s a good friend of Fps russia

this is so fake, and he isn&#39;t really russian

This will be a killstreak most likely in Black Ops 2...I am almost sure of it. Or an equipment of some type. I know for sure it&#39;s going to be usable by the player in some way

New COD game reference. Check the COD website.

How does this prove it is fake? If anything it proves it&#39;s real :S Plus this legendary Russian is sitting in the background of one of the pictures.

aww come on this is so fake......i expect better form FPS russia

Quadrotors have excisted for quite somet time if you dont know this yet.

can any body say new kill streak

The beginning of skynet.. and the rise of the machines

Can everybody please check out my channel it would really help me out

Looks like a Drone from Killzone 3.

Why did he destroy such a nice thing

is this real lol? how does a young russian guy have access to this kind of technology lol

what u need is a remote aiming mechanism man.

Tough guy.

The controller has the apple logo on the back

chill bro 

I think it is Fake than a UAV Are round abuot  1.5000 USD

The gun doesn&#39;t have a railing system, the flashes don&#39;t look real, 100 rounds is pretty heavy for something like that, I don&#39;t even see a magazine, and if you watch closely the explosion starts in front of the car even tho the quadrotor is in the back seat. But the military is probably really working on something like that just that I have to say that this video is fake

Your fake.

u are an idiot, ofc it fires live ammo not a single FPSrussia videos are fake

Fake

4:28 fuuuuck :O
Yes

im a loyal fan of fps and i have to say that this one is a large pile of unbelievable i dont think that this is something that is real and he will have to go in more detail for this one 

Hahaha it just blew up.

were does he get this shit

Powered by Skynet.

That is some amazing Terminator Skynet tech you&#39;ve got there. You must live on a secret military base. 

who came here for hayashil Give a thumbs up


Okay everything he shot exploded. And the car probably had dynamite in it. I dont think its all real. Yeah it really flies, and maybe shoots, but how is he aiming the gun.

im actually here cause of the call of duty website , respect.

tell me fps russia was that fun?

Lol that&#39;s all you could come up with. FPSRussia is a big phony, sorry Im stating the facts.

Nooo! That is like the stupidest thing ever! The game won&#39;t even be set in the 80&#39;s

omfg, that was the best equiptment that you&#39;ve ever used in a vid, propably the most expensive as well

how&#39;d he get a hold of this?

Facepalm. No receiver, no ejected shells.... yeeeeeeah...
Can u do a acr 6.8 cause i cant find one from you thanks would be good

IM IN LOVE BRO WITH CHARLYN



i know but if you go to the call of duty website it has this video on there and the picture of the tacitus image thats on fpsrussia&#39;s shirt 

-.- 

How the hell is this &quot;fake&quot;? I&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t computer generated... Dumbasses

That thing is fucking scary

NOOO, Its a fucking cartoon!

is this real :D

you know, being a firearm nut and all, these videos REALLY TORTURE ME. Can you get ahold of a MK46 and a Skorpion? Those are some of my favorites, but if you do get ahold of the skorp, be prepared for a LOT of recoil.

its fake why would he break it then if it was real



Even though it not real, the technology exists to make it real, but the technology and fire power needed, you would need serious licences

Share this so it will be on the nest call of duty game 

Charlene ? Is that a reference to full metal jacket ?

lol

The next CoD will be based on prototype weapons still being tested/manufactured. Think about it. Why would THIS be on the official site? &quot;Call of Duty: Future Warfare.&quot; Seems believable(Better be, I bet $10 on it lol).

I hope to god that this won&#39;t be in the new Black Ops game. 

:O



dear santa...

If you did not know fps Russia is premoteing the quad rotor for black opps 2

He lives in Georgia 

it isn&#39;t real lol, its CGI

no, you suck at it.



God, it just doesn&#39;t even look real. It looks like something out of a war movie or something!



I&#39;m not doubting it&#39;s not real, I believe it is, it&#39;s just... wow.

it sucks

Apperently FPSrussian is going to be a character you come across in campain in black ops 2 :D 

fps russia ur real name is kyle right

and u li9ve in california



you just destroyed the coolest and most expensive air hogs toy ever!!!!



Dope

Photo shop its fake totally fake blast

MW3!

faaaaaake -.-&#39;&#39;



fake and gay

Pretty useless if you ask me..
14 thousand dollars so far made from this vid

Okay people he said &quot; its a prototype&quot; and that in 10 or 15 years it would be dont so STFU and stop complaining

not gonna lie that is some pretty good cg

he has got like 23 million views before 

Dear Santa ...

the explosion looks fake

treyarch  

So that somehow makes it real?

I could use one of these because the little bastards keep stealing apples from my garden and I can never catch them.
Holy shit 7 million views.... FPSRussia must be happy as a pig in shit 3arc had him do the vid for them.



you&#39;re **

this is not fake the call of duty site has a link to this 

*cough* fake *cough*

cool video though

The concept is correct but the explosion at the end is fake, very good CGI indeed.

This is so fake

How can you sneak up in a room with a rotor that loud??

Who the hell is just going sit there that shit is stupid.

How does it land?



look other FPSRUSSIA ,this man have too many things!and weapons!not fake!

He doesn&#39;t say that ¬¬

The Chuck&#39;s Norris son.

i think its fake

It is fake it is a secret trailer from trayarch  u notice he says this is my friend youri  which is soaps parter from the war

DUDE BO2 IS GONNE BE SO GOOD 

what if this was in zombies!?

Terminator.
i want one of these

Too fake....I am going to watch a Chuck Norris movie now....lmao

@borrajared They already do this with the Predator drones

It&#39;s skynet we&#39;re fucked!

u forgot the intro!

I think it&#39;s not fake because you can buy a RC Quadrotor in the internet, attach a gun to the hovercraft, program circuitry (chip, bluetooth, etc.) and controls on the tablet (iPads,Tablets,Etc.) and finally plant bombs like C4 (a small one) in the hovercraft and have the detonater in your hand.

@ICONSOUL You&#39;re an idiot. Like all prototypes, they sit in R&amp;D for a few decades then vet released after they have something better in development.

Well, it seems that Bo2 will be in near future. Yay mw4? No thanks

How do you aim on that thing lol

Yeah black ops 2
CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS 2

guys obviously its fake because its an advertisement for black ops 2 which supposedly has this as a killstreak.



It&#39;s good fake video because it&#39;s a real one, see his other video /watch?v=dPZnRZt0iFY&amp;feature=relmfu or /watch?v=MEi_m5jqak0&amp;feature=relmfu

THUMBS UP IF ALI A BOUGHT YOU HERE

that awesome

Shit is going to get pretty real... HAHA

Cry what?


We will see if mr. FPS has a reply to your accusations. Why would he bother doing a fake @ this point?  Prove it ladies

Haters Gonna Hate this is totally REAL you can make it yourself 1. Buy a quad hovercraft at a hobby shop or something 2. Attach a gun to the hovercraft 3. Program Circuitry and controls on the tablet (iPads,Epads,Etc.) 4. Plant bombs in the hovercraft and have the detonater in yr hand 5. Have fun and be safe

the last explosion looked fake.

FAKER THAN FAKE

Nerds
Metal gear 2
Not very accurate...But still cool

I want this metal gear thing to be real so bad

Kerry Motherthinker
Great vid! But one question, if that technology isnt going to be around for fifteen tears then how did you get it and just blow it up? It did look really cool though!

freemoneyplease



Hurry this code won&#39;t last long!!!





Enjoy
Fuck you could a have gave it to me

I know I think the same way I was replying to the guy that said war is a good thing :)

Seemed like the accent was all over the place in this video.

good fake man. ad for BO2 ;)

nice killstreak!

Jeah well I´m NEVER going to visit you ^_^

Are you guys dumb, its so fake. He doesnt even look directly at it when it flies, why would this clown have technology like that?

best video yet
His accent seems pretty fake

I hope the idiot who made the last comment is restricted from ever speaking again!

DAMN! awesome episode!!! you can get your hands on some nifty stuff!

@peppecassone You know most technological advancements come from warfare/tensions between nations right? like the US and the russians in the cold war.

Pause exactly at 3:19 do some of those card have Ace, Ace, Five? 1,1,5?

wtf, i hope the sale of these is restricted at least a bit.

so u teamed up with treyarchh?fuuuuuuu

this is fake

wtf?treyarch didn&#39;t warn us about BO2 , cooooool!

this will be in my top weapons of choice for the zombie apocalypse... CANT FREAKING WAIT!!!

That&#39;s soo epic

Oh, shtuka, nice.
Call Of Duty Black Ops 2 commercial.

fake .............  I fly rc helicopters this just would not work trust me it is a fake

This wouldnt be very useful in the field, its really loud, not very stable when firing and it probably doesnt have that far of a reach with a remote controll and you have to keep it within eyesight

f*ck my birthday past


tiago is with


That is so cool I want on, it would be handy for me and the problems between my sister

/watch?v=x5MZ3IxoG_A it&#39;s a fake guys stop bitching about it

This awesome shit gonna be in CoD Black Ops II !!!

He&#39;s not really Russian, have you seen his other channel? He&#39;s Russian on this but American on the other... How could this be? And, some of your videos look fake.

The shirt is a clue!

whos the IDIOT? probably YOU with your hmmm...MAYBE 40 IQ...without an understanding of Physics....IDIOT

Guys I would just like to point out that even he said that this shit won&#39;t be out for another 15 years. If it was real then he wouldn&#39;t say that. Its an amazing prototype but we know he wouldn&#39;t fly it into a blowing up car if it was real. Its amazing and hope it comes out soon for all the little boys and girls to play with :)

Amen brother someone that has a higher iq than the ones who are marveling at this fakery:)

hmmm whos the idiot here? you with your iq level of maybe 40.....and obviously your dumbass doesnt understand physics.....now whos the IDIOT?

What the absolute fuck.. awesome video

WOW THIS IS GONNA BE IN THE NEXT COD!!

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

Fake or not, its still cool

Any one who understands anything about the mechanics of fire arms, the flight characteristics of quadrotors or any other vertical lift aircraft or video editing and movie magic will see how fake this is yes there is clearly a real model at the start but all the other scenes are faked. If you believe everything you see in a video these day&#39;s just because it looks real you are an idiot!

good idea =]

ur gay

Want one of those for airsoft

looks fake I mean the gun fire

like if call of duty brought you here!

man i love your channel but i gt  to admit this is fake... nice try tho

you&#39;re *

4: when he fly&#39;s over the card game the first time none of the cards move only when they go to the &quot;on board&quot; camera do you see the cards and money get blown away and only in one direction obviously a hand held camera and fan. 5: IF IT WAS REAL AND REALLY FILLED WITH ALL THAT TECH IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND THEY WOULD NOT BLOW IT UP AT THE END YOU FUCKING TOOL!

this looks fake but very good =) 

Yup, Very creative chambro! I like the fact that the device was blown up it up in the end :) war is &quot;primitve behaviour&quot; 

WTF!!! YOU ARE A IDIOT



Real dick.
ur fake 

fake

Nice

where do I begin 1: there is no way that gun would work there is no place for a bolt and the magazine feed goes straight into the back and is made of pvc tubing 2: 100 round magazine where the fuck are those 100 rounds hiding 3: when it cuts to first shooting demo it&#39;s obviously cgi the muzzle flash is so fake it hurts and it doesn&#39;t move like it should you can&#39;t just tilt 20 degrees without taking off in that direction

new CoD killstreak ? XD

Recon Drone with a machine gun?

Idiot



How are you going to sneak up on your enemy if you have those LOUD motors! Your going to be eating and not notice the loud noise from your window. Umm ok?

Shits dope af. Wish it was real just walk in peoples houses the white house be like fwm:)

Yeah, obviously it&#39;s fake.. But it&#39;s still fcking awesome!

HHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYY

i could take that out with a good baseball throw:)



Yes, I was thinking the same all the way. Him saying &quot;self-destruct payload&quot; confirmed it for me, why would they blow up such an expensive piece of technology?

Fake, 4 electric motors able to lift that wight!, pretty uncommon, plus it flys super smooth (almost too smooth)



I call it fake and sponsored by call of Duty to make advertising. 

the lift required versus the firepower would not work......that toy would be shot backwards accord to the &quot;explosions&quot; of the mannikans



FAKE...coming from an active duty militaryman

@Jonedcc No body know but him man

lol how is it fake?

Fake...

it&#39;s obviously fake... cool but fake

Oh right,



&quot;woods&quot; &quot;black ops&quot; &quot;tacitus&quot; &quot;call of duty future weapons&quot; &quot;call of duty&quot; &quot;near future warfare&quot;



Thanks.

Bad ass!!!!

Zombies having a dinner party...

Is not too bad!!!

thumbs up if bo2 brought u here

ending song?
Htf do you get your hands on tech like that?!

Hey if you like fish tanks or are just really bored check out my vids!! Please

Hell yea I want 10 of them how much were do I order

Imanna call fake on this one

Seems fake, on the fly that thing looks like &quot;rendered&quot; or something. Even the camera&#39;s angle is not natural, is different comparing it to other FPSRussia&#39;s videos.

Who else saw the car at the beginning and knew he was going to blow it up?

Yips should do a riot shield

Thumbs up If you are watching this video because of BO II

too bad that the next call of duty will taking place in 1965 or 1970

Damn some really high production value on that shit. Almost looked real in the beginning. Obviously this wouldn&#39;t revolutionize warfare or even be a viable weapon, but it&#39;s fun to fantasize I guess. As for CoD, this shit is nothing new and if this is really all they have for BlOps 2, then the series is going downhill.

follow me on twitter @gringo901 I follow back!

how can you afford this????!!!

Imagine a pack of these coming at you even in a fortified position. All of our anti-air tech is designed for huge targets, and something that small flying at 30mph would be a hell of a shot especially in a war zone

The bottom-left corner at the end even sais enough.

better mic! :D
Awesome!

you should do some paint ball with a sar12

This could be real in the future.this is for black ops 2. Its still kick ass

Lol this crap is obviously fake... u can se that while it&#39;s flying

IT&#39;S Awesome...only problem is...it&#39;s almost too noisy to be stealthy....

The hover disks would also be too delicate to be efficient. if someone DID see that thing coming, it&#39;d be maybe.....thousands of dollars of tech destroyed...and now useless.



Unless, possibly if you were capable of controlling more than one....I hope in &quot;about a decade&quot; or so...that shit is fixed up, because if it weren&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t make a very effective war machine. WELL, that and really super special awesome.

dude it&#39;s fake

CGI beotches

It looks like you filmed in a different location this time.

It Would be better if its thermal sight

What is this scary?
Helicopters are for PUSSIES!

if you dont know who this is you have no youtube life lol

WHO IS THIS GUY?! HOW CAN HE AFFORD THIS SHIT!

Poor YURI
FUCK YEAH!!!! WOOO!!!!

That&#39;s CGI dudes! Don&#39;t be a dummy

Nothing FPS Russia does is fake. Comment something like that again and he&#39;ll have to make another video only this time with you in it. As target.

prove it.

How the heck did the military let you borrow one of those???

Wow

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

Dmitri, please do a video over the M1 Garand, that would be the shit!

Thats some Terminator 2 shit !!!!

Thank you for the things taught us ((Call of Duty))

Dude, How do you know he has no experience at all?

Hes like Freakin One man army!


Not to mention the fact that there&#39;s a direct link from the COD website to his video!

Clearly the quadrotor is CG, check out its shadow compared to the dudes.

black ops 2 bitchh

Look at the tags of this video

fake :( but still cool



America Fuck Yeah!
HOLY FUCK....that car is ugly as shit.

Badass
yo! i coulda used that fucking car to drive my family to fucking church!!

It&#39;ll be in Black Ops 2! Yeah!

i want a shirleen!!!!!

@FPSRussia Out of curiosity, what do you do to the guns after the videos? Keep&#39;em in a warehouse? Re-sell them?

Look at that, CoD is sponsering him. Interesting...

As Fake as my account on FB

it&#39;s been proven in Mythbusters that a bullet can very well curve inside a tube. Go watch the episode.

Here A Gun You Haven&#39;t Used Yet....&gt; Tar 21 :D

Remind me not to lend you my wheels Bro. Stay sharp.

whaaaaaaaaaaa

So is he saying that if we don&#39;t invite Russian people to our dinner party they&#39;ll take out a machine gun and blow us to pieces? 

Officially Freeked out at this point, Anybody else ever read 1984 by George Orwell &quot;Shits about to get Real&quot; 

cool guys dont look at explosions......


EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITA POOOORRAAA
waiiit....FPSRussia, why is some of your stuff you have and wearing on the call of duty website also????

i love how no ones noticed its 3d edited fucking tards 

don&#39;t you think a Predator is still better than this one? Sharlene is a bit noisy because of her quadrotors



That is one dangerous weapon!

&quot;MY FRIEND&quot; i think is fucking EDIT

omg you are in on it, is COD 9 going to be BLOPS 2

this, along with all the crazy shit goverments are doing... nervous yet?

how do i get one of them ?



BOYS AND GIRLS SKYNET IS HERE TO STAY.

Heheh, bet you have one since you said it :D

Man we really need this shit!

this is going to be one of the killstreaks in Black Ops 2.

Tactitus is apart of the secret code what no one knows yet but some people are saying it&#39;s related to the moon.

Download the app called app trailers and type in the bonus code Icantrickshot. After you do that you will be able to redeem Microsoft points or psn with the points they give you!

wtf you blowt up your copter omg:(

Holy fuck that thing is the most impressive piece of technology ive ever seen when it comes to warfare 

Fake but good I can&#39;t believe I am calling it good when it is fake!!!

must be really hard to aim with this drone

.....? I&#39;m

thumbs up is COD black ops 2 brought you here

lol

IN SOVIET RUSSIA, YOU DON&#39;T SHOOT HELICOPTER; HELICOPTER SHOOT YOU.
&quot;My.Friends&quot;

Gonna be sick in BO2!

cant wait!!! :D

The first fake video on this channel :( But it&#39;s good anyway :D

Seriously now you are just trying too hard.....just shoot some guns with ur fake russian accent....thats all you have to do...leave all that CG shit for hollywood...

for your next gun you should use a beanbag shotgun or nonlethal weapons

&lt;3



first video of his that i disliked because of how FAKE it was.

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

The car explosion looks fake

As fake as his accent. I didn&#39;t know the Chevy Caprice was a poplar model in Russia. The gyros on a unit that small wouldn&#39;t be able to compensate for the recoil from the rounds, so stability wouldn&#39;t be achievable. And finally I doubt seriously anyone would allow this guy to blow up a &quot;prototype&quot; just to satisfy you lames.

how?

Look at the botttom left at the end of the video. 



asdf

LIKE SI VIENES DE STAXX

fake and gay



if it is for call of duty?

prestige edition maybe? :p


Obviously not real!  Just look at the gun and tell me where the rounds enter and where the casings exit.  If it was real, the gun would be by far the must advanced thing on it.  His got to make money somehow.

Just tell the truth it&#39;s fake.

Faaaaaaaaaaaakeee

How the hell is that sneaky? It sounds like a New York Subway

This is not a cod advertisement yall are dumbasses

COD makes FPSrussia rich :D Look at the views!

Fuck you sovember, you&#39;re not real!

This could be a real quad rotor with a fake gun mounted to the bottom

mayby

good point

nice thing but dont blow that kind of shit up XD

I noticed this the first time I saw it, and you&#39;re calling me a &quot;dumbass&quot; ?



All right then, thanks for feeding the stereotype.

i want one of those for my birthday!!!

Cgi is looking better and better. I was suckered for about 20 seconds. Fps should have shot off one of his buttcheeks, hahaha

this is not fake!!!! its real the military use these

 

Im dissapointed with Fps russia for making fake vids

You can see the screen-clipping multiple times, first time being 2:03 (top right corner, for those with horrible eyes )

You&#39;d think that being sponsored by CoD, they would of made it look more professional.

But just like their games, they fooled millions into thinking it was good, or real.

CoD fan-base is so ignorant -_-.

Who&#39;s from Call of Duty ?

ofc, but what we see is 5min.. didnt know he was sponsed by cod but that explains it

Check out bruteforcetv on youtube

dude its a Call of Duty killstreak teaser. Don&#39;t believe me? go to call of duty and go to the picture that is there

Bo2 !

It is fake, its called CGI, unless you believe everything you see on tv and in movies is shot in real life... This is all very eaaily done in CGI, shadows and all, what you have to consider is the practicalities and look past what you see. consider points like weight, recoil, and current thrust capibilities of quad rotors and you will see this tech is not currently feasable

why does the link on callofduty (.) com lead me here? CONFUSED

Wow, real mature. for your information, not that i have to justify myself to some little kid, but i havent been 10 in quite a long time,abd yes im well aware that quad rotors exist both as rc hobby aircraft and as camera platforms in both military and commercial use, but the weight of a smg and 100 rounds of ammo along with plastic explosives is quite heavy, more than an aircraft of this size can reasonibly lift. Grow up and do the research and stop believing everything you see on youtube.

Theres no way those tiny plastic props would lift the deadweight of an SMG and 100 rounds of ammunition.. Clearly a fake.

I WONT ONE



Fake and gay

dear santa 



Cool story, James Trollfield.

amazing
correct to "I hear voices in my head, but they speak Russian"
yes I am a troll :3 and finally somebody on Youtube with proper grammar 

smells fake...

hey :) i know you dont do much sniper rifle videos but could you please do a mcmillan tac-50 video is my Favorite gun and it packs quite a punch thumbs up so he can see :)

Sry i rly dont care how i spell on youtube. lol. And English is not my primary language so stfu

its youtube moron, i don&#39;t need grammar. It&#39;s not an english exam

This video has something to do with the next call of duty game if u don&#39;t believe me go on the call of duty website

&#39;&#39;it doesnt even have a technical name yet, so...for now we&#39;re just going to call it sharleen&#39;&#39; lmao! xD

do barret 50.cal
20mm SNIPER RIFLE!
What!

reminds me of a scene in Terminator 3

PROFESSIONAL SELL OUT!  You lost viewer with this fake crap video. Yakov Smirnoff is the better Russian.

The next Call of Duty. Plus Call of Duty hosts images of this Video.

fake... v__v 



Fake

Thanks for proving what people say about your videos being fake... unsubbed 

XD FPSRussia you are awsome love the ending!

i mean how does he get them stuff

Troll or just stupid?

Aa

Pray a rosary every day for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

you should shoot a sawn of double barrel shotgun with dragon breth rownds 

FreddieW delivers again.

you do realize that the shadow would be off camera right? This is because of where the sun is so get over this it is real

I hear voices in mine, but they speak Russian. go to Google translate.
Well one I&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s not real. 2nd if you look at the shadows there is none. So please if you are going to try a trick some one make sure you the shadows are going the same way in the video.  Thank you for a good laugh.

This is just a prototype people!! In the next 15 years shit will get better!

Google call of duty, click the result at the top (the official site). You will see a bunch of images, including this machine, click on the picture of the Quadrotor and press the arrow you will be brought here. It is real, it does exist and it will be in the next call of duty.

I&#39;m talking about reactions, there is no device with faster reactions than the human

movements where many possibilities are evaluated before running, something inato and passing through our unconscious brain so that is accelerated by adrenaline.

also the reason that the drones flying at a distance more or less safe, at this point do not need a fast reation of attack or defense

well i seem to be the 1 person that looked up Tacitus and it was a roman historian. but considering it is going to have a quad-rotor helicopter in it i have no idea what it has to do with it.

What a stupid machine. Loud, slow maneuvering and an easy target.

this doesn&#39;t look very real to me..



silver magum would be amazing a would love to see 1 in action



black ops 2 killstreak

this s not fake it&#39;s going to be in the next call of duty and Tacticus is also something to do with it, i camehere from a link directly from the call of duty website

No need to apologise xD

poor charlyn


IT IS GOING TO BE IN IT YOU DUMB FUCKS!

look in the tags &#39;&#39;call of duty future weapon&#39;&#39;

This camera on the Quadrotor is quite close to the barrel.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING.

super fake ass shit

well listen to what he says &quot;Isn&#39;t going to be out there for at least another decade&quot; so i don&#39;t think it will be black ops 2

only in Russia...... its a bit too loud, don&#39;t you think?

bgggg

watup guys

lol, i came at a crossroad by a place called &#39;South Park&#39;. :p

its a fake 3d model

@fpsrussia  you maniac!!! you blew it up damn damn you all to hell!!!!

if it would be fake it wouldn&#39;t be fake :D

It look so fake :&gt;

look closer, its shadow on the land

if one day there is world war 3, I want to be in fpsrussia&#39;s camp ^^

where is the shadow of this prototype? i don&#39;t think it really exists

FAKE fake fake..It is advertising for COD, but RUSSIA FOEVER BLAT! RUSSIA FOREVER
This time ... FAKE. Sad ...

its  not a fake

Hey FPSRussia, i found this video at the Callofduty website.. How did you get to work with them?

FREAKING FUCKING AMAZING NICE DUUDE!!!!

Nice work overall on the 3d composition, you just forgot to blow the cards off the table in the wide shot with the beast hovering over the table ;P

For all of you who think this is fake, you really don&#39;t know a professional Russian they can get any weapons system you want shipped straight to your door in 48 hours for the right price with no pesky red tape. Hell order now and we will throw in ex KGB operative for no extra charge.

ahuh and the company that designed and built this &quot;prototype&quot;, the same prototype that wont be out for another ten years, will let an actor blow it up for 6 million hits?? seriously?? 

You&#39;s do know this video was made because Call Of Duty Payed him and worked with him to do it right? 



look at his shirt It says &quot;TACITUS&quot; and thats also on the Call of duty website...

Besides this Quadrotor  was build on the spot for the video, how ever it does make a good weapon

pyro*

Funny.... if this is future, i dont want to live in this kind a future :-)

P.s. COD=mario, arcade, DOWNLOAD MONEY $! BF3=SImaulator war and action!

One more thing: Why does USA attack Iran, Iraq, Lybya, Afghan, Syrya and continue.....? WHY ПОЧЕМУ!? USA=NAZI Imperia?
FAKE! Beautiful video montage, but I only liked it because of the inscription Russia! RUSSIA GO!
He know his accent is fake, it&#39;s called ACTING. 

Wow I can&#39;t believe you blew it up it must be an expensive ass piece of equipment

FAKE ... FOR SURE ... not one of FPS Russia&#39; best :-(

You are fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!

So fake

it&#39;s amazing what a camera, crane, and a little bit of computer graphics can do. how come the thing moves really technical directions and hes never pushing anything on the tablet? and it&#39;s 10 year before it&#39;s time because plastic tube fed machine guns haven&#39;t been invented yet.

Cats

I seen some crazy shit

HAHAHHAA,CREEZ.

So fake, just look at the zoomed in shots and the fact there&#39;s no shadows.

he is russian 

QDT will be auwsum

device, already existing within the WP range
What the hell was he saying about it being out in 10 years we already fucking have it. 

The people who make it are called DARPA. And how do you shoot a bullet through rubber tubes

Man nvm this dude is a homosexual

The CoD Website brought me here

Why is he giving us this fake shit? 

WHY U HAVE 2 BLOW IT UP? D:

Amazing video fps i love that helicopter

Swagg
You will be #1 on youtube...

that is boss!



This would make the perfect murder.

This can be TRUE... Add 2 Parrot&#39;s AR Drone+Uzi=this

You just need some skill on programing and electronics

Yo guys, these are all the previews that are in the upcoming Call of Duty®: Black Ops 2

I’m glad that you understand me, dude) after all, insults are made in order to be understood, and it’s more convenient to do this in your native language, don’t you agree? :D I looked, it translates not without mistakes, but quite accurately. Of course, yesterday I got a little excited, and, more to say, I was wrong, because according to the words of one person, foreigners often judge the entire nation... So excuse me, dude, wherever you are from) I generally don’t care what you think about ME, but the country is sacred.
That is the COOL I want one!

this video you sad sack. does it say cod in the title? fuckin fan boy QQ.

This thing will be useless against anything that moves, which is 100% of everything anyone wants to shoot.

You blow that nice little toy??? what&#39;s wrong with you

Nice shot comrade!

for a moment there I though it was real sad it was no!!

... how much does one of those cost? Probably f*cking much and he just pressed the self-destruct... I disapprove of this! 

... Oh and cool vid. 

The only problem about sneaking up on terrorists is that you could hear that thing from half a mile away because to the wasted sound energy

Awesome! !

pretty cool... but shit this can be real dangerous.

omg i feel like in in the fuckin terminator. hah he had to destroy for no one to get it. like the epic fail chopper in the binladen raid. lolol

Terminator is going to be true....!!!!

metal gear solid!!!...them that means snake was real!

this was absolutely fucking insane

Cool dude
Dawmmmm!!!!!!

now i know what im gonna make

i think FPSRUSSIA works for activision 

nice update to modern warfare 3

Black Ops 2 Killstreak!

Sevme

your a fake sellout

thats sexy

he just say &quot;my friend Yuri&quot;??? from MW3 maybe?

Cool as fuk hey man can you do a vid of the 700 nitro express and 950u jdj:))!!!!

Anyone notice how he zooms in on the ace of spades at 3:17. Which is the waw death card for undead soldier



Ghost Recon Future Soldier
looks like the kick of the machine gun may knock its aiming off for the piloteer

Hayashii!!

Black ops 2?

@sluaghter619 dude the only thing that looks fake is the smoke nd yes you can see the thing in the car I saw the corner of the flying thingy so it&#39;s not fake

I can see it when it&#39;s in.... and maybe the stuff is CGI guess I can&#39;t prove you wrong... 

Why the Fuck would you blow that up?!!

what does he call it?

what&#39;s more fake, the CGI or the crummy accent?

shit falling whie he was talking. that was cgi. the &quot;Exploding drone&quot; is a trick of the eye. watch the windows of the car, you can&#39;t see thedrone when it&#39;s in. And the explosion its self had hollywood theatricals added. 

Awsome

LOL so funny, you can tell when the quadrotor goes to CGI, Activision Y U SO FUNNY?!?!?

Very nice and brilliantly made CG.

Not that good tbh...

This shit is awesome. In 10 years it will be completely decked out with with some type of armor so it can take some shots and the rotors will be quite and it may hold a bigger gun and mag. This shit will change the battle field

yo 6.489.248 and counting views this vindeos came out 6 days a go holy shit that just proves COD does lik the comunity because what gaming company go 2 a famous russain on youtube EA would never do this kind of crazy shit on youtube

Dear Santa...

How much did that set you back?

The CIA still hasn&#39;t got this guy? Haha

Very Nice

That shit was fucking EPIC!!! She is a little noisy. Maybe in 10 years she will ride smooth

That explosion looked so fake.

Look up lil man shuffling 2 one omg almost died

Very Awesome as usual keep up the good work.

hey he may have killed Sharlene but at least he didn&#39;t turn into a vegetarian zombie who cannot fit into society because his inverted ways

It&#39;s the Sentinel Prototype! When do you think we&#39;ll be able to attach a sentinel cannon to it?

This MIGHT be on next cod? Hahahah.

Black Ops II \o/

bring it on,ill swat that nat out of the sky,in 5 shots,this is chicken Shit Warfair,

SWEET JESUS!!!


how is he even legally allowed to destroy a military-grade prototype? 

recon drone + rc car + mav.... = this thingy in the next cod?

Nice Killstreak.

wow, you are on the call of duty main page. well done sir



That thing is crazy

All I can say is thats fake

6,823 people CLEARLY are some evil bitches that Charlene needs to sneak up on and show them a good time.

At 4:30 that looks fake as hell.. but its not O.O



Its called Charlene lol. If thats in the game im totally calling it that.

yea

How about we all just stop killing each other?

This is one of the craziest things I&#39;ve ever seen. How/where did you even get your hands on this shit?

at the end of the video he is holding 2 a-a12s and is says a big thanks to my friends the makers of call of duty :D

Kriss Super V Vector SDP 45 ACP Pistol,10 Round  can you show this one

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

it looks fake when it flies



fucking that thing is awsome and fucking scary as shit at the same time 

dum fuck*
yes

Its worth shit you dom fuck!

The credibility was disrupted when he used the word decade, ok, maybe if he worked for like DARPA or something, he could have something like this, but then when it moved and shot it was obvious.

@kwantoon How are u getting mad at guy that just simply shoots guns for fun? Shut the fuk up kid and get off YouTube!

They didn&#39;t look like Zombies or anything

I didnt ask how he did it i said &quot;HE BLEW THE FUCKING THING UP WTFH&quot; ik what he used..... BUT WHY THE HELL DID HE BLOW  THE FUCKING DRONE UP LOL!

I&#39;m still mindfucked how this is &quot;A weapon of the future&quot; but black ops takes place in the 60&#39;s, if the next game is called black ops 2 how is it a sequal? A 50/60 year sequal?damn :x

fake

someone&#39;s butthurt.  it&#39;s not a &#39;fact&#39; just because you say it is, nice try tho.  continue on the bandwagon some more

woah woah woah, how about you just calm down? if you hate him so much, why the fuck are you watching this video?

FAKE

hes sponcered by video games stupid ass

Fake. He doesnt even touch it the enitre vid.

The only thing that is faker than this video is this asshole&#39;s fake Russian accent. When will this fuckstick go away? If it weren&#39;t for all the prepubescent Call of Duty fuckheads, FPS Cockbreath wouldn&#39;t have a following.

&quot;WEAPON OF THE FUTURE&quot;

Cool!

I guess thats another reason to buy call of duty ...yay

That is some amazing video editing. Props, I believed you for the first minute or so :P

@darthmatoro Hell no stupid blackops 2 and its not called that does not take place in the future

Easy, Blops 2 could be set in the near future.

I know most people skip Therese comments but if you could spare 5 minutes and check out my channel it would mean a lot to me

I know. Ost peopl

It&#39;s going to be in black ops 2

How long can this thing fly/operate?

this thing is sick



You can fucking use it now just get ghost recon future soldier and shut the fuck up about call of fucking duty you stupid piece of shit fan boys

It&#39;s cgi. Notice how he said it would be in the next cod game. 

If it was going to be black ops 2 how would it be possible for technology from 15 yrs from 2012 to be in a game that takes place in the &#39;60s?

Stfu!!!!

wheres the ejection port? wheres the supposed magazine??? ohhh fpsrussia you&#39;ve let me down...

Bwah

Is real...????

That is the first thing I said to.

they can tell its fake.

6,808 People disliked this? wtf is wrong with them

fake



its edited i think look at the warp of the trees at 2:03

sTaXx me trajo aqui/sTaXx take me here

SKYNET!!! These things gonna rule us one DAY !!

Ok, now I am all for this being real, but I saw two parts that make me wonder. First when he shoots the dummies on the hill, the quad rotor casts no shadow. Second is when he flies through the window on the poker game you see nothing blowing around on the table. Still great job on the vid.

you know there is a reason to why it is fake... maybe this is a promotional video for uuuugh i dunno... maybe call of duty black ops 2??? :)

.... it was not CGI I guarantee you this much.

SKYNET!

When will call of duty break down and make fps Russia or proffesional Russian a killstreak

Coor Shet!
Unbelievably fake. I expect better from you FPS... You might have fooled more viewers if you would have stopped looking away from the camera, and decided against the appearance if flying through the back window of the car. Thanks a lot for wasting my time.

you don&#39;t say...

I want one of those
I like FPSRussia and all but there is some fake stuff in this vid. The quadrotor&#39;s SMG has a flash hider on it and when it shoots the same consistent flame comes from the barrel. If the weapon was real there would be no to very little amount of visable flame when fired  with a &quot;flash hider&quot; ,especially during the day when its bright out! No spent casings eject out of the weapon either. And like said before, the car explosion looks fake with the hood and doors flying off in a shower of flames.

Nice

Damn thats some good CGI...

Hey get the app app trailers and use the bonus code yearlymole to get 5 dollars this is not a scam this is legit you can get it android and itunes

Just as fake as his shit accent.

That thing may be real but in this vid it&#39;s fake

Yeah. You forgot to spell school right in your username, I can make observations too.

Your an idiot if you believe this is real.

because it was CGI. you really think he&#39;d blow up a massive military investment like it was nothing?

You forgot the capital at the beginning of the sentence. 

wait, are you trying to make a sentence?

We are the revolution. Skynet. Lol fuck if it could be controlled autonomously we are fucked

Epic

how come when the car blew up their is shit flying every where but he seem to not feel it

call of duty sent me here....o my god the next call of duty is going to be in the future O_O

Looks fun as shit. I hope it&#39;s in the next call of duty

not really a stealthy thing if i heard a loud buzzy noise outside id flip the fuck out



ok. I dont think the actually device itself is CG. But some of its movements absolutely are.

cite your work please. i dont really care whether its fake or not, but dont just say its fake without real proof that it is

really? what about that device called a gun, just to state the one obvious fast thing among hundreds 

FPSFAIL!



sharlene is sexy

Great, you just created a Hunter-Killer.

Thats definitely an idea from terminators.  Skynet anyone

why did u blow up the helicopter !!!!!!!????



noooooooooo i was going to ask sharleen to marry me!!!!!!!!!!

that last explosion looked fake

Your definitely the shit! You have the best weapons I have ever seen!

and its supposed to be a killstreak in black ops 2 shame, shame



Wtf

awesome

he&#39;s not even really russian. how long are you guys gonna buy it? his regular voice was coming out on one of his videos where he had a cold and he lives in the US

thumbs up if you actually saw the head roll down the hill!!!

some thing i have learned from fpsrussia, NEVER PISS OFF A PROFESIONAL RUSSIAN

People you are all stupid it says it was sposered by call of duty at the end. Of course it was sponsored. It&#39;s a promo for black ops 2. And yes these things are actually the future unlike what the dumbasses in the comments think. These things are incredibly agile and precise, and they will be AI&#39;s in the future, and just because it&#39;s a radio signal doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t encrypt the fuck out of it.

heh guys...he knows something about black ops 2 on the call of duty website...this video is linked on there..... watch out russia I&#39;m gonna go toy our house and- nah I&#39;m jus kidding please don&#39;t kill me

y dont u crwild628 sutup

FPSRussia Please Give us info on the new Black Ops !!!



I hope theres another prototype

@magodelaoscuridad Wow your comment is filled with fail.

First of all when Charlene goes to the poker game it&#39;s shadow keeps going into the trees when it stops fucking FAKE like your Russian acent

??

would if i could

Lol and his friend&#39;s name was Yuri

like if u came here from cod.com

very dangerous !

ah since this was from the blackops2 website that means it will be a killstreak!!!

I believe the government can turn these against civilians.  They&#39;re already using Predator drones against civilians.

I&#39;d like a video taking one of these out, with only weapons available for purchase with NO special permits, ie. Shotgun, 10 round semi-auto pistol etc etc.

What kind of ammo does Charlene shoot?

Love this machine not only can it fly and shoot but also kamakazi the SOB when out of rounds sweet.

Is that a Black Ops 2 shirt?

wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did you bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt uppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Skynet.

fake and gay

Fakef

Omg..Sub to my channel

CALL HOMELAND SECURITY

all this is pullshit and useless

1.holywood explosion fake

2.useless for combat, you need some explosive to target?missiles there for that and are more difficult to intercept. for spy? satellites are better, for assault? is controlled by a signal and that is a weak point, also if it falls into enemy hands would not be any good, and human body reactions are faster than any device for now

how to land?

it&#39;s cool, i want to buy 1

black ops 2. what do u know wearing a Tacitus t shirt. guys go to call of duty and u will see that Tacitus name is there.

I WANT ONE OF THESE!!

so this is going to be in Black ops 2? pretty impresive

thats some Tom Clancy shit.

An object can be called a vehicle if it transports ANYTHING. It does not have to be people. That&#39;s the colloquial use of the term. However, a UAV carries, or transports, machinery which is capable of obtaining intelligence. Therefore, an UAV is indeed a vehicle.

how much did the quadrotor cost ?

Crazy man
@BGandBW haters gonna hate.
Lol at the CG quad rotor. Where does the ammo feed in? Lame man

How much was it O_O and wouldn&#39;t it be really loud...especially on recon missions -_-how&#39;s that gunna work out?

Fucking awsome

Man for some super advanced technology , that thing can&#39;t even hover smoothly! Entertaining vid tho!

obviously a tie in to black ops 2.

3:48 -&gt; Epic nodding ... :&gt;

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UAV!!! AN UNMANED AERIAL VEHICLE IMPLIES THAT SINCE THAT IT IS INDEED A VEHICLE THAT ITS PURPOSE IS TO TRANSPORT PEOPLE. THATS WHY IT CALLED AN UAS (UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM). IT CANT BE A VEHICLE IF IT DOESNT CARRY PEOPLE!!!

throw a emp grenade then

U r a fcking psycho bro nd btw very good video

Shit just got real

not to be the noob, but dosen&#39;t the explosion look too holywood? 

He always loads up his targets with explosives

i really can&#39;t tell if that was animated or not...



not cool

Coo but proof its fake is the car explosion. A little robot like that cannot carry that much explosives and why would anyone destroy a state of the art prototype (and very expensive) UAV

You should do a Type 95

blatantly fake.

oh hey not so russian kyle.. nice &quot;accent&quot; you have there

Balls

Hey first off he said it will take one highly skilled russian to operate. Soooooooo we have nothing to fear lol.

Fake. 100 round mag? Where? Plus no ejection port. Funny though!

There is no way this has enough power to carry 100 rounds of any ammo, let alone fire and fly at the same time. It flys over the table and playing cards, then back to the table. Only then does the rotor wash blow the cards off the table. Cool video, but a common sense and basic physics equals fake kids.

Thumbs up if you was on the call of duty website and the new call of duty project popped up and you seen that quadrotor on the website



How can it be a cgi when it bounced off the hood of the car twice with authentic sounds?

I do my gay...
...What? You need to just be quiet. 

It&#39;s already in bf3. also: how could you possibly dislike this thing?!

Well it&#39;s real dumb ass do ur gay
He cleary says this technology wont be around for decades...( meaning its a fake video)

is this a joke?!

What can you say but wholly shit!

in soviet russia u dont use quadrotor, quadrotor use u
Pretty cool shit

its true something like that the government would try to hide it 

Cool
It kills me to say this but you would have to be a moron to actually believe this is real... You can easily tell that the helicopter thing is cgi just look at the thing, it looks so animated it rivals the fucking Simpsons and plus this kind of prototype tech would not be posted on fucking YouTube for the whole world to see, it&#39;s madness. Just saying, it is cool though :)

lol



Isn&#39;t it winter all the time in Russia what part of Russia do you (FPSrussia just in case any1 else sees this) live in

This video is bullshit. It was all done by adobe editor. I have a bachelors degree in aircraft maintenance, and I have my air-frame and power-plant certification, with an Unmanned Aerial Systems Operations and Mechanics License from KSU, Salina. There is no way that any quad rotor that size could carry that much payload. It couldn&#39;t even get off the ground.

yeah i was just joke making

It is clearly a fake; guns can not fire from a tube with no receiver.

REAL! :)

no self distruct dnt u hear him idiot?


He puts explosives inside them....

Show the pp90

Yes, i&#39;ve seen that weapon before..... In a freakin&#39; sci-fi movie lol

It looks a lot like a Vorlon.

HE BLEW THE FUCKING THIGN UP WTFH!!!
Why is the helicopter animated?

straight out of terminator 3...

black market? hahaha
imagine aliens or zombies attacking oh shit fps russia will destroy them all

its on cod website :) of black ops 2 :D

i love playing cards with gasoline cans on the table :)

You DO know he&#39;s actually just FPSKyle, some American guy, right? He&#39;s not Russian.

wait was that guy not wearing any pants?? ugh dude, i dont think that was a tea party. and trust me you dont wanna be invited.....

Thing is though, its not from a game. Its real! :O

what kind of camera did you film this with?

Wrong it is something out of Metal Gear soild

Halo, Stuff looks more chunky, MGS one looks Just like it

Make a &quot;setup-video&quot; by showing your weapon spot.

looks like something out of halo



if it is a hightech prototype, and he kept talking about the FUTURE, wouldnt make sense to be in black ops, but idk, just saying



this shit is on the call of duty website. you have truly succeeded in life my friend

FPSRUSSIA, only if you are reading this you are truly Russian... Are you talking Russia?
4:24 James Cameron is not gonna be happy.

do u work for call of duty?

Dear santa...



That was a gift from James Cameron brought from Pandora for FPSrussia.

shut up loser its real

@ZenteXHD  quit talking like you know what its worth

Your freakin stupid

This looks so fake! he drives it so easierly. 

its cgi

kinda looks like its cgi

meh

this will be on black ops 2 :D

this is fake they wouldn&#39;t blow an expensive piece of kit up like that this things well worth over $5M 



DUDE CALL OF DUTY.COM HAD A LINK TO THIS VIDEO, damn fps you are famous ;)

Say &quot;the enemy could be anywhere and it could by anyone &quot; without accent plz FPS Russia 

still nice paste from google 

wow. ghost recon future soldier seems pretty accurate for the future

@FPSRussia ur bad ass man

for a min i thought this was real 

lol:)

I dont know looks kinda fake!



Noooooobs look at tags in description!

cool



Computer graphics for sure.. great way to ruin your credibility .

an extra character for zombies! 5 man / woman co-op lol

it is real???????/?

Extremely well done. It could almost be real.

you actually think this is real?

look at his t-shirt and then go to call of duty.com

So this is gonna be in Blops2? The new RC-XD perhaps

FPSRussia should be a playable character in the next COD installment. &quot;Let&#39;s Keel these beetches!&quot;

Why does the back window of the car blows outwards when shot? And why does the explosion seems to start from the trunk. I&#39;m calling it fake and gay

Look at the beginning, no it doesn&#39;t.

this is coming on the new cod game

yeah okay in a modern day city type thing then yeah but out in the field with wind, planes and, gun fire with protective ear plugs you won&#39;t hear shit and well that thing has a gun so if you could hit it with a slingshot then you&#39;ll get shot shot.

&quot;Charlene FTW!&quot;
you probably were forced to destroy it, the government doesnt want people to see whats out there yet

Looks fack

Fucking epic!

The shadow of the quadrotor is in the same axis as the stand orientation.  The shadow of the russian is in a different direction.



Draw lines on both the qrotor and the russian in the direction that their shadows are being cast.  They are completely different.

black ops 2 was confirmed on friday as the next Call of duty this year

Ok I have seen all ur videos but this one just looks fake sorry

Wow

guys this is not a real ardone gunship or anything like that. You can see the shadow is much smaller than the actual device, and the tablet is clearly an iPad with a fancy case, also the amount of smoke moved by the wind is not even close to how much it would have been blown if the quadcopter had a machine gun attached to the bottom with a hundred round mag.

speachless......

Ummm. Totaly cg.

As much as I want to believe this is real, it&#39;s not actually that covert, little tommy down the street could knock this out of the sky with his bb gun.
