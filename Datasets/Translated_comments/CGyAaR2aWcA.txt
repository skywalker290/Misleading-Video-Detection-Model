Arjun kapoor and Alia Bhatt look great together. Alia Bhatt has evolved as an actor after her impressive performance in Highway whereas Arjun Kapoor has given a creditable performance in Gunday.

Dayuuumm Alia and Arjun are sooo cute XDi love their pairs &lt;3

I actually thought this movie will be based in the olden times and there was war e.t.cI thought I would see Alia in like a South Indian character with sari&#39;s which would not suite her.But after watching the trailer I was so glad.The movie looks nice.

It&#39;s seem to be a great movie..!!Alia Bhatt is looking quite pretty 😉

The novel had those very simple normal characters, the trailer looks all dashy and glamorous which is why it won&#39;t do justice to the book.

Epic ❤️
