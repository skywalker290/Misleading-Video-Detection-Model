Jay baba harbajan singh ji 🇮🇳️
Heart touching!!! My brothers in Uniform need not always be as kadak as their Vardi, they&#39;ve  heart as soft as a flower. I have been wanting to show my gratitude  towards my brothers in Uniform who are spending their lives protecting me without knowing me who I&#39;m. Just to show my respect to them we have been sending Rakhis to my brothers in Uniform. I started realizing how that kacha dhaga boosts their feelings when I got messages from them specially  posted at LOC. One of my friend who visited this place told me about Baba Mandir, now I watched how caring He is. May He always Bless us

Jai hind
Is it true story that lady saw him train?  Or just video?

Looking great in turban 

Baba harbhjan singh🇮🇳🇮🇳
Nice work bhuvan...real meaning of content creator 

This is true

Literally goosebumps speechless bhuvan&#39;s work is just incredible no words for him

Have you ever seen any bihari or himachali or malayali protect the border after death? The answer is NO. Harbhajan is used to fool Sikhs. He is used to make the Sikhs scapegoats. China fucked Indian military so tightly. Everyone was afraid to go to the Indo China border. India made this story to encourage sikhs to go to Indo China border. India lost his territory aksichin. Harbhajan singh could not expel Chinese from that area

I salute our legend harbhajan singh

Jai Hind Jai Sena...
I&#39;m from Pakistan who loved India as a kid. I always wished the countries to reunite as united India that would&#39;ve been great. I grew up in a village where our ancestors were Indians even after partition but they had to come to Pakistan around 1970&#39;s so we grew up adapting a mixture of Pakistani and Indian culture (I&#39;m christian tho) I always wished that my family never came to Pakistan because there is a lot of discrimination for christians this is the reason I left Pakistan. My paternal grandpa was an army officer and he was even captured by India in a war (I don&#39;t remember which war) and I remember how hard life is for a solider if India becomes United India I would be the happiest girl in the world Jai Hind India 🇮🇳 love from a Pakistani

Jai Hind

Please full movie YouTube pr dal do

His atma doing the duty at great heights and cold border India and china. He has so much love towards the country great patriot, salutes to Harbhajan singh.

Watch the reel, those who come here will like it.
This is a new role ,,, Singh baba sleeps in the train,, alerts the Indian Army,,, then China killed Q 20, did Singh baba sleep that night?

Watch this masterpiece after ignoring 1000 times for last 4 years

Punjabi hai....Punjabi accent missing laga ....bas dialogue bol Dene se nahi hoga ... offcourse BB is new Bee in town ...need to go long way

Great!epic !!
salute hai bro aapko
It was such a great video but i watch this after 4 years 

Those who demand history and say that this is Punjab and not India. I request them to watch this video. And I want to say one thing, I am sorry but I don't remember the name of your Guru, he has defined the four Varnas which originated from Hinduism and by uniting all the four Varnas, we are called Sikhs. Sikh and Hindu both follow the same teachings. That Guru's Kalsa was that Guru's fate. Jai shree ram 
Dear parents: Just becoz your child is smiling at their phones, doesn&#39;t mean they have boyfriend or girlfriend , they are watching this Masterpiece !️

Nice story as well heart touching

4Saal hoga niklke?
I regret for not watching this before
