I’m the first to comment in Monday 4 March 2024

What is called the system that used a similar principle for increasing grip in motorcycles?

I’m the first to comment in 2024

And how much will CO2 chargers cost?
Who is watching this in 2024!!!

8 years later, I’m using 14 Pro Max and the only thing that needs parachute is the prices…

How it started - iPhone 7 with parachute systemHow it ended - iPhone 7 without headphone jack

Co2 cost $200

Who is waching in dec 2023.. 😂 making fool

Space x program using those tech now

The new iPhone with parachute technology. Coming Fall 2125.

Iphone 7 original release- we removed headphone jack

I can confirm that this is not the real iphone6😡😡😡

With headphone jack 🤑
We gotta say that we were all thinking a parachute was about to come out of that damn phone lol

That is something they should actually add

I think Samsung and Apple should add this? (I think it will be hard) oh and btw thr hole for the gas will take all water resisiltance out

the charging port: am i an joke to you?

Lets hope its gonna be at iPhone 15

Same as airbag

I watched it in 2016, 7 years ago. Now i am here again.

me: <b>*drops iphone 7*</b>iphone 7: <b><i>*releases CO2 to slow fall</i></b>*

This is some kind of meizu
😅

I remember watching this in schooldays being blown away 😅😂

This is crazy! You are a concept maniac!:)

When I wanted a parashute system and got no 3.5 connector 😂😂😂😂
<b>CO2 TANK SOLD SEPERATELY</b><b>PARACHUTE SYSTEM SUBSCRIPTION SOLD SEPERATELY</b>

I remember watching this as a kid and thinking this was the future.

Ok

watching this iPhone 7 ad 7 years later... noice

iphone 3310 <b>only durable for drops</b>

Fake😂

Space x phone

<a href="">0:07</a> what drop test?

Someone could modify an iphone like that now

This tech might even rival space x self landing 😂

Wow, I was so excited for this phone.
Holding a 14 pro surprised to see that this technology is still not available 😂😂😂

i cant wait for the  iphone 7 to release

Wow wow 7plus 😂

Literal, i learn much more than physics class

Gooooooood❤❤❤

Apple iphone 7😂Not even in 14
i love the part with the actual parachute

I’m a YouTube or I create a lot of animation videos and funny videos

i bet they never thought apple removed the headphone jack on the 7

I’m happy
Show this to William Osman tell him to make it lmao

Haters will say &#39;Just buy a case lol&#39;

apple: remove the charger says...
NO WAY!!! 11!1

This is FAKE

i hate this concept so much but at the same time i kinda like it, but what bothers me most is what if ur ona a rollercoaster?

@jeslenz
trash ahh phone😢😢🐟🐟🐟🐟🚗🚗
Cap 🧢
No I searched this up 💀

2022 no jet yet 😅
who ever thought that was real is stupid

I bet if the 7 actually had this feature android users would still be like “we had that for years”

who watch in 2077?

Would&#39;nt it be better if it just hovered until you grabbed it?

We now have a crash detection 😂

Wtf the lies tho

I’m still waitin’ to this phone’s release

AAAAA

IPHONE 14 SEPTEMBER 2022

Your concepts are still better than the iPhone 14 that was presented yesterday
Your imagination is beyond iPhone

I remember believing this

Wow hahaha

I can’t wait to try this out

accidentistical drop saver

Plz bgm name
Imagine if the iphone 7 actually turned out like that

We all believed these

STILL NO SPACE FOR A HEDPHONE JACK

that CO2 thing is Co2 charge

CO2

I did..
Chuppu h tu

This didn’t age well

oh no
Help 💀, Today my teacher said that this phone exists

song name ?

I come from the future, I threw my cell phone off the bed and it crashed
It's already out???
2022/23

This design is possible but if you forget to put gas in you might accidently break your phone

Yay it has a headphone jack!

I come from almost 7 years in the future, the iPhone does not come with that system
This aged well

this real

imagine it falling on your face

imagine getting hyped for this

The apple phones now are dogshit

It was like this once
guys i dont think this is real

<b>iPhone 14 coming soon</b>

We have the iPhone 13, and we don’t even have a parachuting system

Who else got this in their recommended after 6 years

Dude is that a parachute on your phone

when i was a kid i really thought this was real

😀🤣🤣🤣😅😅HILARIOUS in 2022
when i was a kid, i watched this and thought that an iphone 7 actually has these features..EVEN IF IT WAS ALREADY RELEASED

6 years here..

what nonsense
You: go to Apple and ask for another can of CO2 Apple: that will be $436 please

Anyone on 2021

Apple; iPhone 14 next year, let’s add a anti theft explosive device on it!

It’s all fun and games until the battery runs out while it’s in the air

Apple remove headphone jack then Samsung followed Samsung sucks
Apple has been doing other useless things such as removing the headphone jack

XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Very bad not reale in 7or all

this wasnt even made on april fools...

him: pushes iphone off the tableiphone: so you have chosen death

Headphonejack xD
“Sorry, do you have any spare CO2 for my iPhone 7?”

Wow I didn’t know my iPhone 7 could do that.

recommend after 5years

the Ironman of phones!

I had an IF 7, but I didn’t. I’m from 2021. Where is the parachute and why did you see it now??
people who disliked this tried to drop their phone to see if this was real and put gas in their headphone jack.

henlo i have iphonre 7 i fdrop but no parashoote system y not lier

Iphone 7 spaceX edition starting at 9999$

Futuristic iphone be like :v

5

THIS GUY COMES UP WITH THE BEST  IDEAS EVER

Nokia more durable and less expensive

Man, u live in 3021.
this is the coolest concept

suitable for mars

This is actually really smart but I think the phone should be more precise than the falcon 9

R.i.p to the weird design

IPHONE 7 ??? huh NOW THERE IS IPHONE 13 and that is in your imagination

Fake ..

This is a joke

This got me shitting myself. I’ll be right out I’m charging my phone’s carbon dioxide tank

wish that existed.

This guy: (recharges CO2 tank)Also this guy: (immediately wastes the CO2 he just put in)

So, they predicted Mars 2020...

- battery live

Bruh
What happens if it’s going to FaceTime religious activate and go  cracked

this is wrong

I thought there was an actual parachute...LOL

This is good 👍🏻

Imagine the screen facing the floor

Concept : masterpiece for him/herOriginal : better

6

I will see it in 2100

<b>iPhone PH</b>8 000$

Nice conceptI want it in iPhone 15

You wish buddy. We on Iphone 13 and we&#39;re not close to that unfortunately. Hope that existed.

I love how the gas comes out of the headphone jack

Dont imagine ur iphone to be a rocket

It's amazing that it looks so good lol
I’m using an iPhone 7 and no parachute system.

i remember watching this back then and believing it

it looks like an android

Who else wishes this was real

Another 1000 IQ invention

Dang, they really just said <b>Screw you charging!</b>

XD?

Bruh they don&#39;t want to loose half their sales

Sometimes... Expectations are diffrent than reality.-Some random person on the internet

Parachute : +299$Parachute Pro : +469$
Lol 😂

The CO2 charger could run out

Imagine co2 release inside your pocket

Case:Am i joke to you?

Back then people were thinking outside the box

wheres the parachute system on my iphone 12?

MY IPHONE HE STOLE IT AHHHHH

iPhone 13 ready and still no parachute system :(

iPhone 13 and still don’t got any of this

Why Apple didn’t make it :(

Can I use this?

It’s a cool idea but what if you run out of co2 gas when you are on a road trip and you forgot the co2 gas and you drop it?

We have airplane mode.

This video has 22k unlikes. What&#39;s wrong with you guys?!

Now i would carry a c02 tank anywhere i go!

Never knew spacex made phones...

Some TikTok kid got 8 million likes off this vid. 🤦🏾‍♂️
whell  i have iphone 7 and it doesnt exist

Everyone gangsta until it falls on the screen side

Well damn
Watched this when i was 6 lmao

Wow ımpossble
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

God this is so stupid hahaha
i remember this video i saw it when i has 6 years

No

it&#39;s  a very ok we have bomper kase

I’m so clumsy with my phones apple needs to make that a thing

Back when I was a kid I thought it was real

So why don&#39;t they have these on airplanes?

as the saying goes,<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

Lol i actully searched for this because i watcehd this video when it came out, then there were comments loke woow or i tought this is real fu. Now there are jusr memes :(

XD

im in 2021 with an iphone 12 pro and still have no parachute system

its all fun and games until it drops when there is no co2

Phone: AAAA Oh

How would you charge the phone?

i know this video is fake if this was real that will be amazing! Why they are not doin’ that?!

Oh God, 10 y/o me really believed it 5 years ago...

Maybe you should do a video on iPhone 13 cause from your point of view it may be having a car mode 🤣

Bruh i have a iPhone 7 black but mine doesn’t do that

NAMIK KEMAL

First Apple have to graduate to the memory card slot then go for space age landing phone.

People on YouTube : <b>make awesome iphone consepts</b>Apple : 💩💩💩 we can make this only

bruh what would happen if it fell face down and i boosted it like what would you expect a force that would be able to carry the entire phone do with the gravity&#39;s help   ( ik this is all fake and wouldn&#39;t have happened coz i am in 2021 and that feature is still not integrated  )

This guy must have been hired by some company for actual visual effects.

I stayed 🤡
I came here because of tiktok

bro but if it fall facedown it just speed it up lmao 😜

Why can't the Co2 tank be filled by blowing?
Funny how it looks and probably works like any other iphone

:)

So this was the technology that made my phone land on it&#39;s back all the time- good to know :3

I come from tik tok XD
Vg

Actually, the cocept is <b>FANTASTIC</b>

We don&#39;t need that we have airplane Just remember to  turn it on

I hate appleThat feature didn’t work with my iPhone 7Now my phone is broken and when I took it to Apple, they said that the feature doesn’t exist. Apple is a liar and a fraud. &gt;:(

When you accidentally put on a case and drop it

Anyone in 2021

First of all iPhone 12 pro max don&#39;t have parachute then iPhone 7

Came in your recommend ??

Wait why would apple do that because then they will get less people coming in for repairs. Think smarter not harder

those co2 refills are gonna cost a fortune at minimum

😂

Wow. Now apple has made it space friendly. Attached RCs

Him: iPhone Parachute ConceptMe: Realizes I had Airplane And Dropped it And ThenIt flee

When you watch it on Real iPhone 7*

<a href="">

Bro whose watchin it in 2021 we have iphone12now

Wtf is wrong with apple bruh!!

Apple should be paying this guy tbh

Guess there time machine about the future broke ..... pathetic ...why bother making this 😲

They had us in the first half, I&#39;m not gonna lie

Me watching this in 2021 to see how cringe this is

Who else got this recommended 5 years later?

We hope that we can see it in iPhone 999999999999999999999999 model 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Such system could actually be useful

Damn why did i click this after 5 years

To be totally fair, a modern smart phone could totally control independent thrust vectoring nozzles. Just maybe not in a modern smartphone sized shell though.

What if it falls the other way? Xd
Me

Meanwhile the 12 not having a parachute system lol

We have Space ship mode too

I was lowkey so confused for a good minute

That moment when your phone falls screen facing down 😂

2021?

Youtube after 5 years: ay check this out

drops phone it becomes fucking iron man

The f****😂😂

Anyone else accidentally click the wrong video while reading the comments

Lol

Samsung will be  bankrupt if this was real

I hate apple for not making this

What the actual heck?!

Hmm.... No

Watching this in 2021.... and using iphone 12 be like🥱🥱

Iphone 12 rocket system

Honestly me dumbass se this in 2015 and thought it was real

Watching on my broken iphone 7

<b>Not at all</b> :) my shite <b>bRoKen</b>

lmao

De impo sible.i got this in 2020.

The frik-

Thodi pain da fudda.....sale hoye co2 tank de
Yea why doesn’t it just fly back into your hand

Bold of you to have assumed apple would be innovative

Me

This has aged quite well

Mr
People back in the day thinking this will be true but now a days apple removed the charger from the phone case😂😂😂

AQ the latest system is not even on phones, by the way, greetings to Instagram
That explains why they removed the headphone jack.
<a href=""> it good as a first animation 😅?

This shit got recommended to me in 2020Can’t understand YouTubes algorithm

Bro I always watched this as a kid

POV: You are here but u have this in your recommendations

Me watching this on an IPhone 7

Missing those old days do u ??

U guys have phone ???!!!!😮
Nope they want your phone broken 4 better profit in repairs

ono

apple even wants you to pay $500 for back glass replacement and yall think of this back then?

&quot;Add CO2 gas&quot;,,, fine👍,,,, Now how much should we pay for iCO2??

Five years later and all they did was remove the home button and add some camera&#39;s

Whatttaffff?

Greatest meme of all time

😂😂😂

While holding iPhone 7 watching this video. Himmmmmm

From 2020

Refill cost 1000$

People complaining that the iPhone 7 doesn’t actually have this but if it did the phone would be like $3000

Is this for real

Ah yes rub the fact that I have had my phone for 5 years and counting in my face even more

<b>B R A V E</b>

So we are all here right now?

2015 : iPhone 7 Paracute SystemMe in 2020 : Like that ever gonna happen.

Me watching this on an iPhone XR in 2020

Apple, take notes.

I remember this

Bullshit🤬
Wow I can’t wait 😂

What if your charging port gets too hot? Will the phone explode😳Nvm CO2 is not flammable according to google

Can we say he works with apple

It’s all fun and games until u have to refill and pay $500 each time your phone falls

I can tell you that this is an lie.

Now days no innovations from apple

I phone 15 venom system
What if it falls on the screen?

Even If apple Got this technology if the back is Glass it&#39;s gonna shatter and also ruin the cameras.If it&#39;s metal and have metal coated camera covers it will be possible.

As a kid when I watched this, I always thought that apple was definitely going to do this someday but now that I think about it, why would they want to develop something that would protect your phone? If they increase the longevity of their phones, they won&#39;t be able to sell new ones. And this thought makes me feel betrayed

I am watching this on my iPhone 7.

Bruh
Apple: meet our newest innovation, the new ‘iPhone 7 Plus 2 Self Land Phone’

My 7 Plus laughed

Even in 2020 this still looked ridiculous

if they added this they would lose alot of money ( people wont come to replace there broken phone )

After 5 years even in iphone 12 they didn&#39;t add this feature

What if doesnot land on its back

Ohh fck why i had not taken this iPhone

Apple in 2020: &quot;In order to reduce CO2 emissions, we have decided to take a very bold step this year. We have decided not to provide the CO2 in the can. This will ensure that CO2 emissions are reduced by 1276% compared to previous year. We would say we are brave to take such a decision&quot;

Anyone after iPhone 12 launch?

The real deal is when the phone lands upside down and no parachute can save your freaking iPhone

Imagine dropping this while lying down with your face up,my eyes.

so is everyone in 2020 now here? or y’all seeing this in 2021

I hope for boomerang system so when it fall  it will come back to my hand

System like that would be implemented in iPhones last, after everyone else would&#39;ve done so already

Ok I don&#39;t know whether if its weird or not but I got this video in my recommendation after 5 years of it&#39;s releasing date😂😂

what

Me but why??😂😂

Guys every phone has this today. Set your phone in airplane mode, then drop it from any height. Way more simple than parachute mode.

If they really implemented that on iPhone they would use wireless CO2 refill system 😅😅😅😂😂

I wanna know what people thought when this came out

Remeber writing this in my school article 5 years ago

12 launched
What if it fell face first? It would fall faster

Bro its fake

Not me

Youtube lowkey selling Android devices like...

&quot;It&#39;s okay. We have airplane mode.&quot;

what the fuck
I legit believe this 5 years ago

Do you think about this is that it’s actually possible bars Apple so we won’t be seeing until 2080if were lucky

Let alone addition they even subtract wall charger😕

I phone become obsolete.......

lul
This actually would be a dope iphone to have tbh

Why is this in my recommendations after 5 years???

When are people going to get over the fact that an old video got recommended to them and a some other people? Like why does that fact continue to fascinate and amaze people and they KEEP JOKING ABOUT IT in EVERY COMMENT SECTION, EVERY TIME.

Wtf man i just drop my phone to check it now i am commenting from another mob

You want a dislike? Heres how you gonna get dislike

Am i the only one looking for comments of 5years ago? 😂😂

IPhone with RCS xd

Like this phone is not even in 2020😂

I’m currently watching this with my iphone 7 though 😂

Who else got this recommended after 12 years?

The iPhone 12 also came out, but we haven&#39;t seen anything like it yet.

Nice I want one

Imagine this being introduced and then iphones battery will drop even faster

I had a 7 plus and I didn’t know this existed.. but doesn’t work on my current iPhone 11 Pro Max, and now I have the back glass broken

Yes Apple is trying to make space for the parachute by removing THINGS every year. Bring me a nokia 3310

If Apple could do this (I know its fake), then there is obviously space for a headphone jack.

Why r people disliking this, guess they can&#39;t tale the joke.Such an amazing video.

I tried this on my iPhone 7 and it work! The gravity work! And now my phone screen is cracked WHAT AN AMAZING DAY!

Who else watching on their ip7 🙋🏻‍♂️

Maybe:Other companies do it in next 5-6 year.Aplle in 3021: We have stolen something never seen before.

At least this one has a headphone jack

<b>what if the phone falls on the other side, it would fall faster right</b>*THINK*🙄

Me adds Helium.😁
People in 2021 watching this video with iphone 7 be like

Ok. That&#39;s some dope ass editing and animation. Wow

Who else go this in their recommendations?

Oh no. Mine fell face-first and broke it&#39;s screen.

Title: Parachute systemMe: * laughing in airplane mode *

You wish

Niceeuuuu 😂😂
Its 2020.. They took away the phone changer and you are talking about parachute

Got recommended after 5 yrs ,but still no parachute in phone😂

GAY

*CO2 level low *User goes to buy a CO2 refill Employee :- sir that will cost 900$ User :- I intake more CO2 with one breath 😭 for free

I phone can&#39;t give 1 fkn charger and earphone but all fkn feature experiments and fkn shit and fkn etc etc

2015: Apple Parachute System2020: No 3.5mm audio jack, no charger, no earpods2021: no cables2022: no phone. Buy it separately. 2023: no box either. You pay money for the CO2 for the proposed parachute system. Which is already all around you. Now jump from a tall building and see how well the valves and vents in your body work.

Go over there
This was 5 years ago... and till now I didn’t know it.

Apple in 1993Cheap but can do a lot of workThat’s SimpleApple in 2020:It’s Only 999$ and we won’t give you a charger or an earbuds.

Killed it

what even is the youtube algorithm

My life was a lie 😭

Lol

no no no this is actually genius

Why is this on my recommendations?

When u realise this was android

6 year old me thought it was real

Okay, weird.

So that was a lie

And parachute costs upto 10000$😆😆😆

Apple says that, this is the phone we ever made.

WTF. Apple 🍎 who took away the headphone jack, will add a CO² container inside it

Who else got recommended after 5 years.

If apple did this they are going to charge more than your car

Mr

I&#39;m from the future and the iPhones have the same design, they are just more expensive and doesn&#39;t have charger

YouTube algorithm is sus

This will be available after 5to 7 more years

It&#39;s way to square to be an iphone

CO2 tankWhere can i plug my airpod?

Lol

Lol.. Yr recommendee me this after 5 years..

youtube algorithm:

There&#39;s actually a phone case that does this now.Not like, exactly same as in the video but some sort of plastic pops out when the phone falls

Totaly fake chat yes if u do to

Thank u. I need this.

I can confirm this is true.

Youtube reccomend you to watch this

Xd

Good Animation 🤣
Who is loocking this video with an iPhone 7 5 years Later and is like :  :/

This is better than the actual apple commercial 🤣

Me and my shitty iphone 7 even messenger dosen’t work good🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh I have a iPhone 7 and ain’t do dis

I remember seeing this and thinking it was the real deal, smh

Lmao why are there so many dislikes. Do people take this seriously or something?

Who else got this in there recommendations 5 years later?

I bet 4,000 bucks that someone in this world thought that this was a leak of the return if the headphone jack

I remember thinking this was real

How didnt i not see this in 5 years and see it now wtf

If It Lands Face First You’re Gonna Be Fucked

And it will cost as much as iPhone 2077
Fuck your lies, greetings from twenty in 2020 😂
The cost of that CO2 tank equals 1 iPhone unit.<b>Good luck</b>

YouTube in 2015: don’t worry, you’ll be included in the recommendations in 5 minutes. YouTube in 2020: oh, I was wrong, in 5 years.
This concept is pretty shitty. Even if there is a CO2 tank in the phone, why doesn&#39;t it inflate an airbag lol.

Little did they know, all apple would do is remove the headphone jack

Why is this recommended to me anyway:D

The fact that it’s an iPhone 6 is just great

Directed by Robert B. Weide

Just so you know Apple removed a headphone jack, touch id and charger from the box let alone a whole co2 tank

XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

It is not in i phone 12

Jokes?

I remember the first time I saw this video🤣🤣

Ithenth miruuu
Holy shit apple forget to put co2 cylinder in my iphone7

dec.27.2020 lols

After 5 years YouTube recommend me this😂😂

We&#39;re about to be in 2021 and apple still didn&#39;t put parachute systemInstead of it they took the fingerprint system, headphone jack, charger

watching it right now makes me laugh so hard

After watching this after 5 years who all thought never believe this kind of videos

They are not going to do this if phone&#39;s doesn&#39;t break how will they make money

This actually can be a real thing but reason why it is not well co2 tank would be really really small and with pressure high like that it would only last like 0.01 seconds which wont save your phone fron smashingTo be able to save it from smashing on floor, considering average weight of smartphone (100 - 200 grams) and high pressure, tank should be bigger than your head, if my calculations are right which probably are not

😂😂

<b>Space X has entered the chat</b>

This came Outta nowhere!

Lol it doesnt have a head phone jack let alone a automatic co2 powered thrusters lol waste of money

Should try this now

This so cool😎

back here again after 5 years

Shit!

Who is seeing this video after iphone 12 launch?

Imagine if you dropped your phone and you pick it up and drop it again

Dislikes are from the backcover users

When your phone has parachute but can’t even use earphones

Recomended on december 27 2020 who else👇

Haha what thw fuck is this dude haha🤣🤣

What the fuck

Damn i remember this

Watching this after 5 years😂😂

I hate it... So much CO2
That would&#39;ve been a cool feature too bad they don&#39;t put it on their phones because it makes them less money since you won&#39;t break your phone so fast.You put the tank in front of the charging port

Xd

Merry Christmas if your watching this after 5 years

I’m watching once again after 5 years 😂😂

Kinda late but would have preferred a headphone jack back in the days instead of this

How many of you get it recommend

Apple could probably do this now

Am i the only who got recommend this after 5yrs

Not possible

@RE4PER Like anyone cares

Is this a Meme, recommended after 5 years 🤭

ok

2021?

Fake

Has it really been 5 years

why does this video get recommended after the new iPhone 12 came out

Meanwhile 2020:Apple: WOWW!! We have magnets on the back

Ohh shii- I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS AS A KID

Apple: CO2 gas price is only $1199

I don&#39;t thinks so that this is real 😅😅

Network your
Skydiphone

The phone perfectly meant for tony stark. 😔

Yeah yeah i see the iphone 12 too

Me

But what if you jumped?The iPhone will sense that it is falling Then it would activate in your pocketThen it would send you to mars

Add CO2 gas, only $800 from Apple. Also, those nozzles won’t do shit because I’ll be slapping on a case on that already pricy bitch.

2 mins silence for the people who thought this was real ...

Bruh I still remember when this rumour was going around😂

Treelon 🌲 Musk is typing..

Who is watching after after I phone 12 pro max has launched 😂

Knowing me my dumb butt would try to put my phone charger through the holes

Who else got recommend after 5 years

iPhone using subscribers of this channel left the chat

me realizing apple would never do that because they’re Addicted to money

No one:Youtube’s algorithm in 2020:

NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT LEVEL CGI, OMG....

Epic 🤣😂🤣😂
Plot Twist: The iPhone is really in millions of little pieces

Iphone 7<b>While the iPhone is a iphone 6</b>

accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and saviour sex before marriage and porn is a sin you will go to hell if you dont repent and turn away from your wicked ways GOD bless stay safe either way I hope you have a amazing Day.

“It’s not rocket science” 🤓

YouTube in 2015: No2016: No2017: No2018: No2019: No2020: Hello there😏

Lol they even took away the headphone jack and charger too

After 3 years finaly i made it in real life and it works!

From aeroplane My phone -- SafeMe --

This didn&#39;t age well

nobody:youtube: let me recommend this after 5 years

So it took YouTube 5 years to realize this guy uploaded this video : |

NEXT UP: iPhone 13 without phone!

Lol why I got recommended today wtf

And now we don&#39;t even get chargers 🙂
Why is everyone getting recommended this specific video 5 years later

When you jave q phone so weak you gotta make a parachute for it lmao

See you in 5 yeras

Who else git it recommended 5 years later

Screen guard in Elon style
1% of chat: who got this recommendation after 5 years? 99% of the chat: I&#39;ve never gotten this many likes before

This is not possible even in Cyberpunk 2077

so I found this on my recommended

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 in 2020 they even removed the charger
😂😂😂

It&#39;s an alien  starship

Inspiration from nokia3310.

Not included in the front, they still need the 400 dollar screen repairs. How else could they make any money?

Bruh my friends thought this was an actual thing smh

If it this trueThen why it&#39;s animated?

Who else watched this video in 2015Me

XDDD

FAKE

Lmao who got fooled 5 years ago?

This is a good april fools prank actually.

😂

All I see is headphone jack (•‿•)

How about real footage?

Airplane mode: Am i a joke to you

Gas to be filled is Apple&#39;s iCO2. Normal CO2 won&#39;t work.😂

LEMAO

Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Why i can&#39;t add ahahah reaction like facebook? 🤣🤭
I know this is completely irrelevant but, I&#39;ve just eaten the best orange ever

How many here after 5 years

<b>One day iphone will definitely land on the moon.</b>

Mere to 6 saal ho jane the galti sae haath lag gaya

Let&#39;s be honest no one is searched for this video!

This little manuer is going to cost you $1000

Musk rocket not achieved it but apple doing this 🤣

Smh my head

Scam 2015

Apple Engineers: &quot;Hey Android manufacturers! Write That Down, Write That Down. After Android phones launch and perfect this feature, we will then launch it 5 years later as an Apple innovation.&quot;

Man this never gets old 🤣🤣🤣

I got it in my after 5 year

Really

Apple: parachute mode in our mobMe: I have airplane mode in my mobile

😂😂😂

Friends, hello everyone) Rate the video, I will be very grateful)) <a href="">
Me

In an era where iphone removes all the ports in there iphone, would it be possible to have these?😂😂

This didn’t age well did it?

That&#39;s not parachute. I want to see balloon not fart.

Lol so not true

how to turn your iPhone into a mars rover

Be ole ole olaaaaaay 😂
Why are all the comments so recent

Yes indeed my iPhone 7 has this kind of system

Wtf! Is it real.

&quot;Why use parachute when u have airplane mode&quot;

Now 12 ok bye

Apple will do it ,If they do, who will visit their service centers .

What if tho

I remember watching this in elementary school 💀

It is mobile not aeroplane 😂😂😂

Me I was like what about the iPhone 12

Not profitable. The more phones that don't break, the more new ones the company won't sell.
Like could you imagine? This is 2077 cyber punk crap dood

I phone&#39;s iron man version
I am searching for a comment from 5 years ago.

Can I use this system to make the phone fly to me from my table ?..

My phone won’t even update past iOS 11

From where that headphone jack comes??

NASA wants to know the location

hmmm.... I see. <b>types in  iphone 12</b>

Me

I remember watching this 5 years ago

it&#39;s still not in my budget

This could have saved soooo many people lots of money but Apple won&#39;t even try to bring it so that people could go to them and fix the phones

Damn
turn upside down
I watched this video the day it released, Now i got this recommend again after 5 years, This made me remember old memories. Those days i phone is a dream to me, now i have i phone 12 pro max                                                                                            Keep fighting for your dreams one day you will achieve it

Hum to chutiya he

Apple’s new leaks are expecting to have a phone with no port and people thought 5 years ago that this was realistic lmao

<i>Apple: $700 to recharge CO2 tank</i>

Its already iPhone 12 and still no gas

Kids and old people&#39;s please don&#39;t do this at home!!

It&#39;s better to have propeller that fly like drone..

Yo I got mine in reverse when I drop it it launches into the ground and breaks:(

Well you should have told me  it&#39;s fake earlier . I threw my friend&#39;s iPhone from the terrace.

This is genius.

Hello people from the recommendations

yeah, good luck finding a charging port on the iphone 13-

ifone break

Is there a wireless CO2 recharger

The gas refill will be £1299 thank you :)

Is this a joke? And why are we here anyway? Lmao.

Plot twist: it’s 2020 and iPhones are shittier than all previous models

Yes, but i let you introduce us the sound of this shit xD

Guys, what the fuck
oh, nice
A cover???
Watching this on my iPhone 12 Pro Max...

Thats the most fake thing I ever saw in my life

Just make sure airplane mode is on, otherwise it won&#39;t work

I watched this on my iPhone 7

Why is this recommended....wtf

Apple in 2021: &quot;We removed the Charging port so you don&#39;t need to charge your phone all the time&quot;Apple in 2022: &quot;We ReMoVeD ThE PoWEr ButToN BeCauSE We&#39;RE LaZY!!Apple in 2023: &quot;Fuck off&quot;

Didn&#39;t realize that the iphone 7 came out 5 years ago wow

Even if they could the most probably wouldn’t as fragile phones make them more money

nah... we need headphone jack
Christmas for anyone?

Iphone 7 was just 5 years?

What memories xd
YouTube Recommended after 5 years?? Seriously??

After seeing this in 2020 Me: 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂

This seems like something you&#39;d see on 4chan

If this was possible, who else would try this instead of bunjee jumping?

Apple be like in 2021: i like this idea that is great lets remove the charging port

Dang I got a iPhone 7 but it doesn’t have a parachute 😔

HOLD UP WAS THERE EVEN A IPHONE 7 5 YEARS EARLIER

Considering the growth of apple, by 2050 it will create iPhone 30 with 15 cameras!

They were defiantly overthinking this one, just add a gyro scope and a reputable pillow and ur doneeee.

Nasa: “DO NOT MOVE!”

After 5 years .. youtube is high on weed.

What happens if it falls on the screen and not on the back ?

All fun and games until ios 25 forgets to update the Co2 bug fixes and you drop your phone and it explodes from the Co2

Hymmm, it&#39;s maybe even possible to make something like that

Saw it 5 years ago

Honestly tho, how cool would this be?

Follow my Instagram if you are watching on an iPhone 7(@yohannes208)

Everyone one doesn’t know that Apple doesn’t want headphone jack or the charger bc it makes the factory too hard and also the camera could get better, Apple thinks what he’s gonna do, U all Samsung users need to think then speak!

If only apple actualy did somthing innovate.

And finally CO2 tank price is more than iphone 12

Lol

what

This tec is Insan

Apparently they don&#39;t even have the space to put a headphone jack...

Why do you think

Co2 tank, LMAO WHAT A JOKE, THEY CAN&#39;T EVEN PUT IN A HEADPHONE JACK AND A CHARGING BRICK LET ALONE A CO2 TANK
It not apple it space X

Future phone hover board 🤤
The hell I wish this was true

Me after watching this: dropping  my iPhone 7Iphone:🤕

2015 : iPhone with parachute 2017 : iPhone without headphones 2018 : iPhone without 3.5mm jack2019 : iPhone without charger2020 : iPhone without battery 2025 : iPhone with every single screw in a separate boxThere is something with 2016If anybody recalls it pls tell me

Watching this video on iphone12 main speciality is this phone not comes with charger** btw today 25th December so Merry Christmas to everyone

wonder how many fellas this fooled

Me lok
Hi people 5 years later

Fake

😥😥I dropped my father&#39;s iPhone 7 from 2nd floor my home now I am living on ground floor pls help 😣Thanks for 0 likes 😉😉

Recommended after 5 years

The iPhone runs out of charge in a day, if it had that system it would run out in 15 minutes 😂

So hyped for this phone because I have a old iphone 12 pro max

Who else got this recommended after 5 years ?

Lol

THIs sO faKe a FeAl FoNe WoOd dIe Xd Lmao

That&#39;s just a repulsor system, not some parachute. And, why did this get recommended to me after 5 years, anyway?

Is it real

Still I have the iPhone 7 plus and I have never seen this thing once it fell from the terrace and It cracked. It costed me 100 dollars to repair it. Nothing like this happened now I am using the iPhone 12 mini but still I use 7 plus as my secondary phone

bro that co2 tank wouldnt last half a drop if would finish instantly

And I’m watching it with my 7 plus. Fuck you

Who else watched this when u didn&#39;t had unlimited internet.<a href="">#Bluetoothdays</a>

Hahahahahahaha what a real shit
Apple is too lame to do such thing it&#39;s sad

Merry Christmas Everyone🤶
Thinking apple will add more things to the phone, ITS A PRANKK!!

I have the iPhone 7 and it sucks

YouTube be like:<b>Ok so let&#39;s recommend this after 5 years.</b>

Wow great imagination

What am I supposed to do with this in 2020?

5 years ago : iPhone 7 with parachute charger...How it end : iPhone 12 without charger.

Want to see the comments of people 5 years ago... But can&#39;t find any😂😂

Elon Musk can make this possible.

This video is so fakeThe iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphones Jack <a href="">0:25</a>

We unite once again

You do know Apple wants you to break your phone so they earn more money. Were we that stupid?

Apple, Challenge Everything 💸

What if it drops on display side? 😂

LOL

What if he uses this parachute mode after turning on the airplane mode

It has parachute mode and airplane mode also.

Who thought a parachute will deploy.

I didn&#39;t search for this

A headphone jack? Impossible!
Fake

It got me in the first half ngl ...

Wait Apple wanted to do this! Who&#39;s going to replace with a new iPhone-20,20XL,XXL,XXXL  the following year? Of course with the significant upgrade, 20x price tag change. 😂

Biggest scam ever 😂

Whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaatttttt!!!

Who else got this in their recommended after 5 years

What if the phone falls vertically?

This system: thought of: in 2015Built: never Not till 2020 at least

Nokia: Connecting people YouTube: We like that that&#39;s our algorithm😎

Anybody else got this on their recommendations??

Man phones are evolving to a level that is scientifically not possible

Why does this feel like it was part of an elaborate plan by 4chan to troll iphone users?

Wtf if phone drops from front??

It might work! And here&#39;s how:According to our recent experience, apple is slowly removing charger and that all, so after some time there will be no battery, hence more extra space for those CO2 gAs CYlInDeR!

Those days.... When they put literally everything thing in a single device...... And now they they even removed charger😟

2020: tell me why this is more amazing than me???

🙄

Getting such accuracy and precision is not possible

If apple did this, instead of pushing the phone upwards, it would push the phone downwards so it&#39;ll break more and you&#39;ll have to pay even more to fix it

That’s how a spaceX phone would be..

Spoiler:-I just tried it, and it didn’t work.Booooooooo

Isn’t that a iPhone 6😂

Well,this didn&#39;t age well

Lol

thats 2077 technology mate

We had so much expectations from Apple back then

Fun fact: You got this recommended

This is insane

Here for the roasting comments 🍿🥤

Imagin if the phone fell on the screen side and the paraahut system kicked in

I got at recommended after 5 years

Why are people acting so shocked that this is in their recommended?It isn&#39;t that crazy...People have been and will continue to get recommended this video.You&#39;re roughly just as likely to have gotten recommended this video 3 years ago, though you probably didn&#39;t because of your viewed history.I guarantee you that if you were not signed into an account and had your history turned off, you would most likely not get recommended videos that makes sense based on your history.This thing is anything but unordinary or weird to appear in someone&#39;s recommended.Why are people so fixated on the YouTube recommended algorithm. It seriously isn&#39;t that hard to comprehend.If you&#39;ve watched weird/ random videos, you get recommended more random videos.If you&#39;ve watched short videos, you get recommended more short videos.If you&#39;ve watched tech videos, you get recommended more tech videos.If you&#39;ve watched animal videos, you get recommended more animal videos.Cat videos, science videos, gaming, informative, cooking, news, etc.The more videos you watch - the less likely getting recommended something random is.

What if it falls on the screen side?

Fake

And then it falls on its screen

Merry Christmas!!

Is this meant to be a joke because it funny

Bruhh... My phone has airplane mode 😏

Who is watching this on iPhone 7 &amp; 😂

Am watching this in my iPhone with a broken screen

This is obviously fake. The iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack.

So, here is the headphone jack 🎃

Me: <b>Drops iPhone to see if it works</b>Phone: ima end this mans whole career

Now u know better

In 2020 people would just inhale the C02 instead of refilling it for there parachute

Reality: no headphone jack and sad hissing sounds 😂

But in 2020 no charger in the box

2020 iPhone 12 have the design of iPhone 5

iPhone 7: &quot;Parachute system&quot;Also iPhone 7: Has no parachute

A little late, I have an 11 pro

I did

Op

What if it drops on the screen side?

Commenting from 2058. They finally added this to the iphone! I cant wait to test it out next time Apple allows me to go outside!

Nah instead Apple made the backs of their phones out of glass and $600 to replace

Youtube be tripping sometimes bruh .

When this was released, I thought it was real.

😂

I have this with dubbel parachute 🪂

iPhone 7 out hear with a parachute system and my iPhone 12 doesn&#39;t come with a charger. Smh

Fun fact: You didn&#39;t search for this.       Like if you agree 👇👇😎

Recommendations are crazy bringing back old stuff

this is the most bullshit thing i have ever seen

Why does this makes giggle ?😂

That&#39;s the iphone 6s plus tf the 7&#39;s  obviously has no headphone Jack the first phone apple removed it from this is a smart a** comment because I dont know sh* abt the new phones lost track on dat

If you lost your tube, just blow it. Because we exhale co2 xD

Is that real?

I think it&#39;s a good investment

I thought this was a rumour

now : no charger .... and u can&#39;t repair the phone too :P oh and $1K plz

Even with no headphone jack, the battery size is only about 1700 mAh. I think this model doesn&#39;t included with the battery, isn&#39;t it?

Where can I get one

Google

Merry 2020 xmas

Me when I fart

This made me cringe lol

why tf is this recommended to me now

I like how the iPhone was running android

Who else getting the iphone 11 an skipping 12

That is very interesting.

thats really funny

Lol fake

XD

Cyberpunk 2077

In collaboration with spaceX

iPhone 7 in 2015: it will have a parachute systemiPhone 7 : this phone fucking dies when fall

2015: We expect features to be added to the phone.2020: Apple took away the charger 2 years after they took away the headphone jack.2030 - Apple: Announcing the new Iphone 22 with no screen (You have from your old one)...

what a fucking liar dude, what a fucking weasly little liar dudehe’s literally lying to his audience

My dude worked so hard on one idea he had after his phone fell from 5 cm high and cracked

Apple is too cheap and greedy with their phones to make this

So you&#39;re plane&#39;s crashing? Don&#39;t worry, your phone has a parachute!<b>But you don&#39;t</b>

The fact that it’s not even an iPhone 7

Add a small compressor so it can fly like the Mars rover skycrane thingy

Hi

Tesla: Wait! That is illegal

Was that an iPhone 7 with a headphone jack?

14 yrs me thinking it was real

The Co2 tank is in the loading center hahahahaha
The most unlegit shot I&#39;ve seen

Oh he cuz a little😂 air is gonna stop a phone

better a phone cover

Who would’ve thought that it would’ve had no headphone jack

iphone 12: LOL :/

Wow is rally bello cosa

Will the CO2 tank replacement be included with Apple Care +?

Why am I getting this??

if i had this phone i would just keep dropping it and refilling the co2 lol

Maybe in Cyberpunk😂

I m watching this with my iphone 7 and mine is definitely don t fall like a spaceship lol

Animators from 5 years ago have better ideas than apple now. How the tables have turned.

Bruh, only new thing is no headphone jack😂

This just shows what wrong way of development technology follows today.

I have the 7 and sure isnt this cool😅

Damn already 5 yrs
What about the front?

Bro apple couldn&#39;t even add a headphone jack, let alone a whole CO2 tank

I was 15 when this came out and i legit thought this was the leaked commercial for the new phone and shared this shit with my entire school and everyone believed it. And guess what how the iphone 7 came with no headphone jack. ._.

This ended well...

Mee

😂😂😂😂😂

&#39;New&#39;

Come on, I'm drooling
Is this real?

You have better specs instead apple 🤣🤣😍😍
We dont have a charger and you talkin about parachute

Cyberpunk 2077

iPhone 12 came out still no feature such as this

They dony have space to fit headphone jack how tf are they going to fit this shit

Who else getting this in their  recommeded in XMAS??? Happy XMAS BTW🔥❤️

what

Im just watching on my iph 7 and my phone is like “thats bull crap ma man.”

They don&#39;t even have  single hole for headphone jack, forget about this 😂🤣

Our iPhones had it it&#39;s just we didn&#39;t throw it that way.

Video:iphone 7 parachute systemIphone 12: nothing Hotel: trivago

Lmao 5 years ago ppl thinking the headphone jack was gonna stay 😌

Bullshit
<a href="">0:24</a> they got so pissed off of this fake marketing they even removed the jack in 7.

Imagine jumping with this phone and then its starting to spit CO2

Stop The Cap

Whoever&#39;s idea is this, it&#39;s bullshit

what if the phone dropped with the screen facing down??........ boost fall intensifies....

Actually brilliant

This is possible you can add a thruster but it would look the size of a spaceship but still has the same screen and the world is wonderful

Recommended iphone 7 in 2021 @.@

Is this really a thing?

Android: let me find my diaper

That wouldn&#39;t work anyways, because first of all the jet propulsions would make the phone do random flips and hit the ground harder and because our knoledge of jet propulsion and collinear calculation isn&#39;t that advanced yet.

my fucking iPhone12 cant even do that. wtf is wrong with technology nowadays...

As an iPhone 7 user I can confirm that this indeed is fake.

All fun and games till ur trying to put ur phone on ur table and it won’t stop hovering

And the Youtube algorithm brought all us back together once again...

who else threw their iPhone 7 from the balcony to see if it worked?

Phone: Falls screen facing downAlso phone: &quot;I&#39;m in danger&quot;

HAHA YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES OF COURSE

lol

What if it fell the other side tho

Hope iphone 13 will get it

It&#39;s not a parachute, it&#39;s a JETPACK!

mal

Definetly a 4chan prank lol

It&#39;s cool until it falls screen first ⚠️

wowww

Was I the only one who fell for this 5 years ago?

Who else thinks this is fake

Is this for real

They even added headphone jack 🤣🤣

The amount of cap we all beleived

It&#39;s fake, iphone 7 don&#39;t have 3,5 mm jack

Lel

Also new iPhones: WE rEmoVe hEadPhoNe jAckS anD stIlL doNt gIvE yOu AiR pOdS aS ThE DefAuLt hEad pHOneS

Me search in Amazon 😂 😂

They got lucky they have the limited edition Iphone 7 with a headphone jack wish mine had that.

Wow that&#39;s so amazing

Here I am with my iPhone 8+ and it can’t protect itself

iPhone XXX will let out rocket engine that can help your smartphone go to atmosphere and then detonate it self

This is more like spaceX crew dragon

Wow parachute system without parachute . And the CO2 cylinder sold separately.

Me: jumping from a airplane My friend : bro you didn&#39;t take parachute Me: I have iPhone 7 bro, so don&#39;t worry 😅

2017 will be the new 2007 pretty soon

when Elon Musk bought a phone

This is never possible with such a thin phone. 😒😒😒

5 years ago, In the year 2015, an I Phone appears &amp; everything changed                                      - Erehhh

Is this real ?

The hand looks real af

2020: N A H

Who else got dis recommended in 5years

What will happen if it falls frontside down?

Who else believed it before ?

Hello guys don&#39;t believe in it. It&#39;s fully animated

I actually thought this was really gonna happen, that’s how great apple used to be

Why did everybody got recommended after 5 yearsss

So its a phone with thrusters.

Iphone 7 : has parachuteIphone 12: doesn&#39;t include the charger in the boxIphone 13 : threre is no phone on the box

2 min silence for those thinking this is an inbuilt feature in Iphone 7

bruh imagine driving at 50mph and your phone randomly starts farting

Wait until this gets recommended 5 years later

apple&#39;s way of saying &quot;our phones are weaker than eggs so we are gonna charge you for stuff we told we would put but we didn&#39;t &quot;

Imahine when the phone falls upside down

WHY YOUTUBE RECOMMEND THIS IN 2021 ?

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hydraulic air system
This is what happen if Apple create a phone with SpaceX

maybe the reason why this is recommended to me after 5 years is because I can now afford it lol

Innovation...
Who else got Recomended after 5 years lol

iPhone 7 with headphone jack????? 😂😂😂😂😂

Apple wouldnt do this it would make them less money bc repairs and cases

That&#39;s not even a parachute

Shut up, I have aeroplane mode

2030: Phone sold separately

Haha funny headphone jack
Look at the size of the iPhone 7 Display 😂😂

But indian version doesn&#39;t have thatSad iphone 7 usersIncluding me

Well I have iphone 7s and I didn’t see any feature like this!!🤪🤪🤪

Is this real ?

They gave parachute in 2015 and now they removed charger in  iphone  12 next year  they will remove the whole mobile in iphone 13 and say buy 1000 dollars samsung

<a href="">

See yaal in 2 years when it gets recommended to me after 7 years bye bye ✌️🤞

Apple be like CO2 gas will cost extra 800$

Tbh thats a stupid concept

Me

HTMC

Ok but this is actually a good idea. Although you might as well just get a case lol

Keep on dreaming friendiPhone is still as the same

Fake video
Can’t believe I found this after 5 years 😂

When I saw the co2 I just said nah

iPhone concepts are better than the actual phones lol

Rip to all those people who thought it was real

Ah yes, better to over engineer a whole rocket propulsion system in a phone than just make the glass stronger

The announcement: iPhone 7 flies after touching the ground My iPhone 7: falls and breaks all the way off, Touch ID also gone*Me: constantly crying*

Bruh just get a good case and your giod

Nobody ; Apple products are fragileApple : instead of making it durable, we can make parachute.

im using an iphone 7 and still tried this feature

This some SpaceX elon musk type stuff

bruh we on the iphone 12 and this shits screen still breaks when it’s dropped from 3 feet

fake obviously apple will make us pay a million dollars for this feature

hahaha

I remenber when i got this in recommend 5 years Ago and believe this lol

5 years ago I would&#39;ve thought this was the coolest thing in the world. I still do ❤

This looks gud🎉<b>Looks at my money</b>;-;

Got recommended today

Fake

What we really wanted for 2020 not COVID

Now they give it to you in a pinshi bag.
in a real argument, how much thrust would it require to at least slow down the mass of the phone for impact prevention

Iphone 12: doesn&#39;t even include power cube

i stg these concepts are always objectively unrealistic

Nokias should have a parachute system to protect the floor

we wish

we wish

we wish

Funny how advanced we thought the future was gonna be

So this is the sign that i need to buy a new phone?

i bet theres a girl who would murder for those nails

5 year&#39;s ago

I know this fake but this is sick

I am the only one who wants to meet the person in charge of the recommendations? he must be a great person

Apple when see APPLE:NOOO BRAKE IPHONES BECAUSE AMERICANS NEED BUT NEWAMERICANS:WOW O2 SYSTEM IN IPHONE GOOD IDEA NOTHING:WHEN O2 TANKS ADDED TO IPHONE 12 APPLE:R.I.PAPPLE:SELL ONE RECHARGE FOR 99999$APPLE:LIVE APPLE TOO:  STONKS√√√

Why was the phone going towards the ground at 135 mph

Rocket thrusters on ya iphone

That would actually be cool and really convenient 😂

Nice concept. 😎
Starship Sn-9 looking pretty sick

Makes sense why google is recommending us this... they do hate apple

The funniest thing is that the iphone 12 has a bigger notch than the guy thought the iphone 7 would have..

Noice CB/ClickBaet

😅😅😅😅😅😂

Damn I wish I got that on my  iPhone 7

You know you wouldn&#39;t have to do this and end up skyrocketing the price of the phone up by 200% and just build a durable phone like everyone else

Thats what I expect of 800 bucks phone

Nobody:Youtube Algorithm: Lets remember this wonderful video.

IPhone 7 with mini jack. 1 minute of silence

This can never happen because apple makes money from repairs

jeez... i got this recommendation on 24th Dec 2020 😑

2020 : the phone come without charger2021 : we don&#39;t put the phone in the box

Lol if apple actually made this, they would be like &quot;iTs oNlY 9,999,9999$&quot;

It never happened XD
Pizza and noodles

Xdxdxdxdxz

And there&#39;s still not even a headphone jack

Apple: buy apple air now ($680)

Imagine apple actually adding a tank of co2 for 80 dollars per tank

Me

Promiseaa heck?
Wonder when everything went downhill

At last, some people got saved from having a heart attack.

They thought about that sht but after 5 years still don’t have 120hrz like what da fock

I saw this when It first came out and now it’s recommended 5 years later crazy

What do u think that is a Nokia!? Bruh that’s an iPhone a small drop like that could give you a broken display

Cool

Kinda funny tho, since 5 years ago they thought they got a rendering of a parachute mode in iphone7 but now we aren&#39;t even getting a charger in the box for iphone 12

Sorry telat 5 tahun

Make the phone durable that even if it falls nothing would happen. No need of such technology

😂😂😂😂😂😂

Or put on a fucking case

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Wtfffffff

cool idea but even 5 years later still pretty much impossible to fit that kind of tech into a phone

Oh chute I dropped my phone

Super necessary
nooo u idiots who created this video I ended up smashing my phone talking about parachute

This is not even real I am watching this on IPHONE 7

Me

this would be so cool omg

why my iphone 8 not look better that this?

I honestly thought that this was an ad, not a YouTube video

So thia is where Elon musk got the idea for falcon 9 booster landing

Wtf we really thought about that 5 years ago

YouTube recommendation is kind of funny

Dmn you Apple you dont have INNOVATION you guys are just improving the old technologies from other companies and tell to the people that you fckng invented it and call it innovation! Your Iphone design sucks too dfk Overprice Iphone12 with no charger brick and a fckng outdated 60hz refresh rate

parachute? they don&#39;t even give a charger.

no.

Why is this recommended now?

Youtube after 5 years: time to recommend 2015 videos 📹 👌

absolute lies, the iPhone i the vid is not landing screen facing down

Old world - films get popularNow - any YouTube algorithm/video get popular

Imagine. This phone in your pocket. One day you accidentally fall from the building. Then you fly and survived

My mom once dropped my iPhone 7 from the balcony, but I had Airplane mode turned on.

Who else got this in their recommendations in December 2020? (happy early Christmas to everyone celebrating!)

What is it falls upside down ? Then what ?

Its 2020 December , even iPhone12 cant do this. 🤣🤣🤣
Watch this in 2020 and lahuing so much

WOULD ACTUALLY THROW AWAY MY IPHONE 7 PURPOSELY NOW

Noob

Iphone 12 Pro max Rebirth of iphone 5 Came and parachute system will come after iphone 20

that&#39;s an iphone 6. obvious headphone jack. nc try

Lol

The cellphone repairman immediately went out of business
Stupid feature ever when it got realism

What if it fell sideways??!?...

Iphone concept:  <b>most advanced phone in the world</b> Iphone in reality:  <b>5 years old technology</b>

😂😂

Ha Ha.Still have headphone jack

That&#39;s cool

Why this recommend after 5 years

Someone actually tried and do it on their iPhone 7 seriously

When we thought this was real!

Yes, that's what it was.. you guys should be in that isro/nasa.
My phone have an airplane mode

Watched it 5 years ago And watching it again

Nice joke, even after fkin 5 years...
Ok cool... But what if it lands on the other side 😎😎

Ngl this concept is so well built and put together that it could have worked well if commercially launched

This shit funny

Why do I have a video of a rocket phone in my recommended?

I have to admit, that is pretty dope

Fuck parachutes we don&#39;t even gets charger now.
Youtube gathered us here again after five year.....

😂

This is so fake lolThere’s a headphone jack

Bro...they don&#39;t even have space for a headphone jack...where the hell will they put the CO2 tank😂😂

Who Else Thought This Was Real?

lol what

Finally 5 year video I got to see but not technology😂Scam 2015

Actually saw this video 5 years back but forgot to comment lol. It’s never too late

When you have the iPhone 7 and throw it because you saw this

Welcome to &#39;what is in my recommendation today&#39;   well its just getting better &amp; better.😉🤣

Do we tell him?

Apple doesn’t care enough about the public to release this very much real and secret feature

this is absolutely fake, why would they overthrow airplane mode off for something like this??

Expectation: ParachuteReality: HD screen resolution lmao

Wait is that really really real?

Who else wanted this to happen over 5 years ago

I tell you what if this was real I would spend my entire time with my phone just dropping it

Expectations:iPhone 7 parachuteReality:iPhone 12 without charger

Loooool parachute
so....we all are here today

Economically this doesn&#39;t make sense. Why would they protect your device, when they can sell you a new one?

Wow my iPhone 7 must have missed the update too mad my 11pro doesn&#39;t have this

Welcome to the space age, where everything including your phone has RCS thrusters.

I want it

Genial KKKKKKKKKK
After taking out the headphone jack and when they take out the charging port they actually have room for this but we’re not getting it

And to think that now in mere 2020 they don't even want to sell them with a charger or headphones.
I remember when this video came out

“CYBER PUNK”

Someone time travel at the past LamaoRecommend after 5 years 🙄

NASA works with iphone now

The gas is nearly not enough to do something like that

retro thrusters

Wait, is this real?

Thanks YouTube.This was a life-changing video.

That’s not an iPhone 7, it’s got a headphone jack

This is Snk iphone

It seems YouTube recommendations have brought us all together

the 21K dislikes are from the people who thought that was real and tested it

I was not the only one who got this in recommendation after 5 years

LMAO

Me

5 years ago? Who else got the same recommendation?

“Add CO2 gas”Apple: Yeah, that’s going to run you about $500 for each one.

tf

Yall know that this is actually possible right??

i could do without an epileptic seizure

<b>who got this recommended since 5 years ago... like if you did</b>

Umm idk but I’m pretty sure an iPhone 7 don’t have a headphone jack

Or just make tougher phones ..

me in ksp:I swear i&#39;ill play normal this time

5 mins. later:

Hoax

So when will the i phone 7 come out?

This is an iPhone 6 lol

hahah

XD

Gotta love the archaic ideas back in the day about future tech up there with holographs, modular phones and 3D screens lmfao.

2020 still shit phone
Me in 2020: “dang this would be cool rn ngl”

Ngl i was expecting a full on parachute to come out of it but aight

If Elon Musk owns Apple

This is an iPhone 6 and not an iPhone 7

I can&#39;t believe we actually thought we would get this lol I remember I was so excited cuz my mom was gonna get one

This is a concept. It literally says that in the description. Stop moaning that it&#39;s not real.

funny buІІshіt
thats an iphone 6 ngl

But what happens if it falls upside-down 🤔😬

Looking back at this in 2020 made me laugh

İf steve jobs was alive that could be possible

Lmao

Imagine the alternate universe where apple made this...

2015:they told there would be parachute 2020: charger separate in other boxThanks for the likes!!

Pretty sure that’s not a parachute but more like thrust reversers😂 Better than no charger tho

just watching this on a broken iphone7

Oh hey, I remember this concept! Lots of people thought that it would actually be added at the time, haha

this would be very sick!

when these fan made videos are much much better than apple itself---

I once threw a plane with phone mode on

What?

Yup, just like the actuals

A memont of silence to those who actualy believe this is true.

why did i get this on my recommeded after 5 years?

Bruh iphone trash

Apple seems focused on making phones that we would see in futuristic movies and go “oh wow they would be cool” except they’re trying to show us how impractical that stuff would be 😂

I hope we can all tell that’s not a iPhone 7 because it has a headphone jack. Plus the head phone jack is on the wrong side. Either way. Good concept of a new phone parachute

You must be embarrassed to watch this 5 years after you posted this

There are 5 more now......... Well done YouTube algorithm

Nah, it looks plausible on sketch bench, but realistically speaking, this will never happen with today&#39;s technology. Do they know how much thrust force is needed to just lift a static phone off the table? Let alone to do what was illustrated in this video, break the accelerating phone&#39;s speed, and make it hover and land slowly.It can be done, but not with that small form factor of co2 container and pipe system. It&#39;s like, &quot;using a battery AA size to power an electric car for 100 miles&quot;. It just can&#39;t be done with today&#39;s (and in near future) technology....

I’ve saw this in iPhone 7 without parachute system :(

2020: Iphone 12 - No charger system

2015 : saving a phone with air pressure.2020: getting pressure due to carona .

Lol recommendation after 5 years and after watching this laughing in the corner of my room

This would be super cool

Waaaowww

I remember seeing it before the release...

Bruh just put it on Airplane mode

Smol but stronk nozzles

Shut the f off youtube after 5years.

anyone got this on recommended today?

prototype: EXISTMe:IRON MAN PHONE

After 5years I&#39;m lmao

somehow we believe this 5 years ago

Cant believe it came out 5 years ago

What of it fall other side

Getting blasted in the face with air

Lmao y we all getting dis in our recommendations 5 years lateer

iPhone 12 <b>Charger sold separately</b>
Where is Ray Mak?

When the phone fall in wrong direction the jet will activate and that phone hit more hardly

Ig parachute is sold seperately

This deserves an XD

Five years ago they were putting parachute system in it and now we don&#39;t get an headphone jack 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

lmao

Who else got this in thier recommended?

The Good Old Days When we thought this would be there 🥺

When people are more innovative than an entire decade of Apple.

iPhone 2077

Do iPhone 7 Plus have parachute system ?

We can fart on the headphone jack to fillup co2 tank

I just tried this with my iPhone 7 Plus Fml it’s a lie

Legends got fooled by buying this brand new iphone7

Parachute mode my arse! My phone has been having Gravity sensor that removes Gravity of Earth before falling.... Actually, whenever a rocket is launched NASA, ESA, JSA OR RUSSIAN SPACE all of them ask me to turn off gravity so that they can launch their rockets... It&#39;s my phone that&#39;s keeping Moon in orbit..... Woooff

these concepts are getting too far💀

Back when leaks were fun

Who else is watching this 5yrs later?

Me: watching this on iphone 7

Some people just got this recommended

Good toys i can refill Co2 and fucking Drop it and doing like this Again XD

So fake the iphone 7 has bin out for 5 years haha

Who else got this in their recommendation after the launch of iphone 12

Next big thing iphones series launch will be &#39;one time use disposable iphones&#39;

This is sick

Apple would never do that as they want to charge you $1000 dollar to replace the screen duhh.

Haha

It&#39;s Tech destruction proof
When i was a kid i expect air plane mode to be something like that lmao😂😂😂

Did I try dropping my mums iPhone 7: yeaDid the parachute system work:NoDid I get beat:Yes

Wahahahahah. Apple wishes they had such a feature! Their phones are so featureless it&#39;s sad! Yet people still buy them

Who stills watching this in 2077？

Olu thevaiyaane alavu

It’s pointless and will never happen. By implementing CO2 Module what you do is to just taking so much more space where you can fit more battery, ram or memory. It’s not practical and people are more willing to spent money on a new case rather than on a new pointless feature which is going to only complicate the devise further.

Each time you drop your phone you also drop 60% of battery

Iron man be like: 👁👄👁
Who else noticed that&#39;s an iphone 6 not 7

Nice recommend after 5 years xD I never heard about that

No

IPhone 156 : protecting A human from falling... But still no headphone Jack 😬

2020: iPhone 12 &amp; SE 2nd. Gen.  still no parachures

Who else thought it was real?Oh... it&#39;s just me

Best way to cool your phone when your playing gamed

2020 : Iphone 12 . God damn MageSafe

Hey guys I just got widgets in ios 14

Is this real

Isn&#39;t it obvious that it is animated?

Everybody phones be undamaged till it lands on the corner then they gotta pay 500 to fix the damage

It was recommended 5 years later cause this one&#39;s the upcoming iphone 13

Bruh, as if apple would even care to implement this, lol

Honestly this would be so cool to have on a phone

If you found my comment over 10000 comments, congrats.At least it has a charger

If it’s faulty will it explode?

It looks fake because the co² tank is too small for me and I think it will not provide that much pressure to lift that phone itself if it can&#39;t lift the phone it means it can&#39;t handle falling phone because the falling gravity is making the phone much heavier it&#39;s the same like jumping on the weight meter your weight will increase when you land and back to normal when it&#39;s jumping back.

Instructions unclear, there were 3 pieces on the floor when i dropped it off my second floor.

I see tiktok girls intentionally dropping that phone for challenges

iphone 7p

Me at 2015: 👁️👄👁️
ME TO THE VIDEO WAT THE FUCK

I think it exists in the parallel universe .

Apple: The idea we can&#39;t invent it yet.

Last week of 2020, iPhone 12 mini just release, WHERE IS MY F*<b>**</b> PARACHUTE!!!!

WTF

Who else is watching this on an iPhone 7 or 7 plus??

I think its gonna blow  on your face cause co2 tak with high press

Imagine refilling the co2 tank on your iPhone

And there was a time when i belived that this was real

Android phones: <b>I don&#39;t have such weaknesses</b>

In 2020We don&#39;t give our customer the charger because we care about the fucking plastic shit pollution... But we do wrap our box and the useless thing with plastic so no worry, buy apple

Who need gorila glass?
2020: iPhone 12. Still don&#39;t have parachute

Lol they couldn&#39;t even fit a headphone jack😂

watching this on my 8gb iphone 7

Apple saves screenSamsung doing few drops to broke hisself and then you need new phone

2020: still no parachute and they even took away the phone&#39;s charger.Holyshit, almost 2k likes. Tks, guys

Why not build a bulletproof iphone instead, it tough enough to handle an impact to the ground

iPhone 12 still no parachute

Nobody&#39;s talk about how genius is this guy

hold my iphone 12

2020: iphone 12 have paracute?

AHAHHAAHHAHHAAHHAHAHAAHAHAH

Ok but that’s an iPhone 6

In a parallel universe too Apple ditched Headphone jack over CO² gas recharging port.
who asked?

Physics: allow me to introduce myself 😂

2 minutes of silence for those who think it&#39;s real.....It&#39;s completely CGI 😆

Wow even i phone 12 pro max does not have this features 🤣

Headphone jack... How cute xd

When I was 8 I thought this was actually true😂

2015: Apple will have parachute system2020: Removed 3.5mm  jack, charger, headphone

Someone here in December 2020?

What if it drops on the screen side?🤷🏻‍♂️

If it had a headphone jack

JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK JACK
The earphone jack shall be appreciated😊

It’s not iPhone 7 it’s iPhone 6S

The fcuk man,Hopefully some kind of mechanism, similar to this one but of course more practical, will be included in the future smartphone cases.

2020 and i am still searching for a proper charger and earphones in the box i havent found any facking parachute

They wouldn’t do this be cuz apple wants money from repairs

iPhone 7 with headphone jack??It&#39;s more like an iPhone 6CO2 Pro max.. air

It has a headphone jack

2020 iPhone 12 Still no parachutes

2020: iPhone 12, Still no parachutes

Is this real

2020 hmmm i dont think so

Iphone 7 (2015):  Parachute SystemIphine 12 (2020): Charges and the headphones not coming in the box 👍

&quot;That will cost another 5000$&quot;

XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

I mean, this is pure madness! Great job 👍 But one question, any news of this concept after 6 years?

It's an iPhone 6
2020: iPhone 12. Still no parachutes :/

This would take up way too much space that could be used for the battery or better parts.

Youtube algorithm : Lets Make Fun of Apple

biggest cap

Headphone jack on iPhone 7 😂😂😂
Some people are so dumb
Just use airplane mode

Lol imagine getting this recommended this 5 years later and it was a lie smh

Hi im from 2020 and you think apple has advanced Actually it has taken off charger and earpods from the box

I trieed with my iphone 7 and it broke

2020: no parachute and they removed the headphone jack and now it comes without the charger. Waiting for them to start selling the screen separately.

If this where to be real on the future, that would actually be really cool, and the only thing that Apple had created, at least useful

FAKE!!!!!

iPhone 12 has special rocket mode to go on moon

2020 : Iphone 12

2019 : Iphone 11

Headphone.jeck.. Hahahahah

Thanks but my Samsung has airplane mode ✈️

Do that was a fucking lie

Apple: iPhone 7 is now included with parachuting systemAlso apple: <b>CO2 Sells separately for $999 a bottle</b>

Dec 2020 :  iPhone 12, still no parachute.

This guy used to think that apple will add a parachute system in iphone in 2015Actually in 2020 apple : removes charger and headphones from the box

5 phones later, still cant do that

.

My friend suggested me to buy an iPhone 7 when I tried to buy a flagship Samsung phone because of parachute system on iPhone 7.Just imagine how hard I laughed internally.

I did not know the iPhone 7 had such amazing technology

<b>CO2 sold separately</b>

2020 i phone 12 , still no parachutes instead they removed the chargers

XD

Anyone else got this recommended 2020?

2020. Still no parachutes

Well iphone 12 pro max is kinda the same as iphone 11 pro max but im not an apple fan boy tho

i phone 12 😁 smile on ass

I think the parachute system on my phone is failure.

iPhone 12 pro max ultra 512GB 5g :Still no parachute mode 😂

Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch?

Iphone 12 is launched but still no parachute mode😭

Why is this being recommended to me now

Elon saw this and started Space X

Meanwhile Apple launches iPhone 12 without charger.

Shot on iphone

Brother, you have so much panty that you have to wait till you go, and which bitch will throw your iPhone down to test your song's parachute.
I knew it after 5 years it would be recommended

iPhone 12 still no parachute

I think that&#39;s fart system 😅

Anyone here after 12
I got fooled once

paracachute system activates*battery:oh god please kill me

Yogammına
you could literally tell it was fake cause apple has never been innovative in this time

iphone7 2050.

Watching on iPhone 11 and I’m sad that this feature is not in my phone.

2020:battery draining2016:CO2 draining

anyone else get this in their recommendations 5 years later 💀

people make these things way too high tech for the time

I thought this would be a complete joke but they’ve actually thought it out a bit.

It&#39;s all fun and games until you drop it on your face while you&#39;re in bed

They thought the 7 would have a headphone Jack 😂

wow headphone jack

Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch

when fart is actually being innovated

iPhone 12 be like

I have the iPhone 7 Plus :v
iPhone 12, still in airplane mode, no parachute

Cant wait for Iphone Jihad Pro Max with built in bomb.

Bro wtf?
Anyone here after Iphone 12 launch

Imagine it&#39;s falling screen first and just plummets to the ground

5 yrs ago when i buy my first iphone was 7+ and when i saw this i was like wow my phone is soo cool

How it started: iPhone 7 with parachute

How it&#39;s going: iPhone 12 without charger

Lovin that headphone jack

iPhone 12 pro max - forget about parachute, there is no bloody innovation. Apple died along with Jobs

My phone has aeroplane mode it can fly

Imagine if it fell on top of a river or water and for a split second you went to grab it and it fell down...

Can I have 5k likes

My phone can fly with airplane mode🤣🤣

No.Apple wants you to break the phone and buy a new one and make it to break.That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have an iPhone

Airplane mod be like : awww cute

iPhone 12: STILL NO GODDAMN PARACHUTES APPLE WHERE ARE YOU

The iPhone 7 is the same as the 6s it just has the A10

Lol

Looks like a 4chan propoganda

Everyone gangsta till the iPhone falls on the screen side of the phone

Seing this in the end of 2020 is different

Inspired by attack in titan

Expectation vs. Reality💔Oh my sweet god😂At least give us some more free apps to download😂😂

Bruv the 12 doesnt have it

<a href="">more.com</a> <a href="">more.com</a> <a href="">more.com</a>
A case with so many things could do the thing though, your ideas are totally unrelated, apple has no space for phone protection in phone

Its fake

There was a comment on TikTok that said if it fell in the opposite direction it would accelerate.
Recommended after iPhone 12 launch 😒

So that&#39;s why they removed the headphone jack....

Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch? 😂

Who watches it with iphone 7 now?

iPhone 12 still no parachute

It&#39;s 2020 But apple still not come with this feature yet 😂😂😂

Bro that’s an iPhone 6

My only question... is that real?I&#39;ve heard about it.. bt I&#39;m not sure

What if it falls upside down?

Hey it&#39;s iphone 12 pro now,There was a lighter, AC, parachute, CO2 gas, lazer, ATM all of them added. Wow! Great work Apple 👏👏

Dude you think Apple is the best innovator . You are so dum

5 years later, I realized this will never happen because it probably gonna cost you more to refill the CO2 than just buy a new phone....

Leaks about the iPhone 13 still have no parachutes. Apple when?

I phone 12 ?

Based in atack an titan

Can thes kill you

2020: Apple has removed the charger

Dislikes are mistaken of having a headphone jack.

It looks like the falcon 9.Oh, so this is why they couldn&#39;t make an iphone 9...

Parachute mode sold separately. Starting at $1999, not including the CO2 Cylinders.

Hehehe
I phone 12 has launched. But no parachute system expecting this innovation in iphone 50

The fake future 😂😂😂😂Lol jke

Paul walker: lets fill my iPhone with nos😶Vin diesel : hold my charger 🚙

Here after IPhone 12 launch. Still no parachute.

Is that just an animation?

2020

When you realise it has a headphone jack

If this was real I would not even buy iPhone 12 pro max I should buy this

What if you step on it what happeneds

Iphone 12 from 2020 see this video : 👁👄👁

It’s not a iPhone 7

That was so stupid

Apple wouldn’t do that because if you drop your phone it breaks and that means it’s time to get a new phone 💸💸

If only this was true

you know, really, I would prefer this to an infinite screen...

Still room for a headphone jack

anyone here after iphone 12 launch

watching this video on ip7 with broken screen because the parachute isn’t able to use :(

And iphone 12 with teleport action ✌🏻🥰

What is this? Shit?

But why theres an headphone jack?

Iphone 12. Still no parachute mode.

You are calling the iphone 6 the iphone 7

iPhone 12 still doesn’t have a parachute. Smh

Nokia 3310: that is just useless

2020 iPhone 12 no brick in the box

GREAT concept. But what if the battery runs out? 😅🤣

Look!!! A headphone jack!
Here Apple is tryna take away the charging port and any other port that can exist on an iPhone and this dude 5 years ago was innovating with more ports lol

If you fall off the screen, the gyro sensor won't be able to reach you in time, so you'll probably get boosted by gas and hit the ground lol
Lol I am watching this fake video on iPhone XS

It has a cO2 tank bigger than the Apple Tatic engine, and HAS A HEADPHONE JACK, aPpLe!

Why so fake???

2015: We Will Have iPhones That Cant break2020: Haha home button go brrrr

Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch

lol who here in 2020 dec?

Came 3 months after 12 pro

I saw this when the iPhone 6 was released but this still looks breathtaking

It's not a bad idea but Apple would no longer win by changing broken screens
imagine if this would really exist

<b>this is for people who are so clumsy they drop there phone all the time</b>

should really add this 4 the price :/

There was a period when iPhone was so innovative, people actually believed in theae concept videos

&quot;Oh hang on guys, need to fill my phone with CO2 real quick&quot;

Why is tony stark hiding inside while the phone dropped down 😂😂😂

2020 iphone 12 😅😅😅

Samsung: we just created a phone that can survive a 100ft fallApple: Finally, a worthy opponent.

If this was real (and I know it&#39;s not) all phones made back then should have this

I mean, the 7 is still fairly durable...

Did u share to iPhone people

Very interesting.... even is its fake

Great, now you need an Anti-Dog system to preventing it to eat my phone.

His Phone: Has parachute mode and acts like it.My Phone: Has Airplane mode but can&#39;t fly.

I want to die

Imagine if it malfunctions and just slams your phone into the ground even harder

Fake

Uf IPhones actully had this system

I will let my phone fall down instead of that nonsense

Aaaaa I got a 5 watt charger and no headphone jack

Now America can send i on mars.

There’s one problem : it has a headphone jack

IPhone 12 (2020)  still no parashutes

APPLE :2016 : introducing parachute SystemAPPLE:2020: introducing Apple wheels 😂😂

Silly

I just use 7+ and it’s looks funny

Watching it in 2020 as z joke of that time

This defenitely would cost 10 ferari to buy

Apple in 2025: &quot;We presenting new iPhone with parachute... ONLY $15000 for this new innovation..!!!&quot;

My i phone 11 pro brocken on a single fall😂😂😂😂

What s happen if you forget recharge the CO2 ?

*iphone 6 xddddd

Imagine you clicked airplane mode and The phone would fly

Xiaomi might implement this one!!!

I wish this was real...

Let’s be honest. Android probably will have this feature before apple does

This looks like a game

Me with the iPhone 7: I wish

It's already a smartphone-type drone lol
That is a iphone 6

I remember when my friend thought it&#39;s real and told me...

You drop it, but realize you forgot to recharge it

Recommended in lockdown who else

Lol

Wait didn&#39;t phones develop airplane mode already?
that&#39;s an iPhone 6 lol

But what if it falls towards its screen? Obviously it will shatter •-•

ONLY FOR $3000 :D

Fake

My Samsung has airplane modeApple: ya us too.Me:mine doesnt flyApple: mine does.😜😜😜😜😜😜🤣🤣🤣🤣

2020?🤣
Played well YOUTUBE😂

2020 jock!
Well, all Apple did was remove a hole.

Apple be like:We would suggest our customers that if they want these features then they would have to pay 50% more of the original price if the phone

Hahaha iPhones always make 3 farts
Ok so my phone and my iPad have airplane mode and …

Fake

<b>*tries to plug in headphone jack*</b>&quot;WHY ISNT IT GOING IN&quot;

Haha😂😂

I like the real life perspective

Anyone here in 2020, seeing this video and laughing how we use to predict the upcoming iphone and get excited that it’s gonna have an parachute mode 😂

Thats an iPhone 6

Abey saale...
You are a saint
Hahahahahahahahaha
I hope my iPad also does this too.

The parachute system would be strong enough for that little tank. The tank would need to fill up the entire space of the phone for that. even so, it still wouldn&#39;t work.

The stupidest thing I've ever seen
This channel : <b>The only source we can trust!!!!</b>

That is iphone 6 not 7 cuz its still has a headphone jack

I got an iPhone 7 a few weeks ago

1 Tour Recharge Gas?!

I have tried that way and my phone is break 😭😭

wow if apple realesed it that will like 6000 dollar phone

Air drop 😂😂😂
I get recommend in 2020Anyone?

If only this was real

Idiot its an iPhone 6!

Really wish it was real.

WTF

İs this real

Can someone tell me what song I use?
I have an iPhone 7 with a headphone jack and running a crappy android ripoff!!!

ironically the iPhone 7 is displayed to have a headphone jack.

That aint even an iphone 7

Prank it.

iPhone 7 with headphone jack and parachute system: €1999CO2 tank: €199

how tf do u charge it lol the co2 tank covers the charger lol

Abeyea chal

Nostalgia
Good Idea

it still doesnt do this :(

Fake
I don’t need epilepsy in the first few seconds

But what if you ran out of gas and no where to buy it?

It&#39;s not parachute it&#39;s RCS mode

Me &quot;sees&quot; Also me &quot;throws phone down a staircase&quot;

If the iPhone 7 is water resistant then why does it have holes for parachute mode 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Airplane mode may actually make it fly, but this one is like someone activating a parachute.

fake

The must untrue thing in this video:iPhone 7 with a headphone jack

Wtf

Thats not a parachute my dude thats retro burning

Iphone 7 is here but without this fucking parachute.this is so fucking ad

and the gas  will cost 5928436892431038642586343478564378 dollars

But what if it land on front of the screenIlluminati confirm

If it existed in a single iPhone:

That&#39;s a 6S not 7 and it wouldn&#39;t be possibleAlso that&#39;s not a parachute

Who is watching this in 2020 for fun 😂😂

Apple is slacking rn. Iphone 11 and 12 are pretty much exactly the same and they havent even started on a foldable phone yet

2050: iphone 111 still no parachuteedit: i think there will be no youtube not only parachute

That is more fake then the glowstone portal in Minecraft

I thought the phone will automatically use a parachute when it falls.

What program is using pleasee?

iPhone 7: <b>PaRaChUtE</b>iPhone 11: Let me introduce myself

Ist of all, iPhine 7 aint got no headphone jack, so im not stupid

No matter how hard the parachute system will try to protect your phone, atleast the screen will crack

Now less of heart attacks

This is fake the floor is a paid actor

What about airplane mode?

People in 2015: wow a phone with gas People in 2016: this is bullshit iPhone 7 only have good camera😂😂

This could be some special edition iPhone 12 (when it comes out

Fake

41

Yeah, that never happened

seeing this in 2020... CRINGE.

The design is nice, it would have been better if Apple had done this, but even the iPhone 11 still does not have a parachute. QĞQQOKAAKZJSWĞA
😂😂😂😂 Wat a scam

Omg this is iphone 6 and iphone 7 dont haive headphone jack

This is fake part

<a href="">0:11</a> omg new iPhone 6 parachute <b>its a iPhone 6s I can see</b>

This is SO unrealistic! It has a headphone jack!

For the carbon dioxide thing can u just breath it out or u have to buy it from Apple? Also if Apple sells that it&#39;ll probably be like $200

Little did we know it was identical

2015: no2016: no2017: no2018: no2019: no2020: <b>YESS!</b>

What if the phone is falling backwards then due to air pressure it will fall with greater speed that is why companies don&#39;t use the idea

That is an iPhone 7 with a headphone port.

This is perfect phone what I thought

My have bike mode

Yah man it is 2020

Fake,hahaha.

Nice joke .....Hey wait 2019 here 🐸

This should litterally be a standard feature

wtf? Ip7 with a headphone jack??

What a comedy bro . I will laugh tomorrow

That is just bullshit. Look at the fucking capacity of that co2 tank! It will probably run out and fall to death! Even more bullshit is the power of the RCS thrusters. I’m gonna say this in caps because it is important, ITS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THAT DAMN POWER OUTTA THE FUCKIN THRUSTERS WITHOUT RUNNING OUT OF CO2!

They leaked a headphone jack

This is perfect

Do the iPhone 12 with à 3d flexible screen

I&#39;m young and I know this is fake cause you would have to refill the air every so often

Apple wants you to break your phone ySo you buy another

The biggest lie ever Headphone jack

Idiot

ExpectedIphone : Having A Parachute SystemReal Iphone: Not Even A Headphone Jack!!!!!!

This bullshit is beautiful
When I was younger I thought this was real

Ah yes an iPhone 7 with a headphone jack

Whats funny is that iPhone 7 doesn’t have headphone jack

My phone&#39;s got airplane mode

Who else is watching this with a Android deviceMake this blue👇🏻

I think this is November fool

<b>We didnt even get the headphone jack...</b>

That would be cool if they did that

Lmao my concept is a friggin headphone jack

iphone 7 with parachute systemphone case : am i a joke to you?

I can have a better tech , known as “case”

This phone would just contribute even more to climate change 🤦

Why should apple solve this problem when space-x has still problems with this 😂

Dumb fuck, this is fake, gay kid!!

Apple would make one that purposely makes your phone land on the screen so you have to pay them to fix it.

I see no parachute
<a href="">0:48</a> I read &quot;Add CO2 Gay&quot;

iPhone 7 with mini jack ahahahahahhahahaha

Iphone 11: antigravity system

Talking about parachute.....This phone doesn&#39;t even have a simple headphone jack

its 2019 November iphone 11 pro max has no sign of parachute 😂

What is it cost 😂😂

Instructions unclear now going back to iPhone 4

I’m watching this from my iPhone 11 Pro Max ;-;

I have iphone 7 and it does nothings like this

Seriously? This will happen in 2744

People in 2019

Hahahaha LOL
Don&#39;t try this at home. 🤣

People in 2019: what the Fuck is this

Where is parachute?:)))Like if you don’t have a parachute for iphone

Wtf (Welcome To Finland) I try it on my ip7 and it’s Was crack! :(

What a wrong assumption

Don&#39;t need parachute system I have a nokia

I have airplane mode LoL

Reality:iPhone 113 cameras
What if the phone falls upside down?

If Elon own apple

Wow
Apple : we took out headphone jack to create some spaceMe : please tell me it is for the co2 cylinders 😂😂😂😂

It&#39;s available in animated iPhone,. Who will use 😆😆😆😆😆

This is ExpectationReality:dropped iPhone at 600ft IPhone screen broke

Fake as fuck

hoax

Buy it for 3000$!!

Fake

Looks like great CGI

apple be tripping,....most dumbest shit ever  ...

totally fake as no head phone jake in iphone 7

I bet you this will actually be a thing within the next 5 years.

128k subs sab ke sab unsubscribe kro is channel ko lol

if samsung can insert entire pen in mobile then why con&#39;t you add that gas tank along with our favorate headphone jack...and 2 minute silence for those and who thought it was real and 2 hours silence for those who still think it is real even after iphone 11 launch...

What if it falls in front

Watching this on a iPhone 7 😂

Very finny

I’m using iPhone 7 and I don’t have any parachute 😂😂😂😂

iPhone 📱 11 with airplane

Fucking Fake

Only open-source Android companies would make this. An air pump would constantly replenish the thrusters while flying or being used throughout the day.  The phone would also hover and fly like a drone in any orientation thanks to the nozzles mounted on a gimbal system. VERY COOL.

LUSO NINYO

And we are calling it:<b>Hoverboard.</b>

what non sense......if so send this concept to space.x ...the worked for years and are stiffe failing

Why is this in my recommended after 4 years

lol they predicted parachute and apple went ahead and removed the headphone jack

Price is just 1million dollars 😂

One minute have 10 sec commercial

They probably know how to do that but would never cuz they neee us to break it so we coule buy another so they could be more rich

People in 2015 : We will get immortal mobilePeople in 2019:Dame to costita ah aha ah ai

Parachute? My phone has airplane mode.

Troll of the century....

This concept is pretty useless tho, as Gorilla Glass dominates on the market.

Android has jet boosters so HAH

Apple after seeing thisApple: <b>Dumb people there is no place for headphone jack i said</b>

<b>Its all good we have airplane mode</b>

CreAte one of dis sonitdac please I want u to create each u design see if they work

Wow

How much that co2 tank cost.. Umm i got it.. Its just one eyeball..

Did anyone else think this was a joke video?

*Co2 gas tank sold separately

totaly fake but nice animation

Hey we can&#39;t make a good softland technique and you are saying automatic softlanding technique of mobile

who is watching in 2019 🤦🏻‍♂️
What if it falls on the screen 😂

Where i can find RCS thrusters?1.Spacecrafts2.This video

My phone has bike modeBetter than u

Nice vid man. Nothing is special here. And the back side of the phone looks like iphone 6.

Give me few seconds, I have to go to the toilets...<b>HAHAHA</b>

This guy just wants subs. And...🤬

Teacher no one will lie , Apple 7

If apple makes this system then how are they going to make profit by repairing

what if it falls with its screen facing down?

iPhone’s in 2030🤣😂
iPhone 7 - NahhiPhone 8 - No yet iPhone X - Yesn&#39;t iPhone 11 - Youtube - HOLLY FUCK YOU MUST SEE THE NEW IPHONE 7 WITH PARACHUTE SISTEM!!!

Instead of this they make the back out of glass.....

ahh chile lmao

I&#39;m still wondering how iPhone 7 has a headphone jack

Why am i watching this after the launch of iphone 11?

This is so dumb

Is it real

It&#39;s have a headphone jack😯

Lol it has an headphone Jack

50% of the comments: “wHy iS thIs oN My rEcOMmeNdeD?”Answer: because YouTube can.

Subscribe to my YouTube channel just click this logo

Iphone 9 has it

What was it .. Malappuram knife , machine gun .. Now it has reached 11 pro max .. First of all the one who makes this kind of rumor video should be beaten .. iphone ❤️
O need to learn that riff

This is the best channel of making phone fan-made i have seen so far...

It still has a headphone jack.

Who is watching this film from iPhone 7?

Wish we already have this technology because I recently broke my iPhone 7.

No one:Still no one:Iphone 11:Dude i don&#39;t even have underwear to protect me 😏

this is real ?

These ideas are just dumb i dont mean to hate its so insane man😂😂

why is this in my recommendations

Youtube &quot;Algorasm&quot; recommended this shit

No headphone jack
i think ive bought the iphone 7 without opting for a parachute system,, they didnt give me headphone jack to refill😂

I’m from the future this doesn’t happen

Watching on a iPhone XR

Whose seeing this and laughing at 2030

Where Is The Parachute???Landed As If On Mars! 😑

I expected the date of upload would be april 1st

<b>drops phone face down</b>
iphone case sellers: aight imma head out

I&#39;m getting a 7 soon, can&#39;t wait for my parachute and earphone jack, this 6 is trash.

It’s funny because the iPhone 7 haven’t the jack enter

If u smoke it automatically charges the co2 tank

I was freaked out when i saw this concept for the first time back in 2016......

Well when we thought apple could innovate 😂😂

So many hopes and they scarified jack

Apple selling the  co2 charging tank 200$ separately

Make this a case 😂😂

Seems legit
Yeah iPhone 11 with rocket launch system it can go to mars take a selfie with aliens and come back to earth innovation by Apple

This is a substitute incase the airplane mode stopped.

I don’t understand how this got 14 million views like this is so cringe. And if it were to be true that they were implementing this on any iPhone you’re probably losing the power button volume button front camera and you already lost the headphone jack. What more can you lose now.

never heard of phone cases

Haha this fucking video sucked 😂😂😂
2019 anyone???

2049 iPhone 69 no humans no live on earth and still no parachute

Where my 2019 gang

That&#39;s why they removed headphone jack

2019 anyone

Watching this in 2k19 nothing like this lol

This is actually cool Apple : then how will we repair your phone for 500 dollor?

I tried to do with my iPhone 7 and 😭😭😭😭

We don&#39;t need parachutes when our phone has Airplane mode. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t see a parachute.....

Just keep it on airplane mode. It should just take off once it falls.

These fucking comments

When Elon musk starts making phones

Everybody look at the descriptionIt says Iphone 7-Parachute System <b>Concept</b>

Ok tell me why they haven’t started this yet ?

Is it true

Hahahaha who is in 2019

Qhahaah fakeeeeeee
How do you activate on 7plus?

YouTube recommendations brought us back together it seems,see ya all in another 4 years.

People were waiting for air jet in iPhones. And Apple removed the headphone jack.

Who else remembers seeing this video back then?

No not even close

Still don’t understand how this would work with a case🤔

Fake, but good idea tho

<b>adds co2</b> Ah yes. Time for another go.

Thats a...6

¿¿¿ Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 2019/2020. ????
Not even the iphone 11 is safe from a 3 foot drop

it’s a iPhone 6....

That’s not even the 7😂

Yeah I see that headphone jack. That ain’t a 7

Dreams and dreams))))

epic

I will pay good money for a case that does this

Da fuck!!?
That’s a iPhone 6

That air tank size probably holds the equivalent of 1 segment of bubble wrap

my iPhone 7 is broken, or I don’t have this function :(

The CO2 RECHARGE system alone cost $600**Charges of CO² NOT included 🤣😂

Who&#39;s here in 3021?

What if phone falls screen side 😂

I know this is fake, but I wonder if this could ever be possible in the future? Or is this too advanced to fit on such a small piece of hardware.

Well, my iphone 7 has tsunami mode

Looks like a headphone jack

Co2 can only $999 at Apple :)Would be a good idea to have irl though

Man... I wish I was this good at graphic design and video development

If it falls with my headphone jack the co2 will make the headphones fucked up

I just tried it with my I 7, now it dosen&#39;t switch on.Maybe I should&#39;ve switched on airplane mode. 🤔

2019 : Iphone 11 . Still no parachutes

Did ya know that when I first heard of airdrop I thought that this was airdrop 🤣🤣

Umm recommended in 2019 and I own a iPhone 7

Damn, wasn’t made on 1 April...

Who’s here after the iPhone 11 pro is out

So gay

bruh
I wish this true

How dare companies lie at us that&#39;s so gay

Any one in 2019 and there is no such feature in any  Iphone even in IPhone 11😂😂

Im still waitin for this!

But you need to pay extra to activate that feature ,only 500 dollars more.

WoW!!!!!!

My phone have drone mode.When it drops drone mode activating then my phone goes back.

I don&#39;t think so

This iPhone 7 has A headphone Jack

Headphone jack? Whats that?

nah i prefer my iStove more.
Recommendation

Na they want you to break the screen so you pay for it

Lmao it’s not even a seven it’s a six

Apple 2030 : never Apple 2050: no ! Apple 2100:  we will think about it Apple 2500: nah not yet Apple 3000: fuck said not yet !! Apple 5000: okay guys this is it let&#39;s put a fucking parachute system  in the iPhone 3000s x xr Xs max pro Steve Jobs fhdh#!+)@¥@(sgs plus

Bro wtf my iPhone cracked when I pushed it off, doesn&#39;t even work😡😡😡

That’s a iPhone 6

Stark tech.

This is actually possible it would be kind easy to make

Iphone 11pro max just came out and still no parachute system

MAN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY FILE AN APPLICATION FOR THE PATENT OF THE DESIGN AND WORK..... WHO KNOWS THIS MIGHT BE TRUE IN FUTURE AND YOU WILL ALWAYS GET THE ROYALTY BONUS, I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO!!!!!!!!!!! WHO THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE GIGABIT INTERNET???? BUT WE DO HAVE..... NOBODY KNOWS THE FUTURE!!!

Imagine putting a case on

This is fake because it has a headphone jack

Lmao this is far AF 💀 apple can&#39;t add one in scrn fingerprint n this is way far adding CO2 TANK N VALVES N ALL SHIT

I am glad this happened to be true for iphone 7 , i still have it and the parachute works perfectly still

Thomas have never seen such bullshit!

Co2 tank sold separately starting at $2000

Show this to Apple

If space x and apple cooperated

Wish this was real, dropped my iPhone 7 a week ago and the screen is fucking busted as hell

Funny how the iphone 7 on this video has a headphone jack , lol.

We need this for the iPhone x and iPhone 11 🤣🤣

Rip

Tbh, it would be cool if they did this

Tried this on my iPhone 7. Gotta say apple really beats everyone in terms of durability and protection.

Thanks for reminding me how old my phone is

Watching on iphone 7

Wow!!!!

I would pay $2000 for this feature on an iphone.

Mobile companies- we have shown the most improvements in past couple of yearsRumours- hold my beer

RCS be like(only SFS bois know)

I see the YouTube algorithm is bringing us together once again

Now there is iphone 11 pro max

my ipad has airplane mode😅

Seeing iphone&#39;s prices,an iphone with parashute mode would definetely cost above 10k

this got recommended after watching the iphone 11 keynote

My phone&#39;s got submarine mode.Oh wait I just dropped it in the toilet.....

Oh really it&#39;s 2019

Anyone after Iphone 11 launch?

Watching after iPhone 11...

Lol iphone 11 pro max
Anyone from the iPhone 11 launch

Bro that’s so fake

I&#39;m from the future and this is all a lie

Its 260% real

Bye p2 😭
Anyone here after iPhone 11 launch ?

2016:wait2017:wait2018:WAIT2019: <b>rEcOmMeNd iT tO eVeRyOnE!!!</b>

Why is this in my recommendations?

Where’s my parachute?

Anyone after the Iphone 11 Stovetop? 2019!

iPhone 11 is here, still waiting for this parachute system!!

Fake

I'm sorry but I have to laugh hahahahaha
This  is an iPhone 6

Smart idea

if apple was smart enough to do this

IPHONES AREN&#39;T FRICKING CATS

Is that actually a thing

i tried thisdo i need to turn airplane mode on?

It's beautiful to dream
i phone 11 has launched till now no parachuteno headphone jack

i have a iphone 7

It has a headphone jack tho

I’m watching this on a iPhone 7 and I can confirm.

100% real

i work at at apple store its sad that some customers ask for this feture :d

iPhone 11 out no parachute still XD

Already iphone 11 here. Still does not have that function

Fake

Promise I’ll be back in 2022

Who is watching this from iphone 7.😂😂

iphone 11 just came out and almost nothing had changed

Do it in real life you f**k

YouTube recommendationYes...

Anyone else here after the IPhone 11 launch?

I would honestly pay another 100 dollars of they made a phone like this

Im pretty sure the 7 doesnt have a headphone jack

anyone after the iPhone 11 keynote.?

Aw damn good memories and I still remember that iPhone screen projector

fuck.... it dosen&#39;t work XD

When we thought it would be real

Who’s watching this on their iPhone 7? (I am)

Apple: Extra feature? Sorry we&#39;re even removing the headphone jack.

iPhone 7s don’t have headphone jacks

This would actually be a good system

Proof of iPhone glass or pixel is weak

This ain’t a iPhone 7...<b>It has a head phone jack</b>

If this was real that oxygen tank would cost $100000000000000 dollars

Its end of 2019 and we still dont have that so we pay hundreds of dollars to repair our iphones

your iphone 7 is better than mine

Dead ass when I was like 9 when this came out I went to the apple store and asked if this was real they said that they don’t know lol

What is you have phone case? 🤯

this doesnt look like it UvU

Bold of you to assume that Iphone 7 has a headphone jack :/

It would be a really cool idea

Parashute mode omg trash my phone has snake arms

Apple never do that

Fake

Our house flies after whoever sees it coming
I think this feature available in 2022

The sad thing is Apple could do that

what if i throw it off a cliff

Apple users:😎Android users:💂🏼‍♂️
Iphone 7 - parachute systemWe invented it.Throw it anywhere, anytime.

<a href="">#Clickbait</a>
why would apple do that they want their phones to break so people will buy new ones

Nice  but this is not the design

probably more expensive than the phone it self

Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is fake tyis video

Who knows, what kind of music is playing? Shazam not working(

My brother has IP 7. He will soon see what crap they are pushing on the Internet
my class friends think that was real XD

Jack 3.5 mm

Damn this concept had a space to put a Co2 tank and a headphone jack while the real iphone 7 doesn&#39;t hate a headphone jack

this is the fakest thing ever

Boo you don’t get

Is thıs true I use but ?
If it was real it would be awesome

<b>i use a walmart bag for a parachute. Problem?</b>

Why iphone xs and xs max doesn&#39;t have all these stuff? Its 2019 and iphone 7 is absolutely nothing compared to the xs and xsmax. You video makers got to be kidding me!

Fake

This type of ads have made Apple richest company in the world.

<b>TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY!!</b>

So tell me what happens if you drop it face first 🤔

Is this real ??

This is an IPhone 6

Super edit😆😆
Hey I thought that there was no headphone Jack in iPhone 7

You know it’s fake when you see that the time on the phone is <a href="">12:23</a>

OMG THERE IS A HEADPHONE JACK!THAT IS A DESIGN FLAW!CODE RED

🤣 i wonder if my IPhone XS MAX does that

Dam I wished we had this

Is there any reason?
It's amazing, but I don't need this feature because I'm confident I won't drop it. Especially if it costs more and makes the price higher.
What is it lands on it’s face

2019?

NOT AN IPHONE 7 THAT IS AN IPHONE 6s

But if the parachot fails the phone dies😕😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Hey, I'm a Turk, I won't eat these.

Fourth there isn’t enough room in a iPhone for a cO2 tank and stupid valves and nozzles. Fifth the video of the person holding the phone is a fake computer generated human.this video is flat out stupid and getting disliked

Yikes...

I&#39;m excited for the iPhone7. I&#39;m watching this on my iPhone 8+. Lmao

Wtf?!!??!!

It’s fake don’t realise this

Fake bro

Fake is fu**ing..here... 😂😂😂

Instead they decided to remove headphone jack.

Fake 😀😀

most likely the reason it does not have headphone jack is because of the CO2 tank or the whole sensor system but i higly doubt its real lmao

If it was real, Elon Musk would love it.

2018 anyone😂😂😂😂😂😂 BTW good animation😂😂😂

Fake

Do send rumours like this

Whaa parachute no this isn’t flying out of helicopter so wrong design

Best comedy ever

Hey drop it from more height

Very very very fake!!
iPhone 7 squad where you at?

Never happening

And WHY isn&#39;t Apple telling us this?

Why am I watching this in 2018?

That&#39;s iPhone 6

how about u just make the phone fly

Hehe never wish apple to make a mobile with innovative SPECS because the company makes mobiles for the apple logo

XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Nice joke atleast make me laugh..xd)Like if u laughed too😂

I saw the video in 2k12......And i think its a real iphone 7 now 2k18 iphone 10x max relesed...And how many of you seen this video in 2k12....??

“parachute system”
Fakeee

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Not an iPhone fan but that could be good for phones that way it would not break

Hahahahahahaha

I HAVE IPHONE XS MAX AND PARACHUTE MODE NEVER EXIST...

THE PHONE FARTED OUT LOUD

Nice fake xd

Creativity is good this is future technology.

You think Apple would ever do something useful? Of course not. When you break the phone you have to repair it, so Apple makes money 🤑.

Salute you for great design of iphone

,not iPhone 7

What if it fell to your face = face covered with co2

I try on my iphone 7 but it did not work the parachute

Wow it still has a headphone jack

Im only watching these kind of video to laugh how dumb apple users can be!😂👌😏

This would be cool but I bet it will be a thing in the future

my dad need that

Refill of co2 gas only 100 dollars each

I remember watching this when it came out and thinking ‘woah that’s so cool’ and here Iam 3 years later watching this on my iPhone 7...

Watching on my broken i7+

I guess this is iron mans phone 😂😂

Crazy video I laughed so much

Omg they added the headphone jack again.

Pretty soon you&#39;ll be able to fly your iPhone.

Next time when they make new phone, it should have a feature that whenever we dropt it accidentally it shouldn&#39;t just land safely on the floor but also fly back to our pocket all by itself. Waiting for that model

My phone has been face planted twice but nothing happened and it also is an iPhone 7

That’s a six you dingwit it has a headphone jack

Android is probably jealous after watching this..

Fake

And my name is Kostas 😒

Make more videos

Lirs

instead of using CO2  why don&#39;t they make a rechargeable electric turboprop one

Wow.

Fake

lol

This video is for Tony Stark

You should work for Apple.

Um that’s a iPhone 6

luckily my ipad has a shock proof case so if it falls it will not break or get mest up in the system also if it does fall head first the screen will never hit because on the sides are also covered by the case all that is not blocked is the screen front camera back camera and home button. also if the i pad does fall head first on the ground the the sides are covered by the case and the case is on a higher level so it will never crack because the screen cant touch the floor because of the case. 10/10 ipad mini case i have. its great and my ipad will never break and never did. the case is a waterproof material but its open at the back probably to let the ipad breath but when it falls it closes because its on the ground and the force of just sitting there closes it because the ipad is heavy and it will force it to close its because at the back its a little loose so it opens up and plus there are too many reason it wont let water out so yeah its like a water trap the case traps liquids inside because of the shape of the case. now i would like a water proof case when i go to places where it could get wet and my case for always (but without a big chance of my ipad getting wet).  i should stop here  thats alot of words.

That&#39;s called jetpack mode 😂😂😂😂
How much is this?

Watching this on my iPhone 7

you can clearly see that it&#39;s fake

Did you actually put effort in this animation ?

you can see its animated :/

Wow wish that was real

Fake fake....

You saw the hands right? IT WAS ANIMATED

Never gonna happen , even if the iPhone 11 comes out it will never happen

what if it falls backwards😂

You can see it&#39;s animation

Im using an iphone 7 now and it dont looks like that thing

Awansome !

Jokes on u the iphone 7 doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack

What happen if iphone fall by front face

They would notTo do that because they want money for fixing broken screens lol

I remember when I watched this in 2015

😂😂😂

😂😂😂🙄

This is just a concept .. Co2 Lol

HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAH

If Made by Takata...welllll....ADIOS!!!!

What about if parachutes in your pocket?😂

Just came to dislike.I am 1000% sure that they will not add this feature, even if they could. Because if iPhone have this feature the customers won&#39;t get their phone broken and so they don&#39;t even need to pay for Apple for the maintenance or to buy a new iPhone, that will be a huge loss the company. Because they don&#39;t care about their customers, they only care about customers money.

to be honest apple wants you to break yo phone

Scam

y would apple stop the phone from breaking if the person would buy a new one afger

FAKE

co2 gas recharging 😂

Android users don&#39;t need this, atleast our phones are stringer than stupid iphones breaking

Instead of installing a parachute system, just design a more durability iphone...more cheaper

U all Are Fackers!

These already are expensive enough, implementing that would run them up to more than 1,000 dollars.

I know there are only foreigners here but that's ok, Apple and no other brand will never do this, this would take away a lot of the brands' money because the cell phone will never break and therefore it won't look for repairs, that's logic

music

buuuull sheet
wow an iphone that farts

very smart

It&#39;s a good idea for apple :)

Ha ha ha ha
more false than the Lehman Brothers&#39; balance

Ver Isaas
This is bullshit, Apple will never do that kinda of stuff with three phones

ip was
THE BEST PHONE EVER!!!!

wtf was that?? what if iPhone is dropped with its screen facing the ground!! totally shit concept.

This is so unrealistic

kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk que mentira
is faker

even man is a work, not just the phone!!!
why CO2 it can be just air and ligting port is hitting the co2 tank

mm it will come soon. apple says

his editing is awesome

Ok its so obvious the little air tank in the phone is fake but I belive that that&#39;s probably the look of the phone its probably going to be ( plz no hate Im just telling my opinion)

Fake 😝😅😅😅😅
jdnd
And what if it lands face down

The eagle has landed

Omg you fucking idiots, just turn airplane mode on...

wow

It is fake

LOL LOL HAHA

I think it&#39;s nonsense

Scroll down to see how many people can&#39;t accept creativity and think bold, probably the reason they aren&#39;t the designers of these products or even these videos

how would the phone know the difference between the floor and your pocket

But can someone make this for real

awesome

Yeeeeeees and the iPhone 7 can make the breakfast and it&#39;s imposible destroy it and he can fly and he can have childs :vok no XD(sorry for my english i&#39;m castilian spanish)

Anything
People would drop their phones on PURPOSE just to see a moon landing take place in their home!

In my opinion apple would never do this yes it is cool and efficient but is it really needed that much think about how much you drop your phone and think about how much you use your phone it&#39;s most likely you use your phone more than you drop it would you really want to spend money on a case and co2 gas or just a case I would just spend money on a case so I don&#39;t have to log co2 gas around with me everyday

rlly thats not coming and if its thats about going about 2000 euros

😂

Nice fake imagination

iPhone 7 with parachute system is wish then every people who try to break the phone will quit they&#39;re channels

hahahaha

omg no way haahahahahahahhahahahahah

What if you overload it?<b>drop phone</b> oh shi <b>phone fly though the ceiling like a rocket</b> ...oh

If he doesn't fall on his face instead

Widescreen, instant recharge, parachute system... How&#39;s Apple gonna fit all this into one phone???

No need to fill with carbon bro. The IPhone can just heat up and create carbon that way.

What&#39;s the song?

Lmaooo this is actually a good idea

Clearly not a iphone 7 because Apple it&#39;s self said it will not be ANY HEAD PHONE PORT. other wise great vid. The editing is great!

fake

Wow

hahaha nice joke a phone will now float in air! !!!!!!

all fake just look it clearly

That is so cool 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 woow
que? &#39;-&#39;

Just a few mods away from an iGrenade

Les say this idea takes off, what if I replace the CO2 with an explosive substance? Or modify the tank with a larger capacity to fit more gas and get a bigger boom? Will iPhones then be banned from airports and other places? What&#39;s going to happen to all that pressurised gas when my phone gets warm from playing a game?

wow

I said oh my god 😈😈😈😈
I phone can&#39;t make touch phones like samsung and moto

Xaxaxaxa

Go to an Apple Store and you will be told before even explaining everything that your smartphone which is 2 months old has taken on water and that without warranty from the Apple store (150 euros per year) you will have to pay 300 euros to to exchange. Against a new one. that's what's called being taken for a fool. take out the guarantee and you pay 90 euros excess instead of the 300 euros requested if you don't have the Apple card guaranteed.apple is a real cash cow for the many bohemian geeks who swear like a star kid that Apple will change their lives
😂😂😂😂😂

ffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Totaly legi m8

It even gave my heart a squeeze. er He Falling💔😂
apple working with british airways!

the only reason I would ever buy this ridiculous fantasy of an 8th-grade nerd, is if I was going to continuously chuck my phone on the ground just to watch it do the dumbest thing ever and fart back up.

Breaking new hover boards are catching fire and blowing. Now IPhones are at risk of blowing up

Ya, right

this just gave me cancer =/

Great duty.
This is all fantasy
haha they dream
And they will sell the CO2 tank for 100$/tank..

I have a doubt regarding this system.if the phone falls down facing the screen to the floor then how this system works.

Can anyone tell me the title of the song of this video ? Thank you.

:D epic shit mini c4 BOOOOOOM    the new weapon for jihad soliders

Apple are jealous because Samsung make better phones.

BAHXAHXBAHXABXA , the funiest iPhone concept ive ever seen LOL.. bullshit

FAKE

speedy mustafa :D What did you throw? I threw an iPhone 7 at them but it didn't hit :))
its reaiillly kidding me

Wait is that what a case is for instead of a parachute system ? 😂right?

it&#39;ll be class if we put oxogen into phones and didn&#39;t have to charge it,

the world only wishes apple could make suck amazing technology

Scru that parachute system we want batteries that survies longer

you have a lot of imagination

Hahahaha

God, what a load of shit!
Mexicoooo ~(＾◇^)/
It&#39;s true?

Omg so real

sure

These guys must be crazy 😃
This is not right video this is fake

better than a stand up comedy :&#39;Ddd

It&#39;s fake

dat would be cool tho

But woooowww I like Iphone 7 beter!:D
Realy is it works with parachute.Thats inposseble!

that feature would be very cool and helpful but i think it would be too expensive. great concept tho like thumb up

I know this is fake but what if it falls to the side?

Damn he need some milk

Where do you get all these crazy ideas sonitdac?

Wouldn&#39;t this thicken the phone?

bullshit! This will (may) never happen)
first

More fake than your mum!!!

fakest iphone what i ever see for real CO2 tank Xd come for real and apple dont have iphone7

fake

Gooooooooooddddddd

so a iron man iphone
I want it😍
What if it doesn&#39;t land on its back

fake...???

Do you even know what a parachute looks like?

rsrsrsrsrsrskkkkkkkkm

lol

what is this shit

LMAO I LOLED SO HARD WHEN IT STARTED FARTING

How do you know that&#39;s the iPhone 7

wtf this is so fake

what a lie dude
You can dream if you want...
He's about to fuck us soon
LIKE ME FOR NO REASON ☺!
fake

very very super smart I phone

my Phone can fly i put it on airplanemode and then i Let it Fall try it for your self it workshop.

Super lie
BULLSHIT!!!

azabiiiii

I want !!!!
Far out that is one heck of a good idea but knowing Apple I don&#39;t think they&#39;re up to that mabey when the iPhone 20 comes out they might do it but you might need bigger co2 tanks Coz look how big the iPhone 6s Plus is, and the iPhone twenty wil probs be the size of a bus!

Here we go a new CO2 emitting device.

I hope they added a hoverboard app

cool but I think this style would be better for some military package dro off js even thoe they have something similar js

I'm Rihanna too
IS THIS REAL?!?!?

I was just missing this lol
It is impossible so fast and so hard to fall air motors are activated to cushion such a relatively heavy device
impossible

When you put airplane mode...

Fake

Hahaha harrier jump jet ........
This is the shittiest and shittiest video I have ever watched. It would suit iPhone anyway 😃😃😃😃
crazy
iPhone 7 is very good bro
OMG

This real ?

also that cant be the 7 unless they lied about it not having a headphone jack

i&#39;m not sure about this...a co2 tank too fucking close to the batery. ..It maybe become a pocket-bomb if it come too hot.

I&#39;m an android user switching to Apple, and I&#39;m confused. So Apple phones can fly now?

what if it falls on the other side and right before it hits it&#39;s screen the phone boosts and then it throws it&#39;s self towards                           the ground like a suicidal phone

If only people read the descriptions, they would know this is a CONCEPT

funny as fuck!!! thanks for the  laugh...

OMG  :))

Dedededdedeededededeoooaoaoaoaooaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoadendenderererededededededededededeeeddeededededed

New iPhone 7

Mehmet, ü
wtf

Bro very good
Curse the father of lies
how apple could think of things like that(and the widescreen), but can&#39;t do a good battery.and by the way, it&#39;s another way to burn your money with co2 gaz.

How long until the co2 tank explodes equaling buying another phone

NYC animation....

fake

huh?
Prototype for the SE version from Tony Stark..

Impossible

waaw

Seriously? Please:\
That is so cool

song????!

Wouldn&#39;t wanna be around an iPhone when they fart they have no windows

what      the        fuck      is     happening    to        life

?

bullshit
Fake

awesome idea :D although &quot;parachute&quot; isn&#39;t really a suitable term. You should invent an actual parachute function as well. whereas in practice, a simple bumper is probaby the best solution^^

But don't believe it, even the hand over there is not real.
jajjaajaajjaaj😆😆😆😆😆😁😁😁😁
utterly stupid feature

Its real

wow when mine fell I couldn't believe it he's awesome
Shredder iPhone version Iron Man
Yes now I can travel to different countries with this phone!

That&#39;s retarted

Wow I can&#39;t believe it !! Amazing 😱

kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Good idea. But I&#39;m not sure there&#39;d be enough space for it inside the device because of all the tech and gearing in it. Maybe making a case that has the device would be sufficient enough.

parchute system ahahaha lie more to me

Fake

good  iphone 6 plus
If it falls on your face you're screwed
cool

Don&#39;t like this comment

Drop test pass 💯
iphone 14

Keep dreaming, who made this was Iron Man?
FAKE

keep it up!

lol you thought you were in Iron Man lol
Honestly I don&#39;t understand why you guys still bother making animation on iphone&#39;s concepts.After almost a decade the latest iphone is pretty much the same as the very first one. All that they&#39;ve introduced was a stupid button that scans your fingerprints, a front camera and slightly better specs every time comes a new model and that&#39;s it. It was a phone for dummies in 2007 and it still is. So why the fuck bother to give to these pieces of crap unreal animation like a fucking Co2 tank that prevents it from smashing on the ground when fucking apple all that wants is to sell this very expensive piece of crap to you and then rip you off again when it comes to repair it charging 3 times what a workshop would normally charge to perform any kind of repair. Grow up you stupid idiots, has been 10 years now.

OMG

BIG FAKE!!!

Apple 
Aaaaaappppppllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeee

I thought phones would get smaller but no they now breathe

maybe we should stop weed
Hahahah dear
Hahahahahha

Shit.

Its a good trailer but why will you put so much in something that you created. or think.

this is crazy!! wow

Song?

Wow iphone now can fart in mid air what if I drop it in the middle of the screen can it also manage to do that or what if I drop it in the 3rd floor in the building can it manage to survive like that... stupid question right.

u can tell that the lady&#39;s hand is cartoon and is fake so that proves this is fake

lol. not only would you have to charge the battery, but also the co2 cart. THAT THING WOULD NEED TO BE MASSIVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

OmGosh is this real!?

When the iPhone fell I almost died😂
Epic idea! However do you think Steve Jobs would approve?

kkkk boa

This is such a stupid concept

iPhone crap is fierce
lol

Where is the parachute ? !

that&#39;s a liar

because they can&#39;t make it shatter-proof

You know how dumb that is

fake

100% none of these things and the phone is just like the iphone 6 maybe its just bigger ot thinner

LIE

Thalys si cool

That&#39;s a freaking Samsung

couldnt you just breath into the hole to fill the carbon dioxide tank ??/

suscripto

i was vanished

Now just do that with a macbook...

Shit...... Load of shit

if I pull my hand down too fast to put the phone in my pocket that&#39;s not going to make the phone think it&#39;s falling and shoot the damn thing up against the ceiling

que fake kkk

such real

See you ;)
you&#39;re dumb
that is a animation

is that real or not real?

if we put it face down what will happen the glass will break

what if my phone falls facing downward? its gonna accelerate the fall nothing else.

This comment section is so toxic

So fake it is going to be so thin that that can&#39;t even fit a battery in the phone how are that going to put rokets in there

Who is br like
PSH that&#39;s not happening

What are you doing with your life making fake ass YouTube vids

NO FUCKING WAY

Still not all iPhones land flat

Such a lie like duhhh

How did the iPhone turn into iron man

Yeah in a car what goes 140 then the phone releases the co2

Dese r fake videos...Dont know who makes these...

It&#39;s great

this clip made me laugh we can expect this in 2116

THE FUTURE IS NOW! iPhones now cost $1000 more and require co2 which I&#39;m pretty sure very one has!

Kml it&#39;s not possible yet but why to think outside the box

lol

Fake

But what will happen to the phone if it lands on the screen?

If you rase your iphone it will do that

lol

Lol nice idea. If only Apple is capable of this.

Fake

too bad Android will have it first and Apple will have it 2 years or more later, as with all new technologies and features

No offense but I sorta doubt this I mean it would be cool and all but really

this would blow up the phone.

spare me

They said in 2016 anything is possible so maybe it could happen!!!!!!!

so fake

you don't even believe it
Who will put Co2 in hes phone xD

First off all that is a iPhone 6 and you put some things in the video to make like a (kof)kof I phone 7

In 2025 :v

Would be better if they install blades as a chopper! I would use it to shoot videos as a drone :D

almost
now drop it on its face

WHAT GAS RECHARGING!?!?!?!??! This is just ridiculous..

Is it smart to buy iphone 6s now or should i wait for september to get iphone 7 ?

What if it fell face front? Money will be wasted. And it isnt even a parachute.

falso

fake

Fake

Stop the fake vids

No worries if this true

but what if the iPhone falls with the screen facing down??
Yea like never well actually nevermind

For sale Number +7(999)003-01-01150$=10,000r
These are really good ideas!

All the I phone 7 are different

FAKE

THIS IS NOT A PARACHUTE!!!

Legit asf

Love this idea. Amazing creativity !!!

I love Iphone

WOOOOOOOOOWWW !!!!! BEAUTIFUL futur

What the hell you guys are good editors!

I dont think this is possible.

lol

Hello Muhammad Maher
sorry, hoverboards dont exist
This is for the iPhone 25 😂

Stop makeing fake video, what&#39;s next? iPhone 8?

I don't believe
great animation

Where are the Brazilians?

my eyes is bleeding, is this maded by Iron Man

No ahahahahhahaha, but really, we're joking
It&#39;s not real

u can make concepts not an iphone :p

NO IS FAKE IS FOR SUBSCRIBE I DONT LIKE FAKE

i hope apple make this

If all of your video&#39;s about iPhone 7 would be true , it would easily Costs 2000 or 3000 dollars

that is impossible, but if possible then no need charge, there is a suck up system.

Thats so fake

The arm and the clothes and finally the phone. Looks like that it&#39;s made of clay

fake

seems legit
Apple have gone fucking mad. they are obsessed with making iphones so thin as if the 6 wasn&#39;t already thin enough. Making phones so thin ruins the feel it almost feels you want to squash the thing because its so thin. People want thicker phones with that can have more longer lasting batterys yet Apple are so stupid they think everyone wants thin assed phones. The thickness of the 5s was perfect and was so pleasing in the hand you felt as if you were holding a premium device unlike the ugly iPhone 6 which feels so awkward. Apple have lost the plot completely and Jobs would be so pissed off with their designs now.

Just make a tougher phone.....................................

like the airports are going to let people in planes with co2 cartarages in thier pockets... what a dumb concept... really good animation, ill give you that

It's like Apollo 5 mobile version hahahahaha waste of time.....
is this real?? its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Android phones can take falls and still be fine

Let&#39;s give Apple ideas but dude awesome idea

XD man you watch tooooo much star wars

If only this existed...

wtf

damm

We've been screwed! Let's separate!
Is that real

WoW, i never knew apple will start letting iphones fart too

apple should make something useful for my work...

this is a lot of shit but it looks amazing

while im jumping on a trampoline my phone blows my pants down?

Is not really ^^

it funny how fake this is

ps I already have it
not exactly,

holy shit now I can use it as a FIRE EXTINGUISHER damn Daniel 😂😂😂

That would contribute to global warming.. :/

I have a better idea ... just dont drop it and you will save like 100€.

Apple Parachute air cannister now available for only $9999999999999 each

i wish this was real

then it would be worth the price

Haha I wish
Wow dude. Just no. Stop. There is no way. Just dont.

1. this isnt even possible in such a small phone 2. apple wouldnt do this because screen repairs make them money

If this was a thing I would be dropping my phone 24/7

is it true

You can tell the hand is animated

What if it lands screen first? And there will be a problem with people wanting to drop their iPhone so not sure what the warranties will do about it

SO FUKING FAKE

co2 gas ? nigga a phone is a phone , but not a transformer

That is an impossible feature to appear in an iPhone

This is about the most least likely thing I&#39;ve seen yet.

this video is FAKE

It could actually be possible for Apple to implement this into their new phone.

that&#39;s not the iPhone 7 cuz there&#39;s a picture online with release date

Does this exist

Now techrax can&#39;t do anymore drop tests :D

Oke this is just fucking fake im sorry man, dislike

Who show this BEfore the iPhone 4

Nice Photo Shop

im using iphone but are you kidding me what is this shit

wow 😀

Its funny how apple funboys are retardet and do they beleve it.

thats the dumbest thing ever wtf did i judt watch

Omg so damn unrealistic and fake!!!!

That is cool, but not going to happen anytime soon

fake*

fakr

Not happening.

Companies don&#39;t want to sell durable products, because people won&#39;t buy new ones then

Imagine the liability!  But pretty cool!

If my shuttle to the moon crashes, at least my phone will survIve......

That&#39;s sick
yeah totally real

wtf

Then you have to recharge the CO2 all the time, and it&#39;s not free...

If Only

no just fucking no

FACEPALM!

waw

fake asffff xD apple hasnt even released a homebutton on the iphone that responds to pressure, they just came out with a phone that responds to pressure on the screen. idk if this is a joke but yea

Where is the parachute ??

i have seen a lot of stupid iphone 7 theories, but this is probably the stupidest

Apple said there won&#39;t be ibend in iPhone 7 plus but ibend was cool in iPhone 6 Plus u could just switch between a flat screen or bending it xD btw I have an iPhone but it&#39;s not bent yet

So, what will happen when you run out of CO2?

Its fake

Our genoration is so fucked up :D

Buhahahahahahaha
Fake

would be pretty useful if it was real but would be fucking expensive

It actually doesn&#39;t work like that

this is so dumb

Shrirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I&#39;ve seen parachute drotests using drones but this is New to me

So what if the phone falls front facing

How did you make this?

If that shit works im buying it.

It&#39;s crazy xD but maybe one day

They sucked on this one, hahaha.
fake fake

4000 dislike=4000 Android user
asome

nice joke
SUUUURE x&#39;Dim fking dead!
And Emilia also believes it hahaha what a wretch
nice idea

Hahaha

like this will ever happen lol

so with a iPhone 7 I can literally fly to Mars????

Cool Idea but imagine the price

Lol guys,in this vid ,they have shown that parachute system works WHEN THE PHONE FALLS IN ITS BACK,NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PHONE DROPS ON THE SCREEN😂😂😂😂😂😂

Nice teaser,not very practical. but eh,who cares. They always buy them.

It is true the dislike button works

orr..they could just make a more durable phone...just a thought

More fake than a transvestite tit xD
what happens if its about to faceplant

yep cuz im just gonna have to go to the store and explain why im buying co2 gas for my iphone

This is hilarious.  Great videos.

nice

YES PLS

I want <a href="">#Brazil</a>
NO WAY

that&#39;s really stupid.that small of a tank wouldn&#39;t give enough pressure

If this would be the real the iphone 7.... This is going to be so coool

I&#39;ll wait until it gives me a better shave!

These infidels did it, they will do it again ewqjkjklrjskdltewrt
False

I can fill my ass wit CO&#39;2 and jump off from 3rd floor

it&#39;s amazaing

that system there my friend video creator is called retro rocket retardation system it&#39;s used during the time of  reentry of space vehicles specially soyuz . Not parachute system. at least name that shit caption correctly.:P:&#39;D

Oohhh Its a concpt idea

When i read title &quot;Parachute System&quot; I expected parachute come out of speakers...but he lies! :&quot;(

You&#39;d need more force from the pressure valve and therefore a larger cylinder to resist the weight of the phone prior to impact, otherwise it would be a measly gimmick.. Where would you hide the bigger cylinder? There&#39;s no space on the current iPhone size, and we all know sizes are being reduced incrementally.

it&#39;s animation

:))))))))))) it s nog real

Fake

so fake jesus
fuck you plz
wow.....unbelievable Apple at its best

the fucking hand was animated wtf

Before the video ends. That guy just recharge the CO2 tank and then he drops it. What a waste of money!

My iphone falls at least 20  times a day. Refilling it with co2 every time would be a pain in the ass.

this guy is the best

MENTIRAAAAAAAAAAAA ES MAS FALSO QUE MI MIERDA

If the iPhone falls, is Aécio responsible?
it would cost so much space money and battery life its a funny joke

I have iPhone 5S touch focus for taking photos, it works, but slow.  NO touch focus when capturing videos.I have iPhone 6S Plus touch focus not work.  NO touch focus when capturing videos.How about iPhone 7 touch focus for photos and videos?Samsung Galaxy S7 touch focus works very fast for taking photos and capturing videos.  It&#39;s the pro phone.

impossible

Yea, this is not a bad idea but if you are like TechRax, it will explode in each video

MDS

what about if it screen lands that shit wont work

fake

i think its fake

FAKE

THE SYSTEM PROBABLY COST LIKE A LOT, LIKE ALMOST ENOUGH TO FIX YOUR PHONE TEN TIMES. PLUS IF YOU FILL YOUR WHOLE PHONE WITH AIR, IT&#39;S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO BREAK THE FALL, AND IF YOU PRESSURIZE THE AIR TO MUCH, IT&#39;S GONNA BURST YOUR PHONE. DUMBEST IDEA EVER...

its fake

No

it is all fake 😖

Sorry man, but they going to put another speaker where you parachute system will be..

i love iphone
How much do you wanna bet apple watches these videos for ideas

lindo

Too bad it&#39;s just an animation :)

nice concept but the refueling thing is lame

Nice parachute joke 👻

and what if it falls screen facing towards the floor?

These people need to give this guy a job...

Do you guys know if you want real truth go to apple YouTube page instead. Its a idea from a fan.

I wish that would happen someday with apple

2025 it will happen.

This IS So FAKE

its fake as u can see its animated

Does the iPhone company know about this?
This would make for a great April fools prank

good idea

what if I jump off something with the phone in my pocket.

The idea is very good
fake

lol

if you use the lighter while it is leaking gas ... Can be a little jetpack ?! 🚀

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s real

so fake I could kill myself,but cool

Seriously the creator needs to really make launch trailers for APPLE Inc.  (Y)

Wish this was real though.

unnecessary
AHAHAH

Music ???

nice dream
It&#39;s all bogus

cool
best fake

it&#39;s physically impossible, it contradicts Murphy&#39;s laws ;-)

Thank you, I haven&#39;t laughed so much in ages, and your videos are just brilliantly funny!

Believe or not. Our grandmothers would probably ...... :-) ...
when will come this phone to market

so what happens if it falls on the screen?

its a lie

so if you&#39;re in a car or jogging, yr phone will fly away?

Haha good fake apple -_-

Lies

my phone can now be a personal airplane :)

im watching this and this guy has exactly 75,000 subs not any more!

Shows iPhone users are retarded :p  Droid FTW

ajajajajjsjsjsj
ajajajajjsjsjsj
Fake

And I know that because I have one already because Apple sent me one.

That&#39;s such a stupid trick. This is fake. It doesn&#39;t have a parachute.

Wow great idea :D

this is fake

wow, human imaginations...

if only that were real

iPhone iPhone

Such Bullshit

why CO2 use O2. We can also use it as gas mask when climbing mountain. It would also act as a Pump to asthma patients

Hahahahahahaha

Fake👎🏿
Dreams.

Good idea👍
Nice animation but u show us alot of gadgets in iPhone 7 and i didnt think this will be in it

Do not you say
I was the first to think of this. I seriously thought of something like this years ago😀
cool maybe it will also come with a laser beam that will scratch my ass from space

My eggs
great idea !!
or you can actually make iphones tougher. HAHAHHAAHAHH no, just buy an android

the dude at the end has 3 fingers XD

Did you believe?
Genius!!!!!!
Cartoon much
fake...

is it real?

So a lie
lol, kkk

if only xD

they had to make this because they broke all of the time because they suck <a href="">#team</a> samsung

I wish

Not to hurt anyones imagination but! Just telling u that even if there was a parachute thingy it will only cover up the back which is the least important part u showed that the parachute it coming out of the back and not the front so u should think about it more before uploading these kinds of videos -3-

and if the cell. screen fall? &quot;/
I love apple. But this would be cooler if this was what they were doing

Shut up and take my money

Nice idea

Airbag would be logic solution :)

and if that ever happen i will probably drop my phone for fun

what editing system did you use to make the part were the guy drops the phone

that will never happen

This literally made me laugh out loud

It's true?
That is fart System

Fucking fake

fuck it from there
Fake

totally fake its said that iphone 7 will not have headphone jack but there will be wirelesss headphne in the box and beats will provide apple the wireless headphone

this will so happen I MEAN A FLYING IPHONE. SO. GONNA. HAPPEN.

Apple won&#39;t do anything real to the iPhone 7, they will just make it larger and more durable &quot;cough cough not cough cough&quot;

That&#39;s the dumbest idea i&#39;ve ever seen

That would be AWESOME! :D

This would be amazing!...For 2074

unreal

fuck its not true

Hahaha

Your videos are awsome,don&#39;t listen to the others.

Hahahaha 😂

This is fucking gayyy 😂😂😂😂

that&#39;s the most stupid video I ever saw

what if its facing the other way?

iplane

what if it falls on it&#39;s face? i see no propellers in the front.

Who belives in this is really fucking stupid.

I DOUBT IT

and I think I need flexible phone because my phone in my jean pocket is stiff enough to bother me crouching.

or when the stranger touched the phone, the flow of current seeped into the body will be helpful not to be stolen.

oh it is good idea once we drop the phone, if it  automatically emits air against the ground to prevent from shattering, the screen will be protected effectively.

BC!!!!!!!

omg

i hate these concept vids because there so creative and better than the actual iphone

FAKE !!!!!!! and GAY

I NEED THAT PHONE ALL MINE ARE BROKEN OR CRACKED

I actually always thought about that

So fuxking fake.
What are you talking about, asshole, these are all special effects
Useless feature

AMAZING 😂

Really nigga?

This is just stupid....

Wow😍😍
thats the dumbest thing i have ever seen, pls stop making/uploading videos

Lol, y don&#39;t u just buy a case like ummm... if u like protection Lunatik cases? If u don&#39;t like big cases then buy a normal case! and if apple would do this shit id never buy that thing, cmon :D

Hours. Show us something and we will wait. Tell me tomorrow, attach it to the car and it will auto drive Traffic &amp; Will avoid car. even a little
if believe in it  that means you&#39;re stupid and bump

fake

looks a bit to hard for apple to make a parachute  system

good

soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooFAKE JK JK JK

samsung is the best fuck the rest :D

just make a durible phone made from polycarbonit plastic like the old samsung phones note 3 for example its durrable and not made of shitty aluminum

That would have to be a big phone for that to work right

he is very big
Techrax in the other hand...

if phone down towards screen then what u fucking fools

Nice but it wouldn&#39;t fly with Apple, due to no longer making money off cracked screens and broken lcds.

this is a game

would be best toy for babies though :-D

For what?

wtf i just watch......?

This iPhone is fine
Fake

...so the iphone basically has 3DMG

FAKE

it&#39;s not iphone 7 u bitch... its iSuit 7

Can&#39;t stop watchibg thus hilarious vid

so many logic errors, I can&#39;t even fit them all in a single twitter post

Stupid idea

We dont need space ships anymore to go to mars now

Absolutely hilarious :D

Oh my god this channel is the best fake iphone teaser maker wow <b>-</b>

Galileo would have used this from the leaning tower of Pisa

Will it jump back into my hands?

I already want to have it
NO CAMEL'S HOLE!
i love how this is never gonna happen

Yea this will never happen

lol that&#39;s just a bit too small tank

hahaha awsome

fake

haha but that is a cool idea thou

if its boom ?? :))))

WOW

People know that the whole clip is animated including the human hand right? Give some appreciation for his hard work in animating cool concepts btw

wtf

This is actually a solid concept, it&#39;s an interesting idea but it just won&#39;t work. I only say this because those tubes are not nearly big enough to get powerful enough airflow, it would be like trying to hold up a frying pan with a compressed air can. Good idea and good animation though, keep working!

Really interesting concept

so fucking stupid

When you see that your smartphone is closer to be iron man than being phone is time to go to bed

what is Mouzon called?
Super iphone 7
this should actually be a thing XD

This is the most retarded video I&#39;ve ever seen.

thus phone won&#39;t Have headphone jack... it couldn&#39;t fit because of this co2 jack.

But iPhone 7 isnt gonna have a headphone jack

Brad
So fake

if the falls on the front on screen then whats the benifits of this parashute..............................

So let's bite Mtvani's mother too😂😂😂
...iPhone10 - &quot;Rocket System&quot;!!!   You can fly to the Moon?!

Heloou

this is the method for iphone 7
What if it lands face down??? Like they always do

YouTube channels that do drop tests would have to quit YouTube forever

That&#39;s all in the computer.

omg

that&#39;s pretty fucking stupid.

f*uck, is this real?

it says concept meaning its an idea that they could use

I&#39;m gonna buy this phone when it comes out

When it goes on sale? please can you answer me quickly
ayy I see that Logic - T.I.T.S album on your phone! <a href="">#RattPack</a>

His vision

How is that safe your caring gas basically with you you have to put the gas in it to wow bro wow

FAKE

do you really expect the next iPhone to have any cool features? it&#39;s literally going to be the exact same thing as the 6S, maybe with a little gimmick that&#39;s costs $900

You make really interesting videos. I would be very happy if you would take a look at my channel ;)
Shit iPhone 7 is so awesome
so this was clearly made by someone who never saw the inside of an iphone: there is not space for such a tank and when so small it wouldn&#39;t be able to do something like that.

?

A spacecraft on the spot
I have always been Samusng but this time Apple impressed me, a very good idea
what if it falls on the other side? -.-

made me laugh samk yhs banda 6s camed lolo
dont expect too much of the iphone 7 what was the big change from 5-6 in value?

ayy lmao
What a piece of bullshit
Well done--except for the music.

They say i could become anything, so i became a f*cking parachute

Wtf it&#39;s not Real

Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Yeah Seems legit.
the iPhone 6 is not true that it already folds, you have to go there to do it
Cool!!But ... FAKE

I know it&#39;s a bit too much for a phone but could this be possible?

this is the future

sooooooooooooooooooooooo F A K E

kkkkkkkk

If you think this is real you&#39;re a fucking idiot.

really niggggggaaa????

the so fuckin bullshit!!!😂

this is stupid

awesome idea ! apple is just next levelbut i think it is ridiculous becuase its fake

people actually believe that air pressure can stop a heavy phone from that kind of drop.

this is good stuff. I showed my 6 yr old this and he is amazed at this spaceship landing phone.good one guys now I&#39;ve gotta either build this shit or find it cause he wants it for his bday.

Mhm go on...
lol nope

sadly thats is an iphone 6

your a real dumbass huh?
Why da fuck u lying
fake

This is more unrealistic than Donald Trump becoming president.

This will need a 0ms response in order to make it useful

first of all this is fake they are not putting this in the iPhone 7 and apple is not even started on the iPhone 7

No

No. No. No. And screw that music too

is this real?

Wtf is this

I dont think apple would add this but if you make this into a case it would be cool even do its probably inpossible

This make it even harder u have to refill the CO2

will this actually be implemented in the iPhone7?that would be crazyyy

nice samsung galaxy man
you need a real footage with a prototype! then i can prove its real i dont trust you right now...

420 noscope...

I'm speechless
no iphone 7 wil exist if it does it wont have compresed air

Wow we do have smart dumb ppl

But what if it land on the screen

Good luck getting that through airport security. &quot;Oh I&#39;ll just put on airplane mode.&quot; <b>compressed gas flies out of ur phone</b>

All of your videos are completely ridiculous

This option very nice. Say <a href="">#iphonecrashtest7no</a>

sp

WTF?????

Give a track!!!
99999999% fack

We all know this is not a feature of iPhone 7...... Cuz cook only pursuit PROFIT.

I really thought this thing was equipped with a legit parachute, so that when it falls down,  a huge piece of balloon shaped cloth appears.

iPhone7 doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack its a fake video

What happens if I drop my phone with the screen face down, that happens most of the time

Boy

Cool concept but it&#39;s not 9016

Bullshit Apple is too lazy

this is wavy

Wow what idiot went through all this trouble to make this video?

instant recharge , parachute system. why not put on a missile  launcher and shotgun in case of a war. Or  even a x-ray  camera for when you break a bone. A med kit or medical station built in? WTF???????????

Your animation has gotten a lot better

Is the hand real??
yeahh sure
That would literally be the best thing ever shame it&#39;s not real tho

WOW * - * PERFECT PHONE!! &lt;3

wow

Accidentally drops iphone 7 <b>flips</b> lands on sceen from 5m <b>explodes</b> damnit!

how about a time machine while we&#39;re at it.

now i can use my phone as hover board

F-A-K-E
i was expecting parachutes....not thrusters.

My dad&#39;s girlfriend was convinced that this is real...

wow☺💔
i phone 7 dident even comeout yet so this is a lie

This was so cheesy i could smell it....

If only that was real nigga

can you guys not see that this is animated

Just put a frikkin case on it

is this real or fake

This maybe is true! Who knows?

,

That&#39;s not real

WTF?

FAKE

if it fell on the screen

ParaPhone I wish that was real

Why not just build the phone from stronger material? Instead of using up space for a CO2 chamber esp when they&#39;re fighting for ever mm of space and cramming things in as much as possible? Cool concept, no company would ever adopt it tho.

that&#39;s cool

Its funny how FAKE this is

I think that this will never happen because Apple and Samsung doesn&#39;t do anything other than copying and pasting their previous phone models and releasing them as newer models with tiny improvements

Fake

They will never create such things because of $$$Fuck you, you have to buy a new one :)

IT HAS BEEN LEAKED THAT THE NEXT ROVER LANDING ON MARS IS THE IPHONE 7!! WE NEED ALL THE FUNDING RESEARCH WE CAN GET MICROSOFT!   -- Apple

FAKE

If it fell from the front of the device, how about?
Fakest thing I&#39;ve ever seen

Hahahaha u kidding me??
Music?

It could be a good feature , but infortunetly they would explode that way

SCHEISS FAKE

not even nasa have that technology

Damn if that Was true

what bullshit
I laughed so hard at this.

If u ask me... I will say NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE... Yep, I know it&#39;s a fake but this is a awesome idea maybe the future phone could have this...

yes hehe
Animation

So with the Iphone 7 we cant do drop test RIGHT???LIKE IF U AGREE

What if it lands on its front?

Yok ammina

Nice background music. Can anyone identify the soundtrack ?

this would save phones.  it would make phones not be damaged.  therefore, apple would LOSE money to do this, so they wouldn&#39;t

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

OMG THIS IS SI FUNNY <a href="">#superphone</a>

so FAKE!!!!!!!!!

Someone has too much time on their hands...

That&#39;s actually pretty smart

fake

I wish

FALSE

lol

LMAO this shit is hilarious

iPhone is pushing the limits more and more, it's amazing ❤❤👍👍👍
fake

lol apple would screw people with this &quot;it costs 39.99 for a new bottle 1 bottle lasts about a month&quot; lol totally would happen

Bwaaaahhahaha

this is a intrestring idea but not realistic

No way will there be a co2 tank but still hilarious

Sonitdac finally made another concept. That iPhone with built-in projector and Android porn playing in the background was starting to get a little boring

kkk

How wide is the imagination of the nation.. no more!!
hahah  very very lol

HAHAHAHA

hahahaha that&#39;s made my day :D

this is actually a very cool concept.

cool

Iron man phone
Personally I think it’s false
This is pretty freaking cool. It&#39;s obviously fake, but c&#39;mon. That&#39;s awesome.

Lololololol this is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever seen!😁

good concept

No way the 7 hasn&#39;t even came out yet

An then you realise it is 130$ a CO2 tank...

Thats fucking genius

Sure jan
It&#39;s fake but very well made video

Lol!!!!!!!

Are you sending the iphone into fucking space lmao

UNBELIVEABLE HAHAHAA

wtfffff

I put hydrogen in mine so it floats

Fake

and if it falls off the screen
Another way is to put your iphone in glass of redbul for 12hrs, it will literally grow wings

very nice idea. maybe the new iphone can make some Coffee, wash the dishes and clean your room. and than u can buy the iphone 7 adult this is for the single guys😂

Fake?

hahaha 😊😊 so real
fuck yes, because I will believe it
Would be cool for the price of only $2000

So much bullshit

you better take care of your phone and don&#39;t drop it instead.. people gotta learn XD

What

HAHAHAHHAHA K

OMFG I am dead xD
Im so sure, this would probably bring down sales because people keep breaking Iphones so i bet apple would not do this.

dis real or fake

so dumb
wtf

most retarded idea i have ever seen

I claim bullshit.
good installation

OMG :D. Isn&#39;t it easier to just make it more durable?

Ridiculous. I&#39;m amazed

Are you making a phone or making a Soyuz space vehicle?!!!

This concept is actually good

yohaminnna
so yeah, may it be from your desk, or mount EVEREST, your iPhone knows the distance to the floor...:P

Yeah right
This is actually a pretty cool concept

So fakkke
lmfao

Well, now there&#39;s another thing I can relate RCS boosters to other than Kerbal Space Program.

If only

Sooooo fake

What ._.

THIS IS FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!👎😫
Imagine it facing the screen and the air pushed it down faster 😂😂😂😂😂

I&#39;ve been working on an amazing concept like this, save some money and buy a fucking case

Just dont drop the fucking thing... Is it that hard?

more like Ishuttle
Two words fake, animated.

Lmao

I hope you know that this video is fake

What about putting Airbag unit?

Hoverboard iphone ?? 😂

thats the iPhone 6

Falcon-9 )))

it can&#39;t happen then the phone must be tooo heavy and what if the nozzles breaks then all Co2 will leak and everybody knows what will happen battery issues screen display wil stop working

imagine...😲😈
imagine...😲😈
Ishit

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

Fake

This could happen but if it falls face Dow and the co2 gos off it would be a harder slam

I like how they always guess it will have holographic display and a keyboard instant recharge but damn what time era do these ppl think they are it I have 100000000 bucks on that this feature won&#39;t be in the new iPhone 7 and the picture has a headphone jack new iPhone doesn&#39;t have one

LMAO!!!

so many other things i expected.....

all these people on other videos, even this one are saying its fake... OH REALLY BECAUSE ITS NOT LIKE IT SAYS THAT IN THE TITLE, AND DESCRIPTION... thats what concept means u dumb fucks... well at least it means its an idea... of course its not real.

This is so stupid wtf🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🤑😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡
fake !!

If this was real, how much could Apple sell this for

fake nigga

That&#39;s cool but fakeSo don&#39;t get fooled

Really bro.....

Apple plz include this

and when iPhone 7 releases then +Sonitdac  is going to rename it iPhone 8 that&#39;s what is he doing

bendede was
seems pretty legit

if this thing exist, i think techrax would have hard time to destroy this thing

Ha ha I wish this was real😌

Who&#39;s watching in 2016

showing it as concept will be cool but saying parachute system in new iphone 7 thats total bulls**t. Idk why people doe these things wrapped around displays,parachute system, some laser keyboard coming out. These are ideas not new iphones. And apple is one of the companies that lack in technology. Its just their name and design thats it..

i think its bullshit

is that gas made of human fart

That tank is so small to fit that amount of air and some dust can get inside those holes.

this won&#39;t happen

Lol this is sooooo real

it would be cool if it was real

Will it be true
bullshit

Big and nothing else
It would be awesome I doubt that this will ever happen... unless NASA pairs with Apple

SHAKE PHONE AND TURN ON VALVES

Wtf?

yeah sure...
what about the glass part isnt that what we care about most?

CGI🤑 Nice Try
iphon cosmos edition
Like that is happening

wtf is this

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

It&#39;s a great video, and a fantastic concept, but can you not call it like an iPhone 7 concept, I think it would be better to just call it an iPhone concept, I mean we all know they will never do that with the iPhone 7, if they barely changed the original design of the first iPhone ever since, I really doubt apple will ever have something truly innovative and unexpected in their devices.

if only

Wtf...

The iPhone 7 is not having a headphone jack to it

it was animation

SO FAKE

Hahaha of course

fαкє!!!
A terrorist&#39;s new weapon.

LOL :D

I have a dream ;)

speak Spanish
Fake

It may come out

😂

the date on that I phone is my bday

Amazing idea... The sad thing is, we don&#39;t have the abilities to do that complicated system in a &quot;cheap&quot; way .. But nice idea!

This is an animation

we need to put this co2 tank on the ass of iphone 100000? and if dont see indicator or low co2 and falls from 20 meters and collide it will explode.co2 explode +   battery explode =no iphone. and if it has leak you need 10000$ per minute

What&#39;s is the name of the music please ?

:DDDDDD

what the Fuck i just Saw....!! Swat Kats edition Iphone... LOLZ

fucking vedios
is real this?

I&#39;m not sure the last drop will succeed : )

ur funny

I know
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I doubt they will do that cos if their trying to sell it more and if one gets broken, they want customers to buy it more not make it protective.

hahahhahahahhahahahahahaha.

you will have a jetpack for 15 seconds XD

Funny

Als ob

So funny

Are you suggesting that there is co2 in a phone.  Thats really funny.....how are you gonna refil if you run out. and what about cases wouldnt that cover the holes.  this is flawed in so many ways.

is this at all plausible?

Does that mean i can jump off burj khalifa and expect the condition of my body to remain the same?

really good video for such a stupid thing, the creators should work in video games or animated movies

Wow! I hope that for the next iPhone, it&#39;s amazing...

Fake

Nice idea

That&#39;s sick
Wow

Hi apple can you create akphone47 if you are agressed in the street

That would be cool :D
how did you get that rocket fuel ?

😂😂😂😂

Fakephone - -

You can see it is anematet when the guy dropp it

That is never going to happeni

Ma too

That Is never Everg

Android makes a phone that becomes a plane to compete and rename their company the autobots

This is hilarious

giving the autistic girls who own these to throw their phone in the air

lol yeah right XD

That&#39;s pretty gay mate

airophone

real?!

so funny I laugh to hard   ...... even I broke my precious bone of leg ..........hahaha

lol so fake its sad plus if the iPhone 7 would be like that a lot of people would hate it cuz you would have to keep putting in the &quot;gas&quot; and I know apple would put those &quot;gas&quot; high in price and everyone would love that but $$

I swear it is a scam
not ONE of the predictions on this fucking channel have turned out correct so i highly doubt this one will

100 dollars for CO2 tank lol

Good thing if this was real, then I could make an AC grapple hook without ordering the Co2 online

So I can buy Co2 everywhere whenever I want and pollute the environment even more than I already do?

Well only some know that apple have patented this.

How do you know that it will have a Parachute system

a when you use a shake to share app or something like that it will release co2 lol

this will create more global warming

It s tottaly rubbish!

lies and provocation
Bullshit

So now you cant bring your iphones to the airport because it contains an explosive gas

Your iPhone could land face flat and die

lol you can see its animated

Who liked this shitty fake ? ??

No won&#39;t even happen 20% of Apple&#39;s money is from people re-buying new phones or fixing there old broken ones.

The iphone 7 has not even came out yet

Awasome

Hahahahahhaha

nice effort but no one belived  for one second its real...

FAKE

WTF is this

AHHAha I LAUGHED SO HARD!!
Fake ass bitch 😂😂

wtfis this shit 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I think they should just install a very small cat to insure that it lands face up every time.

If only that was real

So.... If it lands on the screen ... the parachute Boosts it so the screen cracks more than it would have

its a phone not a hovercraft lol btw nice joke

Awesome

HAAHHAHAHAH OMG OMG OMG :&#39;D :&#39;D

Lol I was laughing at this idk why

wow

It&#39;s seems like Tony Stark have taken over Apple.

Stupid af

really

This is the most stupidest shit I&#39;ve ever watch about iPhones

so can i finally jump off a bridge?

Idk wether to beleive this or not. XD

Is this real somebody tell me please

It wouldn&#39;t work, you would need some sort of compressor, because that little CO2 tank would not have enough pressure to push the phone up. Also what happens if it lands screen down, or on its side?

Lol, yea right

wow!! amazing !!
Seems legit
And why not a lighter...? lol
you guys are taking this too serious😂

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK LOL

Can this iPhone drive by it self

NEW! The flying Iphone 7...... ar you fk kidding me:|

Fake

sonitdac should invent their own phone company

Next: &#39;Aeroplane mode.&#39;
Haha, sweet
soo funny man!!! hahahahaha

I'm a sucker
Fake :3

I laughed so hard

this chain deceive us so that I want to puke on them

keren 👍👍
And then when it comes out, we&#39;ll all be like, &#39;Oh... Well I wonder what the iPhone 8 is gonna look like!&#39;

Apple coming up with something useful?!HAHAfunny

hahahaha wt...
I laughed so hard but I thought about it for a minute this is actually a good idea

if only he wasnt full of himself

If only this was a new feature... Apple would probably sell this new type of phone for 1000 pounds.

is this the new Star Wars trailer

hahahhahahah

idiot

Bull shit

jajajajaajajajajajajajajajajsjajsjajajJajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
Finally a phone that really makes it with the airplane mode

Damn this shit faker than porhub ads saying there are millions of bitches in 3.02 miles away

Omg, its crazy! Apple wouldn&#39;t add this.1. Thats works only when your IPhone is charged2. Thats isn&#39;t conveniently3. Its danger to charge your IPhone with CO2, and it may not work!Ssory for bad English, I am from Russia and I have used Google translate some times ;)

This Fuck!

Iron Man is real :o =))))))))

well if that was the case i&#39;d be dropping my phone many a times that day!

Funny Video

And he flew and I flew from him
Can we see the future with this?Does this have time machine in it?Really curious.I guess we can even chat with aliens.

Was this serious or sarcastic

That&#39;s dumb
faaaaake

Great animations bro

Who else thought a mini parachute was gonna come out the concept phone? lol seriously… Apple would never make this as they want to make as much money as possible lol… keep dreaming...

They can make it fly but not waterproof    It is so fake

Is..that real ??

So fake

Great! Another way to add co2 too our atmosphere !!!

Word😂😂 nigga plz stop with this fake asf video 😂😂👏🏼👌🏼

So fake it&#39;s not even funny

I thought it was gonna be like1) the balloons that inflate around Mars rovers when they landOr2) a actual parachute

fake

lo

I bet the maker of the video works for Apple and wants you to buy it so he gets paid.

I&#39;m done

JK BRO SORRY OK😔😔😔

That was fake because my mom works at Apple INC and I told her if they even made the screen and she said not even making the back of the iPhone 😐😐😐

lol what happens if it fall on the screen

I&#39;ve also got an idea for the iphone 7.  nuclear reactor core inside so the battery only has to be recharged every 1000 years. What do you think?

All your concepts are false! I don&#39;t believe you

wow

Bullshit
what is this bullshit ?

mwahahahahahhaahahahha you wil never sit your iphone down again!!!! hahahahahahhhahahaha

I'm slammed!!😭😂 I can't stand up anymore!!!😂😝
awsm idea ..but it will probably not happen in real iPhone 7 ..

Ueah ok
because apple doesnt really care about those kind of future tech apple cares about the style it looks and if people gonna buy it

thats good idea but i dont think apple is gonna make that

hhh

First Of all IPhone 7 Doesn&#39;t have Headfone Jack!! It&#39;s Fake*!!!!

iPhone is already serving bullshit things &amp; this one is disaster hahahahahahahahahahahaha

How do i upgrade my iphone 4s with ios 7.1.2 to ios 8 or above?

How do i upgrade my iphone 4s with ios 7.1.2 to ios 8 or above?

Hahaha 😂
Haha get a life
fake

Lol that is funny

Finally... A new video!

What a lie
is it possible

Im laughing like crazy, this would make the phone so much heavier! LOL

bullshit

LOL soooo fakealso apple wants u to break ur phone so u buy a new one duhhh

Semma I can't afford this phone
so this means i can jump of a cliff with 10 of thest straped ti my feet?

😂😂😂

What about the front screen....

Is this real

100 $ per bottle of co2

stop video at 51 seconds. ASSEMBLED IN CHINA!!! 😂😂

Ok, but, what happens if it lands on the screen?

HAHA omg thats the nmost stupidiest thing i have ever seen haha\

Friends, when will iPhone 7 come to Turkey?
that could be great !

What if it landed on the screen?

this is such Bullcrap!! when the iPhone 7 does come out, i highly doubt it would have that as a feature aswell... xD

Hahaha, great job with photoshop, to MUCH laugh...

lol.

What kind of music?

to be honest i would just drop it for the fun of it, anyway think how much thicker it would be to have a c2o tank in and how much it would cost as well as the good chance of the thing breaking and just going of. also how dose it know when to set of dose it use camera?god this is like a flipping rant

wow
That&#39;s so cool!!

it&#39;l be good when this was true

okay first it looked like the iphone 5s and then like the 6 LOL

This would be amazing and revolutionary. A jet propulsion system that small and accurate. Well it would use air, cost 10 times as much, and it doesn&#39;t exist. Plus it seems a little stupid.

yep good luck with that bud

😂 I fucking wish
Fake

Is this real?

ROFL XD LOL LMAO Whats that song?

Fake

hahahahhahahahahha lmfao wtf...........
hahahaha

and screen

That&#39;s not real

best bullshit in the world

So fake even the hand in fake

xDD this is not just a phone this is iron man

Cool

OMG

what if it didnt fall on back

this will never happen to iphones, maybe to android but i dont think so

if it happens apple will start selling CO2 tanks in $500

fake

you guys are so stupid, this isnt in the iphone 6

This is shit. Co2 is also dangerous, idiot. And you video quality and song choice is shit.

Never in a million years 😂😂

What if it fell screen first? Lol

Still breaks
that would acually be sickif apple sees this vid and they do it hats off to them

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

7s added feature to provide co2 from mouth and o2 is omitted

clearly fake

Figo

wooooow

Hell no!

Not going to happen because iPhones are ment to break so then you shall buy a new iPhone which means Apple making more money

If only

lolz my stomach is paining by laughing at this haha

that be awesome

As if :P

This is sick but sadly not happening this lifetime or any lifetime on that matter

I don&#39;t agree with the parachute but this is probably how the iPhone 7 will look

Is that real?

This is the funniest shit ive ever seen :)))))))))))))))))

MAYBE THIS IS NOT REAL BUT I LOVE YOUR THINKS !

r u fucking kidding me
this wont never fucking happencause apple will make their phones as thin as paper that means it floats to the floor

u wish

u can so tell at the end the hand was animated

This is dumb.

Falls screen first.

this is bullshit

im going to breath to recharge my i phone 1 sec

AHAHAHAHA. This render is not worth the time spent on it. Keked so hard

top

WOW!!! HAHAHAHAHHha

its not true you just have to look on Google
But it doesn't fly and crash into the ceiling
fake

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH FUNNY

Get out = talk nonsense
😃😃😃😃😃

😃😃😃😃😃😃😃

Wtf.

Seems legit
the most stupid thing i&#39;ve seen. yet it was grapically well done lol. but seriously there are so many better, easier, more safer and cost effective ways. case for one? pop out hinges? stronger glass technology? list goes on.

This a joke........ Right....

what bullshit
lied 😂✋👎
PHAHAHAHAHAHA can&#39;t stop laughing

But all Iphone fall on the screen side = )

Super cool but I wish

fake

fake

music?? :D

Lol

😂😂😂😂😂😂👊🏻 i love it!
hahahaha. We all now this would never happen, but is still fun to watch!!

deez nuts
Amazing concept :)
Naebschiki
nice idea, but definitely <b>not</b> going to happen

This is without a doubt the coolest concept ever but in reality I just cant see this but it was pure entertainment

not iPhone 7
Airplane mode does the same thing!

kkkkkkkkkkkk where from? My God, how funny... lol Come on, friend. hahahahaha
Only if that was possible. Lol :P

This is the IPhone 6

No mame co2 jaja

so fake

keep dreaming ......
in 2132 this consept is alive :D

I like you Sonitdac , you have big dreams.

Fake

lol

Nice Fake!But it is Fresh

I HOPE

nice effects
FYI, new apple product CO2 tank for unreasonable price

A Iphone 6 weights 129 grams, a small little Co2 tank will not be able to slow down the fall of the iPhone, this idea is so stupid.

It&#39;s fake I don&#39;t know why all IPhone fans make fake videos to make Apple iShit good plz at least show sth real to reflect the best features on this shit but I know u can&#39;t find as shit still shit whatever happens that why u idiot make like those videos

Nice video !

Funny
great animation

😃😃

OMG!!

This is your concept not Apple&#39;s

dont think so......!!! will ever happen

This could actually be a good feature

Damn airplane mode just got real.

<a href="">#TeaserTrailer</a>

awzome idea
its not really any different...

Fucking awsome !!!

Noone buys this...

nice animation

Aga, there is no such system 😱😱
That&#39;d be kinda cool but that wouldn&#39;t be very affective in real life situations and there wouldn&#39;t be enough internal space for that

you should be the owner of apple, sony ect..........

All you need is a protector.. That&#39;s it.

A MUST HAVE FOR A SLIPPERY IPHONE (ALSO ADDS MORE COST!!!)

Lol

this is so fake

this is so fake i am laughing so hard xD

how about I&#39;ll put butane gas lolz it wud launch, just a rocket..lolz

my starmobile just farted lolz more fart to come with false prediction to iPhone 7 so and so forth...We will wait if apple will launch the real phones...not just like this...hover type lolz

What is this crap info?? With an extra edit!
lol

i know a phone who has this

Fake one

i wonder if someone forget and fill helium inside it

Apple would go out of business, there wouldn&#39;t be anymore broken iphones, therefore no need for a new one...

The most ridiculous thing ever imagined

What if I drop it on Mount Himalaya?

Fake

Seems legit
Well thats just stupid

That a very good idear

these allusions are funny!

Omg 😹😹😹😹
cool

YA RIGHT

nice phone

Is this real???

Fake

this guys took Stupidness to whole new level

so what if it falls face first ? Then it will slam it into the floor?

Hahaha don't suck
Iron man you are became  in a iphone 7??? xD

LOL 😂😂😂😂 SO FUNNY(but fake)
yaa and den phone will fly to order my food and will bring home groceries

That would be awesome

FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKA

This video needs Johny Ive touch.

Looks like fun lol
this is probably the dumbest idea ever

Oh my mother and my nasil are fake
Somewhere over the rainbow

What if it fell so that the screen was facing the ground when it fell!?!? XD Great concept but has tons of flaws.

Would the system accelerate the phone when its screen face to the floor and make some more damage to it?  Is this equipment useless when it upside down?XP

What happens if it lands on the screen?

wow it&#39;s for real??  this ad just like mission impossible movie they should ask Tom Cruise be an actor in this ad😎

lmfao

No, that certainly won’t happen...!!!
in romanian
ora not real

Not happening in a long time

iphone 7 can fly

A spacecraft, for example!!!!! :3
wish dis was true....

come to lie
Now they can sell carbon dioxide for money ;)

what if it lands on the front? are there jets on the front?

so nasal
There's no way it can be done. Because there is no height measurement in the building used.
Oh my lies lol
fake

Chutiyapa

Wich phone are u using for this vid

what if rolls?

No İPhone 7
Fake

Fake

Just make the future iPhones with harder materials. Problem solved. Wtf kind of childish solution is this?

wtf???

We appreciate the entertainment efforts

I have to laugh, it's a 6s and a phone would be too flat to hold co2 cans
A big problem will be the heat of your hand and the iPhone components on the CO2 tank. Since it&#39;ll be gaseous  pressure will increase as temperature increases.

I&#39;m here to place reality in to this concept. Sure, it is a cool way of protecting your phone, but it is also unrealistic. CO2 is carbon dioxide, which is a gas that is in the air we breathe, but is not strong enough to slow an approximate 3-10 ounce phone. Second, there is now way you can simply afford to refill that tank, because pressurized gases, cost money, so the tiny co2 refill tank would cost around $100. Not only that,but there is now way you can craft a falling detection sensor without placing special materials over that sensor. Going back to the co2 situation, the phone to be casually dropped cannot be emitted as a white gas into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is also a poisonous gas.

Trash

Tradh

I might get a iphone 7 ensted of a samsung galaxy tab 3

u guys are wrong their is going to be 3 types and technology is not this advanced there might not even be a home button and just soooo wrong

YA&#39;LL GETTING TOO cREATIVE

if this was real I would totally get it

Wow now we don&#39;t need parachutes to skydive XD

nice phone.where did you find it

Since it is not <a href="">9:41</a> it will make me laugh

brother very good either

not is real concept

good animation

Antigravitation foreva!
Oh man, how beautifully he shakes it!
Yeah i just broke my iPhone and i didn&#39;t find any parts that needs to break out of it and make it 3d stuff and cool screens so i need my money back please.(jk)

what about the charger the tank is covering it!!!

So Apple can put a parachute system in a phone, but the can&#39;t put a bigger battery..........

iPhone NASA 😂😂

Apple could never do it because they want us to redeem their products from year to year

OK, Ready landing to Mars.

I like it very much.
The probe system...that gas...isn't enough to fool you.
maybe ıphone 11s ..
AHAHAHAHAHA FUCKING HERESY
fake

Yes Yes Yes. You're riding a motorcycle at 100 km/h and it flies out of your pocket, original. What else can you inventive guys come up with? Maybe a built-in refrigerator or mini vacuum cleaner? Well, views can be increased by this too.
<b>put Phone on table</b> <b>Phone flyies away</b> &quot;Fuck&quot;

buying

this is actually pretty cool though you would have to refill it every 3 seconds

untruth

Awesome concept....

reaction control system and parachute system are two different things, right? what we got here should be a RCS

So are we going to have to take it to the Apple store to get our Co2 cartridges refilled? I just don&#39;t get how this is a good solution. It looks like they kept the 3.5mm headphone jack as well!

Even though I hate stupid concepts this is some solid animation.

Guess this would be made by tony stark (ironman) instead of apple! Cool concept though! Thumbs up from me!

keep dreaming
that was actually pretty cool

Of course it&#39;s fake but the effects are awesome!

fart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nighing, thanks
Fake and gay

Don't drop it and that's the end of the matter.
A cheaper and more efficient way to solve this problem.... don&#39;t drop your phone.

Too much space take up it would

This is fucking 3d look at that girls hand boys 😂😂

and if i really parachute? or maybe drive bike fast? my phone will just fly out of my pocket... its bad/unreal concept

This video gave me autism.

Designer makes impossible project in dream, Engineer makes dream come true.
awesome concept, although it will never be implemented into iphone 7

WADAFAK ??!!!

You really thought there were going to be RCS xDD Like on a shuttle, don't be kidding, it's a phone ^^
just sayin, what if you just wanted to throw your phone around for fun haha

so it has the airplane mode..and now the parachute :D

what if we put a phone case

This totally isn&#39;t fake😂

I see I wasn&#39;t the only one thinking about a parachute system.

Best concept in the world

Great idea man! But it&#39;s apple, they want it to be more &quot;sleek and modern&quot; -_-

Ok, I thought this was a dope concept... Until the end with the tiny ass CO2 tank and I was like what the actual fuck

This is so dumb

samsung would be the first to do that like the edge

PLS pls do these stuff more often, i need cool shit to watch

only if it was real it would of been badass

patrocined for stark industrial

no what else...
Accelerate global warming

Fake
Fake

87 Hao Xiaoyou also used it once and the battery ran out.
I will drop my cell phone on purpose
wow so fake

CO2 Recharges: 100$.

How will it know proximity to ground?

IRONPHONE

I laughed so hard.....

omg XD XDXDXDXD

What is the point of this invention if the phone usually falls face down? It’s better then let the airbags pop up in the corners :D
This is a wonderful idea, but it is easier to make a shock resistant device. Sadly this thing won&#39;t happen anytime soon.

I'm Russian)
87

how about if it drop with reverse side.......speed up?

R U KIDDING ME ?

Hello， we&#39;re press company ETTV from Taiwan and we saw your brilliant work of iPhone 7 - Parachute System on Youtube，and want to use your video for our internet News Which will be post on our facebook fanpage，and we&#39;d like to get your authorization to use the video, Hope we can get your response soon sincerely ETTV

Ahah, someone believes in this nonsense
made me laugh
What if it falls face down?
falls face down, so the system will also speed it up
damn I saw
ahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahha

you know your iphone is shit when you have to fuel it just so it won&#39;t break  (gas prices)

Why create such complex systems, maybe it’s easier to make it from unbreakable material?
wow!!!

SOOO FAKE LMAO

i remember watching, these videos when i was little, thinking they were real.

hoax and stupid iphone

really?

Wow iam so happy

don't see
and also you can use as acar jumper.

iphone 7 is also bullet proof..

I RON MAN

I like it but they should make it recharge automatically
This guy should be hired by AppleHe would be emloyee of the century 😂😂😂😂

but what if it lands in the front?

it may gonna happen but not with iphones it could happen with samsung,lg,hawawi,sony ,motorola types of brands not with that sucking iphone which is almost 2 or 3 years back from other mobiles

fuck
and if it lands on the screen?

this should come with the next iphone since many people worry about broken phones

necessary gadget for the gadget...
Ironman?

A iPhone 6s has turned into a iPhone 7

SO PUMPED TO GET THE IPHONE 7 ! Who else?
Thats total bullshit like that will ever happen

This would litterally never work

this is bullshit

The terrorists will love this idea for traveling via airplanes.

plz add this apple

so if I put some together I should be able to have a hover board?

why do you going to work in apple? your idea is the best.

Have to admit that ur videos are cool

keren ☺
I have arrived in VENEZUELA
Vin Diesel&#39;s iPhone! :D
and if it fall at the screen side the gas will do it&#39;s work very well ;)!

Iphone 7 or Iphone 8

Pls do this Apple!!!

so where can I buy for some CO2 gas :)))

Class
Wow that&#39;s so fake because the hand is animated

I think I&#39;ll just put a case on my phone. Also, still a home button and big bezels? :-)

Call me when it really works, not to watch a silly animation...

i just wanna say : LMAO. yeah right

fake and gay!

great now hackers can use our phones as projectiles.....

kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk if this is true here in Brazil there will no longer be a waiting line to get a kidney!!! everyone selling
That would be great, but Apple is not inventing anymore...

what kind of bullshit is this, to save space they move the headphones to the lightning, and then there’s the valve system ahahaha
Holy shit, we're in the future
There is IgAS for recharge the co2 tank :p

pure stupid innovation...ty for waste my mobil data

a protective shell is good too...
iPhone 7 will never CO2 not believe this idiotic commercials, say that just changed the connector 3.5 Headphone

this is the most unrealistic and stupid thing I have ever saw on a phone! like the graphics though.

iPhone is shit
Just fucked up
this is fucking nonsense
This is not a fake iPhone. I work at Google and Steve Ballmer asked us to design this for Pixar.

Om nom nom...... Smells fake!! !!!!
This won&#39;t happen, not yet

How cool and useful would that be 😁 awesome!

They could just make the frame a bit stronger, and make sure it doesnt bend nor break when being dropped.

c&#39;mon guys, it&#39;s just a joke, and a very good one :) well done mate

Brilliant idea except for the CO2. But still good thinking!

You Should built up your own Label and try to actually build some of your concepts... no matter how expensive the product gets i am shure u will find manny interested customers^^

Anything is not possible
so i can jomp off the cn tower?

if it falls off the screen it will be very bad, don’t cook at home
Good concept tho

Guys shut the fuck down , (fake fake fake blah blah blah) this guy makes 3D animation  , ideas and some stuff that would be useful on the future , I bet you can&#39;t make like 1 of his videos , even if it fake it&#39;s still possible as prototype , and people could make models like that as test and other stuff , he have many nice ideas

Or get the oderbox defender

You are a born engineer

Why not XD

So fake!

That&#39;s actually a pretty neat idea.

not possible (now?) i think i can create a prototype of that with todays technology... there are hoverboards. ill create a schematic of it tomorrow. i think i can make it on a ipad mini 4... i will see what i can do

Fake

lol fuck this bullshit. it will be out about 100 years later

and epic!

NOT FAKE!!!

YOU MADE AN NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWAHWHAHAHHAWHWHAHWHHDHDHOOOHOOOHOOHOOHOOHOHOOHOHHOOH
what is it lands on the front?

QUE JATO TIVE QUE I PRA OUTRO PAIS PRA COM CIGUI UM IPHONE 7

facke

i know everybody knows that

You a German People?
Awesome concept, but after being inside iPhones a few times, I&#39;d say that it would not happen THIS way because we all know there would be that one idiot who doesnt know when to stop filling the Co2 and BAM. as well the alarm is right under where the battery (of course this can be relocated near the wifi antenna) and the final thing I will say is the Co2 tank leaves no room for the touch id and microphone.

that is actually a very good idea, but i think we wont see anything like that until 2027 or something like that :D

fake

Dat fakeness doe

Battery life: 20&#39;sec

Wow amazing job! My video sucks compared to this!!!  How did you do this :O
