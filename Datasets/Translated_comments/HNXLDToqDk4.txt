O people of Florida, repent to God in sincere repentance so that the wrath of the Lord, glory be to Him, will be removed from you, because our Islamic religion facilitates disasters. The disaster you have is the wrath of the Almighty, glory be to Him. Repent from sins, and if you cannot surrender to God, then repent from sins. Perhaps what you are in will go away, because what you are in is only wrath. The Almighty, may His Majesty be glorified, because of your many sins. Repent from the sins. Lighten your burdens by reducing your sins and transgressions. In our Islamic religion, charity extinguishes the wrath of the Almighty, may His Majesty be glorified.
No God except Allah
May God protect him in all Arab countries, God willing
Whoever sees him disbelieves in God
Glory be to God, Lord, your mercy
No God except Allah
He laughs
God is great, Glory be to God
