Please continue this thanks you

Get titanium or adamantite ore make that type of armor then get the storm bow and get holy arrows and potions + heart lanterns for extra regen kill (destroyer (boss) first) after you kill him, and make asphalt block make area out of it then craft the ( mega shark ) and craft cursed bullets at least 999 of them and kill (twins/boss) then skeletron) craft the hallowed pickaxe with the mech bosses souls and go to jungle mine chlorophyte the green ore then get 3 turtle shells for the turtle armor then kill (plantera/boss) then find the jungle temple and kill golem and make beetle armor/ ASK MORE IF NEEDED🙂

Was it too much to ask that this series would get completed? Obviously it won&#39;t be now because Pewds is living it up in Japan, but man it&#39;s disappointing we never got a full series of this. Full, edited Terraria series are rare as hell.

still waiting for part 7 :(((

Chlorophyte looks like hellstone but green

come back

BOI I just bridge ut to da clouds if  I were you

I thought he might return to the game when the Terraria x Pewdiepie merch dropped,  unfortunately not

This is so bullshit

3 years, PEWDIEPIE!! its been 3 years NOW! WHERES PART 8 WE DESERVE?????

i feel bad for all his viewers, you guys get dry endings xd

We need to get pewds to come back and beat the game

WOW did not expect the rest of the series to need to be paid to watch. Thanks Felix 😒

Terraria&#39;s art style reminds me a lot of legend of the brofist. Who else agrees?

you didn&#39;t beat the game...

how does bro find a hallowed kay and blessed apple within 5 munites

Completed this series on 14/July/2023 around <a href="">21:19</a> (edit) and started 13/July/2023 I forget the time lol but its around 21-23(Commented at <a href="">21:21</a>)

Felix: &quot;I beat the game&quot;Terraria: <b>Impending doom approaches</b>

I miss this series

It all returns to nothing

PEWDIPIE COME BACKKKKKK

WE NEED TERRARIA PT7

He had THE BEST SEED for this play through, finding rare godly variants of weapons. Anyone know the seed? I’ve never found a enchanted sword shrine.

where part 7

Yea plsssss
Bro really got a hallow key, corruption key, and a turtle shell 2 seconds after getting into hard mode then quit like he wasn&#39;t the luckiest motherfucker on the planet.

This series skips so much stuff. When did you get the mithril pickaxe? When did you get the magical unicorn? Were those parts just edited out?

Imagine hi doing legendary mode, he would get royally clapped lol

I’ve played for hundreds of hours before getting a fucking key and this dude gets it in 30 min

My man didn’t even manage to cover the surface of the game. It has SOO much more, once you enter hardmode that’s when the fun things starts to kick in. Too bad the server got discontinued

Why are the next 6 exclusive? Gd 😒

No fing way he got hallowed  key (1 in 2500) and a blessed  apple which has 3% chance to drop

I&#39;m NEVER EVER GONNA PAY TO WATCH ANYONES VIDEOS EVER
The moment he didnt kill the bunny

Bring this back

Bring the series back it was so fun too watch 🤙

Rewatching

cool

Pls make every vedio public please

Beat mech bosses beat plantera beat golem beat lunatic cultists beat celestial pillars then beat moon lord then you beat the game

When pedwiepie is fighting skeletron prime Rayman 2 music is playing the best feeling

We need part 7

I would love to see more of this series!

bro his character looks like a forbidden jojo&#39;s part 7 character lol
continuation of terraria experience!!! Beat all the bosses :D

Disappointing

Really wish he would&#39;ve just googled what to do when he got stumped instead of streaming the game. With Terraria being as old as it was 8 years after release, loads of people were inevitably going to not have the brain cells to know to not fucking spoil him on what all to do, ruining his sense of discovery and exploration. Pretty disappointing that&#39;s what ended up happening

Bring it back

<a href="">8:51</a> he got a turtle shell

WTF IT TOOK ME 3 PLAYERS FINISHING THE GAME TO HAVE BLESSED APPLE

Plz bring this back

Go to Terraria wiki like everyone else

for real tho how is he getting rare items while not trying HAHAHA

The classic people giving up after pre hardmode

Bring it back!!!!

you should use pylons

The vids skip so mich progress but still fun to watch

pewdiepie: can’t mine an ore “i beat the game!”pewdiepie: can’t beat a boss“i beat the game!”

&lt;pweds&gt;i Don&#39;t know what else to do&lt;destroyer&gt;... &lt;Twins&gt;... &lt;Skeletronprime&gt;...

<a href="">8:30</a> it is chlorophyte

Now summon king slime

Can&#39;t watch the rest. Lame. Loved the series though.

My man you didn&#39;t finish the game lol

Imagine if PewDiePie randomly scrolled through steam trying to find some good game he can find then he find tmodloader

<a href="">2:12</a> <b>Corruption World</b>ok so were gonna stop the &quot;crimson&quot; from spreadingLOL

just got into hard mode.

dude gets his ass kicked by prime and then said idk what to do

Pewdiepie, &quot; why do I feel like I&#39;m twelve when I play this?&quot; Because he is twelve.

E

Play Modded Terraria!!! Try Calamity first 🤪

THE GUIDE WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO

Dang that&#39;s disappointing that this series was never finished. RIP the fact he thought the game was already over wheeze-

The thing is, if felix didnt hate connor, we probably would have gotten a longer series

Bring terraria series back😭
Where update?

please continue this!!

Pewdiepie if you defeat the final boss in terraria , then you beet the game.

pleas bring back the terraria series.

You’re like 25% done so please bring the series back

There way more bosses to fight

It&#39;s too bad he hasn&#39;t continued this series.

Pewdiepie: I’ve basically beaten the entire game.   Moon Lord: Am I a joke to you?

<a href="">4:37</a> did anyone else see that pirate walking backwards?

Please bring back this series :(

I feel my heart crack
Ma,e another terraria video plz plz plz
Fighting skeleton before destroyer wtf

he has two keys without even noticing... I&#39;m sad

Pls play more

*is holding the key sword*goes after Prime with the most dinky hardmode yoyo possible

Bruhhh😆😆😆
Bruh this is so hard in mobile with 2 gb ram

The Rayman 2&#39;s ost at <a href="">10:33</a> is just too good with the fight !

Me watching this series I&#39;m a veteran playing for the worthy mastermode

PewDiePie: kills hundreds of bunnys innocentConer: accidentally kills one bunny murderer

Did he never finish this? he just had to get some better armor, maybe kill a couple of mimic´s. you could also farm the wall of flesh to get an emblem you can use, bullying Connor in the process. then you should be ready for a mechanical boss. then beat all 3, and make some hollow armor, get the green stuf ore (chlorophytebeat), beat up plantera. From then on the game can pretty much play it self.

You need to explore the clouds

i cant watch the live stream im stuck in part 6, cant afford to join

Plz Pewds bring this back 🔙

Didn&#39;t anyone noticed the painting in <a href="">0:10</a>

Get a mithtrl pick axe then get adamntaie

pewds ur next goal is getting titanium armor and killing the threeechanical bosses, preferably the mechanical worm

How the fuck you get a hallow key 5 min into hardmode lmfao

I hope Pewds play Terraria seriously after Skyrim

Miss connor

Europeans in a nutshell <a href="">12:55</a>

We want more terraria agian and chat wil tel u wat to do

Pewdiepie where is the rest of this ?

PLS DEFEAT THE MOON LORD

If you pay close attention at the end of the video...he said:&quot;smash like if you enjoyed the series. &quot; wich means that he already ended the series. But I hope I&#39;m wrong.

Please come back you have to break corrupt alters with ur holy hammer u got after wall of flesh then u can get titenum and fight skeleton prime

<a href="">0:43</a> my mom: is that a guy? me: no mom its a WOMAN. my mom: ArE yOu gaY!!!!!me: mkay.....

PEWDS, GET BACK HERE AND FINISHED WHAT YOU STARTED!

yo they put the guile meme in terraria?! The devs for this game are so cool

When he says ur poor im rich because he has 10 gold i was like bruh i have 134 platinum coin bruh

when he doesn’t even defeat any mechanical bosses, plantera, golem, lunatic cultist, the four pillars, or moon lord and he just decides that he beat the game.

You didnt even finish the game yet, you could say that killing Wall of flesh was just the start

Please make another video I love Terraria and your content

Everybody gangsta Till he plays Terraria again

Fight any mechal bosses with your better items 6. lf you beat all mech bosses then a jungle grows restless7. Find plantera bulb or farm plantera bulb after you beat all mech bosses8. best plantera with better armor and better weapons9. Coming soon!

&#39;Black beard the pirate has been arrive&quot;One piece fans : so you&#39;ve been here for a while

Dude you literally summoned a prime boss and a weapon using yoyo

u have to destroy the altars then it will give u more ore then u can get adimantide or titanium then u can make better armore then u can kill more bossen and get better wepons look at terraria wiki

Play more pls
Felix: In hardmode.Also Felix: Omg there are sharks in terrariaLol how is he just now finding the sharks

No part 7.Sad
The update is out, pewds. Please continue the series! 🙏

Pewdiepie: (Skeletron Prime) he&#39;s shooting lasers that&#39;s not fair!Also Pewdiepie: I made a strategy! (using yoyos behind cover)

Me: &quot;crys in brooke and cant get membership:

pewdiepie uses a ice yoyo and a unicorn while wearing wedding dress.Pewdiepie: WHY IS NOT DIEING?!

How the fuck did he get the unicorn in five minutes

Pumpkin event with zenith and ice event (just noting this down)

I wonder... Why it&#39;s always the new players that get awesome items lol

Part 7?
YO, this is really important for pewdiepie!!!!! you got the corruption and hollowed key. they can be used in the dungeon to unlock the hollowed and corruption chest. inside the hollowed chest holds a rainbow gun, and the corruption chest holds the scourge of the corruptor, a powerful melee weapon. these chests are found deep in the dungeon after beating plantera. which you summon by finding a small pink bulb in the underground jungle. these bulbs spawn after defeating the twins, skeletron prime, and the destroyer. i hope this info was helpful if you see this!!!!!

Bring it back plsssss

its fun to see u play, better  play coop w/ friend

wait, you guys die from pirats? Ima just keep chillin&#39; with over 100 dmg sword

HE SUMMONED THE SKELETRON PRIME

HE GOT A DAMN TURTLE SHELL FIRST TRY

new episode when :&lt;

Just do a expert playtrough “its not hard” eye of cuthulu is hard

I know what to do pewds since you are on pre hardmode, go to the under ground  of the jungle and find the pink glowing flowers and destroy it it will summon a boss called plantera. Mabye after you do it you get a jungle temple key and if you find the underground jungle temple use the key to open the door. And if you see power batteries or something in the chests. and if you go very down to the very bottom of the jungle temple, you will see the alter the light thing, use the batteries and now you have summoned a boss called the golem destroy the golem and go to the normal dungeon at night and then you see cultists around a round coin shaped thing destroy the minions and then you summoned another boss called lunatic cultist if you manage to defeat it it is a very hard battle if you managed to survive and kill the lunatic cultists you see random flesh like pillars, 2 on the right side and 2 on the left side if you defeat one of them you can get these strange artifacts and remember you get a special crafting table when you defeat the lunatic cultist alright after you defeat the pillars you will see a text from the chat that says &quot;impending doom approaches...&quot; build as high as you can and if you wait up high in the night moonlord is now summoned and if you manage to beat him with your powerful gears and all it will drop luminite that helps you to craft with the strange artifacts from the pillars. And you get a epic portal gun and a powerful weapon. make part 7 please i wrote this so you can understand it is not the end of the game. Plus you got this -Epic Gamer

pls bring the series back i already beaten moon lord

Still can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t get the news that he isn&#39;t even close to beating the game.

Who else is kinda cringing in 2021?

why didnt he finish the game

What a fukin scam he gets  money for us watching him already but to watch his new videos u have to pay for a subscription how greedy are you mate

MARZIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PEWDS PLAYED MINECRAFT I MEAN TERRARIA ALL DAY !!!! HERE&#39;S PROOOFS <a href="">7:02</a>

Ahhh the classic 5 minutes off camera and ends up getting op stuff...... Classic

Pewdiepie of you continue the series that would be awesome also the boss you summon wit the mechanical skull it summon the mech boss skeletron prime and if you want to progress you have to defeat the three mechanical bosses that are the twins, destroyer, and skelletron prime then plantera then golem then lunatic colitis and then moon lord after you defeat moon lord you have beaten the game

Man he’s so lucky with drops and spawns

The Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes during Skeletron Prime fight were great lol.

still waiting for new episode of pewds Terraria series

I want see teraria again

More terraria?

ive spent so long getting that key

I thought he was being serious for a minute when he said he’s almost finished the game😂😂😂

I missed all gameplay between end of wall of flesh and this episode, where do I find the progress?

Use your f u king nightedge sword
pewdiepie getting the hallowed key and corruption key within an hour feels like a crime

pewdiepie when sees starfury: TRASH when it is literally used to make the most powerful weapon which is the zenith

hey i don&#39;t know if anyone will see this, but is this the version of terraria on the xbox 360 bu on computer? i am so confused cause it doesn&#39;t look like journeys end.

the shell fell from the first turtle you beat. wtf. are you joking

Awww that snowman is so cute.

Yo the three mechanical bosses

Pewds: after sky cities, i think i&#39;ve beaten the game!Me: Well yes but no

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE

Imagine if he brings back the series after a year

Pls the updates out you promised 🥺

You didnt even defeat moonlord so ur not finished yet
HE KNOWS NOTHING

FUck why i need membership this dum

Plz we want more

And then he starts over and then does a livestream with ChippyGaming!

Can he like use pyllons?
Me:Uses the most intense weapons in hardmodePewDiePie:YOYO the this dude

<a href="">14:43</a>he actually said &quot;smash like if you enjoyed this *series*&quot;his intention was to quit after all...

Go to dungen and use that like purple key

Plzzzzz can u continue playing terraria

ᴅɪᴏ: <a href="">02:11</a>
Idk about this being legit tbh bc the uploads were wrong or something with episode 3 and 4 I think, not to mention the tower and the designs are pretty good till you see him on camera and it&#39;s scuffed even the little homes are walls all over the place and he said he&#39;s gonna nit pick everything and he did till like the huge skip from ep 2 to 3. Honestly seems like half of his playing time has been off camera so it&#39;s the minecraft ep1 rough and ep2 &quot;hey welcome back, I did some mining off camera and now we have a mob grinder full set of diamond armor neither weapons just got done building a beacon it was crazy&quot; like idk if I really buy it js. Regardless it was fun watching him play but this episode seemed forced and not seamless like the others? Like he was bored of the game and just ran in a circle and didn&#39;t do anything actually or even wanted too. It&#39;s been over a year and journeys end has been out for a really long time and we still don&#39;t have a video, I think he&#39;s given up. He did it for the clicks just like with mc smh. I remember him hating mc and thinking it was so stupid and pointless and just dogged on it everytime someone said something about mc. I really did enjoy the first few episodes but the juice. It&#39;s gone boys... rip.

Just defested Moon lord for first Time. Now I came Back to watch pewds. Sadly he never finished Terraria☹️

And you can use drills now

Yes

Also yes bring series back, AND WHY U NOT PICK UP TURTLE SHELL NOT LIKE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO GET IN HARD MODE

Mine titanium, fight mechanical bosses

you can get dog from frost moon I’m pretty sure

Part 7please

How dare you kill Connor

<a href="">2:12</a> says JOJO picture of Lilly’s pops up

He did a livestream with CHIPPY POGGGGG!!!!!

We need this series to defeat coco !

more terraria please

Can’t wait for the next episode

Pewds what happen to your promise

Pewdiepie? Why aren&#39;t u playing anymore

Pewds please continue this series

rip

and when you defeat empress of light in expert mode you will get soaring insignia (endless flying with wings or hover)

mind getting a better wings like the steampunk wings from the steampunker after defeating the mech bosses[skeletron prime,the twins(spazmatism and retinazer),and the destroyer]

that unicorn mount is a rare drop from some of the enemies in the hallow

with the hallowed key you can open a hallowed chest in the dungeon but you must defeat plantera first

He needs to play expert or master mode to get the exclusive boss items and loot bags.

Should we tell Felix that he needs to defeat the Moon Lord before he can officially beat the game?

<a href="">0:26</a>remember?<b>fa-fa-fabulous</b>

fighting skeletron prime with yoyos. infinite iq

Pewdiepie: There is sharks in the waterMe who knows about duke fishron: <b>plays the dancing funeral guys song</b>

Please bring this series back :(

MORE TERRARIA NOW!!1!1!!

we need the series back

Still waiting

If Scrabble and Minecraft have less than 5% similarities, how much greater than 60% have Minecraft &amp; Terraria have in common?

the hallowed key is used for golem&#39;s temple in the jungle

well will the king return to reclaim his pixel throne

Months later i am still having a seizure over how he’s just casually flexing a hallowed key

Why did you not continue this game you stoped at the begging of hardmode where you have 3 mechanical bosses to fight the destroyer, the twins and skeletron prime also you should go deep and mine adamantite/titanium depends what your world has.

Bruh why did he stoppppppp?

Bring seris BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why. Haven’t. You. Finished. It.

Please Pewds, I love this series. Bring it back

You dont get fall damage with wings on even if you fall fast

alternate title: yoyo bride and her magical unicorn vs terraria

I hope he continue his 1.3 playthrough

he forgot plantera twins destroyer and empress of light even moonlord and he forgot event bosses and invasions:pumpking ice queen santa NK-1 mourning wood and Everscream even the goblin summoner miniboss solar eclipse and mothrom mini boss

<a href="">6:57</a> can you find wally

More terraria on gaming month???

Come back

You use the Hallowed Key by opening a Hallowed chest in the Skeletron Dungeon you don&#39;t use it in the jungle ;/

Bring the searies back pls

How did he get the hollowed key it’s got a drop rate of 0.04% chance of dropping in just the hallowed

I can&#39;t believe pewd found waldo paitingThe most rarest painting ever

Why he not play it anymore :(

revive the series and add another player :&gt;

pewds: &quot;this game is easy&quot; me: <b>laughs in master mode for the worthy summoner</b>

Pew you just waste money you can craft the wings you got souls of flight and everthing

Seeing this makes me sad...

thats the stupid skeletron prime

“Beaten the whole game”About 35%

Peewwwdddss make new vid

Swedish Viking invades England <a href="">13:02</a>

Ok you gotta search up the hack to get into the jungle temple without the key then do solar eclipse to get true nights edge then you can beat the mech bosses or the “dude with the robot arms” which is one of them.

Pewds should have made a series of terraria without the member crap

Yes PewDiePie listen to my fellow Terrarians and BRIG THE SERIES BAKI guess one like is one more Terrarian

Terraria is s***

Im from Indonesian and i love TERRARIA video by PewDiePie bad English sorryyy 😂😂😂

he dosent know HOW lucky hy is

Your a little rude to just make it we have to give you money for a few videos

Dude he had hallowed key and currupt key

you should make a episode where you try to get ken to play

How on earth  chlorphite ore is there before he defeated 3 mech bosses??

BAKA CONNOR

Focus on getting souls from the different biomes, defeat the destroyer and the other mechabosses which will cause plantera to be able to spawn. Get more health from life fruits in the jungle biome. Get the key to post plantera dungeon where you can defeat the golem boss which unlocks new npcs for example. The lunatic cultist will also spawn which is another boss that you need to kill in order to defeat the moonlord and complete the game. Other than that there are many other events and bosses you have not finished but they are not mandatory!

If your not gonna keep playing terraria then at least play Minecraft

Go to old mn hause to open chest

Craft pick axe cobalt

Mr pwed get some life cyrtal

Felix can you try playing On mediumcore?

Pls do more you did not finished

<a href="">7:15</a> j did the exact same thing, however altars which location I didn&#39;t know spread it again

Are we just not going to talk about how he got a turtle shell of the first giant tortoise he killed....?

If he does return he will probably just say he beat the game again when he just killed plantara

We wanna see him defeat cuthulu 😂

Bring it back

No membership gang|||👇

Nice to see that pewds can bring together mc and terraria players Glad there isn&#39;t any kind of messages like &quot;Terraria is trash or terraria is 2d mine minecraft  or terraria is a bad game

“Jojo” shows killua. ;-:

<a href="">7:58</a>Pause it at this momentHallowed KeyIt has been cursed by a powerful Jungle creatureHow is the hallowed linked with the fricking jungle!?

Is anyone Russian? Or am I the only fool here?!
So do I have to pay just to watch the new terraria videos??

just realized his character looked like Polnareff from Jojo Part 5

did i miss an episode or something lmao

There is a reason why you follow order and dont rush the game lolYou kill mechanical worm first so you can craft the megashark and with it you kill the twins and skeletron

Holy F!<a href="">2:06</a> That’s Elsa with The water spirit and Olaf.

He looks like Elsa in frozen 2 and with Olaf <a href="">13:59</a>

F7NISH  HARDMODE!!

<a href="">2:12</a> wait thats a hunter x hunter reference not a jojo reference

Felix where is more

<a href="">1:50</a> is this why pew die pie stop making terraria vids?

No that&#39;s an EVENT

Please continue the game.. we want to see more 😭😭😭

We want more terrariaa

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <b>when he realizes he didn’t beat the game</b>

Bruh make videos on terraria we are upset its not FAIR PEWDS

Can you make a longer please intell you beat the game(you don&#39;t have to beat every boss but moonlord you haft to beat him to beat the game)

How did he get the key? Did he deafeated plantera ?

There’s like 20 other bosses lol

Lol the Terminator memes

Don&#39;t mess with itThen why you died?

You have to get the Daedalus storm bow with holy arrows then tackle the destroyer, make some hallow armor ad use the bow

JOJO REFERENCE!!

tap the apple two times

he needs to try and fight the moon lord

I don’t want pewds to take this as offense but I hate when he literally does so much off cam and I think I missed and episode and he just gets so much good stuff I know this an old series but still

Imagine Pewds Battling Empress of Light

T series has more subs

He claims he finished the game forgets one boss moon Lorde

<a href="">0:42</a> you gotta be joking its like 1 in 4000 chance to get it.

Mothron dropped eye of Cthulhu mothron also drop broken hero sword

I kill the iron boss usingEye of Cthulhu (yoyo) dropped by nothing also nothing drop broken here sword can be summon solar eclipse

the reason i dont watch any of his series in order is bc he never finishesidk why i commented this i just saw alot of peeps like &quot;finish gam&quot;

You still need to deafeat moonlord

Terraria&#39;s back in his livestreams!As long as you&#39;re paying, of course

What happened? Where are the other episodes???

Hello
Love You MEN my Monsif from maroco 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦😇
The last same face on the thumbnails..

You never finished the game.

Ok, lemme gib u a list1. Get better armour,2. Beat the Destroyer by getting a mechanical worm3. Make Hallowed Armour4. Beat the rest of the Mechs5. Find the Vampire Knives in the Dungeon6. Find a pink plant in the jungle7. Break it and beat Plantera

“Ur poor, im rich”Me: <b>has Daybreak and Full Solar Armour</b>

Give me your chicken Nuggets

Still need to fight like 10 bosses

defeat the  the mech bosses

You got a FREAKING HALLOWED KEY WITHOUT TRYING?

there is i way smater way to do it

use purification powder from the dryad

The wings give you no fall damage.

Pewdiepie: &quot;Hey guys, so I got this terra spark, ankh shield, and cellphone half an hour into hatdmode&quot;

Part 7 please

Needs to be a tier two floor gang

Looking forward to the draw, success to the channel!
That moment you wait forever for him to begin the series again but you have to pay to watch the rest of the series😭😭

@Peter struassI don’t think that He really gave up on it he just doesn’t know what else to do.

I’ll Try to get you the recipe for the sword later but for now you need to focus on getting better armor and more HP also get rid of those garbage Yo-yo’s those yo-yos that you have are not very strong. But don’t worry if you like yo-yos that much there are some in hard mode that are far stronger than the ones you have.

You use a Clementator with the ammunition from the Cyborg to get rid of the corruption.

Any Indian???

OMG I HAVE TWO JOJOS Me:Laughs in a gadget its name I dont remember.

Image Pew against Supreme Calamity
Moonlord and Empress Of Light: Hold our drinks

This guy Haas amarok... Ive been farming taht fking yoyo for ages and I still don&#39;t...

pewdiepie u need soul of ligth and soul of nigth for 3 new bosses

All these comments are so sweet feilex must love them

Anyone else notice that his character looks like polneref from JoJo

PewDiePie: <b>Ends terraria series</b> Also PewDiePie: <b>Releases it again but you have to pay money to see it because he doesn&#39;t give a shit</b>

ITS BACK

I could beat u 1v1 in terraria!

KEEP THIS SERIES GOING I LOVE TERRAIRA

Get adamantite and go fishing.Also fight the destroyer before skeltron prime .

That&#39;s so cool. Pewds

I think pewds cheated.😑😑😑😑
terminator references were real good

You can found another hearts of life on the Jugle.

when you learn about the mechanical bosses and think you are done... one thing lead to another and you find yourself fighting a bunch of aliens and celestial beings and you don&#39;t even know what TF you are doing anymore.

Pewds haven&#39;t beaten moonlord yet lmao

U should continue the series                                       Anyone else? &lt;3

You have to defeat the Mek bosses then and then you can mine that green stuff

Defeat moonlord hehe
My friend: what&#39;s the meaning of PewDiePieMe:you pew you die and you don&#39;t get a pie😂😂🤣🤣🤣

Come back to Minecraft Felix

Yoo More terrira

Pewds kill captain I’m the captain now

<a href="">1:40</a> that’s a unicorn not a horse<a href="">1:50</a> THAT A SHARK

So let me understand, you&#39;re an eye-patch, leaf-winged, unicorn riding, bride ridding the world of corruption with Yo-yos? That sounds like a cover for Sailor Moon.

Please continue this series pewds

Pewds finish the game

hey pewds

U Should craft frost armor and the storbow then u can easily kill the 3 mech boss the twins, destroyer,skeletron prime

Wow you got this in 0.67 chance 😲😲😲

Upload another episode of terraria or im subscribing to T. series

Pewds please

everyone is talking about this being the last terraria episode, but really im sad cuz it is the last thumbnail of his stinky face

Felix:*accidentally summons skeleton prime*<b>Everyone liked that</b>

bro so lucky to have 2 keys before even defeating a mech boss

Me: plays  100 hrs and never gets a hallowed keyPewds: plays for five minutes, kills one enemy and t drops it.

The old man is the clotheir

How did he get chlorophyte when he hasn&#39;t defeated the mech bosses yet?

6 months later and his 1.4 playthrough ended the exact same as this one; early hardmode, gathering titanium and failing to kill a mechanical boss.

keep going

I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DAMN LUCKY THIS MAN IS LIKE BRUH!!!!!!

I am Russian
and for money
brooooooo you putting killua when you said two yoyo&#39;s made me renew my faith in you.

You’re supposed to be all the mechanical bosses then defeat Planterra then you get all the keys turn into non-cursed keys then you can unlock really good chests then you defeat the golem from the jungle temple The last boss you battle is the moon lord

&quot;JOJO&quot;<b>Shows image of Killua</b>(Not a mean comment. just thought it was funny)

I also got the last prism

I got the best weapons on terraria plug it’s so cooooooool!!!!!!

How pirates summoned in softcore

I Can Imagine People That Don&#39;t Play Terrraria Acusing Him Of Using Creative Mode.

theres something called terraria wiki

Do more!!

Bring this back please

After I will complete game the last 5+ bosses excuse me

I cant watch terraria, I don&#39;t have money

who still play terraria in 2020

Joergen the Unicorn :D

there a easier way

Smash alters in the corruption to get titanium/admantite to spawn and get armour of them

i have nyan cat as my sword
You think your ritch? I got 15 platinum in EXPERT mode.. now Pewdiepie is the small pp

pls bring it baaaack

The skeleton is skeletron

He really said “let me find the sky island I will have beaten the game”

too bad that you need to join the channel for a series that was available to anybody

10% of comments “pewdiepie well done 90% of comments “pEwDiEpIe YoU DiDnT  cOmPlEtE tHe GaMe

<a href="">2:19</a>Les just blow up the CorruptionDemolitionist: <b>sniffles</b> &quot;you make me proud son&quot;

<a href="">6:53</a> is that Polnareff in Golden Wing?

It’s genuinely annoying, you left it like at 10% completion.

Bring this back

hey pewds if you take the witch doctor moves to the jungle and then at night he will sell wings :)

it hurts me that pewdiepie sounds like dio when he says jojo

Terraria reminds me of the escapists for some reason

you still haven&#39;t killed the plantera and the Golem , which is one of the hardest bosses in the game

Im almost triggered I can&#39;t watch the rest of the series

<a href="">7:23</a> Polnareff looking for his sister like:

i think he finds exploring and finding new things to be more interesting than fighting 50 bosses in a row, so i cant blame him for not wanting to continue, or feeling hes finished

clothier=old man

PewDiePie has gained more subs but has seemed to have dropped out of the public eye a bit, makes it way more calm

Use the clentaminator it&#39;s so useful and it will get rid of the corruption

Pewdiepie : I haven’t found sky cities I think after that I beat the gameEvery terraria pro : <b>laughing intensifies</b>

Haha, too bad you didnot know steampunk.

Owen ambrumsin
I always thought that the floating island was like beginning of the game that’s why the stuffs not good

Pewds defeats the wall of flesh in one try and gets out alive Also pewds: Dies in the middle of a pirafe invasion

YOU PROMISED BROU GOTTA DO ITOR A PHANTASAMAL DEATH RAY WILL SPANK YOU

Hey Felix here is something to do Terraria: The Terra Blade (Tutorial)Step 1: Craft Night&#39;s Edge Sword.Step 2: Make Excalibur from Hallowed Bars.Step 3: Make True Excalibur and True Night&#39;s Edge using one Broken Hero Sword each.Step 4: Combine True Excalibur with True Night&#39;s Edge to make a Terra Blade.

To beat the game you must kill the moon lord

Pls play again pewdie pie
Pewds “jojo” screen: hunter x hunter

Fight moonlord to end series

He gets excited for platinum when he doesnt care about cobalt

Do part 7&gt;:(
i can&#39;t afford to be a member :(

Next fight mech bosses
Pewdiepie: Did you know that I was riding this unicorn backwards?

go to the dungeon an find the hallowed chest

all of the keys for the chests are in the dungeon. In each biome there is a key and if you kill enough mobs you might get the key. It&#39;s a 1 in 10000 chance you will get one. I know im the 22,870th person commenting but I hope it helped!

Sucks to know that pewds still opens the door

you promised dont break it felix dont break that promise

Wouldnt it be funny if he ran into a wyvern

Weeee

wings

That character is a gay polnareff

bro that was the rayman soundtrack when he fought skeleprime

Btw, the beam sword is a 0.3 chance to drop from skeletons.

If by any chance your down to mod it, hit me up for some fire mods👁️👄👁️

ur not close to done

y is pewds doing every thing i did as soon as i got hardmode (leaf wings, unicorn.........)

U beat the game when u kill moon lord

Me, a terraria veteran watching him fight the hardest mechanical boss without titanium or adamantium armor:

Bruh guys he is already playing terraria journey&#39;s end.

You should do a Journey&#39;s end play through.

Beat the three mech bosses, make light discs, curse the old man to make him skeletron and kill him then explore the dungeon bellow and find the hollow chest for that one key, stay on the floating Island and wait for a wyvern to spawn so get souls of flight to make better wings, after the mech bosses go to the jungle and find a pink blub but don&#39;t break it it summons plantara so dig out and build an arena around it, after that kill it a few times it has a few good items, then you can open the big temple but first you wanna get three turtle shells by killing the big turtles in the jungle to make the the turtle  armor, then after that your gonna wanna make an above ground glowing mushroom biaom by putting a layer of two mud blocks to about 100 to 150 blocks stretched across the over world the then place a glowing mushroom seed on the mud and let it spread then bulid a suitable house there then get the mushroom spear, after all that then go to the temple and explore carefully there&#39;s a lot of traps but you can collect the traps for farms, collect all the lizhard cells to summon the gollem boss  then kill him a lot cuz he gives you one of the best pickaxes and beetle shells which can be used to make your turtle armor into beetle armor which will give you around 93 defense, then go to the new hard mode dungeon after those bosses

Impending doom is approaching

god if poods really gets hooked then imagine him playing calamity, i would absolutely love to watch

<a href="">4:38</a>: omg there’s a pirate moon walking that’s epic!!

It&#39;s in the dungeon all of your keys

I rlly want you to keep on playing terraria so here r some things that u need to do to complete the game 1.Defeat all mechanical bosses 2.defeat plantera in the jungle by looking for some plantera bulbs after u defeated the mec bosses 3.defeat golem in the jungle in the jungle temple 4.defeat duke fishron in the ocean biome by getting these special types of worm bait 5.defeat the alien invasion idk what it’s actually called or you could go straight to the lunatic cultus at the dungeon 5.defeat the 4 pillars sola nebula stardust and vortex 6.then finally defeat moonlord then u r done so i hope this helps and i hope you carry on with this series and play terraria with new update

Just a pro tip from a god once you kill wall of flesh up your almost half way done with the game.

Ufo uhh kill them they invade!😲<a href="">13:16</a>

OMG THE HALLOWED KEY IS A 1 IN 2500 DROP 0_0

From Ströheim
Some things you could do:Bosses-&gt; Eater of Worlds, Queen Slime, Destroyer, The Twins, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Empress of Light, Golem, Duke Fishron, Lunatic Cultist and Moon Lord.

Get adamantite or titanium and upgrade

Felix there is still ALOT to do considering i play terraria myself and i am already pretty far.But you still have to defeat: 3 mechanical bosses, plantera, the golem, the lunatic cultist and last but not least the moon lord. I still have to defeat the last two myself.

Looks like he&#39;s completed the game.

Pewdiepie, you have to play the new  update

Terraria now has star platinum loll

This shit ain’t fair. U NEED TO PAY TO BE ABLE TO WATCH MORE-

Wooooow, u just gonna end series when u haven’t even finished half the game

The reason his hair is flat: <a href="">11:54</a>

And the final boss in terraria is MOON LORD

The pirate invasion was a event not a bossWhen you reach 50% the flying Dutchman will come

<a href="">1:03</a> it really is my g (rip floyd)

bring this series back theres so much to do

Bring it back

Where is part 7?

I cannot wait for his reaction when he tries to finish the game and encounters the moonlordhe might be like &quot;WHAT THE +BLEEP+ IS THAT THING!?!?!?!?!?&quot;

Hey YouTube can Go to the donjon and Youse your jungle key

He cant stop the series because he has not beat the game yet lol

Imagine Felix playing in Master modeThe whole world would be a graveyard

Finish game
You know u can put coins in chests so u won&#39;t lose them everytime u die right....

ToDo:Get mythril pickaxe to mine adamantite/titaniumGet titanum/adamantite Repeater and armorFight Skeleron prime, the twins, destroyer, and if you find a gelatin crystal in  the underground hallow, queen slime aswellThen there&#39;s a bunch more of bosses but this avobe is enough  for like 4-6 episodes (3 or 2 if you do 3 mechs in 1 episode)

Get a full set of titanium/ Adamantite armor, and that should protect you more for the bosses, and try to get shadow flame knife (From hard mode goblin army)

Still waiting for The seventh part.

Come back father

Did anyone else get anxiety when he didnt pick up the turtle shell

How come you dont explore up on the sky, there are many chests with lots of new swords

PLAY IT

pewds go to the ocean and kill acuatic enemys as jellyfish and sharks, they can give u a treasure map, if u use it u will summon another pirates invasion, do this until the captain pirate drop u his sword, one of the best melee weapons pre planterra, it will be useful,  u have to kill the 3 mechanic bosses so they will give u a new ingot, the best ore of pre planterra, u will be able to do useful tools and weapons like the excalibur, then planterra bulbs will appear at the jungle and u will unlock a ore called chlorophyte (better than the ingots of the mechanic bosses, and create better things and armors with it)  , and if u destroy one planterra will summon, kill it so starts pre golem stage, but before u try this u will need to equip well, cos it will be difficult, its no so easy and there are 2 stages more, pre moon lord and post moon lord, with important events after and before.

pewds: what else is there to do Me: laughs in terrablade

Pewds pls bring this series back pls and also you don&#39;t take fall damage when your wearing wings actually.

Soon he will rise again

PLEASE CONTINUE

Bring this back for journeys end: newest update

Are we just going to ignore the fact that  pewdiepie made his character Polnareff

Pewdiepie you have the voice of flamingo

I cant take pewds seriously rn in the video when I&#39;m looking at him, he looks so immature compared to him with a beard

To stop the corruption use the clentamanator and use the ammo green solution all bought from the Steampunker and shoot the clentamanator at the corruption to turn it back to normal.

PewDiePie beaded Terraria me you are not even close to the endYou just started

If you make more terraria videos i will like every single one i promise

Keep up the terraria series!!!!! (After ur break lol)

How the heck did he have the hallow key already

i DoNT kNOw wHat To eVeN do AnyMoRE whhyyyyy has this series died you even said you liked the game

R.I.P he lost his save

You didnt beat the game! you need to beat the moon lord!

Please do more episodes of terraria

Go fight da moonlord, twins, skeleton, Duke fishron, destroyer or all the other ones😂

Pewds play more terraria

What happening to terrira

Please more

Play more

i love u, and i miss u, huuuuuuuuu, HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Can you play modded terraria?

and the way he cut off the corruption wasnt actually that bad to be fair.

at least pewds is trying.

Btw you need a mini shark&#39;s older brother  with ichor bullets the ichor will reduce their defense

HE GOT THE AMAROK AND THE ICE SICKLE AT THE FIRST DAY ?!, look at me, day 20 no yoyo, no ice sicklebruh

Did PEWDS defeated the ocram and the fishron?Plantera?Moon Lord?The Mods?

Seach up chippy gameing he dose a hardmode guide

The hollow key is for a hollow chest

Next you need to kill the mechanical bosses, Destroyer, The Twinz, Skeleton prime. after that the jungle starts spawning pink bulbs, you break those to beat plantera. once you kill plantera you kill golem in the jungle with the key from plantera, then you fight lunatic cultists at old man&#39;s dungeon. then kill him once thats done fight the celestial pillars kill those summon moon lord OP boss btw then kill him the kill Empress of light then you finished the game!

WHY YOU DONT USE YOUR ICE SIKLE!!!

Pewds: who knew pirates where richMe: everybody that&#39;s why they hide there treasurea

Pewdipie: i beat the gameMe: ????😀¿¿¿¿

Pewds: I AM DONE ONCE I FIND SKY THINGSDUDE YOU FORGOT LIKE 10 BOSSES YOU IS EVIL

Says that he thinks he’s done everything while wearing cobalt armor

Nurse is no longer immortal

He was a yo-yo master even back then

FINISH GAMe, ON CAMERA

Has he even beat a mechanical boss?

U still got so many bosses to do XP

I hope he knows what reforging is

<a href="">7:01</a> JOJO REFERENCE

WHAT HE IMMEDIATELY GOT A TURTLE SHELL

Tip: you should defeat The Twins, The Destroyer, and skeletron prime so that you could get the pickaxe axe and get the steampunker number one the pickaxe axe is the thing that could get that green thing that did not break or so called chlorophyt and the steampunker for the more efficient way to stop the corruption from spreading.

Now finish the game! Like if you agree

GUYS ITS OK HES BRINGING BACK THE SERIESHE SAID IT IN &quot;bye minecraft&quot; VIDEOso yessss
Plz bring series back
my guy really found chlorophyte and couldn&#39;t mine it but still thought he beat the game

ok felix, you need to mine some adamantite ore. its a red black color and you need like 300 of it so mine a lot the make a mechanical worm with 5 iron bars, six souls of night and 6 rotten chunks. then wait till night, summon it and use the nimbus rod you got and attack the probes it summons while your nimbus rod kills the boss.

Idk how to play this game

update came out a while now, hope he uploads Journeys end 3 new bosses. He didn&quot;t complete this world yet either :p

1.4&#39;s here bring it back aaahh

its been over 5 months and im still waiting for this series to continue

Me when I see a jojo reffrence: <a href="">2:10</a>

i recomend watching how to play series on youtube just please watch

I can’t wait for the series to come back

PewDiePie after that I should’ve eaten the entire game everybody who’s ever played Terraria I’m getting triggered there’s like 10 more bossis

No I want to see PewDiePie fight the Mac bosses that would be hilarious there’s no way he would win that fight if he struggled with the Flying Dutchman I’m almost at the moon lord and it’s almost impossible to kill it’s still hard for me to kill the Dmac bosses

felix you still arent even 20% in the game excluding calamity and other mods :D

It’s annoying that he randomly left this series alone 😔

You have to find plantera small rose like growing bulb randomly spawns in jungle you need a lot like a of space to fight

He put so much effort to the editing (or the brad did it) Rather than the minecraft. The conclusion is that he loved terraria, so sad he didn&#39;t make it to the end since 1.4 came out

PETITION TO REPEAT THE WHOLE SERIES AND PLAY THE MASTER MODE XD

Chill people .He will play terraria again when the update comes out .

BRING THE TERRARIA SERIES BACK PLS

moon lord is last boss

or happy days

watch chippy couch or chippy gaming

theres like 12more bosesslol

Wait till it says “tonight is going to be a terrible night.”

Bring the series back

he got 2 of the keys before knowing what a destroyer is

Bruh what happened? Part 5, he had hellstone armor and just defeated the wall of flesh and my dude just gets cobalt stuff out of nowhere.

Pewds, it&#39;s not unfair or cheating if you need to look on the wiki or anywhere online when you don&#39;t know where to go. You aren&#39;t even halfway through the game!

Plz do more
That moment when Pewds says he beat the game but still hasn’t even beat a mechanical boss: T_T

I rewatched this series after Pewds said he&#39;d bring this back. We may have to take a break from Minecraft, but we&#39;ll have a new and Fun series in Terraria!!

Why not you continue it :(

Pewds: *Gets hallowed key in less than 5 minutesMe: Impossible

where&#39;s part 7 lord pewds?:(

hey 1.4 is out now

Hey pewdie continue terraria please

Pewds Jouneys End is out can you please play?!?
