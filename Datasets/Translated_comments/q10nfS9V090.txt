Many people feel all the people are keralite

Kerala theory : Since there is a Kerala girl Nithya menon this history is true. (My experience)

Many people feel poor despite money. I did not understand. Now I feel rich.

Chandrayaan 3 deserves a movie too!!<a href="">2:38</a> Goosebumps!

Children should see this.

Yes, that&#39;s correct. Mars and Earth are at varying distances from each other as they orbit the Sun. Communication signals, which travel at the speed of light, take approximately 6 to 8 minutes to traverse the distance between the two planets. This time delay is known as the one-way signal travel time and is an important consideration for communication with Mars rovers, spacecraft, or future human missions.ChatGPT

What could be more motivating than this movie as a JEE aspirant. Proud to be indian

Most underrated movie in indian cinematic history

Anyone watching this after the launch of LVM3-M3 launch recently made by ISRO?

Bull shit movie:-Showing our scientists as cartoons and jokers, unnecessary religion discrimination and pseudo feminism, no proper code of conduct for a mission and many more....waste!!

Anyone here in 2023?

Russia And USA Just Contacted Modi To Get His Secret Technique For Going On Mars.

the fact that even Indian govt wasn&#39;t with them(just 400crores fund) but they still decided to make the impossible possible for the country&#39;s honour , made it even more touching .It just enraged me that the illiterate politicians spend crores on election campaigns, etc while our gems, riding broken scooters to work at ISRO ,are labelled as tax wasters if they fail.

This movie does not do justice for the situation, incidents feels like unrealistic.I understand womens must have played important role in the mission but this movie is showing like isro is being run by 90% womens Scientists are dancing &amp; cracking jokes Even a 20mins YouTube video can tell you more practical and scientific information than this movie.Only housewives who doesn&#39;t have much understanding about space and space missions will like this and get inspired from this movie. 

Everyone is saying about the story yes story is really amazing but also tell about the all actors and Akshay Kumar well done this movie makes me proud of my country  heads off India 

After seeing this movie I got to much motivation. Now my dream is to become an ISRO scientist

I love how ignorant these indians are being completely okay with the communal, anti hindu story of this movie. No wonder these Indians were invaded and made slaves for over 1000 years by arab islamic foreigners. The entire Muslim community would go rioting all over social media if in any way they were to show Muslims in a negative manner. Just have a look at these hindus and indians.

WORST FILM EVERI IN HISTORY OF SPACE FICTION FILM

I get crying in end when India go to mars

Keep on comments...who knows??? The secret of universe may be arround each one of us...use 100% of whatsapp...share your views about mars...this will help scientist to know our existance and end...

This move is really awesome. It&#39;s inspire you , and tell us about our ISRO scientists who have been working hard to explore space. We all  Indians feel proud on them. When we see their achievement it tell us -  We can achieve any thing if we have the passion and work hard to achieve it. We all know the history about ISRO how it started?

haha nice movie
It&#39;s an true inspiration. I literally got tears at the end. This is a must watch Ô∏è

Today I am watching mission mangal
Well Done India !  Accomplishing the mission is the priority, and you did it on your first try.  I wish you future success.  ISRO is better than CNSA!

Is there any human being on Mars?
Dekhne layaq to ye movie hai jo impossible ko possible karne ka jajba deti hai. Romance and love story to misguide karti hai.......

Very nice movie... Scientist job very tiring.... Hats off to them... We can never ever match them.... Look after family and work at the same time...... Real heroes.....

Yes this movie is a masterpiece but guys don&#39;t expect we will have all that cool technology stuff guys. Once the rocket is aboard, no one can control it. You have to determine trajectory and orbital mechanics for the whole flight well in advance. Pure mathematics and completely different from what we see in this movie.

Biggest motivational movie

Amazing film that shows the many ups and downs in everyone&#39;s life, including scientists&#39; and that HARDwork reaaaallllly pays. The way the rocket and satellite were made in Mangalyan mission is incredibly awesome!!!! India is the first country to reach Mars in the very first attempt:all thanks to the masterminds- the scientists. I watched this trailer today and had goosebumps and tears. Then, watched the movie today only and came back to comment.

Your pictures are hot in Bollywood and not in reality.
First of all this film is total waste of time and money, instead of this we should watch the real documentary which shows the real emotions and hard work of those scientist, This Akshay Kumar doesn&#39;t even know what it takes to be a scientist and the rest of them also. You guys didn&#39;t even showed heroes who did this work.Ever wonder why these movies doesn&#39;t win oscars because these guys show too much and playing a shitty rock music in the trailer.and lastly why they showed the quran scene in the movie which is absolutely nonsense....these guys are connecting mars with religion, Jagan Shakti you should concentrate on your dumb film.

Irrfan Khan had depth and all these people have Jihadi mentality and are fools.
This Akshay Kumar is a bastard, he has failed in tenth class, what is the temperament and style of conversation of a scientist, oh God, he is becoming and the director is an even bigger joke, you bitches are spreading Jihadi mentality everywhere, we can only get a documentary if it is bigger than this. You should have seen, Rakesh Dhawan is also a boorish director, he shows the country's people with vulgar scenes, you are singing rocking tunes even in intense movies, you bastards, Mr. Maan. You could have done 5% of Shivan ji's acting, but you have made parathas, what is acting? You have started imitating a space scientist, you have failed in 10th, you are a jihadi.
I want to be a big scientists for indian in future&#39;s sir

Truly an amazing film

Love Indian movies and I believe Indians are smart to do a mission like that with a budget like that.No doubt they are one of the smartest people ever

This movie inspired my daughter to become an ISRO scientist. When I asked her why she said, &quot; I want to serve my India like Tara Shinde , Rakesh Dhavan and all other scientists of Mars Orbiter Mission. I want to do the impossible. &quot; Really great movie !

Very inspiring flim

It was a great a movie but I feel that there where some errors in the movie. The launchpad shown in the movie looked more like Kenedy space centre than the one in Shriharikota. And they added to much bollywood masala to it, man. Like come on bollywood should stop putting item songs in Biopics, like &quot;dil mein Mars hai&quot;. No hate to the song but come on its a biopic. But ig overall it was a great movie, they could have done it even more better.

One of my most inspiring movie Ô∏è

I don&#39;t know why Bollywood is embarrassed of south India and dark skin. Based on real story but changed main character to north indian and show fair actor and actress with perfect figure. Not realistic at all. Consider Akshay Kumar&#39;s movies like airlift, padman, Mission mangal etc.  all south real life people are showed as north people in movie. It lives in fiction and portrays wrong image of India.

I seriously don&#39;t get who the hell are those disliking this

Awesome trailer

documentary made by national Geographic on isro is 100 time better then this movie......kam se kam film banane se pahle vo documentary hi dekh lete.....in documentary there is real scientists.. Who explain all about mars mission in scientific way.... But in Bollywood movies...stupid drama and meaningless  nonsense story is necessary..... Just take inspiration from Hollywood sci-fi movies... People also watch movies without songs. Before making sci-fi movie just study little bit . .

I am not an Indian...but still this movie made me proud..one of the best movie of bollywood..love from Bangladesh

1 actor akshay 4 actress 1 sonakshi 2 vidya 3 tapsee 4 kriti
Best movie I have ever seen I watched it nearly 10 times but still not get bored
It could be the masterpiece if makers don&#39;t wasted their time on showing scientist&#39;s personal life&#39;s.

This was a masterpiece

Sab acha he movie me, bas vo annoying sa mission mangalam remix baja baja k saari seriousness udadiya.....
Why u people casted Sonakshi Sinha

Ekta Kapoor was planning to take the up the story...thank god it didn&#39;t happen...she would have taken like another Nagin....lol

Dedicated to scientists of ISRO but changed their south Indian names to north Indian names. Namaskara Bollywood.

I literally cried at the end of the movie. This is a must watch

Movies may he fuck her less

You see why India went to Mars and Pakistan didn&#39;t? Because we have dreams to EXPLORE other planets, not EXPLODE other countries.

The One thing that never made sense in Movie was Nanda Shinde&#39;s Background Story. On One hand we see Nanda a Scientist who is Both a Rational Thinker &amp; a Devout at the Same time. But on another hand we see her Son who is so Ridiculously stupid that he decides to Change his Religion because A.R.Rehman did so. While A.R.Rehman Changed Religion for Spiritual Reasons, the Boy in the Movie thinks Changing Religion is a Pathway to &quot;Success&quot;. Hardwork, Determination &amp; Positivity, and not Changing Religion will guarantee Success.  We see movies to soothe &amp; Entertain our Minds not to be reminded of Disturbing/Controversial topics like &quot;Changing Religion&quot; (So why even Depict them in a Movie?) And the Movie Makers should have shown Nanda more Clearly &amp; Firmly explaining her son that &quot;Success can&#39;t be achieved only/just by Changing Religion&quot;

2.20 goosebumps

Mangalyaan project cost is 450 crore rs ... This movie revenue is around 300 crore just like that.. I think movie team should share atleast 10% of the profit with ISRO

Amazing work based on scientific theme involving interplanetary mission. Quite a performance from akshay and Co.Beautiful direction story is quite involving and motivational. Lacking some good vfx effects and 3d effects but gud work as per budget. Best for kids. Loved it very much.

Best motivational movie

Ye picture acchi hai...par isme beech beech me aisa dikhaya gaya hai muslim  me convert hona is not a big deal, neha Siddiqui character represents that love jihad is just a myth. Eka Gandhi represents that sleeping with random person is ok. Akshay Kumar shown as athiest. I mean what was wrong with director. Picture banaa raha tha yaa propaganda phela raha tha.

what an incredible movie it is ,indeed.Go and watch .

Sonakshi:-After that I will go to NASA. Me:-First go and read Ramayan.
I think most of the names in the movie mostly related to north indian names actually most of them are south indians don&#39;t want to discriminate between them but they may be compromised because it&#39;s a bollywood film

hi

what's the matter
The movie is awesome. I wanna be in isro or NASA. Working on that being in USA. This movie gave me goosebumps seriously.

In gslv it was written sro

I kindly request the makers of mission Mangal to put this film on Netflix or amazon prime, and people who agree with me and want this thing to happen then please hit the like button on my comment and as well as on this video.

Too good...

Best good movie
Move

Movie bahut acche thi.par is movie ke  lead role me kisi Indian ko hona chahiye tha Canadian ko nahi. Akshay doesn&#39;t deserve this movie . He earns a lot of money through fake deshbhakti emotional drama and he has decided to go to Canada after retirement from bollywood.shame on you Akshay and on all the Indian fans of this Canadian. Jai Hind .

Why does this movie oil Muslims?  Why did this movie show that a boy of a hindu family reading quran and a women not having a room for rent being a Muslim? It also showed a great scientist of india having not faith in prayer.    Why is bollywood doing this? Why is bollywood hindu phobic and why is it oil Muslim?

even a little
Who likes this film and it becomes a hit?
Which is best movie Super 30 -  Like Mission mangal = comment Dekhte hai konsi movie kisko zyada pasand aayi

trailor main he poori movie thi

I am wonder Akshay is a Canadian citizen but not anti national and those who are working for india saying, doing for india are anti national according to modi bhakht...what if Srk, Salman did same thing liked Akshay everybody will criticize anti national ..lol modi rss desh bhakht

Finally Bollywood has something noble for  children

waw very hard mission mangal
kabir‚ô°
the cooking theory scene is similar to in the habibie&#39;s movie from indonesia

Ishi

i saw the movie and   i still dont see the resemblence between the puri and  the  orbital  ocillation technique  does the  producer or director think the public are idiots .   in which case the cheap vfx of the rocket and  orbit justifies .   ( i believe the real people who were responsible for the mangal mission  cant stop laughing  ). the movie itself looks like a 90s movie  excluding akshayji&#39;s  audi .   anyone else  who  denies my  comment plz watch  armageddon  its an old flim but  way better then this

I&#39;ll never watch this movie bcoz of sona

Mission Mangal. Super Best

Who will tell when the movie will be shown in the hall?
Nahi why they wasted 800 crores, in India so many city&#39;s are there, there is no fly over to cross the road, instead of wasting 800 crores, build fly over in all city&#39;s, people are not able to cross the roads, and what&#39;s there in NASA, feed poor people atleast u can spend 2 crores for this.

Reality ma pohanch skty nhi isliye indians Film ma hi pohanch gay MARS ; )

Bidya, we love you Ô∏è
Haha Jane's dream on the moon
Saaho 400 crores to make shit movie non sense and isro 400 crores to reach mars hats off and everyone slap the director of sahoo

I will must watch this movie

Chand par pouchy nahi mass jaye gy

It&#39;s no use of all these missions spending a large number of money on the other hand people are lacking of the food , roads etc .

Watched today this movie...I must appreciate the whole team of ISRO for their wonderful efforts for their mission to mars in reality also and no doubt the whole movie is fantastic.... From Pakistan....Ô∏èÔ∏è

Director Jagan Shakti keeps his ambitions‚Äîand the space mission story arcs‚Äîlight and digestible. It&#39;s entertaining for sure, but could he have aimed higher?  Read the review here: <a href="">

Mission Mangal Superrbbb Movie 
It looks like the Hollywood movie &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;.......

Indian movies need to step up their game for science fiction movies yaar. We want something thats not too over the top and actually focuses on the theme.

low-quality animations and vfx . bollywood needs to start doing some good quality animations like interstellar and all.

Movie ka link send please

Good story but terrible movie.

Rohit yadav ji
I loved movie but 1 thing hurts me a lot is AK says Tambi..vaada in Bangalore ISRO.its not necessary to use or portray Tamil atleast when you say it in Bangalore Isro.Also No freedom given to Veteran Kannada actor Dattatreya to speak in Kannada. Why he should talk in Hindi at home with his wife..Don&#39;t know..So in natural..South India is not equal to Madarasis.AK has acted in Sandalwood Kannada movies before he was star..Why Bollywood portray always south Indians as Tamils.Already In Mumbai ...dominated with Hindi..Over Marathi...Request Bollywood to distinguish different language ..Culture of South Indian states..Agree or Disagree..

I am kannadiga  what a movie I got inspiration
