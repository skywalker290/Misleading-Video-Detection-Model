2 propaganda’s have been detected in this movie against hindu 1) Hindu boy loves to read Quran being a fan of So called converted AR Rehman eventually boy father doesn’t like this but mother supports him2) Muslim scientist has struggle in finding rented home Why this fucking propogendas require in this scientific movie and why chuslam need to over exaggerated without any reason

Many people feel all the people are keralite

Kerala theory : Since there is a Kerala girl Nithya menon this history is true. (My experience)

Many people feel poor despite money. I did not understand. Now I feel rich.

Chandrayaan 3 deserves a movie too!!<a href="">2:38</a> Goosebumps!

Children should see this.

Yes, that&#39;s correct. Mars and Earth are at varying distances from each other as they orbit the Sun. Communication signals, which travel at the speed of light, take approximately 6 to 8 minutes to traverse the distance between the two planets. This time delay is known as the one-way signal travel time and is an important consideration for communication with Mars rovers, spacecraft, or future human missions.ChatGPT 

Good

What could be more motivating than this movie as a JEE aspirant. Proud to be indian

Most underrated movie in indian cinematic history

Anyone watching this after the launch of LVM3-M3 launch recently made by ISRO?

Bull shit movie:-Showing our scientists as cartoons and jokers, unnecessary religion discrimination and pseudo feminism, no proper code of conduct for a mission and many more....waste!!

Anyone here in 2023?

Russia And USA Just Contacted Modi To Get His Secret Technique For Going On Mars.

the fact that even Indian govt wasn&#39;t with them(just 400crores fund) but they still decided to make the impossible possible for the country&#39;s honour , made it even more touching .It just enraged me that the illiterate politicians spend crores on election campaigns, etc while our gems, riding broken scooters to work at ISRO ,are labelled as tax wasters if they fail.

This movie does not do justice for the situation, incidents feels like unrealistic.I understand womens must have played important role in the mission but this movie is showing like isro is being run by 90% womens Scientists are dancing &amp; cracking jokes Even a 20mins YouTube video can tell you more practical and scientific information than this movie.Only housewives who doesn&#39;t have much understanding about space and space missions will like this and get inspired from this movie. 

Everyone is saying about the story yes story is really amazing but also tell about the all actors and Akshay Kumar well done this movie makes me proud of my country  heads off India 

After seeing this movie I got to much motivation. Now my dream is to become an ISRO scientist

I love how ignorant these indians are being completely okay with the communal, anti hindu story of this movie. No wonder these Indians were invaded and made slaves for over 1000 years by arab islamic foreigners. The entire Muslim community would go rioting all over social media if in any way they were to show Muslims in a negative manner. Just have a look at these hindus and indians.

Bestttttt movie...if at all we can call it bestest then I would love to.I don&#39;t think Indian cinema could have made a better movie than this.Vidya Balan, Akshay Kumar and the entire team.... performance was <a href="">brilliant.You</a> should come up with more such movies with the same cast.Loved the movie..can&#39;t stop applauding the direction.And above all always proud to be an Indian.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

WORST FILM EVERI IN HISTORY OF SPACE FICTION FILM

I get crying in end when India go to mars

Keep on comments...who knows??? The secret of universe may be arround each one of us...use 100% of whatsapp...share your views about mars...this will help scientist to know our existance and end...

This move is really awesome. It&#39;s inspire you , and tell us about our ISRO scientists who have been working hard to explore space. We all  Indians feel proud on them. When we see their achievement it tell us -  We can achieve any thing if we have the passion and work hard to achieve it. We all know the history about ISRO how it started?

haha nice movie
It&#39;s an true inspiration. I literally got tears at the end. This is a must watch ️

Today I am watching mission mangal
Well Done India !  Accomplishing the mission is the priority, and you did it on your first try.  I wish you future success.  ISRO is better than CNSA!

Is there any human being on Mars?
Dekhne layaq to ye movie hai jo impossible ko possible karne ka jajba deti hai. Romance and love story to misguide karti hai.......

Very nice movie... Scientist job very tiring.... Hats off to them... We can never ever match them.... Look after family and work at the same time...... Real heroes..... 

I actually cried when I saw the ending of this movie

It&#39;s really great movie 

One of the best movie. I loved it a lot watched film around 100 times. Lots love and respect to our scientists 

Yes this movie is a masterpiece but guys don&#39;t expect we will have all that cool technology stuff guys. Once the rocket is aboard, no one can control it. You have to determine trajectory and orbital mechanics for the whole flight well in advance. Pure mathematics and completely different from what we see in this movie.

It was an epic moments for our whole country...Congratulations to ISRO 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳     🇮🇳       🇮🇳            🇮🇳    🇮🇳   🇮🇳    🇮🇳     🇮🇳       🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳       🇮🇳     🇮🇳     🇮🇳                🇮🇳   🇮🇳    🇮🇳   🇮🇳     🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🇮🇳     🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

Such an amazing movie...one of the best movies i&#39;ve ever seen in my life...

Clad in sarees, who will ever believe that they can work in ISRO as scientists? Salute those women who makes every Indian woman to be proud and stand tall with our culture.

Goosebumps guaranteed

If this is a Hollywood film: we show greatness of scientists and engineers and rise of isro But in bollywood: we don&#39;t care if they are great or not we just want to force patriotism and force on one point that just india is great.

Officer:- Where will you get 800 cr.Le Akshay:- I have a scheme, money will double in 25 days.
Biggest motivational movie

Amazing film that shows the many ups and downs in everyone&#39;s life, including scientists&#39; and that HARDwork reaaaallllly pays. The way the rocket and satellite were made in Mangalyan mission is incredibly awesome!!!! India is the first country to reach Mars in the very first attempt:all thanks to the masterminds- the scientists. I watched this trailer today and had goosebumps and tears. Then, watched the movie today only and came back to comment.

Your pictures are hot in Bollywood and not in reality.
First of all this film is total waste of time and money, instead of this we should watch the real documentary which shows the real emotions and hard work of those scientist, This Akshay Kumar doesn&#39;t even know what it takes to be a scientist and the rest of them also. You guys didn&#39;t even showed heroes who did this work.Ever wonder why these movies doesn&#39;t win oscars because these guys show too much and playing a shitty rock music in the trailer.and lastly why they showed the quran scene in the movie which is absolutely nonsense....these guys are connecting mars with religion, Jagan Shakti you should concentrate on your dumb film.

Irrfan Khan had depth and all these people have Jihadi mentality and are fools.
This Akshay Kumar is a bastard, he has failed in tenth class, what is the temperament and style of conversation of a scientist, oh God, he is becoming and the director is an even bigger joke, you bitches are spreading Jihadi mentality everywhere, we can only get a documentary if it is bigger than this. You should have seen, Rakesh Dhawan is also a boorish director, he shows the country's people with vulgar scenes, you are singing rocking tunes even in intense movies, you bastards, Mr. Maan. You could have done 5% of Shivan ji's acting, but you have made parathas, what is acting? You have started imitating a space scientist, you have failed in 10th, you are a jihadi.
I want to be a big scientists for indian in future&#39;s sir

Nice

Truly an amazing film

Love Indian movies and I believe Indians are smart to do a mission like that with a budget like that.No doubt they are one of the smartest people ever

This movie inspired my daughter to become an ISRO scientist. When I asked her why she said, &quot; I want to serve my India like Tara Shinde , Rakesh Dhavan and all other scientists of Mars Orbiter Mission. I want to do the impossible. &quot; Really great movie !

Very inspiring flim 
isro budget = 70 million dollars  Falcon 9 cost = 60 million loland by the way, falcon 9 is a privately own rocket and way stronger than gslv India&#39;s strongest rocket

Officer: Where will you get 800 croresAkshay Kumar: I have a scheme to double your money in 25 days.
It was a great a movie but I feel that there where some errors in the movie. The launchpad shown in the movie looked more like Kenedy space centre than the one in Shriharikota. And they added to much bollywood masala to it, man. Like come on bollywood should stop putting item songs in Biopics, like &quot;dil mein Mars hai&quot;. No hate to the song but come on its a biopic. But ig overall it was a great movie, they could have done it even more better.

I also got tears in end of movieand felt shame on myself what i had have ever done anything for my country, i asked it to myself️️️️️️️️️️️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

One of my most inspiring movie ️

I don&#39;t know why Bollywood is embarrassed of south India and dark skin. Based on real story but changed main character to north indian and show fair actor and actress with perfect figure. Not realistic at all. Consider Akshay Kumar&#39;s movies like airlift, padman, Mission mangal etc.  all south real life people are showed as north people in movie. It lives in fiction and portrays wrong image of India.

I seriously don&#39;t get who the hell are those disliking this

documentary made by national Geographic on isro is 100 time better then this movie......kam se kam film banane se pahle vo documentary hi dekh lete.....in documentary there is real scientists.. Who explain all about mars mission in scientific way.... But in Bollywood movies...stupid drama and meaningless  nonsense story is necessary..... Just take inspiration from Hollywood sci-fi movies... People also watch movies without songs. Before making sci-fi movie just study little bit . .

The One thing that never made sense in Movie was Nanda Shinde&#39;s Background Story. On One hand we see Nanda a Scientist who is Both a Rational Thinker &amp; a Devout at the Same time. But on another hand we see her Son who is so Ridiculously stupid that he decides to Change his Religion because A.R.Rehman did so. While A.R.Rehman Changed Religion for Spiritual Reasons, the Boy in the Movie thinks Changing Religion is a Pathway to &quot;Success&quot;. Hardwork, Determination &amp; Positivity, and not Changing Religion will guarantee Success.  We see movies to soothe &amp; Entertain our Minds not to be reminded of Disturbing/Controversial topics like &quot;Changing Religion&quot; (So why even Depict them in a Movie?) And the Movie Makers should have shown Nanda more Clearly &amp; Firmly explaining her son that &quot;Success can&#39;t be achieved only/just by Changing Religion&quot;

Only India can do such unique work…I believe that India will be the first to release the corona virus vaccine.
I watch the movie only for akshay n nitya Menon

Iam big fan of rakesh and his team

superb

Goosebumps after watching this movie

Amazing work based on scientific theme involving interplanetary mission. Quite a performance from akshay and Co.Beautiful direction story is quite involving and motivational. Lacking some good vfx effects and 3d effects but gud work as per budget. Best for kids. Loved it very much.

That is Akshay Kumar .. Only for Akshay Kumar&#39;s Fans

Love that VANDE MATRAM tone..️ <a href="">#Jai</a> Hind🇮🇳🇮🇳 <a href="">#Akshay</a> sir u r the star of India.

This movie has not been seen but has also been taught very little.
Mission mangle is very very good and motivational movie and I like all A.k B.B all teamand seluet to all off reel and real hero&#39;s 

Best motivational movie

Ye picture acchi hai...par isme beech beech me aisa dikhaya gaya hai muslim  me convert hona is not a big deal, neha Siddiqui character represents that love jihad is just a myth. Eka Gandhi represents that sleeping with random person is ok. Akshay Kumar shown as athiest. I mean what was wrong with director. Picture banaa raha tha yaa propaganda phela raha tha.

what an incredible movie it is ,indeed.Go and watch .

I am 11years old

Sonakshi:-After that I will go to NASA. Me:-First go and read Ramayan.
I think most of the names in the movie mostly related to north indian names actually most of them are south indians don&#39;t want to discriminate between them but they may be compromised because it&#39;s a bollywood film

Nice to see only fair skinned actors and actresses being selected. Totally Indian.

hi

what's the matter
The movie is awesome. I wanna be in isro or NASA. Working on that being in USA. This movie gave me goosebumps seriously.

In gslv it was written sro

I kindly request the makers of mission Mangal to put this film on Netflix or amazon prime, and people who agree with me and want this thing to happen then please hit the like button on my comment and as well as on this video.

Too good...

Best good movie
Move

Movie bahut acche thi.par is movie ke  lead role me kisi Indian ko hona chahiye tha Canadian ko nahi. Akshay doesn&#39;t deserve this movie . He earns a lot of money through fake deshbhakti emotional drama and he has decided to go to Canada after retirement from bollywood.shame on you Akshay and on all the Indian fans of this Canadian. Jai Hind .

Great movie !!Btw can someone tell what akshay kumar is humming when gslv fails?

<a href="">0:52</a>
Amitabh bacchan sir, Hrithik roshan and akshay Kumar these three are greatest actor of all time in film Industry.

OSM movie ruled by meJai hind🇮🇳Jai brahat🇮🇳Meh bhi kuch kar huuu 
Why does this movie oil Muslims?  Why did this movie show that a boy of a hindu family reading quran and a women not having a room for rent being a Muslim? It also showed a great scientist of india having not faith in prayer.    Why is bollywood doing this? Why is bollywood hindu phobic and why is it oil Muslim?

even a little
Who likes this film and it becomes a hit?
Which is best movie Super 30 -  Like Mission mangal = comment Dekhte hai konsi movie kisko zyada pasand aayi

trailor main he poori movie thi

I am wonder Akshay is a Canadian citizen but not anti national and those who are working for india saying, doing for india are anti national according to modi bhakht...what if Srk, Salman did same thing liked Akshay everybody will criticize anti national ..lol modi rss desh bhakht

Did you dislike this video??

Wow great uploads...dear

couldn&#39;t they instead make a movie about NASA or SpaceX??? They deserve it better

Finally Bollywood has something noble for  children

waw very hard mission mangal
kabir♡
the cooking theory scene is similar to in the habibie&#39;s movie from indonesia

Ishi

i saw the movie and   i still dont see the resemblence between the puri and  the  orbital  ocillation technique  does the  producer or director think the public are idiots .   in which case the cheap vfx of the rocket and  orbit justifies .   ( i believe the real people who were responsible for the mangal mission  cant stop laughing  ). the movie itself looks like a 90s movie  excluding akshayji&#39;s  audi .   anyone else  who  denies my  comment plz watch  armageddon  its an old flim but  way better then this

I&#39;ll never watch this movie bcoz of sona

Mission Mangal. Super Best
Jin ka chandriyan  do bar fail ho jay for mars pr jany ki movie bna rahy hain wah clapping

Mission mangal is better than War Hit like if u agree

Feeling proud to be Hindustani

Ye nithya, thodi thodi Kiara jaisee lgti h....

yoy

Which movie is better Mission mangal : like Batla house : comment

I am waiting for this movie

best movie

Bobal amaging

Who will tell when the movie will be shown in the hall?
Nahi why they wasted 800 crores, in India so many city&#39;s are there, there is no fly over to cross the road, instead of wasting 800 crores, build fly over in all city&#39;s, people are not able to cross the roads, and what&#39;s there in NASA, feed poor people atleast u can spend 2 crores for this.

Reality ma pohanch skty nhi isliye indians Film ma hi pohanch gay MARS ; )

Bidya, we love you ️
Haha Jane's dream on the moon
Saaho 400 crores to make shit movie non sense and isro 400 crores to reach mars hats off and everyone slap the director of sahoo

I am here after watch this brilliant movie and I am proudfull of being an Indian🇮🇳 and proud to isroAnd i am thankfull to akshay sir for making these types of masterpieces

I will must watch this movie

Chand par pouchy nahi mass jaye gy

It&#39;s no use of all these missions spending a large number of money on the other hand people are lacking of the food , roads etc .

Watched today this movie...I must appreciate the whole team of ISRO for their wonderful efforts for their mission to mars in reality also and no doubt the whole movie is fantastic.... From Pakistan....️️

Director Jagan Shakti keeps his ambitions—and the space mission story arcs—light and digestible. It&#39;s entertaining for sure, but could he have aimed higher?  Read the review here: <a href="">

Jb movie dikhate he nhi ho to q add dete ho

Hahahahahahahaha Busss India, only he can star in his film for real but he is flopping, isn't he?
If you react on YouTube then you will react hota

This hero makes me happy
Movie ke nameper clip dikhata he bhenchodh   day

Apart from India&#39;s dedication to space science this movie can teach us countless lessons of life. I wish to see my neighbour country India flourish, and that success should be the only fight Between us. Let&#39;s create more space rockets instead of missiles. May both neighbours live and prosper happily forever. LOVE FROM PAKISTAN. REMEMBER THIS ALL 🇵🇰️🇮🇳

Motherchod  rendian begger

Mission Mangal Superrbbb Movie 
It looks like the Hollywood movie &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;.......

Indian movies need to step up their game for science fiction movies yaar. We want something thats not too over the top and actually focuses on the theme.

low-quality animations and vfx . bollywood needs to start doing some good quality animations like interstellar and all.

Movie ka link send please

Nice indanc
Akshay ji y&#39;all movie hit jay
Great movie and inspiring

i m a very lucky

Superstar Superman jahuruddin
Good story but terrible movie.

Rohit yadav ji
I loved movie but 1 thing hurts me a lot is AK says Tambi..vaada in Bangalore ISRO.its not necessary to use or portray Tamil atleast when you say it in Bangalore Isro.Also No freedom given to Veteran Kannada actor Dattatreya to speak in Kannada. Why he should talk in Hindi at home with his wife..Don&#39;t know..So in natural..South India is not equal to Madarasis.AK has acted in Sandalwood Kannada movies before he was star..Why Bollywood portray always south Indians as Tamils.Already In Mumbai ...dominated with Hindi..Over Marathi...Request Bollywood to distinguish different language ..Culture of South Indian states..Agree or Disagree..

I am kannadiga  what a movie I got inspiration

Mere cainal ko suscribe please

Hahhaahhaha bohsri Waly chand tak to gaye nh mars per jaeingy
