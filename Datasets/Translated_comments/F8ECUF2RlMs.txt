Nawazuddin Siddiqui is world&#39;s best actor 

Nawaz bhai your good
Alia Bhatt ki jagah aise star ki movie dekhiye jo really talented hai

<a href="">2:12</a> <b>Vasudha wearing red dress in shot killed Raghuveer Singh</b>

Both are fine actors,

The most talented actor Much better than budda’s - shahrukh khan, salman khan, amir khan(nepotism)Its time to bycott all budhaa’ssss

Nawaz sir n radhika just mind blowing

Classic voice and acting: nawajuddin siddhiqiBest facial expression and deep acting : pankaj tripathiBest acting and comedy : manoj bajpeyiThis three valuable stone of industry who deserve oscar

Good actor, lucky he got chance to prove himself... there are huge talent pool, who will prove far better if they will get their dues honestly.

<a href="">

i hope you guys would be able to find more actors like Nawaz....

Download and watch the movie from Menefilla.
I have seen the movie. It is a great movie.Every characters have done great jobSpecially nawaz and radhika.I will recommend to watch this

Everyone is getting a little emotional, Nawaz sir: Hey...look, it's going on 
I don&#39;t get it  . Does Nawazuddin selects good scripts or the script becomes better after Nawazuddin enters....????

Are you brother please upload the full movie and it will remain true.
Probably one of the best thrillers

Yadav is complicated
Great movie loved it!! I have already watched it twice!!! Nawazuddin was great!! These dumb nepotism kids couldn’t do 1 second of his acting!!!! The sheer talent in his acting was phenomenal!!!!!

I have to see where I will meet.
Great moviereal talent 
Everyone is getting more emotional...Nawaz: hah2 watching ???
Great movie! Saw it yesterday. Remarkable performances! Superlative execution of the story.  I have pledged to appreciate good movies, especially by outsiders. Don&#39;t want any more Sushant like situation.i regret his loss.

I love the way he talks

I didn&#39;t understand one thing. When the girl killed him... The light was there... But vikram had called him just after the light was gone. How did Raghu beer talk to him? then?

Amazing Nawaz
Movie was gud, however I felt that songs at the end were totally unnecessary. Movie length could be shortened by 20min. Suspense was revealed just like that in one go, in a very ordinary way. Apart from these things, Everything was perfect.

<a href="">3:47</a> nice painting on the wall

Upload full movie

Gail nhi h movie main ️
Along with me is Sardar Khan's assistant.
Very rubbish and boring film.
Best suspense thriller of 2020 nawazuddin sir delivered Oscar winning performance 
He Natrual actor and awesome one .

Nawaazu Di..The real Talent
Unpopular opinion but what a crap movie only thing good about it is the acting of two lead actors.

Whenever Nawaz plays Gangster or the opposite Police....Any movie or series is a must watch....At least for him

Story:A girl kill her uncle as he had abused her when she was a minor. Pathetic 2hrs+ shitty film.Don&#39;t watch it.Nothing new.

must watch ...i didn’t cook, clean or do anything ...just sat and watched in my bedroom ...fantastic ...also loved that Nawazuddin sir took on a different police persona than the one he exhibited in Kahaani. he is a clever actor. radhika was a vision ...just incredible to watch her portray a range of emotions and expressions.

Fantastic movie....

I&#39;ve done it ,well Intersting End

Yadav ji
It&#39;s an intriguing movie. Radhika and Nawazuddin are best but I would like to appreciate ila Arun and Tigmanshu for their fabulous performance. Each and every cast member has nailed it with their acting.

Just watched this... it&#39;s a below average movie. Investigation of the crime is really pathetic. Climax was okay.

Just watched it. Not an interesting movie.below average.good acting with faltu story.

Great...aachha banaya achhi story....and rest of nawaz to hai hi.....must watch
FIRST TIME proud of the audience ab Maja ayega we have to boycott every starkid movie annanya Sara jhanvi everyone and don&#39;t worry about the outsiders involved in the movie if audience dekhegi nai movie toh outsiders k sath outsiders ko hi lenge <a href="">#justice</a> <a href="">#proudindia</a> <a href="">#youth</a>

Fucking beauty!!Hopefully people will now start watching the better films..

Amazing script all credit goes to writer and director ..Nawauddin Sadiqui is really amzing as always he is legend no one can beat his acting skills

Background music in this movie was too loud. It was difficult to hear the dialogue.

I dint find this movie gripping and edge of the seat mystery. I&#39;ve finished watching it in three days time.

Netflix can do an entire series on Inspector Jatil Yadav. People will love it!!

Copy of knives out.

I saw twice, its a ️️️️️
To watch this movie, there is no need to watch any review...
Lack of directionThe man in front of nawaz on Stairs is showing high status than nawaz <a href="">01:56</a>

18+ seen to nhi h na ?Family ke sath dekhe skte h ?

Seems it is worth.. watching

<a href="">

Loved this film ️

Super Hero
Loved the movie!

The ambience of the movie is superb. Casting and acting of each cast is perfect.

It felt like reading an Agatha Christie novel.
Isn&#39;t this a copy of Knives Out?

The story is simple... Where &quot; Child Abuse and Tarak pan... Jatin's name, his mother wrote Jatil in the form..
Look like knives out

Seems like copy of Knives Out.

People showing off after watching the movie downloaded from telegram

Just nailed it

This is actually worst movie of Nawaz Siddiqui&#39;s entire career. Worst movie of 2020. Every talented actor got Wasted in this movie. Climax is so pathetic. I don&#39;t understand those people mentality Who thinks this is great job. Are You guys dumb?? Not every dark movie is good. If you want to see Dark suspense thriller, go and watch Manorama 6 feet under, Kahaani, Talaash again

Best..<a href="">

Worst

I came to see radhika apte nd shweta tripathi

Brilliant Neo-Noir Movie. A big fan of this genre. Interesting that Netflix India has put up this small segment, as one can figure out the murderer by looking closely at the expressions of the performer who is playing that role. I would advise everyone to try it out once they&#39;ve seen the movie. Nevertheless, the explanation was top notch and very difficult to figure out. Keep making such awesome movies :)

Why does this Radhika look at you like Marwan?
<a href="">03:37</a> actual acting tallent of nawaz sir, we love you sir, sach me kabhi kabhi lagata hai aaphi iss industrie ke bhagawan hai. Hatts of to your acting sir.

Budhiya is acting very well. Jabardast

Jatil yadav is terrific yo

Netflix is the best

The movie is very intense, tricky portion comes at the end only , you need to be very patient during watching this movie or you are going to feel bored.

By the trailor it seems interesting. Thanks Netflix India for giving us quality choices

Your mother kept changing the name of Jatin to Jatil Yadav.
So many subtle messages. A very good movie. 
Just finished watching it, awesome movie. Acting was brilliant from the whole cast and love the multilayered story of a whodunnit movie.

Looks like a desi version of Knives Out.
I watched it .. I didn&#39;t find the story any new or interesting.. rest acting is as usual very good

<a href="">0:45</a> Salil Jamdar lite found
Who else think Ramesh chauhan&#39;s was played by Tigmanshu dhulia not this man..

Brilliant piece of art. 

Nawaz looks sharper than ever.his acting skills were great before.but now it is beyond the world.reminds me of amir khan.sooo eager to see this movieeee

Top class movie 
So dark so good

Radhika apte
You all tell us one thing, what has happened, we will check whom to keep inside, whom to throw out, this is our life...love Nawaz Bhai...signature style
First see the knives out...
Such a brilliant movie... No one not even one of the actors miss a beat... We have such sheer talent in our country in terms of direction and story writing... Must watch!!!

Shandar jabarjast zindabaad...... Love u Nawajuddin Siddiqui......
Knives out

Just got done watching this. This film is absolutely brilliant. Every cast member is perfect and the writing is impeccable. Its not just a regular thriller, it deals with so many issues that our society regularly deals with, effectively. Nothing like Knives Out in any way (+this finished shooting before knives out released). Loved it. Keep it up Netflix. Radhika is your lucky charm.

Hey guys! I know this is a wrong place maybe but i need ur support....Really. I make some cinema based contents and post it on insta and fb....on insta @society_onscreen you can find it out.... It&#39;s Good....plzzz your support can boost me up and help me grow my content further....

This seems to be taken out of the movie &quot;Knives Out&quot;, which was a brilliant movie. Do watch that, and you can tell the striking similarity. I might be wrong, since this is just a sneak-peek!!

 real reason  Link  NEED SUPPORT .  .  .  
The question is not WHO? But WHEN he got killed.

This film is very good
another hit by nawaz bhai

 best Mystery Hollywood movies

Nawazuddin's first 7-minute sneak peek into our life. Now the real meat has started.
Adityasrivastav Sir

Nice

Superb

Knives out Like this

Smashing the walls of Patriarchy with some Indian Tadka, must watch thriller influenced post this review <a href="">

Actor is famous but picture is useless
Watched it last night.. And to be very honest.. Post the demise of one of my heroes Irrfan.. I had one thing in my mind that any one who could come closer to him is Nawaz and he proved it through this movie.. For me one of the finest performances by Nawaz.. Rest of the star cast also performed quite well.. A gripping film that is a tight slap on the face of cruel and heartless patriarchal society that is still prevalent in some parts of our country..

tamil dubb available
I left a zoom class after getting a netflix notification
