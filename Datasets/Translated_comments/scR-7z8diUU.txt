No one can sing like him

Oh!
Fonsi, DY

Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah

It's alive, it's alive Daddy
Go!



Yes, you know I've been looking at you for a while now
I have to dance with you today (DY)
I saw that your gaze was already calling me
Show me the way that I'm going


Oh, you, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I'm getting closer and putting together the plan
Just thinking about it makes your pulse accelerate (oh yeah)


Yes, I like you more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any rush


Despacito

I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So that you remember if you are not with me
Despacito

I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript (up, up, up)
(Sube, sube) Oh



I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm (uh oh, uh oh)
That you show my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorites, favorites baby)
Let me get over your danger zones (uh oh, uh oh)
Until I provoke your screams (uh oh, uh oh)
And may you forget your last name (dirididi Daddy)


(DY) If I ask you for a kiss, come give it to me (eh)
I know you're thinking about it (eh)
I've been trying for a while (eh)
Mommy, this is giving and giving
You know your heart with me makes you bam bam
You know this drink is looking for me bam bam
Come taste my mouth to see how it tastes to you
I want, I want, I want to see how much love you have
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start' slow then wild


Step by step, soft little
We are going to stick a little bit
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, soft little
We are getting closer, little by little (oh oh)
And that beauty is a puzzle (oh no)
But pa&#39; put it together here I have the piece (slow, oh yeah)


Slowly (yeh, me)
I want to breathe your neck slowly (me)
Let me say things in your ear (me)
So that you remember if you are not with me
Despacito

I want to undress you with kisses slowly (yeh)
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript (up, up, up)
(Sube, sube) Oh



I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm (uh oh, uh oh)
That you show my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorites, favorites baby)
Let me get over your danger zones (uh oh, uh oh)
Until I provoke your screams (uh oh, uh oh)
And forget your last name


Despacito

Come on' to do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves shout &quot;Oh, blessed one&quot;
So that my seal stays with you (dance it)


Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)

We are getting closer, little by little (oh no)
That you show my mouth (uh oh, uh oh)
Your favorite places (favorites, favorites baby)
Step by step, soft little
We are going to stick a little bit
Until I provoke your screams (eh-oh) (Fonsi)
And forget your last name (DY)
