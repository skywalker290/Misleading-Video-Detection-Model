Nick ji's India is his in-laws house, we all are liking him very much, he is treating us very well like a son-in-law, he is the best couple.
This man really changed my opinion regarding American guys..!!

Priyanka Chopra returned

Age, Nationality or even Religion is no bar between them. Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas both willing to do anything for each other; indeed a bond made in heaven 

He is intelligent and mature

He never seems like he is married.

Imagine Nick and Priyanka in Kapil&#39;s show. I just want Nick to come in India and came to Kapil&#39;s show.

How much Nick Jonas respects and moreover tries to understand and engage in Indian culture just makes me really respect and love him...and not just him but his entire familyBeing an Indian it really feels good to see people opening up to different cultures...really happy for PC...hope she has a great life

Nickyanka is the best nickname for em

I love this couple

It&#39;s   how  priyanka  always  respects Nicks  privacy, here and at his public  shows and stays out of his work limelight

Now divorced

Prinick, priyanick,
Nick you are very handsome &amp; You are smart Priyanka and you are the best couple God bless both of you she is the daughter of India and India is your in-laws we all love you very much may you both be very happy 
I&#39;m so proud of Nick Jonas marrying an older woman that can smother him with motherly love.

Priyanka is talented actress

Chonas is a good nickname

Prone to getting &quot;hen pecked&quot;

<a href="">0:33</a> He is so thrilled !

The fact that priyanka choose not to come to the front is a proof how much she respect Nick&#39;s  space and moment️️️️. So gracious

You know what&#39;s the best thing about best persons that the interview is of Nick and the comment section is full of praises for Priyanka

The way he respects Indian culture is so precious . Every girl deserves a man like Nick 

Hounered you deserves houner Sweetheart I like your beautiful wife nd her apptitude about .....Nick

So blessed
Why all celebreties are uncomfortable while sitting in this seat

No matter how much love you have, you will soon get divorced.
The way she was there and didn&#39;t enter to the spotlight 

I don&#39;t understand why we as human beings (and especially as &quot;fans&quot;) need to take a nuance about a famous figure and laud it with all the positive hyperbole in the world. &quot;The way he respects her culture is so amazing and touching!&quot; Or, &quot;She is sooo down to Earth!&quot; Hmmm...looking within the grand human populace, you will see the same admirable traits. Let&#39;s stop using histrionics to make situations look more than they actually are. Start looking to your family and friends in association with that admiration. The people in this circle deserve it THE MOST, way more than any entertainment star. I will swear by it and I will promise you. This fawning over these &quot;illustrious icons&quot; is highly overrated and has gone on far too long.. And let&#39;s be truthful when assigning credits or kudos whenever we DO state praise. Because let&#39;s be honest: Any famousfigure captured on TV and in photos is ALWAYS going to appear in homage and appear to have only the best qualities  anyone can have. They are always going to put their best foot forward. But how they are in secret is their true character worth. And that is what we should focus on.

I watch both interview and They both have so many things to say about each other and I think that what true love is.

The way he respects Priyanka&#39;s culture is so adorable

“Prick”

Indians feel proud about this🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
NICK&#39;S &quot;LUCK&quot; THO LMAOOOO(sounds a lot like me ngl)
It&#39;s nothing 10 years gap in america but in india.... It&#39;s 3rd world war  

<a href="">

Priyanka makes every time proud moment for India,, all Indians celebraty go another country and getting married&#39; but Priyanka comes own home.. ️

&quot;Picnick&quot; :))

A Man who&#39;s priority is you ,and respects you and  engages himself in you like you do , is the one a real woman deserves.and I would choose to be that woman.. congratulating Priyanka and nick in Choosing the right one .

Priyanka and Jimmy are buddies

What&#39;s going on can you let me know what is the problem how so many man and women in my house and room  inside the wall what they are talking about

Me been thinking for 2 years ik it id nika lol

I think that is really cool that Nick Jonas can write his own plays and movies and I love that about him because I do the same thing and that is pretty cool

Note to self : don’t drink beer around Michale Keaton !! 

They must pull the chair and respect priyanka also

The way he respect the culture 

why he is not wearing his wedding ring?

The cruel profit routinely peel because ticket histochemically radiate aside a typical part. guiltless, verdant cow

Their couple name could be &#39;NickYanka&#39; 

I like that way how to introduce as her half it&#39;s lovely ️ proud of u both

Why the audience is shouting as if there is a mass shooting going on nearby?

Is priyanka really in crowd?

What a supportive wife.

Now nick has became the jejuu of all the girls of india️️

They&#39;re nickname should be picnic 

Kiss
Shevchenko
The right shorts pathologically guard because multimedia sadly employ underneath a cut move.  flippant, blue-eyed rat

Nick is very nice humble person. God bless him.

️️ Best couple ️ NP️️
This is Priyanka&#39;s husband?

Priyanka&#39;s confidence🇮🇳
Nick Jonas is incredibly well spoken. And just awesome ️

Nick : &quot;We met through a friend &quot; Jimmy : &quot; I had a friend, a F*<b>*G A*</b> &quot;

i jus love his cutee little smile mannnn!!!
Priyanka’s reaction to Nick saying “she likes Prick” is everything !!! 

I love nick jonas

I didn’t know that Nick Jonas writes his own plays and movies that is so cool

They love you,We love you,I love you,Then let&#39;s gets merried

Yeah!

Careful Nick ! 3 strikes your out !

Be careful the next time you drink around Michael Keaton Nick , or else we all know he will say “you better not be drunk” !

Marriage !

Cera ( the flower viel the groom wears was a saint mony hindi)

Resemblance with sagar the electrician in our lane in Gzb up!

Good choice

I laughed at both of them as how Priyanka liked to be called them as &#39;Prick&quot; bt Nick didn&#39;t like that nickname ..bt still he is so cute️

Both make such an adorable couple.

HE SPOKE IN BRITISH ENGLISH!!!!!im proud of PC for rubbing off on him

Awesome ️️
Nich is so mature and well mannered guy i have ever seen

The purring columnist jekely drown because toenail coincidently wobble out a vivacious nephew. cautious, painstaking digital

I&#39;m getting goosebumps while he&#39;s talking about Indian culture 

He calls her Prushi.... that’s lovely.

K guys why are there more haters and judgemental people in this comment section than I have seen under my favs Niyanka or i better call them Prick is my new favourite couple, even above Hailin and Joeler, they are so cute together they really do love each other a lot u can see that, but the comment section has negative people in minorities but in huge quantities whyyyYou guys need to understand that not everything which seems to be a business/clout chasing strategy was intended to be that way.

The way I laughed when he said Prick...

“Prick” , Pri and Nick , so slick we stick” I just made that up on the spot , I mean that’s really good for a thought , I’m a poet and I didn’t even know it !

He is rock why he married a mother looking woman question

I jst hate him

YES, INDIA AND WHITE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING ONE!

Nikyank is better than prick

POV: you love Prick.

Yo prick!

I love the way how jimmy congratulated both of them unlike ellen. She acted so weird when she invited priyanka to her show.

So this is where Gino the Germans name comes from

He should have called her up

Tbh everything he explained about our is so precise.

How he respects and adores Indian culture...that&#39;s lovely

Love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
The way he respect culture is making me love him

Priyanka made whole India proud

Ok you ...

It’s true I am very much worried about my hair jones needed medical  or I don’t know what type of help can work out for me...priyanka knows everything....so together pleasure needed early

If your still watching in 2020 December then it&#39;s your lovely john

I&#39;ve never been so jealous of someone until i saw priyanka 

God bless you both of you...

He should call her up.... M imbaressed

Why Priyanka in audience though 

I have made a video on Priyanka.C life do check 

If we like someone or something!We all end up finding even the little thing great about them!

I love both of them.But nick looks so young.

Hey Prick&#39;s pretty cool. Atleast, it&#39;s unique.

This Show is Not Bad I Love If I go on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Can Nick Jonas Be There

Perfect couple God bless you both

I think &quot;Niyanka&quot; will be better one...

Jimmy is much far better than our nepotism king...

SHE=10   HE= 6. and ppl were talking about him marrying an older woman. What about her marrying a few notches down?

<a href="">0:06</a> So much love in one place. &lt;3

Nick Jiju 
jimmy faloon you amazing we army love you

Nick..... You rock....
My fav couple of all... Nick is way more mature thn most of the indian actors i see... Good choice

The theme is &quot;Nick will meet Michael by spilling beer all over him&quot; yeah it&#39;s fun️

We Indians made the hashtag that they never thought of <a href="">#nickyanka</a> ️

OMG I love this couplebeautiful couple, his maturity is woww

Such a gem 

I just got schooled on my own culture by the Jonas brothers and I am ok with it.

christina aguilera
Y was priyanka there?????

the world best cute couple 

vsauce
I wonder who was the common friend? 

Nickname -&quot;prick&quot;️
His maturity is greater thn his age, that&#39;s why he chose priyanka over Gomez

Love the way they both respect each other&#39;s culture .. 

The Prince of America and The Queen of India. Looks like fairy tale love story does happen in real life.

Why does it matter the age difference? Priyanka has a bubbly personality while Nick is very serious so he actually seems older then her when she&#39;s responded then him like 10 years is seriously not that muc h so y&#39;all need to calm down

Both priyanka and nick respects each other and thats the best quality one should have and look at nick the way he is describing roka ceremony and hindu tradition so well that many indian men wont be able to explain

gloria trevi

They&#39;re so cute together

Apna desi banda

Priyanka looks like his step mom.

If both of them are happy with each other I don&#39;t think any body should have problems. They are happy , there families are happy (the thing matters the most ) that what matters the most .

Both nick and priyanka have 13M views on this channel!!!

Was she in the audience really?

I am Abhijit Naithani Ashu Bhai and  a Big Fan of Priyanka Chopra Mam and also Nick Jonas Sir , both are Good Celebrities, May God Bless them and Happy Married Life to my Beloved Madam PC and Nick...Bas. Enjoy Always....

Nick is definitely more matured than his age. He is so composed and very simple , which is the most important thing difficult to be.

Audience reaction is kind of irritating

This should be the official nickname &quot;pricknick&quot; 

He is really GentemenGod bless both of them

 BTS
he forgot the jonas brothers secretly decided to get back together and would be announcing it in 5-6 month

dry bar comedy

Nick you are one lucky guy you choose a women with looks brains talent love and most of all a Indian she is like a diamond good luck to both of you ️

I love how Jimmy hates the name &quot;Prick&quot; here, but like a few months later he helping Priyanka promote it on this same show, lmao

Why do I always feel like jimmy is faking it.... Overdoing everything?

those woooohhs are so unbelievably annoying.

Such a controversial couple, There both of completely different cultures &amp; race and have a more then a 10 year gap. Haven’t really seen much of interracial couples in Hollywood.

Hey, what about Prick??

I wanna hear Nick speak in Hindi...

Prick nickname
This guy never gets to speak...and even when he speaks it is like silence

NICK IS A GENTLEMAN!

I don&#39;t no how people get soooooo many likes i&#39;m the only one who doesn&#39;t get 1 likes

Well, He is the Son-in-Law Of India...️
So.... Priyanka+Nick= Prick I&#39;m like... Thank God Nick didn&#39;t get married to Deepika.

Nick Jonas is a man of fun

Nick and Priyanka a couple that prayers together stays together keep doing all the good things together and stay safe ️

He’s not even a manly man he’s a boy. I’m not hating but pc could’ve done better.

Really a unbreakable couple love you both ️️🇮🇳🇮🇳
<a href="">0:51</a> and that friend might be lily right

<a href="">0:39</a>When jimmy said priyanka who else thought that she was going to walk out and sit down

This couple is one of the most beautiful i have ever seen

Thanks to priyanka ....we got to know him after marrying pc. ...he is very good human being

I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s aware of it, but he&#39;s setting quite a high benchmark for prospective grooms here

Perfect couple ️
Nick actually respect and appreciate Indian culture and all rituals 

priyanka + nick = prick
Anyone from India

I’m not trying to be mean- but I’m curious. How the hell can jersey produce MCR(my chemical romance) AND Jonas Bro’s? That crazy  cool!! Seriously.

Both of them same horoscopes.

Hindu culture is very much beautiful

Priyanka is so beautiful

Who is this prick?????

Where can I find someone like him!!

The ohoh girls bursts my ear

I love yoy

Our Indian aunty stole this sweetest crush of world.....from all ️

Their couple are world&#39;s Best Couple.lots of love  from Nepal

My favorites among the favorites. Wish them much hapiness

Hes too young for her. It may not last

I like jimmy show instead of Ellen’s

I love how nick was so nice to indian traditions!

Roka he talking about its only matter that if u didnt fuk eacheacher before engangement

This ugli ass fuking prianka super model...

Well, all I can say is this guy is 7 billion times lucky to have a woman like Chopra, am officially jealousy but I ain&#39;t got nothing to do about it 

Prick causes BISEXUAL DISTRESS (but I also think they are SO sososo adorable )

I get Priyanka and Nick&#39;s points on the Prick name. Priyanka likes it causes it does combine both of their names, and it sounds catchy. Nick is like &quot;We can&#39;t sell child-size t-shirts with Team Prick on them without opening a can of worms for parents to explain what prick means&quot;  HA HA!!!!

I am form NJ too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Love you bothYou&#39;re lovely together

After knowing that Priyanka is sitting over there in between the audience, Jimmy should have called her to sit next to Nick Why didn&#39;t he called her?

<a href="">#PRICK</a>   LOL

Very cute couple, i&#39;m just waiting for their childrens lol

prick is besttttttt

Nick Jonas may be in love with Priyanka because he would have so many other options except Priyanka, but Priyanka is definitely an opportunist and gold digger. Shame on her. That host is a joke.

Nick is all heart 

You know Nick Jonas just got famous in India....In a population of 1.3 Billion only because of Priyanka.....Got a Bundle of audience in here in India only bcoz of &#39;PC&#39;No one knows him here before priyanka&#39;$

I love youWe love youYou love me I love me tooHilarious 
Wowww

Jonas brothers fan like

Nick Jonas the husband of the Priyanka Chopra is very good in nature I like his comment on the YouTube channel.

Amazing shows by Priyanka Chopra is very good, just like quizzes,

“Jumped right in”

prinick

umahhhh 
They were filming the doc here!!

After all this time, who sits sometimes and is just like &quot; I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re married&quot;

that is a M A N wowza

I love Pryanka and Nick bless them.

He is a midget

Nick doesn’t know how many hearts he broke with the engagement like if he broke yours

I honestly have no idea  why people have such a issue with their  age difference and the funny thing is I have heard some American interviewers saying that Indians are conservative but the fact that most of whom are complaining about their age difference are Americans  like seriously grow up people 

Priyanka and Nick...PrickWell, thankgod Deepika didnt marry Nick

Prick - Priyanka Chopra Jonas &amp; Nick Jonas!  What A Lovely Couple

I ship them so fucking much!!!!

Beautiful Nick you are so grounded and warm hearted. Lovely how Pc just cutely enjoyed the show from hiding place!

Mature and respected couple ever seen.

I’m a fans of priyangka since she’s winning those miss world title and don’t even imagine she’s married to this American teen singer.. I thought she’s gonna choose one of Indian millionaire

Nick Jonas is younger than priyanka but is Soo mature I think they match each other perfectly. They must be really lucky to get each other. Love y&#39;all

I accidentally clicked this video and he s not actually joking but people are laughing

I actually like the name &quot; prick &quot;

Instead of &quot;Prick&quot;, what about Niyanka? Huh? Nick, let me know if you like it.

May I just say it’s funny that nick is the youngest Jonas brother but is wife is older than Kevin and he’s the oldest

Love them

The British accent tho  

He is a calm, mature and a wise guy .

<a href="">3:20</a>

Priyanka+Nick= pricklolThank God Deepika&#39;s not marry with Nick

I just keep watching this over and over I know they are married now. I just hope it last I love this couple

Nick so mature over his ages ...love...just love can make them to be one....

Why is priyanka in the dark?

Nikos You are very respectful and nice guy From Tibet

Priyanka Chopra’s father was accused of molesting a 12 yr old. She used her crown power and money to not make the story come out as it should be and the victim had struggled a lot. Post the incident she had a tattoo “ dada lil girl”. She as a woman and miss world never took up on the issue and instead defended a criminal. Sadly it’s her father. Very disgusting person and fake person and shame to the family.

Most of Hollywood celebrities wanted to marry nick jonas but guess who did the job an indian the one and only pryanka

I love that 

Nick-name get it?? This vid is about Nick Jonas? No.. okie

Nick jonas is a man who is young talented cute and very down to earth. I dnt know how he fell in love with priyanka chopra....

Shiv Ji, our Maa Durga, keep our hearts blessed....
PriyankaPrNick  ickYou do the rest

Hiiiii

What I feel is that Nick and Priyanka have a great understanding in their relationship

He&#39;s still wearing that yellow thread around his wrist from the &#39;ROKA&#39; ceremony!!

U are wife riyal age 42 not 35age she is old ledy u are yangr boy bad lack

O nik u are puar boy but u are wife priyaka 42age ledy not good I don&#39;t like u wife sorry she is feck ledy u are very good but wife not good

Why didn’t the host or nick bring her up on the stage to be with nick

Cool guy here n he got engage to her Priyanka  here wow n now married now wow congrats

<a href="">#Niyanka</a>

They proved that respect every religion..really impressed.

<a href="">4:10</a> the hoot was priyanka&#39;s ?

He is cute and handsome and all, but that woman, she has got to be the most beautiful woman on Earth :)

I really enjoyed priyankas movies when I do watch Indian films she&#39;s at the top of her game always a fan 4vever.  Finally  Hollywood and Bollywood  getting married too in a way..   thanks to the diversity of the new generation era  future will be interesting

Nick Jonas married a talented actress from India ..India&#39;s priyanka

Sopranos best tv series ever
Why they cant interview together

Get to know the real indians you&#39;ll discover what assholes those people actually are!They always want to use you for one thing or another..

Omg i Love them

Yannick is better. Its like &quot;unique&quot; when you pronounce it. 

NickYanka ️
Indian women rarely if ever marry outside their culture...cut the crap ....Im totally jealous!

Bollywood meets the Jersey Shore

Curry lamb on rice is heavenly

Fallon is very Indian...

Jumanji was amazing
Prick?  Nononononono, how about not

<b>Prick</b> for nickname, lol i typed that before knowing that Priyanka said that in the video.

The Jonas Brothers came back, go see their new song &quot;Sucker&quot;

Made for each other

Nick is the ultimate husband material ️️️️
Oof he said they met 6 years ago...meaning this is when the Jonas Brothers were going/about to part ways 

How respectful Nick is of Priyanka’s culture honestly makes me so incredible happy. Like seriously, find you a man like that.

the way he respects priyanka’s culture just warms my heart so so much

Who is she pri

I freaking love jumanjiiiii️
When he starts looking like his dad in 10 years she will leave his ass

Age is just a number... I love them..

Priyanka Brilliant and he is......???

Their nicknames should be prinick

hes so mature despite his age and he’s so knowledgeable and respectful of her culture.. love them

prick or Nika

the way he says &quot;She and I&quot; shows how much he keeps her before himself and his preference. &lt;<a href="">#LOVE</a>&gt;

Great now we just need a jo bros reunion

&quot;A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he&#39;s finished.&quot; - Zsa Zsa Gabor

A spectacle can influence so many.... unfortunate.

Can we just, for a second, talk about what an awesome story teller he is....I loved the Michael Keaton story  also I love them both together

If priyenka and nick were together in this show it wouldhave been a fab

They both worked with the rock

Lol ! Prick... I actually think that sounds nice but something maybe a little different!!!!!

Prick&#39; is cute i mean it&#39;s better than &#39;Niyanka&#39; 

When jimmy said &quot;Our buddy&quot;
India&#39;s son in Law

Priyanka shouting Prick from the audience 

He exactly described what Indian engagement is about,Great.

In 20 years he well dumb her ass

Am I the only one who forgot Nick was from Jersey

Both of them r idiots

Prick lmao  she&#39;s bad.  question?? Isn&#39;t nick Jonas Jewish ?
Hi
Adorable together ️
 <a href="">#prick</a>
He is too good for her... she seems arrogant. Not a fan of Priyanka

Their nickname should be picnicWho agrees??

<b>she likes prick</b>

Nickyanka

“Prick” . She’s a keeper.
Prick 
So no one else wants to say it? Cuz were all just a bunch of PC, SJWs. This fucking couple is cringey as hell  priyanka looks like the kids mother. So offsetting

Nick were is your wedding ring

I want nemi back !!!

Can anyone tell me why she isn&#39;t on the stage and standing at the back

I’m so happy for them

Love Nick and Priyanka, 

Interesting and Nice

Priyanka is very fun to be with  They look great together. Im happy they got married 

Imagine wat if nick’s next romantic song features priyanka chopra...

Hey we men should not be jealous just️peace️

Congratulations!
Bless them both to be together for a life. 

He’s a handsome guy and seems to be a good person in his face and behavior, his eyes are a little unsuitable for a completely positive character, and in the end Prianka was lucky with her husband, but he wasn’t very lucky with his wife, she will eat him.
Nick is a  5’’6 midget. They will have midget babies

So cute..NP forever
Why the hell she is standing on the side? why cant jimmy introduce her and make her sit besides nick?

I love you both

Best couple...

Congart.pc and nick

Nickyanka
PriyaNicka ???
Glad to hear such an incredible words towards <a href="">#india</a> and the <a href="">#Indian</a> <a href="">#culture</a> by the one and only <a href="">#NickJonas</a> Well I&#39;m also a newly madly fan of <a href="">#NickJonas</a>I&#39;m actually a guitar learner and now days I&#39;m try to play a super famous number sung by <a href="">#NickJonas</a> <a href="">#IntroducingMe</a> I wish I could 

Best couple

Even in polka dot pants, I still love Nick! <a href="">#Flywithme</a>

Congrats

I knew that this kind of man attracted her
Little different from Jersey is right

Introducing me.

Jimmy&#39;s guest are always funnier than him lol

india capture kashmier and killing in kashmier

Prick good match
She got married to him for US citizenship, quite evident man

I always thought Nick would marry Britney Spears, pop star royalty  

They were basicially datin online for 6months and then met up finally in person and dated for 5months b4 he proposed damn that&#39;s quick but i guess u know when ya know but this couple nick and priyanka not expected at all

Age is just a number. My bf is 6 years younger than me. We both are happy together. 

I love priyanka!!!!!️
they both look so cute together... some people are saying about their age but love does not see age.. it sees the feelings and emotions that people had for u....

bohot bohot cute lag rahe he

Priyanka was so professional that she didn&#39;t come to sit when Jimmy mentioned her. Such honourable and classy behaviour gave nick all the attention didn&#39;t want to take it away.

I watch that Movie, enjoys them game of survival

he is a boy and she is an old lady there is no chemistry

Koi na#5
I think priyanka is very nice girl,,,,she&#39;s ok for me for him than other Hollywood actress or American actress coz American actress is very fast to divorce after married in how so many years they together,,it&#39;s ok if other nationality......hope they still strong......

HELP what brand is the jacket Nick is wearing?? Thanks!!

This is the most transparent I have ever seen nick ... he must be veryyy happy fr

Am here after the marriage

Jimmy is Weird

Prick lmfao

Love you both

Congratulations nd God bless you both 

God bless them

U happy now??? Hmmm???

Nick jonas has more money and fans. The woman who will marry her will be recognised more .He is famous from his teens. He is still young and already more and more fans like any young American famous singer has.Cheers Mr jonas. ....

isn&#39;t she like, 10 years older than him?

I’m not here to watch the whole video just was wondering from thumbnail the couple name would be like (niriyanka /pick) lol

<a href="">

Why was Priyanka standing there in the corner???

If I was in  nick&#39;s place I would have called priyanka mom and not honey or dear 

<a href="">#jonanka</a>
She Likes PRICK 

They is a cute couple

Priyanka best of Nick Indian girl is very beautiful

Did u guys too notice that priyanka wasn&#39;t really there rather it feels like as if some kind of rays were projected...I mean just look at the transparency of her image in that corner...

He defined &#39;ROKA&#39; ceremony  so beautifully <a href="">#respect</a> 

See the level of other country Priyanka is also a celebrity eventhen she is not on stage.

Howww sweet... The smile on Nick&#39;s face when the host says &quot;Priyanka&quot;    both r perfect

Suddenly a fans of NP  wishing them happy marriage ever after 

The mood
I can&#39;t believe this has over 8m views, lol

Female to male transgender    Nick Jonas   (Fake man)    {Research &quot;TransVestigation&quot;   on you tube } in absolutely fake &quot;relationship&quot;   with priyanka.Expect some big drama. the entire wedding is a set up Some sort of diabolical social re engineering drama involving India.Priyanks is embarrassed to be involved in this but she has no choice she has sold her soul.

Love Ur genuineness nick... It&#39;s so bful to c u and Priyanka together

M I the only one who is not concerned about the video but the comments

sham marriage

You both look perfect together age doesn&#39;t matter at all just keep the love going 
<a href="">#PriyankaChopra</a> marrying to her Son Age <a href="">#Nick</a> XlolX

Easiest way to get green card good luck

Good sent.

I find the whole thing a little bit sad.  Not God&#39;s best for a christian but then look at the downward spiral he&#39;s had through the years.  Doesn&#39;t surprise me he marries a girl like this.

Love you both.. Nick n pc

Wow I love this coupleMay God bless them

He’s 10 years younger than her.. anyway they look good and love each other

Both of these plastic shit eating phonies are starved for validation.  Both depended on the temporary outer marketable appearance of their now gone youth.  Now they think they are ballers.  The grossest of the gross.  Nobody will tell them they’ve been over for a while now.

I guess there&#39;s finally a straight couple I ship just as much as Ellen and Portia 

Sooo beautiful nick
So cuuuuute
She don’t love she love your money

I still feel a bit awkward

he z so loving
Jumaji earned coz of Rock and Kevin and Jack not because of him.. .... Get your facts correct Jimmy..

He said &quot;She&#39;s the best&quot; twice.<a href="">0:46</a><a href="">1:53</a>

Bc sbka ktega ???
Priyanka&#39;s is my favorite artis

he looks like a kid compared to her,, i dont see the appeal

She is ugly shit as hell

Priyanka needs to get pregnant NOW! She’s already 36 I won’t be surprised when the news come out in 3 months later or so after their wedding lmao

Super jodi

Looking forward to the divorce

True love happens suddenly.. that&#39;s prove!!! Just Look at him guys.. he is so excited while describing everything about her..



Why is she keep sitting there......... FUCKIN RACISM!!!!!!

Nah man... At the end of the day! You India... You lose

I love the fact that despite Priyanka being there she didn&#39;t come infront and take away the spotlight from Nick on the show

I admire Nick as he shows lot of respect for the country &amp;  the culture she belongs to...but what surprised me was his tears.... while she walked towards him ....this shows all human are with same emoticons no matters what cultute... which place....I wish them good luck.

Congrats Priyanka on hitching the greatest fuckboy in Hollywood.

Or a nick chopra

They are going to make a priyanka jonas

The Bollywood Hollywood ARE VERY LUCKY.. BRO!!

Nick you&#39;re such a real man, who is full of quality. You picked a women who is breathtakingly beautiful to settle down with.Only a real man can see a women&#39;s value. (her heart, soul, spirit, character) Real men don&#39;t want the youngest they can get, to feel more like a man. They want someone who is enough. Someone who they share real love with.I wish you 2 a lifetime full of joy ️

What the heck Nick, are you a Christian turned into a Hindu??  What a waste!

Its amazing how they got to know each other’s for a short time but he loved her to marry her not for fun.

Wow my favourite actor just engaged to my favourite singer
