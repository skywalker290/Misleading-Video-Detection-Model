Hey stranger you have have good taste of 

Shushant we always love you
No.1 
Who missing Sushant still ? Like Karo.

So much relaxation voice 
Shushant sing Bollywood's second srk ths
My crush looks like sushant
Banti aamake kiss koro
Sushant
We&#39;ll hide somewhere here  in the comments forever, hai na shivute

They killed him because he was bagging all the movies, all the heroes of today’s time are zero in front of Sushant, is there even one good looking hero  and a good actor , all in one , a good human being , today ? , “ NO “ How could they take him down, if the whole nation comes together and stands together and protests to put the culprit behind the bar, it will happen. 

Best lines- Who will give away your mile to the world...!!! Beautiful lyrics

The wonderful song 
Lyrics..........<a href="">12:24</a> one of my favorite song

Bean ask my name and four steps beyond keeping the rituals.. just four steps, both of you walk with me. Bean ask my name and four steps beyond keeping the rituals.. just four steps, both of you walk with me.. Bean say something, Bean hear something in your hands. Just take four steps in my hand, walk four steps with me, don't say anything to me, don't listen to anything, take four steps in my hands, just walk four steps with me, we will shade you in the sun, we will spread shade on your path, if you are scared of darkness, we will go and punish you from every corner of the sky, we will make you laugh by telling sad jokes, we will laugh Laughing and humming like this, we will walk four steps, if you meet any traveler, who is afraid of this world? What are four steps? I will walk with you all my life.. without saying anything, without listening to anything. Just take four steps, walk four steps with me.

Shreya Ghoshal voice
Without asking my name and leaving aside the rituals, just walk four steps with me. Without saying anything, without listening to anything. Just walk four steps with me holding my hands. We will spread the sunshine and shade on your path. If we scare you, we will go and punish you with the moon. We will share our sadness with you and make you laugh. We will make you laugh and hum just like that. We will walk four steps humming. Whoever meets you, who is a traveler, who is afraid of this world? What are four steps? I will walk with you all my life, without saying anything, without listening to anything. Four steps, holding hands, just walk four steps with me.

Every line of this song is still a pain for many people who had to split in front of the two letters of fate. As time goes by, those memories will increase in value.

No matter how many years pass, the sweetness of this sweet song will remain the same

If we can feel someone&#39;s absence, it means that person is present in our heart.

Who still listen this song just for sushant 2023?

Nice song sushant bhaiya
This was the first movie I saw him in.  I had no idea who he was.  Some people didn&#39;t like his acting or his voice and this and that.  I thought he was just delightful in this movie and wished I was younger!!  He is so handsome, acting was terrific and sad that he had to end his life!  I do not know much about what could have led him to take this final step but I wish he hadn&#39;t.  I know life can be tough as walking on nails, trust me I know,  I have been through hell and back a few times.  If you ever need to talk or need someone to listen to you, please reach out to me and I will be happy to talk with you.

Miss you ️

King of Bollywood is Shushant sing rajput.....

Bahout hi achha insaan tha,,

Woke movie that targets Hindu beliefs and customs and Glorifies Love Jihad.

I couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;s gone. I just rewatch the movie in 2023 and read about his death, shocking truth.

I still remember this movie did&#39;nt dub in telugu but the theaters in telugu states has been housefull for pk movie during 2014.

He is 10000 times the actor Selmon will ever be

He is no more but whenever I hear this I feel his appears before me.

they killed him, but sushant&#39;s goodness, his polite behavior with his fans and everyone, his humbleness, his down to earth nature will always make him alive in everyone&#39;s heart 

&quot; and I’m walking, walking around Moscow...” ))

Anushka Sharma reminds Shraddha Walkar.
Miss you  susantto
Keep wondering where does Shaan fit exactly - in the midst of all the greats we&#39;ve had and have. He is not part of those discussions often. Yet, you hear him every once in a while, in something like this, and just know, he&#39;s undoubtedly up there somewhere - his greatness untouched by comparisons, and senseless rankings. He&#39;s just Shaan.

Sush eyes
0.28-0.32 that Sushant&#39;s innocent face..Those eyes

This is my favorite song and I have listened to it 500 times......!!️

Love you Susant. Miss you
He deserves more then what the world offered him..

Why has he become so famous only after his death. Why didn&#39;t we appreciate him when he was alive

Sushant - Anushka chemistry looks so natural in this film.... They only had small chemistry in this film.️️️

Look at Sushant, how much love he has paid... Miss u 
engineer means sushant
He had a unique resemblance to the actor Mohan Gokhale. Sadly, both are no more.

Once I thought that this person has given  such a flawless work in this short time and I have my whole life to watch his work thinking so I felt releived but who knew.........

Miss you Sushant Singh Rajput

who&#39;s listening this peaceful song in 2022‍️
Sushant.... So charming, so handsome, the heart throb of millions  - chose to leave us behind and walk away char kadam ahead of us. May his soul rest in peace. The song is happy and cheerful which lifts up our spirits.

RIP....Sushant Singh Rajput 

I have a friend, his name is Abhinav, we are in class. He is looking a little cloudy, maybe he is tired. Don't tell me what happened to the bass. Nobody cares about me. But no one can tell me anything but the bass has worn out, since 9 hours of sleep have come, what smkju?
I will never forget this man  I always love you Shushant sir and miss you
