Tim Burton bringing Michael Keaton in this movie is so cool! He would have been proud seeing his Batman return one last time.

Hello movies collection!!!! Greats, greetings, nace movie!!!!!
Baby Dumbo would &#39;ve looked cute in a disposable baby diaper. I love him. He is adorable. So precious. So cute. So sweet.

This movie was unsettling as an adult, I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;d be like as a kid. Some cartoons don&#39;t need to be made to look real.

I haven’t been watching it, because in general it’s a sad story and I am afraid I will be crying. Yes yes I know it’s fake blabla. Still. Also the Disney drawing movie is really sad story. I just don’t understand how you can make it so sad…

Both versions of Dumbo should be withdrawn from circulation because the main character is an elephant the symbol of the GOP.

I love this movie !! I&#39;m sorry to being late for this movie but....  This is so touching me  After watching this movie, I want to pay more for the Animal charity donation  / I think the live-action Dumbo is so cute like the REAL young elephant be!!! Thank you for all team work of this movie!!!!  Thank you so much.

Dumbo&#39;s magic  I can fly with my ears! I need no flights ! 

This is by far the best Disney Remake of them all, It’s amazing and SO Beautiful 

There were 2 penguins Danny and Colin and a Batman Michael

I just watched it on Disney plus. Dumbo got a small part in this movie. The movie is more about  Collin F + the 2 kids. And the movie kinda sucks. Disney failed with this movie.

Very touching  movie  super cute dumbo 

Dumbo Happy help

Y is he called dumbo

Left me out kmt

I have a question and a thought, in the disney cartoon dumbo was delivered by the storks and in the real life version of the new movie dumbo was born and there&#39;s one thing that I thought who&#39;s dumbo father or did he have one????

Dumbo's movie is beautiful!!! It talks about the love from mother to son and vice versa... that is happening across the globe today.
Is Timothy the mouse not in this remake? He was such a crucial character in the original, being Dumbos only friend

i&#39;m here for danny

I&#39;ve never seen something both more hideous and terrifying at the same time.

Dumbo is what how the pesky vegans and ARA cultists depict dairy and meat induatry was like.

Is it aurora&#39;s voice?
Wow

Nice remake

this is great the trailer

auroras cover of baby mine OMG

The only Disney remake that truly hit their mark!!

Not a fan of this movie... but, this trailer is so beautiful!

Dumbo and his mom 

Dumbo music
who&#39;s version of  Baby Mine is this??? it&#39;s so good, but the arcade fire version is not it. I can&#39;t find this version, please someone tell me

Dumbo movie, where Dumbo is not the protagonist hahaha
Fun fact: That little girl in the remake is the same actors who will later play Sarah Miller in HBO&#39;s The Last of Us. Damn, she&#39;s come a long way from this.

I liked this live action actually

Me and mom went and saw this movie the night it came out and it was one of the best new Disney movies I really enjoyed and it reminded me of when I was in Disney world to visit my sister around December 2018 On the night when I arrived there was when I first saw the trailer of this in the all star movies gift shop and It really captured my interest in the magic of Disney and everything so thank you so much for inspiring me With this amazing new remake film of Disney’s Dumbo

I wonder how many migs he picks up with  those ears?

Look at those ears!

Well this remake was down right adorable.I still love the original. But sometimes they actually put some heart into the remake&#39;s.Very few remakes ever make it into my list of favorites.

My mom ....love you forever in a lifetime...

It owuld have been if DISNEY made a film about the ELEPHANT THAT THOMAS EDISON ELECTROCUTED. THEN i COULD GET ON BOARD AND UNDERSTAND ANIMALS IN ZOOS, ANIMALS LIVES WASTED FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF MAN WAS ABOUT. INSTEAD,  DISNEY RE-WROTE A LONG LOVED CHILDS STORY INTO A WEAK ATTEMPT AT ANIMAL RIGHTS. ANOTHER DISNEY FLOP!! CHOOSE A REAL STORY AND TELL THE TALE CORRECTLY. DISNEY!

Wait there was a dumbo live action? And it was 3 years ago???

This is why I have the profile dumbo I will always love dumbo since if I’m an adult

I love dumbo  And mrs jumbo
I love dumbo  And Mrs jumbo 
this isn&#39;t a bad movie

I&#39;ll wait for Dumbo 8. A such lack of creativity and imagination from Disney... Disgusting

Listen the animated version is more meaning stop also destroying movies cause of begin lazy and rushing quality I grew up when things where simple and this is a terrible remake for the kids leave certain movies alone also it’s a as a bad move to Buy Marvel studios and den change the movies around after Stan Lee dies you gonna lose major sales lying to the consumer

I love the scene where Colette holds the boy on her lap as he sleeps.

bless tim burton but I’ll never forgive disney for ruining their live action remakes with unmemorable human characters, auto-tune on ones we needed realism in the voice for, no seamless musical/acting transitions, cutting essential already crowd-tested&amp;approved songs out of the classic remakes, adding completely new songs that nobody asked for. With the current content we just wanted Be Prepared in Lion King and to see Nala actually sing spirit as beyonce.

Dies fake
<a href="">1:35</a>

This is a different 1941 version.

Looong time throw back

I have to say this film is BEAUTIFUL its one of my top 10 films in the world for me best remakejust a complete masterpieceThank you Tim Burton

Disney dumbo and Brianna shead princess elephant  short

so far my FAVORITE live action remake

remember this isnt a remake its a reimagining

Is it just me or did Dumbo (2019) get forgotten almost immediately after it came out out.

Bill Burr sent me

i like it

I just watched this movie.  It had Tim Burton splashed all over it!  LOVE Tim Burton!!!

<a href="">1:50</a> thought it was Johnny Depp

Totally cried like a baby.. felt like the movie was all about animal abuse. The ending was so nice lukily, cried even harder lol.

I&#39;m really glad they rebooted this movie. I used to like the old Dumbo movie but when I finally saw it clearly I realized it was a racist movie

Stern
The film has 2 cinematic Penguins

I was kinda disappointed in this movie cuz I expected for it to be a movie about dumbo but turns out it was about the kids instead. I expected better

Stop using synthetic fertilizer.
Wild Animals Don’t Belong in CircusesForcing wild animals to perform confusing tricks under threat of violent punishment is a barbaric practice that has no place in a compassionate society.Animals in circuses have been either bred in captivity or taken from their homes and enslaved – solely for the purpose of entertainment. They’re condemned to a sad and frustrating existence, carted from one venue to another in cramped cages and barren trailers and trained to perform tricks to avoid being beaten or otherwise abused.In their natural habitat, elephants walk long distances, swim, explore, play, and enjoy complex social relationships. But in circuses, they’re chained inside tents or confined alone to concrete enclosures, denied everything that’s natural and important to them.Most big cats roam across large territories in the wild, so when they’re held in captivity, they frequently exhibit stereotypic behaviour, such as pacing, out of frustration.

Animal abuse!

It’s been this long??????????????

aww

I had just watched this last night for the first time ever and I have to say I was shocked because it was a pretty good, that&#39;s for sure.Well at least I liked it. For remake it turned out pretty good and now I&#39;m waiting for Disney to do the live action movie for Snow White, who knows that one can turn out to be great as well.

They make me crying like a doggy️️️
Why was Vandervere&#39;s line &#39;Come with me. Together, we can soar on that elephant&#39;s wings&#39; cut from the film and not included as a deleted scene at least?

Sad

Greatest showman but for dumbo /neg

The story of how I actually met Dumbo’s mom
Is reminder me from this movies like Netflix miss peregrine s home of peculiar children 2016 , Disney plus Alice in Wonderland 2010 and johnny Depp Alice through the looking glass 3d 2016,-05.

I hope they release pocahontas finally, too Dumbo made me goosebumps.

Have to cry anytime I see it.

I cry every single time I watch the trailer of this movie ….. and I haven’t watch it yet cause I know I’ll cry like a baby 

Don&#39;t use wild animals in circuses!! Horses and dogs love to do tricks, but lions, elephants, bears, or even orcas and dolphins shouldn&#39;t be captured to entertain people. Fortunately, they took animated animals.

I just finished watching this movie. Dumbo is so cute

Booking closed. Show starts soon ....    Greetings - The Great Bombay Circus.

I absolutely love Dumbo so I thought  this movie will be great and I watched it and I found out it was great. It was all thanks to me if I wasn&#39;t thoughtful I wouldn&#39;t have watched at all

this is my fav childhood film i love it so much

This &quot;Dumbo&quot; directed by Tim Burton is actually better than Walt Disney&#39;s classic animated one. Because it was way too awkward and it also had rude people that nobody likes along with racism in it that effects people&#39;s lives so badly.

I actually watch this show to

Balelas: The death of the deaf devil


And the deaf devil died!
And he went to perform in heaven.
When he arrived at a door, he was asked by the doorman: Do you want salvation?
And the devil quickly replied: Yes, I want it!
Then the doorman said to him: But if you haven't even been cured yet, how do you listen to me now?
And the devil, without giving in, replied: No, no! There must be a mistake. I'm blind!
Then the doorman asked him: So you can't see me?
And the devil then replied: No.
Then the doorman said to him: Then go to hell! Because no blind devil gets here alone! Go, repent and sin no more.
And the devil, murmuring, complained: But this will be a very great punishment for me. I'm already used to the heat of embers and arid deserts! I even have air conditioning.
And when the devil woke up, and he saw that it was just a dream, he asked himself: What does this mean? Will it get hotter next summer? What if I act mute?

Yay casey jr isssssssssssss back

The awkward feeling when you relaise that a cute baby elephant, two wooden children actors, the Penguin, the Vulture from Spider-Man Homecomming and the director of weirdness, Tim Burton, made a better Live Action Disney remake, than Mulan&#39;s. And to think that Mulan had ALL the ingredients and the pontential of taking the beloved animated film and turn it into something epic!

Underrated movie 
Oil for Nong to fall in love with this advertisement.
They had to ruin it to make it more about the dumb humans that didn&#39;t even make the story better

In my opinion these movies are nothing compared to the drawn Disney movies they are much more exiting with voice actor and drawn characters

The police arrested the man arrested the man has received in a recess the resident arrested the list of them again

Dumbo the elephant

Is so cute i love away so i so cute
Dumbo is my favorite characters

Give yourself great encouragement.
A walker has a house, I Jip, Chao Sa Loi Fa, I Aim's daughter, E Aoi, I Bem, Kasetsart, E Jiab, a funny arm tattoo, asking if he still dares to do it, will he be able to forgive him? I Aim has gotten a divorce...
What about the advertising team?
Is it good?

Dumbo is cute crowd is ugly who exploit poor innocent defenceless souls.

We already watch that on our school

disgusting circus with animals

Waw baby dumbo dumbo️
Fun fact:dumbo is actually a man crawling

this movie looks awesome but Dumbo is so depressing. that poor elephant. 

We must find Dumbo unless it&#39;s a shape shifter which would amount to 180

premiering on disney channel tonight

after watching the movie I wanna watch it again

So dumbo cast has 2 Batmans and penguin very impressive 

Huh dumbo so cute i want to hug him

@):19 it says &quot;Jumbo&quot; instead of Dumbo on the banner, haha.

I love this movie.. made me cry just watching little dumbo get separated from his mum

My favourite movie i love you Dumbo so much
bro joomer
I&#39;m sorry, but the young girls personality and over all character was so cringe. :/ The movie would&#39;ve been much better without her in my own opinion.

This movie helps my soul

I&#39;m didn&#39;t really like this movie but dang it this trailer is beautiful.

This movie is incredibile 

best Disney Re-make ever Tim Burton is a Legend for this masterpiece &lt;3

DISNEY!! Please stop remaking your Disney Classic Movies!!!

If you are an Arab, press like and let us see who is more foreign or Hanna
Damn this movie is unhistorrically accurate but it is very good

I never wanted to watch this movie because i know how the story goes. Watching the trailer already made me cry 

Peace and love to everyone

I came through the Mega HD Filmes app, they sent me to the wrong trailer. Because the movie I wanted to see was the old one
It should be a fucking war-crime that they didn&#39;t released the Aurora remix of baby of mine.

I’ve never wanted to hug a CGI elephant more than what I do now.

The movie got lot of hate but I didn&#39;t mind this

I can’t see the movie …. I am crying like crazy seeing even the trailer

I think this movie is very underrated

I liked the original version better!

I Love Dumbo From 1941 Because He Kidnapped His Mother

There’s something about Tim Burton Disney remakes that really make them stand out compared to the others.  They don’t feel like cash grabs, they actually feel like they’re well executed and a sense of imagination

That ending makes me cry a lot.

My mom really loves that movie!

The music is sooo much good    
Ralph Breaks Internet Mary Poppins Returns Dog&#39;s Way Home and Lego Movie 2 AMC theater Early 2019 DVD&#39;s like Smallfoot Goosebumps 2 and Pups Save Puplantis

I want to watch this with someone&#39;s daughter

yikes. this movie was not good

Im actually watching the movie now and i swear if they don&#39;t reunite Mrs Jumbo (yes that&#39;s DUmbo&#39;s mom&#39;s name) with Dumbo in this movie I&#39;m GOING TO BE PISSED!

I might be biased because i have a cleft palate which is a mouth defect but I find a baby elephant with giant ears REALLY CUTE! Plus aren&#39;t real baby elephants ears large compared to their bodies?

Tim Burton did an amazing job with this movie it just goes to show what a fantastic director he truly is and it made me cry especially the scene when Dumbo goes to find his mum truly brilliant

Is this a film about a flying elephant Dumbo. Or is it about a female child that shows othere female children how strong and independent a woman can be, to seak there one way. And when things dont go there way, its a mans fault. It is typical of disney now days to incorporate female feminism shit in their movies

The clown makeup on Dumbo completely broke my heart...I had to go back to make sure I wasn’t having nightmares!

I love the most I love so much I love them Damoh

The saddest thing is that Casey Jr only made one appearance in the movie and barely saw him again. And they really F##### him up. His smile looks straight out of a Creepy Pasta and he’s dirty as hell. What happened to him?!

They made it unrealistic when they added the black girl, weren’t we living under segregation or something during that time lol

AWESOME

Wonderful story
Dumbo makes you a kinder and better person. The best Tim Burton&#39;s movie by far.

Me to this movie make me cry to
Poor dumbo mom
I have made a elephant puppet

I've watched it in the cinema
I cried while watching this movie... So heartwarming...But am i the only one feel glad that they didnt make the pink elephants feel scary like the original one?

Who says African elephants aren't smart? They're learning how to walk..
he looks real

Who watching this trailer in 2021 anyone, I don&#39;t care what people said about this movie, this movie is a Masterpiece To Directed By Tim Burton

Why people hate this movie, they haters or what

Oh so cute

Who else cried when they heard “Baby Mine?”

I wasn’t disappointed in the movie. I actually liked how it was a retelling and not a shot-for-shot remake. But I found distasteful the fact that the movie focused more on the human characters than Dumbo.

Its sad and it infuriates me when I see dickheads doing such crimes ... feel to just break their bones and hang them up in front of everyone .....

Its soo cutee

watching now

people how cute lol
Wow, so good to see Gabourey Sidibe still working.

Eva Green thoooooo

ITIS NAS VEDOV

so cute and sade
My honest opinion is that I didn’t care for it. Honestly I didn’t like what they did with the (SPOILERS) theme park. I thought it was very strange. I also felt it was strange how instead it’s more focused on the humans and the animals, instead of mainly dumbo and the animals. I’m sorry but honestly these remakes need to stop. I feel like we need something original. If you liked it then that’s fine, cause we can share our opinions without HATE

How come I not seen this movie before in Disney plus

Promoting animal abuse

What a great movie!!!!
Who else are here after watching the movie?

At first i thought Corrin farrel in the movie was a villain.

dombo and more
wow

Out of all the live action Disney movies, this is my least favorite. I can confidently say that I didn’t like it at all.

I Love Dumbo, shes adorable.. please respect elepants or any kind... please stop hurting them...

Beautiful movie for whole Family

No wild animals should be held in circus this movie is all about and treat animals as a family,please open your heart for every animals in this world,God Bless you and your Whole Family

This trailer is a good Youtube video, but terrible as a trailer.

“ Welcome baby Dumbo “.Ivan: Dumbo? What the fu-

That song always makes me cry when I hear it! Anyone else?

Dumbo

Very emotional trailer

Good old days in 1941.

Watching now, so cute Dumbo

The ending was so beautiful and necessary. Stop eating animals. They are mom&#39;s and son&#39;s such as we are. Don&#39;t hurt them ️

This must be the most beautiful trailer Disney has ever released

They're not just toys... I'll pass and then what?

Clara. Dumbo. 
I love this Dumbo movie. It&#39;s heartwarming. I cried when Ms.Jumbo was locked in the cage and Dumbo missed her mother so much, just like the original did. Idk why I prefer this than the animated Dumbo. It just... different.. Yeah, and I love it, but the animation one was good actually. It&#39;s just only the children&#39;s acting that wasn&#39;t good entire this movie, but I am okay with that. It&#39;s sad that most of people hate this movie very much and they said this movie sucks :&quot;(

Go vegan because that&#39;s the only way to stop animal exploitation and create a better world. Check vegan channels and <a href="">nutritionfacts.org</a> for more info on veganism and FACTS that EVERYONE should know. There are enough willfully ignorant people in the world, don&#39;t be one.

Is the elephant real? Coz people are posting it as real elephant named ando i think it&#39;s cgi elephant!

Fly Dumbo Fly Me : 
Tim Burton turned into a soulless Disney yes man since Alice in Wonderland, and it&#39;s the actual sad part in this movie

Dumbo ️️️️️️️️️️
Why did this make me cry?

Lord knows I love me some Dumbo, but this movie could of been way better.  Expected more from Tim Burton.  The whole Dreamland was so fake.  And the casting sucked!!!  But Baby Dumbo was adorable.

Hello i am from mauritius and i like his trailer film i want to watch this film any suggestion for a site ??

Anyone here After Elephant Incident in kerala

one of the worst movies ever

A lovely movie

What a piece of garbage...Just like alladin and king leon.

When the looting starts

This movie was fantastic and unencumbered expectation of what it <b>should</b> be and <b>could</b> be totally deflated the reaction that the film truly had. Earnest and sweet. Wondrous and triumphant. Like the best of Burton&#39;s films akin to Big Fish. The most honest of the heart of Disney&#39;s live-action adaptations. A shame so many wrote-it-off. This is why we can&#39;t have nice things. Because we take a film made with care and a sense of magic and kindness, and say it isn&#39;t good enough.

Super

<a href="">0:41</a> kids acting nowadays............ my gosh

When is the trailer of The One and Only Ivan coming?

BRUH IT COMES UP AS 15A

Wow

suddenly, Physics is nothing

Llklii
So Batman and the Penguin are reunited.

I want to see it but but I don’t want to watch the sad pets cause I know I’m going to cry 

Fortunately, the public is increasingly realizing how cruel animal circuses are. There are so many ways to entertain ourselves without harmfully exploiting our fellow sentient species!

i really loved this movie its has melt my heart

Excellent extraordinary movie directed by Tim Burton I really get tears when dumbo is get separated from her mother Jumbo but it is an excellent movie and a good ending the most emotional is saying her mother as a mad elephant dumbo is trying to meet her mother but an excellent ending is been presented really a good story the two childrens are very looking so pretty and cute excellent cinema

Dumbo is great
Could have given Dumbo a voice-over in a child actor, as elephants are remarkably intelligent... could have made the magic feather come from a wing-clipped macaw (replacing the Crows).

Slippery, damp, moist.. dancing and singing

When I was in Thailand, I saw how they treated an elephant.. They&#39;re being force to work.. They&#39;re so skinny.. Unlike we usually see in TV, more bigger and fat.. But this one got lots of scars on their body.. Its even sad in real life.. 

I cried during the film. But really happy for the ending.. Such a wonderful film. Thanks for making it a happy ending.. Such a gud film... Love DUMBO.. Cutee...

The clown makeup on Dumbo&#39;s face  !!!! No, thanks. Im not watching this

This movie is so beautiful...️

ALL THE THING IS BELIEF

I’m watching the real dumbo

Dumbo is very cute

That&#39;s literally touching

Sukanti Paul
Went to see this with my aunt and uncle and my aunt cried for most of the movie and I almost cried cause dumbo is so cute and how they took his mom away from him is so sad and wrong. Circus animals should be treated better and fairly

DUMBO AND  MOTHER  ARE SO SO SO SOOO CUTEEEE
<a href="">0:53</a> mufasa u live bro
Is Timothy in this movie?

Lol fake muscles the bike awaith 

Dumbo is not even the main character in this remake, and where is the mouse? And the crows that helps him fly? There is none of it. It was a bad remake because they made it more complicated than it really is. The best thing about the originals is that they told a heartwarming and deep story without having to put 3000 twist plots in it and having major problems all the time. This was overrated and I am personally very disappointed in the long awaited outcome.

I Watched the movie  it&#39;s soHAPPYHAPPYHAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPYHAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPYHAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY

Dumbo is my favorite movie
I Regret,that we didn&#39;t watch it in Theater.

Dumbo nama from jumbo circus of india which started in 1977

What the hell I started crying at the trailer I definitely won’t make it through the movie

Download Link <a href="">

Meanwhile in the real world - elephants continue to be slaughtered to near extinction to satisfy the Chinese market for ivory. Pity Disney doesn&#39;t publicise that fact.

Not really a “kid” movie but

  Gift Idea!!! Seriously, love this movie.  <a href="">0:39</a>    
this is fire

Ive only just now realized how disturbing this movie and the original is

Dumbo is definitely the correct answer!

who&#39;s my hero to tell me the name of the song\music playing from <a href="">1:30</a> ?????

half a#¤%d spoiler commentary and thoughts to &quot;dumbo&quot;/the Medici circus/the Farrier family the &quot;live&quot; action remake that should´ve been a sequel...

dumbo´s another remake that´s subpar to the original, i know real-ish looking animals don´t talk but i think it´s really what´s missing from the 

movie.. and his little mouse friend which´s non existent... exchanging him for the kids?.. it´s ok to show the human parts of the circus but you 

could´ve kept the animal parts as well. selling his mom?.. f#¤%´s that about?.. taking away &quot;her&quot; song and the tender moment between dumbo and 

her... how about keeping everything with the animals from the cartoon and keeping some of the things with the humans from the live action version.. 

right now it´s complete opposites.. the cartoon´s about the animals and the live action´s about the humans... why not skip calling it dumbo and 

either give it the name of the circus or the family that the movie seems to be about... it´s laking the soul of the cartoon... also why not just 

make the live action a sequel to the cartoon that begins right after?.. selling the mom in the beginning and then introducing the bad guys and it 

wouldn´t be a problem, just skip telling the parts from the cartoon... have dumbo flying from the beginning. the audience could´ve watched the 

movies back to back. the cartoon´s only an hour long anyway... why waste yours and the audiences money?.. i don´t get it... also dumbo should´ve 

been drunk out of his mind hallucinating those elephants. no one else saw them, apart from the non existing mouse perhaps. most of it seems to be 

a sequel anyway so why even include bits from the cartoon?.. just stupid... also if it´d been a sequel more about the humans it wouldn´t have 

mattered as much if the animals didn´t talk. still missing the mouse though... but you´re based in hollywood and all studios in hollywood´re 

running thin on ideas... next time you think remake throw water into your faces and go sequel! instead, or prequel in some cases. and why so much

focus on the feathers?.. he learns to let go of the feather in the cartoon fairly quickly... i´m glad i haven´t bought many of the remakes, don´t 

think i´m gonna buy more of them either... i´m good with the og cartoons. think it´s the only way to get anyone to make sequels and prequels instead

of remakes, to not buy their crap... makes them work harder at coming up with new things instead of just treading water. did dumbo live happily ever 

after, a flying elephant in the wild... that´s not worth anything... if you haven´t seen the cartoon than do that instead of watching this version. last, mostif not all of disneys easter eggs´re so dumb... some visible others only seen when they point it out themselves.... and they think they´re so clever.........

It&#39;s so cute

Dumbo 2019 April 19, 2019
Great comedy

April 19, 2019

Though it didn&#39;t do well at the box office,i loved this movie. I adored it. It&#39;s mine favourite Disney remake.   Hats off to Great Tim Burton sir.

Just watched this beautiful masterpiece 

Disney is only making remakes because they can&#39;t think of any new ideas but still want to get that cha-ching. If that&#39;s not sad I don&#39;t know what is.

Halfway through the movie and already starting to hate Milly. I gotta feeling they ruined this movie.

This movie was horrible

this film provides a lesson so that we no longer watch the circus and treat animals as best we can,,,,,, i reallllyyyy realllyy realllly loveeeee thiss filmmm

Mariah man
I don&#39;t care for Tim Burton movies. There, I said it.

Yay️️
Dumbest Disney ever!!! This depressing failure of a remake made for... Who??? Please don&#39;t say children, they didn&#39;t even bother to put Timothy Mouse in this shitthole movie

Burton's magic is over
so no crows?
dumbo is a elephant

Dumbo barely felt like a protagonist in this movie.Thr girl actress&#39; acting was lifeless tbhThe boy can be written out of the story and nothing would&#39;ve changed.

What happened to the crows? Cops shoot em?? 

Aww

Boring

RELEASE THE FULL AURORA TRACK! 
I saw the trailer whe it was first released, but I never knew it was already shown in theaters.

I cried two times in the cinema and I’m still cryin

Unfortunately another movie that looks interesting, decent and even good in the trailer but once you see it... Meh.

I love Disney and I love animals. But I don&#39;t understand how is everyone so in love with this movie. It was awful! It was boring as hell and the acting... Jesus. I feel like I wasted hours of sleep. How can you cry with this? I didn&#39;t feel anything, just cringe.

<a href="">

I looke tis in kino and am crying

Frankly I was expecting more from this movie because dumbo is such an epic but I cannot deny the movie was insanely sentimental

If you have seen the original, don&#39;t waste your time on this, it will leave you disappointed!

The vegans watching 

lol

watefak

Burton wanna massacre a concept? Thanks comment section I wont watch this.

Team Dumbo 1941

Doug Walker and i have something in common we enjoyed this movie more than most people

Even with such well-made films, must not in any way promote, support, advertise and tolerate any circus, show or the like in which any kind of ANIMALS are abused, used, trained, coached, keep in captivity and humiliated at all!

gg dambo

This movie is so terrible

Excelent movie for republicans to masturbate

I cried during the Original movie, when Dumbo and his mother were separated.  And I’m sobbing over the trailer. I don’t think I can see this movie. 

Please Tim Burton do movie SnowWhite.  Cinderella. AliBaba. Sleepy hollow ².  Edward ²  feat Johnny Depp. We love your works  imagination

Nice try Tim Burton your not fooling anyone you are about as family friendly as nightmare on elm street

I already saw it, the movie is very beautiful but I have an idea that such a bamboo that dumbo bambi and king lion that the movie 2019 already took it marked my childhood

I couldn&#39;t stop crying

I love you dumbow you are so cute 

I love the movie but the only problem is... there is no talking animals. Like why not make the elephants talk. Disney should stop making animals look realistic and make it more accurate like the classics. Give animals some facial expressions and the ability to talk.

I don&#39;t think I can emotionally watch this. :(

Just got added to Disney+ (Nov 3d)

Funny thing
I really liked dumba
It takes a special kind of stupid to think it&#39;s ok animals in circus or any other form of profit.

Winnie the Pooh Easter egg <a href="">00:58</a>

oops i dropped my monster condom that i use for my magnum dong

YA NO APARECE EL RATÓN THE MOUSE

The film’s gloomy storyline and setting took away its element of fantasy. It’s supposed to be a feel good movie like Alladin but with the depiction of loss, poverty and animal cruelty, it resonates negatively to the viewers,  emitting a depressing feeling. That’s the tragedy and flopdoom of this movie.

This movie is I love this movie I really enjoy it. All Disney movies that are remakes are all niceNice movie DUMBO!!thanks DISNEY!

THE LION WASN&#39;T IN THE MOVIE

Tears are…
Thank you disney..

Fuck

Hi mudafuckers fuck u mikey mouse i don&#39;t give a shit about u
I want a Dumbo corner at Disneyland. Will my dreams come true?
Eh. Tim Burton was better when he had no budget and had to get creative.

Everyone in the comments crying over a CGI elephant that flies.

I watched Dumbo 2019
very nice view

The new Dumbo reboot was at least more original than the new Lion King reboot.

heart touchie

i see this and i see big fish his touch in all his movies are so rare but yet his idk how to explain it like u can tell its a film by him ...&lt;3 true genius

I met Finley HobbinsBtw he’s joe
Aurora&#39;s voice is absolute! ️️
Superb movie  
I swear I had tears in my eyes
Music 
This is the kinda trailer you’ll come back to in a years time or less

This movie absolutely SUCKED <b>BALLS!</b>  I reckon they&#39;ll probably destroy Bambi next.

Here after Bill Burr told us about how he thought this was a kid&#39;s movie

Thank you Disney for making my childhood come to life again. This movie will always be my favorite. I can relate so much to dumbo and the pain of having his mother taken away. I was separated from my parents at a young age. I often felt like I was trapped in a cage looking through a whole wishing to be left free. This movie brings me so much joy I can&#39;t even put in words. Love you Walt Disney for all the beautiful and amazing things you have brought to my life.- Thank you from a little kid who grew up wishing for a family.

Ok, so is it just me, or was I the only one who did not cry? I’m one of those people who are nostalgic, and I honestly didn’t care for the movie whatsoever. It is absolutely nothing like the old one, and I know it wasn’t meant to be a photo copy of it, but... I still didn’t care for it. I almost feel like Disney is trying too hard to bring back old cherished movies, and it seems like they are trying to “fix” them. If they aren’t broke, do not try to fix them. From Jungle Book to Marry Poppins... Disney needs to stop while they are ahead. Sorry for all the negativity, but that’s just how I feel about the new era of old animated and non animated movies.

Danny devito? Sign me up
Hi

Hi

How cute the baby is
DiANA

<a href="">#DisneyAvariciousBot</a>. That sad, cuz I love ur cartoons when I was young child. Sad.

Ginoelian

Fucking dumbo because of you shitty movie they roast me bulin stupid
Cannot wait for a chance to see this! I&#39;d never heard of it. I cry even watching the old animated movie. Can&#39;t wait to, like the other commenter said, die crying through a gorgeous reboot of DUMBO the baby elephant.

Disney showing kids how to become an autistic victim as an adult instead of a leader. ‍️

Aladdin and the Lion King Masterpiece is simply divine
Out of all the remakes Disney is coming out with, I think this one is by far the best.And am I the only one that cries at the Baby of Mine song???

I cried at the movie theater
Am I the only one who cried with this trailer? Omg. I will watch it.

I find it boring

Rubsh

I must say: my daughter did not like that the pink elephants letter was missing

We'll see after 1 2 3 bye
Bill Burr brought me here

Theres was no expression on the kids face when they found out.. dumbo can fly

Perfect movie
I like Dumbo
I watcht this movie and i cried so <b>hard</b> 

I love adult Disney, f the kids.

Movie was so friggin forgettable that everyone forgot it existed.

Ok but did anyone suddenly just burst into tears at <a href="">1:35</a> ? Like what the heck??

Disney should&#39;ve released all of the original movies instead of wasting everyones time and money with all the live action crapathons.

That girl who play  Milly ruin the show next time find kid that can act alright?

I don&#39;t comment negatively on much but - the CGI looks just awful.  Why does everything need to be dumbed down and given human eyes?! The original Dumbo film wasn&#39;t particularly good (nostalgia makes it a little more bearable) - but why everything needs an awful &#39;live action&#39; remake I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not even &#39;live action&#39;. it&#39;s 100% CGI!

Make snowwiwhit 2

watched the original this week

I came here because AURORA

Looks nice
Such a sentive heart that i have,  my eyes come out  tear! beatiful film.

lol I saw the movie in a airplane good thing I was lucky ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This is the cutest movie ever!

This film gives two reflections 1: Every living being is capable of doing things despite our difficulties 2: It shows the dark side of humanity, no living being, absolutely no one should be humiliated or mistreated, for the amusement of us humans, they They are like us, a different species but we are unique in this world, we must care for and respect every living being, animals are innocent, do not hurt or humiliate them, it is seriously very sad to see Dumbo painted as a clown while the public laughs at him , I would like to be there to unpaint his face, but it is sadder to see that this actually happens on our planet!!! They arrived first and deserve respect, we are only secondary in this world, we are invaders...Let's love and respect any animal we see.
I dont have See this movie :(

Pfff... circusses (?) without animals are the best cuz you see real &quot;magic&quot; instead of animals forced into things.

This movie is amazing 

I love it ️️
lawl i didnt even know this remake existed, let alone came out already. holy shit

super great work
YouTube full movie panamudiytha

Just finished watching the movie oh my fucking god that was easily the best movie I have ever watched from the start animal abuse to little guy losing his mamma and fighting to find her again wow good job Collin farrel easily the best movie you have ever played in truly touched my heart simple amazing

Me and my grand daughter is going to see this movie

I haven&#39;t watched the movie yet. But if it was that sad and great, why is the movie&#39;s box office so terrible, like only 2 times the budget:(((

I gotta be honest, this movie didn&#39;t make me cry as much as the cartoons. But this was such a great movie. As far as I&#39;m concerned Dumbo is better than Aladdin. Atleast this Dumbo captured its heart it gave justice to the cartoons. So many movies got snobbed this year, Dumbo, Alita, godzilla, detective Pikachu, Shazam.

Baby mine dont you cry.
Can I make a little contribution to the director please .. I&#39;ll be happy to..this movie is incredible...

Beautiful movie.. no words...will go down as one of the best family entertainers in the history...

Yeah, Disney, this sucked. Stop before you ruin all your classics.

When i see an elephant fly

Does&#39;nt matter how small, he&#39;s a fucking baby. Yeah its like, i thought you&#39;d be taller

Saw it in theatres at the beginning of April and watching it right now at home on Blu-ray. Prepared to cry all over again.

Tip guysIf u ever watch this movie u better have thousands of tissuesI never have even one so i warn u After this u will have a pool

Nah I didn&#39;t cry....where&#39;s my bravest man award!? 

Saw this movie, it didn’t even feel like dumbo. I was honestly disappointed and I know you can’t have the crows but that didn’t even make it dumbo.

Disney sucks.
Missing an arm <a href="">2:05</a> ?

Dumbo is so cute

cc

This music already has me crying with only a few chords

Great, I'll definitely watch it

So cute

I can&#39;t believe Timothy only had a small cameo and didn&#39;t have a big role can we please start a conversation about that, please?

the saddest part is Rufus&#39;s death

<a href="">0:25</a> timothy? Is that you?

Damn all this comments about crying through the whole movie is the reason why I still didn&#39;t watch the movie yet...

This was so good I loved it

Ja to chorando

Bruh, the mouse doesn’t even talk!

Did you know?&quot;In January 2017, it was announced that Will Smith was in talks to play the father of the children who develop a friendship with the lovable elephant after seeing him at the circus.&quot;Thank goodness for scheduling conflicts lol.

The saddest movie I’ve ever watched...i literally cried so many times in the spectacular movie.

<a href="">#ReleaseTheAuroraCut</a>

I ️️️ Dumbo
Watching this with my kids right now.....ish is mad stupid yo.

This made me sad. I know they use animals in Circus&#39; it makes me sick. They treat them poorly. Sucks!!

I loved this movie!

Critics are idiots! Loved the movie ️

I have dumbo doll

Beautiful film , very underrated.

I dont know about dumbo I&#39;m just waiting on the joker

I.  Saw.    This.  Movie.  Its. So.  Cute.

tim burton thank you for ruining yet another childhood movie i dispise you

Please save animals from zoos and circus, animals are being savagely mistreated there :((

Netflix doesn’t even have this I’m done

This broke my heart as a kid when he was separated  from his mom because my mom was a drug addict in and out of prison.  It was such a traumatizing movie to me that i hated watching it.

And I put the name wrong and now people, if you don't know how to read Portuguese, no problem, see?
I love Dopey He is very cute when he was born very little and his eyes are very beautiful and I also loved the film I was watching at my friend's house in it my mother's friend's husband so he was able to download it To watch, it wasn't very cool and I'm also going to watch the rest in the cinema, okay, I'm also going to watch Toy Story, which is really cool too
AURORA needs to do all moviesongs
My grown ass cried while watching this movie now i want a dumbo for myself

Pity  him don&#39;t do like det ok 
Prefer the cartoon film.

i just realized (whyyyyyy) baby mine in the trailer is sung by the lovely Aurora

small elephants with excessively large ears can not fly as their ears would not support the body weight

Why isn&#39;t the mouse in the movie??

Elephant flying hahaha
Loved the movie but I kinda hated the little girl&#39;s expressionless acting lol

Guacht
I went to see the Dumbo movie in the cinema and another thing, am I the only one who speaks Spanish?

I really enjoyed the movie, Disney doesn’t really put out a bad “Disney movie” in my opinion. I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.

Aka Ahbaal, Aboush/ Idiot, Dangerous

Beautiful trailer. Well done. I’ll watch it if I have a chance but I wouldn’t mind this being my last impression of the movie as it gave me chills.

What happened to Burton movies?

Love it

Cool I&#39;ll watch it

Ch
Subscribes please to my by now 
I have seen the movie today. Spoiler alert for those who haven&#39;t seen it yet. It was better than I expected! And after seeing so many good responses on the movie I already had high expectations. But Disney has outdone itself. Instead of just making a remake they reimagined the whole story leaving most elements although some were altered (although Timothy was shown as a white mouse in his suit in a cage his role was replaced by the kids, a lot of his lines were now done by the kids) and adding a whole extra storyline to it. That explains why it&#39;s twice as long as the original. I did find it funny that the ending was completely different. I wouldn&#39;t have minded if they would have left it intact. I mean, the original was made in the early 40s and the movie sets place around that time era and they weren&#39;t busy with integrating circus animals back to nature in that time, but then again I guess they have to choose political correctness for the crybabies who feel offended by the original movie. And yes I am very much for treating animals well and if possible getting circus animals back to nature or good sanctuaries. But I also understand that our knowledge about animals and animal cruelty has increased over the years and that what seems cruel to us (like a misunderstood mother and baby elephant now being the VIP&#39;s of the circus, yet still part of the circus, because of the baby&#39;s success during the show) wasn&#39;t perceived as cruel in the 40s. Thank God for the increase of our knowledge. But even if in this movie they hadn&#39;t send Dumbo and his mom back home into the wild I would have completely understood. It&#39;s something that would happen in 2019. Not in the 40s in which the movie takes place. Beautiful ending nonetheless, but I found it a little bit unnecessary to have a completely altered ending that doesn&#39;t fit in the image of the 40s. If they would have ended it with Dumbo and Jumbo now being counted as full family of the circus and treated well, it would have been okay with me. Not that this new ending isn&#39;t okay or beautiful, but unnecessary in my opinion.

Love this movie 

Tim Burton shows up and gets a paycheck. Should he give a shit? He probably does not if this film or Alive in Wonderland or whatever the fuck shits he dids the past 20 years. All these movies are for suckers.

Waiting......!!!!for this.

<a href="">#NotMyDumbo</a>

They always want more money, poor things, people are ashamed of animals, taking advantage of animals, that's why it's other things, Bullying is growing, but it's more
Omg, i’m already crying by just watching the trailer-

Best most saddest movie ever.
Just saw the trailer, the movie isn’t even released yet and I’m already crying!!! Looking forward to watching this movie soon️

Thanks for the spoilers-all you people who said you cried...Now I know I&#39;m going to.

The trailer only whispers of the emotions to come.

I&#39;m not sure if I want to pay and cry during this movie 

I love This Movie I love Dumbo 

NO! were my &quot;rat&quot; pesone from dem cartoon also the bubble makes pink eles a rephrence to dumb bo get don did drink

The theater is now filled with adults.

Dumbo the movie forerver

Cute

I&#39;m in tears    <a href="">#loveelehants4life</a>
Please release the soundtrack. Not baby mine song. The soundtrack is so amazing

movie sucks
The whole point of Dumbo was how he was alone and pushed through it but by the looks of the trailer the kids help him get his mom back not Dumbo

I&#39;m glad to see Danny DeVito reprising his role from Big Fish.

Me: Oh you are dumbo right?Dumbo: YOU DARE CALL ME DUMB!!!
Dumbo was the most disappointing thing since my son

I hope they do a sequel to this Dumbo made me pretty upset when they separated him from his mum in this movie is so sad just like the Original movie at least they were happily reunited and sit back into the wild

AURORA!!!!

&quot;Fly, Dumbo.. fly...&quot;

Well the last movie doesnt matter much anymore but what were going to see today is the real question

Congratulation$350 millions

Fly dumbo! Fly!

<a href="">0:53</a> I think we just saw our first Lion King reference

You know what I have to say about dumbo 2019 this 

Was any part of this scary? Trying to decide if our kids will like it or get scared. Sometimes Tim Burton makes things a little dark.

this is the real dumbo <a href="">

Who else is happy that they made this movie? &#39;-&#39;

is that danny devito

superbbb film

Byes
awesome video. very good channel.welcome to my channel for nice cartoon drawing video.

This trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice

I saw it in the cinema
this was a good movie

Cried at how ugly this movie is, I’m disappointed in Tim burton

There 
The end sad? (I would like to see the movie but i have to know first if the end is sad) Text to me back please 

I get imotional and then cried.. Awesome feeling

Love you mom

Only love and peace make world better for live

i legit forgot this movie existed lmao

I saw picture of dumbo somewhere and thought this shit was from horror movie

Who needs a dragon when we have DUMBO 

In Loving Memory Of Walter Elias “Walt” Disney (12/5/1901-12/15/1966)

Oh my gosh the TRAILER almost made me tear up. Imma be sobbing in the theater and not giving a f*** 

Who&#39;s here because of Bill Burr?

We saw this movie last night and we thought it would be kind of boring but it was Great! Worth watching our two year old son watched it as well ️

YOU CAN DO IT DUMBO WE ALL BELIEVE IN YOU! YOU CAN FLY!!!
Dumbo made me cry at 3 yrs old when the 1991 VHS tape was released and it will make me cry again at 31 years old when I see Tim Burton&#39;s version. Damn it dumbo ilysm

Itz so sad yes its only the trailer but I’m crying all those people who disliked it is a dumbo plus don’t make fun of her when she has the clown face paint

I&#39;ve watched this and it was beautiful!!! 

This movie looks sad as fuck. Why would you pay to do that to yourself? I&#39;ll save you the time and money. &quot;Circuses are not what they appear on to be the surface.&quot; &quot;Animals are magical in of themselves, without having to be jazzed up. Leave them be.&quot;

I love this movie it made me cry When they separated Dumbo from his mum just like in the original movie but there are some bits in this film similar to the original and not And  the song baby mine reminds me of me and my mum she is Staying with my sister for awhile but I miss her so much and I love the movie tomorrow and I cannot wait for it to come on DVD

Dumbo is.a very good movie

Disney you think your slick in the scene where the momma elephant is caged and her name on the sign is “Kali the Destroyer”. Kali, the destroyer Goddess...  and how she turned on her Kali- Ma alter destroying everything . Aleister Crowley, and his evil, chaotic beliefs. I knew it the second I saw it.

I saw this movie today and I admit I really loved it up to the point I completely forgot it was a Tim Burton movie it just doesn&#39;t seem like something he&#39;d direct

Seeing that poor animal’s face pained like a clown makes me so fucking sad and ashamed as a human being . Makes me so sad that it would be in my mind forever. teach your children that animals belong to the nature . They didn’t came here to be our entrainment or food. GO VEGAN 

Nico Parker is the prettiest Girl on this planet

im just home from the film so cool

I would never go to any zoos again

I watched the movie last night with my friend

 omg
Best movie ever,
Dumbo’s toots is 100000 time cuter than Puppies!

Love dunbo
I watched this in the cinema and I just want to say how upsetting and touching it is. It’s almost like you know what dumbo is going through

I watched this movie yesterday and it was heart breaking but it&#39;s such a good movie

fuck disney
This movie made me: cry

I watched this movie today and a little girl asked her mom&quot; is that an Octopus&quot;? <a href="">1:45</a>

It is. Best film. That has happened and for anyone. Person or children me. I saw it. I know them. I recommend to everyone. What the hell
When dumbo had clown face paint I thought we should treat  animals  how they are  not for entertainment

So sad omg
