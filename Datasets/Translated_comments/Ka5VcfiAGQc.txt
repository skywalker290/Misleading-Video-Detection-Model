Click bait…you win this round. Thanks for nothing.

People need to stop creating false narratives that animals like bears, orcas, pandas, hippos, walruses are cute.  These animals are at or near the top of their food chain.  They dont go hunting and looking for their food.  They let their prey come to them.  They are animals and their life is dependant on their natural survival instincts, hunger, and threat detections.  If you are one or all of these things, you risk getting killed ar any given time.

Am I the only Russian?
It&#39;s a joke that we try to control these majestic beasts and very sad that we try to do it.

SCAM FRAUD

fuckyouand your clickbait bullshit , are you THAT desperate ?

Not to seem bloodthirsty, but where&#39;s the whale killing the trainer int eh video?  And ever moreso- what a horrible choice of music.

<a href="">#endseaworld</a>

No way in hell you used the free willy music

Our Creator created us humans and such wonderful animals. But certainly not for people taking the right to lock up and torture these animals. 😢
“Based on my personal experience with whales and dolphins in the wild and my observations of these magnificent animals in captivity, I believe there is no justification for allowing them to be used as performers in theme park shows and that breeding them in captivity to sustain a captive population solely for entertainment and profit is unacceptable. The concept of watching cetaceans perform tricks in theme parks is anti educational and is inhumane. These are animals that live in family pods for their whole lives with life spans similar to our own. Capturing whales and dolphins for entertainment and profit forces them to live in artificial families, in spaces that are insufficient, and rewards them with food for doing tricks they do not do in the wild.Today, we have the interactive film and video technology to show cetaceans in the wild to audiences around the world. For the amount of money a family spends to go to an animal park, they can have an on the water experience seeing whales in their natural environment. It is long past due for us as a thinking and caring human species to adopt and require practices that respect whales and respect their right to live in their natural wild environment.Anywhere on the planet we are connected to the ocean. We have the opportunity to do what needs to be done to protect our life support system and improve the quality of life not just of the marine environment – of the marine mammals -- but for ourselves. This is the choice we have. If we protect the ocean, we protect ourselves.&quot; ~ Jean-Michel Cousteau&quot;There&#39;s about as much educational benefit studying dolphins [and whales] in captivity as there would be studying mankind by only observing prisoners held in solitary.&quot; ~ Jacques Cousteau&quot;Whales and dolphins, like chimpanzees, are highly intelligent and intensely social creatures, forming close emotional bonds between family and group members. I have watched them leap in the freedom of the ocean and feel deeply saddened and angered to see them in cruel captivity, swimming endlessly and hopelessly around their sterile concrete prisons. As David Kirby so eloquently documents in this timely work, whale and dolphin captivity only benefits the captors. It is impossible to read “Death at SeaWorld “ and come to any other conclusion.” ~ Dr. Jane Goodall&quot;A Fall From Freedom&quot; <a href=""> original &quot;Blackfish&quot;)&quot;Blackfish&quot; <a href=""> tank is a bad thing.&quot; Please listen to Ric O&#39;Barry&#39;s moving message regarding &quot;The Cove&quot; and Cathy (who was also known as &quot;Flipper&quot;):  Paul Spong of OrcaLab: &quot;Reasons to end cetacean captivity at aquariums and marine parks.&quot; <a href=""> Ingrid Visser and John Hargrove (ex senior trainer) visit SeaWorld 10/7/15 <a href=""> opinion — and thus potential customers — are moving inexorably toward greater rights for animals and away from watching captives jump through hoops.

Worst video ever!!!
too bad dont care

Glad I checked the comments first😂😂😂 ya&#39;ll be easy✌🏾☠️

Nothing happened in the vid???

Ridiculous.

Nice fucking music choad.

The titel does not show the content. It is just a way to get your click.

Such a precious 1 minute waste of my time, clickbait for certain🤬🤬🤬
I reported your video
Lol, since when is a pelican a trainer?

Hi

click bait
lol the music is throwing it off 😂

So where is the attack dickhead….

Clickbait... much?!
Highly disappointed

it’s bette r for it not to be real

Bro the whale didnt even show up

Stop going to these shows u idiotsStop torturing innocent animals

Shame never did that. LOL

The song is making this so much sadder

And to think they still do these shows

Been noticing a lot of false titles on you tube lately, here watch this video that has absolutely nothing on it.

click bait
dislikes disabled by owner. fuckin pussy

What is this goofy ahh music

FUCK!! HEY ASSHOLES STOP 🛑 GOING TO SEE CAPTIVE FUCKEN ORCAS AT THESE HORRIFIC HEINOUS PARKS……STOP GOING PERIOD!
Lying

Clickbait piece of shit

SHIT...MUSIC TO KILL BY   PATHETIC

This is the incident that ended the Pelican as an Orca trainer program.

She abuse the animal that orca don&#39;t deserve this!

Nothing happened!

Clickbait. don&#39;t bother watching

every day that an orca kills a human is a good day and we are closer to doing justice to these amazing creatures for having stolen them from the sea

Dam

That title is so misleading. No trainer killed. Just another boring animal abuse show at Sea World. Very disappointing.

damn 13 year

This video sucks, no one dies in it. 👎

Wait, I saw a whole video and as far as I know, it was not the trainer, but a pelican! The bird sat down on the water, while one of the orcas succesfully ambushed it and roamed around the pool with it&#39;s corpse in it&#39;s mouth. The guts also belong to the pelican, as you might guess.

I’m on shamos side
Nobody even gets attacked in this

The whale is traumatized every day of their life in a &quot;bathroom sized area&quot; where they live and they have to perform these stupid tricks which is not normal for a whale in order to be fed.  You people who go see these &quot;shows&quot; are part of their abuse. Stop going and they&#39;ll shut them down and then the whales and dolphins can live in their natural habitat.  DON&#39;T YOU CARE?

People may see this as, “innocent trainer gets attacked by killer whale.” Well, I see this as, “Innocent killer whale attacks a killer human.” Because SeaWorld killed 40 orcas, and continue to do this to these animals. Free the orcas already!

Not even the real attack that killed trainer. This attack was at Florida and He lived, Thank God!!

Damn.....Thats one minute and a half im never getting back in life

Song says YOU ARE MY FRIEND

Orcas were never meant to be kept in captivity especially if they are old and too big to be caught in the first place

all i saw was someone swimming ._.

You idiot

Imagine making money off clickbait/lies and YouTube is okay with it. But when conservatives speak out about corruption, they get banned and silenced.

Report fake video then blacklist

Stupid people they ruined ewrything on this Planet orcas DONT belong to Swimmingpool 🤢

Clickbait piece of shit

Wtf???

*hello guys*
Im confuse
There are just two orcas that were confirmed to kill humans, both in captivity, named Tilikum (3 ☠️) and Keto (1 ☠️)

Spending time....

Good job shamu. You do what all animals do. Kill what endangers you. Your sufferings opened our eyes. We will never forget you.

Yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir this is what I needed

well done killer whale

R.I.P

Don&#39;t blame orcas, sharks they get tiny food, horrible loud music in there ear and forced to do stupid tricks medieval whether born in captivity or taken stolen from sea, taken stolen from mum some were as a baby and then you force a traumatic lonely creature to please you and because of greed and no kindness Control freaks, these creatures are intelligent and aware you are taking advantage of them and they know what you have done, the shows are ancient ( release to sanctuary)yo are disrespecting them without self awareness that they belong in the sea, they are not your family,  there family is in the sea, they are not yours

Dumb video.  Dumb music

clickbait
Good that &#39;ll teach those idiots, that they are named like that for a reason , their not called poodle whales

Ban kids on YouTube.. too much click bait 🤦

ur videos suck ....u suck at life
most successful click bait ever
This video was cut, and the killer whale doesn&#39;t kill a trainer it kills a live pelican. The full video is up on YouTube and you&#39;ll be able to see that what he was doing is taking out the remains of the pelican because the whles didn&#39;t eat it all, and just left parts of the pelican in the water

clickbait 🐟
hi did not die
Is shamu still alive
this is close to ear rape

the background music😂😂

bastards
This was a good 1 min waste of my time I could have been playing with my cat oh btw I went to sea world if anyone cares

The Orcas did not kill anyone it was a pelican. Also, this happened I believe in 2006. Although, in 2010 they did get another pelican.

Too scary

Stupid

This is fake no one died

Clickbait alert!
Click bait
He doesn&#39;t even get killed
whats the song called?

Click bait
I&#39;m 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

No one died 🙄
THERES NO DEAD TRAINER!!! 😤😤😤😤😡😡😡😩😩😩
Wtf was that shit no one died

It says the video of the Shaun killing the trainer in the db

Amazing song choice ;)
This is when it attacked a Pelican that landed on the water, consequently receiving a mauling to pieces.

Picking up the body parts of the trainer the whale killed

Stupid

I never seen no trainer die !! 😠
yeah

it did not kill him

Song??

The original video is shamu killing a pelican that was in the water

This is the most dumbest shit video I&#39;ve ever seen this shit isn&#39;t even about shamu killing the fucking trainer get a job and get your fuckin vids straight you dam lunitic

Click bait!!!!!!!!
Fake

Everyone. A Trainer did Die though. They didn&#39;t get it on Camera. because all of the Trained Whales are Trained by Touch and Sense, Shamu didn&#39;t know that Hair Sense. One of the Trainers didn&#39;t have their hair up and Shamu thought Hair was a Threat so he Ate his Trainer

I&#39;ve seen the real video it just killed a bird

me either
thats shamu way of say fuck you

everybody go look at shamu kills pelican
the placement of this song in video is awesome... this song is meant to be whale... it&#39;s not love song! MICHAEL JACKSON is the one who wrote this song to save whale from hunting.

Fuck Sea world. End it.Legally end sea world.

he/she is just wanting views his lying

The trainer didn&#39;t die......stop lying.

we have been trolled

This is not a video of trainer being killed. This is video of when shamu attacked and ate a bird that was sitting on the water during a show.

This is from another video of a killer whale eating a pelican at the show!

<a href="">#lovethissong</a>!!!

Umm  this is when they killed a pelican... not a trainer XDD

This is clips from another video. They killed a pelican

HEY I DIDNT SEE NO TRAINER DIE!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
LIAR!!!!!!

this was where they killed a bird that landed on the water. what the guy retrieves and throws in the bucket was part of the birds wing.

this was where they killed a bird that landed on the water. what the guy retrieves and throws in the bucket was part of the birds wing.

I never saw the trainer die

Awwwww Michael!!!!!


How the ruck was he killed

The whale only killed a pelican in this video

This was the song from Free Willy

Animal has gayyy
All documents of the killings on video were destroyed. They even had one video of where tilikum lunged at a trainer and the canera guy was ordered to destroy the tape. Even tho no one. Got killed and he even edited it out they still said the tape was unusuable. Sea world gets rid of the vide evidence before it can be seen.

That&#39;s a pelican the whales killed cause I watched the video

you piece of shit,dont upload shit if you dont have the real footage

there&#39;s no likes and dislikes this was from 2010!

This is when Shamu killed the Pelican,  not the trainer. People and the trainers would freaking out more if he did kill the trainer

I say the same as many others. There was never in this video that Shamu killed its trainer. Maybe he did it, but not in this video.

Is this real?

Shut down sea world

He DIDINT kill him idiot 

He doesn&#39;t die idiot
Its a pelican and Tom the trainer is getting the rest of the Pelican they tore apart..

This is when they killed a pelican .

Is there any real vids of shamu killing his trainer cause im pist

Stupid fuck head go to hell your a complete piece of shit 

completely contrived video

Shamu didnt kill annyone

Shamu as well as other captive orcas HAVE killed their trainers in the past. This is because ORCAS DO NOT BELONG IN CAPTIVITY. THEY ARE PREDATORS AND YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO HUNT!

Just because it says &quot;killer whale&quot; it doesn&#39;t mean it kills humans it&#39;s a lie this video and all of the videos about killing the trainer is fake so flag this video

its not fake but seriously THEY ARE (KILLER) WHALE. YOU DONT GO SWIMMING W THEM! 

Nothing happened

Sucked in i say and its their own fuckin fault! I wish more shit like this happens!!! Then the so called experts here are saying the animal could&#39;ve been agitated blah blah fucking blah! Get that fuckwit and put him in a box for all his life to do tricks for a bunch of fuckwits everyday and see how he goes! Fuckin idiots!

If you want to watch the real video&#39;s, watch Blackfish (2013) The trainer that was feeding the Whale does actually get eaten.

me too

Life is too short to have our time wasted by stupid people

Same here. Sick and tired of misleading titles that are nothing more then a waste of my precious time...

yea well i to but apperantly youtube doesnt care about its clients



dafaq is ur prob\





flagged for spam

Actually,the guy trainer in this video is taking a dead bird out of the pool,the whale killed the bird,not the trainer.That happened to someone different so if your going to do this,at least get the right trainer in the video.

Stupid Video and also the Idiot who made this Video. 

fu#kthis video

1 They BELONG in the SEA 

2 Tiny Box yes compared to the SEA

3 They&#39;d die without survival skills WHERE IS YOUR BRAIN OR EMPATHY? Point 1 Leave them Alone THEY KNOW HOW TO SURVIVE in their NATURAL Habitat CALLED FREEDOM!

4  Tiger4meat 3 months ago This comment has received too many negative votes - well that says it All Really Your Single Useless Point is Pointless!

this whole video is a cliffhanger

Itsafucking pelican u moron
lmfao so true
no one died stupid vid


It&#39;s sir. You don&#39;t know much if you think they just live in that &quot;tiny&quot; glass box all their lives. They&#39;re able to move to different areas within the park, depending what aquarium they&#39;re from. You also ignored my point completely. They&#39;ll DIE if they are released into the wild. I&#39;m done trying to make my point again. There&#39;s not even any point in arguing with you anymore.

Reported and you should do the same - click the flag below the number of views

you can report it .. and I highly recommend it :) .

Video is reported just a few more guys and this peice of shit video will be removed

Report this video for a misleading title.

Report for misleading, the caption is intentionally wrong

shhhh.... its trying to communicate

Ugh that&#39;s clearly just extra food for the whales or else why is no one panicking

these handlers clearly care about these  amazing creatures.But thats where they get it wrong.Killer whales are intelligent sea predators that  should be treated  with due respect and should be free from captivity.

serves them right these beautiful creatures belong in the sea not a fish bowl for humane entertainment 

you can flag it &quot;Report&quot; for being &quot;Spam or misleading&quot;



I just did.

It was a pelican.  One of the orcas took a pelican floating in  their pool down,

it came up in pieces. This occurred in San Diego just days before the human fatality

in Florida.

Takes an idiot to know one! &quot;Raised&quot; imprisioned against their Will &quot;have Happy lives&quot; living in a see through tiny box? Animals are not abused &amp; these prisions &quot;educates us on what not to do in order to survive these situations&quot; You IGNORANT MORON how many humans spend most of their time out in the Ocean! They survive in their habitat but removed for decades of course they&#39;ll forget the basics point is LEAVE THEM ALONE FREEDOM oh My Grammar? How about FUCK YOU for your assumptions Regards Miss

Sir, or should I say &quot;idiot&quot; . . . If these animals were released into the natural habitat, they&#39;d most likely die due to not having survival skills. They were raised to have happy lives and entertain (and humans don&#39;t treat these animals like shit just for money . . . they treat and respect them as if they were their own child). Also, it&#39;s human nature and curiosity to see these types of videos . . . It educates us on what not to do in order to survive these situations.

Also... Grammar, please.

Rubbish, I want my 1.32 mins back!!

WAKE UP Is It Human Right TO BE THE ONLY FREE SPECIES ON EARTH?

All that Is Precious Declines &amp; What Rises an Abundance of Ignorant Brainwashed Humans All Each in their Own Bubble Blind &amp; Disconnected Yet Want Right, Freedom &amp; Entertainment to see a Person killed by an Imprisioned Tormented Whale Acting in Desperation?

Open ur Eyes ur Mind  &amp; Use them to See, Feel &amp; Question - Who U R? What U&#39;d Do in this scenario? For What? Why? Enslaved for Greed &amp; Entertainment. Is It RIGHT? Nooooooo

Total con, don&#39;t waste your time.

fake ... they killed a pelican -__-

This video is shit

do not watch!! go back!!!

GOD!! sick of fake vids

if your gona make a fake video at least make it a rick rolld 

you idiot stop wasting peoples time 



@barshkin I doubt your in a position to talk. Because the fact that you could point that out, meant that you infact... Watched it!

This is Normkangaroo&#39;s video, which was posted back in March of 2008.



To everyone: The killer whales killed and ate a pelican.

@barshkin 



Whats also funny is that you clicked on this video yourself..... WHAT A HYPOCRITE!!!!

...

some people must be stupid. If theres the word killer in it then it will kill.

The title should be whale gang bang

@barshkin well you watched it didnt you ?



Shamu SMAAAAAAAAAAAASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What&#39;s Up With The Music?

@barshkin i dont give a shit about your reason for the title. i just hate fucking liars. fuck you



R.I.P MJ and Dawn Brancheau

@barshkin Nothing, it&#39;s natural morbid fascination.

i remember i watched this whole thing five times to see the trainer die and i was 4 i was like FWUCK THWIS SHWIT BWITCH

This video is NOT from when Tilikum attacked the trainer, it is from another Sea World performance when one of the whales attacked a pelican. And furthermore, you cannot blame a whale for attacking a human, it is being an animal of it&#39;s own nature. It&#39;s instinct is that a human is getting in it&#39;s tank, invading it&#39;s space and posing a threat, and it needs to defend itself. That is what the  trainer&#39;s family and friends have continued to say, and insisted that she would have said, since her death

what a load of whale shit

shamu killed a pelican that landed on the water. there is another video on here that is like 9 mins long that shows the Orca grab the pilcan and 2 or 3 other whales take it under, drown it, then bring it back up and rip it to shreds 

who got killed noone



SHIT

@MegaBradley111 wish i could

If I had a dime for every Shamu, I would have enough money to BUY shamu

@xXFearlessCommandoxX ok then have fun

@MegaBradley111 not for me 

@TheGalaxyFan thats what i want to know?

@xXFearlessCommandoxX well when you want to do something thats a start but doing it is the hardest part

@MegaBradley111 forget about it i don&#39;t want to argue like that...im not that upset anyways...and i want thn to do something about them 

When did anybody or anything die?

@tapdancegirl88 Those were convictions love. Nothing was ever proved, nor was there any evidence. Just distasteful parents in a desperate attempt for money.

I just wasted another another minute and 32 seconds of my life .

the r called KILLAR whales theyre not pets

this is not this was the one with the bird the whale ate the bird 

man wen  i hurd mj it made me sad 

@nicolevmata thats why it was all over the news about SHAMU killing its trainer

fuckface

@ilovecub1 i didn&#39;t say they were...i just have a dislike for them 

@xXFearlessCommandoxX they aren&#39;t here to be used..

This video is a lie and they removed the ratings.  Can we have it removed?

hey dumbass.....it was cuz it ate a bird....

Well you probably would not get so many abusive remarks if your video even remotely contained what the title suggests.  phony 

@ringapowa9000 jjjj
@melody8024 

WTF is this shit!!



shamu dident kill the trainor it was a differnt whale

i like the song

Don&#39;t you know that there are some people that have exhausted all the porn on the internet &amp; now can only whack one out to the sight of someone actually getting maimed/killed. Do not post videos with a misleading title. SHAME ON YOU!!

.....this is when they killed the pelican during the show.....

wanna know why i know that?

I WAS THERE! nice try
ratings have been disabled.   booo on you!



what i find funny is how more than 4.5 million people have viewed something with a title like this......WHATS WRONG WITH US, WORLD????

shit video


This is a video segment from a longer video shot by Normkangaroo where during a show the killer whales attack a pelican the trainers are cleaning up the pelican not a person

yea, you&#39;re supposed to show the trainer getting killed if you&#39;re gonna put up a title like that...

thAT WAS AN ABSELOUTE COOOOOOOOOOOOOONNN WHAT A WASTE OF MY STUDY BRAKE

just wondering.. but what happened to the whale? is it still in sea world? relase it?

killed it??? :( 

Hello, reader. If you had started reading﻿ this, don&#39;t stop or else. I﻿ hate people who post these these kinds of comments but.... Post this to 16 videos in 30 minutes﻿ and promise your self to never listen to these kinds of comments or make one up. But this one is real. If you don&#39;t post this, a boy with no head and legs will show up in ur room at midnight kill you. Everyone will﻿ forget you. start posting. the time will start as soon as you finish reading this. yes﻿ I do hate these comments

poor

are u kiddin me? 80% of this video is some random dude swimming o.o

This is video of an incedent where the killer whales attacked and killed a pelican. Not a person. You see one of the trainers run off with the wing. 

@151megz I know what your getting at but sadly alot of people couldnt care less if they killed a beautiful specimen like this orca. Even tho there are charities set up they need soooo much money for it to have an effect on most orca&#39;s. I wish the orca&#39;s could roam freely but the world isnt full of loving and caring people you always get a heartless person who does cruel things for cash.

@willbeanz1 its cruel. Sadly all animals are at risk of hunters ect... but it would be a lot better if people actually cared about the well being of these whales and gave money to charitys that takes care of them while they are in their natural habitats. The Whales at seaworld are not free and although they may seem happy, they are not. Whales wernt brought in this world to be held captive.

@dianamp312 I can see your point and i know they would rather be free but people are still going out with harpoons and ending there lives for money. Its sad that its come to this but i think they are safer and more cared for in captive than out in the wild.

umm thats not a human thats a pelican that was in the rong place at the rong time T_T and yes i saw the real vid of this &gt;_&gt; and its not this made up crap about one of the orcas killing their trainer!

@123infomaniac  actaually it is not cruelty I was lucky enough to see the behind the scenes and quite frankly they get todo what ever they want! Before the show starts the whales are not forced to do anything they get trained and if they dont want to do it then they cant make them, overall after the show has finished they get put in a ginormous tank filled with fish and other specimens it is not cruelty

yea...that wasn&#39;t a trainer that was a bird...but hey by saying that you got alot of views..that was your motive right? ;) 

idiots...

@TheFizzGirls I&#39;m not sure anything I said could possibly pass for ignorance. On the contrary, I was using common knowledge and fact to point out your ignorance. And it thoroughly amuses me to see you get so irritated and upset by it, too. I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re trying to argue here, you seem pissed that I retaliated to your own ignorant, humdrum statement and, since you don&#39;t have the I.Q to deny it, you just sorta&#39; idle. Btw, i&#39;m expecting a &quot;your momma&quot; joke as your next response :D

Hey come see my Videos on my channel for hunting target practice and more!! =)

@TheFizzGirls I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t able to find leg for you to stand on via my google search.

umm...yea. this is a video of a pelican. not the trainer. 



@TheFizzGirls It was no mistake. Killer Whales are the deadliest and most violent creature in the ocean, including great white sharks. They&#39;re cannibalstic, they&#39;ve got a vicious mean streak, AND they&#39;re highly intelligent. They know when they&#39;re beat, and they know when they&#39;re not.

I&#39;m not saying what the whale did was wrong, I was cheering on the beast the whole time! I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t fool yourself.

And by the way, Killer whales arn&#39;t whales. They&#39;re actually dolphins. Look it up.

The whale killed a bird not some trainer in this video....

@123infomaniac omg so true id feel the same way!

@Rarogne1926 So true! 

can i have 1 mintute and 30 seconds of my life back???

Lol the upload date is feb 4 2010, and the thing says the artist is micheal jackson, and that hes playing aug 11, 2011, but he died 4 months after the video uploaded :X R.I.P. Michael

fake video , Michael Jackson !!&lt;3 R.I.P

Where is the death? ass!

In my opinion, the killer whale attacked the trainers at Sea World was because of where they were trained. It may seem like a huge tank to us, but it&#39;s a dungeon for these whales. They should be swimming freely in the oceans and not being trained here.:O

I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!

wow southpark does have some real things in it... it probably just wants to go back to the moon

@OnversePlayer its not even human remaains its bird remains from a pelican shamu killed in the show beforehand

@Sharkoes I would be pretty unhappy to be in a little fish bowl with that size...if they build them a big and i mean BIG lake...yeah, but thats a fishbowl with no natural things inside....not fair.

i agree with letting them go but ask yourself do they look sad? tricks for food that they would have to work harder for in the wild sounds like a fair trade to me many of these whales would probably die out of captivity being that most are probably born there 

LET THEM CREATURES GO, lord, one day a creature will catch trainers and turn em into slaves just because of that. And, no one was seen killed in the video, what is the point of even making it if there&#39;s not going to be shown of what is said. &gt;_&lt;

trollin......

 good one Mr.nodartribute. bravo.

lmfaoo wtf &gt;:l 

whereess da killer whale !

Trollin

 WTF is is this shit!

@flipultarhd iwas i bet a great white shark came after that video

wow that was rlly stupid all i saw was a guy swim back and forth i mean wtf was that?



wth??? all i saw was a trainer swim back and forth and a freakin dead pelican.

@flipultarhd To the contrary, both the whales and the people seem to be having a blast.

thanks i read the comments FIRST!

fuck yeah free willy music

@Smilies85 The trainers at Seaworld treat the whales as if they are priceless gems. They protect them, feed them, and love them. If you are too stupid too realize this then just shut up. You shouldn&#39;t be talking about something you know NOTHING about. I was once a Orca trainer myself and the people there would never hurt an animal. And yes there is room to swim, if you think its a Swimming pool with no room to move around you obviously haven&#39;t been to Seaworld at all!!!

@Smilies85 Unless you&#39;ve worked there, are a marine biologist, a trainer, or have any REAL education on the matter other than your tree-hugging &#39;save the whales&#39; act, you need to back off and not talk about things you don&#39;t understand. My sister was an orca trainer, and those animals are treated amazingly. For us to understand our world, we need to research. So BACK OFF. 

Shitty swimming pool? Are you stupid? You&#39;ll find yourself a shitty swimming pool at the dollar store. This TANK holds more than about 5 million gallons of salt water. Wow ur really a dumb ass.

lol i thought shampoo was a shark

@flipultarhd thumbs up if you&#39;re a complete psychopath and enjoy watching videos of people dying gruesome deaths.

you suk !
Did they kill Shamu for killing the girl?

@ChelseaJHebert to be conpletely honest, the movie was really boring too. haha ;) I ended up changing the chanel. Then turning off the TV, then I watched youtube for like 30 mins, then I shut off my computer, then I started a new book. It was a nice sunday. So yes it was my fault, however, it does get a little annoying when people put false things on youtube to just get views. but ehhh idc, it&#39;s not like I couldn&#39;t just rewind, the movie just wasn&#39;t good enough, but the book that i read was ;)

@ciciironwill27 Why are you watching YouTube if you&#39;re watching a movie...? Isn&#39;t that kind of your own fault?

ok... ive spent like 2 hours searching the video of the trainer&#39;s death and now i feel awful :( what the hell do i care of how she died! i feel so insensitive and useless i was supposed to be studying for an examination and now i think im going to have nightmares about whales =( ive better find out what to do with my time =( RIP. 

@goldhalo12 what about the time u wasted typing that message, or even thinkin of it? just go with 2 mins of ur life =)

I was watching Aliens 3 on BBC. and bc of this video I just missed some guy getting eaten....Now i&#39;m pissed! 

i have rid shamu before

ROFL I seen this video more then once on tv, it just goes after a pelican that lands. it is funny actually,

flag this shit for SPAM&gt;Misleading text

thats a freakin palicans guts i saw the orginal footage

he disabled the thumbs up/down buttons.

Thumb this up, to thumb the video down.



@rhinolimits21 look person they save these wales if the relase them now they wont survive n another thin the relese whales they relese the 1ns tat accut. have a chance out there so get ur fact stright ok tnkz

this is the vid wen they kill a pelican not a trainer so people dnt watch this after the first 5 sec. i could already c wat it is so tats 4 nothing



@flipultarhd thumbs up if you think this guy is an attention seeking norm trying to get the highest rated comment

DOESNT ANYONE HAV THE ACTUAL VID? I MEAN I WANT 2 SEE THE ACTUAL THING! WHY DIDNT U FILM LONGER?  WASTE OF MY TIME!

This video takes place after a pelican gets killed by an orca, the trainers lead the orca&#39;s into another tank and clean up bits and pieces of the pelican ;-)



I like the song but what&#39;s with watching some bald dude collect bird remains from the pool. Huh????

this guy,   the video,,  is an idiot  woooowooo is awsome wow great is and idiot stupid fuck ... way you fuck a dog  fuck a dog 

@QynceeHotwheels ----good one haha

i just saw the video of the whale killing the bird and when it happens it sounds like the crowd is laughing!

oh hey guys watch out for thaat whale; so dangerous.

what the hell was that crap? 

they are pulling a dead bird out of the pool that the whales killed in the show...

wtf stupid ass wasting our fuckin time!

I hate how if one says the same thing as the top comments.

You can see the big wing she picks up on the deck in the beginning.  This video shows the trainer picking up pieces of a bird.  

@4everNYC21 But there was a trainer that shamu killed right? Or was that another whale? I know he killed a pelican, saw that already

nodar.tribute! now you are1 minute with 32 seconds more idiot..

that was a 1:32 of my lfe



i just wasted 1:32 of my life on a freakin guy swimmin back and forth 

Shamu never killed a trainer. He just killed a pelican. Thats what they were cleaning up.

Would be such a good job



that was a pelican dumb ass

Wait what?

Did i blink and miss something or...? o.e

i like the part at 1:32

worst fuking 1:32 I&#39;ve ever wasted

wow that was totally bs

what a peice of crap video



@crazy4isa shamu? if you liked him so much you would see he is stressed in this environment, i didn&#39;t say he wasn&#39;t nice he has just been driven mad, they try to stop them acting on instinct and predator like and accept commands but you can only supress natural behaviour for so long eventually they will explode, like that tiger that the lion man owns that killed a guy &#39;accidently&#39;, it is stupid whales and dolphins belong in the ocean not in tanks.

yes a whale killed its trainer several time  but no not shamu

@crazy4isa he meant to, it is because he is cooped up cruely in a tank! they should be free.

laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmm


What did i just watch?

@kristaraeanne

i watched this video. shamu kills pelacan during a show.

@snuffy1998 acculy 1 the trainer was a girl and 2 u r right but a trainer did get killed by another whale not shamu this video just shows one of the whales eating its food SO LAY OFF PPLZ!

swimming with killer whales good idea! ;(

This was a video of the whale killing a pelican. That&#39;s just nature.

@severmine Because during one of the &quot;Believe&quot; shows a pelican landed in the water and the whales attack it.  Look it up on youtube. Thats where I saw it.

Why is the lady last in line at 0:25 holding a birds severed wing?

wheres the dislike button for this video?!!?



i guess its alright... i love this song anyway

HEY!!!!! IT&#39;S THE FREE WILLY SONG!!!!!! LOL AND A REALLY GOOD SONG TOO!!!! LOVE HIS VOICE!!!! R.I.P

Why the fuck are you playing the Free willy theme ya freggin fuck

this video is not a trainer getting killed. these are bits and pieces of video spliced together.

i saw the whole one before. The whales killed a pelican that landed on the pool

 FALSE LABLING ON YOUR VIDEO!!!

This shows the left overs of the remains of the pelican that the orcas killed.

Just the wrong title geez people

This wasn&#39;t when he killed the trainer. This was when he killed the pelican. Jeez...

Flag this video for spam, the title is misleading as well as the text, its not what it says it is, thumbs up to let others know

Holy crap guys very much this is bullshit dudes no offence This is i just plan old shit man i mean it the is bullshit

@TheGuyFromHades56 u hate Micheal Jackson and thats his song &gt;_&gt;

It was a pelican that flew in and landed in the pool while they were doing a show. The pelican then got ripped to pieces... That&#39;s not pieces of a human.

this is just a man collecting up pelican bits :\

@PhotoShopChannel I agree with you completely. Its just that ppl worship animals too much. That was my point.

wow you&#39;re stupid, using this just to get more views...

@PhotoShopChannel So the troll speaks english? Well done sir.

@vazqum1 why dot you read the descript.....it was about the trainer who got killed...this was just fun footage

The poster disabled rating so people would not rate it down for the being the spam it is.

@lorenzo3961 if u had a chance to comment then u didnt get out &quot;real quick&quot;



after i heard the music i got off real quick





man that guy was SHREDDED to pieces wow so sad 



DISLIKE U LIAR

yeah,  shamu sure killed that guy



lol we all clicked the video to see someone die and then wonder why the creator pranked us......... LOL..  

nobody died ... o.o
wow someone can&#39;t tell the diff between a albtros gittin eatin by the wails or a human this is the vid when one of the whales killed a albatros that landed in there tank not the trainer. :(

i love the bit when the shamu kills the trainer :D

the only reason people clicked on this is to see somebody die!! XD :DD the only reason u titled it this is to get views!! :(

Ratings have been disabled for this video in an attempt to stop viewers reporting it as having a deceptive and misleading title.

nice way to get hits on your video

thums up if u thaugth u gonna be seeying a bloody crazy vid lol :)

this is a video of shamu killing a bird during ther show...

i spent 1:32 waiting for something  horrible to happen.

just flag that at
This sucks!There is no killing!

i love the song!!! i love michael jackson sooo much ju would not believe but very sad for trainer



This kind of video spoiled Youtube....Stop spoil the Youtube!! 

boooooo u suck theres no killing



the video is actually a pelican that was attacked half way through a show 

wtf 

nobody died
i mean it not like i want thetrainer to die but still

@lam10515 I think it&#39;s pretty hilarious too!

Killer whales dont do well in captivity. Most animals live longer in captivity but they actually live a lot longer in the wild. In captivity their lifespan is nearly quartered.

god this made me wanna punch a baby

i feel sad that nobody died

Yeah I know... it&#39;s sad that Michael Jackson died. R.I.P.

wow.... i wasted a min of my life watching this crap!  Way to go Nodartribute, lying just so you can tell your sucky imaginary  friends that you have a 3 million viewed show...... I&#39;m pretty pissed off right now  &gt;:C

it was verbal abuse

mean ether





GAY didnt show crap

i didnt see any body die i feel very cheated


@LushableLosers Even though he was weird me too

wtf nothing happened

@LushableLosers don&#39;t we all.



ratings been disabled cuz it sucks

What is the trainer taking out the water?

Sick and Lame, way for you to get people to look at your video!

shamu didnt do it
tilicum killed her not shamu

we want to see the real kill quit putting fake videos of shamu not killing anyone!

why isnt anyone dying?

who died

@ilovelpstheyrock well, you cankic yur fee to stay bove surface, but dont start flailing around like a kidwih tourets if one comes near you.

@ilovelpstheyrock the best thing you can do around a shark is be completely still.

fuck you douche. thanks for the incredible time waste

um the whale killed a pelican not a person i was there duhhh 

RIP TRAINOR

@SilverCreature1190 well sharks do have big pointy sharp able to rip/shred a human teeth dont they? but hey i wouldnt swim with the sharks for fear of getting too close to those big pointy sharp teeth

@pkleader1123 



I think when people say that, they say it because they mean the shark doesn&#39;t target humans specifically, like you said, they eat what&#39;s in the water and moves

Sharks do intentionally attack people. Sharks don&#39;t attack people out of defense however, a shark attacks a human when it is hunting for food. Sharks do not care if you&#39;re human. They don&#39;t know who you are or care if you have a family. You look like food. Sharks have a very open diet. If it&#39;s in the water and it moves, sharks will eat it. So by saying sharks dont intentionally attack humans, yes, in fact they do intentionally attack humans. When they are hunting for food.

Why would you lie on the title of your video?

Okay I agree,  I miss M J as well

I don&#39;t think there is a video of her being killed!? Why would there be.. I mean if there is a &quot;video&quot; What!? The guy who did just watch her being killed... Unlesss it was at a show while people where video&#39;ing.

@Makipazia :)
@sadlvl3 I totally agree

@getasimbe yeah dude but orcas are sea animals and they are so fuking killers, thats what they do.. or u want to call the police every time a fish kills an other fish?  its aur foult if we dont respect their fredomm!!!!  

@sadlvl3 they are animals. what is wrong with you. when humans kill humans what do we do with them? do they not receive immediate public condemnation? so because they are animals it&#39;s perfectly fine? that logic is so twisted that i&#39;m actually worried for your mental safety. No one deserves to be murdered, and no murder is excusable.

Lol I know it isn&#39;t a dolphin but couldn&#39;t help but think &quot;Good bye and thanks for all the fish&quot; lmao

cmon ppl wuts wrong with u?????   open u damn eyes and see the truth!!!!!!  one orcakills a human and every body is bitching about it, we kill thousands of animals a day and no ones care!!!!! once in a wile they need revenge too!!!!!!! 

fuck you

That stupid fucker owes me!! nodartribute give me 1:32 back and all of your viewers BITCH!!!!

wth was this???!!!!



wow well this was a wast of time thumbs up if you agree

wth is this!! &gt;:(

This is part of the video where a pelican landed on the water during a show and the whales played with it until is was torn to pieces. The whales were put away and a trainer swam out to remove the bird&#39;s parts. 

I miss Micheal Jackson.

Look at the aggressive behaviour of the trainer in the middle 0:08 thru 0:13





WOW IT SAID IT KILLED A TRAINER, NO THE TRAINER WAS BEING GAY AND HOpPING IN THE WATER

False and homosexual

@DrDare1000 hahaha I guess your right about that! I do enjoy Micheal Jackson classics from time to time!!

You are a fuck head

No life looser!
@mvdiablo at least u heard a Michael jackson song

bullshit
just a pelican, boring.
&gt;:(

&gt;:(

Behehehe, free willy. :D

LIAR!  this is sooo lame.  You Suck

It is worldwide known that youtube is not allowed to expose such dramatic and shocking images( real deaths filmed live) even if they were uploaded by some sick member. Still, I read the comments before playing starnged titled videos, just to avoid wasting time watching what I do not want to watch, ja,ja,ja,ja,jaaaaa!!!!! Got you...

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

YOU

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

Dolphins are intelligent and social creatures that, in the wild, interact with hundreds of pod-mates, hunt communally, and have entire coastlines as their playground. In captivity, all of this is lost. Social partners are restricted to a handful of tank-mates. Captive dolphins are fed dead fish (wild dolphins only catch and eat live fish; they never eat dead fish) and they face a profound reduction in space and stimulation. SOURCE WSPA



@Freindly1000 Will you be there by Michael Jackson

wdf i just wasted 1:32 watching this bo crap

what song

@babyari58 They can&#39;t be set free, they would die, they are domestic because of all the breeding that they have done. it would be nice if they were free but they just can&#39;t

liar!!
People who watched this are not morbid or sick. The interest in this is just a fascination with animals and their aggressive nature.  Don&#39;t put videos on with no content. Live and let live.  

thumbs up if you wasted 1:32 seconds of your life watching this.

scanning thru these comments- i see quite a bit of - &quot;gay- this, and faggot- that etc. and &quot;where is the death???&quot; but what about why this happens in first place? Whether it was an &quot;augmented&quot; video about a whale eating a pelican that landed in the pool faked to look like an actual event (so was the pelican)- why aren&#39;t we talking about NOT putting animals and especially MAMMALS in cages?

fuck this vid so boring

wack ass video

fuck off op

its the last footage from the pelican killing vid :Shamu attacks and kills pelican during show

WTF...  just part of the show, a trainer swimming in the pool?

The only thing good about this video is the song

Thumbs up if you think that the &quot;(huge) amateur filmer&#39;s camera&quot; went out of batteries when it happened.

Flagged,sucker!

thumbs up if you came here because you thought it was real human death



@neilandbeatrice


Fuck you! I am so fucking sick of people lying about their YouTube videos. EVERY GOD-DAMNED DAY! Why? Why do you do it? Fuck you sideways, you fucking bitch.

@danny22aces 

my favorite part was 1:33 an on.... thumbs up if you agree

wank
liar video title
FUCK THEM THAT&#39;S WHAT THEY GET FOR FUCKING WITH WILD ANIMALS...NO SYMPATHY!!!!!!!!! TOO BAD!!!
This is of the attack on the pelican, although I think you did this deliberately just to get people to watch it.

om gosh i fell for it
all of the rest of us have lifes you know we dont want to watch this stupid video and this is some cheesey music

ZOMG!!! I can&#39;t believe how much BLOOD there was ... that was so gross!!!

the wahel killed a bird.......not a trainer

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

not what title says...  

Whatever!!!

I loath people who waste my fucking time with their shit videos with bullshit video titles...need attention much?

@teamangels9 it was a pelican! LIER!

@Kurasutaru THEY DO NOT PROMOTE TO KILL THEM WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT????
@megamoneybags THEY DO NOT PROMOTE TO KILL THEM WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT????

@StARbriteexx actually, its a mammal, look it up on google ;)

@megamoneybags well, they save them, they don&#39;t advertise that they protect them, but they do and if it is on the discovery channel, sea world is partnered with animal planet and discovery sao why would thye promote to kill them, read about sea world before you post a comment

@Kurasutaru Seaworld does not promote that, they protect the dolphins

i wished shamu ate all those morons in swimm suits

lier

the only reason you got so many views is coz you said the trainer get&#39;s killed you knob

I was expecting a Rick&#39;roll....

Seaworld protects endangered species of animals, takes care of them, and protects them during natural disasters, why don&#39;t you all pick up a paper and read how Seaworld protects the ocean and its creatures beforde you trash it

sea world doesn&#39;t only keep animals in exhibits, they have them there for studies and they actually like it there. Seaworld has programs that rescue and take care of animals and injured ones, who do you think took care of the animals during the oil spills????

@smooshycakes i agree. it should be called &quot;animals-that-hate-people-and-should-be-left-in-the-wild  world&quot; not sea world. same thing with the zoos.

@StARbriteexx  OK. first of all, im not even close to stupid. your probably the uneducated person sitting in school texting all day, goes home, gets on my space, then sneaks out and smokes pot at night! not me. thanks, but no thanks, i like my brain cells. and second, your the one that&#39;s uneducated, because you didn&#39;t even spell &quot;uneducated&quot; right. and third, there have been several Shamus&#39;s, not just one. they has been around 20, and they all died. probably from torture and lack of space.

well, you kind of have a point. actually, earth will probably be hit by a comet, or after the sun gets like seriously old it starts to expand, then after expanding it will crash into the earth, burning it. then, it will explode and cause a super nova. i think thats right... :P oh well. but yes, studies show that humans will not exist anymore when the world ends.

SEAworld. you see that word SEA?! yeah, thats why it should be in the SEA

@smooshycakes someone just watched the cove lol

shit vid. tuneeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tho

um you should change ur video title, it does not go with the video. thanks for wasting 1:32 min of my precious life

@erisinger Um, I doubt humans will ever go extinct. People are being born everyday. I think if we were ever to be extinct, Earth would have to blow up or some disease just wipes us all out.

@StARbriteexx  you should ashamed of yurself you inconsiderate little brat! its people like u, the people at sea world, and all those black markets that are killing the planet!!! not pollution, and not unrecycaling! if it werent for humans, the damn whales wouldnt be killing people, and the planet wouldnt be polluted! its humans fault for detroying the earth, and for the murder of others!! and it may be morbid of me to say that, but its true! the human society will go extinct before u know it!!!

I think they should just let them go bsc into the wild its wrong to keep them there workin 24/7 its not there fault thats the wat they r ppl should just leave them alone

@7CollegeKid I know!! I hate when people have misleading titles.

gay



change the title dude, its not what the video about



This isn&#39;t from when they killed a trainer, the whales killed a pelican.  There&#39;s a video on youtube called Shamu Attacks and Kills Pelican during show.

very beginning=nom nom :) i love these animals, but its sad how the trainers get killed by them. AINT IT OBIVOUS THEY WANNA BE FREE?!

Omg are you serious the whale killed a Pelican I knew that right when i started watching it because i&#39;ve seen footage of them killing the pelican its pretty awesome

EPIC SONG! 

That was a bird not the trainer

ass -.-

LIARS GO HOME NOBODY LIKES YOU

what Peanut and 619stranger said

yea what he said FUCK YOU!!!!

@JerkersCBintl  Really, what is wrong with you?

actually theyd go all fucked up in the wild cause they were all born in captivity you gorm

flag as spam, misleading video!
actually tht whale wanna free dom

biggest crap on youtube

@staphinfection Man, your post makes me want to butcher a couple of rhinos. 

FUCK YOU JACKASS

lol free willy

This is the bird attack.  Fuck sea world though.  And fuck putting animals into captivity so we can charge people to view them....  Way to exploit nature....



Stop going to fucking zoos, and sea worlds, and just WATCH nature shows.  Start with Planet Earth, it&#39;s amazing and way more in your face then a stupid zoo.

Lol, look at all the angry commenters who didn&#39;t get their fix of death and mayhem.

except its really a stolen video of when they killed a wild PELICAN! No more than a video of a dog getting ahold of a rabbit, or a mouse. Its what they are designed to do! yes they are smart, yes they do tricks, and yes they eat meat!  Just natures way. I have no idea why its labled so cruel. 

@systemaddictshock Me Too actually cause i&#39;d actually make an attempt to laugh

its a pelican

fuck u



Shamu killed a Pelican stupid ass!

aww what a dick

lol guyz u r the one who are misleading yoursleves why the fuck would u watch someone dying?

to please your self? 

i didn&#39;t realize how sick this world is till now 

rofl...that pelican got pwned

fuck you

it&#39;s too bad that you can&#39;t give this video thumbs up or thumbs down, it&#39;s just fun to see a video which has only got thumbs down...

i stopped the video and read the comments first :D

THUMBS DOWN... even though ratings disabled.

your a dick
Sad bastard
waste of data and bandwith

gay

what a rip off video...and a waste of youtubes time

@jasmine123A Ok, I agree with you that it is annoying that he lied but seriously... crap on his grave? Rip his limbs off? That is SOO uncalled for!

Wow 1:32 of my life I&#39;ll never get back you fucking douche...........



this is soooo dumb

dude, ur a fucktard!!!

oh this is the incident where the pelican was killed. PELICAN. NOT TRAINER. i mean i realize they both have 2 feet but seriously...

Well... &#39;least the music was nice?

that was a total waste of my time.  This should be taken off YOUTUBE.

@beatrixbelle i agree exactly he just got all them views and subscibers for that crap, worthless i didn&#39;t even see a shamu HURT OR HARM  a single person or thing! if u aks me, it&#39;s stupid. i been looking for a rela one showing the shsmu killing the trainer never found one. how stupid.

it didn,t kill the trainer! DUMBASS!

yea you suck
@beatrixbelle Eh, he&#39;s partially correct, only it wasn&#39;t the trainer that got attacked. From the looks of it, this is the last few minutes of the video an audience member shot of the four killer whales attacking and killing a pelican that landed on the water in the middle of the show.

yay! more effing spam vids! ^^

what the hell dont give a friggin misleading title, everyone hates you now. welcome to the 21st century

@dethyl yes. imma fat ass. lol

It&#39;s a fake, Shame ate a pelikan in this video.

If I were a killer whale I&#39;d attack too if I had to hear this child molesters song one more time. 

fuck you for posting this  punk

@xxmidnightravenxx1 Haha you&#39;re a fatass.

I&#39;d rather be Rickrolled than watch this.

wheres the death? i paid good money to watch this

and wth noone died why did you put trainor killed? if nobody died?

u took this vid from another person



thank goodness no one died :D

WEIRD! You DISABLED the ratings for this video! 

this is so fake!

the only reason i am still watching this video is because of good song choice (MJ)

Micheal was genius

fucking garbage.....


hahaha, wasnt this song in free willy?

i could of done alot more things with that tim this sucks u should of atleast changed the tittle shamu show

great song
@lynnandian michael jackson - will you be there

happy ending, looks like no one was injured at all.

@CoolAngelica99 LOL :P good one hahaha

i think youtube should ban you from posting videos. this is by far the worst video ever. why would you post this. nothing happened, i expected to see someone gett killed like ur video said. like the other 2 people said, a big waste of my life here.

@lynnandian michel jackson free willy hahha

what the heack is this song?

who dies?

WE WANT SOME DIED



HOLY TITS....

@MonkeyzRule10112 trust me there are videos up.

some ppl just dont listen to park instructors.

is that why rating is disabled for this vid? cus it&#39;s crap and nobody&#39;s gonna like it?

they probly killed it harpoooned it and just its natureal instinct

thats stuopid



@xxgeordiejulesxx lol

whoever posted this video stole it from the original poster.  This was actually shot a couple years ago.  The whale jumps up out of the water and grabs a pelican and then the whales tear it apart.  You can see the female trainer on the deck carrying half of the bird and walking off stage with it.  The guy trainer then goes into the water to retrieve several pieces of the bird.  The original poster has the proper title on it and it is 10 min. long.  It shows the whale jump up and grab the bird.

@Unpronouncebal  ive removed my 1st comment so others arent tempted to watch it

@Unpronouncebal Have fun with it then. It&#39;s 8½ mins of pain.

@xxgeordiejulesxx lol it cant be that bad

@Unpronouncebal ,to be honest,i would advise you watch some reaction videos to it first if you intend watching it............but  i shouldnt have told you to wach it,for that i am sorry

Michael Jackson!
@xxgeordiejulesxx hmmmm.... mabye lol
@letthebeatrok k~
I WANNA SEE DEATH D:&lt;

@MisoRamensama you are correct :) and this video is still fucking hilarious!

Wow the whale really killed him, what the hell is this shit.

This video was ripped off of Normkangaroo&#39;s, if I am correct. 

omg hey moron how the crap is that a trainer? wow ur stupid change title and that music sucks

WOW! I&#39;M STUNNED!!!! THAT WAS SHOCKING!!! 

   FUCK YOU, WHOEVER JUST WASTED MY TIME!!!

Awful music had to quit early

this will never happened if they wouldnt hunt this wales idiots 

but nothing happened...

what is that thing that he puts in a bucket???

sea world dont screw with us

what is song name?

I was at that show when I was on vacation, it was absolutely traumatizing...people were screaming, there was so much chaos and confusion - why would anyone want to see someone drown in such a violent way? There was such an uncomfortable silence that could be felt throughout the park, security guarding Shamu Stadium, news choppers hovering over the area, camera crews posted outside of the entrance even after they reopened the show the following weekend. My condolences go out to Dawn&#39;s family. 

i can see that is some one is killed get a life plz ! 

fuck whoever made this video

gay music

interesting music choice for a video about &quot;someone getting killed&quot; you poop eater

@ashthegreat Exactly, glad we can agree on that :)

This is only a part of &quot;Shamu attacks and kills Pelican during show&quot; by normkangaroo. 

nothin happed dont watch this cause noby died they just want alot of views.



I think hes loking for the trainer that died



this was from when they killed a pelecan during the show

this is one song i actually liked by MJ

yawn



fucking waste of time

@liveforepicness ..then y r u here?

@ashthegreat well your the dumbass that was searched for this video, he must have wanted to see someone die..

Lol page 108

@babychika1230 No you aren&#39;t friend sorry

@yellowsub134  your comment was okay until you accused the person of being a &quot;fag&quot;.  Quite extrodinary to use such a word to lend itself in a way as to insult a person, when you are talking passionately about soldiers and wars which usually relate to fighting for freedoms and peace for all people to live amongst one another in a humane way.  I don&#39;t care what the person wrote that so upset you, you just blew yourself out of the water. (pardon the pun)

@ItisDoom  seams that your time is so valuavle. jajaja

this vid sucks

@ashthegreat i totally agree!

we want dead people we want dead people !!
@ashthegreat  JOIN THE IRAK WAR???

@ItisDoom   This is peppermintyy and omg I know right WASTE OF MY FRICK&#39;N TIME!!!!!!!! DONT OUT SHIT ON LIKE THIS!!

gay

wow nobody died waste of time I wasted a 1:35 out of my lifr

Killer whales are awesome animals to see, on pictures and videos. But they are not animals to use for shows and all that shit. 

Why advertise something that doesnt hapen? whats the point?

@ashthegreat dude you&#39;re missing the point, it&#39;s not that i want to see someone die. but i was looking for a video of the killer whale attacking the trainer, and this isn&#39;t it. it&#39;s false advertising.

Fuk I don&#39;t beleive it. another fake title video clip!

This is a video of the aftermath of a killer whale eating a pelican! The trainers are getting the pelicans body parts out of the water!

the guy dident even get killed
Why would you want to see someone be killed bye a whale?

but still I don&#39;t like fake videos.

you are a stinking liar! 

@NolaSaint17 u cant put tat online bt ters a video seconds before she gets draged in its called Tourist&#39;s Camera Rolls Seconds Before Whale Attack its on the side n its 6:57 long

This is so cute. I love watching people work with animals and no one gets hurt. People shouldn&#39;t be angry that they didn&#39;t see someone get hurt. That&#39;s just sick.

@ashthegreat    well said.. I&#39;m just glad there are still some people like you 

this is stupid-and micheal jackson was a child molesting freak.

the only dead thing in this video are the fish 

Only at Seaworld.

wowowow false advertisement buddy



zoos are so cruel :(

@italianmale6008 haha good one lol

You&#39;ve stolen my original footage that I posted on youtube a couple of years ago and quite sickly added inapropriate text to the part you have used. Every part of your video is false and I have reported you to youtube.

go to fucking hell you dipshit i hate you don&#39;t put any more videos on youtube. please leave public spaces alone.

will you be there

The real joke is how much money this guy has made off over 2million views... so comment all you want hating on him he doesn&#39;t care.

god fucking damn it!!!!!  This is not where the bitch dies.  I wanted to see the video of the lady getting killed.  Instead I&#39;ve had my time wasted.

Real classy move! Your family must be proud...

wow that waz a biggggg wast if time!!!!!!!!

wow F*** you man waste my time with this sh**

free the damn whales...

thats not the whale killing a trainer thats film footage of them trainers cleaning up the remains of a pelican after the whales attacked it when it landed on the water. the park wasn&#39;t evacuated

the only one dead in this video is mj haha

it just so happens that this video was posted the day a person was REALLY killed by a 

killer whale. why even waste ur life putting this video on youtube. because clearly a bird is not A FUCKING PERSON!

um.......the killer whale only killed the bird........and its just showing its remains.....

@mymajorpain1 i always do
your mother's pussy
Shamu is nice he would never hurt anyone, I even petted him SeaWorld when I was like 6 or 7.

Guys youtube will not allow ppl to post a violent graphic video where someone dies in it.  To see videos like that you would have to go to wwwDOTogrishDOTcom but that site has been closed down and a similar site remade but it has less graphic videos in it now called wwwDOTliveleakDOTcom

fuck this noise

@ChemicalRespirator wtf?

pelican and the herons were there because of the fish leftovers.  

It looks like it wanted to play, unfortianantly the pelican was easialy cut in to pieces.

Killer whales are so cute =3
