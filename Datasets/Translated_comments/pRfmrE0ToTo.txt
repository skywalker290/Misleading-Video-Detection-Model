COME HERE BECAUSE OF KYUNGSOO!🐧🖤
You know I want you

It&#39;s not a secret I try to hide

You know you want me

So don&#39;t keep saying our hands are tied

You claim it&#39;s not in the cards

And fate is pulling you miles away

And out of a reach from me

But you&#39;re hearing my heart

So who can stop me if I decide it&#39;s on my destiny?



What if we rewrite the stars?

Say you were made to be mine

Nothing could keep us apart

You&#39;ll be the one I was meant to find

It&#39;s up to you, and it&#39;s up to me

No one could say what we get to be

So why don&#39;t we rewrite the stars?

And maybe the world could be ours, tonight



You think it&#39;s easy

You think I don&#39;t wanna run to you, yeah

But there are mountains (But there are mountains)

And there are doors that we can&#39;t walk through

I know you&#39;re wondering why

Because we&#39;re able to be just you and me within these walls

But when we go outside

You&#39;re gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all



No one can rewrite the stars

How can you say you&#39;ll be mine?

Everything keeps us apart

And I&#39;m not the one you were meant to find

It&#39;s not up to you, it&#39;s not up to me, yeah

When everyone tells us what we can be

And how can we rewrite the stars?

Say that the world can be ours, tonight



All I want is to fly with you

All I want is to fall with you

So just give me all of you

It feels impossible (It&#39;s not impossible)

Is it impossible?

Say that it&#39;s possible



And how do we rewrite the stars?

Say you were made to be mine

And nothing can keep us apart

&#39;Cause you are the one I was meant to find

It&#39;s up to you, and it&#39;s up to me

No one could say what we get to be

And why don&#39;t we rewrite the stars?

Changing the world to be ours



You know I want you

It&#39;s not a secret I try to hide

But I can&#39;t have you

We&#39;re bound to break and my hands are tied

I’m here to listen because I just broke up with my gf those who has been with me for 10 years, this song heals my soul and gave me a little hope for taking her back

Hiii, i from the future 2024❤

HOW IS THIS NOT THE OG VERSION?!

Hi I&#39;m from the future

p

This song reminds me of &quot;You&#39; ve reached sam&quot; book❤

This year, this timeless song will be 6 years old 🎉

Love

You know I want youIt&#39;s not a secret I try to hideYou know you want meSo don&#39;t keep saying our hands are tiedYou claim it&#39;s not in the cardsAnd fate is pulling you miles awayAnd out of a reach from meBut you&#39;re hearing my heartSo who can stop me if I decide it&#39;s on my destiny?What if we rewrite the stars?

How do you make all of these chorus songs? It's great that you can cut a male version, a female version and both, what TikTok needs, the market is great.

You know I want youIt&#39;s not a secret I try to hideI know you want meSo don&#39;t keep sayin&#39; our hands are tiedYou claim it&#39;s not in the cardsAnd fate is pullin&#39; you miles awayAnd out of reach from meBut you&#39;re here in my heartSo who can stop me if I decideThat you&#39;re my destiny?What if we rewrite the stars?Say you were made to be mineNothing could keep us apartYou&#39;d be the one I was meant to findIt&#39;s up to you, and it&#39;s up to meNo one can say what we get to beSo why don&#39;t we rewrite the stars?Maybe the world could be oursTonightYou think it&#39;s easyYou think I don&#39;t wanna run to youBut there are mountainsAnd there are doors that we can&#39;t walk throughI know you&#39;re wondering why because we&#39;re able to beJust you and me within these wallsBut when we go outside, you&#39;re gonna wake up and seeThat it was hopeless after allNo one can rewrite the starsHow can you say you&#39;ll be mine?Everything keeps us apartAnd I&#39;m not the one you were meant to findIt&#39;s not up to youIt&#39;s not up to meWhen everyone tells us what we can beHow can we rewrite the stars?Say that the world can be oursTonightAll I want is to fly with youAll I want is to fall with youSo just give me all of youIt feels impossibleIt&#39;s not impossibleIs it impossible?Say that it&#39;s possibleHow do we rewrite the stars?Say you were made to be mine?Nothing can keep us apart&#39;Cause you are the one I was meant to findIt&#39;s up to youAnd it&#39;s up to meNo one can say what we get to beAnd why don&#39;t we rewrite the stars?Changing the world to be oursYou know I want youIt&#39;s not a secret I try to hideBut I can&#39;t have youWe&#39;re bound to break and my hands are tied

How many boys have i dedicated this song to. I feel that the problem is in me I&#39;m so scared of being in love and i missed a great man because of that i still miss him and remember him from time to time

When he was still able to open his mouth while singing 😊…

I just did an electric guitar version of this… thanks for the inspiration!

I have to move on now and I&#39;m not the man she wants now I&#39;m done I love her so much she knows I want her hand and support in my bad days so I supported her in her bad days but she already had a boyfriend in abroad and I Am here I have just started studying for a better future and she is also going progress abroad she never said this and it makes me so empty she already had a boyfriend but she always acted like I was the only one for her and made me like that but she knows I love her and I know she loves me too but she chose the future i&#39;ve waiting for her she said waiting me and I&#39;ll wait but                                              You know I want youIt&#39;s not a secret I try to hideI know you want me but.......

I have a crush on my girl best friend and she likes my cousin (i know because she tells me whenever she gets a new crush) and we met each other back in daycare and our parents know each other pretty well. Every once and a while they come to our house and we go do random stuff like go outside and just go to our other classmates. And there was also this one time we were in a car ride coming back home from a road trip and it was midnight already so we were already sleepy and when i woke up i was sleeping on her shoulders. This song just really reminds me of her and i just wish made to be mine :)

I love this song🫶🇵🇭💙the stars are falling with🫰

This song is still amazing!! The way James said/sang Destiny just sounds different but amazing at the same time!! The way Anne just sings is incredible!! You two need to do more songs together you both sound so amazing together.

Everyone can listen but only a few who can relate can understand the song

2024 who&#39;s with me?❤

2024 👍🏻 anyone 🎧🍃
Perfect 🤧💗
I like it
The best❤❤❤❤
This version and Zac and Zendaya's are both incredible!
I prefer this slightly slower paced, lower key version.I found the official Zac/Zendaya video to be visually distracting.  I know the voices had to be redubbed over the footage, but while watching the video, I kept thinking...how could they be that physical and singing at the same time. 😂

Love this song everyday I’m vibing to itttttt

THIS IS MASTERPIECE🙌👏
This guy is good but replacing Zach effron and zendaya is unspeakable

Wow ❤❤❤❤
The song is chassis

You know I want youIt&#39;s not a secret I try to hideYou know you want meSo don&#39;t keep saying our hands are tiedYou claim it&#39;s not in the cardsAnd fate is pulling you miles awayAnd out of a reach from meBut you&#39;re hearing my heartSo who can stop me if I decide it&#39;s on my destiny?What if we rewrite the stars?Say you were made to be mineNothing could keep us apartYou&#39;ll be the one I was meant to findIt&#39;s up to you, and it&#39;s up to meNo one could say what we get to beSo why don&#39;t we rewrite the stars?And maybe the world could be ours, tonightYou think it&#39;s easyYou think I don&#39;t wanna run to you, yeahBut there are mountains (But there are mountains)And there are doors that we can&#39;t walk throughI know you&#39;re wondering whyBecause we&#39;re able to be just you and me within these wallsBut when we go outsideYou&#39;re gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

5 years later, loving this little gem &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The thought of the lyrics is great plus the singers&#39; voices are amazing, but the concept of the MV is not suited.

It&#39;s been a year i always play this music , the reason is she left me 😢

Who is here in 2024 🥹♥️

I'm Indonesian myself
I fell in love with this one. Reminds me of the purest love I had to let go of. We were worlds apart. I felt I couldn&#39;t be everything I was supposed to be for him so I let go and let it to continue to kill me slowly.. I keep hoping though, that some day in future..maybe, just maybe, we&#39;ll find each other again and if that never happens, I will keep that part of my heart that I gave him forever. Until next time my forever love

Lmao this song hurts me physically

I couldn't get past it then
This song goes really well with the book under the same star
Who else is hearing this masterpiece in 2024😂😂

who here is listening in 2024?

still good to hear in 2024

The meaning is beautifully perfect, it could be a beautiful friendly relationship or maybe a beautiful romance story, it is very deep, it makes me want to fight for a love as magical as this song wants to describe it and feel it on a starry night. Ok, the You by Anne Marie and James Arthur are so sublime that they fill all my senses.
