This is remake of malayalam movie Ramji rao speaking... Here Paresh rawal doing the role of malayalam actor name Innocent.  As a keralite I can surely say that Paresh has done 101% justice to the role and even excelled Innocent in certain portions especially in dialogues and slang

Too good man!! Babu Bhaiya is the other name of Comedy..😁😂😂😂💕

Babu bhaiya op ???
This was Diamond of that time and still shining 💎💎Once in a decade these type of movies come.

That was the time...there was no instagram.. Facebook, Internet were not so widespreaded, No fake smile, fake sympathy. For films we had the option of Cinema halls and TV.. And moreover some great artists like Paresh Rawal, Johnny Lever, Rajpal Yadav, Vijay Raj, Sanjay Mishra always showed their talent, acting skills..not like today&#39;s so called actors. Phir Hera pheri, golmaal: Fun unlimited, Dhamaal, Golmaal, Dhol; these are some evergreen cinemas. We can notice the actual struggle of actors, not so called struggle. A huge difference is visible between bollywood of that time and today. These above-mentioned films will never get old.But what is the reality we have to accept that, time flies...everything changes.. but that was the golden era... Most important nostalgia for every 90&#39;s kid.

There is only competition for babu rao and he is none other than our modi.

Jkoohnjo
It&#39;s not movie it&#39;s an emotion 😅

There was no door inside before, there was no door either.
