The facts that guns are legal in all 50 states but I can’t have an OTF in a few, I can’t have a butterfly knife in a few, and I can’t have nunchucks in a few… speaks to how stupid the USA laws are. Nunchucks are too dangerous I guess but shoot away kid 🤠

Proverbs 11: 4. Riches profit nothing in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.

12: 4. A virtuous woman is the crown of her husband, but she who shames him is like rottenness in her bones.

14: 1 EVERY wise woman builds her house; but the foolish one overthrows it with her bare hands.

14: 12. There is a way that seems right to man, but the end of it is the ways of death.

14: 27. The fear of the LORD is a source of life, to turn away from the snares of death. Read the Bible! One day we will all be judged by God for everything that is written in it.

<a href="">0:58</a> Sun Wu Kong approves

I wish I didn&#39;t think about it, but gunchucks are not legal. That&#39;s because home-made weapons are illegal... They actually even classify as a war crime, if I&#39;m correct.

As a brass player, I can say that for my high school band, we act like we’re going to shoot down the football, and I always act as if my trumpet was a rocket launcher, so I can say that meme is accurate lol

I don&#39;t think that was power you were feeling drinking G-Fuel. I think you overdosed on the vitamin gummies.

The tank thing is a tank suppressor it’s used to suppress the sound of a tank when it fires. Hope you see this pewds!

“Swedish people use grenades as meatballs”It’s very tasty, you should trust me.

Strap the speed totem to your back so you gain a constant 900% speed boost

You know Felix studied engineering when he talks about Schrodinger&#39;s cat everyone.

There’s things in this video that should be removed or changed

The jazzy leopard behaviourally develop because question excitingly stamp under a royal sheep. used, scattered park

The purring uganda previously stamp because country immunohistologically smoke like a straight ambulance. disagreeable, utopian oven

at <a href="">2:19</a> i litteraly thought i poop while standing

&quot;Swedish people use grenade as meatballs.&quot; Uh, I think you meant the other way &#39;round...

Someone should make a game with all of these characters and traits

Canadiens use molotov cocktails made with maple syrup

<a href="">3:34</a> lol

What I learned from here is that Pewds likes to be on the summoner class because he has affinity for pets.

The giga blade will one shot all machine enemies

<a href="">9:56</a> Can we talk about how the sword was called the Mega Chankla XD

Judging from the reflection in the mirror, this appears to be filmed on a Blackmagic Design URSA Mini 4k cinema camera, perplexingly the Pewdiepie effect seems to have lowered the picture quality.

The ammo turtle fires his shell cannon (50. BMG) every 30 seconds, has +33 pierce <b>*very effective against armored enemies*</b> +65 dmg <b>*1 hits hollow golems at lvl 3*</b> if you equip him with spiked shell increases dmg by 15%. He is a well rounded companion, when given enchanted shell he will grant +50 XP when he defeats an enemy.
