A super cute movie! As expected of Ayushman! I have been supporting Lgbtq+ community for a year now and the comment box makes me feel so proud of India. We are a liberal country and NO ONE must be judged or prohibited for the simple and gorgeous art of loving.

Jeetu ❤️❤️
Science k language v use kr rh h 🤘
Gave a bio to the father
Can we get a prequel or sequel plss. Anything with these two as a couple. They&#39;ve such an amazing chemistry😻

Mujhe nehi pata tha ki pyaar mei itna Science hai...😂😂ab toh Science ke darr se pyaar kabhi na karu mei😂😂

I really hope to see more LGBT+ movies amd content in India so that people can finally be themselves and not keep on second guessing their lives the whole time.Love is love ,we dont need to put it in a cage of stereotypes.

So I just completed this movie (ik I&#39;m late) and let me just say these two were so effing CUTE! Like my heart just melted🥺 their chemistry was everything! The story was really good as well!! Entertaining n so wholesome❤️ (kinda wished they had more kisses tho lol I&#39;m such a sucker for kisses😁)

Aman&#39;s eyeroll will always be iconic 👍👍

This is such a great scene,great acting, amazing dialogues. Love Aman and Karthik ❤️ I watched this movie today as a birthday gift to me because I absolutely love BLs and a Hindi BL movie should never be missed. &#39;aapki oxytocin pyar aur mere oxytocin bimari?&#39; I cried in this scene

Jeetu bhaiya op
Am I the only one who hasn&#39;t watch this yet😱

Amazon Prime Video finally remembering that they were supposed to promote SMZS and not release it suddenly without creating any hype. I mean come on people, the movie, Bhoot got more promotion. And SMZS was dropped at <a href="">12:00</a> without any notice. Good to see that they&#39;re bringing attention to the movies and making sure it gets the audience it deserves

Ayushmaan sir and jitu bhaiya rock the floor 👏👏👏🔥🔥😍the way jitu sir explain about the love really to good👍 🔥🔥😍😍💞
