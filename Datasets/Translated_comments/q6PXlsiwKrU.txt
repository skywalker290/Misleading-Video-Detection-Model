A super cute movie! As expected of Ayushman! I have been supporting Lgbtq+ community for a year now and the comment box makes me feel so proud of India. We are a liberal country and NO ONE must be judged or prohibited for the simple and gorgeous art of loving.

Hey brother, what do you want to say?
Istg I love both of them

That background music <a href="">1:54</a> -<a href="">2:08</a> and <a href="">3:28</a>-<a href="">3:47</a> made this scene more emotional ..loved this movie and that music too..Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

Jitu bhaiya‚Ä¶.
Everyone has different opinions, I am against this

Who bottoms tho-

Mujhe nehi pata tha ki pyaar mei itna Science hai...ab toh Science ke darr se pyaar kabhi na karu mei

Nicely done

Both look amazing
Movie name
I really hope to see more LGBT+ movies amd content in India so that people can finally be themselves and not keep on second guessing their lives the whole time.Love is love ,we dont need to put it in a cage of stereotypes.

Where can I watch this full movie now?

Did anyone here watch young royals ?

<a href="">1:37</a> hahahahahahahahaha

I badly  want a part 2 of this film 
I can watch it 10 times without getting bored .

So I just completed this movie (ik I&#39;m late) and let me just say these two were so effing CUTE! Like my heart just melted their chemistry was everything! The story was really good as well!! Entertaining n so wholesomeÔ∏è (kinda wished they had more kisses tho lol I&#39;m such a sucker for kisses)

Aman&#39;s eyeroll will always be iconic 

Jeetu&#39;s annoyed eyeroll when mrs. Neena did not understand the meaning of domobind(sorry if i spell it wrong)

The story of the movie was absolutely useless... How much a legendary movie could it have been... But this story writer did it to the fullest
Lovely movie

Tru love never tie in any boundry

This is such a great scene,great acting, amazing dialogues. Love Aman and Karthik Ô∏è I watched this movie today as a birthday gift to me because I absolutely love BLs and a Hindi BL movie should never be missed. &#39;aapki oxytocin pyar aur mere oxytocin bimari?&#39; I cried in this scene

Now I thought about science...why do I love science?

Over 10 months and still obsessed with these two! No couple deserves a prequel more than them 

I hope we get a prequel on how Kartik and Aman fell in love or a sequel 

Jeetu is such a great actor! <a href="">1:58</a> This scene always gives me goosebumps and brings tears in my eyes, the dialogues, his act, everything was just perfect. This is one of my favourite scenes! And the entire movie is just beautiful.Ô∏è

this movie is beautiful it&#39;s just beautiful, the way they showed their love and the message they wanted to send to the world is just mind blowing 

I can never get enough of them, <a href="">#jitushmann</a>

Jeetu bhaiya op
Am I the only one who hasn&#39;t watch this yet

Amazon Prime Video finally remembering that they were supposed to promote SMZS and not release it suddenly without creating any hype. I mean come on people, the movie, Bhoot got more promotion. And SMZS was dropped at <a href="">12:00</a> without any notice. Good to see that they&#39;re bringing attention to the movies and making sure it gets the audience it deserves

Ayushmaan sir and jitu bhaiya rock the floor the way jitu sir explain about the love really to good 
Ayushmann and jeetu SO MUCH TALENT 
Pyaar means love. There is no difference between a girl or a boy. Ayushmann with Jitu's example. I love Ayushmann.  from Bangladesh üáßüá©üáßüá©üáßüá©
