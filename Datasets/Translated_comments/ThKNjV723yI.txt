Total population of India in the year 1983 was 74.94 crores. But it is still around 100 crores.
Nice
We don&#39;t want any actor in any movie who is anti Hindu and Pro Muslim like Ranveer Singh if any movie has a any actor who is anti Hindu and Pro Muslim we completely boycot that movie movie

India will still win, India will still be written on many World Cups, there is still time left, my friends.
I was just 03 at 83 when India won the World Cup &amp; felt proud when I learnt this proud moment, n i m feeling very much lucky to see the result of second world cup won by india, by Dhoni bhai, hats off to our heroes

Sachin tendulkar par movies banao blockbuster banegi

El Dalit obc film cricket me ni h dhokha kiya jata aya h mare sath
If Kapil Dev (175 not out) would not have stood tall and saved the team against Zimbabwe after 17/5 at Tunbridge Wells, then India would&#39;ve returned home immediately.This World Cup became possible ONLY BECAUSE OF KAPIL DEV&#39;S UNSHAKEABLE TEAM FAITH AND SELF BELIEF THAT TIME.I think Kapil Dev&#39;s 175 not out in SUCH A CRISIS SITUATION is infinitely better than Vivian Richards or even Donald Bradman knock !!! Also, we all clearly forget to appreciate and honor the towering grit and perseverance of our lower order batsmen in this match - It was not Kapil Dev alone but the invaluable priceless partnership contribution by the legends Roger Binny, Madan Lal and Syed Kirmani actually brought India out of the skeleton in the graveyard of 17/5. So, full credit and endless respect to respected lower order batsmen legends Roger Binny, Madan Lal and Syed Kirmani who stood absolutely firm alongside the legend of Kapil Dev.By the way, I have a surprising fact for all the worldly readers.As per cricinfo, the report section (of Kapil Dev 175 against Zimbabwe) states that THERE WAS ONE INDIAN SUPPORTER IN THE CROWD WHO CAPTURED KAPIL INNINGS FROM HIS PLACE IN CROWD AS HE HAD BROUGHT A VIDEO CAMERA.IN FACT HE MADE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THAT VIDEO.READ LAST PARAGRAPH (IN REPORT SECTION OF KAPIL DEV 175 CRICINFO) TO KNOW MORE.

Every week 2 people commit suicide in Nagpur due to unemployment. Jimeddar my mantahu 50% government and 50%Indian directors. Indian directors have never in the last 70 years made movies to address the dreams of India's poor people. The results appear to be clear. Unemployment, unemployment. 0

Are you watching the trailer or chanting Sachin, nonsense 
Love you Sushant ️
Cricket and Bollywood have wasted a lot of people...they waste hours of time and if they had given time to their education and business then perhaps a man would have been more successful than a cricketer or actor.
83 is for Kapil Dev, Sachin k liye nhi

Sachin sirf ek game player h .. but Kapil Dev MSD life player h ..

I was 16 years old when India win this world cup . It was just unbelievable. I enjoyed these 1983 world cup moments by hearing radio commentary . I am just excited to watch Kapil Paji&quot;s innings against Zimbabwe When Kapil Paji hitted 175 , because unfortunately no TV footageis available , as BBC broadcast workers were on strike on that day. I just want to enjoy those golden memories &amp; moments once again. Hats off to Kapil Paji&quot;s team , because his team just murdered English reporters arrogance.  

Was it necessary to lie about the video title? At least you should have thought of Sachin Tendulkar.
In 1983 total population almost 75 Cr not 100cr

Superb year ever in independent India history ever. As afterthat we have seen worst phase/face of our indian mentality 1984 sikh massacre .<a href="">#neverforget84</a>

Wowo ham ye movie dekhne  theatre ja rahe hain

God wanted to play so sachin was born

I was also not born in 1983 but really excited to watch the 83 with our Dad and he again cheer now with me Indiaaa India

The ORIGINAL CAPTAIN 
What non sense using wrong captions should be sued 

Hey, in 1983 the population of India was only 75 crores. It was mentioned as Rs 100 crore. Hey people of the film industry, please take care of something.
Sachin is only one

Brother this fan made he has taken 100 cr. Said the people of India
Sachin played for himself to made personal records, he never bordered about win of India. Hats off to Kapil Paa Ji and MSD those played for India not for their individual records. For me Sachin was an opportunities who used Indian Cricket Team for his personal ambitions.....

Who is watching this video in 2021? ️️️

Nice.... But 83 name should b replace as KD 83

Not better then Dhoni- Sushant Singh Rajpoot was 100000% times better then this ghamandi man.

In 1983, India's population was around 75 crores, not 100 crores.
Concept is good, we love kapil dev but actor playing kaplls roll is not capable for this roll, Same acting in every movie &quot;ranveer singh&quot; one of the worst actor, even he is not an actor. 0 star

Kapil dev 25 lakh chacha

Dailouge likh do india ki public to pagal or andhi hai hi.1983  m 100crore the to 2021m hum kitne ho gye honge

Madam, Kapil Dev ki trailer, Sachin Tendulkar ke batein aap unke video mein bathaiyega. Pathetic video. Agar sachin cricket ke bhagwan hai tho fir DON BRADMAN kon hai. Apni apni soch hai. KAPIL DEV, KAPIL DEV HAI AUR SACHIN TENDULKAR, SACHIN TENDULKAR HAI. HOW CAN YOU COMPARE. yeh dono apni waqt ke maharathi hain. Anchor ka kaam ek anchor hi kar saktha hai. Cricket is altogether a different and gentlemen&#39;s and gentlwomen&#39;s game.every player is important cannot compare any of them.

Kris Srikkanth aka Cheeka is awesome <a href="">

1983 me 100 crore nahi 83 crore the

Abey yeh toh kuch aur hi tha

Ush waqt 100 crore Hindustani nhi the, dialogue toh sahi rakhta

1983 Where was the population of My India 100cr?

Duplicate trailer h... Allaudin khilji ka dialouge h...editing achha tha

Sachin tendulkar.its..very good..pleyar all&#39;.. time&#39; maastar blastar..

My Cament highest LGA do please Sir

Super film 
I thought its real until i heard khilji

83 Movie is tribute to legend Kapil Dev

Blockbuster hogi

Bakvaas flopped
Lekin about 140 c +

1983 &amp; 2011 after these god only knows when world Cup win by our team

83 bol ke azahar trailer is being released
This is the difference between when doing movies for stardom and doing movies for acting. Not just Ranveer Singh there are so many talented people are in Bollywood. Especially Starkids they&#39;re only getting a chance to show their talent is biopics like this and lack of script selection. I&#39;m saying this movie will be the carrier best of Ranveer

Cheeka 
At 1st glance i thought it was real Kapil Dev . Damn.. Ranbir is really an Amezing actor ️

2019 World cup ka final ka result Newzealand was win tha world cup

Ranbir Singh is like Alauddin Khilji, don't show anything new in his language.
Mind blowing 1983 would cup team 🇮🇳 impossible to possible ️️️️️️
Useless movie with no fact checking..back then population was 100 crores or less 

Kis gareeb ka film ka role mara hai nepokid ranveer ne kya pata????

&quot;yeh taufa humne khudko dia hai&quot; is missing 

100 carors nahi thi..

It’s not a trailer. Also the clips are from South Indian movie jersey

Is movie ke trailer ke beech mei padmavat ka dialogue kyu hai . !

Bullshit video. Past me jaake kyu kuchh badalna. Everything happens for a reason. Either it is destined to happen or it happens because of the you take in your life. Own them and move forward. The life is ahead and not in past. Move forward and keep smiling!

There was a population of 66 crores and the dialogue was 100cr.kaa mar ra mtlb kuch bhi bnadoge.

This is not 83 trailer this is jersey telugu movie trailer

This video's starting dailog is shayad dhoni kohli shastri ne nhi sunne shyd.. Kyuki tendulkar sir has won the world championship after his departure.. Miss you team tendulkar (sehwag gambhir yuvraj irfan yusuf uthappa)
Here we won the World Cup the day before...nobody cares...and people in India don't need it...that's why players take so much pressure...
what was the population of India at the time of winning our first world Cup

It&#39;s so special.

&quot;Pahle maine isse like kiya tha fir dislike aur report dono kiya...&quot;

The first mistake in the trailer of the film is that India's population in 1983 was not 100 crores.
Fake

Let’s not support Bollywood trash where people like SSR had to die due to Nepotism and druggies like Dipika!!!

Chutiya trailor... Mixing of every cricket and padmavat movie..

Charsi also had cricketer
And most of the comments are I see are SSR fans .. how stupid can anyone get. He was an actor! So is Ranveer!Both are loved by various people for their different skills. SSR was good. But Ranveer is good too.I can&#39;t understand these fans, when SSR was alive and was boycotted, noone spoke a word, now that he&#39;s dead, people treat him like a soldier. Grow up people.

Would love and Wish to see SSR in this role SSR will alwz remain in our heart ️till he gets justice will Boycott every bollywood film.

Ranveer Singh has become a super star only Sushant Singh Rajput sir has released Ranveer Singh's movie Ram Lila Bajirao Mastani or many other movies have been released by Sushant Singh Rajput Sir.
It was Congress government's politics to give all such facilities to Sachin Tendulkar.
Common and boring Bollywood story. These days nobody care for Kapil Dev.  <a href="">LOL.So</a> get ready for the disaster.

Horrible dialogue delivery...Ranveer go watch Dhoni move.. and learn something.. from SSR.BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU WATCH DHONI 10000000 TIMES ALSO WILL NOT LEARN ANY THING ..BCOZ... U ARE AN DASH HOLE

Eagerly awaiting to see the Kapil da and team !!

Kamine puri video fake hai

BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD.JUSTICE FOR SSR

Sunil grover is best for this role.

This is not the official trailer:clips have been used from film jersey of south and the audio from padmaavat

Where did those blue jerseys come from in 1983?
Same dialogue delivery as in padmaavat.. so disappointing ..Ek hi formula se saare problems Hal nahi Hote ranveer sahb.. grow up man, &amp; try to be a good cator

It will b a super flop movie. Ms dhoni was a successful movie its bcoz of mind blowing performance from our beloved sushant sir

Sachin played as many balls in tests in 24 years as Dravid played in 16 years.
Buycott this movie

Sachin may say that he is God for some people..but Sachin has been like this for 24 years..not leaving the MTLB team or not taking retirement has ruined the future of many talented batsmen..Sachin also knows this..this is Sachin It would be wrong to eat God..
Dialogue to lag rha 'Bajirao' There is pain in my act..
It suits one and only for Sushant Singh Rajput . We miss you legend 

It&#39;s fake video it&#39;s Telugu movie of hero Nani . jersey movie

Sushant as dhoni  ranveer as kapil
Chotiya hai to koi trailer says hi nahi to Jersey ms dhoni

Bhai ab to iski dialog delivery overacting jaise lgne lagi koi smjao ise khilji hogya phle hi har jagah wo ni chlega... And jaha tak is movie ka sabal hai it&#39;s far from reality once I had seen the interview of 1983 team and they were like chilling and had no intentions or pressure of making to the final or winning the cup since nobody expected from them at that time but they did it and I was a great journey for them... This movie is a shit unnecessary emotional scenes and dialog dalenge.  Ab Biopic ko to dhandha smj liya as if every biopic will make history ..

He&#39;s looking like a joker as usual 

Ssr would have don better

If Insabka group had not happened then today Sushant would have been far ahead of everyone. I hate bollywood actors.
Make a movie on Yuvraj
it will be over acting

lagta hai lockdown k baad in logo ko he kamana hai

Why did Kabir Khan come? Why did Kapil Dev come true?
Sushant shing only fan

Nani natural star

N one thing this trailer is nothing but cuts from the movie &#39;&#39;Jersey&#39;&#39; ..

Would like to change the result of May 2019 semi-final
How did Ranveer bat in the name of acting?
Brother this is jersey movie trailer not 1983 

<b>a gold moment which changed the future of cricket in india</b>

Whose aaaya dheka 1.3M viewers haaa
Kapli dev jaisa koi nahi he, Ranveer Singh is wrong choice for play Kapil&#39;s role. It would be super flop.

Boycott hai uncle, don&#39;t try

The way in which MS Dhoni's movie was filmed, it was shown so beautifully in the main movie that MS Dhoni's story was shown live, it was so realistic that even in the trailer of the movie, no one could make a mistake, just by counting, how many movies were made on sports related. hogi usmain sabse best MS dhoni thi sab best tha mujhe sports main sabse best MS dhoni hai  Baki our Saina Nehwal movie ka wait karrahi thi but now after watching the trailer  I feel tha mujhe sports main sabse best MS dhoni is just like that Look main our false dialogues write main  I didn't even get to know that Saina movie's trailer saw these memes &quot;chaina wall&quot; What tab did you find?
Fake trailer.....Saala Azhar and Bajirao's mixture was made...
