Hello viewers and listeners.We are Kurds living in the Middle East. The Kurdish language and culture are in danger of extinction. I want to say that all the Kurds who express this, who say that this situation is important and really painful, or rather all the Kurds who resist, are under both military and political pressure.Let the whole world know about it Please hear our voicesBecause of this issue, thousands of our friends have been imprisoned and we are afraid.

O my gosh! 6.2 billion views only 18 million people have not listened to it in the world (if i am not wrong ) by the way this masterpiece deserves it streaming it from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳

I can&#39;t believe that this was so popular. Are the last couple of genrations tone deaf?

What&#39;s the catch here? After all, there must be some explanation for such a number of views for a far from masterpiece composition.

2024 very great!

Hey dude, here speaking a total failure in maths so I could be wrong but it shouldn&#39;t be  +  x  =  -  ·/·  or  +  ·/·  =  -  x  ? Meaning to reach the balance the amount you add and multiply has to be equal to the amount you take out and divide respectively ? Bah, who knows, who cares, not me (well, maybe a little actually). The Greater Universal Equational Balanced Scheme of Little Big Perfect Imperfect Things will prevail anyways. That&#39;s why pale shaped individuals like you and dark shaped individuals like the chick appearing in the video attract one another like opposite magnets regardless of our lousy math skills. Just keep multiplying, adding, dividing or whatever ok ? LET&#39;S ROCK !!!

Terrible awful song. Maybe the worst ever written

Never heard of him .Curious after watching a Netflix movie &quot;Yesterday &quot;

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕🎉

Hello, the clip is too beautiful I don't understand the lyrics but from what I see it's a cupid's move and the end of the clip is just perfect. One day my battles will be shared with a man and this man will put an end to it. to my battles 😊

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing&#39;, ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’. <a href="">#EdSheeran</a> <a href="">#ShapeOfYou</a> <a href="">#divide</a>
