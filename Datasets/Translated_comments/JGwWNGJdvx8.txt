Hello viewers and listeners.We are Kurds living in the Middle East. The Kurdish language and culture are in danger of extinction. I want to say that all the Kurds who express this, who say that this situation is important and really painful, or rather all the Kurds who resist, are under both military and political pressure.Let the whole world know about it Please hear our voicesBecause of this issue, thousands of our friends have been imprisoned and we are afraid.

Hey dude, here speaking a total failure in maths so I could be wrong but it shouldn&#39;t be  +  x  =  -  ¬∑/¬∑  or  +  ¬∑/¬∑  =  -  x  ? Meaning to reach the balance the amount you add and multiply has to be equal to the amount you take out and divide respectively ? Bah, who knows, who cares, not me (well, maybe a little actually). The Greater Universal Equational Balanced Scheme of Little Big Perfect Imperfect Things will prevail anyways. That&#39;s why pale shaped individuals like you and dark shaped individuals like the chick appearing in the video attract one another like opposite magnets regardless of our lousy math skills. Just keep multiplying, adding, dividing or whatever ok ? LET&#39;S ROCK !!!

Who&#39;s here to feel that nostalgia

once a wise man said:

&quot;when you&#39;re happy you enjoy the melody but, when you&#39;re broken you understand the lyrics&quot;...

Yes I am hahaha I watched it with the full date 
Here

I was curious about what my dad was listening to, so I listened to it and was hooked by the pitch (I don't understand English )
Bravo chicken man

No matter how many years pass, this song will stay in our hearts forever!

This song with prime Madrid match so well

Love from Bangladesh üáßüá©

Hello, the clip is too beautiful I don't understand the lyrics but from what I see it's a cupid's move and the end of the clip is just perfect. One day my battles will be shared with a man and this man will put an end to it. to my battles
