Watch the trailer to the most awaited movie of the year - Mission Mangal - starring Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Sonakshi Sinha and Taapsee Pannu, directed by Jagan Shakti : <a href="">

half way through this trailer i realized i already watched this movie lol

Anil and Sonam, my two favorite together.

Bakwas Movie hai

I watched this film last week. Exciting. ❤
I don't know what you want with this movie of yours. What do you want to make people understand that marriage or love of the same gender is a normal thing? No, of course it is wrong. I mean, if this whole world were transformed into the fact that everyone loves the same gender, it is impossible. You would be able to transform a stupid world into a right, a meaningless world. Praise be to God for the blessing of peace. You are corruptors of the earth.
It&#39;s sad to see tht this LGBTrash fever is hitting India too, moreover they making her a muslim girl🧕 , we Muslims we know wht is haram will remain haram forever.

Beautiful movie ❤
Against natures law 🎎
Bakwas

There is a reason why this movie was flop

The acting of Anil Kapoor, Madhumalati Kapoor, Brijendra Kala, Regina Cassandra, Abhishek Duhan, Alka Kaushal, Seema Pahwa, Sara Arjun, Rajkummar Rao entertains. The entire supporting cast, the scene, the city 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The diary that the art department has used is amazing.👩‍🎓🌄
Im not even gay but this I can’t express how i felt watching this movie. Never cried so much. Hats off to the director for making such movie let alone a <b>bollywood</b> movie!

Pari Rekha. 😲🤩😍😍Wows. R. R. ❤❤
When i was watched the promotion of the movie i thought it the usual movie but when i saw the trailer then i realise that this is the best movie, but unfortunately some indian cant understand this

Bakwaas boring bekar time West 👀

Everyone is crying in the comment section

As an Indian bi woman who is in love with another woman. This movie made me feel really really seen and the whole last part where her dad stands for her just had me crying so hard. Because I’m the kinda child whose whole life is her dad and loves him more than anything in the world and just thinking about how if I told him who I love he might not accept me just is so sad. And her dad accepting her really did make me feel like there is hope for me. Honestly a great movie.

I watched this film with no expectations. I have always been finicky about films. But I am telling ya&#39;ll  , after watching this I didn&#39;t regret it. This movie was sooo good. As someone who was very young and didn&#39;t have any knowledge towards this community but was still very open minded , I was willing to learn. I had no idea it was LGBTQ film , but when I got to know, I was smiling the whole time.

A pure love story that made us all cry. Thank you from lebanon🌠

its trash🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
True love bhi nasib walon ko milta h kuch log love ko ek timepass ka khel smjhte h or khel khtm hote hi emotions ki parwah kiye bina move on kr jate h nye ki talash me. Yrr pyar sirf pyar hota h koi khel nhi ya koi soda nhi ki soch smjh kr kiya jaye. This movie inspired me that I can admit that who m i . I m special from others. I hv feelings for girls....

Darshan&#39;s voice is sooo adorable 🙌🙌💙💙
This is not fair apne love marriage kiya or movie me arrange marriage kiya bhot Galt kiya

I cry for the guy

I love the fact that they straight-baited all the bigots. A phenomenal movie, with an even more phenomenal cast!!

Bollywood wants to destroy the roots of India but it will not happen. What is everyone's problem today? Bollywood is a khatam but India and our roots are still alive. The enemy has found few ways to counter India's main Hindu Muslim issue but very soon this issue will also be destroyed. The plan of hating same sex or own people will never succeed. Humanity mainly accepts the same sex which makes it sick but does not make it sick as a need for human.
Why the fucking fuck was I not aware about this film being lgbtqia+ 😭😭😭😭

Wher i can see the movie

Amazing acting amazing story ❤️❤️
I am myself is a straight but I really recommend to watch this movie, it can be anyone in your family who are going through so much pain just because they are different from you. Everyone wants to be get accepted for who they are and if you can&#39;t accept them at least don&#39;t make fun of them. I felt the loneliness he or she has to go for being different. Loneliness is not when you are alone in the crowd, loneliness is something where your loved ones don&#39;t accept for who you are

Unexpected story😱😱
Cried watching the trailer, SOBBED in the theater seat, and still got goosebumps and tears in my eyes thinking about now years later. The impact this film had on my life, personally, is impossible to overstate

Hate this movie 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
What did you say to someone in Hindi comment?
I looked at a girl and felt like this
I respect LGBTQ, in India

Please full movie you tube par

This is watched today hat&#39;s off

So nice movie❤️
<a href="">1:55</a> got goosebumpsThis is the power of darshan&#39;s voice 💓

Ye movie ka link please send me

Why are you making a movie of this story, brother, I am tired of watching it again and again, I have learned a lot from South India 😟😟

India need more these kind of movie to be well literate and learn to accept people the way they are

Lemme sob for a few mins

Simeone give me this movie link

WLW? Yass finallyyy

<a href="">2:08</a> girl&#39;s too ecmvery single boy 😂😂😂😂😂

This film wasn&#39;t appreciated? Hadd hai yaar, amongst Bollywood&#39;s attempts at representing LGBT+ love stories, this one looked the most promising....

Does this movie have a happy ending for the gl couple?

Hero you will lie down
Anyone after the trailer?
Truely Underrated movie 🙌🏼

Sonam kapoor rocked the role 👏

This movie really changed my point of view on lesbians. Now, I really support them.

I&#39;m a Bangladeshi girl and I&#39;m Pansexual. Sometimes I feel like I have to hide myself all my Life and to be honest I know I have to. But even if I have to sacrifice my happiness the only thing I&#39;ll ever wish for is, This society to be a little bit more friendly with us. It&#39;s who we are and we can&#39;t help it the only thing we can do is to hide ourselves until we die!🙂💔

Mujhe ye movie ka link dedona🥺

I believe someday my love will too fall in love with me 🥺🥺

GL?!! OMGGGG

Seeing a girl, it felt like this. Seeing a girl, it felt like a blooming rose, like a poetic dream, like a ray of light, like a deer in a forest, like a moonlit night, like a soft dew, like a lamp in a temple, looking at a girl, it felt like that. Verse 2]Ho, it felt like looking at a girl. It felt like looking at a girl. Like the form of the morning, like the winter sunshine, like the place of Vienna, like the life of the colors. Like the blooming bells, like the play of the lion. The cool breeze that brings fragrance, to a girl. Looked like this[Verse 3]Ho, looked at a girl felt like this Looked at a girl felt like this Like a dancing peacock, like a silk thread, Like the sound of a fairy, like the fire of a sandal, Like sixteen rings, like the rain's mist, Like a sigh that feels intoxicating, I felt like seeing a girl
Super movie
My goodnessA very good story with great casting but unfortunately the lead actress looked very uncomfortable in the character of the lesbian.Why do the character you don&#39;t believe in? Pathetic actressThe other actress very amazing.

Even if the movie isn’t perfect and some things could have been improved on, I still truly appreciate the initiative and I thank the people who made the decision to make a movie on this subject matter in an era when it’s much required. As a bisexual girl I cried watching the movie and I thought of my girlfriend. I am grateful that I didn’t have as many struggles with my sexuality and my parents also don’t have a problem with that, I mean I’m thankful I didn’t have obstacles and that I found mutual love being queer. I’m lucky that my girlfriend came in my life. All that said, I understand that it’s not the same with every queer person and most of us have to struggle all life to catch a breath and be our true selves. I feel deeply sorry for such people and I hope you are freed from your suffering and that you find happiness and peace.

Please! Don&#39;t go against nature Just becoz you are superior than other animals

This movie is not on you tube kya kidar milegi plz. Reply
The movie was okay, the story did the right thing but it didn't explain what needed to be done.
Ghatiya movie. They are spreading vulgarity by making such type of movies and destroying the family system by manipulating the minds of youngsters.

We need more of lgbtq awareness in bollywood and indian cinemas🏳️‍🌈

Seriously this is one of the best Bollywood works

Love this movie

It was decent movie. Thank God for that, family can watch together.

Best movie so far 😭😭😭
Loved every bit for it ✨✨
Watching this 2 yrs later and i still feel the same goosebumps and quivering excitement i felt when I watched it for the first time...

The two girls had zero chemistry, good story but not believable becsuse of bad acting

Saluto to tongue 👅 and finger👆

SPOILER ⚠️While I watched the movie, I wished real people could change their conservative minds too the way they did in the movie through the way of that play, because I knew that real people will still remain the same even after watching the movie. And I was right because I can still see some homophobic comments here.

India deserve more movies like this ❤️

I Don&#39;t like LGBTQ people

Its weird how everyone is suddenly bisexual or lesbian in the comment section

The concept could have been presented more appropriately if &quot;Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga&quot; was sung by a female singer.

Indian movie bkwassss nowadays.. Pyar mohabat relation pyar mohabat relation... Reality, emotional, Drama, war everything u will find in Hollywood movies.. Hindi movies useless only love story.. Sikho bollywood hollywood seh...

I&#39;m in love with this trailer. I&#39;m gonna watch this movie soon.Happy pride🌈🌈

i cannot help it if i as a woman have feelings towards women, and i relate to sweety so much, what she went through growing up. i felt all of that

0: 45 plz tell me full song lyrics

Satyamev jayate story lines and u made it amir khan that&#39;s why i m biggest fan of urs....

Promoting homosexuality
Parents should support LGBT

Its true, right? If true love doesn&#39;t have a happy ending, then its not true love. I really don&#39;t understand why families and people say I&#39;m not proud you when they come out!! Hello...we didn&#39;t destroy up the Maglyan or something. We just told you about our sexuality!! That&#39;s it. And If you can&#39;t accept it, then we&#39;re also not proud of you. Bcoz you&#39;re denying someone to love.

Please full movies daliye

We want more bollywood films about LBGTQ+ community 🥺

the title track by darshan raval is awesome a....

I think This is the only one LGBTQ movie which can be watched with your family without a little bit discomfort... it&#39;s So light... So cool...

Lesbian 😯👍
its 29th may 2021i am so happy that everyone is coming here to post their perspective after watching the movie ..... and talking about this superb masterpiece ... i am so late to watch this but i can say ... its a great movie... i love sonam&#39;s and rajkumar&#39;s acting in the movie ... have fun ...and stay safe guys... ❇️

You did not watch the tube but saw a girl and started watching this movie.
I&#39;m a gay guy from Bangalore. So, I had to watch this. I remember people in theatre laughing, trolling and bad mouthing when the lesbian scenes came. I was disgusted with people&#39;s instant reaction. People&#39;s mentality still living in 1900&#39;s.

Subh mangal zyada sandhan and ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga..... Two gems of Bollywood industry ❤

Huge respect for Sonam, for doing such a bold film role!

Bollywood we want more movies like this ❤️

We want more scenes of kuhu and sweety ❤️🥺

People can be lesbians but people can be gay I don&#39;t understand. Yak

Super sunm Kapoor with you Kapil Sharma you hahakhuss ❤️🔥👏 you

I can&#39;t believe its already been 2 years....favorite movie of all time yaar

Yeh to ek dum saf sutra gandu giri   hai bhai

They Straight-Baited the shit out of this movie. And I love them for that. So many people watched this anticipating a Guy-Girl love story who would have never watched this beautiful story if they knew the truth. I kinda hate the people for that reason. But this is clearly a start towards a better future. A better society.

Worse movie in Bollywood. dint expect that Rajkumar would role this kind of movie

Movie was good but the message of movie was ridiculous

❤❤❤❤one of my favs from 2019

Anybody here after Chakra movie

I loveeeee these songs in here but does she end up with a girl ??

Sonam is a kind of other World girl who proves that with her film choices ❤️. Perhaps her acting skill is not so very well but she always trying to her best &amp; she has also many types of talents like she has huge knowledge of fashion industry , clothing, politics etc. Overall her personality, body language, mentality is more appreciable than her acting but she has a big courage which not another talented actresses has . After governments in each country  Celebrities has the major power to change the world by  through showing theirs films. Like Hollywood industry is did they make a different kind of movies &amp; Netflix webseries in every topics. which make peoples understood the difference between right &amp; wrong &amp; the facts.🙏

Buht ghatiya movie thi jahil log

this made me cry

Mujhe muvi chahiye  please

Juhiiii &lt;3 love!
I cried so so much watching this film. As an indian lesbian, it felt very, very hard. And, at times you don&#39;t believe you can have a happy ending, let alone love.  I am so so grateful to the director for making this film, and everyone who contributed to it. I wish I could like it a million times. I am very emotional. Just thank you.

Congratulations for 2 years of Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga

Thank God this movie tanked. We still have some hope in humanity

Nice ☺😇☺🙂
Love is love. If we leave out the gender we get a broader viewpoint. If u feel comfortable and happy with that person then be with that person. Why let other people&#39;s judgement in ur wayYour parents taught you what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad but ur love life is for u to control they can&#39;t decide who you should love. You can love whoever you want don&#39;t let other people stop u from loving the person who gives u happiness ❤️

Katae chutiya movie dudeMera fav actor hai rajkumar but yh movie katae chutiya lgi ksm se

Noone is talking About Rajkummar Rao 🥺

I felt like seeing a girl
Still get goosebumps watching this

Love has no gender,if you are happy &amp; comfortable with the person that&#39;s only matter. Love is Love. Thank you bollywood &amp;Ek ladki Ko dekha to Aisa Laga team for making this.its beautiful 😚😚😚😚🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈Everyone&#39;s have the right to be love.In my opinion don&#39;t look the genders just consider that you are happy &amp; comfortable with your person.

Never ever thought that this movie would come out as a lesbian romance 👀

Best movie ,,,,,,,feel proud from lgbt community

So much straight baiting is required for the general indian audience to watch a movie of lgbtq+ representation...as much as I am grateful, this makes me think, will I never be accepted??

Anil Kapoor tried to show that he was Buddha but he still looks young.
Wonderful film ❤️❤️❤️
Her dialogs &amp; expressions gives me no feelings what so ever..

This type of film which legitimizes homosexuality or lesbianism is an incitement to depravity and unnatural practices.
This movie deserve to be watched it&#39;s shows that we are totally wrong about love love it&#39;s not about your gender it&#39;s about your heart not just because you&#39;re a boy you should mary a girl or the opposite it&#39;s about for who you are falling

yuck

Ful video kh pa h
The only film of Sonam I love

Wow Sonam she is queen 😍😍😍
cant find this movie anywhere

Good start bollywood 👍
Yar you tub per yeh full movie download krdain plz

This movie trailer made me emotional I cried because I wasted my <a href="">2:35</a> minutes of my life watching this stupid trailer

When darshan ravel voice come
Full movie kaho nahi han
I am not crying you are! 😭❤️❤️❤️
I want to see this movie someone plzz help to watch this movie

Here only for Regina Cassandra ♥️
Nice movie

Please someone should answer me where I&#39;m i going to find the full movie?

Just watched on Netflix. Absolutely. Beautiful. It may not be getting the accolades it deserves because the &quot;straight baiting&quot; is strong. I knew prior to watching the, about the gay storyline, but anyone else may assume it&#39;s just a &quot;typical&quot; romance movie. All of the characters made it one of the best LGBT movies I have seen in a long time.

Why haven&#39;t I seen this film earlier???? Groundbreaking &lt;3

Boycott Kapoor&#39;s

Boycott nepotism
This movie literally describes me Im a lesbian in the closet and also Indian and my parents r homophobic! UGHHHH!!! Any advice??

I love you anil kapoor my life

I just saw this movie, sad reality and a wake up call. Hope this message gives us all education about lgbtq, this is not an illness for god&#39;s sake! Its a feeling, its inside of us. NOTHING and definitely NO ONE can ever change what we feel and how we feel.. so parents, stop forcing your children to do something against their will and definitely enough with this fvcking arrange-marriage! You are destroying your children&#39;s happiness! Neither your religion or god can change the &quot;natural&quot; feeling. Dont be selfish uneducated parents! Wake up!!

i initially had no idea when i started watching this movie that what was gonna happenbut by the time as it unfolded its theme man............i was literally blown away by the plotit tried to make awareness abt what is required right now in india( that&#39;s the race three got popular and not this)rajkumar&#39;s acting on the spot as alwayscan&#39;t say abt sonum but tried her best others did well toothis was kind of a revolutionary movie i should sayand 1000000x   better than race 3.that&#39;s it go and watch it.amazing movie

This movie contains rare concept...but it goes fail bcz of Sonam&#39;s being nepotism ptoduct...and the whole film trailer dowsnt even show the another girl from tamil I.think...

Watched on Netflix for raj Kumar rao. Enjoyed watching Regina, juhi n anil kapoor too. Message n loneliness made me cry coz its true

Sonam kapoor what she is doing acting or over acting . Her acting is just like💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Lake of lanat kanjero
i hate bollywood murder dirty log hain transgender khusre bhi inse better hai
She is very bad looking girl

Who is she her acting is very bad

Sonam is such a bad actress when she cry on the screen it feels like she smelled someone shiting 🤣🤣

i cried for the complete last 30 minutes. i love this movie.

this movie is great
We who have watched this movie have told Sonam to go to her room and did what she did with one of them.
Yar itni gandi film Jo brain wash Kare ge ye family ko khrb Kare ge

Movie full bhejo

Stupid and disgusting movie of the year

When are you going to relax? Plz 🙏 Donate by relaxing 👍👍👍
Hamare society family ko aise hi movie ki need hai thora to thought improve hogi

Thats Bollywood for you they focused more on daughter father instead of proper love. This is nothing compared to call me by your name but beware the after affects of that movie is so intense it may take weeks to rectify.

behoda yr logon ko samajh nai a rahi k woh kiya gand phela rahe hein or oper se in tareef kar rahein hein gandhe log

I want a Indian girl 😭😭😭💔
yes a religious muslim guy is explaining a punjabi lesbian girl that giving up on her sexuality to satisfy her family is bullshit and she should never give up on her happiness? wow

I cry every time I watch this film - so beautiful and exactly what I went through (sans being accepted at the end).

Just Love it....this movie is sooooo related.☺️Wish everyone very well

I just saw the movie and it&#39;s great, i cried because it&#39;s very relateble to me. I&#39;m so glad such film finally gets to Bollywood. great cast too, Sonam Kapoor did a great job.

Only those people can feel this pain who go through it. 😔😢😒

The movie is very beautiful...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤When I saw a girl, I felt so good 🙏🏻
superb movie, ♥️♥️
I just want to say that&#39; Love is love&#39;

Dance choreography: <a href="">

There are gay and lesbian couple in Bollywood and I am writing their shipping name 1.Jitendra+Ayushmann = Jitushmann2.Sonam+Regina = ?Can anyone complete the shipping name of Sonam and Regina? Please

A girl loves a girl, the movie may seem a little different, but it is for those families whose children are like this, i.e. a boy likes a boy and not a girl, or a girl likes a girl and not a boy. I don't know if this is a disease or something else, but I have learned from this movie that nothing is bigger than love. Rest you watch the movie.
lesbian of indian descent here! this looks like a masterpiece, and i&#39;m still so sad that i can&#39;t watch it. (also apparently these are the people who made 3 idiots so i know this film is gonna slap)

this and shubh mangal zyada saavdhan are the holy duo of gay bollywood🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

I love how hey straight baited everyone

the heterobait I love it

I had no idea that this was about Lesbian couple. Why nobody talked about it!!!?? 😭

I am as different from you as you are from me...And that places us at the same starting point...So we shall ride together, Through this beautiful journey of life, With compassion, understanding, acceptance, And most importantly, Love.❤❤❤<b><i>Live &amp; let live.</i></b>Greetings from Sri Lanka.

Thank you so much for making this movie. Came out to my parents after watching it.

That twist 😑😑😑😑

I want  to see  this movie.

Wonderful movie
All the homophobes in the comments saying this movie baits them... Uh yeah i sure hope it does

It&#39;s waste of time in my life . It&#39;s not a normal life . It&#39;s totally sick life .

<a href=""> Listen to my channel..i need subscribers

The concept of the movie was amazing but it was not presented in the right way..the only thing missing was not connecting the people.
LOLAt last Bollywood sucks 😝Mother fuckers nothing positive to show as its happening in real in so called Democratic India 👎

Movie of the year.. awesome

I like Sonam performance in only two movies 1. Neerja 2. Ek ladki toh dekha toh Aisa Laga

OH MY GOD..!!!! I am literally CRYING right now..!!! Idk what to say or do..But....First of all thank u so much to everyone who participated in making this great film.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏I don&#39;t know what Indian parents will react to it..I just hope this film would have a POSITIVE review and lotss of SUPPORT..Ummm...I...I.......IS IT WRONG IF I SAY I AM ONE OF THOSE SWEETIES? Umm....IS IT WRONG IF I SAY I....I ALSO LIKE A GIRL?IS IT WRONG IF I SAY I ALSO HAVE NO FRIENDS?IS IT REALLY WRONG THAT I ALSO FEEL LONELY AND SMALL IN THIS BIG WORLD BECAUSE I CAN&#39;T SHARE MY FEELINGS WITH ANYONE?I don&#39;t know if its right or wrong..BUT YES I AM ONE OF THOSE SWEETIES. AND I ONLY WISH FOR ONE THING THAT I CAN HAVE A GIRL LIKE KUHU IN MY LIFE AND ALSO I WISH FOR MY FAMILY TO ACCEPT ME THE WAY I AM BECAUSE.........I DON&#39;T WANNA BE LONELY ANYMORE...I AM JUST SO TIRED OF ALL OF THIS LONELINESS AND THE HEAVINESS IN MY HEART🙏Once again a BIG THANK U to this film👏👏🙏🙏

This movie is available on Netflix. You&#39;re welcome.

Who came after watching brain wash

😭😭😭 Whoever is supporting lesbians here, remember that no society accepts lesbians or gays because it is against nature if the same gender is promoted, remember that girls will marry girls. Or what will boys do or what physical needs will be poor from the same gender to which no psycho patient will be born or child will be born from where will the world run, how will nature's balance be destroyed so plz don't promote bad things in society. When all your wives become lesbians, then you will know that the purpose of celebrity is only to earn money, make India a western country, the cultural literacy here is great, my India is great, let us remain great 🇮🇳
It was one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen in my life!!!  I watched it yesterday right after I watched the trailer. It was outstanding!!!  Hats off to you sonam kapoor, and to you too Regina Cassandra!!!

God even India where i thought sacred is upside down i will not be watching these movies its my choice my decision you all gone to the ???????? Wow no no no

Shreyas Talpade &amp; Juhi Chawla ❤
Rajkummar Rao &amp; Shivangi Joshi ❤
Ranbir Kapoor &amp; Sonam Kapoor ❤
Where to watch this?

A beautiful movie. So relatable!

I am a lesbian girl from India and after watching this trailer I felt so so good that now bollywood has started directing such movies..and hatss of to sonam kapoor for playing such a incredible role.and the comments section is so positive . Those who have unliked this video we can&#39;t call them <a href="">humans.so</a> love is Love and don&#39;t be afraid of who you are. Be you and be proud of yourself 😊❤

These motherfuckers are bent on destroying culture
This is an illnesses and the western culture is also going through bad phase bcz of all these wrong type of love and be sure not to get excited by all these or else your natural process of making love will get wasted

Okay I did not see that coming, and I must say it was a very pleasant surprise. Even bigger surprise was the comment section, India has truly come a long way.Glad to see the wave of change in Bollywood ^_^

<a href="">#SetLoveFree</a> <a href="">#LetLoveBe</a> Love really has no boundaries.I&#39;m telling this because I&#39;m an Indian bisexual girl.

As I&#39;m a gay man from Pakistan belongs to typical Punjabi family  ...I had suffered almost the same childhood as shown in this movie ....No one here to understand you .. you have to live in just your own made world ...now going to finish my teenage hoping a best future as a gay man Pakistan ....Nice efforts by great Sonam Kapoor she is really supporting LGBT community she was one of the earliest actress who gave statement when indian government legalized homosexuality.

I was bated in to watching this disgusting movie on Netflix. Imagine the same exact movie but instead of a girl its a pedophile trapped inside a glass cube wanting someone to release him lol pathetic

The only movie which made me cry. Thank you Sonam and Anil Kapoor. Lots, lots and lots of love from Pakistan.(LOVE can never be wrong).

damn asi movie par
I literally can&#39;t find any negative comment.PROUD 🌈

Who is the other lead actress????

Bht e fazool theme tha is movie ka

I want movies like this. But what to do, max. Indian audience will not accept this. India likes Rohit Shetty films, Soo saddd

I salute Sonam Kapoor for selecting this role. She may not be so talented like kangana or tapsee but she has lot of guts, one of the most versatile acctress in Bollywood. Those who agree hit like

Kitny cheap mentality me indulge hn ye ghtyaa log ghinn aati ay
Damn this movie was excellent. Better than what I expected.

Finally people need to understand love is love don&#39;t judge..😍

This movie 🍿 all time favourite

I didn&#39;t hate it. But It&#39;s little bit wired you know!! I think it&#39;s just because I am not feeling like this persons. But kisi Ko agar aysa pyaar hota hai toh thik hai.. Koi nehi kar lene do ☺️☺️

<a href="">1:55</a>I love this music 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘For me, it&#39;s one of the best parts of Indian music 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

<a href="">1:36</a> repeat and repeat

Watch the trailer to the most awaited movie of the year - Mission Mangal - starring Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Sonakshi Sinha and Taapsee Pannu, directed by Jagan Shakti : <a href="">

I didn&#39;t see the movie, but from the comments I realized that&#39;s it about lesbian girl ... That&#39;s ugly really  please don&#39;t be a part  to support these community that&#39;s not nrml they are not nrml the should  realized that&#39;s not acceptable to get out of the nature ..... I ask God to show them the right way.. it&#39;s really sad to see  Young girls or boys  with career doing wrong things.. ask for help .. fight take traitement please Don&#39;t be gays

I watched the movie yesterday and it was really nice ❤💯👌🔥I really appreciated the fact that sahil aka rajkumar supported Sonam after knowing the truth about her sexuality 💕I started crying when Sonam came out to her family and explaining stuff like she was gonna compromise her life by staying alone , nobody understood her &amp; so on 😭😢 I&#39;m hoping to see more LGBTQ+ movies in Bollywood 💚👍

I think this is the only way to control India papulation .They will advertis  more and more

When will this movie come to you?

Boat Galt topic pe film hai

Being a lesbian and loving another girl doesn&#39;t make your love any lesser, love is love , all people have the right to decide who they want to spend their life with , I love this movie it brought tears in my eyes.True Love , I am so happy they finally have a lesbian themed movie in Bollywood.

Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa Laga is very very very very very nice movie...I really loved it! 😘😘

I am a lesbian woman from the United States. I loved this film!! I&#39;ve always wanted to visit India. I hope that one day I can. There&#39;s so much beauty in the world, we just have to open our eyes to see it! ❤️🏳️‍🌈

How can I watch this movie

Nauzbillah,,This film industry got damn fools,, they totally wants to bring Western culture in india too,, its not a natural thing its a virus which we need take strict actions towards it,, firstly this industry brought nudity in india by shorting clothes giving the names as modernism, and now they want to bring such stupidity in indian society, 80% they ruined the life of adults by giving false msg and now they want to raise the percentage of bisexuals.. Any how on last they want wild life as animals as they r forgeting or loosing the humanity!

Being a gay...I hope so....it could change the mindset of our people

Where can I watch this movie??

It&#39;s been four months since this movie came out and I still get goosebumps watching this trailer.  Easily my favorite movie of all time.

This illuminati promoting

the gay propaganda is taking over bollywood and this is what you get when trying to be hollywood

There is no limit in movie pay or anyone pays.. which band is making such things, what has been done is deadly movies, or sb.

Sometimes you should also show the love story of a Hindu boy or a Muslim girl..but this is not the same as the film industry..
B ml lol pub

Does anyone happen to know if it has been released in the US?

I think we should respect every ones feeling  l am with this film and the bisexual peoples

What movie is going on?
I wish the world would understand this.

lesbian love? Ok something new in Bollywood

Love this video from pakistan i wish pakistani cinema would make movie like this

Watched the movies. Made me heart stop for a second. Such a good movie for people who are hustling. Must watch! And good acting also

Really beautiful movie.

Y anywhere Regina&#39;s name was not mentioned???

I am a lesbian, I am watching this movie right now, it makes me so happy for India to be doing a movie like this. Congratulations to all the lgbt Indians out there this is great.

benchooo - damn you, who is the writer of the movie? Who made this movie? It's bad to watch the movie, but he has come only to curse you and comment on it. Bsdk 😡😡 Cheap Indian public 😡
It's a disease and must be cured... There will be destruction if it is legalized oh my Bollywood why 😥😥😥
Where can I find the pure movie?
Have you seen any clean text in the comment box after this?
One of the best Indian movies

I am a bisexual girl from germany. I don&#39;t know much about indian movies but I heard about this one and it looks beautiful. I think it is very important that girls like me all around the world should be able to see a story like this. They should be able to see that should they fall in love with a girl that does not make their love any lesser just because it is less common. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this movie. I might not know this culture very well but I know what that young woman is feeling. And seeing her love being shown as love is more important than I know how to express.

Want more movies like this

The film is mindblowing it&#39;s worth watching...but its saddening that hypocrites Indian people have not watched it yet .

Mind-shattering Movie Loved it❤️♥️♥️
I cried a few times, the way she describes her loneliness, not fitting in ever, not having any true friend and praying that she could wake up &#39;normal&#39;...is so relatable.

Eye opener we must become open accept all kind of human in our society All of them done good acting’s well made movie

This was such a beautiful concept!! I deeply admire the director and the cast! PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!

The concept of the movie is very good. Everyone has a fight to live a normal life.  If anyone is born LGBTQ, then it&#39;s not at all his fault.

Fucking Bollywood with this movie stop ruining my kids future.. ..because many of these kids are not gay but because of your movies they will think they are....Anil Kapoor has ruined bunch of our kids

I cried so much watching this movie because for the very first time, I truly saw myself represented in a woman of a Bollywood film. A huge round of applause to Sonam K Ahuja for taking this role and doing it justice and to VVC and Shelly Chopra Dhar for bringing this film to mainstream audiences. I am not out yet to my parents but I believe showing them this film will help me in that process. Art and film can truly help change mindsets &lt;3

Is se bakzzzz &amp; This is the worst movie I haven't seen till date...
I strongly recommend this movie to you guys honestly it’s such a beautiful movie watched it a month ago on Netflix I seriously don’t regret watching this movie... Such a pure touching story a movie that will make you laugh and cry at once. Was never a fan of Sonam Kapoor but after watching this movie I tripped over my feet for her &amp; Regina Cassandra but only for an actress. Not everyone is that lucky especially when it comes to religions and cultures...😔 But anyway it a beautiful movie and a very beautiful song aswell much love from South Africa 🇿🇦 💪🥰🙂

Watch a gay movie and feel like this
Hiii

Bkwas movie

Ge Vali movie

Just saw the movie......it will surely gonna make an impact and change people&#39;s perspective towards their society to some extent......but one thing I wanna say is that the main theme on which the movie is based was showcased only in last half an hour..... It would be different if the makers think out of this typical Bollywood way and concentrating more the main issue..... ..

Best movie  and logo ki soch to badle gi iss movie se bestsss movie

People hate what they don’t understand

<a href="">2:23</a>

Who came here after watching the world television premium...

Totally nonsense ..

Great movie

This is the most Bullshit movie I&#39;ve ever watched. This movie practices homosexual.I don&#39;t understand what made Anil Kapoor sign this movie

Bless these people who made this movie. I&#39;m gay and everything I&#39;m going through is exactly portrayed in the movie. Thank you so much for making a movie like this. I wish my parents will one day accept me. This movie just made me cry. A must watch.

Beshumar lanat lantieo eise filmo pe or tum logo pe

Nice trailer

just saw the moviethis will really help the orthodox society to think differentlyhatts off VVC.....after 3 idiots one more gem

shame on her for doing movie like this

Disgusting movie god please save all of us

She is a LesbianOh right....forgot to say <b>&quot;SPOILERS!&quot;</b>

this movie is so so important, i cried so much. the story is so well made and so relatable;; please please watch it

Nothing will be accepted against the bloody hell nature. There is no single minded person who understands the things. There is a system of society which is like this, we all love this world.
Kon SE movie h
why regina is here for a small role?

Exceptionally well potrayed movie...Love. Is whf matters.  Sonam super

Mast <a href="">#SparkCreativeSolutions</a>

when I saw trailer for first time, I thought it&#39;s regarding Sonam&#39;s career.. and was pleasantly surprised to see the movie and discover the truth.. :) &lt;3

ek ladki to dekha to aisha laga song
Why is Pankaj so angry?
Ladies and gentlemen this is India.....mashriq ke naam pe dhabba

Stupid movie. We are directly indirectly promoting such wrong relationships in society. These promotions are destroying the roots of morals of our upcoming and current generations. Aneel Kapoor, i am big fan of yours but please do not be part of such acts in future. Agr oper waly ny is rishty ko sahi karar dia hota tau aurat mard ka concept he na hota. This gora chamrri still wants to destroy us morally.

Who has seen this movie? Please tell me which movie is this?
WE NEED A SEqUEL ASAP!!!!!

Feel sorry for her lack of political  understanding...unfollowed...if that was normal then how does the puzzle fits...only man and woman fits...  they are just trying to fabricate the idea and making it normal ...i am sad the tools fr it are @anilskapoor family..👎

I have just watched the movie. The story is weak, the writing is dull. Rajkumar has done a decent job. Anil and Juhi has a funny and good chemistry. The movie is below average. The second half of movie drags the movie down. Sonam Kapoors so called acting is two demontionel. She has a happy and sad face, the girl cant act.

AMAZINGGGGG MOVIEEEE!!!!!!! LOVE IS LOVE NO MATTER WHICH GENDER!!! PEOPLE MUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A NEW WORLD......

Amazing movie Loved it ❤️❤️❤️
happy to see a mainstream cinema on lgbt community.. hope to see some more serious films like this on lgbt subject

Lesbians film 🤣🤣🤣
It is a psychological disease and is against the power this is a total useless movie from pakistan

Amazing movie which means a lot to many people &lt;3

Never in my life I thought I’d see a Indian/Punjabi LGBT movie as a Punjabi bisexual I am very proud of this movie and myself

It is a very beautiful movie...but when God makes us all the humans will be seen with the same eyes...such humans will be accepted without any discrimination when our society will accept them and humanity will prevail in the true minds.. ..
What? 🙈🙈🙈

Please upload the movie...

TopNice movie is good 🌹
Mar jau bhai Mar Mar Mar............
Happy this shit flopped. Aisi beemariyo ko panapna bhi nahi chahiye.

A movie that everyone will remember. And this movie can rock in the whole world. And this comment is after wathing the movie. Songs are all awesome.

As a bisexual 13 year old muslim......this movie was the best....it meant alot..that someone of indian faith made this movie....i saw it at home with my mom and dad ....my dad was so disgusted .....i wanted to give him a lecture about LGBTQ+ .....but he would have the idea that im bi....no one knows im bi ...but my older brothers know and they supporting me  ......being gay is not a disease nor an illness....so plz if u have un pleasant remarks leave them else where....💖

I worry for future and there is nothing sad about this situation of being lesbian.

Poison, for young people killing every beautiful relation between friends sisters brothers parents &amp; trying to celebrate wrong message in the name of love.. making fun of human relation Indian Cinema now helping to bring one to one concept &amp; telling people parents are old enough they don&#39;t understand life let them do whatever they do don&#39;t disturb them wow great lines!!... we really need education to understand what actually LOVE is...&amp; why we need! you need more search to highlight this issue &amp; its causes... moo utha ker movie bana dete hen kuch bhi

Its always made me sad to see how most Bollywood movies use homosexuality as a joke, like its only okay if we are making fun of it. I am so proud to see an open movie that actually explores a different relationship in such a pure way. This movie is amazing, emotional and expresses how I have felt growing up. It&#39;s hard coming out to your family when they can&#39;t understand you and don&#39;t give you a chance to be who you are because of what others will think and feel.

and another love story, cmonnnnnnnn

This movie just promot sinner. Actually they are giving wrong massage to youngsters. I realy not expect  that people wil appreciate to this movie.

After watching the trailer, no one can imagine what the movie will be like, if there is no lust in love then there will be no fear of deception.
i saw this movie last night on netflix and it was beautifully made, well done! 🙌🏼

People are changing. Their mindset is heading towards the right direction. So happy to see this

This is a sign of doomsday
I just watched it on Netflix and I loved it <3
Nonsense movie

Check my channel for the movie...

It&#39;s now on Netflix US.

I juz saw this movie and it&#39;s obviously the most unexpected love story of the year and is amazing💕!!!!

This movie, main to Indian media, has directly trained the children of today to be lesbians....Damn your idea or made a movie or you will finally die from the wrath of Allah one day you will accept Islam. Do this or live a pure life.... first movie related to the thin muashre, now you have become a muashre, all of you have once again been cursed to be numbered as Hindu people.
Insha Allah, you all are not saved from the wrath of Allah, those Hindus are just living in filth in the world... Everyone knows how bad we as ordinary people are... or Mere Allah Pak too. I don't like this harshly... You are a human being, why are you giving the concept of hating people by nature through such movies? You are saying that you can do whatever you want... You are because of the movies of people. There is a lot of devil in your mind, why don't you think that your mind is not pure...
I liked the movie its emotional Specially Anil Kapoor did great work.

What is India Gandu?
This movie is worth your time

MADAR CHOOD yeh bhi kiya movie hai ghaando log time waste karke rakh deya total chotiyapa tum harami log one of the worse movies i have ever watched fcuking so mad

ek dum bullshit movie bloody waste my time . making more spoiled hell the society simply against the nature is leading to homosexulity which is not acceptable

The main reason for Hindus is that Muslims are the main ones, that is why they have always praised Muslims in their movies. Shame on Bollywood and shame on those who watch such movies!!!!
nice movie, this kpr is showing his caste
So, Rajkumar Rao in yet another movie with LGBTQ theme.

Itni gndi movie or Sonam toh hr movie m bdi gndi lgti h
No comments
Hope this world will finally accept this beautiful relationship

This is going to be my first indian movie.

As first there many mixed reviews about this movie which was giving me mixed emotions about this movie. But after watching it, this movie is definitely representing LBGTQ in right direction. Even though it is subtle aspects of the movie, it does touch your heart! Great movie in my opinion.

lesbian Girl Friend 😂😂😅

i love Rajkumar rau acting
no gay niggas here

THIS MOVIE IS FINALLY ON NETFLIX ITS SO GOOD GUYS WATCH ITTTT 😭❤️🌈🌈🌈❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏
Is India Going to be homosexual? yes or no

By watching this trailer I guess Sonam is a lesbian

That&#39;s why ratings are so low. lol

Such a shame.

Now if only they put some representation on TV serials since that&#39;s what most people watch. Such an amazing time to be alive.

💙 Sonam Kapoor 💙
So basically Rajkumar Rao is Ross from friends here 🤔🤣🤣

Awsm concept can&#39;t wait to watch this movie.

I&#39;m seeking for a lesbian girl in Mumbai. Dm me on Instagram if interested . Trainwithprriya

very amazing story keep it up  🙌 people need to change if people can&#39;t don&#39;t talk about humanity also

These type of a movies sh0uld be encouraged 😊😊😊😊

I watched this film last month and thought it was very courageous and brave production ,and about time fore the LGBT community of India - but the film was a missed opportunity , badly directed and executed and I could&#39;nt get empathetic or connected with any of  the characters .Still ,it was a move forward.

Early lunch

😀

Super

Junnu Kumar
such a stupid movie for stupid peoples

where can I see it is spanish
Its dofficult to find a girlfriend, how do a lssbian can find another lesbian

Plz upload full movie



Very very happy to see that bollywood is also developing day by day . Its a best topic a best issue . Wish that by seeing this movie the thinking society will expend..And that it may helpful for all those people who have to face these problems..

Beautiful too look at, even if I don&#39;t speak any of the other languages, in India (other than English, of course).

Super cool
Raj Kumar Rao why do you cheat girls every time?
Sonam Kapoor's affair is going on with her father.. She is having sex with her father...
Love the <a href="">#LGBTQ</a> they have also feelings, must watch   the film in MH&amp;UP

This trailer is so subtle with the story&#39;s plot/implications...are they worried about backlash? I was expecting her being a lesbian to play a more prominent part in the trailer.



India is progressing forward. 👍Respecting from Bangladesh.

So many good reviews, so much support to the film, no hate comments.... Ok!!! bt i wonder why the film got flopped??? Can anyone explain?

I love it 😍 .I want to whatch this movie, but I’m living in Germany  :/ <a href="">#Letlovebe</a> 🏳️‍🌈😍

very nice video    ........

I love the commemt section!!! So many positive comments! I am not homophobic at all instead i support LGBTQ+. I really like how people are changing their mindsets... too bad this movie isnt releasing in my country because theres lgbt content. Anyways love u sonam!!!!!

Finally the lgbtq community has a new ray of hope in INDIA. we should love the person not the gender.thank u sonam for the beautiful movie👌

Why the heck rajkumar did this movie, again aisha type movie

No more behind the bars No more inside the closet We are out, loud and proud. So give us a shout out.Please watch &quot;Yaariyan Lgbt flash mob 2019&quot;<a href="">

A lot of respect for Sonam Kapoor for playing such a role ❤👍👍👍

I become a big fan of Rajkumar Rao bcoz of his acting... He is unique...❤👍

This story reminds me of the movie Jenny&#39;s wedding starring Katherine heigl and Alexis bledel... anyone with me?

what the hell this movie is not a family movie.. do you know what we will answer to small kids watching movie with us...you should even tell the theme of movie... otherwise movie had deep meaning but uh should care its impact on small kid they will be misguided thinking it as a western fashion...

I just can say... Lanat hay tum par... Shame on you....

Question to people who watched this amazing heart touching movie:What was the name of the emotional background tone when Rajkumar Rao was speaking with his reel mother on the terrace?

Sonam ji, you act so poorly, you are acting better than you. Juhi_chawla had better acting than you in this type of side role.... 😵😵😵😵😵
Trash

Love is love😄

Happy to see such positivity and compassion in the commend section.

Even though I am a straight girl I still support the lgbt community, they deserve equal rights

What is the Censor Board?
THE WORLD HAS GONE BONKERS.

Wow I never thought such a movie would come out on Bollywood. I love this kind of cinema. So REAL.

I really hope India soon becomes more conservative and they comes to you homosexual because I cannot stand this.

Well its official India&#39;s fucked

Watched the movie I am so disapointed of all the elders and espcialy Anil Kapoor and ur daughter for promoting such disrepectful thing in the World Fear ur God he did not create lesbians nor Gay people create these things themselves may God protect us and our kids.....u shameless people I am so pissed I wasted my money

Finally on the right track thank you

I pray makers of ELKDTAL R Lynched!!!

Juhi does not look old enough to be sonams mum

I don&#39;t know to whom soman love

This rancid food is coming out, there is a bullet in everyone but it is necessary to give it.
I am indian and pansexual! Though pansexuality is one of the least known I am still impressed that the lesbian community is getting it&#39;s recognition. Maybe one lgbt will have a proper stand and voice in india. People will be more aware hopefully and not shut their ears to something they have not known of before and thus don&#39;t understand

how is this movie

she is playing a homosexual character right??

How is the ending of this movie?

Pagol
Anil Kapoor is doing such films of Pew Deser Ko Ab Yeh Filme Rahghate Anil Kapoor Ke Lehe Yeh Behe ​​Ko Ye Ke Khane Te So Set of the film.

Fucking amazing

I feel so happy to finally see the LGBTQ representation on Bollywood screen, I hope this initiative proves to be a great success and paves way for further awareness.Proud to be Indian.

Less likes than gully boy but still hope it will be an epic

Seeing movies like this one &amp; Kapoor And Sons breaking into mainstream media gives me so much hope for the future of LGBT+ people in desi countries. I can never come out to my parents, they will never accept me. But I hope movies like this open the eyes of other parents and make other kids’ coming out stories easier. 💛🌈

It is very easy for a girl to live in her own home, it is also for a boy, or this movie is bad in India, a huge number of gay or lesbian people are getting worse, as if girls are wearing clothes in the name of women empowerment, they are not self-made. Or you were lying naked, how did you just rape me, how did you save the innocent child, how did you hunt these naked girls, why did you do that, you also heard that you raised your finger on me, I know you have given this answer to me in advance. You have always been alive in India, but after rape, I have increased because of the fear of seeing your body, you have become a ghost, you have become a ghost, neither have you married nor have you met any girl. Because of no one's reason or whatever, you got so angry that you threw your body in front of the wild animal, you saved yourself from the poor innocent people, because you did not even think about them, you became an additional victim. Jo chez pehle screen pr jate jate tharki log ab wo her gali muhulley mei jaga jaga dikhe gi tu rape mei tu izzfa hoga na bhai pakistan mei kyun ni hote es he wja se ni hote k jitna marzi modern dunya hojaye yaha ka culture aj That's why I feel like my daughter, my mother, my sister, there is no voice that I can give to any girl or that girl calls me like a boy, there is a big difference between me and Indian girls. just write the truth that your heart desires
Sai koi chootia writer hy es movie ka qudrat k khilaf likha hy es nay. Or salay log phir bhe pasand kr rahay hain shame on your thinking. Most ignorant people who think this is right

Finally Bollywood has something for the LGBTQ 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈I think this is gonna be this years best movie ever

This is amazing Kudos to Bollywood, Loved the movie 🍿

Manikarnika <a href="">
OMG YES I STAN 💜
Nice trailer

Watch an evening shadows for gay movie

Everyone makes movies on gays and lesbians but no one makes movies on gays...that's wrong.
What is rajkumar Rao&#39;s role if it is a lesbian love story?

Is there any original song?
go go goooo im crying i love dis
Stop calling God&#39;s name in this abomination

I am really overwhelmed and super excited on hearing that Bollywood has a whole different romance to share on screen with us. Girl love. Gosh they have done away with old age boy-girl thing. I hope it will help people umderstand the concept of lesbianism better. People will definitely talk about it openly which gives it a high way to go.

Bollywood Again Promoting Misconceptions &amp; Corruption into the society And as always People Swallowing sparkle wrapped shit like its new ice cream in the market.  Wait till they soon start to promotes Pedophilia &amp; Necrophilia as Next Modern &amp; Romantic thing into the Society. Just Pathetic! Save Your self &amp; your kids. Dont Fall for these emotional melo drama. No one is gay or straight or bi from birth, it is a cultural thing that person&#39;s biology accepts as conditioned which (the sexual orientation) then respectively become natural to the person.Support LBGT Community &amp; it&#39;s human rights but dont Support normalizing &amp; glorifying it. Once corruption is done it cant be undone.Wake up ! Corruption of your kids is on its way. Stay Alert or live the consequence! Reject The Bollywood Garbage!

Rajkumar Rao kinda reminds me of Ross Geller 😂

I&#39;m ao happy to know that India is doing this kind of movie, because it will help a lot to make the society to understand and accept this.

I&#39;m Big fan of Raj Kumar rao

Isse bhi Mann na maane to american series Dekho jisme girls-girls and boys-boys aapas m hi sex karte h. Waise hi sab log ban jaao.

Yeh koi Pehli film Nahi h about Lesbian aur Dostana bhi koi pehla film Nahi that about Gay. Fire-1996, Bombay Boys-1998, Girlfriend-2004, I am-2011, Honeymoon Travels-2007, Fashion-2008, Bombay Talkies-2013 etc.

Title should be-Ek Ladki ko dekhi to aisi lagi. The concept of Street-Man, Man-Woman, Boy-Girl has been abolished.
From now on flats will be named like this-Mrs. ABC &amp; Mrs. DEF (Lesbian/Gay Married Couple)Mr. ABC &amp; Mr. DEF (Gay/Lesbian Married Couple)And believe me all of you, this San dikhava h. A video came in which the lifestyle of lesbian and gay couples was shown and it was told that there is no specialty in this lifestyle. Therefore, ever think carefully about where the youth is going, has gone and will go.
All these things have an impact on the minds of even normal boys and girls. Speaking to the next generation - Looked at a girl and felt like this &amp; KJO's friendly show. Bollywood is destroying the country's old Sanskrit language for money/fame. Samajhne h to samjho.
Dhajjiya has been falling on Dhajjiya. And this is the story of LGBTQ rights. From now on it seems that opposite sex will be seen in marriage and the flower of love will bloom in same sex.
Yeh aaj k date m log apne life m opposite gender se bore hote has rahe h iske liye same gender m sex/love develop karna chslu Kar Raha Hain. Bollywood women empowerment k naam par Veere Di wedding m nangaapan ka rights dikhata h. Ab lesbian/gay sex Ka rights dikhata h. Bollywood is ruining the entire country with these type of bogus movies.

I love anil kapoor

The girl sonam loves is in yellow dress at <a href="">1:27</a>

This has to be directed or produced or some part played by karan johar..as he is the first one to introduce all this in bollywood

On the path of true love, what happens when someone tells someone else...if he doesn't fall in the love story then what will happen... 💘💘rajkummar best actor
This title goes for sonam; cause she might be playing role of lesbian in this movie and this is the truth of <a href="">2:11</a>

Nice

I am glad that movies are portraying LGBT love.

Looking at the comments, you get the feeling there are so many of the LGBT community living in hiding in the society you live, the city or village you live in. Makes me nervous. It is a scary world up ahead.

It is a mind shattering movie just loved it aamazing

Very nice movie..sensitive topic handle without making fun or puting sex scene

As a transgender I&#39;m so happy for such a film to come

About time Bollywood made a movie for our Gando girls. Well done!! Really inspiring for our future generations. Keep up the good in messing up there heads.

I hate this movie

In My whole like this is  very very bad bad bad movie

This movie dubbed Tamil pls

Nice bhai ye to Mera labh story hi

There is no such thing naturally created as homosexuality . It is altogether against natural laws not against society . An utterly stupid misconception . One may like a girlfriend or a boyfriend but it does not mean that the person is sexually attracted to that individual. Only a modern sickness going around. A disease without a cure unless it is considered a disease.

Sooo amazing....hope the thinking of the people of our country gets changed....
One of the pathetic movie of 2019

LGBTQ supportersLike if you support!!!
So nice movie 👌👌
The wheat
The Positivity in the comments is really just so refreshing  to see!Glad to read the excitement and overall happiness ....☺The Flim is very nice...I saw the movie tomorrow ....I think this movie is among the best movies on Bollywood. ..<a href="">#Setlovefree</a>❤

You have to waste your money or time by watching movies, you can also make some money out of them.
Supper

A good start for lgbt...hope they get their acceptance soon by society

Who wants to watched the full movie?

21M views yeah!

The time has been set to change the hetroenormative stories of the movie industry which postulates norms and sensibilities to a greater population, with such Stories. Hope all the regional movie industries have something to offer too to percolate acceptance and inclusion.

finally some good amount of diversity India.They should  definitely make another movie like Call me by your name

O my freaking GoshhhhhhGotta watch thisMay this movie go blockbuster hit....🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈

Mst

I moved to another country due to the same fear. Seeing this, where people of the LGBTQ community are not being ridiculed, instead a slice of their journey is shared, gives me some hope in the Bollywood industry which otherwise is fearfully homophobic.

💡💡<a href="">👍👍</a>
the film truly adresses the LGBTQ cause... hopefully its not releasing here but i will watch it really... set love free

greattt movie
I have a request to all the people who have seen this movie that they should not follow what has been shown in it, it is a very sad story, one thing has come to the society that they should give a little more money to the film line people. Will people be ready to do anything or there is a problem, I have found a better actor than Rajkumar Rao, please do not work in such poor movies from now on, everyone else is a bastard.
saw this movie in theatre and in ever scene , i just wanted one thing .   REFUND

This is the first time in watching the trailer and I got a hint of what the movie is but as the trailer ended I scrolled down to verify and it turned out what I expectedEdit:I have no problem with it though I&#39;m open abt every person the way they are😁

Unexpected movie one of the best movie of this yrs. 👍😃

It&#39;s sad that the trailer has achieved so much appreciation yet people don&#39;t go to the film.....the movie deserves a lot more love than it is recieving right now

totally worst movie

how is the picture

Hii

Sonam kapoor single handed ruined the movie. Felt bad for the rest of cast

This movie must be watched free of cost in Set Max......not a single penny more than this.

And... Here co s one more movie where Rajkummar didn&#39;t get married.😂😂😂 anyways great story😍 finally Indian cinema is changing positively😊

Loved the movie ...  Great story ... And a strong msg ... Loved Sonam and Anil sir 😍😍

Baby Sara has grown up

Love wins always ❤️🙌🏼
astagfirullah...signs of doomsday...this is the talk of final shame.
The level of virtue signaling is unbearable. The only reason gay marriage has been legalized in India is because the country has been practicing female infanticide for several decades which has led to almost a 300 million fewer women than men. Otherwise the government can&#39;t even stand pornography.

Nothing is relieving than to know people are getting aware to acknowledge the existence of same sex relation. When i came out to my parents last year, their first question was &quot;have you seen anyone like this&quot; which was right because there was never an Indian example to show them. But now I have. Even if they close their eyes or cover their eyes, bollywood plays a big role in Indian society. For the first time, the effort is marvelous. I hope next movies are more open, sensitive and redirect towards positive reality.Thanks Gazal Dhaliwal for writing and Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Shelly Chopra Dhar for producing and directing!Being a closeted lesbian, I felt like sweety for many years of my life so I can relate (yeah! Not the sacrifice and the compromise part! 😊)

What is the concept of movie...Illuminate people are the type of movies they are making...India is being ruined...Don't realize that you will come together with India people... ....who knows what has been illuminated on the net by searching for it...or singing a song in the name of sun, it has been mentioned in us that
Lesbo love💓 too bad
Itni Urdu to mujhay bhi nahee aati. and I&#39;m from Pakistan. ❤️️

Feeling v sad for Indians. What happened to them now they will show positive reactions to such stories

I love you mahi very much mis you always
Good movie

At first I thought &quot;oh great! Another rom-com!&quot; But by the end of the trailer, I was impatient to see this. Oh my god, it&#39;s so good to see a story with a lead character being from the LGBT community.

🤐😵If a human's mind is moving in the right direction, he will not support homosexuality. If you think that homosexual culture is good for the human world, then why don't everyone absorb this culture? But it does not happen like this, because if one person is fool then everyone should not be fooled right. 😒 Movie on LGBTQAI has been made in India, it is a matter of shame for us, that too... There are actors like Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. ...🤔 Disgusting😠 Bollywood is going in wrong direction....🚫🚷🤼
What is the meaning of LGBTQ?

Live your life irrespective of perspective

LESBO flick- finally at thy service... Loving someone is not an issue, but who to love IS ? Well, this could be contributive in lessening the population of India, somehow... When can we expect to see gay guys from the mainstream cinema? Shah Rukh Khan and Salman&#39;s movie might be as rumors are in the air by BHANSALI&#39;s production house... Fingers crossed...

Nc

I am in relation where she’s 12 years older thn me. And I can’t tell my parents. We both are in true love and we both want to be married eith each other. How to convince parents and What to do?

Such a beautiful story

Aj ye flim dekhunga

Good

guyz star to follow juhi chawla in instagram

Love in the air ....such a grt concept and also a watchable movie 🍿

Mst

The girl saw a girl and the girl fell in love with the girl...a bad film.
Its amazing movie. People are saying that Sonam Kapoor looks lame in this movie. I don&#39;t agree because the character of Sweetie represents the lady who has suppressed her feelings so she is fully playing her role. Its amazing one. Set Love Free. Thank you for the great movie. Love and respect from Nepal.

Beautiful

So sad to hear it won’t be releasing in certain countries.Unfortunately including mine—Pakistan. 😭I rlly wanted to watch this. I’m rlly happy these people are working to use the power of media to influence people, and change their medieval mindsets.

Riteish Deshmukh's &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji&quot; Have you seen the real look in the movie?




look at all the comments people think it&#39;s a positive movie that&#39;s the reason so many broken families in India just look at the ratio and people r sleeping that&#39;s how slow poison of media works that u forgot what&#39;s right and wrong just look at the condition of Americans Europeans all broken families next it is india dont worry people sleep and enjoy illuminati and free masons bullshit

a family spoiler movie its  brain washing machine but people of india r totally in the hands of illuminati they think it&#39;s very modern that a woman can stay with woman and a man with man what a ghatiya thinking they r injecting your brains with illuminati poison

Nice..anil kapoor n juhi chalwa are awesome..juhi after long time❤❤..sonam n rajkumarr❤❤
LOVE IS LOVE

Shame on makers n anil kapoor. What message are they giving that its good be LGBT .

About time it was made like a mainstream movie. Go India. That&#39;s progress.

Yey to lesbian ha 😂
Awesome movie I loved it you should watch it

All ppls who is supporting this shit i think u got paid well long positive comments.

every single gay person is here to support this agenda ..so a game is guys some dumb ppls are trying to legalize LGBTQ in Asia. And the best way is to make a bollywood movie ...trust me no hatred from my side but u all need to concern a doctor or physiologist and they will let u know in a better way that this bullshit can cause more damage to human brain then a nuclear bomb.....men are men and women are women we all believe in God so even for a SEC can u think that the God was mistaken while he made women for men and men for women...its all about the belief. thats it u have a wonderful day      .

Love anil kapoor😍

Tamil lum dubbed panuga da...
If such kind of thinks is going to be happen I think this will be the end of the world woman+woman=no humans and Same thing will occur for man+man=no human and later on different kind of diseases will appear so people who are supporting it I think are senseless so shame on them

Shame on you anil Kapoor, money is not everything, you people sold your soul, you people are destroying the culture of india, shame on you,

This world is becoming like hell.....go towards spirituality and intelligence people...instead of towards materialism....all these joys are temporary...it is just foreign agenda to manipulate our youth and control population.....these people are nothing from inside.

Super

I things wonderful movie...

Watched movie without watching the trailer. While watching it felt like some regular shit movie until interval. The second half is such a promising and revolutionary in Bollywood. Good job.

Today I saw this movie and it&#39;s actually a great story and most important kind of true story even though the law has given the permission but the thinking has not changed yet at all over all I think it&#39;s the best movie of 2019 really loved it...

twist: she is lesbian...

Lesbian movie and now Bollywood  is totally doing the job brain washing

Director Shelly Chopra Dhar makes a breezy first half that takes the best of a Wodehouse story and comes up with a sunny, happy entertainer. It&#39;s when she takes on societal prejudices and throwing light on a couple but continues to take the pre-interval approach that the cracks in her missus begin to show. And even though her lead actress does a sincere—but skimming the character&#39;s surface—job, it&#39;s the rest of the cast that shines and props up the movie all through. Meanwhile offscreen, the movie&#39;s producer continues to don the mantle of a life and music coach. Read complete review here: <a href="">

Dear Indian , Kindly save your self, and your values....Dont appreciate Subject against Nature Phenomenon

These Bollywood industrial businessmen. Thier God is Money and Alominati agenda. Anil&#39;s Sonam get married to a Man. But teaching other  bisexual .. all this agenda for poors and middle class peoples. .

Lanat han es movie p or es ke pasand karne walo p.

Lesbian movie hai bhai
What kind of ass loving story is this, friend??!!
Aj kal kya kya flim ata hai...its about lesbian....chiiii

Why to create and promote movies which are against the ‘law of nature’???? This is goin’o lead  to total destruction

Lesbian story, which is the enemy of Hindu society, the enemy of our nature, damn it
How cheap they all belong to Illuminati and promoting Vulgarity everywhere people need to understand this ALLAH created us in pairs Man and Woman not man for man and woman for woman this is cheapness at it&#39;s peak should stop this Yahood are the main reason behind this

I woke up at 1:30am earlier browsing social media sites and see this movie and me be like wow I think this is the reason why I woke up at the middle of the night 😍 Applause applause for the movie 😍😍

OMGFINALLY I AM GOONG TO CRY

Brilliant movie the only thing wrong was that the entire Love relationship that is shown in the movie is not even 10 mins



Nyc. Moviee

So who is she in love with? No other woman really shown in this trailer

castim and religion wali love story se bollywood pak gya, ab ye le aaye. theek h but content naam ki bhi cheez hoti h.

Of course they chose the family to be a Muslim one. There would have been riots had they made it a Hindu family.

Destroying scocity  .  .   .

India is being westernize

<a href="">#extraordinary</a> 🔥
Sach kahoon to LGBT community pe is movie ko bad comments isliye ni mile kyuki it talked about lesbian (girl) relationship. Agar gay (boy) relationship ke baari Mai hoti na to logon ka perspective alag hotaSad Hypocrisy 😶

Worst movie in the world

Oppo f9 pro is the best phone

<a href="">2:22</a> here you go 😍

I can&#39;t wait to watch!! Kudos to all the people who&#39;s behind this movie!! You&#39;re giving as a great movie as we enter 2019!! 😍😍

woaahh something new to the eyes for a Bollywood movie 😍 See this people having positive comments is a WOW 😍 c&#39;mon people its 2019 appreciate these kind of movie, <a href="">#Bollywood</a> <a href="">#LGBTQ</a> 🙂

I don&#39;t support this movie . Yar kya Bana rahe ye log

LGBT culture is not good for human being... This is disgusting....😒😡😷

Its a big initiative .......kudos for that 🤞...but i think people will now judge girls with other angle ...it would be more difficult for normal girls to prove themselves normal..............<a href="">#justmythoughts</a>

I can&#39;t believe that this is pretty much the first mainstream Bollywood lgbtq+ based movie and I can&#39;t go watch it... I&#39;ll be sure to watch it as soon as I can, of course but as a lesbian myself, I feel really bad that I won&#39;t be able to watch it in the theatre. Anyways, lots of respect to Sonam Kapoor for having the courage to play this character and to the writers, director and producer for finally making this happen.

Simplistically Beautiful Film..... Loved it.....🤗🤗🤗
Sala south film super khiladi 3 se same
Ok another love story ! Why all films are love stories

Pole twist: sonum is married

with all due respect,these relationship with same gender could work in high society or metro cities but indian society as a whole will never accept it! i was speaking to my wife about lesbians and its still a very big tabbo because many women and men in india cannot even digest the concept that same gender people can be in love

Today I have learned a lot from the theater.
The boys who watch this movie are still gay or are they gay again?
This very nice movie trailer  .l want  to go chenema hall watching this movie

Super

Superb

Hum jaise logo ko iss movie ke through samajha ja sakta hai

Where is Regina Cassandra ?

Content looks kick ass but execution is the main suspense . Whether it pans out traditional bolly type or like the new bolly which is really exciting  .

why bollywood now a days always roaming around lgbt movies?...Why not taking any socially relevant  subjects other than this...please do inspire from south indian movies...which always carries a socially relevant message which are related to poverty, farmers&#39; plight, dirty business of education institutions, dirty political games, against women rape etc...thtz why most of the people like south movies...bollywood always concentrated on love movies or these kinds of gay movies...no varieties..plz do change👍👍👍👍...

Eee......No worth watching it

It&#39;s a lesbian love story
Why we supporting <a href="">this.ye</a> ek bimari h jiska ilaz ho sakta h. Koi future nhi h sath hi sath medical rog jo hote h vo alg se. Agar aaj ki generation esi movie dekhegi to unhe to ye shi lgega na. Hmare culture me iski koi manyta nhi h. We should not approciate this and we should denied it.

Release hogai kia ye movie ...im dying to see this couple in a romantice love story 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Sad to see that day 1 collection was 3.30cr...c&#39;mon audience this is what cinema should be...

Just saw the movie.. The movie brilliantly showcased the struggle such people go right from childhood... The movie doesn&#39;t hurts the sentiments of the community.. And there&#39;s where the movie wins...

Ciyapa lesbians  😂
Life of LGBt people z so difficult ..they r never accepted by society or sometimes their own parents .they harbor their pain nd admiration nd also never be able to explore yourself bcoz this society treats them like a prostitute but after reading people&#39;s comments m very Happy ..that there&#39;s a change in people&#39;s now

Couldn't find a worse story than this. You make people say anything out of spite. You even think about it. May God always do bad to you.
Damn it the trailer alone made me cry! Can’t wait to watch the movie!

I don&#39;t understand how the world thinks homosexually is normal. Suddenly. Even though are bodies aren&#39;t designed for it yet we all make it so common. The world is actually becoming uneducated and regressive by going against nature. Seriously sad.

Pure kanjar haramzaday
So this trailer has had me confused.... Does she like girls?

Beautiful movie

Mst

Beautiful

Woww 😮  a nice bollywood movie after so long time

I can totally understand..

Juhi ♥️♥️
Sonam loves....who???? Did anyone saw the film...please answer this....???

Here's a lesson for you 🤔
Rajkumar 👌 👌 👌.
Nice

BIG FAN of Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla and of course Rajkummar Rao. Sonam Kapoor is also doing some acting.. Must watch this movie for the performances.. But the topic? Shitty!! Humanity has not been broken, why is this society like this? By promoting homosexuality, we are not modern, we are getting destroyed.. The East is not in need of adopting the poor culture of the West.. How much harm is being done to the lives of the young and upcoming generation. Asar parega, it is necessary to think.. Just think!!! PLEASE... Haath jorrta hoon..
This is a shameful story, this is a story to expose the traditions of India, the app is making fun of the word 'Hooshaddi' which is spoiling the minds of the people, you are talking about enjoying the pleasure of the body, are you a boy or a girl? If you do not want to live with a girl, then you will not want to live, brother, if you get happiness from someone of the same sex, then what is the use of marrying someone, in which way you get happiness, that is how I get happiness in eating by stealing, so what is the song of stealing in the book? Then I said, this is my right, brother, these are the things whose life does not stop, they have to do things for the sake of the society, this is not a film which will spoil everyone, it is like a drug addict thinking that why should he become like me, he is right, he is the boss. The game of logos is ruining everyone's mind with bools, this book is libral sonam, swara ye log.
Xxx

Don&#39;t watch this  movie  worst of money 😝😝😝

Speaking only English, I hope there is an English translation as it looks a fabulous movie.

Wake up people don&#39;t encourage such things God started the world with Adam and Eve not eve and eav or Adam and Adam otherwise the world would have ended as it started Bollywood should not put this rubbish in new generation heads its wrong.

@ <a href="">2:12</a> the most iconic scene in the trailer.  Slowly but gradually India is coming out of its shell. <a href="">#LetLoveBe</a> 🇲🇺

I hate how they gave it all away in the trailer itself. Losers.

Astaghfirullah
Shame on LGBTQ...
Spreading homosexuality in society

Chhhheeeeeeeeee........thhhooooo......... Kalyug..!  Such sinful feelings are not accepted in any religion. Stop making such movies and Stop promoting such a sinful feeling. Same gender attraction is a mental sickness, use your brain people.

LGBTQ= lesbian,gay,transgender, bisexual, ......Q=???????
Kudos to sonam and team for the brave effort. Amazing!!! Expecting Lot of positivity in the society regarding this movie.

Such a brave step by a Bollywood movie!! <a href="">#section</a> 377

This is true democracy!!!

Lesson to be learnt: Never go to a first showing of any film without seeing an unbiased critical review. I learnt my lesson today by seeing this picture in London on its first showing. What can I say, the picture is imbecilic to say the least. The plot beggars belief and the acting is below par. And why do they have to have a Mohammedan in every film. In this film there was absolutely no need. It could have &#39;worked&#39; without the Mohammedan character. The killer blow is when the film makers try to send out the message that being a lesbian is okay. As a Conservative I am opposed to this &#39;normalisation&#39; of sexuality generally in society. I sympathise with people with this affliction but it is no way &#39;normal&#39; and should not be portrayed as such. When I had seen the trailor, I had remarked that this is nithing but &#39;Anil Kapoor family home movie&#39;. In reality it turned out to be a very boring and morally bankrupt script and the overall feeling of nausea still lingers in the mouth. After the movie, my wife commented that it would have been better to see URI for the 3rd time instead. My rating: 0 *

I am so happy that bollywood is finally opeing up to such genres and this comment section restores my faith in humanity

When I saw a girl I felt like this &gt; <a href=""> Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga &gt; <a href=""> Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga &gt; <a href="">
We are going towards wrong

Something new wow appreciate it

guys if ur true indian watch this full video please.   <a href="">

Watched Ek Ladki...on the first day of its release today. So relieved and happy that same-sex love is being portrayed in mainstream cinema now.  Hope times are changing.... Thank you to the Ek Ladki film team, cast, producers, everybody who are willing to speak about sensitive topics. Would have loved to see more of Sweety-Kuhu (Sonam-Regina) romance, and more nuances, but a commendable effort in the right direction, nonetheless. Kudos !

“Ughhhhh... touch me Jamal”

Love u juhi chawla..  .😍😍😍😍😍
He&#39;s a lesbian in a movie

wow I wasn&#39;t expecting so many positive comments, reallyreally glad to see the changing atmosphere in our country<a href="">#LGBTQ</a>+RIGHTS

I wont watch it just bcz of karan jo and everyone standing against manikarnika...... Thumbs down.... I dont have any issue with LGBTQ...

Going through the comments section just noticed that there are more lesbians then gay people who are happy for their representation. And also, some straight girls will get the feeling that they belong to LGBTQ community and experiment things. I said girls because, it is very much acceptable when girls hold hands of each other and it would not be much difficult for them to experiment with mutual decision. Am not against it just keeping my views on.

Who is the second lady...today on the radio also there are 4 ladies who are talking all the time...
And LGBT people, show that you are giving birth to a child from your ass...Saalo ass marna...It seems like they are separating you a bit...
That's a very sad love story...
When it comes to love stories ..difficult part is facing cast problems  ..n love bw 2 females n males too...

Wait!!! Wasn&#39;t Dostana first LGBT movie???
Sonam has always been different by her unique choices of movies. And she has proved it again.Seeing prime time actors in a lgbtq mainstream movie, and people supporting it makes me love india much more

Rajkumar rao is love wo dialogue ..!!!
Great to see a Bollywood movie with a gay love story. Hope it does well!

<a href="">2:18</a>-<a href="">2:26</a> 💕💕💕💕 Truu Dat!
And a nice movie too and I like the whole movie a lot.Ye alag baat h ke agar Mai details batau to I&#39;ll say ke this could be more mazedar and inspirational along with a game changer

So finally Bollywood came with the topic without any hesitation, objections and with a mainstream cast n crews. Salute to the struggles as the society is changing thoda sa hi sahi. Because I know the battle is still going on. It happens always ke when the discussion is about others then we say ke they should be together or the guardian and elders should understand and blah blah blah... But jab khud pe aati hai to these thoughts just fades away. And we also become pyar ke dushman.. log Kya kahenge, relatives mazak udaenge and blah blah blah

I dont know about hotness ,sex appeal or acting but sonam kapoor has the most beautiful face in bollywood after aishwarya and katrina. Given the fact that if she becomes diplomatic like the rest of the actresses m sure she will recive love from all corners. But the sad part is people only wants perfection n bash her left right n centre! Just want to remind u all that it takes a lot to b true n real being a celeb. Hats off to sonam for keeping it real n not caring much about the trolls coming her way .

love this sooooo much😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awww ye to lgbt ki L wali story hai but cute si lag rhi

Life is too short to hate its better to live, love and enjoy n accept by Wat ur and who u r....

Biswa laxmi debbarma
sonam lesbian hogi is film me shyd
O my God my India has filled with unnatural human beings 😔😔😔

Wait, when a guy and go on a date, it is almost always the guy who pays the bill.So, if Sonam and her girlfriend go on a date, who pays the bill?

Good

Nice

She is lesbian

A

prince is my favorite hero
Nice

wondering why regina&#39;s name or character not mentioned in description or in interviews.. is that also a secret?

Honestly, I&#39;m so happy for Bollywood. Bravo 👏👏👏 <a href="">#LoveIsLove</a>

Amazing
How did the girl feel after seeing a boy...Brother...😀😀
Nice to see

Song&#39;s grate...

I am straight Indian but massive respect for LGBTQ community. High expectations from this film, really looking forward to it.

as an Indian bisexual and someone who is in love with a girl being a girl myself, I am proud of what Bollywood is doing. Thank you for this

Super fkop

the song is very good but sonam kapur is a very bad actor
So excited for this!!!

<a href="">

I am literally smiling like an idiot after going through the comment section. Thankyou guys for the support. You don&#39;t know the feeling of relief when an Indian brother or sister supports you if you belong to the lgbtqai community

The real question is who is the lucky girl Sonam fell in love with

Hats off to all the actors and the whole staff of this movie to make such a movie. It takes courage especially in a conservative country like ours. Hope things will take a little bit  turn after this movie and make our country, open minded.

Uff India me itny lesbian or gay Han????

Set love free? Promising. Just hoping this won&#39;t spoil the remembrance of that sublimely beautiful 2017 movie &quot;Call me by your name&quot; - Love is love is love...Elio and Oliver are forever painfully etched in memory.

I don&#39;t understand the story, and WHAT secret is she hiding?..can anyone tell me plz😥

Hope..this movie changes perception of people..towards..LGBT.. 👍

Regina Cassandra is playing sonam&#39;s lover role...❤️

This movie is a breath of fresh air 💓 Honestly, these are the stories that need to be told. I had lost hope for Bollywood, but it might be all lost if they stimulate the society into a progressive way of thinking.

Message if any girl wants to connect 😊

<a href="">1:23</a>

Story of lesbian...😉

Shameless living, Bollywood has now shown the evil beyond its limit, I have shown evil emotionally without saying anything, this is Bollywood, you have been playing tricks with my true nature...Daro from the time when it rains from the sky. गा or sub mit jayega.....!!!!!!!
lets go lesbians!

Rajkumar's sth bara siyapaaa. Pehly buthni ab lesbian hahahah
most people haven&#39;t understood what the movie is about and its message .... 😂😂   ....

time waste

Anyone from Moga?

Listen Audio Version of this song Here:

Don&#39;t support this

Awesome! Looking forward to this movie!!

true love??? Where are you?
Sonam plz stop doing acting..I blame sanjay lila fr ds.
Sonam and Regina. Can&#39;t wait to watch.

She&#39;s playing lesbian (<a href="">1:28</a>) 2 girls get separated. Its not shameful but sometimes it is a very awkward feeling

After watching this trailer, i am truly understanding the mechanism of movie making and stardom. The formula to make ANY idea normal and even POPULAR. To non-thinking youth. The way this movie making, the straight people who are commenting here, feel gay. Like toxic in our food and pollution in the air, media is influencing minds of teens and youth. They are vulnerable. Striving to make a mark for themselves. I hope they will understand movie making is a BUSINESS. Then need CUSTOMER.Don’t become Zombies

Love u guys you are the best Sonam and rajkumar combo who could have thought salute to the director and actors for choosing such a bold topic and looking forward for the movie and more such movies sorry werote a little too much but was not able to control my emotions

Now the title makes sense it’s not just named after the song

Dammn wth..I&#39;m waiting

What is siyappa 🤔😇

From the 1996 movie fire to this film, our audience has come a long way, kudos💃🌠😁

Anil kapoor is best
Oh jab section 377 ka scene chal raha tha tab I just wished k ispe movie bana chahiye n I just expressed this feeling on a post of Instagram as a comment on it and now it actually became true; thank you so much to grant my wish❤️👌🤗

Finally an indian movie about LGBTQ. A refreshing change.

Nice concept

Kudos to the Indian film makers....they are exploring new and bold concepts and themes...It&#39;s high time the society understands and starts to accept the LGBT community...

I&#39;m an Indian bi teen, seeing this, and scrolling through the comments increases my hopes I have for my country.. When I knew my preferences I was scared.. I still am. Because every good side has a bad side.. But, at least we&#39;re heading somewhere good and that alone makes me happy :)

what i liked was there was no stereotypical characterization

hindu muslim pe film hai pagal mat banooo salo sudar jaooo
pure unnatural   topic  hate this topic  this could be better  and natural

seriously all my   expectations regarding this movies comes to an end and feel so hurt by this topic

Wow looks amazing!

isme ek suhag raat ka scine hona chahiye tha hero or heroine k bich thoda sa

Love Jihad film is being brought to ruin the country. Boycott this film.
Bakvas film love jihad
Where&#39;s the lgbtq reference in this movie? Maybe I missed ? 🤔

My Islam does not allow its creation, and there is no one other than Islam.
We don&#39;t have to be LGBTQ to campaign for LGBTQ Rights. Human Rights are for everyone, no matter who you are or whom you love. So it&#39;s a request to all my dear country people, please support the movement, their lives also matter. And thanks to the entire team of ELKDTAL for trying a new theme which is very important in the contemporary society. I wish you all good luck and grand success for the movie. 👍

<a href="">2:20</a> its a lesbian <a href="">story.It</a> shows that

Wow....this was needed 😍

Backwas

I&#39;m a bisexual women and this gave me a hope that things will be better in future and I can explore the other side of my sexuality. I could relate to this and made me sad that things could have been easier if I wasn&#39;t from this country. Hope things will be better for LGBT in future

Sonam in the movie is lesbien 🤔🤔🤔😏😏😏

Yaar pta nhi tha comment section me itne saare lesbian or gay milenge. By the way congrats to all of u to accept what u r

Finally!! Daughter&#39;s and father&#39;s movie together

Best of luck to all of u

How poor actress sonam is...nepotism product.  Not stand with kangna at all...

I just love the concept of the film.

shit i cant wait to watch it

so glad to see all these positive comments here..the trailer gave me chills and as a huge lgbtq supporter i love how india is finally growing...if love simon made me cry hell id be sobbing the whole time in this movie

NYC movie

It would have been better to have created peace in our society. lovejihad not good
Bhenchod kuch bhi films hain made..
I m just excited to watch sonam make out with another chick

I don't like LGBT. Sab pagal ho gye hai... it's weird.
Wooow I luv Raj Kummar, but I&#39;m so impressed with Sonam, she&#39;s a great actress nd looks stunning. ..many actresses would be afraid to do these kinf of movies.. .definitely gonna be a hit movie

Yeh log aisi movie kyun nahi bante hai jisme ek muslim ladki hindu ladke se shadi kare? Kab hoga aisa, are they targetting hindus to convert to Islam, If so, then tumhari maa ka bhosda

<b><i>Powerful social message❤</i></b>
My question is for lesbian girls ...IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN MALE PARTNER FOR UR SEXUAL AND MENTAL DESIRES.??I FEEL BAD BCZ U GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT WHY NOT FOR MALE??PLZ ANS ME IF UR LESBIANS..AND READING IT...THNX..Its me ....UR BUDY

Oh super hit hoyagi

Mera desh badal rha hai Happy to see it

Smjha he nai trailer???😅😅😅😅

I&#39;m proud that Indians r taking this story positively 😊😊

i have made a short film on LGBT community recently. I have been working for this cause since a long time and never got anybody&#39;s support. I am so happy that his film is releasing 💜

I&#39;m coming out soon Maa and Deota 😘

The country is changing, you are also changing your thinking.
This is what we call moderanism. Shame for making such a movie. You represent the bad side of peoples in a good way and now wants the society to think of it. India is now changing and this change is harmful. Don&#39;t play with the nature

It really felt like you saw a girl.
The story of India ek father rejected groom like thisRject Muslim for religion Ask for Hindu boyThen he reject Hindu  for castNow he got a Hindu boy for his cast still he reject Status wiseAnd finally  for gay

as an Indian. I&#39;m proud. I hope this movie makes a lil difference. btw hello fellow Army 😏

Too good😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

Ye kehn kisi lesbo ki story to nai....

<b>This movie should be banned</b> 😠😠😠
Wow !! New kind of story, will surely encourage this one

Agge bhi toh bolo First time mein Anil Kapoor old lag rahe hain ... par Aur Handsome lag rahe hain ...  :) Love you Anil Phaaji !

Love jihad movie ...FYI1. Aamir Khan married more than one Hindu girl not a Muslim girl KEPTthe child name name as Muslim2. Saif Ali Khan married Hindu women more than once and left the child name name as Muslim

This is the nuisance that Muslims are creating marrying a Hindu woman and then leaving it away just to create another MuslimAamir Khan married more than one Hindu girl not a Muslim girl second example Saif Ali Khan married Hindu women more than once and left the child name name as Muslim

I love Rajkumar Rao my favourite hero
anil kapoor sir&#39;s laugh at <a href="">1:23</a>

Nice

Wow salute the director of this film

Bollywood is again bringing a movie in which it is adding this dialogue "Hindu girl should marry a Muslim". Like Amir Khan, Shahrukh Khan did
