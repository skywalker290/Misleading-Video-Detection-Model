My favourite song 
Anyone listening to this song in August 2023  ?

Ahh..Why is this song sooo good 

Abhay deol is so underrated, even the video title doesnt include him... :(

This song is truly a mind refresh one...!!

Every group of 3 friends tries to find their character in this movie, based on the current reality of life. Like I&#39;m doing currently 

Going to Kerala India today from Stansted

Going to Kerala India tomorrow can&#39;t wait from stansted!! Via Dubai

Going to India Kerala day after tomorrow can&#39;t wait!!!

I am going to Spain tomorrow  for likes 

Year 2019: it was  Final year we all boys were planning a foreign trip To spain because in our group everyone loved this movie so much ... We thought of making it in 2020 But everyone know what happenedLater everyone were like let it be but but ...2022:  The spark was again there and we made it 7 boys ,10 days and memories  for lifetime  and we even  watch this movie again one night at the hotel ... Those laughs, those dinners all that moments all fresh in mind ..Its 2023 hopefully we will make another foreign trip probably soon  to Australia this time..

10 years and since this song buzzes through my head sometimes. It truely shows the true aspect of life .

Remember seeing it for the first time when I was 13-14 years old on its tv premiere , those were the good days

I can only sing.
Life transitions too soon from Farhan&#39;s way to Hrithik&#39;s way of living as you age!

In spain right now and listening to this on loop!

<a href="">1:40</a>

Its like motivation to me

After years of listening to this song and watching movie I&#39;ve decided to enjoy life more and be much cheerful person. Doing what i like (hobby) and of course who doesnt like to travel 

Remembering a trip that never happened 

I am in Germany and planning to go for a trip with friends.

Hritik&#39;s approach towards life is what reality is!!!!

My favorite song since my childhood

This is the song which inspired me to leave my job and go to Spain to enjoy La Tomatina (because my manager wasn’t approving my leaves lol). It all happened in 2016. The most memorable trip of my life with 2 other friends. The ZNMD trip of my life !! I’ll go again when I am old. There will be wrinkles on my face but I am sure my spirit will remain the same

This movie will not make any good

What a musical song

We want ZNMD2

Spain ja rhy hay hum.log
I play this song when i have to pack my bag for the trip, believe me its quiet efficient for packing purpose

Who I want to be when packing : HrithikWho I really am when packing : Farhaan

There is only one life just go for everything you can. ZMD ALL TIME BEST MOVIE ️

Why does this sound like “wake up sid” (some parts)

Who likes to go out with their friends  and if you are smart then comment if you are not smart then you will remain silent 
I have planned a trip to Spain in the year 2026 for my bachelorette with 2 of my friends, in the year which this movie will complete its 15 years. Oh,it would be so fun!

Listening this while traveling to airport to catch up an early morning flight (first flight tbh - solo). What a feel! :P

ZNMD and YJHD are emotions ️ Bollywood won&#39;t make this type of movies again.....

Aditya yogi n Draupadi murmu take away film making rights from Farhan Akhtar for another 100 year

I watched the ZNMD last night and it refreshed my mind ….in fact thinking the life of Katrina it’s pretty Kool Just live your life guys take a break and go somewhere unknown It’s so much fun to explore new things I m gonna do that have been to Spain before why not another trip We have only one life let’s live it CheersX

<a href="">3:24</a> was abhay deol’s real visa stamping

Such films should be made

Thank you Kavyashree Znmd my all time fav movie

Hope this song was a little longer than it is

The vibe of guitar bass and lead along with drum make this song beautiful loved it...

I think this movie should be made again set in according to 2020s era. This movie is from 2010 things had quiet change since then.

Finally I&#39;m in Spain. But the &#39;s&#39; is silent.

<a href="">0:39</a> this is the best part

Friends, if you get to travel throughout the world do travel. I have so far travelled to 21 international destinations. Travelling has helped me a lot in improving myself. It will also help you a lot. So don&#39;t miss an opportunity to travel.

Thank you so much for I could watch this film in a theatre in Japan. This is my memorial film which I watched in 2011 with my friend in India.(at home)She explained to me whole story because I could not understand Hindi at all.Lots of love from Japan.

Never 2 OLD

hurrah and happy hurrah to this song.

I like shankar mahadevan film song good much too and too lovely song too much on the stooty award on the ferrirchos smug on the mug .

This is not a movie this is just loveeee ️

Joi Barua 
This is best movie evergreen

Leaving this message today and will reply back to it once I go to spain 

This movie was totally incomplete without hrithik roshan️‍

&quot;Why not play a game in which someone wins&quot;
This songs is full of life.

Sibuoo come lets go on an adventure with Amit ,dancing away

Whatever Hrithik packed in his luggage was never wore by him in the entire movie

Only Legends know,taste of this music and the vibe..beautiful past memories 

This movie and song have definitely taught me to live my life to the fullest.

Hrithik&#39;s closet is more organized than my life .

I wish after some years I can also go to a trip like this with my friends.

Joy Barua is a gem 

I&#39;m just going to Canada after all listening to this most beautiful and inspiring song finally my dream came true

I&#39;ve watched the hug of these two old friends again and again

going to barcelona tomorrow so im listening to this song while packing

Favorite movie ️
Sometimes in my spare time i keep. Thinking kya karun Ab trip pr bhi nhi ja sakta pesa hi nhi haiThen I end up by going in khet &amp; sit alone in cool blowing winds 

Absolutely love this song

2022 anyone

Dil jese dhadke dhadkne do  it's fire 
gonna move to my own place today, luggage all around me, and this masterpiece in my mind

Nice

Travellers anthem!!!!

Even I also want to go spain

If we remove &quot;चलो ना(chalona) to &quot;Corona&quot; from &quot;Hey Hey चलो ना(chalona)&quot; WHOLE SONG IS CHANGED 
I wish I was born in spain 
Going to Barcelona for studies, after a vacation back home, this video is a vibe...

Delhi Capitals n Delhi CA are you ready.... The King is here.... 
Who belongs to Gen Z but still loves this movie ????

If a class 9th kid sees this movie he often gets motivated to study well &amp; live this kind of life.

Listening to this masterpiece in airport ️

 is
 Spain yeah
Watched the whole movie because of this one song

ZNMD will always be remain my one of the fav. Bolly film

finally in Spain  , mallorca  listening to this songgggg

Way way ahead of its time

Lovely song

:)

People like Hrithik will think 100 times before helping, are reserved kinda and people like Farhan are always ready to help anytime or any adventure or trip....

Zindagi na milegi dobara and yeh jawani hai deewani are my all time favorite Bollywood films

I went paris or las Vegas like this

Finally going on a Solo trip to Spain after watching this song and mesmerizing it sitting on the side window of the bus while returning from college ️

When the time comes, we will also go to Europe with Buddies.
I would say these three are the main hero of this movie  abheyFarhan Hrithik Roshan

Please release it once again in theaters

Energy next level
Here After Shobhit Bhaiya Video
It remember me toyoto ad

this song perfectly suits my prevailing situation. 

Hrithik- Another level

One of my favourite

Spain 🇪🇸
<a href="">1:40</a>

Love this song ️

Beautiful 
The song is shot so beautifully and accurately. Abhay being chauffeur driven to airport and travelling in 1st class. Hrithik packing perfectly everything and that too at night before sleeping, disciplined and focused like his character. He flies business and like a workaholic works on his laptop and at the end picks up a business magazine. Farhan packing at the last moment, forgetting his passport and then flirting with steward in flight, so like him (I mean character’s).Hats off to Zoya.

This song makes me wanna travel. Hit like if you listening in 2022.

I have not even seen anything but I wanted to find such a life partner who would accompany me on the journey of the world...
I&#39;ve been dreaming of going on big adventure someday and doing my best for it but whenever I loose confidence and think about giving up, this song keeps my dream alive 

Missing childhood days badly Many childhood memories with this Masterpiece song kaash woh din waps ate 2010 days

Legend movie 
Znmd is 

still listening to thiss

Great movie, don&#39;t mind watching it 100 times 

Lovely  song   
The personality and the demeanor of each of the three stand out in stark parallel to how they live and behave, and how they change at the end of the film.Arjun is disciplined, yet a workaholic who has trouble communicating his feelings and is not able to separate his personal and professional life. He loves to enjoy life but always lets his views on being successful and rich get in the way. Despite that, he gains a new lease on his life after he meets Laila, overcomes his fears, and finally finds her as a life partner. Imran is the polar opposite of Arjun, though doing decent, he&#39;s haphazard, wayward, flirty, and a womanizer, who gets on people&#39;s nerves. Yet his skill for poems is appreciated but he is not able to do anything regarding them, but he&#39;s a good friend who knows how to have fun, same as Kabir. After meeting his biological father, he realizes his mistakes and finally reconciles with Arjun, and starts a true relationship with Nuria.Kabir, ever the middleman and mediator of the group, is a combination of Arjun and Imran. Diligent and organized yet a complete prankster when needed, he nevertheless is caught in the middle between his and his girlfriend&#39;s families and is not able to juggle both, leading to him leaning on his friends for support. It takes a combination of his friends and his own efforts to finally tell Natasha that he can&#39;t marry her, and in the end, contrary to Arjun and Imran, who have found love, he finds happiness and independence. This movie is a fucking masterpiece.

We visited Spain in 2019 after years of loving this movie. We watched it again there in our hotel. I was crying of joy.

9ys already but this movie helps me a lot about friendship and hardship that we have to earn️

Are there some people that listen to this in 2022

Facing our fears is the ultimate love we can ever experience...handsdown znmd for life !

This song reminds me of how I should live my life. Running my own race, exploring myself, being different from the crowd, not caring about other&#39;s opinions of me, being truly happy in the moment. Javed Akhtar, you&#39;re a lyrical genius. 

while going for trip packing expectations ritik roshan..reality farhan akhtar

Remember bagwati?

Brother, have you forgotten Abhay Deol's name in the title??
Dil Chahata hai (Heart wants),Zindagi Na milegi Dobara (You only live once), Jee Le Zaraa (Live a little ) these movies define a really interesting side of Indian cinema

#<a href="">00:34</a>

Ohh this movie outstanding 

Dil Chahta Hai &amp; ZNMD ... The best movies ever made on friendship.

ZNMD is such an amazing movie that IT NEVER GETS BORING!

The direction for this song is super impressive. On one side, there is Hritik with everything perfection and on the contrast, Farhan with everything messed up.

This film was inspiring I still watch it for time to time to feel it again

Excited for Spain 2022 Finally dream coming true

<a href="">2:00</a> Milk Boy

<a href="">2:21</a> CEO

i am the boss 

When will I go to Spain
2021 folks assemble

This song boost me up to work hard to live this dream in real

That pique and xavi jersey scene give peace to my mind like really

I reached Spain finally. It was a dream after watching this movie.

Jinko ache dost mil jae wohi thik hai spain jane se

<a href="">1:47</a> farhans smile

i am going to watch this movie again!

Listening this song at night- <b>NOSTALGIC</b>

Awesome song

When i first watched that movie i was 13 that time i decided my life should be like this..still working on it ️

I am listening this song in a Spain road trip 2 years ago It was amazing

In  movies everything will be good in reality if  he has job life will be good

so, i also have a trio me and me and my two bsf, they are both very studious and talented with a goal in their life and they are going to be like hritik and abhay while im the dumb and funny one like farhan and like him i also write poems!!!but we still manage to get along loll

The Dil Chahta Hai of younger generation.

I&#39;ll be honest, I learned to pack bags from Hrithik Roshan. Ps. I bought my mum similar &quot;bagwati&quot; he bought, packed in bag almost like him.

Anyone in july 2021?

finally going to spain nex week

Finally going to US

One of my most favourites !! ️️
Hrithik&#39;s costume throughout the movie shows his character development. At the start he is this organised guy with tight fitting clothes, which shows he is locked up in his profession. As the movie progresses, he becomes unorganised, his clothes become loose, showing that his character has started living in the moment

Masterpiece

The way Hrittik arranged his things!!

HAPPY 10YRS TO THIS GREAT AND AWESOME MOVIE 
My dream is to Spain and take a bunglow

This is the best song I jave heard

Nostalgia .  This movie is a very nice feel gud movie. But now bollywood movies are just crap 

Still now its impact on our heart...
Here after its 10th anniversary and the cast   reunion hosted by Excel yesterday

released 10 years ago but stay in our heart forever ️ July 2021

This song is the theme song of all students

10 years of ZNMD...️
Anybody listening to this and roaming around unknown places in Europe 

Mark my words. I will be going for a spain trip before 2027. C u in 2027

10 Years of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaraa from 15th July 2011 to 15 th july 2021 . A decade has passed ,many thing has changed but one thing remain constant for me,The Inspiration from ZNMD. In the last decade i got close to my inspiration and hope within the coming decade I will be able to take Some Schengen trips and complete the madness just as like of ZNMBD

<b><a href="">3:16</a></b><b> You can&#39;t deny that you love the transition of the song from boombox to farhan&#39;s earphones!!</b>

Hrithik&#39;s shocking face when he realized he has to accommodate that &quot;Hermes&quot; Bag in his lugguage :D :D

I just love this song and the movie ️

Expectation of wardrobe - HritikReality- Farhan

Farhan went airport without passport and at cheking he realized he forgot his passport and went home again 

Imran, Kabir and Arjun, welcome to Spain.

This song always runs fresh in my mind ️

During pendemic like Corona..Are you getting the right meaning of this movie?&quot;Zindagi na milegi dobara&quot;️

He is like business MAN

I like the scene ofFarhad khan and air horstisWhere talkingAnd hrithik was turning off light

This music feels going to airport and Go for travelling high wayGoing on road tripsSo goooddddd

Someone want to explain the meaning?

He looks handsome

I like hirthik roshan He came in Free fire

Did you remember the scene of bagmeti 

<a href="">2:10</a> Bagwatii:)

<a href="">3:16</a> transition edit ...lit 
Abhay Deol was traveling in First Class Hrithik in business class Farhan in economy class

Just look at the total contrast of personalities of Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar by the way they pack their stuff

Look how Farhan packing his clothes. His charecter is like me only.

Only for joy baruah ️

I listened this Song more than 100 times and today i am in different country..!!Law of attraction really works..

Hrithik is so sorted. And the way he arranges his belongings! 

Why this song have just 14M views and other Aakhmare , gaandmare songs have millions views

Packing Clothes For A Trip Expectation:-Arjun SalujaReality:-Imran Qureshi
Hey hey, let's go to the sunless city, where the smiling season has turned into a sweet place, when I meet this stranger, we also forget the thoughts that flow from moment to moment, happiness spreads here and there, where the heart goes, baby baby baby, why don't we count till the end, why do we make hearts beat like hearts. Hey hey, let's sing this song, why doesn't anyone open the game like this, everyone's soul is alive, no one sees these flowers and stars, no one sees them, no matter how much we are in love, no matter how much the air opens up, we remain awake. All arms are lost, baby baby baby, why does the heart beat like a heart, why is there any day in the world, the light that beats every day, the father of our heart, the one who comes to the earth, there is no way to walk, there is only a little wonder, baby, we are you, baby, tell me, why are you lost? Why is there a day when the heart beats? Why is there a day when the heart beats? Why is there a day? Why is there a day? Why is there a day?

No his caracatare is fi xbale

No my husband. Search  onley  jab wo free hota hai to who mere pass ata hai.  No time

Gale boy work is best pan husband wife work no balance   sheet.  No

<a href="">2:47</a>

This is life... If you want

When the pandemic ends, I am blasting this song whenever I will go to a new place to visit. 

I wished i hadn&#39;t watched the movie, coz every time i hear this song my heart skips a beat 

<a href="">1:50</a>

The people who sang this song and went to Spain in the sun said that it is theirs.
my fav in this is Farhan Akthar

In this song, I loved hrithik roshan&#39;s house is so well organizrd. I loved it.

Mind refreshing song...

Awesome song

Upmanyu was right..

<b>The movie where Hrithik introduced work from home years ago before it was popular!</b>

I used to live abroad when this movie released. I missed my country so much at that time,I didn&#39;t have a lot of friends so I used to spend my time watching Bollywood movies becoz they reminded me of home. I had lost count of the number of times I watched this movie

Love this song!  However, I edit video for a living, and I feel like from <a href="">0:46</a> to <a href="">0:51</a> is missing at least ONE clip as the chorus swells!  I understand the jump cut technique that the editor was using here, but for some reason, that segment feels like it&#39;s missing something.

No one is appreciating the great work done by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. They lifted this movie to another level........

Amazing movie, lyrics, music, actors, director, locations, shayaris,.....list goes on.

Who has heard from the lockdown?
86,000 positive cases! But ZNMD will never stop being my favorite of all time!

Everones dream...
This movie is one of the  best movie of Bollywood

This song, and a roadtrip with your lovely friends️pefect match

Listening to this song during quarantine

One of the best songs, an also the movies is great, I don&#39;t like &quot;buddy movies&quot; but every time when I watch this movie I want to go on a trip with my friends, have fun, the actors, Hritik, Farhan, and Abhay did it awsome, but also the director Zoya Akhtar did a perfect job with the story the way to tell the story, the messege, the humor, this film it&#39;s perfect yo have fun and laught, for me is one of the best films of Zoya Akhtar

this movie made me realize, hrithik can&#39;t act. he can flex his body, can dance 110%, but he is vomit in this movie.

What a songs!! Friends on europe trip.. And everytime I ask my friends for any trip, I get to hear &#39;paise nhi hai&#39;.. somebody should adopte us so that we can afford for trips.

Reminds me of the many trips to different places in India , my friends and I undertook, and of course the many episodes of getting drunk in Goa, Kerala etc etc

Is it just me or is roshan always looking serious lol 

I can surely tell that this is one of the best indian movie

who is listening this during quarantine?

ZNMD is an master peice such a wonderful ful movie i must say gem ️️️
Who is listening this song in quarantine ....?

ZNMD is that movie which I can watch anytime, anywhere, and still feel good. This movie just has a different feeling and vibe to it, it makes you realize how important life is and how important it is to spend your time doing the things you love. One of the best Bollywood movie in my opinion.

What happens to Bollywood now? Really!! They are just appointing Tanishk Bagchi who has no ideas of original music and always make remakes. Bollywood should appoint Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy for best music and this message is especially for T-Series(Hit like and reply if you agree)

<a href="">#39;ve made a song in quarantine using ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARAand guess what .....people loved it

How is that this song only has 11M views, when it should be 1B

Sum41 into the deep

who&#39;s listening to this in April,2020?

thats my favorite movie

Pleasure song love it
Khel aisa kyun n khel...jisme ho sab ki hi jeethit like
In znmd 2 I want Ranbir, Ranveer and Ayushman..who agreed hit like️️️

Me and my 2 frds hoing to canada after 7 months my mind is think in this video we are in

When everyone came up with romcoms and action movies, Zoya Akhtar came up with movie on friends road trip. The movie released at the time when there is no culture of road trip in India. This is one of the best Bollywood movie.

Ah.. the good old times when music was actually good.. now it feels like shitloads of bullcrap

This movie taught me best meaning of life

Anyone missing travelling? ️<a href="">#quarantine</a><a href="">#covid</a>_19

Turn on captions to enjoy more

This movie was a masterpiece..lived every moment of it

Farhan flirting with the cute air hostess. :-)

Hey Hey! Hey Hey, let's go and play the game like this, why don't we play the game, everyone knows us, no one can see, no one can see, no one can see us, no matter how many of us are in the open air, we are all armed, baby, baby, till the heart of our heart. Why is it that every day there is a heartbeat, what is the reason behind the heartbeat?
Have watched this movie over 20 times still everytime I watch this movie it feels like I&#39;m watching it for the very first time.

Who wants to travel with friends in Europe but don’t have money like me ( btw I live in Europe )

Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara is one of my most favourite <a href="">films.It</a> has a social message that you only live <a href="">once.So</a> make the most of this life and never have regrets.

At <a href="">1:40</a> Farhan almost forgets his passport while going on a trip to spain. Such a messy character 

Expectation: Hrithik WardrobeReality: Farhan Akhter wardrobe 

Best movie ever made in Bollwood.
Seat belt scene was best

most refeshing song on internet

Zoya Akhtar knows how to make a good movie

Wardrobe Expectation: Hrithik sirsWardrobe Reality: FaRhAnS   Edit #1: Thank You so Much for the 150 Likes! It&#39;s not much but it means a lot to me :)

Where the dreams of my clothes come true, Hrithik's struggle begins...
I don&#39;t know what Arda Turan is doing at <a href="">2:15</a>.

No matter how people gyrate about &#39;Gully Boy&#39;, ZNMD will forever remain Zoya Akhtar&#39;s best work ever.Edit : Wow, 3K likes! I have never had so many likes in any of my comments. Goes on to show how much love ZNMD gets, almost 10 years since it released. Keep the love flowing!

Perhaps 1 of the best self realization movie.
