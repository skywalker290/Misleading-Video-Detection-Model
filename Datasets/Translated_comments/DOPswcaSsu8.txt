It is $15,000+ worth that computer huh?

Logi master 3s mouse

very good man
I‘d rather buy a car

I miss marquees with glasses

I guess you have to use a dongle for a billion dollar production super computer 

Should I spend 57k on this?

i can gap this

And now they are worthless . All M2 models own the mac pros

Marquese its like you time traveled 3 years back in time.

Is the sound louder ? Macs normally have the best sound

Yea but the power isn’t back to my wallet

Just like to original Cheese-grater. Apple loses support for it 2 years later......

The max out spec Of MAC PRO in INDIA as of 2022 costs around Rs. 59,00,000 (59 lakh), that’s around 73,000 USD.

The best computer for a creator

Bro, how many fps does this device get in Valorant? Let me tell you, daddy, let's sell the kidneys.
and now two years later the mac studeio has completely defeated the purpose of the mac pro

Serious question, what profession/task requires 300+ GB OF RAM WTF?!

Great. All I need is £48,000. In a trillion years, maybe.

Hi bro iam from tamilnadu

Can anyone find me this wallpaper Marques is using

Damn Marques get new glasses. They are very ugly

I open Safari on my toutch bar mac for approximately 5 seconds and it sounds like a new Elon musk rocket

Imagine the m1 chip on the Mac Pro

It is funny how &#39;pro&#39;s&#39; are video editing their videos about &#39;video editing&#39; haha..

Holy shit he bought the 1000 dollar stand twice

This is a Nice video.. So inspiring but do anyone knows about expert Mrs Jessica Lee is legit and her method works works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy

“Pimply little twerp”

Man......apple really does have some of the best packing and design. It&#39;s like a freaking work of art and a computer.

15k usd apple computer + 50usd logitech mouse..
Why you don’t talk like black peoples

Apple: Let’s be environmental-friendly, no charger for iPhones.Also Apple: Two gigantic Apple plastic stickers.

Why buy a fully loaded machine from Apple. The smart move would be to buy the minimum config from Apple and add in more RAM, SSD etc later. Waaaay cheaper to do it this way.

a fully maxed out one costs like 60 k with some accessories like wtf

just because your video comes with a lot of ads i’m unsubscribing you

Why you don&#39;t add subtitles

Trash ass video

Bruh for the price of that you could get an insanely faster custom pc

Mac pro : I have 384gb RAMChrome : &quot;OUR&quot; RAM !!!

Wtf 15,000 dollars
employees: how much storage do you want?tim cook: yes

What is wrong with you ?!

I still use old computer
<a href="">4:20</a> render speed you know what 420 means...

Can I buy this and have 2 other users use it simultaneously in a video production studio? i.e One user doing video editing with 4K footages, another user working on after effect and another user working on Photoshop? I have been looking for videos online that can explain the process. I will be grateful if you can explain if this is possible.

I’m struggling to get a new laptop

ngl that pc looks like a cheese grater

This recommended after I saw iPhone Do’s impressive Mac pro review

I have 1 TB

This is a crazy  flex, respect 

The gleaming carriage technically hurry because lunge multivariably fetch across a upbeat smoke. demonic, odd eyelash

This looks like a super power house for Data Science Deep Learning work ! :D

Thanks for this review man. Super helpful

Could it be that there are insane conservationists on top of people who are supposed to preserve buildings and hack their data so companies don't get jobs because you think you should preserve the sane, you're not that insane in your heads, are you? How and what do you do to prevent this? Inside independent southern halls in the world?
Does it also apply to the construction industry and other industries with work phone ID and work data ID, etc. You work on closed systems in the construction offices and sit and calculate tenders and shown. You then take the computer machine with you, then your data machine is scanned via your wefi network or is it locked up towards work so no one can see? How do you deal with the fact that it can be used to spy on and calculate tenders or cheat by having digital hackers in a construction company and in the food industry hacking others or simply nailing digital espionage?
What happens with your children's appeal id codes nor You end up at schools in Norway where you use their products to film and take pictures with editing make things on your wild da id code follow the children from schools or delete their school id and you lose everything what you have done on your products and it doesn't want to follow you further in your life or does it want to follow you for the rest of your life and do you analyze teachers and students learn level through your data sources or have school systems are closed systems you don't have access to what happens then when you come and go out with others, follow your ID that is locked to schools then and you drive your ID when you are out on the open web, then do you analyze it?

That ram is bigger than my hdd lol

The MacBook air is faster then that beast.well in 2020 . welcome to future

<a href="">8:30</a> fun fact: MacBook Air M1 has the same hard disk loading speed 

I&#39;m done with Microsoft and PC&#39;s. No longer gaming and PC&#39;s are just too buggy to do any creating of content. Not to mention the continuous need to subscribe to programs in order to write. PC&#39;s are just too much to upkeep, even when I built the thing myself 9 years ago.

I want this more than I need it

Now CJ can play his own character in GTA

When he says <b>Oh yeah and its really fast</b>

What’s the future of Mac Pro?? Apple could just commit OS support for 3 years (including transition period), what next ?? This could be the most expensive Mac to be tossed out in four years!

Ok who don&#39;t know ram does not matter for Video CPU does Not Matter for Video SSD does not Matter for Video, OS or Windows Does not matter for Video Video card does not matter for Video. JK Yes Video Card does matter for Video. There is no point to get Apple for 20k to Edit 8k Video. You could use any rayzen 9 or thredtriper and will get the same result with a lot less money

Hi my name is Jesus Garcia. Nick name is Brazil. I had seen your video. And it all New what I seen . Is my first time seeing the Mac Pro . I had seen the iMac Pro laptop 16 inches and the iMac Pro 27 inches. But I see the the Mac Pro is big . How many inches of the Screen. I would like to know about all about that. I like your video and thank you for sharing the potential that it has. Keep it safe God Bless. Later piece 

He is telling me the I am a poor person for <a href="">11:33</a>

This computer has more RAM than my macbook air has RAM, storage has combined....lol

Fanboiiis.....Thank you Apple for robbing fanboiiis.

CAN&#39;T UNDERSTAND  SHIT

Nice, but what  monster, I&#39;d hate to have to troubleshoot a problem with this thing. Everything is very nice until something goes wrong.  Wow I&#39;ll bet $$$$$ too :o

Pray for the beloved
Fun fact: At a lower price, you can make a 64 core Threadripper with 2 RTX 3090s, 2 1500w PSUs, 2TB RAM, RGB RAM heatsinks, 14tb of PciE m.2s, 64tb of HDD, the best peripherals, A Lian LI desk cabinet with space for two PCs, a water-cooled PS4/Xbox/both, water cooling for the PC, 3 4k 120hz TVs/1 8k TV and all Adobe products and it would still cost less than this.Oh, and an entire home theatre systemI know it&#39;s practically impossible, just wanted to compare

when you realise that tyour whole home=his mac pro if you want to buy it then you have to sell your both kidneys(lol)

Am I the only one that thought it looked like an AC with an Apple logo

But a gaming PC is more worth it.B r u h 300gb of RAM?? WHO DOES A JOB USING 100GB OF RAM?

Olive Garden: 
I hate Mac Pro it cost $600 to add 1tb to your Mac Pro it’s just adding screws and plugging it in

Fuk you apple for ripping everyone off againg dont buy the mac just get a gaming pc or buid one with better specs for less

Wait so how is that a computer I’m kinda confused to what the Mac Pro even is

I mean I just bought an entry level MacBook pro 13 and I thought that, that was a sick buy

YO THE CHEESE GRATER BUILT DIFFERENT 
That&#39;s a big ass fucking apple logo 

I ready to wait for 18 min

All I see is expensive garbage.

Your so rich! I dont even have enough to buy a poor cheapest pc. Im hapoy for you carry on you good work on a very good camera and good internet.

YO SOMEONE PASS THE CHEESE

Hey 30fps on SuperMario bro?

Don’t read more If u have come here u r a bitch

Hdhdhjde
I am quite surprised by how much faster the Mac Pro is compared to the MacBook Pro and iMac Pro.

I love how Marques uploaded this on my birthday

I have one question...Can it play frogger ?

Well the software support on this is gonna shorten by at least 2 years given that arm&#39;s gonna replace x86 on Macs

<a href="">3:30</a> How is his display so smooth?

Forrest Gump: &quot;it was the strangest thing, I received a fancy computer from some fruit companayyyy&quot;

dude has an IMAX theater for a computer screen fucking shit that is huge!

Has anyone realized that every tech YouTuber vid  always runs in 4k?

shut up laude
finally!!! now i can run minecraft at 15 fps!!!

Who the heck actually bought this thing

If you want everything good on this it cost close to 50,000 dollars

Since Al-Hwait
This thing probably has more ram than if you actually put a ram into your computer

Mac Pro: I have 384 GB of RAMGoogle Chrome: There is no more RAM left.

<a href="">9:14</a> nice.  If you get it you get it. If you don’t then you don’t.

Not unlike a virus, Apple software &#39;updates&#39; end up killing your machine, so you then have to buy another one from the greedy rotten apple.

Whoa

I thought apple brought same thing  isn&#39;t it like my cheese shredder Don&#39;t Read my name

play some game on it -_- :)

No, the expensively Mac Pro. Used 2010 Mac Pro with metal graphic card.

I see so many comments about how expensive or redundant this is, but I have a conclusion: If your multimillion dollar projects have deadlines, then it&#39;s not expensive.

Is it possible to permanently block Marques Brownlee videos from EVER showing up in my suggested video feed? I am so not a fan of this channel.

With 3000$ U can EZ builds ae beast PC for work and game

FYI: Do not buy this for gaming.

Apple sucks.

Can it run GTA vice city at 720p ?

Most people in the comments are saying this is too expensive,but i think this is mainly built for huge companies or big editors or movie editors who need the performance and have quite abit of money.and not for normal joes like us but thats just my opinion.

Why did this make me horny

Why do you have a confederate flag

Tell Mac to go to bed.
for $15k i could buy the best gaming pc every with four monitors and still edit like a beast waste of money lol

Save your time <a href="">1:07</a> thank me later

Not gonna lie the Mac pro kinda looks like a cheese grinder

so thats what we called &quot;Mac&quot; and Cheese

Nah. I already gave a cheese grater at home

Like dtokko
MKBHD &quot;Maybe you can put them on a car&quot; ME: Struggling to buy a car, but definitely think bout a $50000 Mac Pro 

Sick intro track
holy smokes. over 300 GB of ram? thats like, almost a hundred more than my laptop which has 4 GB. also 64 GB GPU? what game are you even going to use than on?

Or you could build a pc

Me: just got an i9 processorMKBHD: hey so I&#39;ve been daily driving Quantum Computing for about 20 years at this point.

Is it just me or is the side of the Mac look like a cheese grinder

Is that made in china ?

Why is the best mac pro you can get 40,000 usd. Like WTF Apple.

when are you going to drop test for this????

No offense who ever buys the Mac Pro is a retard

Marques stronk boi

lol i saw this video today and i saw that it was posted on my 18th birthday &gt;&lt;

Can it run minecraft?

What a nice cheese grater

Finally I can play Minecraft smoothly without glitches when I blow up 1 million tnt’s

Where can I find that wallpaper?

Strip the spec back on it and run the rendering tests again... It would be interesting to see the difference.

eye laser operation just couple of minutes and you are ready to go...

I&#39;m Gonna cut off and sell my arm and leg to buy this.

On the website I thought it was an overpriced 5000 dollar cheese grater from apple

A lot of people can’t understand y so much RAM RED RAW FOOTAGE And   ARRI ALEXA RAW FOOTAGE they are the most Expensive and best Movie Cameras in the MarketIn other words if you work in the movie industry 384GB is Basic today

It doesn’t have rgb lights not buying it

Thank you.

Mac pro 2019 buyer regret...apple switches to amd cpu or arms cpu. Apple says....sucker.

I rarely or not all use macs no more...forced to use macs education and creative arts in college...only option really back in day besides limited dell desktop. Now microsoft/linux and hardware options made big leaps in progress for creatives. Mac pro 2019 cost too much for most.

384 gb ram? WTF is this beast?

Guys i need subscribers can you help me guys 
How much price?

this computer is very cool
Appolo Guidance Computer - I took humans to the moon with 2kb ramMac Pro  with 1.5tb ram - I&#39;ll be sending humans to planets in the other end of the galaxyUpdate - Wheels got Released : Guess what,  I&#39;ll be landing with them too

how is the heat situation in there?

Who came for the flow?
Thumbs up if you would pay $40/hr to use this (remote acceptable)

Like Malayali
Brazil
I dont see how this would be useful to the average consumer.

Just wondering if you really paid full retail.  I get a discount though work so I can get the base model for something like $500 off.

Finally I can do something.

Does it drive you to work?

One like, one GB RAM more

So anyways I started using my &quot;tweezers&quot;

Me: oooooo I might buy that *looks at price*Then just for the sake of it sees the most expensive configuration.THATS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRICE OF MY MOMS AND DADS CAR COMBINED BRUHhHh

Can you run crisis?.
What’s the price tho?

What’s the price tho?

Can you use any screen with the Mac Pro or it has to be a Mac Screen?And also,, is the Pro Display XDR a stand alone Mac or its made to be used with the Mac pro?

Mr.overconsumer your unboxing style is really worst.Alwaus &#39;URAVGCOSUMER&#39;S unboxing style is awesome

Completely useless !  you can have a much much more powerful machine with PC and and tens of thousands cheaper, yes tens of thousands.

Chrome system requirementsRam: 1.5 tbProcessor: Intel 28 core xeon wGpu : 4 amd vega graphic cardsSpace: 50 mb

Me: Why do you not always point out flaws in apple products and try to make your point in favor of apple even if they do have some issues?Marques: Because they pay me for this 

I can literally buy a gaming pc, two monitors, a keyboard, a mouse, and a mousepad for less than what this costs

I want to get the wheels 700 dollars: Let me introduce myself

And you could have found somthing better for halve the money

What’s the life expectancy for this guy?

I need this in my life ASAP I have been rendering a minute and a half long video from After Effects for 3 hours and there&#39;s still an hour left. I have an hp laptop.

WTF is this? I thought box servers went the way of the dodo. Is this for running 16 windows at once. Or maybe CAD/Cam systems industrially?

I&#39;ve wouldn&#39;t have even unboxed it at the first place cuz I&#39;m too scared of placing my fingerprints on such a beauty

I would like you to test out how it would hold up if you shipped it to my house see if it would return to you

Most everyone, myself, included, watch YouTube on tablet or phone. Why would you invest time and money into creating 8K content that’s going to be watched on a 10 inch screen?! I know it’s sounds like a silly question, but I couldn’t help wondering.

Can you do gaming on it?

In my opinion it was a huge mistake not to add a decent dust filter!Trust me!

how much does apple pay you? you know this shit not worth the money. I bet you recomend bying the wheels too smh sell out

Can it run Minesweeper at 30fps?

imagine u buy a mac pro for the apple stickers!

Dang, I just picked up a used 2010 Mac Pro and it thrills me to have that much power.

this should bring a smile to your face

daaaaamn that ram is total overkill lol

i saw similar to this one in pursuit of happniess, x ray machine will smith desperately tried to selling!!!

Not considering the rice, Apple is the best.

We need a speed test

play a game on it :&#39;D

Apple : presents you the iPhone 2x Marques : I have using the iPhone 2x from the last 20 years and here’s what I think

Me thinking the whole video where’s the monitor 

Does anybody know how long these MACS can operate properly? 5 years? 10 years? Thank you!! :-)

When you get red  of it call me I have $1000 for it

apple is doomed. mac pro is garbage i mean 15k? why.? i can build a 3k gaming pc and destroy this trash

384GB of RAM. But can it do any games like call of duty

fuck the poorness

How much do you make form youtube?

He is Leaving Gooooood...

Thanks bro, when will the csgo fps test come out (can you do it in Metin2)
My mom wants to know if it can play solitaire?

Wait what is it

Only as a YouTuber you can buy all those things?

I’m still looking to buy any my first MacBook Pro used off course  for editing . Damn this guy is so lucky he is got the latest Mac Pro I can only image the speed of this monster

Me watching on my iMac mid 2011 with 4GB of Ram,Intel core i5 3rd generation and 512 MB of VRAM which takes 4 minutes 20 seconds to launch premiere and infinity time to export a 1080 video

<a href="">3:07</a> that’s a monster , like seriously who the hell in the world needs 384gb ramOk i understand server , workstation , video editing etc BUT WHO NEEDS 384GB ? Most servers probably don’t have more than 64-128gb ram<a href="">3:15</a> THE F 70TB EXTERNAL HDD/OR EVEN SSD ? (This dude‘s going rich but also crazy)

me : can i get this device in heaven when i die?Marques : so i have been in heaven for two weeks and here&#39;s my thoughts

Why didnt you connect the logi mouse via bluetooth so that you can get a usb-a free ?

——How much display memory do you have？——128GB——OK,i knew you are rich,But I&#39;m asking how much show memory is instead of memory，the storage.——It&#39;s really 128gb, four lines.——....So how big is your memory?——1.5TB——I&#39;m asking you about memory instead of hard drive.——Yes,I got 12 128gb memory bars——.......................

But can it play minecraft?

Who is Apple selling this to? It has some insane specs that sound awesome, but it seems well beyond what most consumers would be looking for in a computer. Extremely high end video editing? Couldn’t a much less powerful computer handle even that?

U need to get the dbrand skin for the mac pro! Get it in matte mkbhd colors. Please!

hey bro i saw a dream while i was sleeping...i saw a mac which had 28 cores of cpu- 384 GB of ram...and 32Gb graphic card!!! but finally i understand i was awake...R U fucking kidding ME?!?!?!

Damn you, our computer is expensive
Even i can&#39;t afford a single stand in my entire life 
Omg i love it also its so perty

No benchmarks...
I really won’t a Mac Pro naw

So with the all the bells and screamers, how will it work and/or stand up to, Adobe Premiere CC series? I like that you like, what you do, it&#39;s very understanding and fresh! thanks!

Of you have this pc, but have bad internet connexion.... you will die

just fuck you

Nice!

I don’t get it. This is a computer!?

Is incredible how machines are getting faster and faster... I&#39;m still using my iMac from 2011 and it still feels pretty fast to me. lmao

Im selling a kidney who&#39;s buying

I&#39;m from the future. Beware the wheels. They have no locks.

Where’s the Mac? Am I being dumb?

Someone clarify this for me. This is the top brand model that they don&#39;t make each year? Correct? If you buy one of these; it should entertain you until the next big one debuts; which is generally some years in between?

But can you play crysis?

Gosh , it looks like a toaster

Damn that things clean looking

can you test metro 2033 on it ???  ...   please

Wonder what he does with his old tech honestly I wish I could buy some of it

<b>I literally still don&#39;t get what this is</b>

<a href="">4:45</a> imagine if those were really cameras.

Yes io

This video call me poor in 100 different languages

It&#39;s just a cheese greater with a $200 pc in there

Is the Mac Pro a tower? Never answered my question in the video

Is Mac macaroni for short??

its almost powerful enough to run minecraft with clouds on.

WHAT IS THE ACTUAL CPU FREQUENCY WHEN ALL CORES ARE UNDER MAX LOAD ??? THANK YOU. iMac 18 cores (2.3ghz) fluctuates between 2.1 and 2.8 under max load, mostly around 2.53 ghz.

It looks like a cheese grater

Plays csgo at 31 fps
I remember back in his old video when he was explaining AirPower, he was praying for the Mac Pro not to be cancelled. lmao..

Nice cheese grader
Marques: you need to put lockable wheelsApple: and you need a single leveled floor

It’s so faaaaaaast
good

32gb each card ? Mooooooooooooomyyyyyyyyy help.
def taking that to the uni one day

ur fucking dumb why would you buy this??

No muny

can we be friend ?

I’m wondering if the high and low power configurations of Mac Pro are the same? If the CPU has the same power, can I upgrade it myself?
How much is this?
so its good for gaming?

apple cheese grader
Can u crave chees for me

Should I switch to Mac?
Hey guys Indian version of mkbhd is here

I wouldn&#39;t take that shit for freeOr take it and sell it to a dumbass apple fan

Looks like something my mother would use to cut cheese

Apple service is shit..  last month my Mac pro broke down, so I pulverised it, then set it on fire... I collected the ashes and told them to fix it.. They didn&#39;t... Boycott apple..

Still 35,000$ for a workstation like that is a lot. Even the starting point of 6500$ is a lot for what you actually get.

I have a 2012 Mac Pro 5.1 with a 3.46ghz 12 Core processor, 128GB RAM, 1TB of NVMe SSD (system updated to Mojave that supports NVMe) and a RX 580 8GB graphics card. I wonder how this compares to a similar model of the 2019 Mac Pro.

Oh I gust reaslised is it a pc

It looks like a cheese grater

What does MKBHD means

384 ram... how?

<a href="">9:19</a> 4 20 exactly?!?!?! Nice.

I&#39;m shocked that you didn&#39;t mention value in your review.

Did this guy really buy the ducking stand?

I hope you would reply my message, thank you in advance. I am trying to purchase the Mac Pro for myself, but I run into some problems. I asked the Genius Bar, the sales representative and the tech department via phone, none of them can provide me with an definitive answer, so here I am. I would like to know if the base graphic is compatible with the LG 5K UltraFine monitor? because I am not so sure whether the base graphic card have thunderbolt 3 port at the back, which is the only connection port the monitor is using. I checked on apple website, and Mac Pro is not on the compatibility list. Can you answer my question? thank you very much

Why ıts so expensive
If you get most expensive everything possible with it it’s 60000 usd

Macbook pro , why buy it when you cane get a used car for that money. Macpro, why buy it when you can get a new car for that money!

People dont realise that the reason the mac pro is so obscenely expensive is because it is not really for personal use. This thing is designed for industry, no individual needs a computer this powerful...   apart from MKBHD ofc

You still need dongles??<b>SCREAMING and LAUGHING internally</b>

The fun part my 4000 pc build is way faster smh Thanks Amd ryzen 9 3900x is a beast

So you&#39;re saying this is worth 50k ...

try to build a beter mac with beter cpu and maybe two terobite

Idk but I want cheese now

“The Incredible true story” Easter egg in the room

any apple hater here? no right? yes well you cant talk shit about this product 

Apple (taking notes) &quot;add 2 others USB door next update&quot;

Where is Mac Pro Review?

Can it run Crysis 3?

For less than half the price you can get a thread ripper and a Titan rtx gpu with custom water cooling that has more than double the power and speed. Just saying xd

Can I have one of the apple stickers? Thank you.

I make YouTube videos and all my equipment put together costs less that that stand itself 

&lt;3

Nice machine but a bit expensive. There is room for a cheaper cheese grater CUBE

<a href="">4:23</a> im sorry but id rather the magic mouse than that thing

Idk, xsThank God that Rozetked filmed a normal review
Can ihave a mac pro plsss

Let&#39;s see how it does with a heavy Adobe Media encoder work load.

but what is it?

Don&#39;t bother with this. Get a PC from Digital Storm instead.

$50,000! WhAT

Apple is overcharging for the cheapest LR-DIMM from Micron (CAS23) - If you want faster R-DIMM memory don&#39;t go above 192GB or upgrade yourself. Memory frequency and speed is NOT the same thing. Macbook Air&#39;s DDR3 2133Mhz CAS 11 speed index is 193.9 - New Mac Pro&#39;s DDR4 2933Mhz CAS 23 speed index is 127.5 which is 34.2% SLOWER than Macbook Air&#39;s memory. 

Nice cheese grater
Go subscribe to my YouTube channel I do gaming videos and some Fortnite videos make sure you subscribe for good luck

Bro, that looks like something I throw my half eaten bagel in.

As usual with 6000+ USD  one can easily assemble a machine that could wipe the floor with this one.People paying premium for brand hardware, smh.

u might look smart wearing those glasses but using and promoting this mac pro shows that your just a dumbass..

I checked out his exact configuration on the Apple store... $30, 458.99 CAD OR $23, 069.40 USD!

The side of the Mac Pro looks like a cheese grater

overprice piece of shite ...

Marques is the whitest black guy you&#39;ll ever meet

I would not be using Intel for a workstation in 2020 and I would not use AMD cards ever for a workstation

How has no one tested the 12 monitors this thing can  Supposably run. Or the 4 or 6 XDR monitors it can run at once???

Marcus, why did you turn it on at 3 minutes? What about the box, the sled and that’s all? Missed 20 minutes of content
leave it to apple to make a machine that has second rate hardware and find a way to overcharge on all of it

The render speed is 420  <a href="">9:16</a>

I&#39;ve been studying speeding up Macs and discovered an awesome resource at Achak speed plan (check it out on google)

Advice: Buy it, people, it is not Arabic
2.5 GHz 28-core CPU, 384 GB of RAM (upgradable to 1.5 TB?!?!) and 32 GB of VRAM...? woah!!!

If I got one with wheels it would probably roll away

Hey Marques can I borrow it I have some cheese to grate

but the price...

So will this be able to run far cry 5 on max settings with this?

Love your channel. I‘ve bought a Mac Pro 2019 16 core with a Radeon Pro Vega II Duo rendered a few projects in After Effects and was surprised by its underwhelming GPU acceleration. Have you made similar experiences? Do you know any fixes?

Some things never change 1. iPhone design 2. Wonderful unboxing experience of Apple&#39;s products.

Good product, over kill performance, and amazing price. Wonder which industry need this PC, definitely not for gaming industry

But can it run Minecraft?

Holy shit that looks so fucking cool and has so many cool features first I thought this shit looks so ugly but now man it’s amaizing i can’t describe how amazed I am

I got a samsung ad for this lmao

Looks terrible, like a cheap electric heater.

Wow that’s impressive but can it run Crysis?

$34,548.00lol

the world ending, everyone&#39;s dying: aaahhhhhhmMarques: &quot;so i&#39;ve been dead for the past 2 weeks now, and here&#39;s what i think.&quot;

well... dbrand came out with a skin for the Mac Pro... maybe review lol

I saw someone buy one of these from the Apple store a few months ago… he had to be escorted to his car by two security guards…

I&#39;m dumb but would it be possible to run a whole operating system off memory.

384gb of rammmmmmm reallyyyy i saw 64 gb ram pc upto now for the people who buy this jewel

WWDC= World Wide Dick Conference 

This thing renders 8k video faster than we can actually watch the video

why i&#39;m watching this ?? i can&#39;t even afford that stupid mouse O__o ! i&#39;m so poor :/

why do no manufactures put hepa filters on the cases? I&#39;ve been running hepa filters for more than a decade...

I love how apple makes their motherboards 180 degrees opposite normal mother boards

If you max it out on Apple website it comes out to over 54,000

So, Apple makes a Mac Pro this awesome looking and you&#39;d still have to plug in a mouse receiver to use the custom made mouse. How intuitive. ‍️ 

No wires
Now review 400$ wheels

But can it run crysis

Do you shoot in red ross?

Marques, can you please do a video about.Mac Pro vs Hot Lava?

Damn thing doesn&#39;t even come in black

I could listen to you talk all day. Just so knowledgeable on ever topic and videos you put out. You can tell that a lot of time is put into your videos and it is very much appreciated.

gift give me THAT PC for shipping
gift regalame ESA PC

Boo

Where is the actual reviews and all other video about it??

Too bad that Mac OS Catalina has some serious problems with the Audio Bluetooth connection since its launch. It&#39;s practically impossible to use any audio wireless device. The connection keeps dropping every few seconds, minutes, hours..

Bro in Pakistan and India no can buy this Mac pro

Bro in Pakistan and India no can buy this Mac pro

Not hating on Marques videos but i find him difficult to listen to from his rather monotonous voice

Still not worth

Hi Marques.Have seen many of your posts. They seemed very enlightening. Your new Apple WOW. Just a little envious :-) I would ask if you could not edit a video I recorded on a sunny day .. When playing video I see strange things.I call it. Observed moving objects. (new concept) When playing video at slow speed ,you discover even more details .. You will be surprised :-)  If you want to help me edit the video I will be happy :-) I thank you. stensen @ mac . com

2 usb ports, my Hackintosh is laughing. GPU-us is ok. I have one VEGA64.  AMD Threadripper 3990X is the future.

<b>Is it worth the price</b>

This is overpriced by thousands of dollars

Well you could say Apple tried to make the Mac <b>GRATER</b> again

Plz do giveaway
You spent so much money to just edit a 12 or 13 minute YouTube video stupid 

My storage server 2020: Pentium III 900, 256 MEGS ram on RAMBUS, 5 hdds, total 1.2 TBs. Still on Windows 2003. Gotten quite slow, but I&#39;m too lazy to upgrade.

1000 dollar stand? yea, fuck you apple.

Please translate for the Arabic.️

Why did u buy a cheese grater instead of an actual mac

<a href="">9:15</a>  nice 420
Apple sheep at its finest

Can’t even say peripherals properly
And now AMD rolls up with a 64 core Threadripper that crushes this thing in CPU performance 

imagine you have to buy the components in this shit separately since apple is known for doing that shit

I don&#39;t think I need something like this. Windows just works for me

Tesla should build a computer, that can be cheaper and faster than the Apple PC.

Fortnite and marques brownlee

Can it run Minecraft?

No Dustfilter? 15K???

Hey MKBHD. Would you hook me up with the 16’ MacBook Pro now that you have “The PowerHouse” in the House? Ever since I started watching your videos back in 2013, I have never stopped to date. You are my to go person when it comes to tech. Blessed 2020. Thanks for Retro Tech too. 

It’s more expensive than my car yet it only has 2 USB ports 

Basically, Cheese Grater Pro.

<a href="">0:11</a> yeah if i to-

I am kinda bugged at <a href="">4:15</a> the fingerprints aren&#39;t cleaned off the mouse ! hahaha

That internal is just pure Art.  Absolutely amazing.  Other than that, total waste of money.  And who would ever design a case that nice to have a removable vent screen like the $50 cases come with...Another video of rich people playing with rich toys that no one in the comment section can probably afford.  I guess Youtube has given them all someplace to show off at least.

<a href="">09:09</a>

They don&#39;t lie when they say that the Mac Pro is blazing fast.

“The three big frans at the front” haha

play games on it

it looks like something you have in the bathroom to hang towels on

Can You Game on a $6,000 Mac Pro??

You got a text from NASA, they want their Computer back.

like a month ago when I saw it I was like apple made a cheese grader?

Try testing single core performance particularly in Logic Pro , where a single channel strip in any DAW can only use a single core,  load a channel strip with a Kontakt instrument and a stack of CPU intensive plugins inserts like Space designer and see how many it can run before it craps out..then compare it to your other Mac’s..

The Price is ?

Is this the guy who failed to build a pc?

Sooo good
Why does it look like a cheesegrader?

So? Can it plays minecraft, or roblox?

Holy that mashine is ugly

I would throw that magic keyboard and mouse thinking it is an ordinary piece of thermocol

Test it on gaming

45k

Can I install Windows on it?

Nice haricut Marques
I would pay to see someone grate cheese on it

You pay that much for a computer and you get two full size USB ports wtf

Is that a giant cheese grater?

We are watching this but we can’t buy it

I&#39;m here using a laptop with only 4gb ram and a tower pc with 8gb ram when theres people using over 300gb ram holy shit

This computer is just ridiculous. First off I think it is by far the ugliest Mac Pro, then there is the absurd cost of the performance for the entry model. I recently got a new PC laptop with similar yet better specs for about half the price, and it was from a very high-end manufacturer. This is just for companies who need something crazy.

Samsung: for hardwaregoogle: for softwarehuawei, xiaomi etc: all around decent phones for a nice priceApple: <b>FLEX FLEX FLEX IVE ALSO GOT 2 ROLEX</b>

It looks like a cheese grater...

Wauw.    Your Apple computer Thankyou much for This video Dear Marques️
Tell me. why tf do you need 300GB of ram

more ram? im here with 8 gigs

Someone  anyone  gift me your  old  mac you keep  in the garage 

I&#39;m curious to know from a PC builder perspective. Wouldn&#39;t it of been far cheaper and far more effective if you just used a  none-Apple PC and you could then have as many USB ports depending on the case and customize it to your heart content.

&quot;384 gb of ram&quot;Finally, I can run 4 tabs in chrome without lagging.

60.000$

this costs way too much. and its not that good

The cheese mashine

god i hate apple i purposely  go to your home and destroy that pos shit computer

Is this worth it for this money ?

New mac: The Triplephobia Series

Apple:So,we will release a $999 monitorMe:Hey,thats cheap price for apple monitorApple:oops,we was about to tell monitor standMe:Wait WutMeanwhileApple fans seen the adAlso apple fans:

Hey can u play some video games that require good specs with it?

I wonder how much cheese I could grate with this.

How many chrome tabs can I open on it?

Drop test!!  LOL.

Mkbhd <a href="">9:14</a> = &quot;..exported in four minutes : twenty senonds,&quot;Me = nice

&#39;4 minutes and 20 seconds&#39;Your Mac is high, literally

speak english
Also Review on the heaviest triple A game you can find and set the settings to ultra and benchmark it i&#39;m curious to know what it&#39;s capable of

And here I thought that 64gb is the biggest number of ram that a computer can have and 12gb of graphics card like deym son

<a href="">4:20</a> render time huh?...nice
Broke into some apple store?

<a href="">9:18</a> i am loving the mac pro times

No air filter so expect dust getting in and to get the wheels lol £360.00 how much that’s expensive.  Then the limited usb A   Standard 256gb ssd  or splash out and get 8tb ssd for £2,340.00  afterburner £1,800.00 then  standard graphics 8gb  or get the 2 Radeon pro vaga ll duo 2x32gb hbm2 memory each, yep that’s is 64gb for £9,720.00.Then lest see you talk about how the processes is linked to your Mac so if it fails you can’t just replace it you will need another loan to buy one from Apple ££££.A fully spec pro will cost £45,000.00 Probably you could make a pc much cheaper and better then that .

Why am I watching it.It makes me more  poor

Bruh, <a href="">4:20</a> minutes?
gaming ? not a main use but a consideration

That is one expensive cheese grater

&#39;&#39;These are the biggest Apple stickers I have ever seen, maybe you can put them on your car or something&#39;&#39; The car you do not have but could have had if you did not spend the money on a computer lol

Just &#39;tapped&#39; into you  for the first time. I like the way you present this video. I just bought my &quot;cheese grater&quot; along with the stand on December 27, 2019. I bought it with this configuration: 2.7GHz 24-core Intel Xeon W Processor, 32 GB RAM (am upgrading later to 384GB-maybe?), 4TB SSD, no afterburner card and of course, the pro display and stand. My question is: for music production where I&#39;ll use a cazillion plugins over 300 + audio tracks, will 384GB 6x64GB be enough to do the job, or will I need to boost it up? Let me know, because I haven&#39;t bought the RAM yet. I&#39;d appreciate the feedback. Thanks:)

So does that mean I can Play Minecraft without any lags or it?

All I see is a transformer cheese shredder

hey what is lowkey means im not speak english

This is apples way of saying we&#39;re losing money so we&#39;re gonna charge $50,000 for a desktop and hope the people who are loyal will save us

I now need Linus to take this apart and then drop it

I think it's much prettier without the casing that looks like a grater.
Is it good for playing roblox?

Test gaming

Test it by rendering a GreenHippo Flexres .PNG and flexresvideo file with a 100 million pixel comp in After Effects. (Yea, this is a thing.)

Can we get a gameplay so we can understand how good the graphic cards are?

<b>I dun know seems overpriced  to me</b>

Man I wish pc’s were cheaper I want to get into some pc gaming but I need to spend a little over a grand to get something minimum it’s crazy how much companies mark up prices of parts just like this thing can add up to $50,000 for an apple pc absolutely insane

<a href="">4:20</a>

<a href="">2:27</a> I can smell this picture

Wallpaper link anyone?

this thing has more gigs in its ram than in my ssd

How badly do I need my left kidney anyway?

Test it out with gaming!

i’m confused how is this even a computer

Ok. This must be for medicine. Like 384 gb of ram? You better be editing and rendering  avatar 2 while simultaneously playing crysis on ultra, WHILE running 5000 google chrome playing youtube videos

The legs on the mac cost 400$ :l i have a GTX1070 for 300$

“Frans at the front” <a href="">7:46</a>

So I&#39;ve been in 2020 for 2 weeks now...

<b>That&#39;s a lot of RAM. Who would want that? Probably me.</b>

Thats that apple computer that cost 20-40k.  U could buy a car with that money

Biggest flex for a cheese grader

This is the most expensive cheese grater ever smh

But can it run Crysis?

can we play cyberpunk 2077

Awesome video. Keep up the good work. Since I switched to Apple note book pro.   I will never go back to any other regular PC. I do personal photo editing and use it as a personal computer.  Never had an issue with software or hardwareWorks all the time Only issue with Apple is that it is over priced. But I&#39;m sold on there computers

Pls test with videogames? Or minecraft with hardest shaders

Imagine playing a flash gameThe box would explode

8TB of storage isn’t enough,  you need 256 million Terabytes or the estimated storage of your brain so you can store everything in 8K til 2100

I&#39;m still happy with my 300$ PC  : l

It is a shame that in five years Apple will say to you: &quot;Your computer is to old. We don&#39;t serve them anymore... It is a &quot;vintage&quot; computer for us... I used to love Apple but, not any more. When my Macbook Pro dies, unfortunately I will buy a Dell or a Lenovo.

What&#39;s the use of this Mac like what&#39;s the use of being this fast? Why is it manufactured in first place?

Bro, I still can see why he needed so much for so small videos. 99.99% of us cant even see the resolutions that the Mac dishes out. lol

420 <b>Nice</b>

Put a potato in it
Test it for gaming

Do some gaming with cuz its a mac

you should probably get a usb A hub to connect all your usb type A things...

, 

Nice Mac Pro computer, I like the easy way the computer cover can be take off. I like the beautiful and small design of the past apple Cube.

Imagine having mac Pro and have low lantancy in house.

I like the contrast between the Mac and the YouTuber.
bruh
Did it render thr video with the CPU or GPU? Thats also important to note

Before you buy this just ask yourself<b>&quot;How many kidneys do I need to live again&quot;</b>

You could literally build a Petter PC in much less like thousands lessAnd threadrippers have 64 frikkin cores they are insane and this is just....More ram is always appreciated but 300 is still excessive since you most likely never use all of it unless you&#39;re doing some insane rendering or editing idk...Also for most gamers let&#39;s just say this...if you use PCs you play games and there is no point in buying this for games anyway...soooo wellllllYou get the brand name so totally worth it go buy it now and you&#39;ll most likely die of debt.......

Mac before 2019: <b>*waste of money*</b>Mac in 2019: <b>*still a waste of money*</b>

but the real question is: can it run minecraft?

Imagine someone stealing that package.

Apple is a company that is going down due to 3 things quality products, after sell services (all the limits for defects on them products ) and non innovatives one ... I think that with the Mac Pro they raise the limits ... they are selling for 7000 euros aluminium and the exact same device that they launched more than a decade ago ? it’s a ripoff more then that it’s the end of a brand with lack of innovation and the idea that clients are forever  pigeons. The day for a new king to arise is arrived and the Red Sea is wide opened

<a href="">9:14</a> nice
Oooh a new cheese grater

<a href="">7:26</a> I would not recommend putting it on top of a table because it could cause the table to collapse and might cause some heath issues for you.

<a href="">2:29</a> Make sure you take off all of the plastic so it does not overheat and start a fire while you use it.

me can’t even afford for a iphone 5salso me: watch videos about mac pro

Apple profit margins are entirely dependent on slave labor and the added advantage of polluting the rivers in China irrevocably.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not a problem for most of the people who watch these sort of Mac reviews.

Run a game and see

Why is it so fucking expensive? 52 fucking thousand? This company got worse ever since Steve died.

Finally I can open 4 chrome tabs

how to describe the “cheese grater look”:“circles, and then another layer of circles. bro. circles yo”

<a href="">8:33</a> Only 2.7 GB/s slooow. Put inside Samsung Evo M.2 SSDs in RAID and you would get double the speed easily.

I would want to know the gaming experience on this. For all the serious gamers 

MKBHD: looking forward to seeing your comments.Me: Can it really grate cheese?

Cheese grater

The spec still cant run a game

can u run windows on it ?

is that good for gaming?

Its too much config useless , why should everyone buy super computer ??

Sorry Marques I Meant Nice Job Thanks Great Video

Nice Jog Marques
This thing is sick and a dream! but will cost you the average yearly salary!

I’d like to get this just to inbox it

may you check some ML on it?

The base model is 6,000  U.S. Dollars with only 256g Gig  SSD YIKES!!   And they call this a pro? They could at least put 1 TB  SSD especially for the price.

would love to see a heavy 3d modelling renders

I wanted him to grate cheese with it

Why do you need a larger cheese grater?

<del>Mac Pro</del><b>Gigantamax cheese grater</b>

What is full form of mkbhd

Dang I realllyyyy want this with that new display

What if he dropped it down?

If they sell between 50 K and 70k how much wouod it cost apple to make them

Also why have you bought this Mac, you&#39;re doing video editing right? Why do you need Xeon and EEC memory to do that? What a waste...you could have spent the same money and got a PC that is so much better suited to your workflow.

But can I shred cheese with it?

How much does his version cost?

Please compare the performance to the new Threadrippers from AMD.

WHERE IS THE SCREEN??

It&#39;s for Pros not for daily use lol

When you wanna upgrade this MacPro you must unplugged all the Cables at the rear side of this very nice Case. This is a very Pro Feature. Apple Design, at its best....

So this is a 35,000 dollar pc

Mark ass brownlee

I thought POWER ISA was back

I really really really need to see how this does processing Pix 4D data sets .

i was so disappointed with wow after <a href="">4:20</a>

Never been into Apple products something about them puts me off

This is a very expensive puzzle. :)

Can it run crysis.
&quot;I am going to be editing all my instagram stories on this now&quot;&quot;I love how the boxes match&quot; This video actually portrays the average apple consumer quite well. The unboxing itself shares alot with complec kids flexxing their $2000 beanie that cost $4 to make. There is 0 relatability in the actual content. The idea of making a video special was to rent RED cameras...I mean that pretty much sums how far down the rabbit hole we are going in this video.

How much is it

Test it in Minecraft with Shaders and Ray Tracing...

i have an 18 core 9980XE / 2080 TI / 128 GB RAM with water distribution block / resevior and 2 540 rads for around $6000 dollars lmfao, these  START at 6000 with 8 CORES, a cucked version of AMD graphics (no shots fired at AMD)  and 32 GB RAM, thats actually a ripoff. i have literally almost every apple product you can imagine and have not got on the hate train before but this is getting crazy, just because &quot;professionals&quot; aka a person like me that uses computers as there job are the ones buying the product does not mean that they should price gouge to such an extreme extent, macs have a great UI and rock solid stability but i cannot support a product that simply is not competitive in terms of specs / price &amp; features. wow apple just wow.

I&#39;m assuming the fans are a Apple specific apple product and will cost an arm and leg to replace.

28 cores and 384Gb of RAM. Is this for launch missile or something?

Quite and fast are what I need such as for a laptop ;)

U broke the lawIt said on box 2 people to carry and it was heavyU only carried it

<a href="">9:15</a> niiice

Does Minecraft hold up?
uploaded a new video about mac pro features and price go watch it

I actually thought it was a cheese grater.

Wait this is a computer

I legitimately thought that was a grater

Pretty good to admit, Steve sails in hell, but Apple still has IT.

Great video Soooo how many kidneys will this cost me ?

Yes hrrrm rx 580 which is 100usd used and you can get a threadripper for 500usd lmao. This pc isnt even that good

1 year later. &quot;Mac Pro is having difficulty rendering video&quot; 

<a href="">7:44</a> , the three FRANS?!?!  HAHAHA!!!

When u talk speeds and say wow, think about price and compare to windows Os and &quot;normal&quot; components at same performance lvl.  Not wow . Apple is cool new machine but overally we should compare it to other pc builds and then say Wow for speed if u get more performance with same amount of money.

Is it only me but it really looks like a cheese grater

Appreciate the Incredible True Story vinyl

The four expensive horsemen of the Moneypocalypse:The cheese grater mac proThe apple standThe xbox that looks like a PCiPhone 11 with cameras that looks like a shaver.

Yeah ... and also the cheapest and slowest memory, a triple mark-up on iron and 2 times slower going out through the 3990X quarter. This mac is just an expensive table decoration

where&#39;s the RGB?

Good

BUT CAN IT RUN MINECRAFT?!?!

I’m more impressed with the design of the tower (i.e motherboard layout, chassis, cooling solution) rather than the specs. I mean its got a last gen graphics and still fewer core than what the mainstream cpu market has to offer.

Am I the only one that gets Trypophobia from this?

Looks I have to sell myself to buy this.

can it run crisis tho?

<b>I will be able to afford this Mac Pro 13 years from now.</b>The first Mac Pro was released in 2006. They are now worth around $150 on eBay.So, in 2032, I will buy this Mac Pro (2019) for $150.I hope this makes everyone sleep better :-)

No ads weird

here are my only issue. 1. SSD replacement issue 2. space gray needed 3. once intel contract ends next year i hope apple releases a Thread ripper and leave intel trash cpu behind.other than that..this is a good product and i like it.

I was a Mac and iPhone user until I made the change to PC and Android. It was worth it.

I wonder if more RAM would improve your transcoding and render speeds...

When you realize that the upgraded one costs more than your car

Well... if you want to take a bite of the apple! Just remember...that the apple is looking quite nice, shiny, full of luxurious good taste that will satisfy you appetite. But that how the apple looking outside... if you take bite into the apple you will only taste how rotten it is, Even the worms are dead after it&#39;s poisonous pollution of it&#39;s insides. The seeds are corrupted with evil lies and they laugh at the fool... The fool is you that taken the bite of the apple. I am sorry for you...that you made this choice...

Your SSD&#39;s read, and write is almost over 3gigs, and you didn&#39;t show any real-world gaming load times... Or any gaming FPS benchmarks. I understand this isn&#39;t meant for gaming. But it&#39;s massive overkill in every single aspect. And you didn&#39;t even show any benchmarks with it.

Apple : &quot;Mac Pro is the fastest computer!&quot;Google : (Supercomputer) &quot;Allow us to introduce ourselves.&quot;

Oh shit it’s mark ass brownie with another vid!

why the apple knowing that AMD threadrippers are cheaper and faster? or even the epyc chips? ok. this is something ill never understand with people buying macs.

wheel base for Mac Pro cost $999.

Yeah but can it run Minecraft?

Looks like the machine from cloudy with a chance of meatballs

Does this mean we can play more games on mac

believe me I didn&#39;t subscribe yetCongratulations 10 Million 

Why the hell you did this you so stupiiido

Why I am watching this even I don&#39;t have money to buy it&#39;s wheel

I heard that you could buy an Audi at its price

I think it is useless beyond this point to say ur the best on the market , i really want it now

384gb ram seems a touch overkjll

Can’t wait for the apple knife 

Imagine playing flight simulator on that

you don&#39;t need that super high computer. it runs fine YouTube without high CPU. if you want to do like Hollywood CGI. stick with i7.  i9 is beta version CPU; intel say it crash a lot.... if you work on game programming. Code do change i9.

How many pop up ads can it handle 

MBP 16&quot; with eGPU enclosure with Afterburner Card. Go!

MBP 16&quot; with eGPU enclosure with Afterburner Card. Go!

This is a fake apple product. It has a headphone jack.

People from 2019 be like 384gb of Ram holy shit!!! People from my time 2049 be like hold my drink ive got 384tb of Ram LOL !!!

Apple only good for video editing and music. The rest all sucks. My brother come and flex me with his new mac pro and I tried to rub crisis 3 and it&#39;s crash and computer restart.  my rtx still better

I cannot wait for my order comes in and your next review 2020 work work work

Only 3 GB/s SSD read and write speed? My 100€ 1TB PC SSD reads and writes with 3.5 GB/s.

Mac sucks

Anyone else getting chills down their back as he so calmly explains these specs lol

<a href="">11:14</a> &quot;thanks Apple for making this&quot;Thank you Sir for giving us $5000 profits..............................................................

Whoever buys this is either braindead, rich af or got paid by Apple

Cost to Performance ratio !?....Because no one really cares of apple stickers

Would you be interested in reviewing the latest Intel nuc

Think about adding Sonnet Technologies Allegro USB A PCIe card and their M.2 4x4 PCIe gen 3.0 card - just a thought !

How fast does it download pron ? And please get a giant piece of cheese and see how good it grates it! After all if society crashes soon and all tech becomes useless you need another use for it after spending all that money :0 !

RE EISAI TRELOS RE XD
smash test

Try overclocking the cpu to 4.4 ghz, consistently for for sometime to see if if stays at the turbo speed, and if it does then is it cool enough

Test it in Corona, V-Ray or CineBench vs Windows PC on the last Ryzen Threadriper

I cannot believe that someday, this monster of a device will be considered an antique

Aligarh in short
&quot;On this 1000$ monitor stand...&quot; Wow, good thing you threw that money at Apple, instead of donating it to charity or something.

Just an overkill PC with an Apple logo. Which results in an overpriced overkill.

mkbhd&#39;s gf, I&#39;m pregnant ,I know I&#39;ve already raised it and it&#39;s in college

Mac Pro: Costs $15,000 and is insanely powerful (384GB of RAM wtf)MKBHD: These have got to be the biggest apple stickers I have ever seen

I&#39;d have to sell my house to afford this!! Lol!! Sorry Apple, but this is beyond exorbitant!

this man can end world hunger w the price of this setup

10M bruh... Congrats
Gaming test plz

Marques - How does the Mac Pro fan noise compare to the iMac Pro fan noise?  Is there any noise when rendering 4K video?Are you able to edit to the internal 4 TB hard drive, or do you use external drives or a raid?

worthless
Can&#39;t wait to see a 5000$ PC rig beat this shit

a tb3 to usb 3.0 expansion thing shouldnt be an issue of price for him though it may make his setup look less cleanthough i seriously suggest buying a base model and doing every upgrade yourself, you could buy a 2nd one with what you saved

Is it good for gaming ?

What&#39;s the price?

The best, most informative,  video I have seen to date on the Mac Pro.  As a pure amateur. I find that my iMac Pro is enough faster than is my 27&quot; iMac.I will be looking for your review of the system that you actually purchase.

Is my 32gb 3600mhz ram is joke to u?Combo with samsung evo m.2

I buy this pc and i go play Minecraft full graphics 

<a href="">9:46</a> THAT&#39;S GRATE

yeah ok it&#39;s great and all but can it run modded minecraft

Lemme guess..this is like 15kCuz even the fucking stand was 100$ so a whole pc is a nuclear power plant

Play fortnite on it

Can someone tell me if this guy is getting compensated by Apple in any way for his reviews?   I&#39;m actually interested in getting the unvarnished facts on this machine.

But will it run Crysis?

$27,599.00 oof. I don&#39;t think I could do it.

This is my first time to your channel.  Can you tell me if you are working for Apple, or, compensated in any way (by Apple) for your reviews?  Thank you.

So if I spend $20K or so for the power I want..  What is the computer scene gonna look like 4 years now?   My head is still spinning from Apples&#39; neurotic changing of usb connectors.   It looks wonderful.  I&#39;ve always been able to afford a Mac Pro, and change every few years..  Like a lot of people I use a Mac to run Logic Pro,  I don&#39;t think I can justify that amount of $$$$

overkill waste of money, could just get a razer laptop which is nicer in every way for a fraction of the price

OMG, what an ugly piece of crap lol

Glasses, that is new? Did it have anything to do with the eye trouble you where having back in November?

what a bunch of overpriced designer jewelry

So an expensive cheese grater with computer in it. Apple you can do anything!

Here is one of the quick tip, mathematically, how to calculate whether the price of mac pro is worth it. If mac pro renders the video in 4 minutes. And the imac pro is 12 minutes. That is 3 times faster. So the price of mac pro shouldnt exceed the price of 3 imac pro

Imagine getting a +$20,000 computer with 28 cores while there is an AMD threadripper with 64 cores for much less lol

giveaway?..
So at that price point wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to just buy a dedicated iMac pro for rendering?Render on one, stay productive with the other(s).

If you try to slice cheese with it, it will be Mac and Cheese

How much do you want for those apple stickers?

I mean this pc looks so cool from the inside that you could just let it open 

Who&#39;s here after he hit 10 million?

Why the mouse reciever? Isn’t the mx master bluetooth? I have the mx anywhere 2 and it is.

Designed in California........Made in China.

how about the gaming in Mac pro  compare to other gaming computers...

Best youtuber ever seen......a kind talk gentle talk love u bro...

We want to see a drop test, water test, gaming test, and cheese grade test

Look at logic in the backround hahah when i imagine that album i imagine stainless

Test it with Xcode. How are compile times

Money ways??

Grate cheese on it! (Am I the only Russian here?)
Do gaming benchmark
I can&#39;t even afford the wheels lol

Yes guys we accept you people are content creator so you are showing how useful it is for video editing, But most of the people who watch the video are not going to edit 16k video, can you make a video on what other profession the 50k mac is useful.

Test Android Studio with  its highest settings ....!

PUT AND APPLE STICKER ON YOUR CAR!!!  Lel 

UGH! That render speed is amazing! I was already very happy with the iMac Pro render-speeds but this is a whole other level!  I really wonder how fast After effects will run on this; I&#39;m sure it is going to be a blessing :) Damn Youtube; now I want one -.-

&quot;A million dollar computer&quot;
Naturally being crApple they put in a goofy artsy-fartsy box you basically destroy to open, making it harder to bring back WHEN something goes wrong. Which it will.... and the single core on that geekbench isn&#39;t exactly blowing my skirt up, with an OC I get more out of my 4770k. Now the multi, that&#39;s kind-of cool and an impressive number... until you realize how pathetic it is compared to Zen 2 threadripper especially at the price offset.But at least you get the privilege of paying three times as much for Apple to treat you like dirt.

I would like to see what Pro Res Raw does.

RIP Trypophobia

Impressive! Watching something this premium quality is a lubricant for the soul!

i bet this is provided by apple and not bought by this guyat this price i can get bewulf cluster with minimum 10 nodes and isolate them is server room and use then with virtual pc like raspberry pi 4 via sshor i can get a threadripper 3990x pc with 6x wx 5700xt , that system with crush this cheese grader(includes filter paper tho)

I&#39;ll take back my previous (waste of space) comment if you do some tests with Media Composer and your red footage. THAT would interest me.

Looks like a giant, yuuuge, heavy waste of money, tbh. Nothing apple can do at this point can redeem themselves in my eyes. Personally. Enjoy.

Can i use this pc for coding HTML ?

Wow, money&#39;s clearly not even in MB&#39;s vocabulary. I think he&#39;s lost touch with the &#39; common folk&#39;.

I wonder if they charged an extra $500 for the two biggest apple stickers ever?

Install Windows and play xd

marques is sleeping behind the mac pro right now 

Funny how that other Snazzy Labs channel is copying you.A mac channel for boomers

Yayyyy finally something built for the Chrome.

Congrats on 10m

whats the price of this config?

99% of the comments: Why would I need a $2 million gravel crusher when I can crush gravel with my $2 hammer. Also, does it play gamez? You can build a gravel crusher that crushes way more gravel for $10k.

Can you make a pc more expensive than this just doing it yourself? Buying the most expensive cpu on the planet, multiple gpus, etc.I bet you cant tho

im usually an aple hater but i like dis

is the xeon w he mentioned the overclockable version?

useful for running games..............? AT  8K please

Fusion 360 save as stl import into slic3r for 3D printing

The CPU must have been blazin hot to by the time it finished that render time...

Does that cost more than airpods

Nice one bro
MKBHD is bornMKBHD: So I&#39;ve been living for the past 2 weeks and here&#39;s what I think.

I&#39;m not a fan of apple, but holy fuck that pc looks good on the inside. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.

With everything maxed out including a monitor and stand your total is only $71,329.61 before tax. With probably $5,000 worth of materials.

The inside looks cool as hell Id just keep the shell off 

Why the does it has 384 GB of RAM you will never use these 384 gb and probably not even the halfI mean &quot;normal&quot; high end PCs have like 64 GB and thats more than you would ever need

Hi!

the shitty design is back as well! :)))

Nice Bitcoin miner.
52,199$ can turn you poor overnight , it&#39;s a really fast machine!

How does can that processor help in photo editing.....?????for the full review.

He on 9.99 mil Get marques to 10 mil 
Install windows and Run Crisis 

guys, is the incredible true story thing in the  back shelf a vinyl?

How much did your Mac Pro cost out the door after tax?

How much does it worth for ya

I think this is the most expensive cheese grinder

First congratulations for 10 millon subscribe . 
But can you print?

pffff in a month we will have as always o pc twice as powerfull for less than half the price

Bought a $760 pc with about 6 usb ports

Could you show us how it handles the full Adobe Suite like Lightroom and premiere and bridge all at once?

This shit must run everything smoothly

INCREDIBLE initial review. Love that you&#39;re straight to the point. Great review man!

Use Resolve 16, Rendering is ALWAYS faster than the video. Use it on the Mac Pro, it will probably happen faster than you sneeze.

i  dig the soundtracks

Wow Marques! Almost 10 Millions! Congrats!

marques : &quot;keep an eye on dust&quot;also marques : *proceeds to enter finger into the cheese grater

Apple: 28 cores!AMD: weakling.
It&#39;s the ugliest computer I&#39;ve ever seen. A fuckin $300 build looks better. You can probably build a $10k PC that&#39;s better than the most expensive config of the Mac pro

give it to me

Ok, now compare it with the new threadripper with 2x2080ti(or better the Titan RTX) with the max amount of ram the board can take GEN 4 M.2 and then do a price comparisson... I think it will be less than 20.000$ and you get bettter productivity. Waste of money.

Comes with all facilities. Floor heaterAir blower with 3+1 fans Cheese grater

By my rough calculations, the setup we see in the video with the 2 monitors and skipping the nanotexture glass will only set you back $43,000. With the nanotexture glass is another $2k on top to take it to $45,000. Mac PRO indeed. Consumers and enthusiasts need not apply. This is a machine meant to make money off of.  Or at least that seems to be what Apple&#39;s thinking is here.

This is something i never could buy, so maybe you will take a win iMAC game in 10 Years then i would love to win it. Peace

It would be so nice if those wallpapers would panoramically line up! :)

I’d love to see how this machine performs with motion graphics and VFX productions workflows. How would it perform using 3D programs and render engines like Cinema 4D, Redshift, Octane and Arnold?Great video. Looking forward to more of your tests with the new machine. Looks like a beast, but primarily catering to video editors.

But can it play Crysis on ultra ?

The legend says that you didn&#39;t even touch the power button that it&#39;s already switch on.

Another overpriced pos apple product

Another gadget the 1% can afford.

would love to see the cost break down of the specs your gonna get.

Hey MKBHD 10M soon time&#39;s coming to reveal &#39;K&#39;

Price ?

Are you hiring

Whichever way you look at it, they ain&#39;t ever gonna be as good as a top-end PC...

At <a href="">9:16</a>– 420 baby

peace yo !

Guys,this computer is not made for people that use the computer for watching YouTube or browsing through Amazon,this computer is made for profesinal editors,for people who actually need that processing power,and for them it’s 100% worth it.And it’s relatively cheap compared to other setups,even if it costs more than your car multiplied by 5.

Small price to pay for an electronic cheese grater

i bought mac mini i3 2018 and i have mouse lag -_- with wired mouse Rival 600 is that how MacOS works?

i love how you buy thing that you need rather than things that you like

Wait? What?

yes hello markass brownie
The computer ever

It&#39;s a grater my dude

Is it normal that I can smell the smell of this unboxing @ <a href="">2:30</a> ? :D

Yet it still runs fortnite with lag

Mkbhd: Hi! Ive been editing my videos on mobile with my Mac Pro for a while now.

$53kJustified?No single pc should be worth more than 5 cars

Can it run fortnite though? Lmao

This thing has more RAM than I’ve ever had in all my computers in total, and I’ve been buying PC’s since 96!! SMH!!

Absolute garbage. You can build a PC 1k cheaper and have everything, and I mean everything better

How many Google Chrome tabs can it handle tho? :D

Lol I thought that was an iOS cheese shredder

You are too fucking rich
Is it good to play PUBG?

Can I play GTA Vice City in Mac Pro?

Can you please test it for gaming

Try gaming on it

It&#39;s absolutely beautiful with the outer aluminium shroud removed!

$32,000, not including the monitors...  Damn velcro makes it expensive.

i want fps review on gaming , like why not?

I don’t follow this channel but this was on my feed. Totally thought it was a cheese grater

da fak ! :O Do they actually giving magic keyboard and mouse absolutely FREE with Mac Pro ! They could&#39;ve sell it separately ! Amazing Apple &lt;3 Also they are giving Power cable, User Manual and two &quot;Biggest&quot; apple logo stickers etc worth at least 200$ - 300$ !

Marques: I have just gotten the 8-core Mac Pro delivered.  I&#39;m curious as to the model number of the CPU in the 28 core version.  Can you run the following command to see the CPU model information on your machine?sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_stringOn mine it returns:Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-3223 CPU @ 3.50GHz

there are going to be people who leave the plastic wrap on the front and back cuz they want to &quot;protect&quot; it, and accidentally choke the system of air until it overheats.

Cheese grater pro max
Jesus Apple, if you&#39;re going to make world class workstation desktop... could you maybe give us some more port diversity? Hell even my basic bitch gaming PC that cost like 1/50 of this thing has a greater selection of port types.

What&#39;s even the point of having that much RAM? Outside of like running 20 different virtual machines or having it as a server, I don&#39;t really get it lol. Does really help video editing and 3d rendering that much?

I have one of these. They really help me grade my <b>cheese!</b>

config : core 2 duo , 4gb ram ddr3 , hd 256gb, power supply 400w,integrated graphics,  all that for only 7k ....good job mate !

Can it run Crysis tho?

His House is Huge  
can you do a 3D render test using Autodesk Maya, Blender, Cinema 4D and/or Unity? Thanks. I would love to see that

4.5K   Haters in Life

The fck that too clean

I know he did not just complain about only having two USB ports

It has 384 GB RAM..a wow it’s useless..

Ryzen 3rd Gen Hackintosh vs Mac Pro
I can get rid of my heel calluses on the front of that thing.  Yeah I said it.

I think at the end he&#39;s like, &quot;Do I really need another cheese grater in my life?&quot;

*F   L   E   X*
It&#39;s going to look great with your CyberTruck!

wait for smartphone awards 2019
where&#39;s your shirt from? not even kidding. genuine question

MKBMKBHDMKB4KMKB8K RAW

For thorough full review play CS:GO and Fortnite to prove it&#39;s worth.

You will never ever use that much RAM, there’s simply so need to have so much

If you could, in the full review try to do a collab with LTT and ask them to build a comparable rig with the new threadripper, try to keep everything same i.e. ram, graphics except the processor and see how both of them compare.I mean if one is not going to use fcp then is there any point in getting a mac pro with ridiculously priced intel xeon...Because if not, then it just ends up being an overkill best designed for fcpThats something I&#39;d love to be answered..

Who came here because of Rick and Morty episode s04e05???

I would like a Mac Pro but now I have something that is even better  that cost 3,5 times less :) I just got my Workstation computer with  Xeon 2288G 8 core (5Ghz max turbo, 4,7 with all 8 cores running 100%). It is almost identical  to the basic Mac Pro only with faster CPU and 1TB M.2... And it can run Mac OS as Hackintosh out of the box using clover no fuss install lol.

I want one
Hope till morning, You got 10 Million Subscribers as well , Advance Congratulations

Is the ”Youtube rewind 2021”- review coming out this week?

But can you game in it?

Thank you for a level headed review Marques! Now that some will be watching your videos in 6K, can you please upload your reviews in 8K HDR (since 6K videos uploads are not recognized by YouTube) Cheers!

i be like watching a porn star that never i&#39;ll have :d

quality is sprouting everywhere

Apple suk

Anyone have a link to the gorgeous wallpaper he&#39;s using?

I&#39;m surprised Apple even give you the cable with it at this point.

<a href="">5:20</a> who observed that middle black part is shakingIllusion

wait.. you do cooking now?
I&#39;m not an Apple fan, but that machine is beautiful.

damn that 300+ GB of RAM...

If I&#39;m a video editor I&#39;ll go for more VRAM than of normal ram

Can you stop giving those shitty apples products credits and tell people to buy windows laptop instead of this cheap plastic and low performance laptop

Who want a vid of his apartment??Hit thumbs up!!

desperately waiting for you to reach 10 million......You are my favourite

Amazing 
if onlycould takeI am disabledİPHONE 11 PRO MAX 256 GB  I want

This guy literally bought 368 gb ram worth computer to use mothefucking FINAL CUT PRO BRUHHHH, you cant get dumber than this, one of the most basic and bottom of the line editing software, atleast use premiere or after effects, what the fuck????

It looks like a fucking cheese grater lol

Waiiiittttt one thing because i hate u thats NOT the fastest &quot;pc&quot;

Interesting advertisement video for an overpriced computer that has lot&#39;s a power and is ugly, on top of that what I like about this video is: Yes you have lots of headroom to edit your video with this machine!(Almost 30K$ for this setup). short version is, how to waste 30K$ on an ugly machine when you can simply buy parts separately and come up with a much more beautiful and flexible setup later that you can easily upgrade or change over time, at least you could put this Computer in some Animation rendering to demonstrate a bit more value not just &quot;Video Editing&quot; the advertisement just went horribly wrong here. IMO waste of money.

what about display port

so overpriced.

fuck you
The only question I have have is what is your ideal simultaneous editing? Can it work through your perfect world edit/export. 4 8K videos at the same time, 8 videos, 10+. Are there any restrictions that you are still going through? 100+ apps open, 4 simultaneous 8K editing, 2 VM going, 3 Xcode’s going, 100,000 tabs+. Sidecar.

Still cost way to much for what it is. But to each their own.

I would love to see how this thing performs on gaming

<a href="">6:14</a> are those the 2016 banneds?

So that&#39;s what can run Microsoft flight simulator 2020

It has a headphone jack!!!!

But can it grate cheese?

&quot;chat with you guys in the next one. Peace! ️&quot;<b>turns camera to reveal Cybertruck</b>&quot;What you didn&#39;t know is I&#39;ve been driving this bad boy for the last two weeks&quot;

Thank you apple for making an UPGRADABLE computer again... now please let us upgrade the &quot;PRO&quot; mabcooks and imacs  instead of soldering the stinking ram down!!!!

Apple actually delivers a fair price for this! This is a first.

test it for gaming

It&#39;s impressive that they found space for a headphone jack..

Max cost for this computer is truly $53,000!!!!! See the site.

Can I play modern warfare in it

Try to play games high res recommended

compared to the 2013 Macpro, this one just sucks. To cram into a box is stupid iron.  No ideas, no concept , no anything except the desire to make money.

in 5 years it will cost 500 bucks

This is actually an old video.Since then, the Mac Pro has exploded and Marques is lying there dead, waiting for someone to notice the smell of rotting flesh.

Can you do a test for me? I have a pretty loaded Mac Pro 2013 and want to know if there is an adapter that can run the display from it? Technically it&#39;s not supported but curious if it will work. Seems less daunting to upgrade one at a time at this price point.

its apple bro,you can buy a phone with 1300$ with 4GB ram..

<a href="">9:18</a> wow the MAC PRO did <a href="">4:20</a> :P how about try that buying a costume windows PC with just 1500$ you will see its gonna be so much stronger than this... :)

LOL they can&#39;t keep up anymore. It&#39;s just a cult at this point.
