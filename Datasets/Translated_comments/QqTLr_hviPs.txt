Lack of knowledge Pant Pratinidhi is itself higher position than Pant Pradhan (peshwa), why would pant pratinidhi downgrade his position from being 2nd to 3rd

Hello / hi !!! I m Gunjan Newaskar this side!!! I wish to dedicate this iconic historic scene to the three people who have influenced my life 01) The greatest allrounder GOAT one &amp; only Gaurav Malhotra urf Dewas Palty He was from Dewas his father used to work at Avery high  respected position in the Bank Note Press (BNP) of India He is a Jat by religion so bravery is in his religion, caste &amp; creed by birth he was very hot blooded but he was not sanki / short tempered!!! He always used his mind over his heart he was good with the good &amp; very very bad to the bad. He was so brave &amp; daring &amp; solid that all people used to fear him, even the seniors also,  but he was also loving, smart, handsome, super sexy, rough &amp; tough, gentle &amp; humble at the same time!!! His interests included music, mathematics, poetry, drawing &amp; arts, sexy khubsurat, haseen, nazneen, pariyon jaisi sundar hot mast chodu maal ladkiyon ko chedna / eve teasing karna etc badtameezi, all of us used to enjoy his company i still remember he used to play mouth organ like sound with a hair comb also he used to play dotodrums he &amp; his voice was so man nish he was very much masculine girls used to fap on him I met him in Savita college batch of 1999-2003 he was also very good in academics/ studies also he got 98/100 marks in mathematics in XII standard ee was a very loving &amp; smart person and a humble &amp; noble guy but he was very vulgar &amp; obscene he used to make dirty &amp; nasty comments about girls he used to do dirty non veg jokes all the time I personally hail him as the greatest champion he was good in sports &amp; athletics as well he used to play cricket &amp; volleyball he presently works as a Delivery Manager in TCS Germany &amp; is married to a beautiful absolutely ravishing drop dead gorgeous woman it&#39;s a love marriage his wife our bhabhi used to work in TCS as well he has two very beautiful cute pretty daughters he lives in Munich, Germany !!!  Salute to him he is still alive he is a living legend &amp; am ideal example for all of the young generation 2) The GOAT manager (now CEO) one &amp; only

If Peshwa Bajirao lived for even 10 years more and Madhavrao survived till 40, Maratha Empire would&#39;ve reached Iran and Afghanistan and they probably wouldn&#39;t have lost the third battle of Panipat too.

Who is waiting for RANBIR KAPOOR, ALIAA BHATT, VICKY KAUSHAL, &quot;LOVE &amp;WAR&quot; 

Better than arjun kapoor

<a href="">4:07</a> his brightness look, shines in his eyes, feels ghoosbhumbs.......

Babijao is great but why had to love mastani.......though if he did.....we didn&#39;t imagine the pain of Kashi Bai.....we felt goosebumps just watching this but it had happened in real life....

Jai Ho Brahman YodhaJai Sri Parshuram
Movie start hone k time Dailouge aha he

All rajputs jaats and gurjars should realize that he is the most successful warrior of modern india.jai parshuram

My father is big officer all of say your are bad boy ..But reality to scene 

The scene is dramatized very effectively but why did ranveer singh did not do namaskar/mujra to chatrapati when he arrives. Dont you think it is insult of chatrapati.

<a href="">3:00</a> Better than Adipurush 

best scene

Love this scene and Bajirao&#39;s entrance. Ranveer is spectacular!!

DELHI TERI MAA BHEE GAYEE HAI HAI KABHI. DOGS.
Prior to this movie...I never thought that Ranveer Singh would ever make it A list Actors. Ranveer Singh nailed it.Hats Off to Sanjay Leela Bhansali for creating such an amazing story of a Warrior - Bajirao Mastani

My name is to the great king of all worlds.
Shahu ji maharaj .
For those who thinks, why does a politician like Pant claimed  a Peshwa post and king didn‚Äôt protested, because like Bhat family, the Pant family were also famous in Maratha politics. Sripat rao Pant was a capable military general also his father Pershuram trimbak were both Peshwa and Pant.

07/12/1987

This is something different

One of best scene in indian cinema. Of all time.

Om smile 
Seeing this scene literally gives me goosebumps

Om Namah Shivaya Ô∏è
This whole design was made by Nitin Desai, RIP.

The people here are of the same class as a Brahmin whereas Bajirao was a Kashtri by work. It is written in Geeta that the life of a human being is the Pradhan of his work and not the Pradhan of his caste. Geeta is our supreme scripture and I agree with it. All those who supported Bajirao were Brahmins. Those who supported Bajirao's army with their blood, their deeds and caste were lost. That the third corner of Brahmanwad did not fall. The Brahmin alone did not eat the food. They got this empire as a result of the sacrifice and sacrifice of all the Maratha people. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and who knows how many Marathas have sacrificed their blood for this soil. Only one Bajirao has not eaten the Maratha Empire.
Ô∏èWARNINGÔ∏èShameless Converts in this comment section have no shame and are defending the same Mughal bastards that r@*ed their Great great Grandma&#39;s and butchered their Forefathers and converted them!Have they no common sense?Their Hindu ancestors must be rolling in their Graves!

Best one

Peek Ranvir
My husband, Ranveer, is the most handsome
Woooow dialogue proud to be a part of this cultural heritage

Bajirao has to prove himself to become peshwa

Mahesh voice is damn suitable 
Ajinkay sir vale like karoo faas ;)
For only one arrow?? 

Can&#39;t believe this guy is now acting in movies like Cirkus and Jayesh Bhai Jordar

EPIC
I am Karnataka and chatrapati shivaji maharaj is in my heart

I am a Muslim bt blood boils when see this movie

A movie which could have emerged with very dangerous content but by giving it the name of Pyaar Mohabbat, did not show Bajirao as impressive who was more powerful, brave and intelligent in front of whom even the best Mughal Sardars could not stand.
Proud to be born on sanatan
Ô∏èüáÆüá≥Ô∏èJai Ho Ô∏èüáÆüá≥Ô∏è
Here,  Peshwa is not doing his original job! Ranveer has enacted this role very well! but the history is incorrect!

One of the greatest leader from mratha empire 

I, m proud to be a brahmin 

Remember that moment when watching this scene and listening to the bgm in theatre 

He died in 40 so sad

We Do not have leaders like Bajirao today.............That is why India is suffering.............

When I was looking at the comment section, I liked that all the blind people are jealous. In the film itself, they are shown as brave. You are saying this, oh brother, if you say this then you are a fool. Go and check History, you half-lully people.
This is the kind of focus you need to crack IIT-JEE

This is what happened. Bajirao Mastani.
Better if he would have been acted in prithviraj chauhan film....but offcourse let&#39;s see what Akshay kumar does....

What he is wearing in this scene?

Milind and Ranveer chemistry beautiful in Movie 

U all are only brave in movies...in reality  mughals  put arse to ur ass specially aurangzeb the great

Love to Marathas from Rajputana. My ancestral clan is from jaisalmer, rajasthan and probably migrated to maharashtra when the invasions started in rajasthan and I have spent my whole life in maharashtra in a small town and I grew up hearing kirtans in mathas and playing with my friends who were all marathi and I never felt like I didn&#39;t belong.Jai maharashtra Jai shivaji.

This scene is a masterpiece.

Jai Peshwa Bajirao Ballal BhatHar Har Mahadev
His entry is like Lion.

Milind Soman...the real Hindu man chariot...

Best actor

This is a beautiful film. Indeed their love was very powerful and consuming, but just my 2 cents worth surely a true love and pure love is meant to lift up and inspire if you divide&#39;s and courses terrible and deep wounds. Such as Bajirao&#39;s first wife is it true? this love divided people into fractions shouldn&#39;t love also be in the sense sacrificing and not just wanting its own way but also taking into consideration of others and also one&#39;s duty. This man appeared to be a master of the battlefield and I didn&#39;t even know that swords could have those kinds of blades Of course, I watched this film with purely western eyes and find this movie equally beautiful as well sad and moving (Black chick who loves Indian movies)

Probably the best entrance in Bollywood. Ô∏è‚Äç

No one like marathas

When you think about chatrapati shivaji maharaj automatically you feel energetic 
Mujra of honor to the rich Bajirao Peshwa
Haryana has significant number of Martha population ,which came as pilgrims before third battle of Panipat.

Har Har Mahadev 
After watching movie Bajirao - Mastani, people even if Peshwa Bajirao&#39;s deedsBe a follower but it is an unbreakable truth that the rule of Peshwao was the most painful and humiliating period for the untouchables. Brahminism was so extreme in the rule of Peshwao that untouchables were not allowed to walk on the road. If someone walked on untouchable road, he would have to hang a clay pot around his neck. Untouchables were not allowed to spit on the ground, by doing so the ground became unholy. He could not spit on the ground, so he had to walk with a pot hanging around his neck. He had to walk with a broom behind him so that no Brahmin would fall on his footsteps and he would not be unholy. They had to walk with a bell in their hand or something making noise so that the Brahmins could hear the information of walking in their path and Brahmins would move out of their way.Fed up with this inhuman atrocities of Peshwa, Maharashtra&#39;s Maharo joined the English army and defeated the army of Peshwa Bajirao badly. Only 500 Maharas dusted 25000 soldiers of Peshwa Bajirao II in the battle fought in Koregaon on 1 January 1818. In this war, the Mahar Regiment of the British East India Company destroyed the army of Peshwa Bajirao. Koregaon&#39;s War Memorial is a sign of the amazing strength of the Mahar race. The atrocities that Peshwa did on untouchables during his regime, there was a t

This part is one of the best scenes ever watched. The background music, roles played by Ranveer truly made it epic.

Hindu Swaraj
Can we just appreciate the music in background from <a href="">2:28</a> to rest of the video just hear it clearly close eyes dont see video only hear the sound . You will get to know what i am talking about.

Mast scene hain.
Bajirao&#39;s test is my favourite part in the whole film. Peshwa Bajirao was a genius. I have seen this part 100 times.

Literal goosebumps

Jai hindurashtra 
Parnam Jai Hind Sir

The special thing about Maratha which made him different from Rajputo and Jeetya..in his mind lachak (not just bravery) and jaggery to make everyone happy.
This is what we would miss in Akshay&#39;s Prithviraj.....a rock solid lead!!

chatrapati promised  bhadur shah 1 that he will never attack mughals so this sccene is misleading

Everything was great until Mastani entry 

He is brilliant actor 

That score though!!!

What a actor he is...!!!Marathi Accent tak Pakad lia bhai ne ..

Saw the trailer of Padmavat so went ahead.
In starting who is saying that dialogue at starting who is the name of that character in movie

Har Har Mahadev

The best thing in this video was the bgm

it wouldve been better agar pankh gir gaya hota !!!

In 2021, whenever I see this scene I will get goosebumps.

Wow...

He said woh mayur pankh hai mughal saltanat ka pedh ??? Since when peacock feathers started growing on trees ?

The way Ranveer has worked hard to look, talk and convince like a marathi... Is just admirable. He did it. I am impressed

Maratha Empire 

Confidance level

Entry music is damn good

Our land, our rule, Chhatrapati Shivaji's only dream, Hindu Swaraj 
Very nice movie

Marathas and then Peshwas saved India...  Otherwise India would have been a Muslim Majority Nation... It is our Nation...  Nation of Hindus.. Of course we have been merciful enough to let people of other religions live... But some religions wanted to change this

lets take a moment to appreciate the cinematic prowess and culture that was expressed in this scene.

Epic scene

This movie should have included more content from his bravery but they included more from love side

At <a href="">1:13</a> What a laugh Pantpratinadhi ji, you are laughing alone.

Epic Scene. What did Peshwa's enemies say?
jab tak rajput or maratha bhaiyo hai tab tak mughal lo ka sans lena hi haram tha jay bhavani..har har mahadev!!!

Unfortunately all maratha leaders who were capable died at a very young age Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the age of 50Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj at the age of 31Peshwa Bajirao I at the age of 39Peshwa Madhavrao at the age of 27

&quot;Ranveer Has To Prove Himself To Become Peshwa&quot; Buddy, Ranveer doesn&#39;t have to prove, its Bajirao who needs to prove. At least name the title properly. Its not the actor whom you&#39;re making the story of, its the young Bajirao who&#39;s story is being told.

This movie is insulting Baji rao

<a href="">0:48</a> gossebumps üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥

That background music gave me goosebumps

Hail Bajirao, he was a Brahmin warrior who never lost a war. We are proud of Bajirao. Jai Hind.

best try bajirao

Jai Ho Baji

The irony of this scene is Aditya Pancholi (non-brahmin) looks exactly like a Chitpavan brahmin in terms of fair complexion and light coloured eyes while Milind Soman who&#39;s actually a Chitpavan himself doesn&#39;t look like one.

Baji Rao was better than Any other Hindu king.

What happened?
Milind Soman Ô∏è
Each n every shot of this pic is iconic......

Awesome

He is not Ranveer in the movie he is Bajirao!!!! Then why to write in the title &#39;Ranveer&#39;?????

what do you say
what a dualouge

I don&#39;t like this movie

Thanks Sanjay Leela Bhansali for touching this chapter of Maratha history and introducing the great Srimant Bajirao Peshwa not only to the world but many Indians as well.Most history books have a few paragraphs on Maratha history and don&#39;t even mention the name of Bajirao Peshwa.Maratha empire was at it&#39;s zenith in the 18th century and the credit largely goes to Bajirao peshwa who captured half of India in a span of 20 years and won all the 40 battles he fought. He was not just a lovesick person but one of the most valiant warrior not just India but the world has ever seen.

Faster than a boat faster than lighting we are the pooootiiiiisssss shakira

Its not ranveer its baji rao

I dont like bajirao. I am fan of madhavrao. The most ethical as well as invincable peshwa. Even british said if madhavrao lived mire years britush would be finished in india. Madhavrao died at 27 age due tb.

The cruel and despicable mentality of Khilji and Mughals has been depicted slightly, but accurately.
Sense of indian youth. Bajirao is great man no doubt he loved a woman that is also fine.But on other hand allahuddin did same but shown in wrong way.Jaago india jaago. Not everything is truth what we see by our eyes. This is the result of diverting india youth mind. No harsh feeling for Respected Bajirao and not for Allahuddin. Try to undrstand things you wont be caught in such harmful mind wash movies.

Ranveer&#39;s Hardwork 
why the title says &quot;ranveer&quot; .. ranveer thoda bana tha peshwa .. bajirao likna chahiye tha ..

Paanipat Movie made to show how Ranveer is better than Arjun Kapoor

Almost it was fake movie. .. 90% fake storie....

I wish my boss introduces me like this to his boss :D :D

Swami is King

Mana ki tum bollywood walon ke rag-rag mein islam basta hai par tag line sahi karo Its not Ranveer trying to prove rather &quot;Bajirao trying to prove....&quot;

Wish this movie was about his greatness as a soldier

Make a movie of Chatrapati Sivaji Maharaj and the lead actor will be Sharad Kelkar.
Mongols were scared mostly of Maratha domination.  It is true. Even Biharis (JP Narayan)  were scared of Maratha domination.  This is the Bhagva dhwaj (Saffron Flag) not the Hara dhwaj (Green Flag). This is a good Peshwa.

This wise fool is a hypocrite since birth and is against Muslims.

Eight hundred years of slavery is just a fake narrative and nothing else. This is simply a fake narrative or propaganda used by the enemies to try to gain a psychological edge over the Hindus. The Greatest Marathas The Greatest Marathas (Hindus) defeated and destroyed the evil and demonic Mughals since the 1640s and since then the Hindus of Western India (Maharashtra and other states) and the Hindus of South India have been defeated by the Greatest Marathas of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Liberated under leadership. Later, the Hindus of North India and Eastern India were also liberated by the great Marathas and the Maratha Empire (Hindu Empire). The Maratha Empire (Hindu Empire) was established, popularly known as Hindavi Swaraj (Hindu self-rule, Hindu self-rule). So next time if any Non-Hindu tells any Hindu about 800 years of slavery, just tell them the above sentence. If they don't believe, tell them to search Mughal-Maratha_Wars on Wikipedia which clearly states Decisive Maratha Victory. Jai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Har Har Mahadev, Jai Shri Ram 
Buster are rules in bollywood

Doe&#39;s not matter ranbir&#39;s acting , it was a anti Hindu film, be so shame .

Achha maratha log kabhi mughalo ke virudhh jeet kyun nahi pay??? Not trolling just asking cuz i dont know and i wanna know

Not Ranveer, you fool?

Title is wrong as who the hell Ranveer is. It the Bajirao. Who is proving to become Peshwa  Ranveer is no one. Against the maharaja Peshwa.

Om

The cinematography .... Direction is of hollywood level, or shall i say more better than hollywood.

I love shiva g

A movie that is a blot to the name of Baji Rao and the Rao family as a whole. Bollyturd must keep to just making criminal and raunchy movies, based on its first hand experience of being a hovel of criminals and couch shakers.

Every frame of this movie is poetry in motion

I just think that he ruined his life by a dalliance with mastani. He had a plan, a future, a loving wife, strong children, the respect of his people, his soldiers and his peers. It almost seems as if mastani was sent to sabotage him.

Copied and pasted so it doesn&#39;t get lost in comment sectionJames Grant Duff in his &quot;History of Mahrattas&quot;:

It may be truly said that, Bajirao had both, head to plan and hand to execute.



Jadunath Sarkar says in his forward to ‚ÄúPeshwa Bajirao I and Maratha Expansion‚Äù



‚ÄúBajirao was a heaven born cavalry leader. In the long and distinguished galaxy of Peshwas, Bajirao Ballal was unequalled for the daring and originality of his genius and the volume and value of his achievements. He was truly a carlylean Hero as king- or rather as Man of action.‚Äô If Sir Robert Walpole created the unchallengeable position of the Prime Minister in the unwritten constitution of England, Bajirao created the same institution in the Maratha Raj at exactly the same time.



Sir R. Temple says in ‚ÄúOriental Experiences‚Äù:



‚ÄúBajirao was hardly to be surpassed as a rider and was ever forward in action, eager to expose himself under fire if the affair was arduous. He was inured to fatigue and prided himself on enduring the same hardships as his soldiers and sharing their scanty fare. He was moved by an ardour for success in national undertakings by a patriotic confidence in the Hindu cause as against its old enemies, the Muhammadans and its new rivals, the Europeans then rising above the political horizon. He lived to seethe Maratha spread over the Indian continent from the Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. He died as he lived in camp under canvas among his men and he is remembered among the Marathas as the fighting Peshwa, as the incarnation of Hindu energy.



British General Bernerd Montgomery in his Concise History of Warfare :



They(Marathas) were at their best in the eighteenth century, and the Palkhed campaign of 1727-28 in which Baji Rao I outgeneralled Nizam-ul-Mulk, is a masterpiece of strategic mobility.

The Undefeated Maratha Warrior 
I&#39;m tamilan But I like maratha very much
His name is Bajirao not Ranveer

It‚Äôs Bajirao, not Ranveer, who had to prove himself...

Seen 1k times Dialogues 
I watch most of the timeBecause I love historyJay hind üáÆüá≥

peshwas  cunningly and deceptively overthrew the ruler , i.e the CHATRAPATI . They portrayed Shahu Chatrapati as an idiot child, but the reality is they wanted to rule . Wrong history is purposely being still taught  in schools

Great attitude by ranveer

Madaboard addict............ ........ You are not even worthy of acting like Bajirao, he is worthless.

All the chieftains of Chhatrapati like the commander, minister, Peshwa, Sarnobat, Subedar and other chieftains together expanded the Maratha Empire. We are proud of those warriors. Subedar Tanhaji, Peshwa Bajirao, General Commander Hambirrao Mohite, Sardar Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Tofkhana chief Daulat Khan and alll

Great Jai Bajirao Peshwa Pratham , Ranveer Singh is a great actor Ô∏è
Peshwa Bajirao was the most brave and fearless and much more powerful than Maharana Pratap
Bajirao serve the Maratha Empire for 20 years and he never lose any battle

Because of marathas, south of india had less invasions. Thank you.

Jai Parsuram
Na peshwa like brahmin maujud hai ab or maharana pratap like kshtriya isle sanatan ka bad haal ab ,we need revival very soon before it's too late
Without sun rays...without fragrance of air...and bollywood...is incomplete without Ranveer Singh...!!
Hail Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
From Marathe Baloch to Haryana till our sword is based, who went so far to fight the war.
500 Mahar army had killed 25000 Maratha army and 3000 horsemen, in Chamkaur 40 religious Sikhs killed 10 lakh Mughal and Rajput army, then 13 battles were fought by Rajputs against Sikhs and in the 14th battle Rajputs along with Mughals. Rajput Maratha fought against Sikhs and lost all the battles.
There is no actor like Ranveer
Nice

Character less
Only he can do justice to this role and he did it 

The age of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj is 38 years old when Bajirao became Peshawa. In the film Maharaj seems like 60 years old man. Another mistake of the film.

One of the best scenes of Indian cinema

Ohhh... That&#39;s perfect , &quot;BAJIRAO BALAAL&quot; !!!!!. Thank god.

In the Madrasa. Maulvi: - Quran has been given to all the children. Akram, tell me what is written in the Quran? Akram: - Muslims are hypocrites. Angry Maulvi: - Tell me how? Akram: - It is written in the Quran that Muslims Women come out of the house in burqa but Sania Mirza roams around the world half naked. It is written in the Quran that Muslim women cannot watch TV but in Akrubuddin Owaisi's house everyone watches item songs on TV. It is written in the Quran that Muslims Girls should not go to school but the girls of Azam and Oweshi go to big schools. It is written in the Quran that Muslim women cannot dance but hundreds of heroines like Shabana Azmi, Farah Khan are dancing half naked. In the Quran It is written that one should go for Haj with one's own earnings, but in India, Muslims go for Haj with the income of infidels. Maulvi getting angry: - You fool, it seems that you are the illegitimate child of some infidel. Akram: - Sir, that is us. Everyone knows that we all Muslims are children of infidels.
I only get one thing.... Ranveer nailed each scene perfectly with his expressions, acting and tune....while deepika can&#39;t do proper expression like Priyanka or Ranveer

Bajirao was lucky he wasn&#39;t asked for 6 years of experience working under a Peshwa

Only chattrapati should have succeeded the throne The votebank system between peshwas and Chatrapati is very weakend As later peshwas were very corrupted and castist not compared as elder peshwas This weakened Maratha empire very badly

It&#39;s the time to check which YouTube channel and their members are  how much helpful for this kranti... thanku

Worst direction and acting

Please all this movies are bullshit

Epic epic epic

Ranveer Singh did not justice to the Peshwa role.Peshwas were prime minister&#39;s.Ranveer looked cheap.Overacting.

If I reborn I would like to be as a Marathi

Wondedful expression of all the characters

Imagine Shushant Singh Rajput in this role

Ranveer or Bajirao?
Dislike Mughal's son
Whats the sound when he arrive!???? What instrument is that?????

You don‚Äôt have to agree with me but I think Milind Soman should have played Bajirao.  He definitely would have looked the part, has the charm and personality. All he‚Äôd need to have is the marathi accent. There is so much of unused potential there

Samrat Asoka, Akbar, Chhatrapati Shivaji - India desperately needs a leader who is an amalgamation of these three great kings. They were the true benchmarks of the word INDIAN. History never lies, India prospered under their reign.

Long live Peshwa Bajirao.
I salute Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Long live Chhatrapati Shambhaji Maharaj.
Sheepeater's ass..
Really that‚Äôs so big scene

After 2 doses of weeds effect...druggist

Bajirao I is one of the greatest generals that the world has ever seen.. respected by even by the British army generals who criticized India for being so divided. Bajirao can be compared to Alexander for being young and being one with his men on frontlines but just leave it to bollywood to waste such an opportunity to create a classic military movie and degrade it to a love story

Can someone please explain the issue between peshwa and mahars? Something related to the last rites of Sambhaji? Please explain the recent bhima koregaon case

Ranveer Singh is the best actor for historical films

Jokar h sala

Bajirao Peshwa was a great warrior 
This thing can also lead to civil war

I am imagining SSR in the scene, he would have done magic and created history

I am eagerly waiting for a movie about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj..... Jai Bhagwa Swaraj

Shouldn&#39;t the title be &quot;Bajirao has to prove himself&quot;??????

And now what&#39;s happening to Bollywood is maratha pride is hurt finally... Drugs, underworld, mafia, politicians, nepotism..

Bajiav did not show Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj doing Mujra.

Don't doubt Ranveer Singh's acting from now on, he can beat you anytimeWhy would he die?
This Scene is better than Entire Panipat movie

Salute to Maratha patriots on behalf of Rajputs.
Jai mratha

31 million views? only Ranveer can do this

Bajirao Peshwa name he is quite
A little Correction:Bajirao has to prove himself to become Peshwa and not Ranveer

If Panipat had not been lost, a Marathi man would definitely have been the Pant Pradhan in Delhi today
Amazing music and dialogue

Ranveer&#39;s accent is 100%spot on

My god that archery technique is just so bad

This has to be the best movie and scene of all time RS killed it

I have come here to imagine ssr in this role....bloody Bollywood RIG (rot in grave)

Are you also going to dislike it? Justice for sushant singh rajput.
Bajirao was youngest and most successful warrior after Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj

Our Earth, Our King Chatrapati Shivaji's one dream HINDU SWARAJ Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è When he heard this, he started crying and bowed his head in front of Shivaji Maharaj. Shivaji Maharaj saw this dream when almost pure India was under Islamic rule. It was said that no one could think like this but Shivaji Maharaj thought and did it. Those Marathes were the ones who marched ahead and left the Mughals in Delhi. In history, every threat came to the Hindu religion, Mother India gave birth to a lion like Shivaji Maharaj who once again gave birth to God. They will destroy the Hindus who came together.
Don't forget Bhima Koregaon, it was only 500 at that time.
The dialogues of this movie are awesome...Ô∏è

Eros now I demand write bajirao instead of ranveer Ranveer didn't go to prove himself whether he is Peshwa or not Respect Bajirao 
Yarr Ranveer has lived this character.
Combat Archers never used to aim or hold as it creates tension in body plus chaos of war never gives enough time.Also stance is wrong and elbows are low means hands are trying to do hard labour which means arrow will hardly reach the target.Director needed to have better knowlegE

Bahubali is best

I don&#39;t understand the whole movie was filled with dialogues to eliminate the Mughal Empire but they didn&#39;t show anything like that. The end of the movie was great but I thought it would be kind of war between Marathas and Mughals. I mean if the climax of the movie isn&#39;t concerned about the Mughal then why you just brought it up for no reason.

Bad acting for ranveer singh
Bekar movie...  Third class

Sanjay Leela Bansali is an afloat film maker. Every shot of his is amazing.
No,Bajirao has to prove himself to become Peshwa not Ranveer.

Maratha Empire at its zenith. May be because they went beyond boundaries with global view in mind. A lesson for today&#39;s india. Businesses needs to go global and   just like what the China did.

This one scene speaks the volume about this movie. May be the best one in recent times.

He was such a great warrior fought for truth against people who used to kill people because they were hindu but those reality is never shows

He is so much like me :-D

snajay leela bansali, rajkumar irani, ss rajamouli . undoubtedly the finest directors of Indian cinemas.

How much overacting does Ranveer do?

<b>James Grant Duff in his &quot;History of Mahrattas&quot;:</b><i>It may be truly said that, Bajirao had both, head to plan and hand to execute.</i><b>Jadunath Sarkar says in his forward to ‚ÄúPeshwa Bajirao I and Maratha Expansion‚Äù</b><i>‚ÄúBajirao was a heaven born cavalry leader. In the long and distinguished galaxy of Peshwas, Bajirao Ballal was unequalled for the daring and originality of his genius and the volume and value of his achievements. He was truly a carlylean Hero as king- or rather as Man of action.‚Äô If Sir Robert Walpole created the unchallengeable position of the Prime Minister in the unwritten constitution of England, Bajirao created the same institution in the Maratha Raj at exactly the same time.</i><b>Sir R. Temple says in ‚ÄúOriental Experiences‚Äù:</b><i>‚ÄúBajirao was hardly to be surpassed as a rider and was ever forward in action, eager to expose himself under fire if the affair was arduous. He was inured to fatigue and prided himself on enduring the same hardships as his soldiers and sharing their scanty fare. He was moved by an ardour for success in national undertakings by a patriotic confidence in the Hindu cause as against its old enemies, the Muhammadans and its new rivals, the Europeans then rising above the political horizon. He lived to seethe Maratha spread over the Indian continent from the Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. He died as he lived in camp under canvas among his men and </i><b><i>he is remembered among the Marathas as the fighting Peshwa, as the incarnation of Hindu energy.</i></b><b>British General Bernerd Montgomery in his </b><b><i>Concise History of Warfare</i></b><b> :</b><i>They(Marathas) were at their best in the eighteenth century, and the Palkhed campaign of 1727-28 in which Baji Rao I outgeneralled Nizam-ul-Mulk, is a¬†</i><b><i>masterpiece of strategic mobility.</i></b><b>Shreemant Peshwa Bajirao Ballal Bhat</b>The Undefeated Maratha Warrior 

Ranveer is delivering the dialouge n im feeling like im going to be the   panth!

Jai Shiva Ji Maharaj 
Kon kon lockdown me enjoy kr rha my favourite all times this movie love u bro

Great Peshwa Bajirao
BC sari zindagi hindu gulam he raha ab bus movies may sara hindustan fatah krain gay chutia salay
Bajirao Peshwa was really a miracle.Very strong n aggressive personality.

Jai Shivaray Maratha
One of my favorite scene starring Ranbir singh

Ancient Hindu people had understanding of both scriptures and weapons. But now the situation is different. If we want to make India great, we will have to try that action again.
Lund

Is there the full movie with English subtitles?

The rights of both Hindus and Muslims on the soil of India. Muslim kings have committed many atrocities but today we cannot punish our countrymen for the murder of history. Our Sanskrit and Sahibiyata have further improved due to the influence of Persia, as have our use of Urdu words in our tongue.
If you want to watch the film - South - Rajamouli book story North - Bhansali real story..
I wish Aurangzeb's family would be like him and Maratha would never come to India.
Who is here after Tanhaji : The Unsung Warrior release.

I have saw so many actors who has played Marathi hero but only Ranveer Singh has adopted the Marathi accent.

Gohil

<a href="">1:54</a> peeche bhagwan ram ki tasveer hai

Har Har Mahadev

This proof that Ranveer is hungry and he love what he does  you can call him joker but you can&#39;t deny that he is one of the Greatest

Tanhaji and Bajirao Mastani are the best movies in this genre.

Watch his marathi ascent.

What has happened here has happened here and will happen in the future too, for every Kshatriya there is a Brahman Guru.
Goosebumps kise kise aaya
mindblowing scene

What a joke

Wow

I am a big hrithik fan.but gotta admit Ranveer Singh is very talented and most versatile actor in Bollywood

Teacher - Acha - Hi - Mile - Aap Ko!Chaha Kar Bhi - Suna Nahi - Unkein - Kamals!
Banana Nahi  (Hide Ko - Jaan Na Tha - Sui - Saheb)!
Make it!
Every time i watch this scene I get goosebumps

filmay bana k khush hojio real main to the is fantastic hojata hai

Who is here after Seeing Panipat.

Super scene &amp; dialogue


Chite ki chal baj ki najar or baji Rao ki talwar pe sakh nahi karteBest dialogue ever
And this is how 4 min of excellent dialogue without vfx beat the crap out of entire panipat movie

Har Har Mahadev
Hence LHS=RHS Proved

In this movie, Ranveer has set the acting criteria which will be used for 1000 years till no one will be able to move.
Chite's rice or eagle's sharp glance ???
I dont know why everyone sings prasies for Ranveer he was acting like a child nodding head and saying stupid dialogues like cheete ki chaal and stuff him turning 180. Peshwa Bajirao was a great warrior why should a great warrior be potrayed by such a childish actor

Ranveer song was the best actor

one of the most powerful scene

Why is all this missing from books??
This Man Peshwa Baji Rao, never got the true credit in history and its sad. Shivaji and Peshwa Bajirao, the two greatest Marathas ever born were the true architects of Maharashtra and Marathi culture. Shivaji made it strong and Baji Rao spreads in entire India. Shivaji Raje did get his credit in history but Baji Rao did not get it. It&#39;s high time we should make this man famous.

Like For 2020

Very nice mandloi miss you

Hahahaha.Tum bahubali nahi ban saktey,ranveer singh
Tattya topey saab par b movie ban ni chaiye

Jai ho brahmin bajirao ji
Maratha Empire
Par main is talking nonsense about the film because this is the dialogue actor to bariya but this is the anti hindu motive of bollywood meaning warrior veer ko in bollywood has made my crazy lover true mainly that is why I have watched more south movies because south The industry is more patriotic and racist than Bollywood but the dialogue of this film is very poor.
Bajirao not Ranveer Singh write title properly

Ranveer the ganja Loda

Jai Shivaji...
Not ranveer but bajirao had to prove to become peshwa 

Medieval India was such an epitome of power. Such grace and royalty, sadly it broke down...

who actor in panipat is not suitable guys hnna

then their is arjun kapoor.....

Balaji bajirao- the fighting peshwaÔ∏è
I highly doubt if the Chhatrapatis were living this lavishly

Fabulous entry
The legend who never lost a war in his life... Bajirao Peshwa

Her powerfull entry
Goosebumps bitch!!!!!

Reading the comments box seems to show how useless or dirty your thoughts are against Muslims.
Wah Wah Ranvir
Master piece of Bollywood movies

BEST SCENE FOREVER 
If there is any movie based on King Ashoka , you know who will do it better 

Har Har Hindutwa...

i am die hard fan of bajirao
Bajirao also attacked Jad but the tree did not fall!!!
The head nodding expressions of ranveer is priceless.

Yv

Everyone is awestruck by Ranveers acting but Mahesh Manjrekar did a good job in this scene as well.

Great actor

Had Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj been there, the Mughals would have fled from India. Our Lord was killed by deceit.
Bharat

Bajirao 1 one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen, he won nearly entire indiand stamped the authority of maratha and Hindu swaraj on Indian region, mughals and nizam  were threatened of bajirao, he didn&#39;t lose a single battle in his entire career.  We as Indians are blessed to have warriors like bajirao peshwa..

Jay Shivray 
BAJIRAO.. KI JAY
Lol too late Ahmad Shah Abdali came to India 17 times if you guys did have any true warriors he would have been stopped the very first time he came and not go and come back 17x.

Don&#39;t present wrong history. Mughals was ruled on marathas and all india.

Yhi acting panipat me hoti to.....just imagin

The deeper politics/conspiracy might have been this : Bajirao and &#39;his&#39; team already knew about the test. So while placing the feather, the broken part might also have been added. &quot;Pehle se thora chota hai&quot; is just a distraction to convince people, similar to any magician&#39;s trick. He still needed to show his prowess by hitting the clay which he did. While everyone gasps at something spectacular, a smart guy simply steals the show with his talent.

I'm sorry
Shreemant Bajirao Ballad
The great bajirao peshwe
Excellent introduction scene of Bajirao. Outstanding performance by Ranveer. He lived in the character.

I&#39;m really so grateful I can now support my family thanks to, look up in Google this excluding gaps <b>FunOnline Work .c om</b>

Entry jabardast..and music superb...

Brother...
Because of Ranbir Singh the movie became hit otherwise history knows the doglebazi of M. R. A. T. H.

All Indians are warriors . Let it be Marathas , Sikhs, rajputs and  many regional kings in every state has its own pride .Har har Mahadev 
Jai Bawani
Say with pride that we are Hindus.
Kdk

Direct roots pe attack kroge to ..branches gaand me guss jaengi..bhenchood chutiye .who agree

i saw this more than 500 times

Change the title to Bajirao has to prove...

Career best...
Arjun has to see ranveer performance

No1 can beat Sanjay leela bansali flims.. Looks very original
My only question  is why this scene is so epic?

All the wars are fought by rural peasant laborers tribals ...no king was great or tactful ...like now king is modi of india earlier was manmohan ,doesn't mean he is smart / tactful in whole india .very much like him Yes...but history is going to be made by Modi Manmohan Rahul
Epic

Are you father, what acting have you done Ranveer Singh ji......
not ranveer. its bajirao dope

Amr Joban besedin r cholbona &quot;&quot;&#39; Mon Amr chenlona Bujurgo Around... Manush r hobo kobea...
Only in film not a realty 
Now a days Indian forgot their pure language Hindi.

he proved unstoppable youngster should learn

Mughal princesses remained thirsty, of Marathas, of L***l!
Our bajirao is like this...we have seen the vampanthiyo disrobing the peshwaji.
Everything is perfect.... dialogue, expression, set , costume...

Bina soche samjhe panipat main arjun kapoor ko kaisee le liya nice for arjun but sad for us 

Sach me yaar ranveer was best than arjun

Ranveer had to prove?!

<a href="">3:52</a> Baji Rao must have been the first Marata to attack Delhi.

Look at the way he is walkingSuch boldness and strength even in his walking style

Don't doubt the speed of the cheetah, the vision of the eagle and the sword of the eagle can ever kill.
The dislikes must be from the descendants of Mughals and Bijapur Sultanate

Arjun kapoor, am I meme to you
<a href="">02:02</a> Padmaavat BGM
Also, the best acting in Mahabharat is done by those actors who have not done historical acting.
Milind soman should do more period roles

Don't doubt Chite's gait, Baaz's gaze and Kalki's talent... Always and always the mother is the power!
Best movie I ever watch 
I am watching after panipath and tanaji trailer, Ranbir had done great Job

Super Hero
Ranveer has to prove himself as Peshwa : WRONGBAJIRAO has to prove himself as Peshwa : RIGHTShrimanta Bajirao Peshwa wrote what are your hands falling off??
Who Ranveer Bajirao came there, Bajirao proved himself
Don&#39;t scroll just go and put ur phone in another room

Jai Bhavani Jai Shivaji
Ranveer is great actor because his dialogue is in beautiful marathi accent.

Ranveer owns the scene! A good screen presence, and a realistic accent.

Poori movie upload kro please

Peshwa are Pradhan and Chhatrapati are king of Maratha Empire .someone are saying Peshwa are king.peshwa is a post given by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj which is 2nd most important post after king.their are many Peshwa during the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Sambhaji maharaj.bajirao was Pradhan not king.

the epic line <a href="">1:32</a>

<a href="">4:26</a> that poster has more expression than arjun had in his whole Bollywood career

Pani pat bhole ho gaye ho.jb Ahmad Shah Abdali ny poiri marhatta power ko nabood tha.or marhatton ki sari sardar mary ho gaye thy.itni zillat amaiz shakist ho ho gaye ho.
The gait of the cheetah and the sight of the night's bat.
If Sanjay Leela Bhansali Sir was directing Panipat then it would have been Ranveer Singh in lead role

SLB has Masterfully directed this scene.  Phenomenal

Our ideals are only Shivaji Raje, Sambhaji Raje, Bajirao and Balasaheb. Long live Maratha Empire

Those dislikes are from &#39;Panthpratinidhi  &#39;s family ..

How can one bear Arjun Kapoor for 3 hours after having watched such a masterclass from Ranveer!

He like Aditya Thackeray and  Old cm

In maratha army there is no castism,no hindu-muslim no dalit,  all are one

May be the greatest job interview of all time...Kamal hai shrimant bajirao peshwa waahh...what a vision for Maratha empire!!!

Ranveer Singh Fan
ranvir singh is the fine example of hard work and talent he is like virat kohlidoesnt matter how much he abuse and do funny things when he comes on field he show his perfection in Gamesimilarly Ranvir singh may dress up funny , participate in AIB but when it comes to Actinghe is damn serious and give his best

Period films are made for sanjay leela bhansali, ranveer, Deepika, Priyanka and aishwarya.... Baaki sb please Mt try kro....

Ten time watch this seen...*Bajirao Masatani*

Superb action by the entire cast! Maza agaya!!

Nice

Hindu rashtra reloaded.

if we had won the battle of Panipat , Satara/Pune would have been the Capital of India.

Jai peswa muglo ki gand mari
Imagine ARJUN KAPOOR in this scene 

after getting hangover with panipat and refreshed my mind.. thank you ranveer all the best for kapil dev movie

who is script writter

ranveer&#39;s maharathi accent  very perfect....

I am damn sure This scene is way better than arjun kapoor whole performance in Panipat...

Bsdike Arjun Kapoor is said to be acting, maratha accent and great maratha character play, accent, body language Dekho perfect..Arjun Bhadwe
After Panipat trailer...?

It&#39;s not Ranveer who had to prove. It was the great Bajirao Ballal who proved himself. And it was the great Chhatrapati Shahu who picked this young gem from amongst very capable generals.

Panipat ke baad mood theek karne aya hu

The Peshwa i.e. Brahmin rule had inflicted so much oppression on the Dalits and backward classes that they wanted to get relief by joining hands with the British rule. üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥This Peshwa king had supported the Mughals against Shivaji.
Punjabi Ranveer did Marathi accent with so much perfection...

A warrior like Bajirao will not return Jai Shivarai
Detoxification after watching panipat trailer 
Panipat dekh k mood off ho gya tha, mood teek krne aaya hu.Now feeling great !
