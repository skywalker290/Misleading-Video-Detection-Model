Such a cultureless west-beaten bitcoin

It cant be coincidence.

NICK MUST BE A CAPRICORN

No cuz ellan is so funny
How much they love red in India, do they even understand that too many colors spoil everything?
She always speak hindu

They are normally 5 days

How sweet.

look at me
She&#39;s not only the lucky one Nick is lucky too

Queen Priyanka is so awesome️ she’s where she is today because of her hard work, it has NOTHING to do with Nick and she has everything she has right now because she earned it, LOVE HER

God bless you ️️️️
I love you so much priyanka ️️. You are looking beautiful ️ and gorgeous ️️.
The most beautiful couple ever

In India a wedding is just like a whole feast that lasts for days..They have different different mini function on separate days..

Priyanka stopped Ellen dead in her tracks
you bastard you are crazy
Destiny

They really are a great couple. So genuinely nice and friendly.

Ellen is really funny... So I'm curious to see that tarot cards have Nick Jonas' face on them hahahah
Today she had a hindu wedding with nick tomroww she will changed nick to hindu..one away from god 2 closer to many gods

The host was not do kind on Priyanka

Weddings in India and Pakistan takes longer

I didn&#39;t heard anything about nick Jonas before Priyanka Chopra married him.

There are many singers in America and Nick Jonas is not that famous here.  He wasnt a big &quot;hit&quot; here in America.  But i admire him for his good heart &amp; family oriented.  I hope he treats his wife and kid good because Priyanka is a wonderful female.

Ellen we may have the same birthdays 26 4

<a href="">1:37</a> she sounded like cardi

We Indian know Jonas brothers coz of Priyanka

I know Nick Jonas only because of Priyanka

Brianka is beautiful 
WHAT  A   YOUNG   HUSBAND!!!

LOVELIEST   BRIDE  ON  EARTH  EXCEPT  FOR  HER   LIPS

RITUALS !!!!!!!!

As proud indian... She didn&#39;t want talk in diff accent and she is as real as it while talking also

Someone please educate Ellen on how big of a star Priyanka is. The Jonas brothers have nothing on her.. all of their base combined! Ellen can surely learn humility from her if nothing else.

Looks like Ellen never tried interviewing Aiswarya Rai

<a href="">1:55</a> lol  Ellen is a such playerrr, my friend worked for a while in Priyanka&#39;s team and Ellen &amp; Portia were very much invited to the wedding...not just Ellen, other celebs like Dwayne, Harry, Meghan, etc were also invited AND they sent good wishes too stating that due to schedule/protocol issues they won&#39;t be able to attend...Ellen probably doesn&#39;t check with her team of the events she&#39;s called to Anyway I love them both  I wish Ellen could make it to the wedding (or acknowledge the invitation atleast)

Pryanka made me love India she’s really a beautiful person and is really big deal his really lucky to have her

PC most loved Indian actress who made the nation proud several times. She&#39;s a Global icon. I wish her and her loving family a big success ahead. Love to Malti Mari

Wear proper clothes Priyanka !!!!

Priyanka congrats
Watched.
Deepika Padukone was certainly more comfortable with Ellen than Priyanka.. With her it &#39;s like a tiff here.

farting accent 
Yes... Correct... Me from southern part of india.. Kerala... Hr in our marriage... Mostly 1000 above people in marriage day

Love you so much Priyanka 
That concert 

Her sense of humour is awesome...and confidence is out of the world.....I do not like celebrities much but she&#39;s the one who inspires a lot of women in real 

The same situation here in Uzbekistan 

She ( Ellen)  makes it sound like Priyanka married up.. LOOK AT THAT WOMAN …she is FLAWLESS… Ellen is just a bitter angry Lebanese

What a sexy color of priyanka

Dream come true by the tarot card



The tarot cards indicated SRK,not Nick.

Ellen, there is a world outside ur country...

sad Ellen wouldn&#39;t be invited in any Indian wedding

Priyanka b like &quot;&quot; "Father, you have opened your door"
She is so superficial and superfluous......

I love Priyanka
Priyanka also made Jonas brother famous in Bangladesh also️

Ellen was a bit rude

Nick is so lucky to have Priyanka as his wife️

She is my favorite



Green card Chopra 

Beautiful and talented Priyanka Chopra Jonas

I did not know about nick before Priyanka Chopra&#39;s marriage  but before marriage priyaka already famous in many nations

Grandma priyanka
Happy Diwali PC
True Indian weddings last really long

Literally in this short time, she and indian just proved she’s more smarter than the host Alien

Nice

My brother wedding simple in village more than 4500 people 
Well, so I have noticed this now that Ellen said she wasn’t invited to their wedding and then Priyanka says “she didn’t respond to their invitation” wow Ellen 

That's so beautiful! All the best and blessings from the CreatorLots of love and happiness 
Grand star wedding ️Littel life saving .Ellie mother - in - low : very well Responding power .

Their love is so fake specially Nick’s.Priyanka May love him but he doesn’t.priyanka could have been happier

I love priyanka she’s my culture and I love it

Not a great host... Constantly putting Ms Chopra down...pl Watch priyanka&#39;s work and achievements... She has made India v proud.. And am not even a fan... Some of her notable work: Barfi, Mary Com, Bajirao Mastani, Fashion, Kaminey, Don, Aitraz, Dil Dhadakne Do

She is outstanding dedicated loyal actress in Bollywood.

Ellen is cunning for Indians

<a href="">3:34</a>

Priyanka nailed it man 
Nick- our national jiju
Cant even drink one shot properly and asking for tequilla everytime she is there

She is so fake!

My favorite heroine is one and only lovely priyanka chopra 

In India if you see a wedding happening somewhere  ..you can literally enter the wedding and eat the delicious food and no one would complain...like literally anyone can come.

Really I lv priynka

Priyanka lies so much just saw a part of it here

Hey Ram, what kind of news do you show me, Vande Matram?
what did ellen by saying priyanka was lucky?It was the other way around. Dude made the first move

Ellen always speak rubbish, She is lucky or nick is the luckiest guy who got priyanka chopra . He is not even 10% what she have made herself without any help globally. No one globally has achieved so much, as she is.

Big fan of Priyanka chopra 

People don&#39;t like you when you tell truth priyanka isn&#39;t beautiful.

So one of the first times that she ever proposed to him was when he was 16 and she was 27???.....lol but anyways they are a really great couple now.!!!!

Sister-in-law, you are looking very dirty.
Christian ceremony?? It was civil marriage not a church one I&#39;m confused

Maybe using every boby knowledge me lmean not interested you country&#39;s

Priyanka is so beautiful , Nick is so lucky to have her ! I love you priyanka ️️️

All of your shows are perfect and you know how to hold your shows in funny way

<a href="">4:00</a> that&#39;s embarrassing

Priyanka chopra is one of fvt heroine ️

Priyankaaaa....babyyy.. Lieeeedddd   ... Ohh i dint knew himmmmmmmm..... Jonas brothersss
Male shoulders

Just to compare... I had 500 guests for my 10th birthday and we are middleclass peeps 

she&#39;s got enough money n fame before she even knew Nick forget  marry him..Ellen if ever comes to India should definitely be interviewed by our journalist Barkha Dutt!

I like your show. But your angry at me.
Is it a transgender marriage...

Hello good morning fantastic Love marriage wale Hain appa Kong

Nick is lucky to have priyanka chopra.. She is intelligent, miss world, beautiful.. Full package 

I did not know Jonas unti PC got married!!

World know they all

I can&#39;t believe she had only 200 people at her wedding for being Indian and super famous. That&#39;s the equivalent of having 20 people at an American wedding- not even kidding..

Beautiful Priyanka Chopra Jonas ️️
My favourite Priyanka Chopra Jonas ️️
And indian orta kpr q nh phanti
Every one knows who is the lucky one..Ellen&#39;s behavior was Too unfunny but loved how priyanka backfired &amp; handle her with a sweet smile whole time on her face...

We Indians  don&#39;t know who is nick Jonas before  priyanka chopra  gave him identification in India too by marrying him

I wish there were subtitles in Russian! I love Ellen! ️️️
Nick is lucky

Priyanka Chopra deserve to be her place amazing proud of you dear ️

He is sooo average not goodlooking by any standard

1000 ppl is alot .Priyanka let&#39;s not overdo it.. 

It&#39;s like a planned one how it is. Surely not  unfortunately !!!

Love you Priyanka ️
On a very serious note I guess Nick is more lucky to have The Priyanka Chopra as his wife 

She wanted to prove to her that she had married him through magic
So pretty

That&#39;s true @ my rules

Congratulations mam

There was nothing intimate about that wedding. It was a big showy affair

Where&#39;s tarro reader  I need her 

So millenium awaaz right!!!
<a href="">1:54</a> We were so offended that you didn’t even respond to our invite

Law of attraction 

Great edit Ellen to cool

Haha, you gotta love the moment at <a href="">1:59</a>.

Glue the coat
She always denied that she didn&#39;t know Joan&#39;s Brother infact She had crush on him when he was only 16th   &amp; She went there in his concert 2008 n proposed him through banner when he even don&#39;t know who She is . But she must b appreciated that she climbed 2 that lader by working hard in making her&#39;s dream comes TRUE ️. She is such an amazing n inspiration woman ️

Ellen came for nick and she was having it…she like don’t come for my husband…

Now i know, kardashian trynna look like indian

Please where do they read cards for people&#39;s future spouse? Cause errrmmmm

Racist Ellen is Lucky Priyanka came on her show

Nick is getting famous in India day by day because of her 

Intimate wedding of 200 
She&#39;s really wearing a  on her solitaire* toe too.

Uff how accuarate that card reader prediction was totally shocking

Priyanka Chopra made Jonas brothers famous in India and Nick Jonas made priyanka famous world wide....

200 is like nothing in India. Even halwais are attendees in India.

Thank you for this interview Ellen .Enjoyed the time spent with Pryianka. She is always fun to listen to; never a bored moment. So warm, beautiful and sweet. .

Q - national JIJU of India?Ans - Nick Jonas

It&#39;s true not only mainland India but here in Nagaland too which are Christian state of NE India we invite like 3000/2000 peoples and made preparation according to it..... And it&#39;s not like all the invite will show up but even thought they dnt show up they send their gifts and things

Ellen: you did a show five years ago in india, right?Priyanka: <b>hella confused</b> uhm yeaEllen: what was the show?Priyanka: which show did i do in india?Ellen: this one oh my GodAre you serious ellen?! She has done so many shows in india, more than what you can think of and you are asking her that she did a show 5 years ago? At least mention which show than to react like oh my God that too annoyingly

Priyanka didn&#39;t fire back good enough. Maybe because Ellen was trying to put her down by lifting nick who, is her husband so she let it pass. It was Nick this time not India or Bollywood.

Not priyanka having more followers than all the Jonas brothers combined

Who&#39;s watching this from which country ????

ellen always tries the ‘you didn’t invite me’ play whenever she can and it always backfires lol

Nick made India popular
India️️
She is my love/crush , Priyanka mam ️ love from india and your heart

Loving natural

How rigid of Ellen :( ....so not open to other cultures.

A lot of westerners seem to think Priyanka was mostly made famous by nick jonas or something (Ellen clearly being no different) but to a significant portion of the East (I’m talking AT LEAST the WHOLE of south Asian and much of Southeast Asia) she was a household name from her Bollywood megastardom. She was like ultra A list celeb like there are only a handful of female actresses at the very top in Bollywood which is the largest film industry (yes it’s even larger than Hollywood) and she was one of them. Technically she’s “more famous” than the most famous Hollywood actresses like Angelina Jolie but they ain’t ready for that conversation.

Fake accent

BesharaM

PC and Jonas Brothers were both famous in their own world, PC in Hindi Language World and Jonas in English Language World. Some people doing arguments that one made another famous. Actually they both made each other famous in their World when they got married.

(The media and the formation of childhood awareness)If, for example, you brought an empty cup for the experimentAnd another full of waterIt would be very impossible to add a single drop to a full cup without the water overflowing from the full cupWhile it will be easy to fill the empty cup with waterSo the examples are clearWhat I want to say in this expression is that adults whose minds have crystallized on a certain approach, it is not easy to change that approach.But it is easy to change the minds of children because they are not completed due to the immaturity of the stages of awareness and educationThe media always throws all its weight on children through television broadcasts, animations and some games with the aim of distorting the dictionaries of truth, goodness and respect.But there is someone who catches up with the cup filled with stagnant water and empties it immediatelyBecause the book is thereAs long as the educated word exists, the project of ignorance will not be completed except in the most prosperous and comfortable classBecause money worksPoverty opens the doors of contemplation, awareness and thinking.ALI SUROOR

Smartest girl ever.
She had loved him for a long time

Oh she  is a beautiful lady

Ellen got pricked
SHE&#39;S SO PRETTYYYYY

No he’s not a good looking guy Ellen. He’s a 6! She’s a 9-10. She married down way way down.

Nick married Miss World 2000 dude, he is lucky

They was a caught 

When people say Incredible INDIAMy mind: Priyanka Chopra, her wedding and the Viel....

They both are lucky to get each other....Offcourse we are lucky to got a chance to see them (Good &amp; romantic couple )

Am i the one who feel a bit embarrassing on her accents i mean she can just keep it real.....

Do not mind I am confusing elen man or Women 

If ellen was inI ndia , her rating will be lower than tiktok

.

Her laugh is so fake

The comments doth protests too much

Indian weddings that last 3 days is by no means intimate

What did I say to all the recruits?
Priyanka is a good actor in my India. I am proud of you. Good health. And good health yours family. I am prayer God big big superstar

Well she got more attention from their media after marrying their celebrity ,same is true for him.She made the most of it as it was a much bigger industry and dream for her .No other Miss Worlds let alone PC  irrespective of whichever country they are from would have end up this way otherwise.I am not sure if she owns that culture or carry it anymore.Some of the comments surprise me.Aishwarya is on the other hand different and remained grounded to roots.

200 is quite intimate for a South Asian wedding. Moreover both of them are celebrities. Even normal people invite 300-400. How hard is it to acknowledge other cultures. The joke&#39;s on u Ellen. 

Ellen is sooooo rude.  What does she mean Priyanka is so lucky to have grabbed him ( Nick Jonas)???? Right from the beginning of the interview, it is sooo obvious that Ellen is colour biased.  Horrible woman.

200 people in india is like the number of people in india who knows the Jonas brothers.

And now they are blessed with a baby ️

She is so so beautiful

<a href="">4:10</a> was she really priyanka

I just wanted to hit Ellen  when she said Priyanka is lucky enough to grab him. Without Priyanka, he would have never been popular outside US. She&#39;s rich, talented and famous than him

Who is this lady???

Ellen is always rude to outsiders

Priyanka nailed it ️

Fake accent 

I don&#39;t see the fascination tbh

Ellen is a liar, and Priyanka ( being the intelligent woman she is) called her out, on the whole wedding invite

Who cares whom she married.

desi chicken exotic move
Ellen should be thanking India for all of these views.

Priyanka: wowza.    Ellen: yea he’s a good looking guy          Priyanka : yea

This is a complete deal marriage where Jonas Bros will get some recognition and priyanka will get citizenship. What u think guys??

She’s one lucky B… Nick is and has such a beautiful personality. ️

Deduct money for overacting
Nick is so lucky to have her ️

Man she is beautiful

Afdal A the moonlight Star Lion only one W

Overrated

Ellen ur a bit rough with her and I don&#39;t like it

Well just to be priyanka mem should to be luck to be love so happy so to be have

Fake accent

She always starts with American accent but she fails to continue

Jonas has famous... reason of Priyanka.... Priyanka has miss world... Bollywood hit actress,singer, divas

Anybody from India watching ...Attendance please !!

Ellen is so toxic
the host dressing sense all time wonderful

Okay people quit it. They both are lucky to have each other. PERIOD.

That’s super amazing  wow

Ellen doesn&#39;t realise that if every Indian chipped in $1 to her, she will become a Billionaire.

I like priyankaa...️️️️...cute couple...
Look at priyanka and thenLook at kangana Priyanka is successful actor without controversy,she a good person,intelligentShe is an an Indian iconKangana is drama queen

I wish I was rich

Nice

Priyanka
priyanka z overacting...
I wander how can people take seriously such personalities.

I agree Priyanka is intelligent, a great bollywood actress, came from elite background, was miss world.Omg! People need to open their brains  and be know about different cultures, countries. Priyanka  is beautiful, unique. Just an exceptional, woman. Any man will  be proud of her.Nick! is a lucky man.yanka

Nick Jonas is fortunate to have her actually 

She isn&#39;t lucky to grab him ELLEN . They loved each other and Nick proposed her . C&#39;mon

Any one is here after divorce 

Her voice is so so nice.

Well... Ellen is behaving like every Indian mother does (how paradoxical) after her &quot;competent&quot; son gets married to a woman who (according to the mother) isn&#39;t so &quot;competent&quot; to marry him.

Salman can never go on The Ellen Show

She is beautiful!!!

In whole bollywood no one can speak like her in English

U don&#39;t know priyanka chopra..helen.... Just come to India..

I am just a wife 

The way she defended her husband thoo .. NOOIICCEEEE!!!

We ppl of India dnt know who r jonas brother. Ohk so don&#39;t make look like he is more famous u idiot women.....

I hate all Hindus!
I like  her laugh

God Blessed them 
That come back from Priyanka though LOL. Well played Priyanka

They should change the title of every interview Ellen does to, &quot;Ellen thinks she&#39;s better and more famous than everybody else&quot;

1 billion Indians and  millions of Asians heard about Nick Jonas after he married The Priyanka Chopra!!

Acknowledgment, Priyanka is Miss World 2000. She’s incredible!

Nick Jonas got the most precious girlHe&#39;s so lucky

Lol vidshopped, Priyanka just don&#39;t remember any,cuz she telling the truth,and just try to cover ellen?

Beautiful sweet heart 
Did I Just Hear Family (You Know If You Know) 

I am Indian 🇮🇳. I really knows Nick after he became a groom of priyanka chopra. My favorite. Actress.

<a href="">4:04</a> &amp; <a href="">4:48</a> I realized this pretty late (today) that these is not real but edited. 

I really got to know jonas brothers bcoz of priyanka 

When you finally get a text from your crush : <a href="">3:21</a>

The right way to introduce someone to the society is &quot;Interview&quot;.Someone&#39;s life journey can inspire and encourage others....

Well I didn’t know about Jonas Brothers. But i knew about Priyanka as Miss of the World and a Bollywood star.

We know Jonas brothers just because of Priyanka Chopra...... Meri pyari dur ki behan.... 

She is such a hardworking Women she inspires many people 

Maybe Priyanka can teach her friend Meg about family values

Prianka Chopra  made Jonas  brothers  famous In India 
I don’t like the way ellen was talking.. 

Did Ellen say &quot;grab&quot; .... Such a Ellen DeGenerate
One year later ... Cmon Ellen ... such a hypocrite..

She is not looking good

I just want to know that who is this person who is going to every interview of Priyanka and writing that she made Jonas brothers famous in India.This personś everywhere!!!!

Is she is a singer i haven&#39;t heard  her name before but sge is beautiful

Actually it’s not only in India, but in Israel, Armenia, Russia, in really lot’s of countries. It‘s not only american type of wedding in the world)

You should drop the accent. It wasn&#39;t there in you tarot clip

Nick is lucky to having pri as his wife

Does indian understand English???
Just saw Priyanka in The Kapil Sharma show. There she was explaining American culture..and here the Indian culture. It is hilarious to watch 

Ellen saying priyanka is lucky to get him Dude nick just got MISS WORLD for a wife ..... Seriously who&#39; s more  lucky?? Plus she is really smart,brainy , beautiful , works with UN , got an entire bollywood fanbase, sings etc what not !! Atleast you got half good genes for a good kid

PC proud of u

And most specially she&#39;s richer than him

<a href="">3:09</a> her expressions 

Yup ..... 1000 people wedding is not big enough for an Indian wedding!

Shes good in English (I mean the way she speaks) omg 

Priyanka is perfect in everything

that part of the concert just killed me lol

She is right indian wedding atleast 1000 people would be there...200 is very less actually...

she was so so rude

Great

I don&#39;t know what Ellen trying to do with non westerns she Did the same with BTS this is very normal in the nature of western people but whenever they come to India we welcome them and we will no matter how they behave with us bcoz India believe guest is god this is the culture of india which this idiots will never understand.....

Desi girl Priyanka chopra

priyankachopra
They r famous in India now c&#39;mon give me a like
Most indian artis actors is famous in Indonesia also, we used to watching bollywood movies, and i know little bit of pc and nick because nick is jonas brothers, congratulations for you and your hard work in carrier, your dreams come true

Any indian bts army are here? 

Who was that Tarot reader?

National jiju
Don&#39;t feel offended, her show is based on insulting and trolling guest, so it&#39;s kinda normal for her

I’m just now learning that Joe is married lol what…..and Boycott Ellen show

They only see eachother a couple of days a month. That is not a marriage. It&#39;s not even dating. 

Shes beautiful indian girl and nice how she deliver to speak indian

I m an Indian and I grew up watching Jonas bros.

We need to know that common friend, I heard of him/her in each and every interview of them

So proud of priyanka she made her name  even before marrying nick .

Not only priyanka Got a foreigner  husband There are soo many Indians have been married to foreigners as well some ..

Us guy indian girl married

Ellen&#39;s passive aggressive face comes off easily whenever she interviews n Asian.

When you don&#39;t like them,don&#39;t call them for interviews.Problem solved!BTW I don&#39;t know who&#39;s her husband still but he&#39;s lucky bcz she&#39;s a 

Fake accent

From what nick said they met two different ways one said dms and the other said through a friend

Fun fact : All Indians know Nick because of Priyanka Chopra.. Because he is the jiju of our country..

Nick is now a household name in India. Cudos to PC

Ellen is looking younger than before..

Am I the only one who think this is insult .before saying priyanka is lucky think of her status before marrying nick she is not just anyone she is miss world don&#39;t forget that

Everyone saying she should b lucky to have him but I think he should b lucky to have miss world as his wife

Ellen was trying her best to belittle Priyanka, just like she always does. But PC&#39;s replies rendered her speechless!   

You bust me on Ellen show!?

Cool Video

She is amazing

Dress

Really after seeing this video and reading some of the comments about how lucky priyanka is to marry Nick or how she is a gold digger, I feel that many American people need to look outside of their country. Like the world doesn&#39;t only have the Hollywood. I also think that all these gold digger type comments are extremely sexist as honestly priyanka is much much more richer and successful than Nick. So if we go by that philosophy Nick should be the one going after money (chill I know he is not ). But it made me extremely angry and also fed into the stereotype that Americans are ignorant of anything outside their country (I dunno if they are or not though).

Love jihad
Way you dont tich Meghan. To respect her  family ....be her model if you   threw  friend

She&#39;s incredible!! I love her so much 

Shes witty and sophisticated at the same time.. ️

You know being an Indian When we had &#39;grah pravesh&#39; (home entry puja to a new house) we had almost 1000 people their and I don&#39;t know 70% of them

Pakistani weddings are much better than India 

Her accent is so fake 

LOl 

be to you
Nick is lucky to have girl like priyanka, she has 3times more followers than nick ...how come ellen says she&#39;s lucky...

I think this is show of extra ordinary child ...es gawar ko waha jane ki kya jarurat tha....

PC is ️️
Ellen doesn&#39;t like Priyanka Chopra
Well I didn&#39;t know either of them but once in a marriage your both equals, so they are blessed to have each other

Ellen  Nick is lucky to have a Miss world for his wife

Every time I watch this video I feel like two unlikely people who doesn&#39;t like each others are having a conversation and try to have fun

Priyanka is the pride of India And she&#39;s that strong independent self made artist in Bollywood. Nobody  can shut her up or offend her. Loved PC 

Indian ppl r really serious about love

When I want love I go to the .BANK....WHEN I WANT FAMILY DRAMA I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN.  WHEN I NEED TO BE ROB I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN.. WHEN I LOOKING FOR A MANGER AND BOSS I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN... WHEN I NEED TO SEE A SLY FOX I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN ...

In my office few staff always check PC in office PC

priyanka chopra is v girlish beautiful and cute

She is very smart.. India Proud of you PC.. most humble kind talented actress in bollywood...

Doesn&#39;t matter how many people we inviteIndian wedding r best

Ellen show needed to end

&quot;You are lucky enough to grab him&quot;!! Seriously..?just check their Instagram followers ️️Who is watching this in July 2021

PCJ is the best...love you 

This is true indian wedding is like a week of celebration

Ellen supposed to tell audience that whatever pc is here because of Nick hey you she is more popular than Nick you could only check her Instagram and Twitter followers they are much greater than Nick followers 

Indian pride ️
Royal wedding

As we can see here as well Americans knows nothing, literally nothing

Our jiju is just famous for our Di..... proud of you di.....

She is very fake like her friend Meghan

just to get insulted she was invited to the show.

I am Indian
I still don’t know much about Nick except Priyanka’s husband. LolMore than a billion people now know about Nick and Jonas Brothers just because of Priyanka. Never heard of this band before

C&#39;mon:)) you got lucky to grab him !  He(Nick) got super super lucky to have a women like her , I mean just look at her she has got real goddess beauty !!

Ellen just doesn’t get how 200 people are extremely intimate for an Indian wedding! 

She already had the fame , looks and smarts before she met Nick.

I think priyenka is already more famous in the world more than nick..coz she is also miss world ND super talented , full of acting skills , also singer as wellI&#39;m not indian but in indian film industry , priyenka is the number 1 actress who have multiple talent...

Fake

priyanka giving her absolutely nothing by agreeing to almost everything she shows....well that&#39;s amazing..... It’s not easy to intimate girls from indian subcontinent

Sorry, but I also didnt know about this priyanka until she dated Nick. There are so many pretty indian girls and colleagues I&#39;ve known from my workplace and she just happened to be a Miss World.. that&#39;s all ‍️ No shades only facts.

95% of Indians know Jonas Brothers only bcs of Priyanka Chopra!

Zero at studies Mrs jones
Meh ...im not a big fan of Priyanka. Her mannerisms and accent are fake and so put-on. She&#39;s constantly trying so hard to appeal to the &quot;Western&quot; audience. But I do like that she called Ellen out on her B.S. if there&#39;s one person who&#39;s even faker its Ellen , so I love it when people clap back at her.

What was she trying to do ? Anhhh acting like Jennifer Lawrence, the fake accent...I can&#39;t listen to it.

Probably because we intend to marry only once in a lifetime mostly, and we do have large families

04 : 14 in 2008 pc was living her life more better then nick 

That lady seems strong and she is glowing. I like it.

She sounds like gal gadot

She is brilliant she achieved great way,, she&#39;s first Indian who married with international success man..She played oozed to be deshi girl and she make  respect and Priyanka followed the words of the &quot;Constitution&quot; of India very well, maintained the relationship of &#39;brother-sister&#39; ( we all Indians are brothers and sisters ) and she did not marry in India. Proud of you... ️

Can we take a moment and appreciate Ellen&#39;s Team for taking snippets from shows and making them hilarious.

Who will be watching in 2021? Yes video 
she coud cover her chest

Anybody recognize the Sansa stark of game of thrones..

rendevous with simi had soo many various ppl

Priyanka is so beautiful, intelligent, stunning, talented and kind hearted. Nick is so lucky to have her

She is so fake...

Prinyanka Dii is amazing... Whenever I see Ellen... Im Jst thinking about Bts... Bts interview she had... Any army here? 

Danggggg she is so beautiful 

Well the chat section still alive ..??

That&#39;s the problem of all Americans that they considered themselves superior

How many Indians are  watching the Ellen shows

HAHAAHAHA OMG I can&#39;t with those videos HAHAHHAHA

 Namaskar
No one specifically knew nick until they married

Tf, it&#39;s he who got lucky, Priyanka is more famous than any of the people mentioned there

I never knew Nick jonas before he got married to Priyanka, till today I don&#39;t know any of his songs nor do I find him attractive in any way just that he seems to be an ideal husband for her ️

You know so ke cool you can still steel

Priyanka forgetting she represents India in the world her dressing is too exposing

That was the moments when peryanka f**ked up ...

Ellen is a bitter person

indian fax

She is absolutely stunning 

As she ever talked about her experience in z-girls

She is negative and toxic

Priyanka. hazband wife with beautiful life.

Ellen don&#39;t know that there is the biggest world outside of USHow can she doesn&#39;t know about the miss world, iconic bollywood actress, UNICEF Goodwill ambassador priyanka .1.3billion indian people today  know Nick Jonas because of her . Nick Jonas get the opportunity here not priyanka

I can’t believe this lady is 38

I&#39;m from Kerala.. Kerala language: Malayalam (മലയാളം)
Are there any Malayalis here?
Any Malayalies in here..

I drank it without any hesitation.

well

Priyanka kundu is not country only global icon plz mind ur language

National jija (brother-in-law) of India- Nick Jonas

Priyanka u r a most talented women 

Subjectsaholic
Indians don't see where they are, because they are rich.
Ellen is karan johar of hollywood

Priyanka is acting typical Indian.. we invited you but you didn&#39;t respond though, may be we are not at your label.. blah blah... I mean who says that in some tv program.? ha ha ha.. funny

Tbh, I didn&#39;t knew who Nick Jonas ws, came to.knw him after he married to.Priyanka ‍️
Indians are not so rich so that they can invite 1000 of people by the way I am from Pakistan

No.1 chapabaz in the world

Gorgeous pc always
I dont like how ellen kept suggesting the point that SHE is lucky to have him

Priyanaka made nick famous in India 
Love from Sri Lanka️

Priyanka said Ellen didn&#39;t respond, just like Dakota said Ellen didn&#39;t even respond to her invite either. Ellen is a mean woman

<a href="">1:18</a> she  should have also said how can I not invite my watchman&#39;s family

I think, She married Nick Just for being American. LOL 

And they will divorce in a few years... Read my words..

Sometimes she says racist things

She got lucky!!!

I started knowing the jonas Brothers when nick jonas is married to pryanka chopra.

The electric corn surgically warn because judo bioinformatically shrug including a daffy staircase. different, poised cardboard

She is from Jamsedpur, Jharkhand

The fact that Ellen was acting like Priyanka was lying about inviting her. Ellen is so ridiculous. She pulled the same thing with Dakota Johnson. It seems to me Ellen thrives on making her guests uncomfortable.

Her name should be Ellen Degenerate. This is what happens when you don&#39;t realise the power of many. Her total fan following put together will be 1/10th of PCs at best

Priyanka is miss world , and Ellen show her like she is the  lucky one ...c&#39;mon,  you can&#39;t treat her like that..she has achieved so much , and priyanka is top star in india like jonas in USA, so can&#39;t compare there popularity, we know jonas  through priyanka and she is standing there through her hardwork . If she is not that popular, you definitely not invite her in your show,so Ellen you should be respectful to priyanka, she is just not an actor she has achieved so much ..

Love you priyanka
Concert of Nick Jonas where priyanka propose him and facial expression of Nick was so funny.... Like what is happening.... I&#39;m forgetting my lines it&#39;s distracting meeee

It&#39;s funny how Ellen was trying to frame Priyanka but forgot who she is messing with

is ellen a boy or a girl
Ellen always try to act oversmart and  put her guest  in awarkward situation

No knew who was NICK JONAS in India until Priyanka announced their wedding 

 wow nyc
The ellen show se nam the gandu show rakhdo iska

I have seen a movie&#39; Jumanzi &#39; 2018 And nick Jonas played a short role in that movie .First time I saw him And literally I don&#39;t know Jonas before priyanka &#39;s wedding From India ria

I&#39;m very happy for both of them...from now because of Ellen...love you

Ellen always comes across as that bitter aunt who is passing comments on millennialsAlso, I don&#39;t think ellen knows Priyanka&#39;s net worth is much larger than nick&#39;s. Not that it matters (to us anyway), but she seems to think otherwise

&quot;I do need tequila every time I&#39;m here.&quot;

SHE IS SO DARN RIGHT ABT THE NO OF PEOPLE...

It would be nice if you made us an Indian.
Priyanka is too much woman for Nick. I&#39;m waiting on the babies to really believe she did this out of love

Hi Ellen, Wanna see Aishwarya Rai &amp; Katrina Kaif on your show 

<a href="">5:24</a> Priyanka saying she didn&#39;t know much about Jonas Brothers is Meghan Markle saying she didn&#39;t know much about the Royal Family.Come on ladies...

ellen is the best video editor in the galaxy

Ohk who is that card girl I want to meet her 

fake woman
Our INDIAN BOSSS lady

I just dream see you, ellen  last night. Does it joking.The first time in my life that dream see ellen.

How much fake accent should I remove?
Overacting of accent and body language

I think Ellen said &quot;You&#39;re lucky to get him&quot; because she previously said Nick is good person &amp; Priyanka should be lucky to get a good person like Nick.

She is indeed a good actress.

How Many Indians Isn&#39;t Me only ~

those who know jonas bcoz of priyank can like this cmnt !

I didn&#39;t knew jonas brothers until priyanka happen. Nick is so lucky to have her.

I’m not kidding though, Indian weddings last DAYS

1000 - 2000 to choti baat hai indian wedding me to usse bhi jyada log ate hai

Love from bihar

priyanka, God has given you everything, you are the luckiest woman on the earth.

i love prianka

priyanka made johnes brothers famous in India

Fake indian

There are two types of weddings in India1st is more than 500 people (a mass wedding)2nd is only 2 people(groom and bride!){only we Indians know the 2nd type of wedding!}

who thought Pcee would turn out to be a cougar ..

Priyanka made jonas brother famous  in India.. Love you PC..

Marriages in India Last longer than Marriages is USA

Ellen didn’t respond. (?)?
Lol nick jonas wife is actually 10 years older then him

Priyanka is so confident.. love it

i&#39; m algerian and i had 400 people on my wedding and it was super intemate ...ususally there more than 1000

Is she Christian?

In india you don&#39;t marry the daughter,  you marry the whole family. 

Priyanka :I am Just a wife it was hilarious 

Wow!!
Proud Ellen, uneducated interviewer

Angrezz oo ko ghodi chadte huye indians ka dil nehi vara... As carryminati says
her accent smh

Well priyanka made Jonas Brothers famous in india 

Priyanka is so classy and strong. Ellen tried to make fun of her and bully her but Priyanka put her in her place.

Before their marriage, hardly anyone in India knew about Jonas Brothers

dont know wot Ellen thinks herself ! everytime she tries to show Indian ppl low standards with saying we are very lucky ...same thing she said to deepika...nvr underestimates d power of anyone  especially INDIANS ok nahi zaroori smjha hoga tujhe(faltu logo)  bulana agli ne !  lalloo laal khi ki en yeah one last thing ..luv from India 

kapil sharma: am i comedy you
PC️
Actually nick&#39;s lucky to grab Priyanka Chopra, cuz let&#39;s face reality... she can just carry 10 other stars in her pockets.

I love her

Height of exaggeration!

Fake woman pryinka shopra

Uno reverse card <a href="">2:00</a>
And this proves ellen is mean

Priyanka saying that it&#39;s difficult to zero down to a guest list is so relatable to most indians now

Oh Ma gawd, I&#39;m Pakistani so Indians share the same wedding type idk bassicly on every wedding we at least have 3000 people and she only had 200?  What the-

Priyanka seemed much more comfortable here....

nice wedding

Ellen is so racist towards asians like Priangka, bts, superM

He dm’ed me on ‘Twitter’

When you are strong independent woman but you have been side-chik of shahruk Khan to get roles in bollywoodb and flats in mumbai.... went on to use or give favors Jay Sean  to get into music album .. entertained Gerrard butler as stayed in his house few times so that media gets to know who you are.. and then you know lot of opportunist like you and idiots will treat you as a role model.

Ellen is a evil to nice people.

ellen is making her uncomfortable

She’s so beautiful 
Nick is our &#39;Jamaai Raja&#39; he is son in law of India

The media is the only place where the dead bodies are dug up….
Unnecessary things become famous in USA.  99.9 percent don’t do three day marriage in India and that’s definitely not certainly not the reason  longevity of marriages.

You are lucky to grab him... Well... She is way richer than Nick.

Ellen don&#39;t try to diss or underestimate an Indian womanYou don&#39;t know what might happen next It is true guys

That&#39;s our desi girl
Something is wrong

Jewellar.
Jewellary.
Plot twist - in Indian marriages gifts they get are less but what they find missing like (plates,glasses and even gifts) is on another level

Big fan of Ellen ! But in this video i felt something not right. Like in the end she uttered oh my god!  That was so rude. Obviously she does so many shows !  She might not remember and it&#39;s ok right!

Jonas brother in law
I&#39;m not Indian but I love all the concept and ceremonies in Hindu marriages. ️️️

What are this fellas talking about? Do you mean to say you dont know Jonas Brothers because you are more into bollywood? I think that is the right word. JONAS BROTHERS are so famous like as in. Duh.

Never heard of Priyanka until Nick Jonas married her..and I live in India...

Fake accent spotted

I am from India but I just know he is his husband , I don&#39;t know what he does

I don&#39;t even know who this is

what do you mean by she&quot;s got lucky enough to have nick?? that was so sick.

I personally feel like priyanka was the only one to think it was all about what she wanted of starting their relationship because she clearly has no idea of how what she has done of putting thoughts in nick&#39;s head of getting married in the first place it wasn&#39;t necessary for her to be doing that even tell everyone that she might be putting thoughts in his own head of having kids they clearly have some explaining to do of what they want

Wow priyanka in elen show

Yeah idk what&#39;s up with the comments....?

Lop

Jonas brothers became famous in Indian subcontinent just because of PC 

I just Really Admire Prianka&#39;s Confidence , She Fits IN with Everyone and Every Situation. Just like I Do MASHA ALLAH.

<a href="">4:01</a> don&#39;t mind me, Im just addicted with this part

We people invite everyone with our heart and it was oblivious of Priyanka to complain about her ignoring the invite like cmon she is just being her indian soul

There are so many people in Hollywood who exude a sunny facade and are the opposite behind closed doors. You can see with absolute certainty in any interview (or just Instagram pic she shares even) with Priyanka that she is made of nothing but goodness. It beams out of her effortlessly like a light

I o0i

I o0i

I o0i

I o0i

Desi girl. Videsi brother
Priyanka fits well in our American society as she is no different from our Afro americans. Seeing her the first time I thought she was from Zambia.

Chops looks so ravishing!!! Go girl!

Who thought it was real video 

Touching hair every minutes is just an Indian thing ,.. it doesn&#39;t matters wherever you&#39;re.. Priyanka showed it to the world 

PC proud of INDIA🇮🇳 

People are watching like this :- on bed - not in full-screen - reading comments...

I m just the wife

‘We were so offended that you didn’t respond to our invite though!’Me: Wow...you go girl

When Ellen said bout not having an invitation,Priyanka said she did invite them but she  didn&#39;t respond The same thing happened wid Dakota Johnson n when she pointed it out Ellen kinda insulted her.Ellen always does this 

Allen you are so jealous of her

So proud of you Priyanka 

Both the footages are fake priyanka&#39;s face is editing in first and nick&#39;s face is editing in the card

But that footage was fake. It has edited priyanka face

Nick is lucky to marry PC, the miss of world N even nick is lucky get introduce to Indian traditional wedding 

When Ellen told priyanka “I know nick a little bit, and I know YOU A TINY BIT” I just rolled my eyes  she kept on taking jabs at her but priyanka stayed composed, quick, and unbothered ️

Ellen is too rude
Everyone: quarreling about Ellen behaviour, who&#39;s more lucky Priyanka or Nick?.....Meanwhile Me: Wow that plant on table is very pretty 

Been watching indian weddings for few days now and realizing that indian wedding means inviting a huge crowd. And now wondering how to spill to my fiance and his family that I just want to elope.

Allen: “you got lucky enough to grab him?”  Nick was not even motivated in life before meeting Pri. What the heck Allen?

Seems like Ellen had a huge crush on Nick so she&#39;s trying to make the miss world feel that she&#39;s lucky!!! The thing is nick is lucky af!!

Well in west bengal, India we do invite more than 800 people  in marriage, baby shower, birthday etc ... 

So -----cute couple.feel nice ,positive, whenever watch them together. I wish they live together for ever.

Cute nga!!!!!

Ellen is totally mad

and yes, indian weddings are like that

i want to be invited to their wedding hahahahaha

REPENT!JESUS CHRIST IS COMMING SOON JEHOVAH IS THE TRUE NAME OF GOD PSALMS 83:18!

Ellen is so rude... Who&#39;s Ellen

She is not humble at all “show off

Indian wedding means - friends of friends and so on...

Guys they love each other so we really have to compare who’s luckier? They’re both lucky they met someone they love. Let it end with that

I’m just imagining her watching camp rock 2 with nick. introducing me would be perfect 

Accting like Selena Gomez

Awesome fantastic job priyanka

Now 2021 video 2 years back 2019 5 years back 2014 but it shows 2011 i found that out thats all

I love her from her show

I just wonder how beautiful she is and her confidence attracts me I want to steal her confidence perfect combo of beauty and brains

Hi
Looks like her dream has come true they are married now

Priyanka is a star in every respect....she slogged her way up there....Nick or no Nick....she is going great guns

I&#39;m Indonesian who likes Bollywood, I didn&#39;t know who is Nick Jonas or Jonas brother,  I know them from Priyanka

Ellen is the meanest evil human being alive. How’s she surprised she’s not invited to birthdays, parties, weddings. Nobody wants this negative energy

Ellen never respond to any celebrity that invites her

Priyanka Chopra is overactive female.   She thinks herself in front of Ellen as an American. Try your best and you are 100% indian.

Wait, Priyanka has been on Ellen&#39;s?!?!?

I actually went and saw the real tarrot episode

The spark in Priyanka&#39;s eyes when she talked about Indian wedding

Who came from tik tok 2020

Ellen look&#39;s like indian karan johar 
So Cool to see her using the American pronunciation instead of shi t t y indian pronunciation! It seems like the audience also like the same!.

Ellen: &quot;...super intimate, just 200 people...&quot;Me: Lady there are 1.3 billion people in our country.

There&#39;s a world out of USA...what do you mean by &#39;lucky to grab him&#39;?

Ellen needs to know that who Priyanka Chopra is PERIOD.

CALL ANANYA PANDEY

Indian weddings are long my mother&#39;s cousin&#39;s wedding was 2 days (Nikah,mehandi party) in UAE and 4 days in India we had like mehandi marriage, turmeric party, reception and I travelled for another reception in the groom&#39;s place

Oh my god how lucky is Nick Jonas He married with miss world priyanka chopra

I&#39;m no longer subscriber or Fan of Ellen bcz she dissing our boss lady PC Ellen plz don&#39;t underestimate our Baby girl

1000 people ️️
Ugh Ellen is rude from here.
Romantic couple pc nick
Nick priyanka jonas beautiful human being

Priyanka Chopra Jonas
We ,1.8 crore viewers, feel offended too, for not being invited.

Ellen sounds so hypocrite!

Well.......Nick jijaji married to an indian actor but never showed off his presence in india and especially in mumbai.......

Indian marriages are always royal.

Famous coz of her hardwork only.She needs no introduction

Nick is very lucky!

Everthing was ok.until she said &quot;you are lucky enough to grab him&quot;.

Look at Priyanka&#39;s confidence. Indians are blessed with great sense of humor.

Priyanka, the supermodel (Miss World), the movie star, the international TV star and a pop icon! She’s always made Indians proud 

Love how she handles herself despite the attacks.True Fact: NEW Bucket List item... Become a car washer for an Indian family in an attempt to someday be invited to their kid&#39;s &quot;small&quot; Indian wedding 20 years from now.

200 is so so less in Indian weddings


PC is pride of India

Fake accent fake personality

This is not anything.Her mother is totally right, we invite everyone we know from our relatives to our nearby shopkeeper, from family to maids, EVERYONE !!!

200 people in a wedding?Like this is not even 1/3 of the people that are normally invited.And to those who think that it is too much -Guys we have 1.3 billion people in our country.

We Indians even invite our relative&#39;s best friend in our marriage.

My favourite Hollywood heroine Priyanka Chopra  very beautiful 

I loved priyanka&#39;s laugh lol

She can buy jonas side of the wedding. you know.

Very true about Indian weddings!

Lol.. She did put Ellen in the spot! Priyanka can stump show hosts really! U go girl :D

Nick Jiju is awesome 🇮🇳

Millennial

Who remembers BTS gets scarred from a fan girl?

He is lucky one

Just check views of this video to find out who is more popular 

I want to hug Ellen I really love her show

Good

Pc:hey nickNick:yes mommyPc:what?Nic:what?

Here from we can be heroes

Priyanka new how to stand her ground with Ellen

Well priyanka Chopra made jonas brothers quite famous in india

Hey everyone just listen up : priyanka and nick are both lucky to have each other.

I&#39;ll come on in Lynn

I like priyanka chopra

Seriously, Ellen says Priyanka is lucky....SHE WAS ONCE MISS WORLD, WORKED IN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FOR 17 YRS, BECAME HIGHEST PAID ACTRESS OF BOLLYWOOD AND FINALLY AN INTERNATIONAL STAR........all with her own struggle.....I don&#39;t think she is the lucky one

Priyanka &amp; gal gadot sounds the same lol

Try GIN/GENEBRA hhaahhaa

Priyanka is worth a lot more than Nick Jonas and is way more popular. No Ellen whatever can even come close to her popularity!!!

Bumble is india Abu dhabi

You have muslim citizenship freelance

Red means popularity ️

I know jonas just because of PC married to him

Atleast ellen did not embarrass priyanka ...

My favorite Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra 

The complex tire characteristically pray because star histomorphometrically tremble unlike a painstaking accordion. victorious, elegant condition

Our miss world  is hereProud to be indian

She makes Jonas brothers famous in India !!!!good job

ELLEN has no idea of her power in India..so she be like ur lucky to have him..ur wrong lady he&#39;s lucky too have miss world

We didn&#39;t know Jonas before Priyanka

Nick who??? Ohh Priyanka Chopra&#39;s Husband!!!!!!!

The comment section is full of people complaining Ellen put PC down. Come on guyz, lucky hasn&#39;t got anything with importance. It&#39;s just saying, good for you getting a sweet and handsome Guy.

She is 10 yrs older than him!

Nick jonas is good but priyanka chopra is too good in our country

Awesome Honey girl let&#39;s do it , Love You Both immensely !....Cheers
Nick texted pc -&quot;we should meet&quot; What straight forward guy

I am getting a feeling that Priyanka might run for US President in future

Jonas be like yes now I am world indian famous

From this video_ we can easily know ellen is Fake .

AhaJob
It&#39;s hard to look at Priyanka&#39;s face 

Cant wait for the her to come back to the show after the divorce

<a href="">4:34</a> which show is it

<a href="">3:08</a> she coped exactly nick expression oh what an great women she is i love her

When she said Tarot cards, I heard Shahrukh Khan.

I&#39;m not Indian and I don&#39;t know who was Nick until he walked with priyanka at met gala. Before calling her lucky this ignorent Ellen should check Priyanka&#39;s achievements and her success.

Her accent 
<b>forced laugh</b>

Having 2000 or 4000 people&#39;s in  Indian wedding are common

My friend Allen

I still can&#39;t swallow the fact that priyanka chopra married Nick Jonas. More suprised on her part. In a good way

I love how Ellen n title of the video all is tryna make priyanka look awkward. But it&#39;s great to see how her lovers from across the world are backing her up.

Here , A guy had 1200 guests in wedding and 4200 guests in devorce

Ellen only likes white people. She&#39;s totally different when Jennifer Aniston is on her show.

Child marriage is not permitted in india..

They just generalize and talk about 1000 guests,  practically it doesn&#39;t happen, a middle class family I can say around 300 to 400 max people for sure. Entirely depends on how much influence you have in society.

India is great country in the world

She&#39;s trying to show what she doesn&#39;t haveGuess what ?

priyanka choopra!
What show is she in ?

They way say wife it was far more heart touching

Mad Ellen PC is best
She&#39;s sooo obnoxious and full of herself.

Anyone here from India like me

Indian girls NEEDED to be texted firstVery fine example

I reckon he is the lucky one. She is the star of bollywood.

Is that tarot card thing real?!

How come she doesn&#39;t have indian accent 

if you are wondering how the wedding can last 3 days like indian. I give an example of kazakh wedding: we invite about 1000 people, the wedding lasts for 2-3 days including pre-wedding ceremonies  it is asian thing calm down

She is hard working and working hard with different NGO to spread awareness and happiness

She started her carrer as Miss World

One thing is clear .. ️ yet there are beauties  who fall for Handsome guys. expect money lovers

I love Priyanka !! from india ️️
<a href="">0:23</a> chakhna kidhar hai bc ???
Who is here in 2021

Priyanka boasts up more

I love her accident

I love Ellen very much  I wish can meet her once in my life 
Her mom&#39;s jeweller:

Priyanka and Depika super hot

L .

Fake accent

Like throughout whole show Ellen was like Priyanka u&#39;re soo lucky to have Nick but man, literally it&#39;s the opposite. Priyanka is much more successful than Nick nd also she&#39;s miss world 2000 ( tho in relationship that doesn&#39;t matters nd both are lucky to have each other) but someone needed to give the reality check to Ellen!

America :32crore India :1.32billion I think he know that&#39;s

Not only in India... she made Jonas Brothers famous in Nepal too

Ellen a jealous hag
God I’m Indian and I didn’t know about the wedding customs. Just 3 days, a really small guest list ( just 200) 

1% people see this message your parents live more then 100 year

So Priyanka Married One Of Frankie Jonas Brothers ? Wow 

Fake accent.

Nobody will ever respect a liar and boaster!

What is this with Indians?? They always love to boast ....

Pc is a hypocrite

She pretends to be them but she didn&#39;t

I am proud because she is from India

I love her, because she is the best!

You can&#39;t found beauty like Indian&#39;s,  arab&#39;s beauty

Did Priyanka really sent the invitation to Ellen or she was lieing to maket her go speechless??

Ellen should be carefull bcz if priyanka want her indian fans alone can crash ellen&#39;s social networking sites with insult

&quot;I do need tequila everytime I&#39;m here.....&quot;

She is so hot

Ellen always tries to call out someone for not inviting her but it always backfires

Ellen being Ellen whole video trying her best to embarrass Priyanka

The real question for indians is where were you all looking ....

Check my channel i have made a video on Priyanka Chopra if u liked it Do Subscribe 

she so fake 

reminds me of Borat trying to speak English...great success!!

WOW!!!!️
She is the succesful Miss World Winner

Ellen is so rude.
The soft woolen therapeutically cheer because africa longitudinally prepare toward a reminiscent crowd. burly, honorable grass



Are you worried about saying Hindu wedding?
It&#39;s very obvious that not Priyanka buy Nick is the person who is very lucky coz he got married to the queen !!! Miss World 2000

This is so embarrassing 

Ye dress carry kaise krleti h pc  i cannot even imagine 

Nick was lucky to have the miss world. Did&#39;nt you hear? He dmed pc for a date. Moreover, in love both partners are equal

Ellen definitely brought out the tequila to see if she was pregnant, like she did with Maria Carey

Ellen you gotta try something else. Step up your game honey. It&#39;s not easy to fight back an indian women 

Dear Ellen 200 people come to our wedding without invitation.

<a href="">04:04</a>What is that show guys Anyone have that show linkShare here

Priyanka choprede pari
The poster : nick will u marry meNick :yes

James corden is way more respectful than Ellen

I don&#39;t like the way Ellen talks..

Guys I am shocked to know that it was 3 days ! Well y&#39;all, even the most basic indian wedding rituals last for 5 days , which is the standard. PC did it short .

Don&#39;t end up like her. IF YOUR INDIAN STAY WITH INDIANS!

No one:<b>Indians referring to Nick as jiju</b>

I am seeing this program for improving my English speaking skills 

No wonder Ellen accused of being toxic.Nick Jonas is lucky one,he get to be married to miss world.

<a href="">4:10</a> is false edited video, it is not true. <a href="">4:49</a> is edited card as well.

Someone in the comment section - pc is famous all bcoz of Nick and  she was just lucky enough to get him Me - Ellen is this is ur 2nd account! 

Priyanka is my fvrt fvrt actress from Don , she is very talented and after her wedding i know nick She is awesome She knows very well how to handle situation 

Serious nick is the lucky one marrying the MISS WORLD

She is so artificial

Very smart and intelligent girl.She is real mis world

<a href="">5:17</a>Bruh!She is so jealous of her and completely roasted with the fire of hatred from inside 

The pleasant timpani superiorly man because attraction lovely box plus a female fertile lock. mammoth, abhorrent tiger

, ,

Priyanka is talented 🇮🇳

Ellen - &quot;Super intimate just 200 people &quot; That made me laugh so hard 

Tarot cards reading.. I&#39;m very strongly believe in Tarot 

<a href="">1:29</a>: The woman in the blue dress. This is your future Nick. A indian Auntie when you are 40. Its only 12 years . Good luck :D

Miss WorldTop Bollywood ActressGlobal IconHollywood ActressMost Desirable Woman 2015Beautiful DancerGood SingerGlobal InfluencerModelNovelistNow guess who&#39;s lucky to have whom. Just saying. 

Was she only insulted because she is an Indian or a brown girl?

Ellen knocked out by Priyanka with that comment.... I was offended for him actually but what do I know I&#39;m just the wife. BAM!

Whoever mocked Priyanka for her too american accent in quantico... People, please notice that she is completely using Indian accent here. In an American series, one needs to pronounce English the way their people understand. The same way Katrina&#39;s hindi accent was important for Bollywood movies. I really adore Priyanka the way she ignored the vast criticism she used to get and went all the way to make her own mark globally.

Ur a lier Ellen,u aren&#39;t as polite as u appear,u hiddenly address the pissing topics for the comers!!come-on do u think we people r mad or something to not notice that bitchiness in u!!!

Priyanka is super  smart.

Middle East Asian weddings be like 
She inspired me a lot 

I feel priyanka is afraid of something I feel see fear behind her smile

The most powerful women of India .

My wedding had 7000 guests , the milk for one of the sweets alone came in four tankers no one does weddings like us indians 

Nick:  jiju of india

I cant even with that fake accent

She’s so beautiful

She spent crores for only 200 people. We spent like 60 lacks and fed like 5000 people.

Ellen is just ignorant..

e w

She strikes one as a dominatrix

She looks really beautiful and strong 

Salutes to priyanka for the way she takes those questions and smiles on it. I wish someone clever n witty was there for her to answer such mocking questions. Lots of love &amp; strength to PC.

Shahrukh khan please Ellen

She should have went: Is this Villa One?

Ellen is like priyanka has been done a favor to, for marrying Nick. I think she&#39;s more attractive and awe inspiring than nick. Nick has got much more than what he deserves. He had been dating dumb popstars until recently. And priyanka is extremely intelligent. Only thing I don&#39;t like about her is, she is way too animated, moves too much. Very distracting.

ELLEN IS A JEALOUS JUSTIN BIEBER JR.

ELLEN LOOKS LIKE JUSTIN BIEBER JR. 
When i saw jumanji n saw nick i was like he is kinda cute but I came to know about him only when priyanka got engaged

Ellen literally tries to represent non westerners as low standards.. she did it with Priyanka, BTS and many more

We are proud........

I&#39;m Arab in our countries 22 Bollywood more famous than Hollywood

yes i am an indian and i have been a  jonas brothers fan since camp rock &lt;3

Priyanka looks boring...trying to show she fits there lol

Open your eyes in the last days ..For What is the deal if you gain the whole world but stil lose your own soul wake up️REPENT ......

She is sooo beautiful that skin color on her ️

Nick&#39;s so lucky to grab her!!

just like aliens movies, Allen also thinks USA=Globe !

Ellen you are the best

Priyanka is amazing. ️

ugliest lady of the world priyanka, not lady not man

She is really very hard working and charming personality. Respect P.C️

For my brother&#39;s wedding there were nearly 6000+ guests

“You are lucky enough to grab him” bruh!! I am not Indian but i got little offended to be honest. Dude was in elementary school when Priyanka was wearing crown for miss world!! Lol . Anyways they both are happy with each other and we should be happy for them. They both are lucky to have each other as an husband and wife.

Elken has no idea  who she is . She was on cover on time magazine and unicef embasador before she met the guy . More successful ,more richer,more fans and now she made nick jonas famous .he got pulled out from the grave.

whatever shoib malik is still indian&#39;s favorite jiju 

Indian weddings are full of enjoyment with dance, food and happiness ️

I can say one thing.... Abt Nick he is loyal coz he is my brother I don&#39;t know when he changed his name

Both are lucky....

Malayali puliya da….motiv
Im from East Africa and Never know The Jonas Brothers until Jonas get married to PC...But i always knew PC..

Is that tarot card real?

I love Pri because she worked hard to get to where she is now, and not relying on Nick&#39;s empire. Everyone says that she is using Nick for the money and fame, but really I think that she probably has more money than Nick, and she worked hard for everything she has. She really deserves everything that she has now.

things us indians do to get a green card, how desperste she is

Fact is priyanka is more famous than nick

Luv ya, Priyanka ur amazing...
I never thought Nick Jonas was going to be a part of India, never

PC is using her both hands all the time . Anyway,I like her.

I love the way by she is questioning.️
I came to know about Jonas after priyanka married him

The host is somewhat insulting Priyanka especially in the end, you are lucky to have grabbed him. This is ridiculous. They like each other. They got married. What is the grabbing stuff

Ellen Degeneres is &quot;self made&quot; &amp; sometimes she&#39;s forgetting to look back where she came from making her mean in doing all her celebrity interviews. She has to maintain being in a&quot;low profile&quot; putting her guests in an embarassing &amp; confused situation. She needs a good, healthy flow of conversation mentally &amp; emotionally to make her show more joyful, enjoyable, normal &amp; an entertaining experience, okay Ellen? Thanks!

My dr&#39;s last name is Chopra &amp; I don&#39;t know if she was Indian or not. She was only filling-in for my regular dr on the phone but she was very nice, smart &amp; sharp &amp; upbeat. It&#39;s Jonas who&#39;s so lucky to marry her for her beauty, brilliant talent, success &amp; popularity &amp; everything to name a few. I wish the couple &quot;all the best&quot; &amp; find eternal peace, love &amp; happiness! God bless them together!

Ellen does not realise how many people are jealous of Nick and hating on him become he is married to Priyanka, or maybe she realises but just brushes it away.

How the hack she is miss world.

Ellen need to learn to treat foreigners

HINDUSTHAN me lrke kya mr gye the PUCHTA HAI BHARAT

Priyanka talking about how Ellen didn’t respond to the invitation, reminded me of Dakota.

ram ranch

I haven&#39;t heard Nick Jonas&#39;s name before their marriage , man this Ellen is freaking uneducated and am so sick of her.

Isn’t Priyanka Chopra GenX though?

Horoscope ....nailed it ...gosh

Deep down, Ellen was not kinda comfortable with the fact Nick married her.

Ellen says &quot; You&#39;re just lucky enough to grab him&quot; seriously??? Ellen is such a mean person....

In half of the part Priyanka was just showing off 

In our indian weddings 1000 guests is like only 200 

In Indian wedding our UnclesWork as a waiter

For my wedding it&#39;s just 1500 people 

I usually talk like priyanka,  but lose my accent for some difficult words lol..

Indeed Priyanka Aunty is the Lucky one to grab the nationality of US...Remember they are epicenter of the world well developed advanced and on the otherhand India is still developing

Bollywood eats bananas, Angres eats bananas, she married a boy after the age of her child, Bhuddi
ellen tried to roast her and got roasted back loll

Awesome priyanka

Ellen has a way of explaining everything...Congratulations to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas...TRUE LOVE.

Ellen tried eveytime to prove she was, gold digger an humiliated her but she gave every answer with so much fun  love u priyanka 

&quot;Lucky enough to grab him &quot; Ellen has idea what she is saying. Priyanka is wayyyyyy beyond his league. Look at her dating history the guys she has dated in the past are not even close to him. Nick was really lucky to grab her!

I never thought: those women are so lucky, they married these handsome Men. I always thought: holy moly those Boys married such beautiful Women!

Nick is lucky af to grab her don&#39;t forget who she is.....PC we love You

I loved how pc speak the truth, ellen is really rude in real life!

Indian weddings are dope asf, and I’m mexican 

How many indians are here

They married in Jodhpur...That&#39;s where I live!!!!

Look her accent... totally looking she is trying to copy them

I&#39;m experiencing severe second hand embarrassment for India on watching this.

How fun lol her wedding seems like it must have been so fun

Ellen is a degenerate...so boring

Priyanka Chopra ️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️she is so talented ️
Ellen is very judgemental.

Who else think it&#39;s amazing show rise hand ?

I was shock that there were only 200 people. I thought atleast 500 people attended the wedding

<a href="">4:06</a>

Priyanka is lucky to have nick jonas

Im the only one who is distracted by  .....

Wait a second......last she said that Priyanka is lucky to grab Nick I mean really Nick Jonas is not famous worldwide like Justin Bieber I don&#39;t know Nick before their marriage.

ĞpeaAwzwBen sana ....&quot;?..&quot;?
Well...i m from india....and in the lockdown we have our sister&#39;s marriage...and 50 guests were allowed from both sides due to ....but guests arrived are nearly 70.......but we tried a lot to invite less guests.....

Queen️
Priyanka Married Nick.Plot Twist :  Priyanka adopted Nick...
Both are famous in their own world, I never knew about Prianka, till she got marry with Jonas, Jonas is so famous in all America.America doesn’t know about Bollywood and those things so I am happy to know her culture . Greetings from Bolivia 🇧🇴

Fun fact : All Indians know Nick because of Priyanka Chopra.. Because he is the jiju of our country..

My wedding is 1000 people...that is true..

we have more than 200 people for birthdays

Ouch ellen u did it again. You were invited and u lied to camera. PC and dakota dont play baby

Jitne log priynka mam ki shadi me aaye the,  utne toh hamare yaha naraj hue baithate hai... 🇮🇳

She reminds me of Drew Berrymore

She so pretty 

Ellen DeGeneres is the mean person in Hollywood

I’m Pakistani and the weddings last 7 days with like 5000 people

and because of this sweet lil honey called Covid... We Indians haven&#39;t still figured out how to marry without  inviting our wedding guests :(

India&#39;s proud of you PC

Hahahaha  she trolled  priyanka especially that indian show   hahahahaAs an indian it feels so funny and still so embrassing  oh god im dyingg!!!

Gg. Bzizs.

I am watching Hollywood movies since childhood but I never knew Jonas, on the other hand Priyanka wore the crown of Miss World, she was a big celebrity by herself, she has done movies like Barfi and Fashion, she didn&#39;t grab him, they both deserve each other. And 1000 people is nothing in an Indian wedding, my parents got married in 1990 and they invited 600 people. That is very common India. Ellen has no idea how big celebrity Priyanka is.

Oh Corona just made it  only 100 all around the marriages...else it is India or wherever

<a href="">4:07</a> the footage doesn&#39;t looks real. If u notice the angle and the background.

I LOVE YOU

It does not feel like Ellen likes her

Marriage is festival in india

My fav show Quantico

Ellen seems so ignorant on how big Priyanka is. Nick Jonas known as Jonas Brothers &amp; that&#39;s all. Oh God... Most people around the world knew who Priyanka way more than who is Nick Jonas.

Not all way some time’s yes and some time’s no  yah  lol  I been honest and my turn life now    Tall you more tonight is because how  it is to me   I may make on time  not make tall 5

&quot;You are lucky to  grab him&quot;Oh please , check Priyanka&#39;s achievement first , I think Nick is lucky he got miss world.

Priyanka ,you wore dirty dress , shameless girl,

Shopie really like Queen

This makes so much sense now ..Ellen didn&#39;t respond to their wedding invite....

Are people forgetting that Priyanka is a BIG thing? She’s India’s love and she made it to Hollywood HERSELF so nick is also lucky to get her.

At my wedding there were 1500 people which was less as per indian standards 

I grew up *watching the Jonas brothers and Priyanka&#39;s someone I&#39;ve always looked up to as the boss lady she is. So I was really happy for Nick. He&#39;s really lucky.

Wow Ellen is telling PC she&#39;s lucky to grab Nick? I think after dating and dumping every well known female celeb in tinseltown Nick will say he&#39;s lucky to have Priyanka!

She is right 200 is actually less man Im from bangladesh and my family is not so rich but still we have 3000 or 4000 people  in our weddings And the wedding lasts for 6 days or 1 week atleast  if they r muslim and fir hindus its longer. And plus there are functions post wedding tooo And i wish the same too i want all my relatives, friends  to be there for me.. 

Even non indian ppls are against her grabing statment ànd still she is in so arrogance

Proud to be an Indian I mean she is an indian and make india proud these two actresses deepika and priyanka make India feel proud love you guys

I am surpise when a white guys married to an east Indian women, i didn&#39;t know that easy Indian people can married outside the race

Woww beautiful lady...beautiful
Is it just me or Ellen DeGeneres Ma’am is totally trying to belittle her..

Yo Ellen when I hit my puberty we invited 300 people for that function and it was just a limited people only from my mother&#39;s side

I liked Ellen ..Not anymore

She&#39;s so hot

tell me about a huge family i can relate to that so much!

When she says  &quot;Indian Wedding&quot; and you realize there goes her fake accent out of line

Priyanka jada style mat mar
I almost thought she married bangbros

She fails to talk like an American

Did you see how she lied at <a href="">4:25</a> about &#39;knowing the show&#39; just for the moment and then recovered from it!!

Well,she might be lucky but he is luckier. You should know the kind of well deserved status Priyanka has in India.

Me 3000 lol

Comments = 4.9kLikes on comments = 12 k

Tarot cards = shahrukh khan
I think the video of priyanka waving with board and nick jonas picture on card are morphed.they are not realI didnt knew Ellen was fake

Super intimate, just 200 members 

Super intimate 200
We sometimes even attend weddings of strangers just to have fun

200 is like the neighbors only

Priyanka have such a charm that she can get anything So we can&#39;t say she is lucky

She should have adopted him as a son

300 is minimum for middle class indian and 100 gm gold is minimum given to daughter or girl of house along with necessary utilities .In short ,dad spends his big part of savings on his daughter one day marriage ..

She’s so cute ️ she reminds me of a toddler

My elder brother wedding was small 800 people but 1000 people because all happened in 7 days of planning because brother was in india for 15 days

Shiv Sena might had kidnapped her or made mirzapur 2 if she had been to India. Good decision Ellen.

For those who are saying they had 1k guests , 2k guests , we are 1.35 Billion people i just wanna say its not a proud thing.

I think the average guests in India are like 2k-3k

I came to know about Nick jonas after PC dated him...

I married a gorgeous Indian man. I am deeply private and only wanted 30 people there. He couldn&#39;t believe it  he was so shocked that we were even going for less than 300 people (which is very small for them). We settled on 140, he still goes on about how small it was.

For them.. 200 is very limited. They coulda probably had 4000 guests ffs.

We gotta admit she&#39;s the most Successful Indian Celebrity

She&#39;s pride of India 🇮🇳

Most of the people in India know Jonas brothers due to PC. He&#39;s just an average boy next door type. Many Bollywood male actors are more handsome and educated than him.

Nick is that hot????? Okay then.

Opens up about the wedding. She only said how many people there were. Sooouuhh clickbaity

I like how Ellen tried calling her out for not inviting her to the wedding but it totally backfired. Hahaha!

I am from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳 and when I watching this video I think about BTS  

I love Ellen! ️️
Iam from Chennai for my sister&#39;s wedding 5500 people came

When I was in college and I want a feast then we get dressed and went whole group for a single invite...

Ellen is being not nice to Priyanka Chopra. Now her real personality is showing off. Here she looked so condesending and down right insulting. She always complain about not being invited but in reality she does see any invites (same as Dakota Johnson).

Hi
