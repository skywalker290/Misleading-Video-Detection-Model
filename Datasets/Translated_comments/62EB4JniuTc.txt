I remember when I was only excited for Falcon and the winter solider and I remember saying how will a Loki project work… until then we had Peak that we did not see coming

Loki is the best series

Bro I miss these days with these 3 shows, the nostalgia. I do feel old now

When marvel was cinema

I MISS THESE DAYS

Loki  said  he will burn this place to the ground but he never did lol

Loki burning the place down 

Back when we were so hyped for disney olus shows

So hype

We’re old
All the comments all the hype for the mcu coming back after endgame and nearly everything since has been a dud

<a href="">0:26</a> Loki was right  Its burnt to ground now 

Like it 
Can&#39;t believe this was 3 years ago

inhumans MARVEL STUDIOS MCU DISNEY KEVIN FEIGE SIM  POR FAVOR  
Woah! Watching back on this now still gives me goosebumps! Hahah

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 yrs already!

It had so much potential and they turned Mcu into Dceu (absolute Doggshit)

Deadpool 3 No  ️No ️ ‍️️️ No ️ ‍️  ️ No ️  Marvel Studios ️ No️  ️ No  No️ No ️No ️  Marvel Studios ️
Who remembers?

Loki 
<a href="">0:09</a> - <a href="">0:14</a> or <a href="">0:09</a> -  <a href="">0:16</a> is the best soud ever

this is still such an epic teaser

Loki just has 3 sec, but he killed it!WandaVision still blows me away, even after two years.

well yea the universe is expanding and it gonna be awsome and so all those shows have been moved in 2021 and 2022 but it was so awsome.

Thank you marvel and Disney+ for this amazing shows !! We loved all of them ️️

still such a good trailer

I’m excited for Loki Season 2

Anyone back here after we&#39;ve seen it all?

Who is here after MoM?

<a href="">0:24</a>

you have no idea how long I&#39;ve been searching this teaser for WV with the &quot;Vision residents&quot; line.....

I remember when this trailer just came out, I feel like WandaVision is really weird and I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT. And here we are after MoM dropped. What an experience.

I want to feel this vibe like the first time againn 

This trailer is better than some of the shows tbh

Can’t believe this was 2 years ago. I remember feeling so hyped.

anyone else here while moon knight is going on

What an experience

Wanda Welcome Home <a href="">0:12</a>
Rewatching it in 2022 and i just realized the aspect ratio shown for Falcon and the Winter Soldier and WandaVision are different

Looking back on this big game spot in 2022. Congratulations to Marvel Studios for executing these series and more on Disney +. Phase 4 is off  to an amazing start!!!!

Music?

I also came back to get chills 

I just came back here to get some chills

Does anyone have the sound ??

Loki had such a badass line.

They should have done a trailer like this when they announced the Netflix shows are going to disney+

I miss the time when this trailer first came out :( the hype was real

I remember this

Well isn’t 2020 a goddamn lie 
No one expected Wandavision to be so important for Multiverse of MadnessI kept telling everyone they should watch itSome did not but not us

It's time
That was 2 years ago??? That&#39;s crazy!

I can&#39;t believe this is two years old already!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

This was the moment when nobody&#39;s getting that much hyped for WandaVision. And now...

Come on Marvel give us a 2022 version for Moon Knight, She-Hulk and Ms Marvel 

I hope they have a regular full spot for Doctor Strange MOM and they have another in this type of mix-up format for the Disney+ shows coming this year (MoonKnight, She/Hulk, Ms Marvel and Secret Invasion)

Whats the name of the song tho

It’s crazy how COVID messed everything up. All these shows were supposed to come out 2020

ngl marvel needs to drop another trailer like this one

2022 is gonna be even crazier!!!

i keep coming back to this

Can I Get Up Now

A look back at all of these, cool as hell.

Marvel is incredibly amazing...
I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve all already seen these shows.

Who&#39;s here after watching no way home. What a year for marvel and their fans. Thanks goodness ️

It’s crazy how it’s already been a year....

I’m so glad these shows came out this yesr

This is just so good

Loki can take my heart with just 5 seconds of talking

Loki Best ️
what a ride it was

This was seriously over a year ago!?

Don&#39;t mind me. Just came here after today&#39;s Disney+ day for Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Miss Marvel, What If?, Loki, Secret Invasion and more. Man the marvel universe really is expanding.

Still goosebumps.
Honestly, I&#39;ve seen all these shows so many times now, but watching this, remembering the overanalysing of every last bit of it was so fun

Big game? nah.BIG SHOT &gt;:)
hopin we get another one of these for disney plus day this year with Ms Marvel, Moon Knight and She Hulk

The music.

At home releases should be released in this aspect ratio. I don&#39;t understand the point of cropping it down to 21:9. Forget your story reasons. Show me the whole image. Why are you withholding screen information I know you have. If you wont do it for the movies, then dont do it for the TV shows. Except WandaVision. Alright, your story reasons are validated when it&#39;s presented in that style. Otherwise STOP CROPPING THE FRAME

It&#39;s crazy how it&#39;s already a year, and all of these shows are all out

the mandalorian season 1: <b>ends</b>other people: <b>unsubscribe disney+</b>me: <b>CONTINUE WATCHED TFATWS</b>

Who&#39;s here after Venom: Let There Be Carnage new trailer?

WandaVision, The Falcon And The Winter Soldier and Loki are some of the best content the MCU has put out.

“The Universe is Expanding”Same tag line uses in the venom trailer right before Cledus kills a spider ....

So who is here after Wandavision, Falcon &amp; winter soldier and Loki

I remember watching the super bowl with my friends and we were all blasted so when this came on Ong we were all screaming

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already over, Hawkeye we&#39;re ready for you now!

Am I the only one or does anyone else still gets goosebumps seeing this?

Oh sh there more I thought Loki flacon and the winter solider and Wanda vision there more dr strange and spider man and much more

In 20211. Falcon and the winter soldier  amazing 2. Wanda vision nice  3. Loki that&#39;s amazing super    4. Sang - chi brilliant  new super hero amazing superb mast5. Venom let there be carnage going to be a big fight   6. Eternels please do in hindi Marvel - India hai chalta hai7. Spider man no way home That&#39;s gazab fire .

God dam it I don’t have Disney plus

Song?

I am the 11,111th Comment on this video.

I’d argue some of the best ships are in those three shoes

Thanks for recommending me this 1 year later youtube.

Why is being recommended after a year?

Great, but where&#39;s Daredevil Season 4?

Anyone else here after all three of these shows have ended?

Hi

Lomki 
That scene of Loki is nowhere in the T.V. show. Why did Disney/Marvel lie?

Me here after all the shows released remembering how happy I was when this released

Annnnd they&#39;re all finished. Feels like yesterday this came out.

Who else is here after completing WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki??

Wanda vision show disappointment show the falcon and the winter soldier is a good show Loki is the best show mind blowing master piece review from future

remembering 2019 when this played during the Superbowl and blew my cousin&#39;s brain.

Now this gives me so much nostalgia

Someone here after watching all three?

Time flies lol
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate these shows now they are all out!

Loki ended and the only thing we had was a scene that never existed (but he said the line)

Here after finishing Loki season 1. All three of these were entertaining. Some may not share my opinion, but I thought all three shows were good for different reasons.

Welcome to the Multiversal war.. Glorious purpose..

looking back, our expectations for these shows were too high because of Endgame but there were enjoyable moments

Nice to see almost all these shows wrap up nicely after so long  (any Loki enjoyers?)

Here after all 3 shows finished. They were amazing!! Just like this trailer

Just came back after watching all three, GOOSEBUMPS!!!

Who is here after the season finale of Loki? It&#39;s incredible that we already have all these series 

watching this again after the finale of LOKI hits different :3

I&#39;m so satisfied after watching all of these series...

After finishing LOKI ?

Random kid in 2050:This thing sucks

Funny how this TV Spot has only one scene from Loki and now all these series have ended and Loki has been renewed for another season. Crazy how time flies.

Who is here after all the shows are fully out?

All three shows are now finished, and after Loki, I think it’s safe to say that the title needs to change. <b>The multiverse is expanding.</b>

And now I have completed all three of these series

Finally after watching these three i must say i am gonna miss them.

1 year ago: This will never happenToday: Finished all 3!!!

And now all of the 3 ended. Time really flies

Loki Episode 6 Spoiler Kang the Conqurer
crazy seeing this after all the shows are done. wandavision- 8/10     tfatws- 8/10  Loki- 9/10

that was a fun ride for about 6 months.Falcon &gt; Loki &gt; WandaVision

Excellent
The trilogy ends today with loki episode 6.

And that concludes all three tv shows of the MCU’s Phase 4, can’t wait for more in the future.

This place to the ground ,is it finale of loki

Kinda weird looking back at this now lol

Don’t mind me <a href="">0:24</a>
This trailer showed Loki 17 months before it came out

Am I missing something from the Loki clip is it not in the series or was it a way to let fans know the tva was gonna show up in it?

loki so hot
Omg... I&#39;m starting to believe the Loki scene in this trailer will be the end of the serie.

Why did I get recommended this over a year later 

Who is here after loki serious out?

this whole trailer makes so much more sense now that those shows are out!

I miss this era of uncertainty what would come

Who is here after Wandavision , Falcon and the winter Soldier and loki release

Can&#39;t believe this is 1 yr ago

Damm me after finishing wandavision falcon and the winter soldier and half way through Loki

Retrospectively, all these shows keep blowing my mind. I can’t believe the quality being put forth by Marvel on Disney+

It only took one year for us to see all of these shows

Remember when we first saw this? Marvel did not disappoint at all!

This gave me chills...in a good wayAnd wandavision is the best!&quot;Vision residence!&quot;

Turning here when you have watch all the series (Loki actually) and all theses sequences make sense !

Who is watching when loki is out

Falcon and winter soldier - I&#39;m 4 episodes in out of 6, Falcon still doesn&#39;t have the shield... And this trailer came out a year ago. How long did this series take to make anyway?

That line at <a href="">0:25</a> makes me smile every time I hear it. I don&#39;t know why.

Loving seeing this now with 1 more episode of falcon and winter solder left. It all make sense now!

It&#39;s still giving me chills

I come from the future and these series totally amazing

<a href="">0:21</a> I know you guys won’t believe me but as soon as I saw this clip I knew that this wasn’t Steve but a new replacement Captain America.

&quot;exclusively on dinsey plus&quot;Me whos watching it on goojara for free and on very exact dates

Marvel should kept this &#39;<a href="">0:11</a>&#39; scene away from spot.

I thought Wandavision was about Wanda and vision having a happy life together boy was I wrong  :(

This was released 1 Year Ago Wow , time really flys .

Who&#39;s after FALCON AND WINTER SOLDIER ?

In TFATWS at <a href="">0:06</a> when he throws the shield at the tree it is empty, but in the show it is the punching bags cgied on the tree

C&#39;m on what did you expect ,of course I&#39;ll watch this trailer after watching WandaVision and Falcon&amp;TheWinterSoldier

Falcon&#39;s training montage was the best part of the episode.

The nostalgia looking back to that moment in early February 2020.Not because it was pre-pandemic, but because we knew so little and had like 8 seconds of material per show

<a href="">00:14</a>

black wido game
dang, time flies...

Epic

<a href="">0:10</a> is gonna come in next episode. Calling it now

can&#39;t believe this was 1 year ago

Nostalgia...
Pls soundtrack name pls pls pls

<a href="">0:25</a> is something I will put as my yearbook quote when I graduate

Who&#39;s here after Wandavision finale

Hey guys! Well, we&#39;re still alive even learning how to live through a pandemic and Disney+ finally arrived (back in Dec in Brazil) and the Marvel Studios series are amazing! WandaVision just finished and they have a lot more to deliver yet.So be safe out there hoping that one day we will go back to theaters watch more Marvel movies!

Who&#39;s here after falcon and the winter soldier released!!

So even after an year this Tv Spot is lit............Falcon and the Winter Soildier comes out tomorrow

DISNEY FDP, TE AMO CARALHOOOOOOOOOO!

looking back we got WandaVision episode 8 footage in this

One down. Two to go.
Loki&#39;s one scene in big game spot made whole spot awesome..

This trailer gives me goosebumps even a year later.

Boy, we had no idea what WandaVision was about!

Wandavision WAS INCREDIBLY AMAZING.

Do you guys know which soundtrack is this?

So who else is here after the finale of Wanda vision

Yeah it&#39;s been agatha all along

<a href="">0:11</a> this hits different after watching WandaVision :((

Its like a dream i mean wandavision&#39;s ended and next falcon and the winter soldier

Who’s watching this after the wandavision finale

who&#39;s here when wandavision now finished lol

We just don&#39;t know what to expect

<a href="">0:18</a> so this is the climax of the wandavision, but as usual marvel did their best not to put effects on it so we have no idea back then

<b>Vision dies</b>WANDA: I don&#39;t think so

Ohhh they changed the thumbnail

Anyone else here after the Wandavision finale?

Hi

Who&#39;s after WandaVision ends?

Wanda is now the scarlet witch

Who else is here after Wandavision has ended

Randomly recommended?

Netflix = You don&#39;t have quality diney+ =Marvel= Are you sure about that <b>Btw Who is excited for wandavision finale ,5th march</b>

Those wandvision teases are so nostalgic

 waiting for last episode of WandaVision 
its been an year?

That scene at <a href="">0:18</a> was the <b>the scene</b> I&#39;ve been waiting for and I was not disappointed. Very clever of them removing the vfx (and changing the tv screen) because it really set the stage for this being some sort of some mysterious &quot;alternate reality&quot; in modern times (with her being in colour/in her modern clothes and vision in b&amp;w), yet it didn&#39;t really spoil anything.

<a href="">0:17</a> Wanda creating Vision 1 year ago

<a href="">0:11</a> ️️️
<a href="">0:18</a> they hide the main reveal of the  series in plain sight that too in the very first scene they released for wandavision. CLEAVER!

Where&#39;s daredevil

<a href="">00:18</a> finally this part makes sense
Song name xd

This already feels like five years ago.

Wandavision part of the trailer hits different now.

<a href="">0:18</a>  wow that&#39;s how it looks without the hex effects

They literally spoiled ep 8 here

Really interesting WandaVision scenes... one in particular...

Like Infinity War, they use the biggest spoiler as clips in the trailer with no context and no CGI. They&#39;re so good at deception in trailers, it&#39;s awesome.

I kept wondering throughout the season what the WandaVision clips was all about and when we’d see it and now, I’m completely satisfied

Anyone from Wanda vision S01 Ep 08?

It Was Agatha All Along! 
i cant believe this trailer dropped a year ago

When you realize that <a href="">0:12</a> to <a href="">0:14</a> is a scene from the second to last episode! SPOILERS!!!

This Scene was in today&#39;s episode [Ep.08] where Wanda recreated vision <a href="">0:18</a> and I cant believe that no one talked about it before.

Love how they use the climax of wandavision here without the full visual effects.. They&#39;ve really upped their game in trailer deceptions.

<a href="">0:18</a> We now know the context!

Okay I need this audio but as a 3 minute version and an accompanying album of badass trailer music.

Anyone else here after the 9th WandaVision episode?Edit: Thank you for the 1 like person of the intenret

That &quot;Wanda&quot; at <a href="">0:10</a> is so touching now, man. Poor Wanda

The Scarlet Witch!!!

Here after WandaVision episode 8
<a href="">0:18</a> finally got this in wandavision

<a href="">0:18</a> i’m waiting for this moment

when watching the Wanda vision scenes in this trailer when it first came out  I was really confused and now episode 7 came out a couple days ago and it’s all coming together

“WandaVision will be the show that kills Marvel” ...like Selena Gomez say...will LOOK AT HER NOW.! This show is straight up pippin’ 

This legit said “The universe is expanding” So it’s either multiverse or just new and more characters coming to this franchise

<a href="">0:18</a> WE STILL HAVENT SEEN THIS PART IN WANDAVISION

no manches aparese quiqusilver de evan peters
Wandavision

<a href="">0:18</a> when does this happen? episode 7? episode 8?

Loki has two moods.Stealing the tesseract.Or just dying and coming back.

<a href="">00:19</a>

I remember rewatching this to know what&#39;s actually going on in those shows but now we&#39;re at last 3 episodes of WandaVision and next month we&#39;re gotta get FATWS wahuu!!

oooops fox quicksilver
oh the universe is expanding alright 

one year later we barley get wanda vision

well the first one was a bit weird lol

Released: 2021-01-15

<a href="">0:19</a> well if you&#39;ve watched the ending of WandaVision eps 6, that LINE wasn&#39;t lying!

Poor Replay-Button

Im back a year later after they dropped the ACTUAL trailer for Falcon and Winter Soldier. Now that they released Wandavision I already know its gonna be good ahhhhhh

Who else is here a year later because of new Falcon and the Winter Soldier trailer came out?

Yes... one year has passed. A lot has happened in that year.

Who else is here after the official trailer of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier?

ay 2021 game day! more trailers :)
Here after Wandavision has aired 5 episodes and they released a full trailer for Falcon and the Winter Soldier on the next Superbowl

You can’t tell me this is a coincidence considering the Super Bowl is hours away!

I&#39;m here just for Loki 

This came up on the same day as NFL? Looks like we’re getting more trailers tonight!

Funny how they could just re-use this trailer and it would still be relevant

1 year ago

A year later and every show except for WandaVision is about to have 2 SuperBowl Trailers 

Who else got recommended this in the date of Super Bowl 2021?

Its been one year since this video upload.. Jezz i thought i was like just like 5 months.

Let’s hope we get something like this again today

Who&#39;s after wandavision released

Hard to believe this was over a year ago

Lmao y&#39;all trying to get more hints about Wandavision so it brought you back here

how was this teaser 1 year ago

Who’s ready for trmws trailer

Who&#39;s here, re-watching, ready for this year&#39;s Super Bowl?

Who’s here right before the Super Bowl?

This is still so hype

1 year ago

Music Question: Composer - Track Name?

A year ago?!
Who else got this in their recommended

Why is this on everyone’s recommended page after 1 year?

who&#39;s here after watching wandavision episode 5?

Anyone else here after realizing that the first of these shows is just now starting to air a year after this video was released

This came out a year ago 
They didn’t lie when they meant that “The Universe Is Expanding” after Episode 5 of WandaVision

One Year

To think that now I can watch Wandavision... I'm getting old, this came out 1 year ago
It&#39;s so crazy how long we&#39;ve been waiting for WandaVision. It&#39;s been over a year!

&quot;She recast piatro?&quot;

Who is here after Quicksilver appearence on chapter 5 of WandaVision?

That was a year ago 

We made it!

I wonder what the Marvel trailer for this year&#39;s Super Bowl will include. Stuff for Falcon and Winter Soldier, Black Widow and Loki for sure but what if they include tiny teases of Shang-Chi and Eternals in there? (We&#39;ll have to see on Sunday)

ME: doesn&#39;t anyone know how to be original. Every comment uses the same played was format. ME AGAIN IN CASE YOU FORGOT: now I forgot writing in this stupid way

1 year ago

Weird to think this was a year ago

Who has watched 4 episodes of Wanda Vision

Already 1 year

I cant believe it&#39;s been a year since this was released

1 year ago, i can&#39;t believe it

Exactly a year ago

been one year

Anyone else here a year later for no reason. Crazy too see how much has changed

happy birthday to this video

One year

Finally, after almost a year has passed, we have MCU content again!!

Was this really 11 months ago??! I remember when it was the only thing we had for these shows. Now here we are with two episodes of WandaVision!!

Waiting for Loki️
When she says visions residence it&#39;s so soothing and lovely ️️

Dang almost a year old and we got one of them

It took them a little over 11 months just to put one of these shows up

Its crazy how this is almost a year old and almost none of these have been released except 2 episodes of Wandavision

It took just under a year for this lol. Also did the Wanda welcome hope happen or do you think we’ll see that later?

You know the casting is sublime when everyone says six seconds of Tom/Loki results in them giving Disney their money.

The almost complete pack, Matt Murdock and Frank Castle aren&#39;t there :(

<a href="">0:23</a>

I cannot put into words how much hype this 30 second trailer can create

Dear Marvel I&#39;m starving please release something........!!!!!!!

Thor : Alive Loki : Alive (aGuAiN) Hela : ...

Super excited for LokI

Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow

You forgot Black Widow :&#39;(

still no tfatws content 

don&#39;t mind me, just rewatching this video for the 152639462 time

Lot by the time this trailer becomes 1 year old, only Wandavision will have come out.

Coming soon is not soon

I could watch this 5 million times in a row and it would still give me chills

anyone watching in 2021 ...wait ,,,,,,wtf

Marvel and Disney: trio marvel studios series are this year Coronavirus: on your left boys plus the worlds changing so it’s y’all change too dates for the shows Wandavision December 2020Falcon and the winter soldier may 2021?Loki spring 2021

Tony star has any chance for comeback

I just realised this: did Vision ever show his teeth (if he had any) in the MCU movies?

Imagine if these 8 series were hbomax serie for the dceu:1-zatanna:a fantasy /horror show that focus on zatanna and the magic side of the dceu 2-green arrow &amp; black canary: the big bad will be the ninth circle and also some member of the jsa will appear(this is due to black canary connections to them)  3-static shock:this will deal with metahuman, gang/gun violence and  schooldrop out4-vandal savage:this will follow the journey of the immortal savage thrue history as we see him as he walk the line of hero and villain  5-the question: a detective noir series taking place in the 1970&#39;s and the main character is conspiracy theory vic sage. 6-martian manhunter:this is about jon jonnz working in the shadows for/with the D. E. O figting/helping aliens hiding on earth. Since the movie aren&#39;t doing anything with him why not use him for tv series 7-the atom 8-DC showcase:this will be animated and do one off episode for other dc characters thrue different eras(past, present &amp; futur) and are cannon to the dceu continuity, characters such as vixen, adam strange, jonah hex, plastic man, the black hawks, etrigan, firestorm, the omegamen

Can’t wait for The U.S.Agent!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
nat geo is a part of this?

WandaVison is gonna be the best thing

I came from the future to say that 2020 is like Thanos snaping his fingers like a hundred times

Loki 
I can watch this all day

It always ends in a fight

On your Left

Only Marvel can increase the hype in just 30 seconds.

By seeing Audience reaction on Wandavision.   I&#39;m waiting disasters on Loki series.

Alot of people don&#39;t know that this trailer exist

Loki made full teaser awesome

If u could notice...the man whom bucky was threatening was Helmut Zemo...That means he either escaped from the jail and continues his quest to destroy the remaining avengers...or he was released and continues it

Tfw Falcon and the Winter Soldier should’ve been out already 

who are watching this video again and again only for loki&#39;s clip?

I LOVE HOW THE BULLETS COME OUT OF HIS HAND AND WITH THE SOUND

<a href="">0:10</a> OH MYY GOOD YESS, MY TWO FAV CHARACTERS :00

Can y&#39;all believe the WandaVision trailer came out before the Falcon and the Winter Soldier?

<a href="">0:25</a>

One of the best teasers in history

Who&#39;s here after seeing WandaVision&#39;s trailer. We&#39;re so hyped

Both of them apart I am waiting for &quot;Loki&quot;

As a huge Marvel and Star Wars fan, it&#39;s a shame that I can&#39;t use Disney + in my country.

Music name please ?

<a href="">0:25</a>Gender Reveal Party
<b>Who is watching again after releasing WandaVision trailer?</b> 

Who here after the 1st Wandavision trailer still waiting for these shows ???

WandaVision • Wanda’s Vision (Her imagination)• Wanda and Vision (featuring Both characters)• Wanda-Vision (play on the word Television)Dammm Marvel... that was SMART

anyone know from which song are the beats used from?

Ok so now just seeing the WandaVision trailer, I’m hoping that Falcon and Winter Soldier has The Boys vibes to it, WandaVision continues with what they’re doing, and Loki has vibes of Umbrella Academy

Im here aftr the WandaVision trailer

Subscription confirmed with just one Loki quote...
who is here after wandavision trailer.

Who&#39;s here after the Wandavision trailer?

Is it me or is the theme song really awesome?

Who is here after Wanda Vision trailer ?

I&#39;m so scared that I won&#39;t get wandavision

They said coming soon 7 months ago

7 months later finally got another trailer for one of them

Just 5 seconds of Loki????? Aaaaaaaa Marvel, you wanna kill me???

I&#39;m Still Crossing My Fingers for Falcon and Winter Soldier, IT BETTER COME OUT IN 2020, If Delayed to 2021 then Have It in either Jan or March or April 2021!!!

I&#39;m here after WandaVision Trailer
Here after the wandavision trailer drop

Who is here after seeing the new wanda vision trailer? Who is also here when this video popped up in your recommendations when you were watching the new trailer. This is going to be exciting and confusing 

Hopefully we see Magneto in WandaVision

WandaVision is my favourite

Man my boy is the lord of mischief 

Don&#39;t know why but i am excited for Falcon and winter Soldier

Loki&#39;s character is the best

<a href="">0:10</a> I hear badass sound
Man, the Dr. Smith story from Wandavision is crazy good.

There’s only 4 months left of this year when’s the first going to come out

I need a Sam Wilson Captain America movie so bad 
What about Daredevil, Defenders and others that got cancelled on Netflix, please reboot those too, we need those back!!

<a href="">0:10</a>

God on january 1st 2020: <a href="">0:24</a>

Is this on Disney + or Disney + vip

In theory about Loki comebackIf someone thought about the movie (Thor: The Dark World) that Loki pretended he was dead, but they dressed up for the movie (Avengers: Infinity War), then we could say that he pretended to be dead and escaped the explosion like what happened with ThorHe ransomed the theory that he still lives

If the avengers was on endgame but Marvel will rock their fans .Example is this video .

WANDA VISION COMING THIS YEAR!!!!
Marvel better give Loki the attention he needsLike..5 seconds is all he got in this tv spot?

Me repeating the Loki part part: 182828288282
tbh i think there ruining marvel doing all these wee shows

This 30 seconds video I watched it about total of 30 hours

When Falcon is flying, he has his suit from the comics

Anyone else just here for wandavision actually coming in 2020

Fun fact they are reshooting most of the first season of falcon and the winter soldier because the main plot had to do with a virus outbreak. Thats why it hasn&#39;t been released.

7 month old trailer, still no confirmation on the tv shows, Black Widow still taking forever to release, the whole mcu being delayed.

I&#39;m still waiting.

someone: how many times are you gonna watch thisme: i can do this all day

Sure feels like a long &quot;soon&quot;
Loki is awesome

who else got goosebumps?

Journalism: &quot;you need atleast 8 seconds to get your message effectively out&quot;Loki: <b><i>best I can do is 3</i></b>

<a href="">0:11</a> is that the villain from civil war?

<a href="">0:23</a> THAT&#39;S BABY TOMMY AND BILLY OH MY GOD Y&#39;ALL WE FINNA GET THE YOUNG AVENGERS YEESSSSS STAY WINNING
Who’s here after covid

Falcon and the Winter Soldier  &amp;Wandavision &amp;Loki 

who watch in Dolby atmos

Falcon and Winter Soldier ️

Well...coming soon was a lie

<a href="">0:08</a> ARE THOSE GUYS THE NOVA CORPS

LokiGoosebumps ️
We did not get any updates like Dc FANDOME ....so like this hype we want in corona holidays Like me who all wants hit like

That Loki is clearly 2012 Loki cuz he was a good guy until he got ganondorf side-b by thanos and died. Can’t wait for the Loki one specifically

It&#39;s 7 month since upload now release ASAP

Ooohhhh boy looks like we hit the motherload

Welp, still nothing lol

I&#39;m watching this video every day until the series finally come out

Did anyone else notice that Loki was wearing a shirt belonging to the Time Variation Authority? There is a possibility that Kang the conqueror might be one of our next avengers villains folks 

<a href="">0:23</a> oh my god- it&#39;s wiccan and speed!

Keep this in mind. WandaVision could be a potential on House of M

Does anyone else feel it(colour change with beat drop)satisfying <a href="">0:07</a>

Marvel: plan to launch these series in 2020Coronavirus: on your left

I've been looking forward to it for a while, but I don't know when it will be released...
I also don&#39;t know how many times I have watched this 

You&#39;re not a true fan if you&#39;re confused by this. Sorry.

Can&#39;t wait, of course if they&#39;re actually gonna be released

<a href="">0:25</a> : When Your Teacher Tells You You wont pass

I can&#39;t wait to see these shows. 

Dman why this recommended to me? I thought this was a new spot

It's okay to
Is this Mcu

Still waiting

After Chadwick i can even imagine how gonna be this universe

Rip black panther ️️️️️️️
The worship live has started now, grandma
What the hex going on with the WandaVision show it’s so weird because one scene it’s all black and white, the next scene she’s wearing a comic-accurate outfit, and the next is that Vision’s alive some how? Now I want to see the show now.

Speed and Wiccan.That&#39;s my only takeaway.

Just here to remind everybody that the budget for each show is just under 100 million! So expect 8-10 episodes of a full blown marvel movie! Also, if it wasn&#39;t for covid, we would already have Falcon and Winter Soldier smh!!

I guess I  am the only one who watches this 30 seconds video everyday

I am most excited for Falcon and winter soldier .... And of course Loki

Dc gave me a 2 minute trailer for a movie a year away marvel gave me a 30 second teaser in the last 6 months dc knows how to keep us entertained specially when we’re bored during these times I’m kinda pissed

Kuch karo re... comics ke alava

When it&#39;s gonna release?

Loki&#39;s still alive?
This hits different after Corona

just a line from loki was enough

I am here only for 3 seconds of Loki

Is anyone here after the DC fandom

Wanda vision give me an I Love Lucy vide
Lokii 
Hopefully Disney+ comes to my country by the time these shows arrive

Waiting for Loki 
Wow!
DC Releases 4 Trailers to get their Fans Excited.Marvel releases 30 seconds TV spot to get their Fans Excited.LMAO DC.

I am sure you are waiting for the loki trailer  just like me  

Are you the one who commented on this video before now finding your comment just like me , Damm I can do this all day 

Here&#39;s a difference between Marvel trailers and Netflix trailers

some will see it once but not us

WANDAVISION NOW

Only for Loki 

The 3.5K dislikes is from Thanos and his lackeys.

Can you please anounce its releasing date?

LOKI enjoys all day chilling

WELCOME TO LEVEL 7!

Why do I have the feeling that WandaVision it’s gona be super cute and funny but the ending it’s gona be mind blowing and depressing and we will not not what happened until Dr Strange 2??

YouTube : how many times are u going to watch this.          Me: I can do this day

I heard disney+ will probably bring back the gifted I REALLY HOPE THEY DO, IM FREAKING OBSESSED WITH IT!!

Marvel: Guess we are with Disney+A app called “Hotstar”: Oh I Don’t think so But we do take money

Loki steals the entire promo with that one line, he is just the best.

awesome
Hawkeye: Am I a joke to you?

I&#39;m going to need to see Falcon and Winter Soldier as soon as possible.

And it still hasn&#39;t come

when r we gonna get these shows?

Still waiting

man im gonna wait for loki

Wanda were looking so cute

No One:Absolutely No One:Not even Thanos:This trailer: We we’re unable to give Marvel Content, and where did that bring you?... Back To MEEEEEE

Hi

Waiting For Loki
I want this music’s name  please

And The Eternals trailer when???

When the class monitor writes my name on the blackboardLe 8y/o me: <a href="">0:25</a>

6 months later and y&#39;all still havent given any updates smh

When it&#39;s gonna release

Loki is just being LokiI LOVE IT! 

I&#39;m back watching this several months later because I&#39;m so desperate for Marvel content 

Has anyone ever thought of the possibility, that not only are one of the shows called “WandaVision” cause it’s about Wanda and Vision, but because Wanda says “Vision residence” meaning that Vision is her last name? Making her full name “Wanda Vision”

RELEASE THE FULL TRAILER FOR THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER AND WANDAVISION
Are these all tv shows or is falcon and the winter soldier a movie

Swagness levels:Level 1 : Marvel Studios turning from red to blueLevel 2: Bullets falling in front of ZemoLevel 3: Scarlet Witch Comic version costumeLevel 4: Loki!

Loki: I am inevitable
the dislikes are from thanos and his followers

I need them right now

I&#39;m gonna watch this everyday until marvel drops a new trailer. LOL

Remember when this aired in February and everyone went nuts looking forward to it. Then 2020 and COVID 19 had to come and kerb stomp the world. Sigh.

<a href="">0:07</a>Is when It gets good

<a href="">0:24</a>

I&#39;ve watched this so many times and I never get bored. I keep coming back because I crave more marvel, it&#39;s been too long.

Loki

What&#39;s the name of this cool music ? Plss

Daredevil

Loki!!!!!

I came here after supersuper
The Universe is expanding.When will it end?!

And &#39;Coming Soon&#39; now has a bit of a different meaning.

I think WANDA VISION is a prequel to AVENGERS INFINITY WAR because Vision dies in INFINITY WAR Vision&#39;s Death shocked me in the movie theatre because he was nice and kind and then Thanoes kills him (curse you Thanoes) and also Lighting McQueen is my favorite Disney/PIXAR character) I give CARS 1 and 3 a A+ and CARS 2 the worst PIXAR movie gets a F- needs to make a LIGHTING MCQUEEN orgin story movie titted (DISNEY..PIXAR&#39;S MCQUEEN) it Will be about LIGHTING MCQUEEN and how he became a race car, also a CRUZ EMEREZ TV SERIES on DISNEY Plus, and a CARS 4 also CARS and CARS 3 are amazing I do not like the 2nd movie it should have been rated PG because it has violences, deaths, action sequences, Gun shooting, and Explosions (CARS has positive reviews of 75% on rotten tomatoes and also CARS 3 also LIGHTING MCQUEEN should become a AVENGER his supername is SPEED LIGHTING I created another superhero named (Spider Vision) it is Vision with a Spider suit and he has the ability to shoot webs out of his way head and he can fly also

I wonder if the Loki clip was filmed a week before the spot aired, just so that they could make footage for the Loki show.

Wow after watching mandalorian i can tell these series are gonna be as great as mando too!(or greater!)

But when?

The universe is expanding: shows thisBut I still miss home: avengers tower

When is it releasing?

i like this one

Loki in a prison? Or asylum?
Disney: ayo marvel hit me upMarvel: sure why not

After Wandavision you can have Dr. Strange 2 - Multiverse of Madness, then Realities will go crazy, then the powers of the Scarlet Witch will be cool, not only being a &quot;Jean Gray fake&quot; and Dr. Strange not being an Iron Man mystic.

<a href="">0:10</a> Zemo??
Tell me how I only want to watch the Loki show right now

Nice video marvel
It&#39;s funny how Falcon and Winter Soldier had more screen time at this teaser, looked more serious and interesting, and people only talk about Loki and Wanda. <b>WTF</b>

Super bowl : you&#39;ve got 30 secondsMarvel : and that&#39;s enough

Wanda is going crazy and Dr. Strange is the one who has to fix it.

OMAIGAAAAAAAAD

Should&#39;ve got a trailer by now

Anybody know the song used??

I am just here for loki &lt;3

When when I gotta know now 

Still can&#39;t get over the fact that Steve chose Sam as the next Cap instead of Bucky.

Marvel:This universe is expandingMe:Then where&#39;s my mutants are

Me: I can do this all day.

That looks so awesome

Looks like WandaVision may be the only Marvel Studios MCU show to hit Disney Plus this year.

When will it releases in Disney hotstar bro

Every: Comment.Looks: Like this.

I just hope disney won&#39;t turn the marvel movies into some kind of fairy tales kind of stuff.But you know what Loki&#39;s appearance in here is a total badass.

Vision and Wanda are very funny

covid: on your right

Considering that mandolorian was able to make Disney+ one of the biggest streaming services on its own, I can’t wait to see what happens with the shows

Okay but Tom Hiddleston&#39;s voice though  And my man Loki finally about to get the screen time that he deserves

so like how soon

I&#39;m just rewatching this in quarantine and being sad that all the shows are delayed

Please release this series in tamil also,because there are many fans in tamilnadu for marvel

Does anyone know what this song is

Please open Disney+ in Turkey please

Please bring in Raquel Welch 

Beautiful
Every who bought disney plus and waiting for series Corona: lets ruin there lifes

They are releasing the new full fledged 1 minute trailers for each of these Disney + shows

This trailer: releasedDisney+ VIP users : Dang it!

I&#39;ve watching this video many times almost everyday now. Official trailers for these d+ shows wya

I don&#39;t see that in Disney + hotstar I searched but I couldn&#39;t find this

This tv spot, although short was so good. Omg wait until they release six hours of these shows. It going to be so spectacular.

Me on the first day of school: <a href="">0:25</a>

All the dead ones are back in marvel phase 5

The best Couple name Ever WandaVison.

is anyone else more hyped for wandavision more than the other shows?? idk i feel like its gonna be so trippy

AHHH!!!

I edited the comment so it makes no senseWell,nobody cares anyway

Mandoralion season 1 ends.....Marvel -Now its the starting

There’s always those people who didn’t even watch the super bowl and are just finding out <b>oh wait...</b>

I think it’s best trailer ever.

Awsome

I’m over all this, it got annoyed waiting for stuff. I think all the prolonged waiting and covid19 soured me on The MCU. Not exciting anymore.

Omgoooooodddddd

Anyone else here from recommendations 3 months later?

You said soon

CAN DISNEY PLEASE ADD DISNEY+ TO BRAZIL SOONER? I NEED TO WATCH THE CLONE WARS, MANDALORIAN  AND THE NEW ONES

Anyone know the song used for the background?

Nobody:                                                                        CJ in the Mission Burning Denise: <a href="">0:25</a>

Whatever you do or how powerful you are, you still cannot escape the inevitable.

Am I the only one who thinks that at the start it&#39;s Bucky saying it&#39;s time

<a href="">00:24</a>

Oh Seungssubbxeuneungeeugeun
I’m finna be the boomer the actual Loki we know is dead that’s the past Loki that relives the same day over and over but just got ahold to the Tesseract

In my opinion we should get a Ghost Show. I think it’s the perfect way to follow her story.

It’s been 2 months.. I need more WandaVision content

petition for bucky to grow his hair long again ️

All is well and good marvel but how close is “soon”?? I need these now lmao

Azteca 7 Canal 5 Marvel
falcon and winter soldier nice

The series will be in premium only on VIP only

&quot;The Universe is expanding...&quot;Yeah, so is your MONEY, Disney.

Wow

Loki got only 5 seconds but this gives much chills

i could do this all day

Captain America + Falcon= Captain Falcon :O
This was pretty “LOKI” if u know what I mean

Bucky was trying to shoot Helmut Zemo, right?

What does Loki said?

Is Incredible

Anyone want to explain to me what wandavision is about. I’m honestly so confused. It seems like an 80s sitcom for some reason.

BRING BACK DAREDEVIL

Who else is watching this during quarantine?

The Mandolorian: <b>Finishes</b>Disney:: &quot;Send the rest*

okay but like, how the hell did he get that stone

Marvel : The Universe is expanding..Me : &amp; also delaying 

I want spider-man !

In my opinion there&#39;s a lot of theories, why WandaVision could be called that way, without necessarily saying it&#39;s because of &quot;Wanda &amp; Vision&quot;Here are some examples:1.) Pointing to Wanda&#39;s reality which is kind of her vision.2.) Because it&#39;s Wanda&#39;s Vision. Her personal Vision whom she created.3.) Wanda Vision, like, she married him, so henceforth it&#39;s her surname. (&gt;Vision resistance)4.) Wanda is living in a sitcom kind of reality. Therefore she&#39;s in Television. But because it&#39;s her reality/her tv-show, it&#39;s called WandaVision instead of Television.Those are my theories why the show could be named WandaVision without directly pointing out to Vision as the co-protagonist
