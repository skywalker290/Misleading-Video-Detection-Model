Amazing movie

Is young Eddie and older eddie related? Damn

Georgie&#39;s creepy lines are the theme of IT.

Who's here for Jessy's bio from the game Duskwood?‍
<a href="">2:00</a>

Damn good trailer

I miss the original cast

I still watch this trailer sometimes because its just so goddamned well done and epic. Too bad the movie sucked, I remember being hyped AF.

Amo a it
Even pennywise is using the dog filter now 

Chapter 3 pleeaase 
<a href="">2:09</a> music 
<a href="">2:07</a>

 love film
<a href="">1:15</a>

Who else came for Jessy?
Is anyone here from the game duskwood???

They should&#39;ve kept him jumping out sideways like that and homie should&#39;ve met jake

<a href="">2:00</a>

I will never forget how I went nuts when I first saw this trailer

Jessy, what good taste you have (Duskwood)

So you&#39;ve found yourself watching the trailer after 4 years?

Yxudfsydusgudshsuduwdgs
<a href="">2:21</a> IT Chapter 2

they&#39;re hungru :(

people of the comment section, i was told these 2 movies were absolute trash so i didnt have an interest for 5 years, ill tell u something, i hate it when others tell u one thing about a movie but then u finally watch it yourself and it is one of the best franchises i have ever watched, brought me to tears

Old 90s TV movie one was better despite being so cheesey. Dialogue ruined this one. Millennial writers 100%

I love this movie so much.

It: Chapter Two continues brings the Losers Club back to Derry, Maine to reunite and defeat Pennywise for good. It’s pretty frightening at times, emotional with it’s music and scenes, and gives me a good feeling once it’s over.

This is probably the best adult casting I’ve seen in any movie and most of the lines got me goosebumps, especially “YOU LIED AND I DIED!!!”.

This movie is better then the first one

Released

I didn&#39;t know you where into scary stuff, Jessy.

This movie so fire 20/10

I only saw It a year ago and at the end I was wondering what happens if Pennywise comes back? I guess now I’ll be able to find out. Once my heart stops thumping in my throat. Anyone know if that’s normal?

Probably one of the best trailers out there.

Movies sucked...the old one was much better

Where... is he?

Can I pick a piece of your hairs?

<a href="">0:53</a> Nah bro it’s Trevor from gta 5

There were so many plotholes in this film!! Can anyone answer these cause it&#39;s driving me nuts!1) Surely the group would have stayed together for a few more years in Derry before they became old enough to move away? But yet they keep saying it&#39;s been 27 years since they saw each other and all their memories together are as them at 13. Surely they&#39;d still know each other at 182) It&#39;s stated in the first movie that IT couldn&#39;t kill Bev because she wasn&#39;t afraid. Well the little girl Vicky wasn&#39;t afraid (she actually looked excited) and yet IT bit her head off. So does it feed on fear or not? 3) Beverly smacked her dad over the head so hard that he would have been hospitalised. Yet she doesn&#39;t get arrested for attempted murder?4) IT is strong enough to create terrifying hallucinations and get them all to see the same thing at once but he isn’t strong enough to kill them? He had to get Henry to go after them for him. It was laughable5) There are at least 2 missing children by the time they kill IT. The town would be crawling with police, fbi and searches. Yet they all jump into a lake in complete isolation when the police would be all over it. 6) How did Stanley or his wife get all of their addresses so fast and at the same time? It was like 48 hours. I know it&#39;s a movie but the realism is stupid. However, the scene where Ritchie throws a rock at ITs face and angers it into petrifying him was awesome  best scene of the two movies.

Alright lemme watch IT Chapter 2 again 

I&#39;m from Jessy&#39;s link

This is not Ronald McDonald this is pennywise the dancing clown

I wish there was a movie called it vs five nights at Freddy&#39;s pennywise vs Freddy Fazbear

As a massive king fan and as a massive fan of this book, I was quite disappointed. Andy’s direction was nothing like the one of chapter 1, it felt exaggerated, over the top, Bowers was kind of wasted in this movie. The tongue twister that billy was reciting in the first movie led to nothing in this one. Eddie and the leper man was also terrible, that scene where he vomits on him. Would’ve been a nice call back but the tone was all over the place and the music choice made it more funny than scary. Happy Mike got more the screen time tho, also was cool finding the Christine and the shining references (and Stephen king’s cameo) overall, it wrapped up well but leaves you empty, not the same emptiness that the book leaves in you (which is nostalgic and sad) but empty in the way you wish it had played out differently and smarter directing decisions were made. I watched this the day it came out, I only came to terms with it until now 4 years later lol. I will still rewatch this trailer in hope that we get another remake of IT in my lifetime.

This trailer was better then the movie imo. I mean it was pretty ok. But the power of friendship was a little weak

Hey. Arnold

Stenli

Yeah no I don&#39;t think I have anything I&#39;m actually &#39;scared&#39; of .* Deluge dirge starts playing *<b>AAAAAAAAA</b>

&quot;you lied... and i died&quot;  this sentence will always give me chills

I watched the first one and it was really impressive to watch due to all the effects of it and the remake wasn’t that scary but disturbing. I gotta say, pennywise the clown reminds me of Ryuk from Death Note

i love this movie was a warm day in perris when i saw this with my friend gen we were in the thiters all alone cause movie was creepy and it was a cheep movie place but fun when i was eating popcorn and watch it all the way i really kinda fealt like it was in the house maybe it was hunted theter i do kinda bealive in ghosts but this movie we watched all the way and we injoyed each and every moment now that i look i cry sometimes cause i missed her she no longer in my heart she left me and sad how life is one day its hot and cold but i love it this is a great movie people watch its scary and injoyable

This movie was pretty bad and a total cringe-fest

Omoo this movie get better hyping, a great job is done here

It can this great movie looks so seminar to children in the first movie?

<a href="">1:30</a>-<a href="">1:47</a>

&quot;Hello Fat Boy !&quot;
<a href="">2:08</a> I like this Trailer Sounds

Best movie

Hey, wasn&#39;t this movie 2 hours and 50 minutes long?

This film is great up until the final act which is not very good in true King fashion and I really had high expectations for it after part 1

Yo estando aquí por jessy de duskwood me being here for jessy from duskwood
This movie is so good.

damn boring movie
Still waiting for chapter 3 love it

That kid in the yellow coat needs in oscar

&quot;For 27 years... I dreamt of you... I craved you... I missed you..!&quot;The exact thing I&#39;m going to say to a Big Mac when 27 years passes. 

SPOOKY CLOWNS SCARE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111

Kids today will never understand the hype for this movie.

I watched this movie in theaters. And it terrified me.

no bad cgi 
Who came from Jesse from Dusk wood?
Where can I watch the second part?

VIM PELA Jessy

What a disappointment, great cast but ruined by all that stupid cgi clips.

At first i wanted to watch it to see James McAvoy but then i really enjoy the movie

Does anybody know where I can get James McAvoy checkered shirt from

They all float down here

Ronald McDonald isn’t doing so well after he got fired

This is still one of the greatest trailers of all time

What a disaster

Kind of weird how to see Bill Hader do a horror movie

This trailer is so good

<a href="">2:20</a> I didn’t know ishowspeed was in the movie

So, how stupid can you be as a movie producer to not cast a Beautiful Red Haired with Amazing eyes like the original ?  Beyond Stupid.

IT Chapter Two came out during my junior year of high school. This movie is awesome even though it&#39;s scary and sad.

Too much CGI... Garbage.

When the trailer is 10 times better than the movie.Such a shame thr first one was really good this one sucked hard

They’d be stupid not to do a Part III. Even if it’s a prequel, Bill Skarsgard is perfect for this role.

<a href="">1:17</a> Thirst trap makers be like

thanks duskwood
LOST CHARACTER

IT isn’t even scary it’s just sad.

3 years later &amp; I get 2019 vibes all over again

I was brought here by a game

Is there being a it 3???

why is the trailer so good lol?

The walking dead By the Best of Thrones

Wow, the video of the thing was really cool
I came for Jessy
I came for jessy
This ain&#39;t horror, this is action.

The amount of hype for this movie was unexplainable. I watched this in the theater with my dad and it was real disappointing, but I still ADORE Bill Hader and just the whole trailer

that one scene with Ediie and Richie at the end made me cry so bad

Hahaha how they put everyone's version of the past, but it was obvious who Beberly and Mike were xD
Turkish dubbing?
I&#39;ve just came from Jessy profile from game Duskwood

This movie is so scary lol

Who else is here for Jessy from Duskwood?

Who else feels like this trailer is underrated only having 40M Views

Pls give McNuggets

I’m lovin IT ~Pennywise ( Co founder of McDonald’s) Ronald McDonald’s little brother 

Jessy sent me here
<a href="">1:28</a>

Probably one of the best trailers ever made

Release on sep 6 thats my birthday!

That final clip tho: <a href="">2:17</a>

I miss 2017 and 2019 :,)

IT CHAPTER THREE WHEN??

It only came back because of that blood pact they did at the end of Chapter one

Good taste Jessy
Anyone know where to find this sound effect? <a href="">2:08</a>

O

I only came for Jessy
I might be in the minority but I was pretty disappointed they turned It Chapter 2 into a horror-comedy.  And that kinda also applies to Chapter 1.

I really do scary horror movies

Where can I watch it?

Goofy ah ah  broke mirror
Jessy wtf?

A Nice movie ️
First part of this Movie is better than this one

To this very day, this trailer still gives me goosebumps.

The two small clips of Richie reacting to Eddie’s death: barley discernibleMe: KJHDACIJHSACIUBSAFIJBAEDIJAnguish pain whyy howww darrreeee

I love the underlying tone which shows up in the movie which is that Bill isn&#39;t scared of Pennywise and he remembers that from when he was younger. He&#39;s just angry at him so Pennywise uses that against him when he&#39;s older. Hence showing him his brother screaming those lines (guilt tripping) and using the boy as bait so Bill can rage out. We all heard what Master Yoda said about fear and anger

The trailer is kind of weird and cool at the same time

Duskwood

L
Got to give praise to the cast and crew for staying as true to the novel as they did given the script. While I love Chapter 1 the best, I was nonetheless amazed and pleased how the sequel was true to King&#39;s work in notable respects. The adult Losers cast did and amazing job and Bill Skarsgard&#39;s performance as Pennywise was incredible!

IM SCARED NICE SCARY VIDS

anyone else here from Jessys link from duskwood?

Am I the only one who ended up here through Jessy from Doskwood's profile?
Thanks Jessy. <a href="">#Duskwood</a>

He&#39;s looks like the movie the joker . DC The Joker the supervillain.

I hate what they did with Stanley. They should have just kept him there. It felt so incomplete without him.

(<a href="">1:59</a>)

I love <a href="">0:30</a> it gives me the good vibes like slay

Workneh Cashier

Awesome video!

Enjoyed it!

I&#39;m so glad I found and watched that video! The casting for this movie was so perfect I can&#39;t even tell who&#39;s acting and who&#39;s just being themselves.  I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty  Travels  Premium.

When Ronald McDonald sees someone eating KFC...

I came here again for Jessy, but at the time I was super excited about the it 2 trailer 

Anyone else coming from Duskwood?

I really love Pennywises monologue in this trailer. Even if it&#39;s just four lines.

<a href="">1:15</a> laugh is epic

<a href="">1:13</a> SVTFOE

drive careful
jessy likes it
jessy brought me here

Jessy likes It the thing 
feel movies
Imagine how much more hyped this movie would&#39;ve been had they actually waited 27 years

im sorry but <a href="">1:19</a>

Even though i liked the movie, i thought it had the same problem that pirates of the Carribbean 3 did, it was way longer than it should be, but unlike that movie, it two has great pay-offs with emotional moments that hurt, and i think it&#39;s underated!

They are missing one kid tho

Witness the end of it 9.6.19 in IMAX &amp; dolby cinema

Thank you jessy 
tbh I miss the hype for this movie

Is this McDonald&#39;s official movie? 

Wait, it&#39;s been 2 years already? Dang

God, this movie is boring. The original is so much better.

Jessy

Oh Jessie rights this is really scary

I figured Jessy gave off a vibe from this movie

I hate, hate, haaateee that the movie didn&#39;t live up to my expectations and let&#39;s face it. Was the worst it could be. Such a dissapointment.

Am I the only one from Jessie&#39;s link?

Why does Jessy just have this in her links-

Who else is here from the game DuskWood 

DUSKWOOD?

(Spoiler) Even if Stan didn’t survive I feel like they should’ve added him like how they did with the rest of the losers when it showed them when they were 12 and now

Hey boy, where are the Brazilians here?
Jessy really liked the trailer.

IT in South Centfal Compton projects  Chapter 3 

Jessy

Thanks for the recommendation, Jessy. Hahaha

I think jessy likes it movie

This movie traumatized my whole childhood 

Jessie brought me
I remember when this movie came out lol

I want to be friends with Beggerly

It’s called IMAGINATION PLUS COCAIN

Woow!

So good.. 
For such a dope trailer, the sequel was such a letdown.  It just didn&#39;t have the horror/mystery and suspense as much as the first one did since it&#39;s from the perspective of their younger selves

ok Jessy

we want chap3 and there bill should marry bevv

I'm watching JESSY
<a href="">2:13</a> when he jumps out the vent I don’t remember this scene what part of the film was it?

I come from the lok game
I can&#39;t believe this was 2 years ago

Whoever knows gravity falls this looks like a gravity falls trailer

Sadly we will never get a horror movie like this again, so let&#39;s admire the great times we had repeating this film over and over again

This was truly one of the best trailers i have ever seen. It still gives me chills. Such a shame the movie was so bad.

Gotta say, Beverly developed a damn good butt chin for the past 27 years, lol

It&#39;s a pity the movie didnt have the trailer quality :(

Great freaking movie
And I came here because of the game
Am I the only one who just likes the trailer music

Any one else from duskwood 

The children from the 2017 movie, should play the next IT Movie in the future.

This movie release on my birthday

Duskwood and Sweet Jessy brought me here

For some reason I always come back to watch this trailer, there&#39;s just something about it.

<b>This is how you should make a trailer</b> 

<b>The best movie</b> 

damn I&#39;m so looking forward to it!

Still giving Thrills

Eita bbs Jessy fã de it
This is been 2 years since the movie is released but still this is rememberable horror movie <a href="">#myopinion</a>

The &quot;For 27 years, I dreamt of you, I craved you, I missed you!&quot; Scene gave me legit goosebumps. I loved all 3 movies

Chapter 3  please ????

SYETE TRESE

It would be more fun if stan and eds didn&#39;t died

It would be more fun if stan and eds didn&#39;t died

In 24 years we all gonna be watching another it movie

Spoiler if you haven’t read the book or seen this movie yet….I know Stan dies and he&#39;s barley in the movie, but I think it&#39;s just disrespectful for him to not include his adult counterpart in the trailer. We see the transition of what the Losers look like from kids to adults at <a href="">0:43</a>-<a href="">0:54</a>, but Stan isn&#39;t included. The fact that they don&#39;t show adult Stan in this trailer kinda gives it away to the audience who&#39;s never read the book or seen the miniseries that he wouldn&#39;t really be in the movie very much. While adult Stan is barley in the movie, there was still enough footage to show his face during that sequence I mentioned in the timestamp above.

Idk y but there was a link in the game duskwood which brought me here...

Both parts are funny but not scarry at all not like the trailers 

<a href="">2:02</a>

<a href="">2:01</a> You lied, and I died. YOU LIED, AND I DIED!

Ok I suspect Jessie
A

Jeez Jessy... Don&#39;t u think it&#39;s a little close to home? (Darkwood)

doesnt matter how the movie is, but this trailer still give me a terrible shock.

I DON&#39;T LIKE THIS MOVIE

BeforDo you forget that?

I can&#39;t believe they left out the part when Pennywise captures Bill&#39;s wife.

I was so disappointed with this movie.

It super movies

My crantri Sri Lanka

Wow Sri Lanka

I came here because of the Duskwood game hahahahaha
Jessy has great taste I would say
I don&#39;t why it converts my depression to psychoticness !

Actually wanna ask if I am the only one who noticed how ripped Ben Ben has become after 27 years.. like so perfectly sculpted 

Jessy ‍️
Jessy has great taste in movies!
I came for Jessy
A piece of garbage! Not worth watching 

Why do I love pennywise I don&#39;t know lol.. Maybe there&#39;s monster inside me

I was playing duskwood, and a character had mentioned this movie name on her profile

TIME TO FLOAT 

I love derry
He make me freak out

ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Value investment proposition?

RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Value investment proposition?

I came for Jessy
Now THIS is how a trailer should be made

2017 IT2019 IT CHAPTER TWO

I love the music in the trailer.

Right when it said witness I got major chills

God Bless the Man who cuts this trailer.. WOW

Hello film maker I want to tell something ok now sir when will come to YouTube IT2 the pennywise pls send in u tube pls

its gonna be agreat movie  i love pennywise all movies with clowni love them

I am waiting it to download faster for watching it is going scare my aunt 

After first 3 minutes I switched to another movie.For  real! 

Any fellow duskwooders??
I watched this movie it&#39;s amazing

Anyone know the song during the end of the trailer?

USA kids, if you are afraid of such nonsense.
I love this movie how about you

Did you come because of duskwood too? :D
Scared to watch it... Still watches it anyway

Going to because he&#39;s a big you can it would and what did the did the did the did you know anymore__)-

Pennywise Why do I dream about you ?!

Oh dude look is pennywise

Who

Oh my gosh who is that

Oh is boy is kill and it

the best bit about the movie was Isaiah Mustafa&#39;s voice and the Pennywise scenes.

3 hours of trash. did all those actors sign for a better script or just some dollar dollar?

Jessy tf

Uh ohh looks like our old freind is bigger and better

Friend if you are here for duskwood thank you
That's what Jessy likes (duskwood)
So to beat Pennywise you have to say &quot; Im NoT aFrAiD &quot; even tho they are? What a joke of a ending....

2 years later and I still can’t get over the casting is phenomenal

Of course its a comedy, don&#39;t you hear...the laughing ?

tbh this kind of scary movie will haunt me in my lifetime if i were a kids watching this. always have bad dream of this kind of clown, scare. just briliant.

Nice and cool 

Its official IT has stop and seized to be a creepy clown movie. Its now just a compilation of ideas  from other movies botched to make this movie. Somewhere Stephen King is probably crying his heart out bcuz some egghead ruined his legacy.

Gi

Hi

Trailer was far better than the movie. Because, it was not scary but disgusting at some point.

I liked the original one. The first remake was ok, but this one is more disgusting than it is scary

The monsters in this movie werent scary, they were disgusting

I'm here because Duskwood 
Who came here because of Jessy from the game?
wow this trailer is one of my favorite damn It the best movie i think ever came out for kids does who love horror

this is better than the made for tv movie and one of the very best scary movies in a long time

What Jessica chastain movie is it referring in this?

There’s gotta be a third one like no way that was the end making him a shrivelled up baby with no heart

My only issue with Chapter 2 is that I would have made Beverly completely fearless and savage. She deserved to be the real hero in this movie as she had so much abuse her whole life. In the first movie she was the strongest.

Who remembers when this came out

John Harkey

Georgie looks too sweet to be that monster

Can’t only the kids see him??

Wow, 45mins in and it&#39;s just bad. The Hockstetter ghoul, the clown, the cgi.

MANO SE LIGA HEIN JESSY

I didn't know Jessy liked it
Jessy and her peculiar cat
I love Skarsgard’s delivery of “kiss me, fat boy”, Tim Curry’s can never be beat, but damn it was good.

Only Brazilians will be able to enjoy it ️This comment

the perfect trailer

Anyone here who loved the 90a version because original has it&#39;s own vibe

Had no idea that jessica chastain was in here

Bill Hader was unaware that Bill Skarsgård can actually move his eyes in two different directions. Hader asked Skarsgård what kind of editing was done to achieve the effect in the first movie. Skarsgård, in full costume and makeup, responded by saying &quot;Oh, you mean this?&quot; and doing it, causing Hader to freak out.

Man I wish there was a part 3.

if there will be the creeper vs pennywise that will be awesome

This movie came out on my birthday...sooo, I saw it for celebration..

One of the best sequels of all time in my opinion.

Duskwood...

The clip at <a href="">2:17</a> is just brilliant.

Honestly I haven&#39;t even watched the first IT cause it seems kinda scary cam someone pls tell me if it&#39;s actually really scary?

I’m confused I watched it chapter two and didn’t see what’s in the trailer 

IT would’ve been better if both Chapters 1&amp;2 were in Real D 3D and IMAX 3D.

The trailer was nice but movie was too dumb 

Mannnnnnnnnnnnn I&#39;m not even gonna lie. This trailer had me scared asf

Nice...)

Can someone pls do everybody a favor and use this trailer as rebuttal to ppl saying trump 2024 and like make It, Trump. I would do it myself but like don’t have skill or talent or energy

Pennywise is really coming back so you better live to play another day because Pennywise is about to attack

This movie was horrible.

What is the laugh sound effect at <a href="">1:00</a> ? I&#39;ve been trying to look it up

I was watching this last nigth on HBO. Finality this is better than It 1

The ending sucked.

Right at the beginning, huh?!
This is not so scary

i will never get over how hurt richie looks <a href="">2:11</a> <a href="">2:15</a>

i cant even express how much i wish i saw this in theatres

Pennywise would not survive a Modern Warfare 2 Lobby

This is scary

this is so scary that even Gordan Ramsey would get scared

came here from the game duskwood

Happy endings are a blessing in horror movies...I loved the ending so much...Any recommendations on horror movies with happy endings??

Tbh this movie isn&#39;t scary. Too much creature and special effects. It was good but it just seemed more of a fantasy movie then a scary horror movie.Same with the first movie although that was actually built like a horror movie and was a teeny bit scarier

eminem lose yourself
So did anyone actually like it chapter 2 more than the first one?

Too bad the movie was str8 trash..

I love the movie because• zero jumpscares• powerful story line• InterestingWhat&#39;s your favorite horror movie 

<a href="">2:16</a> I just come here everyday to hear this

This movie wasn&#39;t scary <b>at all</b> but it was pretty enjoyable tbh. I genuinely liked it.

Some of the parts of the trailer is not in the movie

IT gone forever. The children defeated the clown. But only Stephen King can create a continuation of the story. Either back to the beginning, or ... It doesn&#39;t matter, haha ​​ha haha  ha  aaaaaaaaaaaaa!

I love it  chapter 2

This is the scariest trailer I have ever watched

<a href="">2:05</a> Covid victims after trump admitted downplaying the virus in the beginning

Anyone else think pennywise sounds like scooby doo?

<a href="">2:08</a> is the best part of the trailer since the music is so dramatic

Hey guys I know it&#39;s stupid but can I watch this movie without watching IT ??

The best line from pennywise <a href="">1:30</a>

<a href="">1:28</a> is where a ad should play if you know what I mean.

They should make IT chapter 3

To me it is not scary at all

Terrible movie.  Felt like it was directed and written by 12 year olds.

corridor digital
boys and girls. this is a REAL gud trailer

I am not gonna watch dis im gonna have nightmares whem i sleep i always have nightmares when i sleep so that&#39;s why im not watching dis i already seen it but not the chapter 2 tho-

one of the most disturbing and shocking parts of the movie was actually the beginning with the killing of adrian, which is based on a real happening; just except for the alienpart of course. but it really happened that some youngsters threw a homosexual man off the bridge who had asthma and drowned afterwards. his name was Charlie Howard

I wish the movie was as good as the trailer made it out to be

you lied and I died

endgame trailer

How to ruin a movie opening: GAY GAY GAY GAY GAYYYY

This Story was based on a Real Clown who was killing and rapeing Children in Chicago for 10 years

This give me chilssss

Its really sad that we didn&#39;t see Mike meets Pennywise againYes i mean this scene <a href="">2:14</a>

This trailer is really good but the movie 

congratulations pewdiepie
Oh no...There making a IT chapter 3 Without Billskarsguard! I have to admit Billskarsguard is the best pennywise. Also i legit commented under a billskarsguard interview to ask if they can make a IT chapter 3 where when richie dies they will get a chance to go back and warn there friends, Then again that wouldnt be that bloody. Comment down below what u think.

I don&#39;t know why my mind keeps saying &quot;Beverage&quot; instead of &quot;Beverly&quot; LOL 

wow (:/

Still one of the most hype trailers I&#39;ve ever seen!

Warner Bros All movies Are Great Specially This Movie

Pennywise VS Joker !!!

Greatest 2 movies to watch back to back

I miss the feeling for this

It Chapter Two was a good film but this trailer made it looked to be a great film.

The creeping music gets me every time lol

Penny wise has a bad sense of humour

When the trailer is more awesome and exciting than the movie

Best movie forever
yelawolf

Totally goin on my resume 
Just watched it. Not scary at all and also very  boring. Maybe a littlebit funny but If you want to lough just go and watch a comedy movie. It did NOT worth the 3 hours of watching at all.

I watched it in 2019 and I did not go to cinema

Too much story for a rushed 2 movie franchise. If it was a limited series they wouldn’t rely on  cheap jump scares. Going deeper in the story of Pennywise would have been way scarier.

<a href="">2:00</a>

<a href="">

<a href="">1:22</a> dammit professor! use your powers.

Still worth it! I went to see it even with all the epilepsy warnings everyone had shown and even said to me. I was like f- you. I&#39;m going to watch this epic movie on the big screen no matter what and- YES. It was SUPER AWESOME!!!

he do be lookin kinda fresh doe

I&#39;ve seen all the it&#39;s the original and both the remake and this one and they are all good

hey anyone&#39;s please tag me a great horror film ️

pikasprey
Wow... this movie is just embarrassing. and to think i was actually looking forward to it and believed it would actually hold up. it gets rid of the subtle scare style of the first one that builds up and treats the viewer like actual adult viewers and replaces it with cheap CG jump scares that turn every scene into a laughing stock that only a 4 year old would be afraid of.

Movie was a mess. All the running around, lost its own plot. The book ending was more heroic, like Chapter 1. You end up with a generic monster movie, with references to other movies to make it more jazz hands.

The movie:  <b>pennywise rises from 27 years</b>The losers: umm well u think ur so strong umm well, u small!!!Pennywise: <b>dramatically falls and turns to a baby clown</b>The losers: well he&#39;s dramatic.. .. NOW LETS PARTY!!

Someone else is seeing this after the movie or is just me?

YALL THIS IS JUST THE TRAILER IMAGINE THE MOVIE

Love it
As far as horror movie trailers go this is just fantastic whether you liked the actual movie or not. IT Chapter 2 get&#39;s allot of shit for it&#39;s pacing and sometimes out of place humor but I would argue it&#39;s still fairly enjoyable especially if you binge watch both movies back to back.

too top
run the jewels

2020?

This is not scary at all but I found it a good funny Film

I don&#39;t know how people can complain about this movie... I reckon it was great!

Thought the first movie was a great remake from the first one. Chapter two was okay. Stephen King is a good writer

This technically happens in 2016.

This trailer...This Movie 

It’d a no from me 

<a href="">2:14</a> that part never happened in the movie right or is just me¿?

I don’t see why people hated this so much it wasn’t as good as the first but I still enjoyed it

The trailer made the movie seem like it was gonna be one of the best horror movie sequels of all time

IT

This gave me nightmares im bloody 35!

penny: time to float!me: let me ask my mom...penny: it&#39;s-its not a choice- me. <b>she said no.</b>

Check out pennywise&#39;s drawing:<a href=""> check it out,  Youtube keeps deleting yhe views on this video

If they hadn’t done the weird cgi on the kids’ faces, this would have been a better movie. That cgi just took me out of every flashback scene.

All I can say about this movie is CGI is the next best thing to slice bread. If you wanna make a horror movie try making one up and stop  Ruining the classics!!

I live this movie so much!!!

This is why you don’t go to a Carnival and inside a house THAT LITTERELY HAS THE LABEL FUNHOUS

This looks amazing

I love the little guitar thing that plays

Damn this movie is as good as the book, even with some details differnet

It sounds like Scooby-Doo

Stephen King knows how to make us all depressed little shits

Most overrated film ever

Awesome trailer

Atho

I&#39;m here from Duskwood.

The trailer was better than  movie

Yes the first chapter is definitely better than the second chapter but chapter 2 is still good imo.

<a href="">2:06</a>

<a href="">1:18</a>

I watched this sad that the boy died with the broken arm :c

Hi

Woah what is that noise it&#39;s sounds epic(<a href="">2:07</a>)

What’s the name of the track they used for this?

<a href="">2:18</a> when you try to scare your friends pretending to be penny wise but your makeup falls off because ur sweating so much.

Am I the only one who came back here because of a disappearing game?;-----;
But it says IT comes every 100 years

SO I will say trailer is amazing but the movie was not even scary. Not a lot of death in it as I thought but I still prefer the first one

Gives me chills

Damn, this trailer is freaking epic.

here because of Jessy Hawkins

Maybe Eddie will be The Next pennywise in Chapter 3 o.O

The movie was good but the trailer was even more epic

That’s be so creepy to be stuck in the hall of mirrors with that thing

I going to tell my kids that pennywise is Ronald McDonald so that they would stop bying McDonald food hehe

Billy was more  handsome when he was a kid I like him

Wanne shit movie this
Unpopular opinion, I preferred this to the first one.

How do they look like their childhood size

Just watched this. Absolute garbage.  Way too long, stupid and boring.

This was worse than the first one so all you have to do is insult him and  his ugly ass would turn  little , this is the worst almost 3-hour movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life... Pennywise is basically a pedophile something Steven king knows a lot about That&#39;s why you see it in his movies and all these kids grew up successful lives and they go back cuz they promised to go back if appeared again he should have gave the money he paid to make this bullshit  to me, whoever went to the movies spent money to see this is a pedophile this movie was bullshit I don&#39;t even know why I watched it cuz I hated the first one also, . .. I almost cut this movie off it was so trash if you like this movie you are a pedophile also only pedophiles like these type of movies... 4/10 for me... Anyway I thought Stephen King was dead his ugly ass still alive... I didn&#39;t even know he made the movie until I seen him in it ugly azz shit...

This part sucks

Chapter 3 prequel

the last time i felt actual happiness is when this trailer released

This film was&#39;nt the slightest bit scary.I still liked it though.

I can’t stop watching this trailer 

Gorgie:you lied and I died me: and I craped

this movie was so bad

One year ago

panny wise creepy i love this move i think this was one of my favorite movies ever i never knew it could be that good i was shoked in teaters and generaly they made a good movie

I used to watch this on repeat before the movie came out

Movie was so depressing I have to self isolate for 10 years.  

it’s been a year :(

One year ago 

Pennywise the pedophile

just thinking about how crazy it is that this trailer came out a year ago today...crazy.

I cant be the only one who thinks this is a shit ending

That scene in <a href="">2:14</a> is not in the movie, and I don’t know why.

I know I am late, but I am wondering...This whole 27 years of his disappearance after the teens (now adults) thought they had finished him,that Penny wise has been spending his life savings on Balloons? in the past 27 years (movietime)?Lol

So like, is it worth watching?

Why does Georgie looks like FaZe h1sky

Pennywise is basically trolling them but in a really terrifying way

Man was this film dissapointing smh

Pennywise: I m back!Zachary smith: Oh Bitch Not the fuck you again Oh No!(He made video about if I was in it movie 1)

This trailer is a million times better than this movie

I just can&#39;t believe that pennywise is back

uhh yea im never watching this

For some reason I think that the movie is not as scary as the trailer 

I watched this with my parents last night Im fricken creeped out....

My god this movie was terrible. When will movie makers realise cgi just isn&#39;t scary.

Actually Prefer Chapter 2 

Quite possibly the worst film i&#39;ve ever seem, an absolute pile of cow dung

Bryce Howard looks too old. she looks younger than the adult Ben. lol.

Wowwwwwwwww 
Bad movie

anyone for Duskwood?
Fantastic movie

Super Trailing Direction
me watching in 2020 for fun

I remember being so hyped for this movie

Thanks for 1k likes

Who came from Duskwood?

These Macdonald’s Commercials are getting out of hand.

<b>I remember waiting for this for months and going to see it with my best friend.  Great times before the pandemic</b> 

Pennywise vs COVID 19 I rather die of Pennywise

Below expectation 

I watched It and it was amazing.

It: flies with balloons Kid: Look it’s Mary Poppins

i just want to be as happy as i was when this trailer dropped

WHAT DOES IT WANT!?

No matter what this movie should be a series for some reason

Save georgie bill SAVE him

I just realized that there are two scenes in this trailer that weren&#39;t in the movie... 

will this be the last IT

I used to be scared of It but am not afraid anymore it little scary

Just got around to watching Chapter 2.Took me so long because I was so disappointed in part one.Have to say Chapter 2 was no better than the 1st.Bill Skarsgard&#39;s portrayal  as Pennywise was just plain awful.Tim Curry was much better.Waste of time and a major let down.After watching this I re watched the original,much better than this piece of crap.

the it movies are so good bc they are equally funny and scary

SELAM YIKIK 2020 YKS TAYFA

The trailer was better than the movie, also please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who jams tf out to the last 30 seconds of the trailer?

It trailer was scarier

<i>_YEEST_</i>

Me trying to laugh so I don’t get scared ............. nope I’m still scared 

florida georgia line
Awesome movie for me.

It pains me that the second was so utterly botched. Missing detail all over the place, tonal fucking mess, terrible ending imagining of the spider / ritual.

<a href="">2:12</a>

We can’t let it happen again.2 years laterIT CHAPTER 3 OUT NOW

Pennywise tried to pull me

Who else came because of DusckWood?
The final scene in this trailer is scary!!!Pennywise - &quot;Wohhh ohh&quot;

I can’t with these comments-

It&#39;s a shame that a dope trailer like this hyped me up for such a shit movie.

Just watched the second film for a third time. It really is about the adults coming to terms with their demons. And somewhere in there is an evil clown playing tricks. If you want the scares and the horror, rely on Chapter 1. If you want closure and a life affirming message, turn to Chapter 2. In my opinion, each film perfectly captured their respective parts of the book. Job Well Done.

We need a part 3 

MAN I wish the movie had delivered on this trailer.

Its two different acters for the losers club

At least it isn’t as scary as the cat movie trailer

Well Spoiler Folks:Trashmouth is still Trashmouth

<a href="">1:46</a> insert Monokuma laughter

this movie gave me depression

Another great adaptation, but again, they just can&#39;t seem to get that final kill scene right in my opinion.

As a horror movie it failed but as a fantasy-drama it’s amazing. Also a an amazing adaption of the second half of the book

I just realized that stanley isnt here i- its only his hand in blood-

I came across the video through duskwood crime thriller and detective investigative games     IS HERE HANNAH?!

Long Before X-Men, there was the loser club

Georgie:you lied i died Me:ummmm your crazy like you talking to a clown thats not me idc if i said i was sick like boyyy you died still

Actually I liked It chap 1 as the kids were so cute  and one like for bill

YOU LIED AND I DIED

Me in front of grandma: &quot;I CUSSED AND I DIED&quot;

No one:Girls on snapchat: <a href="">1:19</a>

Im actually pissed that they let me down. In trailer Beverly and Bill seem together, they have a kiss , but then in the end of movie this bitch ben show up and I feel sad. Sorry for Benverly shippers but that is how I feel. team Bilverly

Kids nowadays:O K B O O M E R
Hannah,  where are you?

Not scary

<a href="">2:00</a> the hurt in Georgie&#39;s voice hurts me

poor Bill Scarsgard,he has nightmares of him and IT,imagine being dead in that dream with IT

Real friendship and scary and sadness ossom movie My favorite character bill

When is the it super cut coming

You gotta give it to him he tries to find his kud eventhough theres a clown tryna kill him

the worst movie ever!

Wait i thought i wasnt watching the scariest movie trailer

You lied and I died

1st chapter was awesome if we compare  to second part ... I literally got bored watching second part . Just a wastage of time and internet data .

The ending is what happens when u find clown paint  and want to terrify ur sister

I came here through a game and didn't understand anything but that's okay, this movie looks great.
Another clown movie. Human race is retarded.

Did anyone ever realizes that in this movie shows Ben’s flashback of being attacked by Pennywise at school. But Ben finds out about Pennywise on the last day of school in the first movie.

it is the best movie of ghost
