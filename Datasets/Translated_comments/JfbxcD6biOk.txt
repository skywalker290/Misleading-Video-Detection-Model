Today, after five years, Bollywood has zeroed in on such movies.

2008 was the year when heath ledger shifted some of His files into Rahul as he was being forced out 

This story should take forward , Zoya Akhtar should work on the script for its return.

Very nice movie

Today it&#39;s been exact 3 years to this movie,  I wish I could go back in time and relive all those years again having my present consciousness 

This movie raised the rap culture in India

What a performance Ranveer Singh Vijy razz

Revolutionary movie

Chichhore was never ever better than this movie !!! even if the fact that sushant died or you guys like him its still isn‚Äôt 

Shame again!!! Copied 4m 8mile

Nyc

I loved it, but India has a long way to go in terms of rap, hip hop and RnB.

Gully boy

Masterpiece .....Bina dekhe people start HATE speech...

Thanks to that crazed woman people feel it is ok to shit on this masterpiece. Calling it a rip off of 8 Mile is just pathetic as it is based on the real-life stories of two underground rappers based in Mumbai. This movie will continue to age well due to the sheer amount of talent (the rappers) who worked on this while that psychopath will fade into obscurity.

I remember when some morons started to lambast this movie in favor of Chhichore and questioned the relevancy of Ranveer Singh&#39;s getting honorary accolade for his role and performance in Gully Boy. For me, this movie was far and far better than all of its contemporary movies released in 2019. Yes, SSR did a good job in Chhichhore, but you can&#39;t base your premise by using Chhichhore to criticize Gully Boy calling it a trash movie. That&#39;s why I say, only biased and stupid people will call this movie trash. For me, it was one of the best movies, not because of the raving performance of the cast but due to portraying a good cinematic message of &quot;when the going gets tough, the tough get going.&quot; And lastly, Zoya is definitely India&#39;s one of the brightest minds who know how to direct a movie with great cinematic values.

Maturity is when you realise that the guy in first battle was kr$na.

Starting line is voice of krsna Ô∏è

The fact that this trailer starts with KR$NA&#39;s verse just takes the trailer to a whole new level ... 

Kr$ Mallom hai na

Is this idea taken from Eminem&#39;s 8 Mile?

Apna khana aayega tu abs le kar aayega hai mota ho ho kar jaayega
Oscar mila?
Apart from kangana,I actually feel this it gives me motivation

Though, it&#39;s a love story. But still, informative and inspiring. Atleast the Indian masses will   treat &#39;rappers&#39; with more sensibility.

Neazy 
Masterpiece

When you realize movie starts from an og kr$na&#39;s Dialogue 

It was a movie with a great plot, actors and songs. It was beautiful beyond my expectations.
One of the best movie of Bollywood, masterpiece Ô∏è

I am here after hearing that Sardar Udham got rejected for Oscar. Some people were also saying that those same jurys accepted GULLY BOY for Oscars, implying that this is a bad movie. Smh

&#39;&#39;khaa meri kasam&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;marr jaayega tu&#39;&#39;???
People must understand that Gullyboy too was a masterpiece. It was based on Divine and Naezy&#39;s Bombay Street life. It involved Zoya Akhtar, Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh. Yes, it involved nepotism. *I&#39;m not supporting nepotism*, but the movie was really not bad. Divine fans must know this. The thing is , another masterpiece called CHHICHHORE came in , these two movies shouldn&#39;t be compared. If compared, competition destroys both the Fandoms. 

This movie is a masterpiece

Can&#39;t believe I took so long to watch this movie...stunned. speechless. What a brilliant brilliant movie    Ranveer&#39;s performance wrings your heart out..this is a classic!!!!! And Alia...in some cases nepotism is great..and she is an example of that!!! She is more brilliant than all the bolly actresses put together 

Who is here after 8 Mile?

8 miles still best...no one can beat it

Aa say freedom
This movie was goodPeople used to praise Gully Boy a lot. Only after SSR&#39;S death same people started hating it.

Ngl but this movie is op

Naezy aur divine best rapper

Divine has a underrated role in making of this film

Very very beautiful

chhichore had story no acting ,gully hoy has acting ,dialogues and story

First line is from kr$

Better watch Original Mile 9  which is way better than this bakwaas remake movie.I dont understand why bollywood need to copy every hollywood movie and even then they make a shit out of it.

So basically the Indian version of 8 Mile? xD

Its a copied story from hollywood movie 8 Mile -2002.

Whole beef is planned before it&#39;s releasing to understand the underground hip-hop scene..

I think almost 99 % of those who hated on star kids after Sushant&#39;s death, including even kangana herself, if they had been in the place of star kids, would have definitely taken help of the likes of Karan johar and yet they hate on these people for doing favouritism. This  hatred shows how immaturity runs through our new age public discourse which is dominated by the likes of kangana ranaut. Even if she is meritorious actor, this hating on others is not just right.

this movie is a masterpiece. truly loved it

the trailer starts wid the voice of a legend 

Lavda boy

<a href="">2:11</a> Spot Ranveer Singh putting on a face covering. May be he predicted Corona times back then 

Ye randapa kr ra hai ye

Yes Gullyboy didn&#39;t deserve an Oscar but that doesn&#39;t means it&#39;s a bad movie .

Alia&#39;s dialogue was masssssstttt 

Such a rip off from Eminem&#39;s 8 Mile movie. Shame on you Bollywood

Zoya Akthar best director Ô∏è
Chutiya actor in a chutiyapa movie! Divine's songs are there in this movie which are worth watching and listening to! Such tatti movies are getting awards in India.. and so they were sent for Academy Awards.
My fav movie for lifetime

Ranveer singh is faadu artist
If they think this is a copy of 8 Mile then RIP to them

Kangana before Sushant&#39;s death: I loved Ranveer&#39;s performance in Gully Boy and Alia&#39;s performance in Raazi.Kangana after Sushant&#39;s death: All stars in Bollywood are garbage.WHAT A HYPOCRITE

So everyone ignored kr$na

Only for KR$NA 

This movie doesn&#39;t deserve to win that awards it&#39;s good but not brilliant

i was never been a fan of alia, but after seeing this movie, i think, i have understand why people love her so much, she is too cute yaar, i have just fall in love with her..

i literally don&#39;t give a F whatever people think about this masterpiece but it&#39;s really one of the best movie ever made in bollywood people are not hypocrite here they are confused cause they don&#39;t even know what point of view have to be followed because they didn&#39;t have their own thinking rip logicsi didn&#39;t watch much movies but when it was released my friend recommended this to me and i really thankful to him for that i really liked it so muchbest performance by all and good story line i know it is similar to 8mile but its not a bad thing about it because its okay to be inspired from a creationand there is a big difference between copied and inspired

Don&#39;t know why people hate Alia yes she is dumb but she is talented and also cute

Only for KR$

Nonsense, all Hollywood pictures' 8 Mile' Has been copied 
Servant's son: Servant has changed now. The servant's son has now become a master.
Nice movie

Allia is real genius

Gully boy is the best thing I&#39;ve ever watched. ...........It deserved that success........it is such an inspiration for all those who feel that their so called bad conditions  are pulling them  back ......I think who have disliked should watch it again and feel it 

Only Hear For A krsna 

Trailer Ka First Word Says Krsna 
Trailer Started With Krsna Voice 
Motivation

Since no one is talking about Alia here , so i want to say about her . She is one of the most versatile and talented actress in Bollywood . She literally did an amazing and outstanding job in this movie . Ngl Zoya should give her more screen time in this , what a great actor she is  but seriously whenever any scene of Alia comes , she totally overshadows ranveer singh , this tells how great actor she is .

And why for heavens sake, this was sent to Oscars? To degrade the value of Indian cinema worldwide?

I am not here to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but this is such a terrible movie. Nonsense, overrated. Till the end, I was waiting for some magic to happen based on the amount of rave reviews it has received. 

I am here to dislike this trailer

Look <a href="">0:49</a>

Why they copied harsh beniwals tummy boy

the raps of this songs are good but this is a not the true story bcoz eminem&#39;s 8 mile has the same story

Gully boy, gully boy, gully boy!

Crappy movie crappy actors crappy crappy story

First voice is of the legend himself $

CHICHORE :Like Gully boy :Comment

Ranveer!!! I&#39;ve never seen a talented human doing what he loves to do with passion like he does For me as an Egyptian not Indian I&#39;ve to say that you guys have a gem, this man gonna take the Indian cinema to another level of greatness

Ohhhh, DIVINE&#39;S life Story

Anyone watching this trailer in 2021?Ô∏è

Ranveer singh is j such a talent actor. He can literally change himself in such a way that you just can,t realize that it is him playing the character

This movie is literally my life story.i also want to express my art of writing stories but my school, family members and friends never like my story.only my mom and some friends of my village and factory like my story

Once a rapper said :-&quot;Hritik Roshan ki gandi Randi Kangana&quot;Not  a Hater of hritik Roshan he&#39;s also my my favorite actors but i felt this line this so hard

When you realise this film was a gem, kangana ne toh tu bhi bhosda khola tha

Today I said that my time will come, but today my time has truly come 
Dream of army lovers this song inspired lots

Who is here after kgf : chapter 2 teaser ..

I&#39;m honestly pretty upset seeing this mob mentality from Indians... I&#39;m in the US, and I was in an anthropology class where we were going to watch Slumdog Millionaire to study the Dharavi slums of Mumbai. I told the professor to try Gully Boy instead since SM is outdated and by a British director. She loved this movie. She&#39;s using this in her classes now to teach about India. Soo... you can hate it as much as you want, but it&#39;s a brilliant movie that&#39;s being viewed and studied by people. Not to mention, ALL these musicians are the same underdogs you say we should support. Don&#39;t just talk, go actually support them.

People just can&#39;t simply accept that this movie was a masterpiece and is giving unnecessary hatred which it doesn&#39;t deserve. If they are telling that alia is a nepo kid then shraddha too is a nepo kid in chichore . By that logic even u can criticise chichore

Both hard
It's a bad movie
Awesome movie Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
I don&#39;t know if Zoya Ma&#39;am or anyone from Tiger Baby is reading this, but I have an honest request to make.. Gully Boy is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved every second of it. I even loved all the deleted scenes and there are many of them. So please, I request Zoya Ma&#39;am to release the Director&#39;s Cut of Gully Boy. If someone can even show this comment to Zoya Akhtar it would mean a lot

Here after Kangana &#39;s big speach on nepotism and short minded thoughts about star kids no offence but if she is really possessive about these thing she should have said openly right there and then when these legends were getting awards and this is actually award deserving but why did she talked about nepotism after SSR death because she wanted footage

Brother, after pausing my movie, I came to this comment that today I came to know that the person whom the lion is fighting in the beginning is KR$NA!
why the Bollywood movies still soooo shity!!?

I dont say its a bad movie it says a lot about underground rappers and there story.. but it wasn&#39;t just necessary to hand them over all the awards. The movie deserved but not each and every cast of the movie

Why gullyboy is getting  best film chichore is far better than this.Chichore should get best film

Everyone must be loving chichore but i love gully boy . I know that alia is star kid but her actions and acting was damn good and sushat acting is also damn good but ranveer also struggled to reach at this level so i think both are amazing but my favorite is chichore if you agree then like if you disagree then comment

I m here only for krsna&#39;s intro&#39;s part....krsna bhai big fan

Trailer Start With Kr$na VoiceK R $ Maloom Hai Na.

They can&#39;t make anything without copying.

Alias fighting is awesome

Kalia 

Great movie! His uncle is a typical ignorant Muslim (well as well as his father). He mentions Allah and mix Him with Hindu cast culture. Where does Allah say you are your family?

Bollywood has not released even a single original movie till date, this is also a copy of Eminem's 8Mile.

Ranveer .....wow acting
Tab nahi pata thaTRAILER ke starting mein KR$NA hai ..OG!!!

lets see, how many people are listening this song in October 2020

Worst ever film in the world

<a href=""> 

Audience is the biggest hypocrite. 1. Number movie is this, Shandaar ekdum. People also bark when they are feeling excited, open the camera and taste the march, people also bark in their stomachs. Chhichhore and these are completely different movies. Comparison is not possible. And if the sister's boys show so much support then why should the groom not go to the theatre. Now there is no need to show Magarmach's tears here. <b>who is here after watching kangana ranaut video.....</b> <b>vahiyaad film</b> aur baaki chuttad baatein. Chutiye log saale
If you have seen 8 miles then you will pause this movie and let it go Dude you can copy the movie but u cannot copy eminem rhymes 4 people can bet this  rhymes B reddit Eminem Slim shedy Marshall Real slim shedy fans stand up 

Before Sushant&#39;s death, Gully boy was a revolutionary film, inspirational film, best film and Chhichhore was vahiyaad film full of cuss words, adult language.. after Sushant&#39;s death, Gully boy became vahiyaad film just because of the word &#39;nanga&#39; and Chhichhore became best film, clean film..

This Movie don&#39;t justice to this trailer

Feel Good Movie 
Its best Ranveer was a Footpath I think Ranveer will be happy Deepika get selected because he will get her clothes

Worst film got Filmfare

sushant was perfect in this movie

We Indians are the greatest hypocrites ever.  Postive comments before Sushant Singhs&#39; (with all due respect to him )  death and negative after.

I felt this was a good movie with real charecters and a gripping Plot. Why hate , just to make a point ??In my opinion what we should hate is movies of people like Tiger Shroff, Katrina etc who have  literally 0 acting skills. Their only talent is looking good. Alia bhatt even though she&#39;s a star kid is a good actress actually.

TRAILER STARTS WITH KR$NA VOICEKR$NA - G.O.A.T

Ye comment Mai sab chichore kyun likh rahe hai... trailer to gully boy ka hai

I Love Alia Bhatt Acting iam became a Fan of her amd Ranveer Combination excellent

It's a stupid movie
How insensitive can you guys be calling this movie a copy of 8 mile when it is a biopic of Divine and Naezy. Apni faltu argument ke liye unhein to discredit mat karo.

There is no comparison between Gully boy and Chichore. Gully boy basically is a social drama where Chichore is just an entertainment film. Nothing else. As per story, acting ...both the films are good. But as per social impact, Gully boy is far better than Chichore.

Came here just to dislike. I didn&#39;t watch this movie. Just disliking the old movies, because no new new movie is coming.

Honestly as much as I would like to hate this movie I can&#39;t cuz its a really gd movie. Mostly bollywood only potrays the upper class of the society but this....... is one of those few films that has ventured into the lives of normal ppl. Evrybody in this film did a wonderful job even Alia .

Just because that Chichore had better &quot;Message&quot; and the lead actor is dead, it became better than this masterpiece Gully Boy... Audience is the biggest hypocrite...Gully Boy is excellent in almost every section like screenplay, director, editing, cinematography, and equally great acting by every cast... Yahaa protagonist ko heroic entry nhi di, aur poori movie me struggler hee rha woh. Moheen jaise character ko kitne pyaare tareeke se likha hai, side aur chota role hote hue bhi impact bana gya..Just because &quot;Ghanta hee toh aaya hai&quot; line hai, movie bekaar ho gyi ?? Aise toh Chichore me kitni vulgarity hai. Sexa, hilata hai, Bunty girr gya, etc. Woh chlta hai... kyu ?? Kyuki movie me ek basic sa message hai ki give-up matt karo... And just imagine if CBI also declares the case as suicide, then toh movie ke lead actor ne hee movie ke message ki aisi taisi krdi...Point is, don&#39;t change your thinking by someone who never talked about the guy when he was alive, and after his death using him for both her film career and political future...

Start trailer with KR$NA voice.

This movie is 3rd class. I dont how this movie get award and not manikarnika If u also think then like it .We all are with u <a href="">#kangana</a>

<a href="">00:01</a> is KR$NA  ..IF YOU NOTICE

Very bad trailer

People; Before SSR death: Wow! This movie is awesome!!!!Same people immediately after SSR death: This is a whack ass movie!!!Same people about 2 months after his death: People are such hypocrites!!!!!!

Whos here after seeing the 8 mile movie trailer comment section?

Wht a  bgm of the film .. mind refreshing

Perfect

Proud that its trailer is starting with krsna&#39;s voice 
Worst film ever

Thug life

Gully boy photocopy of Hollywood movie 7 miles

This copied shit won best film award lol.

Zoya Akhtar and Ranveer thought there would be audience who have less knowledge about Eminem&#39;s 8 Mile 

Mischievous rap
Hello Gully Boy
The actor was not Fit in his character ‚ÄçÔ∏è he was to big there is no Swag on it they should find someone young and fit this Movie or else DeVine him self portraits his story  i definitely not gonna watch this

this is just ghatiya film i don&#39;t know why this film got award 

Best movie..

I like Ranveer Singh not Alia Bahttttt

Zoya akhtar makes awesome movie maybe it&#39;s considered wahiyat now because isme slum conditions batai hai mumbai ki but when movie released everyone was going mad over it!! This movie was awesome in its sense and cinematography was great calling the film wahiyat just because kangana ne ye movie ko chose kiya apni bhadas nikalne k liye is not fair! Maybe other movies are good but this was also an awesome movie and now kangana is saying just abt anything to anyone she see fit and she is going way beyond herself it&#39;s looking cringy and miserable

Ooo maja a Gaya
Nas is listed as a producer..

Hurgdi

What&#39;s the problem that u guys have with gully boy?! Seriously what&#39;s wrong with the film!

Dislike /this video

Sushant lovers dislike the video

Alia acting is so good 
Justice for sushant sinh rajpoot

Alia Bhatt has not come to Kush and is making a film, why did she come, she has made such a dumb bhangar move, make a move of Kush Dhang.
This is a very slow film, how did it get this award, it has not come to the society...Ranveer Singh is mental..
Ab bolegay ke chichore is better than Gully boy but fuck that mindsets becz both movie in  his place best but industry  make problem not movie show your love 

Except Alia and Ranveer the movie was awesome

Let&#39;s Declare Anti-Nepotism Day on 14 June in memory of our beloved SSR Jai HindüáÆüá≥

Bekar Chi thu please dislike all  alia bhatt movies

My favorite song love you so much Ranvir, I also like singing a lot 
Not a hater and i don&#39;t believe in this bullshit outsider and insider thing . But they should have sent super deluxe for oscar instead of sasta 8 mile .

This movie is very worst movie

This movie tells us that gully singers are way better than Bollywood singers

Who thinks that Kesari movie was million times better than this movie

This movie is not at all a wahiyat film.Kangana was just taking advantage of SSR&#39;s death to mock gully boy because of her personal rivalry.I know this movie got some undeserving awards but still it was best film of 2019.The atmosphere of that slum and the language is example of excellent cinematography and not wahiyatpan.If a film&#39;s hero lives in slum, uses foul language and has an unorthodox occupation and doesn&#39;t speak any patriotic or feminist dialogue, that doesn&#39;t mean the film is wahiyat.This film has no match in terms of Best Actor, Best supporting actor, Best Film, Best Cinematography.

The hypocrisy of indian audience is end level Cant really believe some idiots are comparing two totally different films in terms of genre

Good

Ohhhh Ravir Singh is so much <a href="">#Ugly</a> 

Actually &quot;CHICHORE&quot; Movie is better then &quot;GULLY BOY&quot;

Movie
Worst film in the world like for SSR

One of the best films‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
Trade

Chichore is an outstanding movie and gully boy is also a fantastic movie. Some people are just going with flow and now saying that gully boy is not a good movie but these people only were amazed by gully boy when it was released. Everyone was appreciating gully boy and were loving the phrase (apna time aayega). But yes it shouldn&#39;t have won all the awards, this was wrong. Here no comparison of SSR with any other Bollywood actor.SSR was our favorite, is our favorite, and will be our favorite. But don&#39;t change your opinion all of a sudden just to go with the flow Let&#39;s wish justice for dear and beloved SSR 

What a movie....loved it...Ô∏è

Best movie 
stupid movie

Who is disliking all of the movies trailers and songs.

This is a nice movie,no bad comments after SSR death

Chichore is great movie than this nulle wale log ki movie

If they can send superdeluxe. Even we can nominate in Oscar or another good  film .not copied <a href="">one.name</a> film name to copy boy 

Just came to dislike

Itni achi film hai Magar kangana ke chaatu peeche parjaayeinge
Suddenly itni hate kyu mil Rahi hai Gully Boy Ko?

Just came here to dislike this shit

Is this a movie???
Lose your self Thika Onek Sean niche

Came here to dislike after sushants death

The cover has been blown off of Bachchan‚Äôs, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool as their political ties become amply clear ....they are all about their own material gains and fame.

One thing I realised after reading these comments is that Indians are the biggest hypocrites. Man first u hype a movie then abuse now.Why?? Because of shushant?Abe chutiyo jb wo zinda thaa tb tumne usse star bnaya?Audience kuch nepo kids ko psnd bi krte hain thbi ye logg sign bi hote hain.Abe bc yaha thumbaad jesi film famous nhi hoo payi kuki tum loggo achi film pehchan nhi paaate. Aur gully boy is not a bad movie or anything. U just want to go with the trend aur bss isko dislike Krna hain bcoz isme alia hain aur Film fare win kia. Abe bc kudh kuch Krna nhi iss movie ko gaali do jisme bhut hardworking rappers, filmmakers ne kaam kia.Abe phle kudh bdlo. Tbi bollywood bdlega. Wo tumhe wahi dika rha hain jo tumhe psndh hain.

Nice

Gully boy ko boycott kro ..Can't accept this from these actors (only from ranveer alia to he hi .<a href="">#Warrior</a> 4 Ssr .Sun lo .Tum What will you get if you wait for an hour? But now we will tell you..Apna time aayega > 4 SSR
The worst movie in the bollywood who got many awards because foolish people&#39;s in this movie

The public is being very biased after Sushant‚Äôs death. If the roles were switched- if Ranvir was an outsider and was dead and Sushant was a star kid, then I am sure all of you would be going on Sushant‚Äôs videos and commenting ‚Äúflop actor, nepotism, flop film‚Äù. Alia bhatt and Ranvir are genuinely good actors and they deserve the awards, not because they are star kids but because they are good actors.  This film is also good. Chichore was also good. You dont have to pull other films and people down if you liked Chichore.

Bekar picture

<a href="">#MaheshBhatt</a> , A womanizer &amp; Islaamic Dalaal. <a href="">#AliaBhatt</a> even with the womanizer‚Äôs support you have not been able to earn even a 1/4th of reputation and respect that Sushant with no GodFather or support Or Background in Bollywood has earned..Shame on you nepokids, soon your career in Bollywood is on the verge of end so now better to work in augmentation of you qualification and get some genuine degree ahead of +2.Same goes with <a href="">#KareenaKapoor</a> Or <a href="">#KareenaKhan</a> , <a href="">#SonamKapoor</a> and <a href="">#SonakshiSinha</a>Hope after all the spits, spats and kicks on ass, you &amp; womanizer has understood who is Sushant Singh Rajput Thoo On all of you mentioned above ============================We Need <a href="">#JusticeForSushantSingh</a> &amp; <a href="">#JusticeForDishaSalian</a>  We Need <a href="">#CBIEnquiryForSushantSingh</a> &amp; <a href="">#CBIEnquiryForDishaSalian</a>AND REMAND OF <a href="">#MaheshBhatt</a>

Rubbish
This trailer like 8mile eminem movie

Love this movie only bcz of Emiway Bantai and Divine But Disliking  this for Nepotism <a href="">#Sushant</a>

boycott   Alia Bhatt said in coffee with Karan that she wanted Sushant Singh Rajput dead.

Useless movie

Dislike karo

Gully boy is the best and chichore is also best but ranveer killed it bro

It&#39;s embarassing and shameful to think gully boy released in the same year as super deluxe. Bollywood movie makers should learn a thing or two about SCRIPT and CINEMATOGRAPHY from Tamil and Malayalam cinema.

All people sucks who hate this movie ....

All u people who r disliking or talking bull shits don&#39;t forget this was the movie which was selected as the official entry to oscar.and u wer the people who loved and made a bit now talking nepotism bla blaaa. When dilbechara came u were the people who told shits about Dil bechara now dead opposite and started to compare films of different jonours... And don&#39;t dare to talk about aliaa who has been selected to Oscar academy. U may say film fare and all awards are fake but Oscar is not just a word Ô∏è

Wese dekha jaye to iss movie me koi burai ni h mjhe tb bhi acchi lgi thi or aaj bhi acchi hi h

Who is here after harsh beniwal gully boy proof song

Chichoore and Sonchirya is much better than Soty 2 and gully boy!! 

I just watched it and I love it!!!!! Excellent work!!!

Sonciriya 100 time better than this flims sorry sush we just want to see tiger&#39;s 2 rupe&#39;s body building and ranveer , varun copied flim bt not sociriya rabbta kedarnath others

I&#39;ll watch it tonight, Amazon Prime.

Fuck nepotismI hate Salman Khan
8 Mile : LikeGullyboy : Nothing just scroll down.

This movie is a fucking copy of the G.O.A.T Eminem&#39;s legendary movie 8 mile. And the song Apna Time Ayega also copied Lose yourself. Thats why I Hate Bollywood films. They are nothing but master copycat. I&#39;m totally disliking this video. Not just this. Dil Bechara also copied famous movie The fault in our stars and Koi mil gaya copied ET. What a SHAME!!!!!

I have to watch the 8 mile trailer after watching this

Chhichore should have won best film not because it was better but because it had an important message. Alia didn&#39;t have an important role in this movie and she got Best Actress.

Why kangana said that this movir was shitThe acting was totally goodBy RANVEERSIDDHANTALIAAND THE LYRICS BY JAVED AKTHAR SIR

LAUDE RANVIR    TERI GULLIBOY IS SASTI COPY OF EMINEM&#39;S....ALL TYM... CLASSIC 8 MILES.... KUCH.. TOH... CREATIVITY DIKHAO CHUTIYON.... SAB COPY KARTE HI BC....SOUTH YA FIR HOLLYWOOD....

8 mile can i copy your homework?
Filmfare awards giving this Awards Movie like Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress etc. It Reason, because Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt are Starkids. What a stupid Jury to organzie. Shame you Bollywood and Filmfare!Slumdog Millionaire is better like Gully Boy!

Most Chutiya movie I have ever watched. And it won the best movie, is it? Were the judges on dope or had eaten pig shit before voting for it

Otha seruppu must have nominated .. wonderful movie ...who all missing otha seruppu in nomination like here

dog salman dog kapoor
dirty movie ranveer singh and aliya bhatt very disgusting

Have you watched this movie?
god i cannot stand all you fuckers in the comments dishonoring the type of person sushant was and using his death to bash on a movie that had nothing to do with his depression i am so sick of you



Chichoore is the best movie in 2019. Who the hell gave this movie the award &quot; BEST MOVIE OF 2019 &quot; .

Gully boy is good movie. But Chichore and Tumbad far better

Best movie Good story line
Watched it......Superb Movie....Alia and Ranveer and also the other actors in the movie Everybody Nailed it...

Bakwas

Jai Shri Ram
Keep disliking guys.
Nobody knew why he drove &quot;8 miles&quot; What copy is this film?
Wow how people have now started talking negative about this movie. But remember when it was released people were going crazy wearing those Apna Time Aayega T-shirts, chanting Alia&#39;s dialogue. Audience is the biggest Hypocrite. U people are saying Chhichhore is better than Gully boy but tell me how many of you&#39;ll really went to watch Sonchiriya and Detective Byomkesh Bakshi. Audience is also equally responsible for nepotism

By searching on Google, Kangana told her favorite movie of 2019 Gully Boy and today we got the chance to see it, it has got publicity, let's come to the fore nepotism.
Bakwasssss

Now purchased awards
Proud to be a disliker

I don&#39;t know why they are uploaded mono audio track. Gandu lok

Trash movie

Legendary dailogue gully boy jeisi wahiyat film KO 13_13 award mil Gaye or chichore jeise masterpiece KO aik bhi nhi

Nice movie but chhichore is superb than this movie

Very dirty and noisy movie, those people are stupid who like this movie

Such a worst movie Chhichore is 10 times better than this.....Love you Sushant ....Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èWe always miss you ....
This situation completely exposed the herd mentality we indians are famously known for. When everyone said it was good, it was good, now when someone said it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad. Our opinions are never ours, they are always someone elses. &quot;wE dID iT bOyS wE eNdED nEpOtIsM bY hAtInG rAnDoM pEoPle&quot;

All the idiots disliking this video forgot that Siddhant chaturvedi got his break from this movie.

When the trailer of Dil bechara released long before SSRs death, I saw a lot of meme made by people like &quot;hollywood chaap&quot; , &quot;copy cat&quot;, &quot;we can only make copy of hollywood&quot; &quot;unoriginal&quot; &quot;bakwaas&quot; and now see the comment box of gully boy. If there is any villian in this situation, its not bollywood mafia, its not nepotism, its INDIAN JANTA. I am worried about the future of my country for the type of people that live in it.

Ish joya ko award chahiye... Jo 2, 3 film baneke vi ... Director from this film , that film... You are still. Nothing......zoya...

The movie is very good but not like Chichore. Because everyone is comparing Chichore with 3 idiots and no movie like 3 idiots has been made till date.
Fun fact  Gully boy has more awards than 3 idiots, Mughle Azam and sholay combined.What a wahiyat movie this Gully boy was! 

Bakwas film.......

a Flop

Always showing alia as an iim graduate ,medico( liver transplant), student of year , Abe yaar 10 pass hai woh aur president bhi nhi pata I think she was a below avg. Student and sushant was an academic genius which may also be a reason for her envy for him

KR$NA is next level.

You people are disliking this trailer and writing bad coments only because here is a starkid ? SSR ki lifestory  bhi toh kuch aisa hi tha . So atleast please show some respect for the story of the struggle of those people who are just like SSR .

Ghatiya movie

How manyof you say this movie is only for apna time ayega 

One time watch film

Out of 250 rupees, 200 rs were for Siddharth Chaturvedi's amazing performance and for the songs and the remaining 50 rs were returned with overall below average film now I regret.
And some idiots says it is a Flop movie rip to thier mind

Why this piece of shit was sent from India for the Oscars when there were thousand other better films like Sonchiriya and other regional films?This proves why we don&#39;t get an Oscar

shit movie dont watch
Bakwas

Those who r criticising this movie are the ones who are responsible for its 238Cr boxoffice collection. There is definitely something wrong  in sushanth&#39;s death but stop acting silly by  comparing gullyboy with chicchorre, both are different genre movie which are good in its own way. And alia&#39;s acting is way better than many heroine of this generation . BTW i am not a fan of alia though.Stop acting childish

Kati
Please upload this movie

Last year Kangana herself said &quot;GULLY BOY&quot; is her favorite movie and now she is taking advantage of someone&#39;s death.

Ohh god u all can just make such movies but cannot imply them . YES THATS BOLLYWOOD THE BRIGHTER ITS ON THE SCREEN THE DARKER ITS ON THE BACK<a href="">#RIPSSR</a> You were and are still loved

Worst movie

<b>PLEASE DISLIKE THIS TRAILER</b>

It&#39;s funny how people started hating on the movie after Kangana&#39;s video but all you see before that are positive comments. Audience ki hi problem hai. Jab appreciate karna rehta tab nai karte. Hypocrisy 101.

I just finished watching 8 miles,I mean guys seriously... selling chori ka Saman ...bgwn se daro yr

Bakchod movie

Wrong

Alia Ô∏èÔ∏è
People are saying chichore is better but everyone knows the concepts this movie touches be it domestic violence, poverty, underground rap etc is revolutionary. Please hate nepotism but be mature enough to understand that this is a masterpiece. Also before chichore there was 3 idiots which was much better than it. So chichore had nothing new to offer.

Wahiyad film

Yes .. This is a shitty movie. Which shows nothing but the struggle of Small town rappers..... Hahahaha

Shushant best actor

Chichore best movie

Alia acting bullshit
actually chichhore is infinite time better than this gully boy

Dislike this bakwasss...

Stupid story

Nepotism film

This was a good movie, yes I repeat this was a good movie. Definitely not as good as Chhichhore. No way it deserved so many awards. But, I have no shame in accepting this was a really good film with good performances. Just looking at the comments section is making me laugh. This is our Bollywood audience. Double standards of a different level. People are commenting that this is a horrible movie, flooded with such comments. But look at the public reviews, reactions to this movie when it was released. As if this is one of the best movies of Bollywood. No one commented anything negative about this movie. And see now. DOUBLE STANDARDS Mein aur kuch na karu, apni baat par tikna jaata hoon. So yes I repeat, this was a good film. But yea, Chhichhore was way better, Sonchiriya was way better. U may write all sorts of negative things in reply, but I can guarantee that even u said that Gully boy is a great film when it released. So I don&#39;t care. For now, looking forward to Dil Bechara. Usko superhit banana hai (OTT platform mein hi sahi). RIP Sushant  Truly u don&#39;t deserve audience like us.

If u want a proof of double standards among Bollywood audience, just browse through the recent comments and compare them with the older comments below this trailer. Aise audience ho toh industry ko bolke kya fayda‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç

Thank God I have not watched this movie .... Trailer is 

Alia bhatt..useless nepotism product

Whos here after watching dil becharas trailer

Lets make this most disliked movie trailer ever ... we can do this

It&#39;s funny how before SSR &#39;s death ,everybody was in love with this movie .It&#39;s not about nepotism it&#39;s more about talent and Alia is talented. Even if she was not a starkid ,she would have made it to Bollywood.Mock all the starkids except Alia ,Ranbir and Kareena.

Phaltu flim
How this movie got award ! How falthu movie hai yaar ! Chichorey is 1000times better then this  movie

If Alia Bhatt is not present in this movie, then I will see this movie at least 10-15 times. But I can&#39;t see the movies of Alia bhatt, Annannya Pandey and afcourse Karan Johar movie,song,etc. This people are like the  at the EARTH. If anyone like SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT then promise with your Heart that you will not see the movies of these .I am not saying to like my comment, I am saying to support truth.Thank you

Who is abusing the movies? Like it.
This 2 min 42 sec trailer didn't make sense to me! Don't know how crazy it is that you can watch the full picture.
Bakwas movie poor acting of kalia bhatt

Super flop movie senseless meaningless, shamless Alia Booth.

Khali movies tell that outsiders get a chance. In real life, son is the worst, because even now the king's son has become the king...
Another copied movie again !!# 8 mile (eminem)

Only one starkid in movie.

8 mile copy

This movie is on the top of my list of worst movie.

Bakwass movie. No Social Message

Movie

If you dislike it, you will get its award the most by disliking the film.
Another COPYCAT in Bollywood, stealing away awards, like stealing stories, even the scenes from .... 8 MILE (better)The &#39;Akhtar&#39; children lack originality. First Farhan with Don, and Zoya? You people make me avoid Bollywood movies. I thanked God, there were people like Shushant. Now that he is gone...<a href="">#ripsushant</a>. What is left in Bollywood? .... <a href="">#bullyboy</a>

This award was given because of the ridiculous scene in the movie.
Pagel boy dogs movie

Chutiya's rap is
Isse acchi to sonchidiya h

Never watched this movie and never will  SSR Deserves more Respect and Justice compared to these STUPID  IDIOTIC MOVIES

Shame on you Ranbir

Worst movie ever
Fuck this movie

Sadi hui movie hai.ekdm
Guys stop saying its less compared to chicchore.Gully boy is a straight copy of 8 mile.Fake movie with fake awards.Fuck Nepotism

Worst movie in the industry .....oscar movie
Bakwaas movie
who came here to dislike this trailer

This movie don&#39;t deserve a award 

I do not like indian Bollywood movies but these movie gave me goosebumps....you know how the story ends but its simplicity and message is so astonishing....really enjoyed

I still remember the craze of this film when it was released. And now suddenly this movie becomes worst for some people who didn&#39;t even watched the film lol. Anyways after few years this film will regard as a classic. Indian critics are not stupid who gave the film great reviews.

Idiot song
One of the most nepotism reflecting film

Kangana: Gully boy like wahiyaat film ni dekhi mene or usko family fare award diya Karan Johar: I am a young girl to see.
Lora movie
Kich khas nahi hai8 miles ka copy

Sistercood did not give award to chicory
<i>Actually its name</i><i>should be</i> <b>&quot;tatti boy&quot;</b> 

chichoore movie  much much.......much better that this film trust me

I got headache after watching this film pls ignore karo!!!! Is film Koo

People here are being so stupid. Hating a masterpiece. Hating one of the best actors in the industry. Dude you all are emotional fools. Just think critically. Are you all really using your brains or just trapped in some emotional influence. Believing in so called fake news.

Bakwas movie, Ranveer hero looks like a goon in this movie.
Eminem ‚Äú 8 Mile ‚Äú nicely copied ( of course without shame)  No wonder talented  stars like SSR Ô∏è suffered a lot. And he was really trying to do different movies all the time...

Gully boy me muslim dikhaya hlgra islie hypocrite hindu iski pasand nei kia do they trying to compare it with chichore  while the 2 film  is totally different topic based. Come on grow up

Chhichhore  Screenplay &amp; Dialogues are 1000000 better than this Entire movie. Overrated non-original GULLY BOY Best Director - Nitesh Tiwari (Chhichhore)Ô∏èÔ∏èZoya Akhtar (GULLY BOY) WHO agrees??
Fuck film

Apna time aiga

Best bakwas movie

This trailer is so fucken lit. Stop joining the clout . Bollywood finally made a different film and I know all you liked it from the inside but you&#39;re all liking chhichore because it&#39;s the trend . When chhichore came out I watched it in the theatres it was empty, but now it&#39;s a trend so you like it. Both films are fucken amazing understand it

Is this movie's award given?
This is a Madrsod movie aliya to ak Nmbr Ghtya he nepotism sali

Ghatiya muvi or chutiya actors ....mc
Chichore is batter gully boy Che 

Worst  bekar ... Meaning less
A copy of 8 mile 

...kuch bhi kho movie acchi thi.

Is this a copy of eminem&#39;s movie

In 8 mile,eminem was atleast relatable and real af!  But ranveer singh does not relate,he smells of nepotism power,sick man who snatch sushant&#39;s chance etc etc I mean no wonder It doesn&#39;t even deserve the O of the oscar !

If sushant was in this movie,it would be more relatable. Talentless actor ranveer singh snatch this movie from sushant by nepotism power. No wonder why this moviedid not  got an oscar or oscar nominee!Jaake filmfare se hi trophy kharid le sick nepos! Your reality has been exposed and this time for real ! Shame on you nepos! Don&#39;t trust star kids and nepo products anymore! Not watching gully boy anymore!

I hate alia vat

<a href="">0:41</a> note se to tum sab log star bane ho star kids i will boycott all karan joker and salmon khan movies because their scripts is

Alia bitch 

Chutiyoo seh bhari ha yeh movie especially Ranbir and Alia Bhatt 

Bakwas movies

Choron ki wahiyad film
Payal Rohatgi raises a very <a href="">#IMPORTANT</a> point.... BEWARE OF <a href="">#PSYCHIATRISTS</a>.... actually <a href="">#brain</a> is a very <a href="">#delicate</a> organ, but <a href="">#pharma</a> lobby &amp; psychatrists do not care/know and prescribe <a href="">#meds</a>/<a href="">#drugs</a> that can really hamper proper brain function.... If you feel depressed... do <a href="">#SERVICE</a> to family/needy and listen to <a href="">#RAM</a> KATHA <a href="">#SATSANG</a>, eat <a href="">#FRUITS</a>  and you will <a href="">#emerge</a> out of it in no time..... DON&#39;T BUY &quot;Depression is forever&quot; dumb theory invented by Pharma &amp; propogated by the <a href="">#evil</a> of <a href="">#Bollywood</a> 

Alia, Sonam, KJo, Sslman, YRF&amp; Mahesh Bhatt are <a href="">#EVIL</a>

Who all think chichore was much better than gully boy?

No doubt it&#39;s a good movie but Oscar me bhejke bestee karake fir 13 filmfare deke movie ka mazaak hi bana diya 

Fuck Alia bat
This movie is not wahiyat...it has received more awards than necessary but the movie is still there, that's why it is 8.1 on IMDb.
There&#39;s only one good, self made actor in this movie. Who can name him?

What a trailor...hats off

What a stupid movie?
This movie was good. Ranveer‚Äôs acting was good, we dont deny that but giving it all the awards and ignoring other good movies and especially giving alia best actress for her 10 minutes performance was straight up absurd and unfair. RIP Sushant

alia bhat tatti acting

Joker.....

Joker actor

Don&#39;t know this film... Came here when they talk about this... It&#39;s just a copy, indian dont do rapso funny BOLLYWOOD COPY INDUSTRY

Missing movie...
I hate alia bhatt now onwards I like more sushant Singh rajput Who like sushant Singh rajput hit like

The hero of the rap picture is not the real rapper...Rapper should get the role of a rapper...Rapper should be the hero. Want to get a hero role...
Laughing at all the hypocrites in the comment sectionFirst they blindly worship gully boy and then just because kangana said gully boy is a bad movie they make the issue gully boy Vs chichore and suddenly star hating gully boy and worshipping chichore to get likes  The issue is not gully boy Vs chichoreIt&#39;s outsiders Vs nepotismSociety Vs mental healthWe act mean towards people and don&#39;t give a shit about them , ignore them and when they kill themselves we act like we cared for them.If you have even a little bit of respect for Sushant then stop treating people  and your classmates badly because every life matters equally....I think that is what Sushant would want...

It&#39;s a copy of 8 miles and they are sending this shit movie to Oscar I mean........Are you kidding me!!!!!

I have only come here to dislike this .

8 mile right
It is our fault that a masterpiece movie like Thumbbad collects only 13 cr in box office with no awards and this shit collects 165 cr with 13 awards...shame!

Fully Faltu... Bohot hi ghatiya film

Maa ki chut inki. Make it the most disliked video. How the hell that it got all the awards???

worst movie

With me, Who else Dis-liked this stupid video after sushant death ?????

Revelations
Faltu movie...

Hopeless...
plagiarised 8 mile with eminem

Sab se ghatia movie

Who gave this sugarcane or film award or did not even give a single film of Sushant this much hit that now this tin actor will flop Salman Khan Karan Johar Alia Bhatt Kutte Kamine
Who think spoof is better than this trailer......

flim v tatti aur acting ka ky khu 0%acting level of alia and other actor. es movie sy acha to south movies ho ti hy

Faltu movie

Guys, by disliking this video, show that we the public can do something for real actors like Sushant sir...
