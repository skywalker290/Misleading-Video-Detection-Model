Considering that your chances of survival when driving straight into a wall are pretty damn good, we should definitely consider Mercedes evil

Feels good to have a different comment section

nice hand dip in pants !

hi

That meme was saying Americans can&#39;t buy or drink alcohol at 18 but they can die in a war...

Felix : You are not jokerKids during high school in ASIA : Are you sure about that.

Did he sit on the dog

memes never ends because pain is everywhere

Re self-driving car issue, it&#39;s a false dichotomy. You wouldn&#39;t design it to decide whether to sacrifice the driver or the person they&#39;re hitting. You&#39;d design it to avoid both. Whether or not it succeeds one way or the other isn&#39;t entirely a result of how it was designed. There are other factors.

he said I never seen a well behave chihuahua and now he own one 😂

Yes.  Dr. Mario was the best.👍

The Waffle House has found it’s new host.

Pewdiepie more like screwdiepie
Felix leaves the chat Edgar enters the chat

so, if you have a hydrophobic piece of cloth and you cum on it, would it be considered a cum biscuit when it hardens ?

“Jumping is just vertical walking “ pewdiepie

This aged awfully

Edgar is best boy

<a href="">3:27</a> well when I was in high school the guys a few years above me always taunted me for being a “nerd” so I think it’s much more recent that “nerds” became cool, it’s definitely changed a hell of a lot since I was in early high school though

Always knew the meatballs were to good to come from cow

<a href="">6:09</a> Happened to me once but with a happy ending. My great grandma had bought me a game for Christmas that was what I wanted but for the wrong console. I thought she just got the wrong one, turns out she gave it to me before she was suppose to 😂 I got the console later as another Christmas present

not this again lmao plants do NOT feel pain

Eu plug is 220’its got to be safe lol

“I have never met a well behaved chihuahua”I immediately looked at my mom’s dog and realized she was on the fucking table. How?

His expectations are solo, beautiful

My pug is full of gas... So it&#39;s kind of transfat.

<a href="">1:35</a> sneaky pewds pun? &quot;my expectations are already Solo&quot;?

Everyone with job DONATE TO WIKIPEDIA

So you can get a mercedes thats like a heatseeking missile when it detects an pedestrian or you can drive by your self.

Sometimes my cousin would connect to her bluetooth speaker on max volume when watching TikTok and it&#39;s so annoying that you really want to punch her but I respect whamen so ok.

IFKR ONE DAY SOME RANDOM GIRLS IN MY APARTMENT CAME TO MY HOUSE BECAUSE MY DOG WAS CUTE. THEY STAYED THERE FOR 2 HOURS. the next day they rang the bell, i ignored them. they never came back again

Is he russian??

Everyone gets presents at their bdays ...what I get as present- plum cfakesFuk

This is when the world started ending....

Felix: &quot;Dr. Mario was a bop&quot;Me remembering Dr. Mario: <b>Button mashing in the harder difficulties</b>

<a href="">14:35</a> - me, but it was the principle

The Tom Scott video was about why the British plug is better funnily enough

My brother-in-law’s pug used to be a <b>circle</b>Sadly the pug died of heart problems..

Jokes on you im a vegetarian with cotton seats 😎

lol that kind of is Europe in a nutshell, &quot;thank the nerds&quot;

I don’t know how to add friends on discord either

I love that pew WATCHES youtube too. Watching tom scott videos n sheeeiiittt. God damn i love this man

32 years old i lived thru it pew

I love that you touched on pet obesity. The amount of dogs I put on insulin a week is disgusting. Thanks!!

start the end of the videome: Wait WHat th FcK is that Shit game, Literaly.

On yhe real though. Stop overfeeding your cats. They will lasagna and complain, but that is because they are a cat. If you want something that doesn&#39;t complain when it is hungry, get a vasectomy or the female snip-snip and a robodog.

Although I see what Mercedes was thinking, if the vehicle can still manage to protect the driver, it would be better to swerve away, saving both the driver and pedestrian instead of running over the pedestrian when the driver could potentially be safe even in the event of a crash.

<a href="">2:53</a> surely high school cant be bad for everyone

If its dark memes Can you call it migga?
Literally lived through the shame of being an absolute video game nerd in rlementary

There are well behaved chiwawa there just....extremely rare  A 1% chance(Ik I butcher  that spelling...but I&#39;ll fix it when I can)

High school isn’t bad

<a href="">3:09</a> it looks like Edgar turned off his dog mode

&quot;Let&#39;s get the cow out of the bag&quot; -Pewdiepie

Kinda random but pewds looks like my uncle 😂
Top Text

The cow out of the bag.

vegans when they realize eating plants kills animals that eat plants

Yo sayin that you paved that path for us ok cool but do you have to grow up wearing the glasses from up with curly hair

Meme: Cool math GamesPewDiePie: Math Cool Games😏
<a href="">1:42</a> &quot;And my expectations are already Solo&quot;

Bad times coming

In denmark you can buy alcohol at 16..

Did he just on his puppy at <a href="">3:17</a>It&#39;s big brain time 🧠

@<a href="">1:41</a> pun intended
<a href="">3:12</a> rare shot of a wild pewdiepie with legs

I did that fridge thing

lol the thumbnail be like when that one kid in your class remebers to the teacher we have homework and it is friday

Finding out Peuds watches Tom Scot videos is the final straw. Now I am officially a Gamer.

I feed my cat the same as a 4kg cat but he is 7kg for no reason I think it’s genetic. Vet says he has big head so it’s he is never gonna be small

Poggers for God

Your expectations for the new Star Wars are “SOLO!” Haha get it? I’ll find the door

“This makes me wanna commit some crimes not gonna lie”

Now my high school sucks because of something that happened when the month this video was posted

I don’t over feed my dog. It eats my other dogs food and gets very chubby

<a href="">5:51</a> whats that anime

Even I thought I was special 😢😢😢

What a god, converting his wife to android

Not gonna lie, but this video has 6.9 M views.

&quot;My expectation for another star wars film is so-lo.&quot;

if you kill a killer than there are still the same amount of killers in the world. What if you&#39;ve killed before killing the killer.

Dr.Mario was my favorite game on Nintendo I think we had

+1 thirsty hobbo🧵🎗
pewds likes doctor mario
If you’re willing to take the risk of buying a self driving car, that’s on you. The pedestrians around the car didn’t choose to take the risk. They just happened to be there. The car should kill the driver, not the pedestrians.

lmao wut anime is in <a href="">2:44</a>?

<a href="">10:17</a> me who didnt know the fridge light closes

Pewds are you sure you played math cool games and not cool math games

Apple is like the supreme of the tech world

star wars is the memes

<a href="">1:08</a>&quot;Gym companies on the 1st of January *2020*&quot;Ouch

<a href="">13:55</a> it honestly would be more like who would survive you in a car getting in a crash or an old person getting hit which would most likely instantly die if tesla has a very safe car it definitly should drive away from the old person or stop if possible of course but like if you were in a car driving you probably would swerve out of the way to not hit the old person so that should be the appropriate thing to do

I love that this vid has 6,9 million views, nice

“People used to get bullied for being nerds” sir I had to defend your videos in middle school

This video has 6,900,690 views hmmmmmmmmmm

and then pewdiepie sat on edger     the end

If the 21 kid said 9+10=21It’s true, let me explain. So 9+10=19, how many number were there?, 2. Add 19+2=21 you found you answer, now who’s the stupid one now?You’re stupid for reading this

Vegans when they discover the rainforest is getting deforested to plant more soy

Nah you are special but the fridge thing i tried so many times

Link of this subreddit pls

Edgar is so cute.

<a href="">13:50</a> sometimes using a break also works

Can we just sit back and laugh at how stupid funny chihuahua sounds lol

High school was the best time of my life....

Pewds: Shewawa

The prickly luttuce traditionally analyse because temperature coincidentally recognise throughout a tame truck. female fertile, black sky

I&#39;m not like that with my cat though. I don&#39;t think we meant for him to get fat and we have cut down his food, especially since he throws up a lot. I also started trying to feed him on a schedule 3 times a day. If you wanna see my cats, or just pets, they are on my channel...but Bookers is fat 😂.

<a href="">9:06</a> it is so fucking annoying, especially when they blast rap.

My cats don&#39;t react to pspspsps

<a href="">3:11</a> what is going on pwedipieWatch him carefully

ngl everyone exaggerates how bad high school, i mean i dont like it but stop acting like its actual hell ( i mean unless you get bullied or got home issues and that ect)

I like how Felix says chihuahua
I&#39;m honestly happy I&#39;m not an animal person that gets so into playing with my friend&#39;s cat when hanging out with her.I&#39;m more focused on her feet.

Pewds jealous of everything that&#39;s Marvelous 😂😂😂

The gym one hit hard, they broke now

how dare you adam driver in the new star wars movie is fantastic bc i love him

Wait... you can just push a button in the fridge to turn of the light..? 👀

Did he really say MathCoolGames?

Good thumbnail

Dr.Mario is a great game I agree

That “gym company on 1st jan 2020” meme didn’t age well

Felix actually kinda looks like Henry Cavill

So no ones going to talk about how Pewdiepie just sat on Edgar

Pewds acting like being a nerd is cool now: It still not being cool to be a nerd:

i have solved the refrigerator door light thing, there is a switch, it turns off the light and is lined up so that it will be presse by the door when it closes

peanut

I dont like your memes but i respect you
Pewds: &quot;Nothing makes me feel more like a boomer than not being able to add friends on discord&quot;Me, who couldn&#39;t even sign in:

G

<a href="">11:37</a> Ask MKBHD. I quit watching him, dude got so pretentious and annoying. I mean whatever, his videos are fine and can be very useful for tech consumers and enthusiasts. It’s also good to have a voice in the tech review/unboxing space that doesn’t constantly shit on Apple.  But his videos defending $50k Mac Pro, monitor stand and case wheels had me eye-rolling big time.

Bruh my Chihuahua is nice anyone can pick him up he doesn&#39;t  bite and  he does what we tell him to do (he doesn&#39;t know cool tricks tho)

I have a chihuahua and honestly it’s true. He poops in the house and there is nothing I can do to stop him he has become too strong.

Me in high school in lockdown seeing the world and in front of my eyesPewds:&quot;sure it won&#39;t be that bad&quot;.

get this man  a medal

I didn&#39;t even know what discord was till the other week lol

This one time I asked my friend x-box or play Station he said pc

The grocery store i work for is vegan/gf based.. Someone had the audacity to call and ask if we sold vegan cat food. Please don&#39;t do this. [Edgar is so sweet]

Pewdiepie: Surely high school cant be bad for everyone. Why is everyone pretending to be the joker.....Me: you wouldnt get it

69 meme would&#39;ve been best in mxr

Actually, my generation paved that path felix🥱😎

The being able to drink at a bar at 18 but not being able to buy alcohol personally until 21 seems like a really dangerous rule because I would much rather people be able to drink in the safety of their own home first and then do it socially once they learn decent drinking habits

Pewd predict the next batman battinson <a href="">2:13</a>

So he’s visited the nsfw reddit... SIMP🍆👌PP SMALL!!!!!!

I went on a vacation for a month and let my grandma feed my cat, I come home and she is double the weight

Tho I don’t get bullied for being a nerd I do get called gay just because I am wearing a 4 colored striped shirt.

<a href="">2:04</a>Me: But what if I kill two killers and then I kill myself?

I had a big brain so I just pushed in the button when I saw it gets pushed in

I was made fun of for liking the Powerpuff Girls from 2nd grade to 5th grade. (I still love the PPG tho)I was like 8 and the main bully who made fun of me for liking PPG LOVED Pokémon.. his reason for bullying me was so stupid though, he made fun of the PPG because it was old. POKÉMON IS OLDER!and then a group of girls made fun of me because one of them told me to look up PPG Books in the school library, and then when there was no result they all just laughed at me.Not fun times, kinda wished I&#39;d bunch their faces. Except the guy, he learned to be nicer to me and not be rude for no reason and I respect that.

<a href="">1:09</a>Well, what irony...

Felix:I don’t like catsUllla Britta:*sad minecraft cat noises*

r/memes is actually pretty disappointing, all the memes there don&#39;t fall into any categories just have weird logic or flow and those people&#39;s sense of humor is different than everyone else.

(<a href="">13:40</a>) That car is malfunctioning, as it is going to run a red light. Something is wrong with that car already. – But say it was red for the pedestrian, and they decide to walk out anyway. Then I morally would say that the pedestrian should die over the driver, as the one in the wrong was the pedestrian. – But the issue is that the driver is never in the wrong if the car is fully automated.

lol my mother still plays Dr Mario ever since she got into it during the NES times. Nowadays she&#39;s playing it on PC with a modern controller, using a NES emulator I set up for her.

Are we not going to talk about the rare footage of felix&#39;s legs <a href="">3:11</a>

The logic behind the car thing should be that it sacrifices the pedestrian because you shouldn&#39;t cross the road when a fucking car is coming anyway. Not that a person who can afford a self driving car should live as opposed to someone who has to walk everywhere, that&#39;s how it comes off when you explain it.

Omg, been so long since I&#39;ve seen Edgar. He&#39;s gotten so old :o

Hi

I didn't like it, I think it copies Lubatv a lot (Ironia)
If you look closely, you can see pewdiepies legs at <a href="">3:10</a>

You&#39;ll still be made fun of now for being a nerd

I already watch this video

How the hell is Felix alive he is 30 years old and pies live for 2 days🤯

Please play granny

Hello

Who’s here after pewds took a break

When growtopia? I want to get dislikes.

It&#39;s funny how Felix say that channels with useless information are awful and shows a Tom Scott video the goes to say that he enjoyed learning how the U.K. plugs are safer from a Tom Scott video.

I had a chihuahua mixed dog (we don&#39;t exactly know what she was) and she actually was very well behaved. She never barked, always behaved whenever we took her on a trip and was child-friendly (which was the most important part to my parents). I miss her, she was the best dog in the world.

OMG THERE IS A FUCKING BUTTON IN MY FRIDGE, I HAD NEVER NOTICED

<a href="">3:24</a> actually yes I can relate

My chihuahua was amazing and I swear I’m not lying😂 he was the best R.I.P.

shu wawa

Felix the cat: <b>exists</b> <b>stupid memories of gran Colombia</b>

Afton:”You know foxy with FNaF 1,2,3,4,5,6” PewDiePie:”What?”Me:”I’M A BOXY”

<b>when u dont feel phone in ur pocket</b>me: <b>thumbnail</b>

Haha the cat looked like baby yoda😂

He sat on dog
Wow felix really loves his world of warships, ya know?

<a href="">2:07</a>

Did he sit on his dog

Pewds gone because he is secretly running for president for that island plan of his

<a href="">4:45</a> my friend is Romanian but lives in England so she was on the phone to her friend back in Romania and I could make out the words devil and chihuahua because my uncles dog was Barking at her everytime she tried to stroke him.

:v

HEY PEWDIEPIE! YOU SHOULD PLAY BTD6! (please. there&#39;s a youtuber that would do a 1 million sub face reveal and I need your youtube god powers to help him get there!)

felix&#39;s expectations were &#39;solo&#39;. haha very funny.

<a href="">4:40</a> I’ve literally never said this about all dogs since I have a chihuahua too.

Jesus christ for once i am genuinely happy that my country is poor because car idiots whose numbers here are unfortunately high wont be able to buy it

<a href="">3:00</a> because everyone is a joke!

Why tf does he pronounce it &quot;Shiwawa&quot;

Who is here after pewdiepie apocalypse? 😭😭

Although I understand protecting the driver, if a car hits a barrier the driver has a better chance of survival than the pedestrian getting hit by a car

Fact: swedish meatball will never read this!

There&#39;s an abandoned power plant where I live. They finished building it and never used it. I guess a few or more years ago they shot a scene for transformers there. Not sure if they used the scene in the movie or not, but I remember it being the talk of the town for a whole year lmao.

Pewds: &quot;Let&#39;s get the Cow out of the Bag&quot;Does he mean to say: &quot;Let&#39;s address the Elephant in the room&quot;?

Hey neither of my pugs are all that chunky. They are lean not very mean because pugs are not mean dogs and they are super cuddly and adorable and I love them.

My Chihuahua behaves really well but I still hate her because she&#39;s a Chihuahua

When pewds talked about being a nerd before it was cool, i felt thatNOW YOU ALL THINK ANIME IS COOL BUT I REMEMBER YOU SMALL BRAINS MAKING FUN OF MY NARUTO MANGA IN 4TH GRADE.

Baby Yoda should be meme of the decade because this decade was a series of middling-highs and serious lows, but virtually everyone can agree that Baby Yoda is cute and brings out the best in us. It&#39;s the one thing we can all rally around, no matter our creed or faith or politics, and I think that&#39;s great.

Btw, the Tom Scott video was about UK plugs.

<b>The thumbnail</b>

But what if I am that killer and I do suicide

@PewDiePie can you react to r/animememes?

What is the sauce of the anime in <a href="">2:45</a> ?

<a href="">12:20</a> our plugs are different where I am from. With that said the non EU plug looks safer because it has a 3rd prong that looks like it&#39;s meant for grounding an electrical current in case of emergency.

Pewds: CONVERT TO ANDROID Me with an S10:👈 😎👈

<a href="">3:10</a> Where&#39;d Felix&#39;s hand go-

&quot;I PAVED THAT PATH FOR YOU&quot; ok boomer

<a href="">6:03</a>  you just did xd

&quot;never seen a well behaved chihuahua&quot; um, what about Mr. Marbles

<a href="">11:20</a>It makes me happy to hear you care about your pets so much. ❤️ A lot of people abuse their pets by overfeeding them and it’s a good thing you said something Felix. 👍🏻

You&#39;re right tho, if theres a dog (or the rare friendly cat that likes being petted) I just go straight to that and can just pet for hours and I consider that a great time. Plus obviously I&#39;m socially awkward and pets are great.

Moving his PP in <a href="">3:10</a>, PERFECT

Me: depressed never was Felix: let&#39;s hug it out Me: omg I&#39;m suddenly depressed

baby yoda is just minions evolved

ME* hOW DO i LIKE THIS.eVEYONE oNE . pusH the 👍, ME WHERE?

<a href="">12:34</a> my best friend that ive known for 6 years whenever he comes to me is too much with the dog and basically all the time with him.

Count how many times does PewDiePIE said ok?

It&#39;s kinda scary seeing Edgar with grey muzzle, cause I remember him when pewds  first got him as puppy it seems like yesterday. So much time has passed.

<a href="">5:08</a> Same here

Yes he didnt get hit with the ftc
