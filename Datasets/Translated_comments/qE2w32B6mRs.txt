Me realizing normal lifestyle is better than these star kids lifestyleI&#39;m better than them

JUSTICE FOR SSR 
most film stars father and mother are different cast and afraid to each other&#39;s

What does your family know about their earning..you all know.. avoid this problem. Tori hai on the screen. Bts mei krti hai.Public of india n media are nonsense smtimes
Seems normal for teenagers and young adults to be with friends, dance, eat out, party. Didnt even see any beer or alcohol or drugs here. Media lies

<a href="">2:09</a> Touch no one in front of the camera.
Such a shame at looking at this bollywood has been ruined  rip bollywood unfortunately

Alcohol is a drug also

Their kids know that they have money and can do anything in this society.

Our group of friends would go to amusement parks or just have a lunch or dinner at a restaurant or meet at a park and just walk and talk. Never thought of doing all this. And we&#39;re not poor we had money too. It&#39;s just about teaching your kids the right things.

<a href="">5:35</a> who is he Sidharth nigam I know he can&#39;t but

Ha Ha Ha Ha 
I want to see these star kids face while answering the jee advanced, main and neet question paper

Imagine those hard working middle class students who prepare for JEE, NEET and other competitive examination........ No matter to which religion we belong whether its Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism etc when we are middle class people respect each others religion, culture. We stick only to our parents&#39; earlier hardships and try to crack exams. We forget to go to family function in X, XI and XII and these starkids take drugs in parties.......... We dont make any girlfriends but these cheap starkids parents themselves are involved in extra marital affairs. We respect our elders...... They split on thier elders. We respect feminism.......... They do shits for pseudo-feminismWe middle class people if suffer from cancer, we understand our financial loss but never ever do any bad things.............. And these nepokids, they take drugs no matter if they are cancer patients or not.For our education, hunger and thirst our parents even die..........Though belonging to rich parents they are still X, XI and XII failed. We know how to study......... They dont know even that except EnglishWe NEET aspirants........... Yes I am a NEET aspirant......... We NEET aspirants always forgets all GF and BF relations but these people they have a lots of GF.......So shamelessWe are Middle class people and I am proud to be a middle class person.

I didn’t see anything wrong in this. Don’t be garib and jealous Desis by hating on rich kids

Bollywood addicted to drugs, mars the end of generation

Tumlogose hamari party achi

That&#39;s there life drinking is legal they why the mess and speaking of giving money to  that&#39;s kid it&#39;s  their choice. Probably he is making a bank begging 

While Madhavan&#39;s son is in to swimming....

father and grandfather's money
They really think Bollywood is something to be proud of 

Bollywood ka Baap Tollywood 
Why don’t you guys let someone live their life? Seriously don’t act like a looser.

I cant careless .... their parents dont care so why should I care .... if got better things to do with my life then focus or read so much in to so called  stars or thier kids .... Not interested let hem drink do  drugs do debauchery to thier hearts content

<a href="">6:16</a> moment was.........

<a href="">#RIP</a> SSR

Yes can see in <a href="">#aryankhan</a> case

Don&#39;t force itself into other families private lives they not bothering others rite or creating problems on street they HV their families to take care of them  mind ur own business

They on a boat not harming any one their private life then don&#39;t make a mountain out of mole hill  create problems unnecessary they in their own cars not bothering others rite

Iits a party around 4 walls not on a road side

It&#39;s a individual&#39;s choice what she or he wants to do. Many other kids also do drugs and alcohol but no one knows them because they won&#39;t bring TRP to channels so they don&#39;t get attention. People who don&#39;t have their own status comments on other people&#39;s status otherwise no one gives a fuck about others life till they are not a part of their concern. <a href="">#bullshitmedia</a> <a href="">#chutiyamedia</a>

It&#39;s funny that even their friends that are with them also acts like they&#39;re celebrities too ...lol 

Boycott Bollywood

I just feel that they should be left alone. Following them everywhere like bees won&#39;t yeild any good. With great fame comes great responsibilty , but come on they are just kids. They were born with a silver spoon (there&#39;s no denying). So what do we expect them to do. They are not common people and their lifestyleis completelydifferent. We must accept the reality and move on . And its not just them partying or clubbing . Every teenager does that...or dreams to.... someday. Its fine as long as they are in their limits. That&#39;s all.

ZEROS OF NEW INDIA

Don't watch any of his movies or follow him on any social media.

Lol half of these kids look normal

Now Navya is doing social service 

And our nation&#39;s foolish common man becomes fan of them

Yes, even to a normal log, they do it by showing the same to a few people that they can learn how to do good.
Indians icon starschildren....
Amitabh bachan granddaughter looks like the guy in 7up

world full of pro sti tttttuuuss... pros world. shameless idoit people everywhere.

Seeing so much negative is visible how shallow and dirty minded people themselves are and then they judge people . They are age 18 - 23 where many youngester does behave like only few good kids are exception . Even the tiktoker , social media influencer behave like these . People should mind there own business they are rich so they can party and enjoy . You don&#39;t have so only getting jeleous

Father did not earn fame and did not raise children from fame.
Bollywood ke pure kapde uttar chuke hai.

How they live their own lives is none of our business. They aren&#39;t using public money to fuel their own lives. Rather spend sometime figuring out how your local municipal councilors, MLA and MPs are spending your hard earned money.

Useless kids with their shameless parents(allowing their children in all this) Both are a useless garbage on this earth.

Spoiled little kids,,,then parents wonder they turn to shit..

Very cheep

Comment section is full of butthurt jealous people

This is an insane breach of privacy.

And these druggies are going to be the future role models of India??

Nepotism

Yes, Sharukh may spend lakhs on beta drugs but he cannot give even 10 rupees to a poor person.
Star kid my foot These morons are actually defaming there parents reputation which their parents had made with intense hardwork and dedication

Bollywood by cut

There are some kids of baloon sellers kids of people who are somehow able to manage money for food so you # media go and help them highlight them not this useless bullshit ok

Shabash Bachan family's culture is clearly visible, this is what we call it as the main child of the family.
So, they are going to be the future stars? MY FOOT

Druggist sala bollywood mc bc

Y madrechod log hume sanskaar sikte h
i mean seriously! Why are u making star kids that are haven’t even entered in bollywood a part of this drug shit! Like suhana she looks normal idk how u think she looks drunk or high! Stop doing this for views or likes pls it’s about someone’s reputation.

It was said that Thaliii Nayak Boycott
Oh Bhenchoo Inka attitude to see ....just like the moon first came to them

I hate drug party 
Just because they are having fun it does not mean they are high. More proof is needed. Don&#39;t jump to conclusions y&#39;all. I&#39;m not saying bollywood is not guilty. There are baddies . But don&#39;t jump to conclusion

Deshbhakt Akshay's son is hiding so much.
What&#39;s the point of hiding the face when everyone knows who they are????

USELESS BUMS TARNISHING BIG B&#39;s name.

Please stop saying sir/madam etc to these F demons guys. How these a*<b>*</b> are fooling the people and faking their F up life.

And we put these pigs' offspring on the sky. I'm not saying about all actors.

All sater kid my love my favorite

These media people are so jobless... who are these people? What have they done for the country? Why are they getting so much attention?

The Ambani children have more money than all these star kids inheritance combined, yet the Ambani children have more culture values, class, educated, and drug-free. These star kids are just losers.

star kids are lucky

Thats why akshay son acting weird. Now I understand why he was acting psycho

What a life

Thali me cheed

They thought Bollywood career was guaranteed...so no worry of image...company background checks .criminal checks for jobs....but what will they do now ?  Poor nepotism kids...Bollywood  as we knew it..is dead.

I think this video is enough for jaya mam , must watch

If they are doing drug and if you have proof give it to NCB but its not good to disturb or de-fame somebodies privacy or troll the kids.....drugs should be reported not to be presented here for public to get TRP.

This is my new YouTube channel, all friends go and subscribe once, then I will contact you<a href="">
This is shameful to see famous celebrities of Bollywood allowing to party with drugs. This can’t be the future of youthful nation India 

Bullywood Gutter

Media hi chutiya...bkl bina matlab gaand mein ghuse jaa rhe h inn chutiyon k

Media is to be blamed...y cnt they stop gvng them importance...

 JAISA BHANGEE NANA.. WAISEE NANGEE NAWASii
See how Akshay Kumar&#39;s son is hiding his face all the time from the camera there are all drug addicts this is the reason why Akshay Kumar is also not speaking anything. We want these people and their kids blood test to be done Akshay Kumar represents himself as the fittest person on earth but his own son is taking things like drugs.

They are like porn stars,specially by seeing JAYA BACHHAN S GRAND DAUGHTER

Jaya dadi bhi apni granddaughter ke sath aur beti ke sath nachle drug party me faltu parliament me shor krti h pagal lady

Shahrukh Khan's daughter drank drugs and also got Navya.


Mrs Bacchan kindly see the holes in your own thali...ha haha

They should not be in Bollywood. Because of our family's actions, they should be in Hollywood's porn industry.
This glass is still in my hand...
They&#39;re so fucking funny
Ban these drug addict kids

becharon ka &quot;career&quot; banne se pehle hi udd gaya  ssr in this same age was tutoring engineering aspirants, while these useless self obsessed creatures think that clicking a few selfies in drug induced state will make them loved by millions. I wont even spit on these useless cratures, forget spending any money on their upcoming movies. We lost a gem among these stones 

Maa baap drugs child trafficking ke kam karenge toh bache drugs hi lenge

BHAND SALEY
Jaya bachan thali wali you watching this

Disgusting specially the bachchan one ‍️

Real truth of Bollywood partys,

What did he do to the people who took selfies and chatted with him? Why so much media attention?
These kids behave like celebrities without achieving a damn thing in their life!!!! Why is this media giving them so much attention?? They are nothing without parents money and people&#39;s attention.

They are  f and  f

Where do you see drugs in here?????.................

Araav to papa askhay- modi uncle ne pub-g ban kardiPapa Akshay - koi baat nai beta fau-g loAraav to papa askhay- drugs peddlers are being hunted Papa Akshay - Canada's citizenship is available to me and ganja is legal.
Show this to Mrs Jaya Bachchan and then allow her to speak in the parliament,her grand daughter is also their in this video

Baap big druggie toh beta bigger druggie
useless to watch these valueless people.

they are poijonus for the country.

Role models of this generation

What&#39;s their identity?Whay have they actually done for the nation?What have they done apart from going to the pub amd clubs?All nepo kids who are nothing but druggist.Hate Bollywood. Killers.

This is the arrival of all good people
born to celebrities, these children are actually very lonely. They can&#39;t mingle with other children, except with the children of other celebs

Super rich and super poor, on either side of the car window...what a contrast!!!

You are so useless on Bollywood...
These kids act like Stars from now on...I think they haven&#39;t completed their schooling as well. :P

ITNE PAISE HAIN!!! CHOTE BACHCHE KO KUCH DE DETE

Show Jaya Bachchan her granddaughter swim suit video! Then let her talk about sanskar taali mein ched and all! Janta is the one who made then reach wherever they are!

They shouldn&#39;t be the next stars at any cost. Star is a precious word. They should be tagged as &quot;trash of the society&quot;.

Sab ke sab drugy h ye

It looks like drugs and boose is just like tea and coffee for them.

Best to expose them all everyday 

Gutterbollywood

stop following these assholes in the first place.. who are they - just star kids right? why even cover them in media? I never got the craze that people have for them.

No education but drug and sex for the youth icons.... What a shame

Everyone is going to eat his own food for nothing.
Amitabh Bachchan daughter should get job in the dance bar

<a href="">#BoycottBollywood</a>

These years, he wouldn't even know how to clean his kitchen properly. Why do media people give so much importance to these years?
Horrible parenting. They have money so they can do anything they think but what’s the point they have no values or ethics always in nasha

Parents themselves take drugs and why not children it’s the high society thing, they feel proud about it. How stupid???

We r living good  life with our family at home better than these nashedis........ inko pata hi nahi ki inka ghar b h...pura din hotels m pare rehte h

Oh this naughty patriot's son, he is sucking my cock as soon as possible..
What does this video wanna say ??

Jute padne wale hai inko....

Thanks

Amitabh ki grand daughter bahut garib nikli.

Seems like some high end brothel

most cheap and vulgar was- NAVYA NAVELI. THU THU AMITABH BACHHAN DISLOYAL AND HYPOCRITE DOG OF NATION.

When there is a mess in the warehouse, it will come out like this in the showroom.
Sweta ki beti is just gone too far at very young age...no offense..enjoying life but must avoid illegal drug if any.

Their parents boycotted their parents so much that these children did not have the courage to become actors. You are going to face them all the time.
most of the clips are fake. those are not the people that you are trying to they are

Thali mei ched nhi thali hi fati huyi.

Ghinine log. And you people make them your role model. Ye tho besharam he lekin isne zayada vo besharam he jo inki or or inki maa baap ko movies dekhte he. Tum bollywood ko dekhna band nahin karoge tho tumhari halat bhi in lafandro ki tarah hi hogi.<a href="">#BoycottBollywood</a>

Inke maa baap hum public se he fame or paisa kamate hai.. Oos paeso se inke bacche aish krte hai... Or ye log hum logo ko he attitude dikhate hai...boycott Bollywood inki aukat dikhani hai ab...

This is the actual reason why Bullywood is supporting Rhea Chakraborty....

Or are their parents talking about fitness?
I don&#39;t know...why people still Loving the starkids and following them.....???????

First media should stop giving attention to these useless Nepo kids.

Video banane wale kitna labor karte he..Kudos to them 
<b>Worst example for future generation.</b> Drug addicts &amp; peddlers must be shot dead by a special squad. They poach teenagers to become addicts. It&#39;s like a MLM. All drug users become drug peddlers to sustain their habbit.

Today there is no one more insulted than these.
They look so cheap. This is so much money. Mother does not give clothes on father's money to her children.
Who are those girls at <a href="">5:22</a>

These are the ones who are begging for good money.
Is this the video ujjwal trivedi is talking about?

In movies, their mothers and fathers play such honorable roles. In reality, even the worst dons have killed the scoundrels. Idiots of all.
It is a big mistake of people to run in front of star kids. Suhana and other star kids have not even started working and have gained millions of fan following. It is a mistake of people.
Such a poor girl doesn't even have clothes.
Akshay ka beta to moo chupa ke bhaag raha tha.Akshay bada lecture deta firta hai fitness ko lekar.

There is no need to teach them, Father and son are all the same ignorant donkeys.
They have dug up their own news, but today they have to destroy us from our culture... India should not be like this generation... If we can be proud with pride and see an India, there is a need to save it. hai.....the beggar who is free from all the people...who is robbing us of his rights and praying to us...<a href="">#Indianeedtounited</a> <a href="">#Boycottbollywoodloobymiagangnepotistjokers</a>

I am never gonna waste my hard earned money on these drug addicts jab ma baap karte hain toh aulaad toh karegi hihumare bacche aise nahin banne chahiye inko hi yeh gandgi mubarakho

That's why such a long and wide dialogue had died in Parliament. You serve drugs in the same plate in which you eat..&#39; Madam was afraid of her granddaughter getting caught. Your daughter-in-law's son is better than your daughter. Only names have been mentioned. Now the name of the daughter and her daughter came up in defamation.
Plz share your importance with these people and give them importance plz bnd kto aapne aap aap sakhaane aa jaenge kya hai media ka Khushi madam Khushi madam
They do not get clothes to wear!!

Nashedi ganjedi ???
This is the result of bad parenting by so called star druggies !! And these people will be getting movie so easily without any struggle just by attending these drug parties..And the   greatest struggler like Sushant will be killed by giving the name of suicide..

Jaya ji ko koi bataye unke bachhe phele hi thali m ched kar bathe h to dushro ko kyu blame karte ho?

Brother, first of all take a selfie with him.
And this #### will be upcoming stars &quot;my foot&quot;. Our ancestors were correct nautaki walo ki kimat hamesha do kaudi ki hoti h inko na toh role model banana chahiye aur nahi inki desh or policy pe koi advise ko seriously lena chahiye. Chanakya was right abt state policies.

This hypocritical bastard
NoT drunk, high on hard drugs.. That&#39;s why everyone hiding eyes. ..pathetic, shamless thali of bullywood
