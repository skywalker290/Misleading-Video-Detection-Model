Is the ok  sign ruined by the white supremacists?

WPWW

Or a 3 pointer?

God bless everyone and have a good day!,.

Ah the jet set radio music

Sounds ok until you actually think about this argument for more than 10 minutes.

documemtary pewps

 white power and ok symbol 

He clickbaited me but I’m  with it.

<a href="">4:25</a> another  <b>PEPE</b> 

<a href="">2:51</a> but from thee ashes of PEPE.....<b>CAME SOMETHING FAR WORSE!</b> 

This is what happens when people give in &amp; don&#39;t push back.

Milk is a hate symbol according to the ADL because white people can drink it but Jews are largely lactose intolerant...

what&#39;s the music that played at <a href="">0:26</a> and <a href="">4:50</a>?

What the hell does &#39;co-opted&#39; mean?

The swastika represents the 4 seasons!!

Bro I forgot pewds was the one talking

Can we get more these mr internet man? I had fun...

back in 2020 my brother had the ok hand as a zoom background as a joke. He had no idea that it was a hate sign. Eventually a teacher noticed it and talked to him as well as making him change his background.

Thumbs up is also an offensive sign in Iran which means “sit on it” an indecent and offensive insult

Thanks PewDiePie! This was really helpful. And you&#39;re right about stuff like this becoming what we allow it to be come. Great job

Wow, I didn&#39;t expect a serious and thoughtful analysis of something out of Pewds... Bravo

This is not okay

Ok
This entire subject is hilarious and so petty. In my town a certain group of people thought that any not tied on a plastic bag represented a noose. LOL

The real story is pepe was a 4chan meme and didn&#39;t like how it was popular on reddit and other normie places, so they made pepe into something that would scare people, so they would avoid using the meme.

Idk why I loved this video it was pretty cool. I have never seen Pewds be like this for a particular video but this really had to be talked about. Damn lol xD.

Nice pewdiepie the n word user and anti semite is now lecturing about pepe being hateful

Pepe, was imprisoned by the nazis, and  was killed in jail. At least they let him out for the funeral.

<a href="">6:20</a> the swastika is a Buddhist symbol and we still use it. Its seen in temples and buddhist schools.

The lesson here: people will get mad at anything, justified or otherwise

i cook wokes in my wok

Yep, still relevant today %
so basically people are saying that ok sign is bad symbol making bad people want to use it, and at the same time making people who like it as a joke get mad at the accusors

<a href="">6:19</a> Pewds, you&#39;re Scandinavian, you should know that the &quot;Fylfot&quot; is as old as Proto-Vikings and cavemen. Found all over the world. The Hindu flavor Buddhism is relatively late in using it.

The left wing is crazy

hmm... Why is all this bs happen in U.S?

Just say that it&#39;s a BLM symbol viewed from above

Peace among worlds! 

So stupid....so trolled.  People will believe anything.

Pepe is saved the right wing frog is pepes final form to beat the rainbow mafia

Ok sign is hate symbolWhile Indians: (while doing head bubble)ha ha very(nice).

The trump photo guy really made ha ha made you look sign and he was successful everybody looked.All i see is people trolling by saying Ha ha made you look in videos and pictures.

Woke West: Swastika is a hate symbol.India and Japan: <b>Bruh</b>

welcome to another day in humanity 

This is actually my favorite PewDiePie video of all time.

Pepe is bad

Rip Italians. 
Damn, pewds is definitely big brain on this video

XYZ, abcd
No

anyone know what the name of the song is from <a href="">5:00</a> to <a href="">6:00</a>

My English professor just went off on a kid in my class who talked about Pepe in his paper…

How does marzia feel about this. Doesn’t she do 
2030: youtuber pewdiepie proved to  be white supremacist by shameful word said called &quot;hi&quot;I am disgusted

The most interesting videos of Felix have the most random titles

I can see <b>the thumb of one race</b> actually being a real thing…hopefully i’m wrong

That child that threw up the &#39;ok&#39; symbol was obviously indoctrinated by the adult racist into hating their own race. 

Matt Furie acting like he invented Microsoft. But c&#39;mon bruh, it&#39;s just an anthropomorphized frog...

dude pewdepie was in a cartoon bro fist from pewdepie was created in teen titans go but i think they still did not remove it even if some ppl say its a hate simble

when he showed Pepe I heard someone  shouting and it felt like he was saying pepe

The media can be convinced that a high five is a hate sign

<b>u wot m8</b>  
I love when pewd makes these very rare creative vids. Even the matrix vid was so damn different but was so relaxing

a little late but the funniest thing about the whole &quot;Ok sign&quot; white power thing is that it&#39;s always a white person complaining about it being a dog whistle for White power. I haven&#39;t seen a person of colour actually complain about the ok sign being an offensive method of displaying your support for white supremacists

I never heard this white supremacy symbol, we used it all the time here.

I now declare American Media Full of Idiots in my brain.

 the thumb of one race Aaah man that was so funny

XYZ 
Anyone else think Felix should narrate books on audible or something?

What melody is at <a href="">4:50</a> ?

What was the backround music, it sounds very nostalgic. Is it from jet set radio?

Good to know that D-Von Dudley, a black wrestler has been flashing the &quot;White Power&quot; sign for over 20 years.

I want more content like this

This video is pretty 

R.i.p pepe
We love Pepe
Great takes

One pepe to end them all

You know what? The Mayans were right. 2012 did happen. But not the way you think. Slowly but surely people have been offended by the absolute stupidest things.

Pepe

pepe the frog to pepega to nfsmw pepega mod

I&#39;m going to die

I love Pewds

This is so cool I want this more

snowflakes

You know what the strangest thing is? The fact that these people allow symbols to be defined by white supremacists, rather than the other way around. Why on earth would you treat the opinions of Nazis, who believe that the Holocaust never happened, as even the slightest bit true?

The bowl hair cut Is a hate symbol well Now i get why i had no freinds when i was 6

With how stupid the media is. Soon, Rick rolling will turn into a hate sign..

ok hand gesture added to the hate symbol listDivers: guess Ill die

the start of the video is just <b>chef kiss</b>

 is a hate symbol now because you not doing about  anything  bad things happening. Hahahaha

Didn&#39;t watch the video the first time through, came back to finish it after thinking about it more, and I agree, I think this video of yours contained truths that some people who are very invested in current american politics would rather ignore.

A

Racism in my opinion is just wrong and obsolete. Its also overused and at this point I personally feel is a crutch sometimes. I&#39;ve seen people claim racism just to spite someone who isn&#39;t even a racist. I&#39;m Hispanic grew up around black people and just about every other ghetto demographic and not a single slur bothers me because I choose not to give it the light of day. Sensitivity is our issue and bad people know it so they&#39;re gonna take advantage of that to ruin what good we have. If we just stop letting the racism effect us and maybe harden ourselves a little bit there won&#39;t be any energy for these bad people to feed off of. Moral of the story grow tf up and get over some shit because its gonna end up getting worse and you may end up being a better person in life for letting something so trivial as racism go. Slavery has been abolished all around (Colombians which I am were also slaves during the banana wars but you don&#39;t see me saying kill whiteys) though it still happens with human trafficking and what not I think our goal should be to stop feeding power to these terrible people and one way to do that is to not give a fuck about what they say racist or not. Like bullying eventually it stops if you take the right steps to chew through it. Let&#39;s grow together instead of tearing this world apart please

It’s a cartoon frog...people are giving this much influence to a FUCKING CARTOON FROG!!!

So I don’t know when but I know this was  before 2020 because I was in school, anyway I was in gym getting pictures and  I making the ok sign and they told to stop so I did, and now knowing this I’m hoping that if one day I ever get famous I hope it doesn’t gets find

Least he didn’t mention moon man

People are pretty stupidFrog? More like racistOk sign? More like racist

a

COOL 
I know you ended up here desperate, JN newsboy. 
Swastika is an Indian symbol mostly used in our culture. Stfu western media

Well, its 2021 now. Now we&#39;ve got staff from Bolsonaro doing this purposefully while deaths in Brazil reach exactly 300000 people.Maybe it&#39;s time to reevaluate? Or nahInternet culture is what it is. It adapts over random criteria and basically behaves like metastatic cancer. It&#39;s not traceable. But chemotherapy or radiotherapy does exist.

No you
Superstraight is the newest 4chan troll campaign and tik tok is spoon feeding 4chan reactions

Its a fuckin frog, its a fuckin hand!

Lmao and people still believe those news channels.

Truly the before pewdiepie came

<a href="">9:02</a> why do we have a capibara passing judgment on people&#39;s ideals?

HahahaA society that wants to destroy people&#39;s lives because they made an OK sign and you complaining about your little Bro Fisting? You&#39;re all peas in a pond.

ಠ‿ಠಠ‿ಠ
Wow how truly introspective. Someone killed 51 innocent people in your name. Take some responsibility. If Neonazis are overwhelmingly using a symbol, it becomes a symbol for neonaziism. That simple.

Good video nice to see common sense in this time, where common sense is lacking.

The title got me XD

That moment where 4chan is above the goverment

People are bloody stupid...

i like this style of video

I would still use the Bro fist 

See how much nicer the world could be if we all used the inside of our head like Felix?

Wait so I&#39;m actually White not Asian?

We are BROFIST
Who else noticed the dr. Mario music

The Swastika is also &quot;just a symbol.&quot;

I can&#39;t watch this video all at once my blood is starting to boil

<a href="">6:04</a> wait? There’s no sive?

What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccckkkk is the world coming to?

It was a troll at first but It is being used now by white supremacists all over the world and acting like it isn&#39;t definitely isn&#39;t helping the situation.

Such an underrated video

The news are really wack these times

Bro first is going down

What a beautiful life to be a person who thought an OK sign, pepe, and brofist are supposed to be a hate symbol, I just don’t get it Karen and Kevin. 

Person: <b>breathes</b>Media: NO!!! THAT&#39;S * insert dumb Karen reason as to why breathing is bad here * 
This is the most serious PewDiePie video I&#39;ve ever seen

What sign do i use when I go diving now?

WHY THE CRABS MAN

Someone make cnn symbol become racist lol

congrats US, u out stupided ur self(ik stupided isn&#39;t a word but idc)

Yo pewds i love you but, you know you&#39;re being like a useful idiot for these white supremacists don&#39;t you? They want people to believe that is &quot;just trolling bruh&quot; and use it so that if they get caught, everyone who points it just be called hysterical. You do remember Richard Spencer saying that Pepe became a symbol just before being punched in the face, so to say they are spread and used because of media report is just stupid, not denying the possibility of people doing it just for trolling but to say people were using just for the keks doesn&#39;t make sense.

<a href="">4:52</a> Klubbas theme from donkey kong 2 lol

I thought the thumb and and the pointer finger was an o and the others is a k

and they say political correctness after the 90&#39;s isn&#39;t a problem.

Pewds should really make more of these

It&#39;s just so cool that Pewds does these occasional types of videos, it&#39;s like a specialized therapy just to even out the chaotic humor :)

For those people still wanting to know what the song at <a href="">0:26</a> is: It&#39;s a Jet Grind Radio Soundtrack - Humming the Bassline. You&#39;re welcome, have a great day!

ITS AN OK HAND SIMBOL U ACTUALL DUMS

ITS AN OK HAND SIMBOL U ACTUALL DUMS

Pls make more things like this

This feels like a documentary.

why is the bro fist a hate symbol again?

Based

Groot scares me
4chan did it.
Okay handsign is a hate symbolThe letter F in sign language: 

Is this a documentary from pewds???

we live in a society.

NEWS: Pepe is saved by Peepo Animation

someone: breathessome kid on the internet: THAT&#39;S OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH

ayo please make another video like this, i watched it a year back and i rewatched it again today

If anything exists it the media immediately says it means white power or white supremacy or some other racist sounding bullshit.

i caught an ok symbol in a zach king vine and zach king did it!!!!

Get flexed on wignat

Wait, why is Harry Potter talking about hate symbols?

12 was my favourite number it is the best number now

Lmfao, I know a black guy who does the  joke all the time. Why are there so many SJWs in this world?

Reasons i fucking hate people
i love 4chan, it creates so much retardation. i absolutely hate the UI of the site tho.

One year later I am finally finding out this apparently meant white supremacy 

All this is meaningless to me, I have a post-racial mind.

media: pepe is hate symbolHong Kong freedom protesters: haha pepe go brrrrr

Big brain I got what you said 

Me: <b>*FBI wants to know your location.*</b>

This is why i like 4 chan

&#39;Ok hand sign is offensive&#39;EmKay: 

nice clickbait
Pewds is actually an amazing host of a documentary channel

I&#39;m done with humanity. Like are divers using the  supposed to be white supremacist

The ok sign is also the universal diving sign for being ok

wtf

The news is stupid they think that pepe the frog is a hate symbol they should abolish the news because there doing it for money

just imagine someone whos deaf and uses sign language doing the ok sign  and him just getting beat up

The OK sign was flashed by the Christchurch shooter, who killed 50 people. He wasn&#39;t trolling. This video misconstrues how hate symbols work.

People got offended really quick these days like they can&#39;t even take a joke Haha

Today marks the 1 year anniversary of this upload

But what about the bowl haircut? How is that a hate symbol?

Resurrect pepe

This is the 1 problem with diversity: if ppl do almost any action, there will always be that one group of ppl or person that find it offensive. Soon saying &quot;hello&quot; will be racist because it supports white supremacy. So dumb

<a href="">5:48</a> i dont think he was trying to flash the sign on public news, but just one of my crazy conspiracy theories/

The media did it

dang

I think, therefor I am antisemetic

pewds unusual vids

...   ........................... ok
felix makes such a genuine narrator

:/ :(

Pewds: I&#39;m tired of editing.Also pewds: <a href="">6:12</a>

This world is so effed up

Who’s watching this in 2022 and saw clickbait

How stupid can people beThis is not 

Pepe  i miss that meme it got me into stupid funny photoshops of memes
The alt right is a cancer

Man I can’t wait for the new movie The lord of the memes!

Idk why ppl think this  is a hate crime

Why is the media always putting bull shit in symbols and the symbols become bad

Me: goes for a punchThat one kid: OMG hate crime!!!!

If anyone got bad vibes in my last comments I meant it a good way sorry if anyone misunderstood it

I will make my house a bro fist no matter the damage it does

Justice for andpeace 
i think we people need to start ignoring the hate symbol and speech list as it clearly turns anything into something it&#39;s not.

Pepe is nothing compared no my papaPapa franku

I hate people that do this with memes

Now I know why people is laughing when I do the ok hand gesture

BLM!!!

Ok boomer 
If it is a hate symbol then why does this exist-&gt;Edit dontntake this the wrong way

A

Y u be useing lord of the rings clips

Scuba divers now knowing the OK hand sign is racist: * chuckles * I&#39;m in danger

All I have to say is 

2021: The Peace symbol has been declared as a hate symbol

In the Philippines it is a presidents symbol lmao

where was the part about the brofist

HARRY POTTER

Some people are dumb
WHAT IS MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND <a href="">0:28</a>

O.     O.    OO.     O.    OO.     O.    OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.   OOOOOOOOOO.             OOOOOOOO.           OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Not poggers

Lovin the LOTR refs

Feels bad man

now there are at least 6 million people that know the truth about pepe and the ok symbol and that they completely innocent and ok to use

do 2 ok symbols, now close 2 fingers except the index thumb and middle, turn the one upsidedown now you have brown power

This is humanity we’re talking about pretty soon it’s gonna be offensive to be alive.

It&#39;s meeeeee
THE ok hand is the demon sign its  666  this emoji is hiding the last finger so it&#39;s not demonetized its an optical illusion

Seriously I don&#39;t know why these Boomers even bother thinking they know shit in the current world

 Gotta
Rip Pepe the frogFeels bad man
Rip pepe ;-;

People are dumb is that why I don’t see the brofist anymore️

pp 29
my parents saw that i had a pepe as my gmail account (just a random pic on my pc) and made me change it feelsbadman

We need more content like this..

What the hell&#39;s going on here

Its all cnn and msnbc

I feel so bad for em kay

Why did clickbait me
In my contry

I hope idiots realise that the OK sign is the ok sign not a racist symbol. These lies give a bad meaning to it even if it was normal. I hope they realise that the more they repeat this the more power racists will have. Also ik im 11 months late to this.

<a href="">0:45</a> me and the boys Meme

Bruh, the news are just saying these things to get P A Y E D !

World: it isn&#39;t racistAlso world when someone does it:

Welcome to meme world

Alright these guys are pretty regarded thinking the ok  sign is white power like how do you think that?

 Ha made you look
You think this is worse? The OK symbol is banned because people think its White PowerIn Indonesia the word &#39;Anjay&#39; is banned because they say its offensive. When it is supposed to be a compliment, sometimes people are just not thinking and tearing their nations apart.Edit: If that was offensive then why does Android Phones and iPhones have this symbol 

What&#39;s a hate symbol is subbing to the CEO of YouTube.

<b>slaps the table</b>This is why I hate humanity

RaCiSt

Imagine making a meme as a hate symbol

boomers when told what they are and when medias class being shownGo Felix

Hay look =D 
Not a hate symbol

Pewdiepie#
Is a)

I tht is was 12

Logic at Its finest keep up the good content Pewds

Okay I give up now it Democrat’s

Demoncrates

Goddam Demonstrates

And Who else is watching this in 2020

This Is SOOO Ridiculous

The  sign is a white supremacist symbol?Jesus, the boomers minds have more imaginativs minds than Phoenix Wright


Your like a meme teacher

I swear to god USA gets dumber and dumber with every passing second.

I honestly never knew this,Thanks for the meme education poods

People who advocate censorship are no different from fascists. The people getting upset at these symbols are the very threat they claim to fight against.

The news don’t really care about the meaning, the6 just want their story.

B.The number 12.

If you get upset by this game you are a sissy

Loving the new format. Keep this going!Wait...

Okay hand sign guy was not the white supremacist.1 supremacist remains.

I hate people read take thing too seriously it&#39;s like  We&#39;re just trying to be funny and it doesn&#39;t even mean what is in there is little evidence but now you&#39;re in a try to call us out for no reason we&#39;re just trying to be funny

I actually got the 1st question

Pepe is not really dead the creator said he is waiting for the word that Pepe means happy and no More mean pepes

He is going down on history as the man who stood up for memes..

How dumb are we?

Yo, when he gotcha, he gotcha, he gotta brofist you with much force.But seriusly if I had to be in a war, I would pick PewDiePie&#39;s side.

i love videos like this where they sound like a documentary on memes

The government, am I right‍️
Please, Jesus wept, please (I&#39;m not religious, just a turn of phrase) but Felix is a nice affable, erudite and seemed learned human doesn&#39;t mean you take his word for gospel (truth).  He&#39;s trying - with humour, to encourage you to think for yourselves.  I for one enjoy the videos I have a chance to see.... but, formulate your own views. Nowt else to say.  Diolch yn fawr

Rip pepe

This guy is so funny and jokey but when he wants to find out about some thing he can really get the point across

<a href="">4:56</a> what is the backraund music

That humming the bassline in the intro is awesome

They’ll do what ever they can to change something so innocent to a racist hate gesture

The bros are still aliveBrofist 
What I see:What the media sees:
Pewdiepie lowkey looks hella good
The ok sign is also scuba diving sign language, rather than using thumbs up which means head to the surface, the ok symbol means everything is ok. So by the logic of this is that all scuba divers are white supremacists

Internet: The ok sign is a hate symbolJohn Cena: You wanna fight me boy?

lol how bout now eh
U mAd BrO!?!?
me: ∞ just infinitypewds: okme: pewds: &gt;:(me: gotem
Hey dudes,Gottem 
Pepe will forever be my favourite emoji. Change my mind

I&#39;m here after watching the new documentary about Pepe ....Feels good man

Bruh it just means: “very nice”

next time smiling is gonna be a hate symbol or something.

 What about people that cant talk...

Vietnam
2030s be like: breathing is now a classified hate symbols because its ovensive for dead people!

Me after watching this vid 

this emoji won’t last long make the most out of it

I love the Lord of the rings

I mean I&#39;m not gay, but Felix looks fuckin&#39; great in this video

Love from India 

2030: hey man cya later  Friend: RACIST BIT-

pog

the people thinking its a real hate sign, are the same people destroying portland for 100 days etc etc. rarted clowns

Swastik came from Hinduism

We miss you pepe

Now this is some og content

I know everyone here is either 9 or 19, but please watch a movie called Waiting from 2005. It&#39;s got Ryan Reynolds in it before Deadpool. Thanks, I will go boomer now

I dont think we will be able to evwn colonize mars with this much stupidity in out planet

pepe is on mah discord :P

Did they actually blur the ok hand gesture wtf.

nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pepe
I know that frog as the bot dank memer on discord

<a href="">5:20</a> imagine being tracked down over an ok sign

&quot;By acting angry and upset about these things, you are giving validity to the symbol&quot;I wish I knew that back when I was offended by cancer jokes

This is just boomers criticizing all the new things and resisting changeExcept the versions of pepe that never should&#39;ve been made

I mean if you think about it bandannas were turned into a heat symbol because they’ve been associated with gangs and robberies over the years so that’s how they were kind of turned into a hate symbol

12, Blowl cut,  (just kidding, love your channel)
Don&#39;t be racist we are all even

U mad America a message from England 
Conclusion : parents and politicians are dumb as they thinks memes and video games are bad

Danm riot must be feeling dumb right about now

its ok boomer

me : does the ok symbolalso me : wait why do i hear knocking.FBI : helo

Imagine a deaf person being arrested for genuinely saying ok. I don’t get how white power is a hate symbol but black lives matter isn’t. I’m just saying that it’s pretty similar.

Clickbait thx

he is back.

I will forever circle  and okay sign people. Never ending it. Okay sign stands for I&#39;m okay I will dominate your butthole.

The news just love turning the tables. But they trolled themselves with looking in it and talking about it, cuz you usually just laugh or make an annoyed face. (btw I know I&#39;m late)

DANK MEMER

This is the dumbest video you&#39;ve ever done

what&#39;s the music at <a href="">4:50</a> guys?

 why is it still in the emojis?

Looks Like Fellas its world war III

Wait,.Are chef now ok 

Ok I&#39;ve seen lots of this on the internet, and I don&#39;t know which meaning to believe.

Pepe is a symbol of Hong Kong freedom movement now so Pepe&#39;s not dead, he&#39;s doing fine

&quot;The ok sign means white power&quot;Bruh thats like saying the high five means Fuck you

The adl is a white supremacy group

I think that WP should stand for world peace

ok, here&#39;s the thing, people created these memes to make funny stuff but these adults are trying to ruin memes... they already ruin all of the pepe memes, i can tell their next target is pewdiepie.

(Disclaimer: I&#39;m Andrea&#39;s son) Any ways. I&#39;m from the future. Pew news is a thing now.Pew new: Pewds talking about internet culture? Pew news status: Dead?

damn 4chan 
whats the bg music at <a href="">5:00</a> ?

What if non white people do the OK sign.

Why did I think that I was watching a Pyrocynical video

I completely forgot this was a PewDiePie video for like 6minutes

Great videoPewds.                                                                                                                                         
a is a hate

I hate the fact that people will be outraged over anything. I bet that in a few years you&#39;ll get called racist for just dropping a pencil lol

Bro i thought this was pepe documentary

Dude you needed it to be 8 seconds longer dude

Media: The &#39;OK&#39; hand symbol is a hate gesture.People who speak ASL: ... ok then

Someone : <b>THE OK SYMBOL IS OF WHITE SUPREMACY!!!</b>Me : then explain this

Swastikas were used all over Europe and Asia even before Buddhism

The ADL is giving the tribes people freedom from even the smallest of criticisms

water power

To the sjws, 

I hate that media believes everything so easily, its just so stupid

They ruined pepe &gt;:(  he was me crush

What did I do wrong

Why do the news and idiots have to ruin everything

The Emojis are liekIm keepin it Frick it 
You have stopped all hate signed

Okey -_- 
I love how history repeats itself, ever heard of the red scare or McCarthyism same rules apply when people go around virtue signaling thinking there&#39;re doing the right thing but don&#39;t consider the consequences of their actions

the &quot;circle game&quot; has a rule where it has to be &quot;below the waist&quot;. pointing the fingers downwards literally means &quot;asshole&quot; in AmericanSign Language. (look it up. fact check true) It was a way to say, &quot;look at my asshole&quot; as in &quot;try and hit this.&quot; Catching someone looking below your waist meant they were checking you out, and thus you could hit them... Unless they were able to poke their index finger in the ring and break the circle. (tear you a new one). In which case, they could hit you for attempting to present a target.TL;DR3 fingers up, index touching thumb is American Sign Language (ASL) for &quot;OK&quot;.  3 fingers down, index touching thumb is ASL for &quot;asshole&quot;. combine the 2 for &quot;OK, asshole&quot;poking your index finger repeatedly into an inverted &quot;ok&quot; sign actually means what you think it means in ASL.

The circle game was a kids&#39; game, so it taught kids to be on the look out for pedos. Also taught them what to do when they found one (hit them, or else you win &quot;a new one&quot;).This is how it was taught to me, back in the 80s (like the timeframe of &quot;the Goldbergs&quot;).If there&#39;s a different explanation, please let me know.More fun facts:Middle finger up, pinky, ring and index curled in = ASL for &quot;fuck you&quot; or &quot;where is tall man?... Here I am&quot;.  Index finger up, all other fingers closed in = ASL for &quot;one&quot;.&quot;One&quot; symbol repeatedly poking other hand&#39;s palm (with other hand open, fingers pointing up) = ASL for &quot;cock blocking&quot;.&quot;one&quot; symbol repeatedly poking tip of other hand&#39;s &quot;one&quot; symbol = ASL for &quot;gay&quot;.hand in a fist is rock or &quot;bro fist&quot; invitation.open hand palm facing down or with thumb up is paper or handshake invitation.Index and middle finger extended, all others closed is scissors, when the fingers point up, it means &quot;two&quot; or &quot;peace&quot;thumbs up means yes or okay, or online &quot;like&quot;.thumbs down means no or dislike.thumbs up resting on top of other hand (open fingers with palm up) means &quot;help&quot;.open hand, touch front of chin, then pointing fingers of open hand to someone means &quot;Thank you&quot;Bro fist = ASL for &quot;Ula Britta Smitta Fritta&quot; or &quot;the furniture is assembled, zero deaths, you&#39;re welcome.&quot;

why would they do that it did nothing to them

2040: love is now a hate crime and very offensive.

everything has to be racially charged these days smh why cant ppl just get along

Lets pretend that the earth is actually roun...Pointless comment for pointless people

Guess the meme 

Is she Sarah silverman aka the voice of wreck it ralph girl

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Pepe

He protecc He attacc But most importantly...Bring the BroFist bacc

I keep telling my dad this and me calls me an idiot and says its all fake and won&#39;t stop hitting me

Pewdiepie.. the hero we don&#39;t deserve.. but the hero we need.

watching this stressed me out can&#39;t believe people are this stupid

Let’s make the Democrats logo into a hate symbol

PEpE iS a WhiTe SupREmAcy SYmBol

All adults trying to figure out a way to fuck up simple shit

Pewds out here saving all of the meme lords in 1 vid

Most of these are hate symbols specifically because of 4chan. The power of trolling has become too powerful.

That crab conveyor belt is actually really sad

The bowl haircut is a hate symbol to my eyes

I’m guessing all three are hate symbolsEDIT: I’ve never been so disappointed in being right

Finally someone who actually has evidence to back up their claim

Pepe was co-opted but by Trump supporters. I&#39;ve never seen a white supremacist posting a pepe meme. I agree that white supremacists probably support Trump but so do many others.

The hell they gonna charge the ok-ers for hurt feelings?

we could actually not give an F about what they say and continue our daily lives on the InternetMedia: How bout I ban it :)?

Well Played

respect for the jsr music

this video was great.

&quot;think being arrested for say ok&quot;

People are so stupid

Memes sound 
What about...
Don&#39;t touch my Pepe

B I N O D
Damm Our School must be racist then

Im not even white but I use the OK symbol all the time! Does that mean I can&#39;t make that symbol at all? Smh...

Everyfink is reycest my dudes

This is clickbait

But I feel OK most the time so this makes me angry   if people think it is racists (this is the Ok symbol  it means OK..   Are you stupid people all colours use OK. But some people want people to get told off for using ok are mean (this is the brofist .) but this is waving . ‍️‍️‍️‍️
So if we spam a persons face they become a hate symbol right?

Sooo thats what happend to the frog 

These boomers need to chill out

I honestly don’t even consider the “hate signals” as hate signals.

Nice vid Pewds. 
Whyyyyyyy!? 
it feels like the media hates fun or something

Hey pepe is still in jesse background

OMFG in Hungari we use to say it is fucking good bro lik the hit dog that you eating at the moment.

12

I guess all divers are white supremacist.

Rip

in my country when you shake ur hand while doing the ok hand sign it is usually used for kids meaning &quot;im gonna beat u&quot;  (not actually)

Wp   haha got em sry im bad person
IF YOU ARE GONNA LIE ABOUT THE BROFIST I UNSUB

If the ones reporting weren&#39;t complete robots and didn&#39;t go along with every script they&#39;re giving and would say this is wrong the world would be a better place

Is pewds a fuzzy wool thing that goes Baa?

XDDDDDD those memes

Thanks pewdz for this video

Wait how did I not hear about all the controversy over this 

now its a symbol of equalityepic.

Soon the color white will be a hate symbol

If the ok hand gesture has something to do with  w  p  why not meanwillpower

why are news people so dum why they belive

Hahaha love the jet set radio music 

i unironicallly use the ok gesture multiple times and is still using it till this day

When there is no problem, create one

Everything was fine and game till the boomers decided that its offensive

Beginning of the video: MusicMe: N O S T A L G I A

hahahaahhahahah made you look lollololololololo!!!!!!!!!!
I thought it was the ok sign

Its time for the third impact

Dank memer is reallyLike...Dank memer:Want some Flesh?Piglin:YOU STOOPID<b>stabs</b>

Wow she said that he Flash the upside down okay sign which means white power which is ridiculous because it up because that would be an mb not a wp, and that actually stands for mhite bower, not white power. Silly dinguses

The human mind is amazing! for achieving iq in the negative zone, that is a scientific breakthrough

2021: the thumbs hand sign is racist

Bro can people take a fricking joke

what is the song playing at <a href="">4:52</a> ?

So anything fun is offensive and since when is Pepe offensive memes were made to bring joy into life not destroy it

I can&#39;t wait for the boomers to die so we can fix the world

Poope

This has so much to do with what&#39;s going on with the moderators of the animemes subreddit.They&#39;ve recently banned anyone who uses the word &quot;trap&quot; for really silly reasons

biggest click bait?
My whole school likes to troll and do the ok symbol LIKE 48 TIMES A DAY

John Cena after the ok symbol is declared a hate symbol: <b>sweats profusely</b>

A, fuck i was wrong

<b>Ah shit, here we go again.</b>

NO. Not the bro fist!

No disrespect. But what the Frick? No Dark humor these days?

You know... in my place, the &quot;haha i got you&quot; joke we used instead of the ok sign, we used the italian hand sign where all the fingers go above the palm

Give us back our pepe frog and all our memes. &gt;:(

I will save the pepe.

These people (those people who says that this friendly nohing symbol is bad) is literally getting money by demonitizing the community

well uh it’s 2020 now and this is in my recommendations, but people are taking our memes, can old and overly white people stop using the internet? ty

Me: thinking haha spam =funnyPewds: reads my mindMe :o

o o f<b>c l i c k b a i t</b>
sooo. no more bro fist? saad dude

me: :ok hand:friend: dude wtfalso me: <b>*Visible confusion*</b>

So any meme is considerd a hate symbol

Of course the OK sign means White Supremacy, WHY NOT?

Hey that’s CNN they think everything is a hate symbol.

I hate twitter.

Why is That everything funny is ruined by politics

Who actually takes the adl seriously?

Nice dig dug music
Swedish blonde peter parker with a slight beard is his nickname for me

You should make more content like this I really enjoyed it

clickbate

This is what happens when memes reach main stream

i swear any hand signal is a hate symbol isnt the OK symbol for italians when they say the meal is good?next thumbsup is gonna be a hate symbol and pointing is a hate symbol  Having 5 fingers out a hate symbol Making a fist a hate symbol This is the Media in a Decade

Okay the media shouldnt be allowed to use the word Racist anymore.

more people should watch this make pewds a mediator that balances the internet events

That is disrespectful to Ian

Jesus Christ for a generation that half of us grew up in MW2 lobbies we sure r sensitive

Thats why we hate Riot

Next move: making a butterfly with your hands now means you eat couches.

rip

If your mad get over yourself.
Lesson of the day kids, people are unbearably stupid

We need more videos like this one Felix, that was cool...

&quot;Anything can offend you if you look for it&quot;

&quot; PePe is apparently a white supremacist apparently &quot;&quot; This is America nowadays, 🇺🇸 &quot;

Son: Dad what is this?Dad: Just the most interesting documentary about memes ever

Ugh why did they have to make everything a hate symbol bro fist OK and even high five are now &quot;symbols of hatred that are unexeptable in humane sesiaty&quot; its not right just unfair

The thumb of one race. 

Not surprising anymore. Aunt Jemima is gone too.

Felix should do a thing we’re he gets every 106 m subs to Unsub so he has no subs. Then YouTube will see and everybody will be freaking out and then get them to go back and sub again title be really 

Black power is coming soon 

this is exactly like the n word. you can call a white guy &quot;nigga&quot; but you&#39;ll still get acussed of being racist lol.

This is why everyone hates news

soooo every scuba diver is a racist/hater, lol.

lol it&#39;s so surreal to see my local news channel on pewdiepie

R.I.P pepe

the OK thign is 9 in sign language

shut up people today are stupid alright stupid its just humans fault pewds is right

means okay
God, the fact that people are still calling Pewds a white supremacist makes me so damn mad.

GOD BOOMERS PLEASE STOP

Dude pewdiepie used the okay sign C A N C E L L E D

West world  fucking weird

I always found that the ok symbol should just be a way to say well played the reason why i think thats what it was used for is just because you catch someone lookin at it then u punch em in the shoulder

apu apustaja is not pepe

Is that jetset radio in the background

 chill people its alright

nothing is a hate symbol except coppa (idk i just hate coppa)

Click bait
That it I officially give up on earth

You know how these “power” signs are from Karans

WTF IS THIS WORLD COME TOthe ok sign is now meaning you are a white supermenist even thought it was originally meaning ok, now we can&#39;t use it when we say ok boomerWHAT IS THIS

 haha gotem
I can&#39;t wait for breathing to be declared a hate crime.

A definitely A

&quot;Was quickly traced back to 4chan&quot;Me:

Bruh my mom needs to see this

B

anyone associated with the president: does somethingfake news media: omg racist symbol, trump is a racist, Biden 2020.this is literally how long it takes for media to blame trump.

This is why I like being a texan not an american but a texan btw for you preds I&#39;ve moved from texas

<a href="">3:16</a>, up and to the left of trump

i think it would be funny if the guy in the costume turned out to be an African America

N

Well, it seams like the whole history of civilizationWasn’t wasted on government bastards.

Why the LOTR huh?

Pewds leader of our memes, shall resurrect the powerful spirit of Pepe

this is so educational tbh i want pewds to make more videos like this

Thanks pewdiepie this was most definitely needed

ccccccccccclllllllllliiiiiiiiicccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk            bbbbbaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttt
How stupid are people these days ._. ?

This is why we can’t have nice things

I genuinely thought that this was a dumb analasys channel until I heard his voice

&quot;The ADL tried to help&quot; I&#39;m really sorry you have to speak like this just because you&#39;re popular. One day we will break the duress.

HAHA EUGENE GU he is literally  commentin on every single one of trumps post fucking meme

THE MEDIA IS A KAREN

Come on man I can use this symbol

The white power sign stands for 666

Make more pls

You can&#39;t stop me 
I like how this is all stems from AMERICA ‍️

Imagine trying to tell someone your okay  but then all of a sudden someone comes out and punches the shit out of you

This is bloody disgusting my friends suffered so much because of that i made you look crap

The whole ok hand being a hate symbol sounds like a bad comeback for someone who just lost the circle game.

not gonna lie one of my favourite vids

<b>Long live Pepe</b>

The media is like a karen, you do something, and they say that its offensive

<b>anger</b> in this video he used the universal hate symbol known throughout the galaxy as hate 

I used the ok sign  just as a circle bait or actually like a flashy thing, a goldy thing, valuable things, like &quot;this is the finest of the finest(but mostly I do it sarcastically)&quot;. For me = so I always perceive it as that

I have officialy been clickbaited (no hate)

wait but I&#39;m Mexican so that means it&#39;s  ok?
Bro I&#39;m coming to school doing ok

Pewds should do an actual Netflix documentary series, fr

You know you messed up when PewDiePie says something about this problem.

Pepe is a white nationalist symbol... ok lol

 this is not a god dam White power sign its just a fucking ok sing!!!

wait what haha hold onapologies for my ignorance, I don&#39;t live in america, but since fucking when the ok symbol is a hate symbol... what in the world??never heard of that one before

Geez people are sensitive now huh
Best psa

I hate this country

Deep thoughts with PewDiePie

OMFG

I blame american for making brofist hate symbol. Gosh american had enough

<a href="">9:02</a> That face looks like someone who would believe any obvious garbage thrown at her.

Bad times creat strong men and strong men create good times and good times create weak men and weak men create bad times

And all pepole who cant talk cant tell they ok

Why is the USA so dumb omfg xD

Everything nowadays is hate symbols

Person: <b>*turns the bro fist into a hate symbol*</b>Me: Why are u gay?

Love the soundtrack from jet set radio. Also, i hate the news, they&#39;ve manipulated so many people, some of those people are my friends sadly.. :(

is never  going to go by

is never  going to go by

as a normal person, this triggers me A LOT.

He did the double shoulder shrug

It’s the Karen’s man

Man, humans are dumb sometimes.

what&#39;s the music from <a href="">4:48</a> - <a href="">5:57</a> ??

Pew die pie do other documentaries this was amazing

Honestly I think this video well showcases how media loves reporting and exaggerating things they don’t understand

WHY DOES THE MEDIA HAVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING

wait a frog is what now

i had my computer wallpaper as pepe the frog not a variation of pepe just pepe and she got made so im going to send this to her

I cant see why the Okay symbol is bad, its used as a international symbol by divers to ask &#39;Are you Okay?&#39; and the same symbol is used to answer &#39;I am Okay&#39;. The fact they made it a hate symbol even after it was confirmed to be a fake WP movement is seriously dumb.

Are people this dumb??? Humanities respect= -10000000000

The feminist fist (aka black power fist) has become a favorite sign of white supremacists.......sucks huh?

<a href="">4:45</a> and <a href="">0:25</a> what are these songs

I agree with pewds its retarded how people ruin innocent memes and jokes and then the offensive people and the sensitive people both perpetuate it until it is cancelled. Everyone should get their facts right and stop being sensitive or offensive about dumb shit.

 <b>PUNCHES YOU</b>
Man you can&#39;t do any hand signs anymore

I hate whoever thought the (O.K.) symbol is hate. It clearly stands for &quot;gottem&quot;

Media: both white people and terrorists drink water....Also media: Coincidence? I THINK NOT!

I live in Illinois and my dads friend is the attorney that represents the guy that made the OK Sign at the cubs game and he got banned for life from wriggled field. Idk if they called it back or not.

ok boomer
rick rolling : okok hand : OMG SO BADDD

the ok meme will live on forever and i do it 10 times a day atleast

Even black kids at my school do the ok sign 

Boomer: this is bad The internet:ok boomer

Man what did do wrong...

everything’s hateful, and i wouldnt be surprised if “bless you” became a sentence of hate

Boomers sayin that u cant have fun

This video hasn’t been demonetised wow

my question is when the heck did doing the middle finger get declared rude

nice pirates f the caribbean scene

ha gotchu
Hey hey you  gottem
This is so sad Alexa play despacito

<a href="">6:04</a> he look like pewd from 2016

This kind of thing is one of the great filters that we human must face before we can ascent to the next stage of civilization but it seems like we have failed to overcome this simple great filter. Humanity will eventually extinct.

If Pepe is a white nationalist symbol, then the hammer is a symbol of socialism and you’re a communist if you use one.

What did this have to do with the bro fist tho

When are you doing subnatica

Well I thought the title was real but ok

Hi.

they took the ok sign out of modern warfare

I use all of these so I don&#39;t care lmao

Persona 5? Pls like so we can make it to the top!

omg gru is a white supremacist confirmed

Wow, people r literal idiots. Seriously, who is the idiot who was so desperate for attention that he made the ok symbol not ok? Like, give someone 5 years to get attention, and one idiot made ok bad. Thats as stupid as Adventure saying mrbeast is rude and horrible.

Seems this video got recommended to a lot of people again for some reason. It&#39;s weird seeing people attributing fake outrage to boomers nowadays (by that I mean this year) it used to be them attributing it to millennials

well, time to ban minions ._.             they have a white master and that promotes white supremacy!! smh

OK    IS      OK

It&#39;s bullshit why do leftist want to make everything and everyone who disagres with them seem racist, sexist or any form of prejudice if any thing they are making it worst

Since my mom is deaf i have to do  As Ok

Instead of using ur your hand like    \ |/               Just do    \\\        now it isn’t a w or p                                                               O                                      O

Watched this in 2020... thought it was new.

W   P

I have never seen the government act so childish before. This is crazy

This documentary of a video made me question the whole foundation of humanity

My dad:what is your wisdomMe:my wisdom is beyond your understanding

I mean Pepe is alive again for me

PewDiePie u just maked the wp sign in <a href="">9:07</a>. And wp stands for well played so when u game and a round is about too be finished. All players is writing wp..... Lol

Brofist should be The love symble

I dont want to be rude, but we can all agree that some people are really fucking dumb, and thepy will say or do anything to get some internet points or just get recognized.

What in white shirt is this!

TECHNOPEPE

I forgot this was a Pewdiepie video and was literally surprised when pewds came in and sat down

Is this just r/woooosh?

this means war to normies

Hahaha diamond sword go brrrrr
my friend thinks it is pronounced peep

The internet is scary because idiots have access to more idiots

Am i big pp
Gods, do I hate people sometimes. Some of y’all make it hard not too.

Uhhhhhhhhh am I safe?
I hate everyone so much about the whites power thing. It’s so retarded. But the circle game is cool tho. I don’t care, frick you. Imma still use it. Shut up.

When did Pewds become the voice of reason?

I remember when my friend told me the gotem sign was white power, I’m pretty sure I asked so many questions to my teacher, they thought I was going to join wp, lol

just 10 more seconds felix

Why nazis

I actually like clickbait now

Also This is where the riots begin

The guy in the white house is a trooper!!!

This is the secret reason on why he doesn’t do the brofist intro that much than he used to.

12

god people are so stupid

<b>pepe now</b>I rule this land!

ironically enough, the phrase&quot;subscribe to pewdiepie,&quot; is in itself becoming a bit of a so-called &quot;hate symbol&quot; phrase, with it being documented following the Mosque Massacre of New Zealand, the brutal Murder of Bianca Devins, and etc.

Anyone offends everyone nowadays

Love this style of content

this is the first pewdiepie video i watched and enjoyed in a long time

People will do anything to make trump look like the bad guy

Boomers are back at it again 

Good video but clickbait :(
Feels sad man
Society

this is ridiculous! its like saying jojo poses are tik tok poses and araki just copied them,

ARR YOU MAD NOW???
twitter is THE prime example of a left cestpool

Yo why does this sound like a trailer from a action movie

Bruh we got a emoji for this thing  they really think this is a symbol for “white power”  no, just no, we ain’t doing that. That shit is for shits and giggles

A white nationalist with a Spanish name God bless

Soon living will also be a hate symbol

This is the magic of these things. A person who thinks pepe or the ok hand is racist or right wing, might as well be wearing a sign saying &quot;I believe whatever the media tells me&quot;&quot; Go forth with this wisdom. Avoid the people that believe this bs because they cannot be reasoned with.

did they legit blur the OK sign, what a bunch of literal boomers

The problem is the media is extremely left or extremely right. Most of the media is extremely left. The extreme left is the group that makes everything racist. Even though most people working there are white.

The world: WP=WhIte pOwEr aNd tHis is a HAtE CriMeMe a black guy: does it look like I give a diddly darn fuck? It’s a meme!!

hes talking like its the oldest anarchy srver on minecraft

12

its... just a memelike they hate memes??

Actually a b and c werent hate symbols. It was the background and text font.

This is just dumb. These are memes, not racist signals.

= PEWDIEPIE=
Bowl haircut I’m going all in!<b>Shit</b>

We live in a society ruled by people who can&#39;t even keep up with their own country

When he said its a dog whistle i started trying to whistle.

Ignore my name

i swear to god the news is just filled with boomers

Nice shirt.

<a href="">3:20</a> I started shouting stop when she started saying &quot;BuT lOoK At ThE InTern He MakE StRaNgE Symbol Oooo bad BaD bAD No nO&quot;

I hate when this stuff happens.. It&#39;s just ridiculous like why should this happen..

UPSIDE DOWN HAND GESTURE!? BISH WHAT THE HELL HAVE U BEEN SMOKING?IF I SMILED UPSIDE DOWN AM I FROWNING OR JUST SMILING UPSIDE DOWN? SOME PEOPLE JUST WANNA FIND THE HATE IN THINGS, AND THOSE SAME PEOPLE WANNA WATCH THE WORLD BURN.

Why is everyone complaining about everything. I hate people.

Shows how hateful people are, why not make it world peace (wp) it still works , so why not

I got clickbaited by my master

how are people this stupid at least the ok hand isn&#39;t dead

Wait a minute pends ain’t internet historian
You cant do anything without media

12

So basicallyPepe and OK signAre cancelled

Why cant adults stop being boomers?

Me: <b>puts up a ok sign</b>The entire fucking USA: YOU HAVE COMMITED A HATE CRIME

Well this is kind of out of control people are getting tracked down for hand symbols 

Soon EVERYTHING is a hate symbol

MEME LORDS AND MEMERS!  ITS TIME FOR WAR PROTECT THE MEMES REVIVE THE DEAD AND FIGHT THE ANTI MEMES!!!

I was watching Happy Tree FriendsThen Petunia pulled a fast one on me

Okay so the morally wrong Marxist black power fist is okay but the brofist ain’t.

Me and everyone in my friend group use the ok hand as a signal of friendship            .

Peppa the frog

brofist is a hate symbol

I swear the boomers are just trying to say everything that everybody likes is a “hate crime”

Typical CNN

Not 10 minutes so no ads 
This video is a freaking meme documentary

In rhis video we see the government being boomers in their natural habitat

Ok hand sign     

ƒ
i&#39;m sorry a white supremacist did a thumbs-up? that&#39;s racist now.

Why is pinching offensive(I know it&#39;s the ok sign not pinching but just look  you basically see no difference.)

Please make more videos like this one, i would appreciate it

Why was this recommended from 8 months ago lol like if ya see this

i’m pretty sure that the original ok hand is 9 in asl because that’s how you make it.

YOU CLICKBAITED US ALL

This ladies and gentlemen this is the start of Twitter kpop stans cancelling everything or everyone that did one bad thing years ago

This idea that the ok sign is a hate symbol is honestly so fucking stupid

ive lost faith in humanity

better censor <a href="">7:20</a> before wall street journal picks that up...

Amazibg that PewDiePie did better coverage and had a better take of this than most MSM outlets &amp; politicians.

pewdiepie is the one whos racist

Ok signs is white power symbolMeanwhile trump: 

This didn&#39;t sound like a pewds video

The swastika came from Hindu India, and was taken in a bad way, by people who can&#39;t understand.

We are killing ourself

Felix is speaking more truthful words than my math teacher

Memes: ExsistThe news: ITs funNy s0 iT mUsT bE r4CisT

wat dis is clickbait  BROFIST is not hate

<b>pepe was dank memer on discord.</b>
“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.” ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Isn’t this basically just some old people that can’t take jokes especially dark humor?

America not smart country

Man old people are stupid

Where is the bro fist on the thumbnail was this clickbait

soooo... how is the brofist a hate symbol again??

We must stand in front of and stop it

People ruin good things just because there stupid

this is clickbait, he didnt mention that the brofist was a hate symbol

Dutch from red dead redemption was right “when he’s gone, they’ll just find another monster”

Thats crazy

I love that the media believed a rumor from 4 Chan, the most racist social media.

bruh where&#39;s the &quot;brofist is no a hate symbol&quot; part

I mean good video and all but it was kinda clickbait

Funny cause I said all three of them 

when you become a hate symbol

<a href="">3:37</a> ikr
Now all we need are people getting mad at the DBS Broly movie for using the ok symbol.

0;18 the bolw cut

Literally try and sit like that girl and stuff it feel so nice honestly just resting your hand in that position feels amazing xD

I never call people boomers because I hate saying that, but holy shit news reporters are <b>BOOMERS</b> (and they&#39;re retarded)

The amount of stupids that took the bait from 4chan is ridiculous

pepe alive forever

I don’t think the ok hand will truly change meaning. It’s been around for years and years and I just feel like it’s far too widespread.I mean I there’s an emoji of it . There might be some media companies or Karen’s that freak out to spread fear and get clicks but society has used it for as long as I can remember and I don’t think some trolls on 4chan are going to single-handedly change that. (At least I hope so)

People are dying everywhere. Children are starving and retarded leftist are getting offended over a ok hand gesture.

Wheres the tittle

The media can&#39;t have fun

They blurred the ok sign 

Never thought the government would kill memes more than the Pewds himself

PepeHands

guys look, I&#39;m racist. 
 mb  :/
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Not gonna lie, he clickbaited us with the brofist hate symbol

There obviously on black tar heroine

For ever one that uses racism as a Way to get more clicks on your news channel here’s a big fat  boomer

this will be a peace sign

Damn i.hate the internet sometimes

now that i like

So, ummmmIf they ban the ok symbol then why don&#39;t they ban the middle finger, if they ban the middle finger then the should ban the black people saying the n word ( that was not to upset people because I dont know what to called them)

is pewdiepie the new ben shapiro?

Pewdiepie:Bro FIST is USED AS HATE?!Video:Bro fist, and peepa Everyone:Click bait

Pewds without glasses: epic gamerPewds with glasses:  intliject

just turn it around the wp is now pw no offensiveness

the editing on this is so good b r o

DAMN

I like this new commentary format                                                        Incredible job!

what annoys me is that some of the people that were\ doing the &quot;wHiTe pOwEr&quot; sign clearly weren&#39;t even white lol

Flup your phone.            upside downNever gunna give you up never gunna let you down and desert youHahahahahahaha hahaahahhahahahahhah

Ah yes, <b>this</b> is humanity.Soon enough, breathing will be considered offensive.

Man seeing you from being a little teen turning to a busy adult is just-<b><i>w h o a</i></b>

As someone who does scuba diving, it is impossible to irradiate the ok sign. We use it ALL THE TIME. Also how amazing is this type of video? Just fantastic.

doctumentary people sometimes get u to click on the video making u think it happened but it is related to his or her death or his symbol but it&#39;s just like a totally diffrent topic of the title

SeriouslyNot everyone knows about this. My old English teacher did this. It’s even still an emoji 

I have a pop socket i its more confterpul to hold it in the ok sigh

i dont really like pepe

old people suck the fun out of it.

The white power ok sign is literally the sign for a all black fraternity

Yo good music choices!

the nazis swastik is faced to a different direction compared to the buddhism swastika. So that doesn&#39;t count

 I can&#39;t believe there is an emoji for this..

Some person: make the OK hand gestureThat group of people that make big deal out of things: wHiTE sUpRemESy

I don’t  you.
This is why news channels should not touch memes because they ruin it for everyone exept for Pepe i understand why it was being killed but it was funny while it was good

How about I do it and just pay no attention to anyone or anything related to it? I mean... you technically can&#39;t stop me. I&#39;m not going to spam it, but if I get caught in a video doing it and people mention it, I&#39;ll just ignore them.

Idea: Remove the media

Stop and think how many times this video got us

It’s funny cause In sign language you use the  as the letter f and number 7 i believe

My mom once grounded me foor doing the  when i said ok ):

It&#39;s nothing but a bunch of boomers that don&#39;t know what the heck there talking about

The U.S news media is major cringe

My mom won’t let me use  because she thinks it’s a white supremacy symbol

xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

The things we love it become a negative thing its so very dumb

I hate when people take everything on 4Chan seriously.

You no why this is the worst year ever cause 1. Covid 2.the stupid people rioting against police, police are good things 3. And the a future reason that will probably come from the schools

And then peepo was born

I actually guessed all of them at the beginning of the video, thats fucking nuts

Why did I get chills watching this

The Internet needs a self destruct button

The news media should be really restricted in which they can say or not. Sounds bad but they are always causing trouble.

Are people this stupid Because this is just stupid

Very sad times....

Bro nice jet set radio music
unlucky gg well played libtards
So yo do have legs? <a href="">6:01</a>

I know this is way too late to post this and that alot of ppl have said this but how is teh brofist a hate symbol?

I believe that there&#39;s a time when human existence is considered as a hate symbol

Me whos 12 : <i>confused screaming</i>

the upside down OK hand gesture actually stands for DW from pbs kids aurther

 if that meant white power they would not have made an emoji

Aight we need to ban boomers from the game.

This makes me glad i dont watch the news, use twitter, reddit, facebook, 4chan, and everything in betweenEdit: this is mostly due the the absolutely horrendous amount of storage on my phone

Welcome to EUA,a karen society that have stupid peoples,simps and boomers

The Video deserve this Oops it fellHaha got’em
Oops.

The ok sign spells W and P then don&#39;t put apart your fingers squeeze them together.
