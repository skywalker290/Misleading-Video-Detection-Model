I&#39;ve been listening to Alan Walker for years, who&#39;s still here in 2024

For the 1% that read this:Alan Walker is such a big motivation to me, he is one of the main reasons why I started producing music and I&#39;m hoping to be as successful as him one day, it would be my dream come true. If anyone sees this comment, may you live a life full of happiness and fulfillment, and may your family be blessed with the best. Wishing you only success and may your dreams come true aswell.

I remember when I was 6-8 years old, I heard this song on the radio, and I searched for this song for 4 years, and FOUND IT! This song gave me my childhood...❤

Thank you for filming this in Estonia!

I wonder if alan walker knows how many roblox games used his music lol

Alan has a Beautiful voice.

Nice video god ❤❤❤❤❤
Childhood memories, this song and GRRLS by aviva were my favourites, little me didn’t know the lyrics, but she was happy, being neglected by my parents gave me the opportunity to have access really early to internet.

To the person who is reading this in 3000 most of the person in the comments section are dead, me too. So, please don&#39;t let our legacy die, don&#39;t let this beautiful song die.

To the person who is reading this in 3000, i hope you are doing fine. I&#39;m dead now but i did enjoy my little beautiful life. So, please don&#39;t let this beautiful World mess up and enjoy your life. It&#39;s worth living it.

Welcome, pioneers of sound! I listen to it and it brings back so many memories 💥💥👏👏🥲
In 2016/17 I listened to this song because I liked it Today in 2024 I live this song

Don&#39;t let this song Fade away.

this shi brings back so many memories

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️😊

Song😢
just subscribe to this awesome singer <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a>

this song has a different meaning now 💯🍃💨

every time i listen to this song i feel happy even though it sounds so sad! 😭😭anyone else feel this way?

The video is perfect although sadly realistic... a reflection of this urban, desolate, cement world, of a dehumanized, cold society, full of loneliness for the young people of the city, yet so brave, adopted to this reality of desolation and still searching with perseverance and strength for her own truth, identity, ideals... also using digital and communications technology, leaving a message of camaraderie and freedom... the singer's sweet voice sets the emotional and feelings of the anima or female soul and the young man in the video the note of the animus or male soul which is always active in Jung's depth psychology...
At my mom old house 🏡 this reminds me of it

I faded so lost I faded

This song is my favorite

❤they are the best😎
Where it was filming guys?

This song every time I listen to it I will remember my daughter when I was 14 I heard her sing

LyricsYou were the shadow of my lightDid you feel usAnother startYou fade awayAfraid our aim is out of sightWanna see usAliveWhere are you nowWhere are you nowWhere are you nowWas it all in my fantasyWhere are you nowWere you only imaginaryWhere are you nowAtlantisUnder the seaUnder the seaWhere are you nowAnother dreamThe monsters running wild inside of meI&#39;m fadedI&#39;m fadedSo lostI&#39;m fadedI&#39;m fadedSo lostI&#39;m fadedThese shallow waters, never metWhat I neededI&#39;m letting goA deeper diveEternal silence of the seaI&#39;m breathingAliveWhere are you now Where are you nowUnder the brightBut faded lightsYou set my heart on fireWhere are you nowWhere are you nowWhere are you nowAtlantisUnder the seaUnder the seaWhere are you nowAnother dreamThe monsters running wild inside of meI&#39;m fadedI&#39;m fadedSo lostI&#39;m fadedI&#39;m fadedSo lostI&#39;m faded

Hello Read Goodbye I'm Not Less Lucky As Before First of all I don't see my body just going backwards Starting from the sentence It's not a big deal The simple thing of the Girl is stuffing her eyesight with each thing lying Unlimited Accuracy That Book In My Space Is A Demonstration Of The Lust For A Military Rank That Isn't Worth The Day Because Some Valuable Things At The Store Like The Instructions Of The House Outside Are Too Powerful Or Are You A Winner That Isn't Too Much It is clear from observing the movements of the number of people on the bus or a word of advice from this area that if we have ruined everything, it is no less than from words like things that all end during the day that we are a person. It's very easy for a guest who hasn't had a good time to complain that they don't feel properly dressed compared to other things. People who sit all day long just pretend like there's someone there or we'll be prepared for you, like that part of the hotel that can't be understood clearly. Because of the things I say on your behalf, the theory of the guy holding the hat if I don't see that job during the day or I let my part be lower and focus on what I know, arrange it again.
2024 be like 😅

I have some type of nostalgia with this song 😀
