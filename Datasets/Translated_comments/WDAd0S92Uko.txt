Who is here in 2024

Watching in 2024?

Why are you so pretty 

Sweetheart you need take your tears to god and he will your tears into smile

This song and this voice kills me! Wow

this song hits different a year after going through the worst breakup of my life 

Sounds like Adele 
It is Just amazing.

the seceret is in the chin

Was like a drug 

Right back here crying over the same guy 7 years later. Leaving a promise here to myself that I won&#39;t be this stupid again.

Where is the glass breaking and a bad ass bald guy handing out stunners?

A great song by a great singer with great voice 

I use to sing this song in the feels but now it represents my situation. I respect his decision, i dont accept it yet im trying to be happy for him, i always wanted him to be happy. But happiness is elsewhere and im stuck looking at my phone.

I feel this song today. I would overcome this pain.I will come out the strongest. Just wait and watch.

Demi is literally more talented then most of the main streamed artists, like Selena , a lot of ppl aside from Selena

Oh hell yeahhh <a href="">3:16</a>

WWE Stone Cold : - Hell yeah bitch 

Just right now, i really can feel the lyrics  &quot;i&#39;m happy for you&quot;

no one can sing this song as good as her.

Her  voice is amazing!!

omg what a vocals

I&#39;ve got a right to pray. Why are we dying? Preying. So as for the constitution?????

This album makes me sad! :(

It’s been 7 years and this song still hits like crazy

It had been a long time since I had really heard her voice, the one that makes her shine and show who she is inside. Magnificent song. 
This is the best version of demi i still cry if listen to this song

I ( JESUS CHINNA CHRIST ) DO NOT SENSE India ( Bharat ) , Europe ( Vatican ) , Usa ( America ) , THEY ARE CHEAPEST IN EVERYTHING . DO EMPTY SCIENCE ELECTRIC .IT IS WAS AND WILL NOT THINK OFF ABOVE THINKING .IT ( EAT ) IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE  .
She is so underrated! She is got a set of pipes on her!

Steve Austin
Songs hit different when you actually feels it

With each new drop, Demi Lovato consistently amazes us with her musical prowess, consistently presenting Authentic views as the crucible for unbridled talent, resonating throughout the rhythmic cultural terrain. It serves as the true epicenter where artists forge their paths to greatness. My girl skillfully harnessed its power.

Beautiful song
vocals!!!!!!!

melody would not feel the same, my point,

the only best cover of this song i heard was in the kids voice back then in 2016 by daneliya ...she sang the exact tbh ik that a creator is a creator but that child omg

OMG  I felt her expressions 
When there comes pain

with catastrophe and sudden rain

when you&#39;re crushed, being destroyed your trust

cheated by your beloved one

to you who was nothing but an angel swan,

It&#39;s better to be strong than being bitter to

as the person is your love and you were used to

so lets her fly rather you cry

and to move on, move on and move on...

This song is good,cuz Stone cold said So!

Girl I’m happy for YOU.  You sang the shit out that song.    <b>Sprinkle sprinkle snap snap</b> yassss

Its so sad that the only thing i saw about her that one day you have to call her they them one they she goes back to she and i never heard this melody intil now

Demi has got to be one of my favourite artists (if not the favourite) in the industry, I love her sooooooooo much, she puts all her heart in her songs and has really great songs not to mention her admirable strength, she went through a lot and still continues to be amazing and I love how genuine and sincere she is, how she’s opened about herself and doesn’t hide anything fearing that it might affect her career in a negative way unlike other celebrities who would have their PR teams covering things up for them, I’m not trying to diss those celebrities though, it’s not the easiest thing to be honest with a world that watches your every single move but I’m saying I love how Demi is brave to face the world and be true to herself no matter what

December 10, 2023 anyone??

Demi, this song is so bittersweet to me in a great way! You go, girl!

I think this song is about letting go

Man Demi is stunning  and her music is lit .!!

My comfort song
What talent  Beautiful!

Music is great with the family 
Coming here to say how much this song impacted me when I broke up with an ex who was my friend before everything and when he heard this song he was very sad because he knew that I wasn't happy with him even though he loved me very much. Today I really wanted to be able to tell him that I was very foolish to lose him but life went on for both of us.
I can really relate to this song and this helps me to move on, thanks Demi! &lt;3

Say what you may about Demi&#39;s struggles, but no one can deny the gifts this woman possesses.

Here I am listening to this song while my boyfriend is getting marries to another girl next week after dating for 5 years and I can&#39;t hold my tears

demi is the best singer i have ever known. I love this song so much. It contains one of the most genuine vocals.

I don&#39;t like this version. I prefer the live studio version she did in that black and white video

I have no idea why this song less views  she is really amazing 

2023?

It&#39;s touch in deep soul. She&#39;s perfect. Armazing

I thought when my relationship ended a few years ago this hit hard.  But it doesn&#39;t compare to the pain I feel listening to it and singing it about my mother who refuses to love me but loves and appreciates my little sister more than anything else in this world

Super strong signature voice and super touchy song

Vocals were good. Lyrics are stupid.

It’s not that serious. I get it. Life goes on. I knew this would happen. I don’t give a fuck. Money is a significant factor/component. I don’t give a fuck.

This song is underrated it hurts !!!

29/10/2023 
This girl gots pipes.. cant deny that...

Genius, what a voice
Don’t like it much. Too high.  Overly dramatic.  Not appealing to me &amp; others.

What I’m feeling right now . “If happy is her, I’m happy for you Ki. Hope you both happy together.”

This is honestly her best song yet. She really showcased her vocals, emotion, pitch and everything else into this!

Randomly remembered this song

Just wow

I thought this video was about the texas rattlesnake steve austin

This song is a soul-stirring journey through heartbreak. Demi Lovato&#39;s vocals are nothing short of stunning.

She&#39;s incredibly underrated!!! 

She would make the perfect Snowhite

Damn,this gives me chills……..

When my ex left me this is the song I screamed. Her music got me through a couple tough times in my life.

Me, 7 years into instant tears whenever I&#39;m hearing just one note of this song: I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re cring!

<b>This song emotionally breaks me to this day... what a freaking masterpiece.</b>

This song just...It feels like she ripped into my heart and said exactly how I still feel. 

Kariselle bodied this song…sorry Demi I kno it’s yours and all but

May cliff 2 have the same vibe
“I was your Amber but now she’s your shade of gold” she has always been talking about the abuse she wen through and it’s just now i understand, I felt this part so deep

One of her most underrated songs, period.

Don&#39;t pick on either, Wasn&#39;t me messed up my body, bastards demi.

i am in awe of her. she has a true instrument.

vomit 
From 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 to 🇺🇸 Rap music is my thing but u can&#39;t do nothing but respect Demi Lovato because she can sing

Never heard of this before, until today Excellent song ️

I came here for Stone Cold. Obviously I was disappointed @Austin <a href="">3:16</a>

Steve Austin, next music
&quot;if happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you&quot;

She’s one of the artists we’ll see in 100+ years in choir classes. Absolutely having full control over her voice will serve her well in the years to come

God her voice is just GOD. So underrated. 100%

I can feel so much of her in this video AND song

Mom was my friend
Yesssamen...right away go ahead..

Everybody listening??... 
We need  this  Demi back,,

wwe reference

The voice is wow

Sometimes, I think, celebrities lose in love simply because they can love fully where they are, but, their loved ones want something more focused on them. A homebody. The ones who can respect where each other is at and love them for who they are, succeed.

i was looking for steve austin but this will do

Her pale skin and dark hair against the snow is so beautiful

Stone Cold, stone cold You see me standing, But I'm dying on the floor Stone Cold, stone cold Maybe if I don't cry , I won't feel anymore Stone Cold, baby God knows I try to feel happy for you Know that I am, Even if I can't understand I'll take the pain Give me the truth Me and my heart, we'll make it through If happy is her, I'm happy for you Hmmm, Stone Cold, stone cold You're dancing with her, While I'm dancing with that girl While I'm starting at my phone Stone Cold, stone cold I was your amber, But now she's your shades of gold A golden ring on her finger Stone Cold, baby God knows I try to feel happy for you Know that I am, even if I can't understand Even if I don't understand it yet I'll take the pain I'm ready to be hurt Give me the truth Me and my heart, we'll make it through If we'll get through it happy is her, I'm happy for you Don't wanna be stone cold, stone I wish I could mend this, I wish we could be together again But here's my goodbye Oh I'm happy for youKnow that I am, even if I can't understandもIf happy is her, ×2If your happiness is that girl, I'm happy for you
Just wow!

Stone cold Steve Austin

Who’s still listening to this masterpiece 2023??

<a href="">0:43</a>

I loved it 
I need a lesson bro
It&#39;s Demis song but have you heard Anjeilica Hale sing it . Best cover of Demis song by far not taking fro Demi just blown away by Angelicas cover That&#39;s all. I bet If Demi hasn&#39;t already heard it , shed be proud of lil miss Hales version

And that&#39;s the bottom line, cos Stone Cold said so!

I&#39;ll sing a whole song it&#39;s so good I&#39;ll sing a part for you OK. So stone cold stone cold stone CO you see me standing by LA dying on the 3rd stone cold stone cold baby gunner. The God knows I try to be happy for you know that I am immediateven if I can understand.  And give me the pain no that I am even if I me and my heart make it

OK this is how you actually saw them by last comments pass it S. I&#39;m sorry but here we go one more time. Stone cold don&#39;t go you see me standing but I&#39;m dying on the flush stones called stone. God knows I try to feel happy for you know that I am.  Even if I can understand give me the blame give me the pain my heart will make i

Your song is so amazing that I cannot stop hearing it OK. I can even sing some for you. I did the last comment I did but I saw that wrong. So here you go stone cold stone cold you see me standing. But I&#39;m dying on the flush on cold stone cold. God knows. I&#39;m trying to feel happy for you know that I am.  Very fine you should understand I&#39;ll take the blame give me the pain me and my heart will make it through

This song is so amazing I cannot stop hearing it. I can really sing some for you right now OK? You see me standing but I&#39;m dying on the floor stone cold stone. Call baby baby God knows I&#39;m trying to feel happy for you know that I am.  Can understand

Stone Cold, love as solid as a rock, parting as cold as ice, heartbreak like a knife, breaking the embankment, sweet abandonment...Stone cold, stone cold. see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor knowingly weak strong smiling strong deteriorating crumbling stone cold, stone cold cold as ice maybe if I don't cry, I won&#39;t feel anymore Maybe the extravagant hope of tears turned into laughter in exchange for the despair of all hope Stone cold, baby my OPPA God knows I try to feelHappy for you In the dark, I am happy for you, in the destiny, I am dancing for you. Know that I am, even if ICan&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain knowing that I can't do it and doing it willingly without regrets Give me the truth, me and my heart #39;ll make it through steadfast love, always the same. If happy is her, I'm happy for you. If the bright moon doesn't face me but faces the ditch, then how can I be with it? Stone cold, stone cold You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone. You dance with light steps for him. I can't take my eyes off you and wait for your reply. Stone cold, stone cold. As cold as ice and as heart-warming as wood. I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold. I was once your gel-like gem. Once upon a time, he was your shadow. Stone cold, baby, my heart is still, but it's like a knife cutting my OPPA. Do you know? God knows I try to feelHappy for you I'm happy for you A moth flies into a flame without hesitation...I fell in love with you at first sight, Zamao's blog TAIWAN
one of my favorite

If happy is her I’m happy you. Goodbye my love and this one is forever

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

Still hearing this song ini 2023

I liked stone cold music very beautiful music Demi lovato is an excellent singer in my point of view kisses

Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel

Happy for you

Know that I am, even if I

Can&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain

Give me the truth, me and my heart

We&#39;ll make it through

If happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you

Stone cold, stone cold
You&#39;re dancing with her, while I&#39;m staring at my phone

Oh, I&#39;m happy for you

Know that I am, even if I

Can&#39;t understand
If happy is her

If happy is her

I&#39;m happy for you

Never heard of her, and after listening to a minute I know why, she’s a crybaby.

Singing this soon. Sometimes the pain breaks us, the beauty in music is that it heals soul in ways nothing else can

Who eles cried
Great music. Great job I really like everything. I will continue to support you

Amazing song 
DEMI LOVATO STONE COLD VEVO DEMI LOVATO

If girl says this, it means she truly love him, not selfish, but higher, agape, insane loveShe ready to sacrifice own plans, hopes for happiness this man

HER voice is so powerful wow,SHE is an amazing beautiful and talented WOMAN.

tem futuro

this song is really good
Wow! Wow! Wow! What an extraordinary voice, wow! And what about the lyrics...when I translated all the lyrics, into French, I had the song played again! And knowing what these words meant, in my language, French, first tears flowed, that's for sure, but lots of shivers ran through my body... (I live a long distance relationship with my friend, because he is a truck driver, working 70 hours a week, and I find it very hard, especially since it's the first long-distance relationship I'm experiencing, it's so hard not being able to hold on, the loved one, in our arms, Yet, it seems that it doesn't matter to him. With all the trials that God sows on our path, hell cannot be worse than that and never I wouldn't have thought that the human body could make us cry as much as that. REALLY, Demi, BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO. 20000000 ☆ OUT OF 5
Her voice just makes me feel so much.

very nice song. . . you are an extraordinary artist, I love you with all my heart
Although the years go by it will continue to give me chills
Wow...beautiful 
I saw a kid singing her song. Her voice was a bit deeper than hers but it was really like her. I was like “wow this kid is good.”

GABRIEL HENRIQUE  do Brasil !!!!!!  THE BEST <a href="">
After watching American idol

Man. She was so talented before she went crazy. This woman, female, girl, lady, gal, chick, went off her rocker.

When you just happen to fall for a girl with a man

This is such a beautiful song and her voice is  so awesome!

Demi Lovato I care about you I want to let you know I want to do 25 songs with you in the studio

i want to like it as many time as i watch and watch and watch and watch this video ...................

2023 and counting ️
Bah good
Do you know the pain? it hurts!
No grammy trophy? Really?

These vocale are epic!!  End of story

Perfect
I don&#39;t have that much but I want to brake bread with you and I want to give you some of my inventor money

art art art art
they / them ?

just love save

This so much speaks volumes to me!!!! I feel everyone and their comments! I had a 27 year relationship with a man and 5 children plus grandchildren. He chose himself and his selfish needs above us. Not okay! When my youngest child was 14 , he(the father) started screwing an 18 year old at his work. Devastating for us all! Truth is he truly scarred us all for life. Also truth is we have each other and he can roll the fuck on!! Actions prove it all! If anyone out there is in this situation… I got you!! Rise above and walk away and run from the narcissist!! Sharing love and inspiration to you all!!!!!!

If happy is her im happy for you ️

What?!

How come after 7 years I haven't healed yet? Is it the longing for my mother who left and he stayed and then left me? Is it true love? It's been 7 years, 5 without you and I couldn't get over it, why? Karma? There is no longer a life for the two of us together and my poor heart doesn't understand that Why do you insist on living in me? There are so many questions, dreams that didn't come true. May God have mercy on my soul and make me forget that love from 10 years ago I need to forget ooo God help me I can't go crazy ‍️
And that’s the bottom lineCause Demi Lovato said so

To: Demi Lovato, American Singer I am appalled by your recent blasphemous cover album. It openly dishonors Jesus Christ, mocks the crucifix and offends Christians worldwide! I demand that you immediately remove the album and stop its promotion and circulation. Sincerely,

This song is a good one. It reminds all of us that Christ Died for our sins. It is the truth. He Is our Savior. Thanks Demi.

A natural beauty

This is how I feel ryt now I though I found my loved one yet it was just a fairytale...I guess u never know wen u got the right 1 but what can we say it&#39;s life ...

This song is f**king underrated what a masterpiece 

Lovely Demi you have an amazing voice
Jesus Christ loves you too much so please turn to Him, repent and let Him guide you to peace

If happy is her I’m happy for you…. My ex had a double life for a whole year. I’m broken and he hasn’t apologized or said a damn word but I blocked him I have the worst anxiety can’t even work rn it’s so pathetic.

ive been practicing this song ever since i was in 2nd grade (now a freshman in college) and i can finally belt this song ️edit: okay not 2nd grade i keep thinking im like double digit age at 2nd grade 

STone COLD BAAAABY

This song has nothing to do with Stone Cold Steve Austin... I&#39;m disappointed haha

I come here from time to time, I don't think you read this, but, I love you...
2023 anyone???

Most beautiful music
I know she had to be special to be one of Simon&#39;s judges but, I never saw her perform and never heard her songs on radio/ media.       Today I heard a kid sing a song on YouTube The Voice called Stone Cold it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Soooo I looked up song and found Demi&#39;s video. You guessed it I thought she did a cover so I looked for original and was blown away. I had no idea this woman had such MAJESTIC TALENT.         I always admired her being an advocate for mental health now I&#39;m a fan of her voice and persona too. BTW the video was stunning.        I wish her greater success , respect, personal growth and joy.

Stone cold Steve Austin

~ i salute you of being a good singer performer....just keep on singin&#39; ...~ 

I just gave permission to the guy I love to find a new girl because he&#39;s tired of waiting for me. This hits like a brick to the heart

This song makes me feel calm

Woah
It's good to know that she turned things around in several aspects of her life, I've always identified with and like Demi
Omg this is amazing…it’s already one of my favourite songs 

OMG!!! She has a new fan!!!

Oh wow
Quality of Grammy has deteriorated in recent years Useless song are getting awards with useless lyrics which consists only slang words like PUSSY COCK etc etc. It is giving awards to artist like CARDI B whose lyrics are worst than ever

testicles
Still one of my favorite songs  Every time i listen to this i say &quot; i  love this amazing  voice  !! &quot;and what a beautiful lyrics!! it&#39;s just so touched  I love you so much Demi!!!Please keep singing 

I miss her..
this song is now my ally
Demi is a perfect single, i love she so much.

Wow!

She sings son well, because of the high notes, but her voice is so annoying - _-

What a vocal.....️️
I suggest you watch the cover of Morissette Amon of Stone Cold. It is a better version. You will be left in AWE!    

She nailed it 

I&#39;m not a huge Demi Lovato fan but this song is so beautiful and her vocals are great. You can almost feel her emotions listening to this.

I love you D! 
high notes higher than my grades fr

Demi should be a Grammy award winning artist. She certainly is worthy of it!!

I really like this song.
This was definitely about Selena leaving her for Taylor

Perfect 
STEVE AUSTIN STEVE AUSTIN!!!

Best cover from Daneliya Tuleshova!

How did the sound engineer manage to not be driven crazy ? How did he cope with theses vocal varations ?

This song was released in the year that a great love left me, it seemed like it was for me... It hurt so much that I didn't listen to it for 4 years and I listen to it again and a very painful film plays! If I met Demi I would think she made it for me 
when i hear stone cold i expect a steve austin to follow

Last year I cried a lot listening to this song
Coming back in the hopes we get music like this again someday

For 6 years this song has been giving me chills, it can't have such a powerful voice! I love You Demi
Damn!  I didn&#39;t know that Demi had all that sound and range! Nice. 

2022.. Still stone cold. I love this song so much. ️

You re enourmous strong
Missed this era &lt;/3 i remember listening to this 4 years ago, It was my favourite 

beautiful    dera
Listened it 5years ago and still hits same 

“That’s why you use autotune and I don’t” ‍️ That guy was just frustrated.
I&#39;ve watched/listened to this so many times and it never fails to amaze me how much talent you have.  Your voice is so raw and full of emotion.  It&#39;s like you bared your soul for everyone to see and it makes you so beautiful.  I&#39;m in awe of how great this performance is.

Everytime i listen to this song, it reminds me of the little boy in the elevator belting the F out of the song. The lower the elevator went, the higher and brighter his notes became.

cool

The Best tribute to this song... ever <a href="">

Bravooooooo
The RaptureFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.Deuteronomy 30:19 R.MWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

Hey it&#39;s me from 2022 :)

This isn&#39;t stone ColdThis is an ugly songI was expecting a stunner

the amber part didnt age well 

How I feel right now. .sad 

Have u seen the little girl Danelia from The Voice Ukraine singing this. She did AMAZING 

Stone cold Steve Austin

I&#39;ve known who Demi Lovato was for years but never listened to any of her songs.  I&#39;m an old guy, child of the 80&#39;s.  But color me impressed.  That was authentic and intense.

Man this song 

She controles her voice so well

My Demi....

Even if I don’t understand.If happy is her , I’m happy for you

i&#39;m  crying every time i listen.
Without a doubt, she has an incredible voice, it is a shame that people are only guided by personal dramas and do not listen to and value her wonderful voice, not to mention her lyrics.
6 years later

The Best

Marian Carey is 2 orders of magnitude better
Demi lovato vs ADELE Who will win the Grammys

I think this is her best song

Watching in 2022

7 years later first time watching this vid

I always liked this song. It&#39;s hard to believe this &quot;non binary&quot; person today, singing to ghosts and having a shaved head with a spider tattoo on her scalp is the same person.

2022?

2022?

You can see the real pain in her face in this video she put her all into this song and it shows

Listen to Daneliya Tuleshewa from Kazakhstan,  she performed this song in Voice kids Ukraine when she was 10 years old! 

wonderful music
