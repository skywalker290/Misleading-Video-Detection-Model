Kon kon ye song 2024 me sun raha he? ......

After so many days, I listened to this song again. As soon as the lyrics started, memories of how I used to sing along with it came flooding back. It was as if time had stood still, and everything from that time came rushing back to me. I&#39;m lost in my own thoughts now, thinking about how quickly time changes. But this song was a favorite at that time, and it&#39;s still a masterpiece.

you know I&#39;m an Islander not Indian and we grew up like all the Indians out there haha these were our childhood. The films will start trending and one CD will be borrowed from one neighbour to another and then to another until all the villagers have watched it. Us kids will starts learning the dances and before you know it that one neighbour built a dancing club for all the kids to dance. The club will be outside, starts at 6pm and every kid in the neighbour will be gathered and danced! oh such good memories! We will have a Rohit and Sabna leader to lead the kids LOL.  While every morning when we woke up for chores, neighbours will play them hits songs including this and buses will too. Indian films were a hit in our Island. Now it&#39;s 2024 and I&#39;m back to refresh the memories! :(

Indian songs are just a life philosophy ,you can enjoy it in childhood but feel and live it in the age of 35-40. This is due to our  culture ,teaching and mother tongue Hindi ,where we learnt the way of life from holy books to live
