I’d be the one to fist bump no.25, he saw an opportunity and fucking took it and considering his target, no.25 had some balls to make that move and i fully respect that

Is this funny?:<b>Yes</b>Is the guy who tackled the kid a dick?:<b>*YES*</b>

I love the fact there are morons who are clearly of the opinion it&#39;s real Here&#39;s a clue it&#39;s fake Nacy Drew&#39;s ️‍️The commentator says he&#39;s got a fricking Potato  for a Heart ️ 

<a href="">0:08</a> potato for a heart to a mash potato for a heart<a href="">0:39</a>. rip tommy #1

R.I.P Tommy

This may be fake but that tackle wasn’t

Both teams have come together to let him score a touchdownJohnny: fuck that, we&#39;ve almost made playoffs

Why did that person tackle that kid?

Well.... Everyone who laughed I&#39;ll see you in hell

Haven&#39;t laughed that hard in awhile, wow

Me: Gets a concussion and breaks my armMom: Oh! That is not good!

Poor kid

Born with a potato for a heart and people still dont get that its fake

I wonder how the parents of the kid who tackled feel in the crowd rn

I&#39;m gonna go to hell for laughing at this

Is this real?

Oh my God They killed Kenny

Is this real?

I think he died

I feel bad for laughing so hard.. This is pure internet gold

Guy that worked his entire life to do one thing : Let&#39;s give the Rookie a real AMERICAN style football experience !Gotta give it to him ... He was the only honest person on that field ...

Is this for real?

I think that child is died from tackle he is not moving

<a href="">0:45</a> lol the guy moving his hand towards timmy checking if he is still alive

The funny part Is where he gets tackled and kid waves his in his face like you good

They are so mean

Was this real? This seems to set up to be real but the reactions are so genuine.

Oh my God this is funny the way the other guys put their hands up like WTF man

Goldberg, Goldberg, Goldberg…oh wait, geez Goldberg, this is a grant a wish game, not wrestling.

Am I going to hell because I think this would be funnier if it wasn&#39;t a skit? Yes.

At least the the kid wont need a heart transplant

I hate that I laughed.

Savage

Dont worry its fake. You can tell by the tone of the announcer and that the tackle happens when hes in the middle of saying &quot;this is really one of those heartwarming moments in sports.&quot; Its comedy genius lmao.

Stop making jokes after the tackle his heart stopped playing  working

&quot;This is just one of those heart warming moments wher-&quot;𝙆𝙞𝙙 𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙨 𝙛𝙪𝙘𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙫𝙞𝙗𝙚 𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙙

The guy: schoolThe kid: me

did he die?

Denied

If anyone dosen&#39;t know this WAS a skit

where can i found the full wersion so i can see full reaction of the teams and coaches

Mad I didn&#39;t see this four years earlier

Little did we know that wasn&#39;t the football he dropped, that was the potato heart, which is why he didn&#39;t get up....

Am I the only one who felt bad for the kid?

A POTATO?

Is this real?

This is so fake. There aren&#39;t even 11 players on each &quot;team&quot; and they aren&#39;t lined up correctly. There isn&#39;t a single Referee anywhere in the video. Do any of you understand football? This might pass in Europe or to some Dufus in the US who is oblivious to football rules but in reality this is a joke video.

All the guys cheering for him <a href="">0:35</a> me <a href="">0:38</a>

Me and my friends having a normal conversation*That one weird friend;

Ese safety es mi ídolo alv



Lol someone didnt get the memo

HE KILLED HIM

HE DIDINT KNOW IT WAS A KOD

ur too nice i wouldve wrote &quot;potato fucking dies and football player dances on his body.&quot;

mans out here securing the ball while going for the body shot what a guy

When women want equal rights ...

IM THE JUGGERNAUT BITCH!!!!

It was heart warming until he tackled his heart out

When u use your ultimste sbility on a HP enemy.........

My mom thought this was real and boy was she pissed.

I hope people realize this is a comedy sketch

besides the facts. We really hope hes ok

What are both of the teams called

I’m still wondering if this is real or not

I’m dead 

Man is out cold after that

what a spear he hit on the kid from Roman Reigns!!!

The guy that tackled the kid has got to burn in hell. He didn&#39;t even regret it!

MY MAN DIED

That one kid recovering the fumball is the icing of the cake to this video.

Is that kid dead

&quot;tommy has lived most of his life in the hospital after being born <b>with a potato for a heart&quot;</b>

I’m glad this guy is dedicated to the game and if that means trucking a 9 year old make a wish kid then so be it

Who is watching in 2020

This video gets better and better as I watch it1. The celebration after the tackle is fantastic 2. Bro has the nerve to dive onto the fumble3. Potato for a heart

Gotta respect the tackle though nfl players dont tackle that well

<a href="">0:32</a> where the two players are holding hands cheering for him

When that one kid doesn’t get the memo

He got sent to the grave to quick

<a href="">0:30</a> Are they holding hands?!?!?! NANI

Who is here after looking up hard hits in football

This is emotional but he is a human so support that kid  he’s a king

JEZ

We all have that one dude who just doesn’t get the memo lmao

At the end he be like” what did I do wrong?”

What happend to the guy that tackled the kid lol 

I remember back when I was in kindergarten that when the craziest tackle for me was that we saw this firetruck and helicopter outside the fence at recess playing with a football! All the kids went bonkers and minutes later I was with my mean friend neal and a good friend Braxton! Neal was very rude to me and no doubt Braxton was good to all of his friends and all of the other kids who played with him but he was only on Neal&#39;s side everytime! So I went close up as the kids were getting more crazier as if they could escape school falling off another kids head to falling down to manage to escape it didn&#39;t happen but when kindergartners see a firetruck and helicopter together they&#39;ll go sugar! So I went close to see for myself! My old childhood is different then the one I had now everyone made fun of me! So I went closer as nervous as I my anxiety levels dropped neal and Braxton backed away from the group and I knew something was fishy! I tried to climb to see the helicopter and the firetruck! All of the sudden the group got worse! Some other kid came up to me and shoved me in to the group! And then I fell on my face and got thrown into the kids! I was stuck in some dark secret intrence where i was stuck with other kids being shoved around inside well at least I heard it coming from a distance in the intrence! I was being shoved and tackled on people&#39;s arms heads chest legs everywhere I was surrounded in pain! I&#39;ve never felt so dizzy in my entire life till then it felt like it&#39;s been hours and clearly I thought it was the end for me! Once more minutes had passed and my mouth was clearly bleeding and my shirt and my part of my pants where my kneecaps were teared! Once then I heard the football that we were playing with got shoved right out of the fence and exactly I finally heard it! The firetruck was going off and drove away! The helicopter flew away with the sound! The kids all ran where the helicopter was going because the firetruck just left! They all just ignored how I was yelling pain and feeling another kids body being thrown on the back of there neck! I was just clearly injured and couldn&#39;t walk that day! The football was at that point gone as I looked to see if it was okay to go get it to ask the teacher! That&#39;s all I remember on the first and worst but kind of fun tackle I had

Potato for a heart

Mamba mentality

You are right my guy

It’s funny but fake

And his name is John cena

What a dickhead

Uhhhhh why are sum of the players holding hands? 

At first I thought the red guy on the kid&#39;s team was doing the John Cena &quot;You can&#39;t see me&quot; at the end

Reading the comments, the amount of people not realizing this is fake honestly makes me scared for humanity&#39;s future.

Is this real 

Why would he even do that?

Yeah, that kis is dead

That&#39;s sad bruh

Get his reboot card

Oh fuck what happened!

<a href="">0:44</a> even his teammates were like “what the hell are you doing”

That is evil

That football player needs to be in jail after he did that. That poor kid almost died because of him.

The way the kid was laid out after 

I don&#39;t get the hate, the man just wanted to prove the disabled is able to take it just like us and walk... Well stretcher it off.

Nice catch el blanco niño, but you just got sackeeeeeeeeeed

So this is just stolen from latj? I’m confused literally just stolen content

is this fake

Fake

<a href="">0:36</a>

Bruh this whole video was stolen from LifeAccordingToJimmy

I see..... two opposite TEAMS holding hands.... don’t worry I support but whattttt

How do you get a million views for a repost where the original has 20m+

It seems fake because everyone will be mad at him and trying to jump him

Can someone prove to me it&#39;s fake ?

Rip for the smashed potato

You didn&#39;t see those guys holding hands did ya hehe

<a href="">0:40</a> : Substituion!  Blind Kid On!  vegetable out

This is just hilarious

That man just dove for that fumble

He went out he wanted I guess 

The lack of intelligence in these comments is appauling.What part of making fun of a kid with a disabilty is stated by a normal human being? disgusting people who cheered the kid getting hurt.

My friend showed me this and I needed oxygen

Poor make a wish kidThe person who tackled him just celebratesEdit:its wrong to laugh at this but I hope he is alright

Who&#39;s gonna tell his parents 1 2 3 not it

Is he dead

Wow

THAT STUPID MURDERED THAT KID ;-;

She was so mad at me for laughing that I had to wait until the next day to show her it was a joke... she said it&#39;s &quot;still not funny&quot;.  I DISAGREE HONEY!!!

He’s too dangerous to be left alive

That&#39;s just-that is not good 

Why would you make this and NOT put the original video link. There’s even their outro. I can’t believe you got that much views from a screen recording.

That guy is a d<a href="">#ck</a>

Look on the brightside.   Now he dosn’t need a heart transplant

did Lil bruh dirty

Born with a potato for a heart.  How sad!

i laugh so hard when I watch this video. . well i guess im going to hell XD

<i>___________________________________________________</i>

Am I the only one that saw the other guy, jump on the fumble?

This is screwed up.

When I&#39;m having a bad day I watch this video and it makes me lol

What I heard he&#39;s slithern watch out watch out JHON CENA!!!!!!!!(trumpets in backround)

obviously fake, you think the crowd would be that loud <b>at a little league game</b> and you can&#39;t hear the hit unless mic&#39;d up and if he was mic&#39;d why didn&#39;t we hear &quot;hut&quot;

In my opinion, the funniest part of this video is when after the potato heart kid gets Layed out(no pun intended) and fumbles, some kid on his team dives on the ball like 3 seconds later

omg that guy tackled a kid a the kid is 9 I am 9

did he die

is this real!?

That&#39;s so funny

A huge hit stick

that player sho I lo go to hell

SPEARRRRR!!!!!!

am i wrong for wanting this to b real?!

And then the kid falls on the fumble 

 look at his legs after he gets hit, so funny lmao

is he ok

He now has mashed potatoes for a heart.

This is fake u idiots it&#39;s says he was born with a potato as a heart

It&#39;s fake

Fake or not, great form tackle. And assuming it&#39;s fake, it was a well put together parody.

1: potato for a heart 2: is it OK that I laughed?

Copy wright

The boy that hurt him should be kick out of that game

Just lit that kid have fun and score a touchdown for his team ok that guy that hurt him

happy chrilser

Was this fake

fake or not - I peed myself and couldn&#39;t stop crying at the hilarity of this video.

Coach right after this:  Time out you, get to the rooms

GET REKKKKKKTTTTT!!!!!!!

I hate that person now

that Fricken idiot

lol this cracked me up

this video could have been funny. the guy who tackled the kid could have been another &quot;make a wish&quot; kids, just bigger. his wish was to fuck up another &quot;make a wish&quot; kid. and then gone from there. instead it was obvious and boring. gl in the future!

I was hoping this was real
