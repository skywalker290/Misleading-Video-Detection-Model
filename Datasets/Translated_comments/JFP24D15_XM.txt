What is so great about this..... Sikhs working for the British and Afghanistanis fighting for freedom or mother land against Britishers... Of course Sikhs had the advantage of the fort and Afghanistanis were on open ground... Its just fake hype and propaganda made by sanghis to spread hatred amoung Sikhs and Muslims... At the time Afghanistan, Pakistan was part of india... Are Sikhs patriots or Afghani...  ???

Your movies are powerful, well-paced, fun and energetic.Well done 👍

Andhbhakts should learn a lesson from this movie. Nowadays, Andhbhakts call Afghans their brothers, but the reality is that Afghans have historically attempted to invade India (Not once but many times) without any consideration for the divisions of Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh.

This movie is 100000 times better than Animal movie.

Akshay Kumar is a destitute human being, we are Muslim pashtoon in Russia, America and other allies with the help of ALLAH SUBHANA-WATALA and with the help of pashtun we have defeated everyone, destitute human being is Sikh, Hindu people who have taught the benefits of ALLAH SUBHANA-WATALA and their army.

The movie is nice but I want to tell everyone that the Muslima especially pathans are not like that as shown in the movie. Muslims are very respectful to women&#39;s amd Allah also advised Muslims to respect women in his Holy books .so according to me people the movie writers should change their  thoughts about Muslims because Muslims are one of most respectful religion ❤❤ Thanks❤

Hats off! One of the best Biopics !

Hats off to all freedom fighters ❤

Salute to their bravery. My heart goes with them. Really an inspiring story of bravery. Respect from neighbours

I didn't like this film based on a true, unreal and exaggerated story.

One side fights for won country against colonial British,  another collaborator fights for British. Punjabi (no matter hindu or muslim or shikh) are good servant of their British master. That&#39;s why they had highest number in British India army. But it&#39;s really shame that  they are still glorifying their service for British  through such movies.Happy independence day for India 😂😂

You people can make your stupid people happy as much as you want, but you people have made the futans here, it is only a few days that these futans will kill you people where they are killed.

Any actor like Akshay Paji can do any scene of a movie, he is perfect for everything 💞💯
There is a culture among Patthans whihc is called Bachaa baazi and its commonly practiced among Pakhtoons where they dress up small boys and make them do mujra later elder Pakhtoons satisfying their sexual pelasures with boys.  Bachaa Baazi is an integral part of pakhtuni culture and most pakhtuns practice this. 😄Its funny when Pakistanis brag about how brave pakhtuns are when infact half of their population was raped by Mongols and Turks.  99,9% of pashtuni womens went in beds with Central asian rulers and this is why Pashtuns call themself Khan because they regard Chinngis Khan their father.Penchode pakhtuni.

Superb trailer watch after 3 years....

The Best trailor i have seen till date.

watched the movie now, what a logical bullshit. 21 Sikhs fight to save a fort for the same brits who called them coward and slaves. Also, &quot;Mullah Saeed&quot; says that &quot;Allah is his tool for waging the war&quot; and thats what Akshay Kumar does, &quot;Use Sikh nationalism as a tool&quot; and that too to serve british

Jhooth pr bni gayi films ???
I was surprised at how much I loved this movie!

Like 1984 saheed sant Jarnail Singh Khalsa bhindrawla 😍😍😍😍
I hv watched this movie and loved this thoroughly... But can sum1 explain y soldier fighting for british r the gud guys and d muslim fighting against british r d bad guys... M nt trying to insult any caste or community... Everyone knows how respected and noble sikhs are...

Oh wait... You can shoot &#39;invaders&#39;..?That&#39;s good to know ☠️

My favorite movie

Very good filme military. Fact historic. Glory Índia. Great Power in the World. Congratulations friends. Brazil. West civilization.

Even today I would like to say that someone should compare Kesari's trailer with Pathaan's trailer because Pathaan is best then you ppl need treatment🎙️📢🇮🇳 coz termed Kesari used as bravery in Kesari and Kesari used as a besharam rang in second movie. 👍💥
If Sikh wre so brave why were they slaves of British empire?  The British tried 3 times to conquer and rule Afghanistan. But each time they were beaten. While British and Sikh Empire fought two Anglo-Sikh wars with the second ending the reign of Sikh Empire.

These people make stupid films to show the truth to their people, from Muslims to Pathans, they have spread their ass to the Chinese till now, they have spread their ass the same way. How to make a flim, those who blame China 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bollywood movies and Indian history full of fairytales 😅😅

Yes they were brave but they werent fighting for maa dharti or against invasion. Instead they were fighting for the british against the pashtuns. And actually it was pashtoons who were fighting against the invasion just like other indians were bck then.

Bahut vdya movie c
Is ko bolty hain movie

Next level trailer!!!!!

I fully understand why this battle is very important for history and there is no question these Sikh defenders were amazingly brave and courageous.My problem is with the film version of events which makes it into an aggrandizement of real events and embellishes that which does not need embellishment. Doing this through film, especially specifically how it is done in the film is borderline dishonoring of the historic Sikh soldiers in this event.It is also unfortunate but very clear that this film is also a clear attempt to dehumanize the Afghan enemies who, from their perspective were also doing their duty and serving their own religious views. I mean, they are portrayed as cartoon villains.

1🕉️
I feel both respect for them for their professionalism , but petty because they died as missionaries for a colonial power which enslaved their land &amp; people , against the freedom fighter ,who were fighting bravely against world strongest empire to guard their freedom , now I understand how 5000 English guys were able to enslave  10000 times larger Indian population , because people here celebrate killing freedom fighters &amp; serving colonial wars even after 75 years of so called freedom , enslaved minds &amp; souls cannot think freely .

Unfortunately, this movie is nothing more than an exaggeration.  Don&#39;t forget that in reality they are in the castle and fighting with modern British cannons and rifles and losing in the end, this is important.Proud to be Pathan 🙂

This definitely isn’t historically accurate. The Indians were slaughtered by the Afghans

It is based on a real story and it should have been filmed in a more realistic style, rather than a mythology. To that end, it is a little disappointing.

Would have been a better movie if they actually cared about realism

Lol this is a hilarious propaganda film which is undisputably proven to be based on a rewriting of history. The reality is those 21 soldiers were the invaders fighting natives but they were left to die by their slave master Brits and fought 1k people not 10k and they were destroyed in less than 6 hours.To cover up your failure you make such rubbish films to make yourself feel good 😂👍🏻

You have portrayed the real freedom fighters to be the villian. The freedom fighters who fought against the injustice of Britishers while you were fighting for them on top of that you made muslims to be the villian ?. When muslims have given thier blood more than silkhs and bhramins.its the sc and st&#39;s and muslims who fought for this land . Only us. Not you guys . The majority of you guys were busy riding on the Britishers lap. Fucking lies.

Im a 2nd generation Eritrean so I have no stake in this but I&#39;m all for this movie my god it looks amazing!

Kesari upload karo akshay kumar ki
This movie better than prithviraj

The real heroes were the Afghan tribesmen who fought against the British empire for freedom.Movies are made to glorify these sikhs who were serving the British 🤣🤣🤣

After vimal this shit hits different

Kesari movie like Akshay Kumar rrr freedom fighter ram charan
This was something we want in prithviraj

The first reflection was &quot; Kesari&quot; And now let's say something
This role came naturally to akki but prithviraj he did not suit, he should of done better preparation when playing the legendary king

It is only me or ur too like to watch it again and again 😁😁

After watching more than 10 times this movie, one more tym i came here to watch this trailer

Akshay Kumar raised everyone's eyebrows

We need films like this...

Still lost despite having sophisticated weapons like machine guns

I think I should start to watch Indian movies.

Ok

Tare miti m mil java wala song hota to or aacha hota
Sikhs were no joke, yes. But there was difference between sikhs and typical Pashtoon of the times. When young sikhs grown up in families well protected, north of India still produces vast quantities of rice wheat and other food sources while pashtoons lived and grown up in very unfavourable conditions most people were not interested in agriculture they prefer loot other wealthy neighbours. Plus Sikhism was great source of inspiration to north India their own faith didn’t borrow anything from others. Personaly I have respect for both cultures India and Afghanistan. I mean who we are after all a branch of great old pashtoon.

Speak saffron in your tongue 🤣🤣🤣
Today my tongue also turns saffron.
Does this movie have songs in between as other indian movies??

mouth also saffron

One son of twenty lakhs, where should I say the name of Guru Gobind Singh?
Ek onkar sat naam🚩🙏🕉️ Singhs are hind di chaddar! Sikh itself has originated in cruel Islamic invasion and to save hind people from Islamic tyrants.

The full movie just finished and the one with the orange turben I don&#39;t know but that movie was brave I 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏for that man that was still fighting he was one man fighting with so much man

So our Sikh and Pathan fought but on the will of English sarakar?

This story is not riginal

Orakzai Pathan win attack

The greatest movie I ever saw in theater it give me chill like no other

Akshay was great

Our family is Christian, with cultural origins spanning from Norway to Spain, and every nation between them. After 150 minutes of Kesari, with tears streaming down our faces, we were Sikh. It is the story of uncommon bravery, love, courage, sacrifice, triumph of the human spirit over enemies near and far, and living a life based on principles of righteous service to mankind. INCREDIBLE FILM. Phenomenal storytelling of an event and men that should never be forgotten.

Is this a joke? The Pashtuns are black indians but the Sikhs are light skinned? hahahahahaha Its usually the other way around. And the sikhs are speaking their ethnic language but the Pashtuns are not speaking theirs? hahahahahhahahaha Some nice hindu nationalist comedy coming out of india.

They were Sepoys working for British....Helping British to continue their evil rule in India....Why the hell Indians are feeling vey proud???

Too bad it's dubbed into Portuguese.
He dares don the sikh turban, yet is disrespects everything it stands for by shilling for the government against sikhs and farmers.

Finally, ajay favorite pan masala Dailogue has made two movies:-Zubaan:- vicky kaushalKesari:- Akshay kumar
These 21 guys fought in the service of British Empire who treated people of subcontinent with disrespect and humiliation. They starved , tortured and looted the people of subcontinent.

This movie is misleading and based on fake story. Everyone please report this movie and ban this everywhere on internet.Report as misleading.

India got their independent from <a href="">Britains.In</a> that battle afghan was fighting against British and those Siks was fighting for British .Than why indian people are appreciating them. isn&#39;t it funny.

It's okay, it's smart
The meaning is Ghazab's dhoghla pan.
This has to be one of the best films I’ve watched in a long time. Very honourable men who fought for their honour and in doing so honoured not just themselves or their families but for the Sikhs around the world today.Their journey was chosen and their destiny was a given as what they did was remarkable.

super super muvi
Today is SARAGRAHI DAY 🙏🙏🙏...

The film actually show the slavery of sikh nation, that how sikhs the ass of British army were fighting against pukhtoons to conquer the pukhtoon land for bloody British, Sikhs were equipped with the advance weapon while on other hand pukhtoons were bare handed to fight, actually the movie show the bravery of pukhtoon that they decided to not let British army in their land. Sorry to all sikh nation

Even Britishers in parliament also openly praise the bravery of those 21 soldiers. It&#39;s also said that history repeat itself. During 17th century 42 Sikhs of Guru Govind Singh fought with just 42 Sikhs against 1 million Mughals (Aurangzeb) period. That&#39;s war also called as &quot;Battle of Chamkor&#39;&quot; This movie based on &quot;Battle of Saragarhi&quot; and Border movie which released in years 1997 based on &quot;Battle of Longewala&quot; when 124 Indians with armoured Jeep fought against 2000 Pakistani with approx. 40 tanks.

This is how make your movie hit by using religion.

We don't watch India's log history, we just watch propaganda movies.
This is the special thing about India that only those people can make movies by changing the history but they cannot create any history themselves.

FUCK MORE THAN ONE RUSSIAN COMMENT ARE YOU NOT AWFUL?
Punjabi killed Afghan for the British in this war. Eerything they said hear is just lies to glorify their inhuman betrayal with this land and it&#39;s people. They faught for the British as sell sowrds, as slaves. They lived only for money and nothing else. They had fort, they had machine guns and bomobs. So they won against people with fonly swords. That was the history. The law of nature returned them it&#39;s justice in Amritsar. Where Ghurkha was used to kill them in their peaceful unarmed protest. British paid them for their loyalty to them and trechary to motherland.

Was based on real history of brave soldier I visited this place located in kpk district hangu Pakistan

The most amazing movie I have ever watched, courage and honor of Indian people.

It is strange that top forces of 50 countries (NATO) were defeated by a few Pathans in Afghanistan and here 21 Sikhs defeated 10000 Pathans. Now believe it. Akshay Kumar is so brave, so America should have him. Send Akshay Kumar and 2 lakh Sikhs to Afghanistan

This movie is based on islamophobi where&#39;s Indian Muslims....

It was Randeep Hooda who was chosen and who prepared devotedly for this role. But this prick Akshay snatched it very cleverly from him. Randeep would do justice to Kesari. Like Sushant, Randeep is an outsider for Bollywood. It&#39;s ironical that Bollywood kills the talented outsiders when they learn that only these outsiders are shining stars and the rest of the useless characters are not even worth a watch. Akshay needs to be arrested as well along with gay Jo for mentally tormenting SSR and the other talented actors. The old fart either retires or gets arrested. Arrested would be  better. <a href="">#302</a> for SSR and DISHA

i am big fan of kesari Akshay Kumar

Your father also did not learn from the pathos.
This movie also deserves national award 🥺🥺 even many more awards

altough this was a masterpiece but a similar film with the name &quot;The battle of Saragarhi&quot; was to be made with randeep hooda as the lead but the film was discontinued due to production issues for which randeep did 2 years of hardwork to get into the character of hawaldar ishar singh still think that randeep deserved this role more than akshay

here, exactly on their 3rd anniversary. 21st march, 2021.

Congratulations for 2 years of Kesari

This movie is 200% fake. God damn movie. This movie is a huge propaganda to glorify ISLAM!!! This movie has been promoted by Israel!!!

Spartans are nothing in the front of sikhs . Respect to sikhs 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

The afghan people were fighting for their country&#39;s freedom ..  but what were the  sikhs  fighting for? For England ???.. 🤔🤔😁😁😁😁

I&#39;m sorry as a afghan of my dear Indian people  becouse of what my people had done during the history I love hindistan and I will come there one day but I have to tell you they were wrong and a real muslim that who knows quran can&#39;t kill or attack to other religions

When the Sikh regiment was launched, it was confirmed. They are brave. We all are indebted to you for joining us. We are safe just because of you.
I had to come back and comment,  this movie is just great.

This movie was so interesting and brave and after i found out that this was a real story man i have no words on how to describe the bravery of the 21 soldiers and i also think that the characters that presented this from their point of view did an AMAZING! job i truly love it :D

Today is a black day and i get recommended

So, Goosebumps moments starting from here- <a href="">1:38</a>

Only Sikhs can show their support to bankers, now when Sikhs need to step forward, they are taking the step of traitors <a href="">#kisanektaunionzindabad</a>
So they supported britishers against their own brothers in land and culture. Afghanis were on the right side as they wanted to teach britishers a lesson for invading our lands. Why should we celebrate these Sikhs? Anyone who supported britishers was wrong, is still wrong and will always be wrong.

I hate sikhs!

It is a Masterpiece

I saw 「Kesari 」   really realized how powerful , amazing and interesting Indian movie are .    This movie brought me tremendous emotions because it was an action - packed movie in a vast , almost limitless land that can&#39;t be experienced in Japan with its small land area .    I admired the great nature of India and the vitality of the people living there .    India is a great and glorious country .     I am truly happy that Japan maintains friendship with India .May glory , prosperity and wealth be brought to great and effulgent India where we deeply love and respect and long for .From Tokyo of the Land of the Rising Sun 🇯🇵Even so ,the main character&#39;s magnificent beard is a work of great art .   I guess this is one of that aesthetics of India .No country can surpass India

Reminds me of 300

Jai Shri Ramji ,  Shri Chand JiPeriod : Born 1494    The founder of Udasin sect Acharya Shri Chand ji was born on the ninth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapad month in Samvat 1551 (Greogrian Calendar 1494) at Talvandi village near Lahore. These days, this place is known as Nankan Sahab. His father was Shri Guru Nanakdevji, the first guru of Sikhs and mother’s name was Sulakshna Devi. Shri Guru Nanak Dev had two sons Shri chand Ji and Lakshmidas. Shrichand was the elder son.Shri chand Ji, great son of great father was a great and a wonderful Sage. Since childhood he was very bright. After being initiated with the sacred thread at the right age, Shri chand ji was sent to Kashmir for studies where in a very short time he learnt all Vedas and Vedangs (the six subordinate branches of Vedas). After studying all the Shastras (religious books), he got consecrated by Swami Shri Avinashiram in Kashmir and while serving his guru he completed his spiritual studies. Then, at the right time, Shri chand Maharaj set out for tour and travelled all the pilgrimages from North India to South India and with his preaching created a new awareness in religious world.Shri chand Maharaj set out for tour and travelled all the pilgrimages from North India to South India and with his preaching created a new awareness in religious world.After this, once again he reached Kashmir and while living here, he wrote annotation on Vedas. After this, he moved towards Peshawar and Kabul. In those days, it had become difficult for Hindus to live in Kabul and Peshawar. Due to the atrocities of Muslims, people were in great trouble. While travelling in these regions, Shri chand protected Hindus at many places with his Yoga power. There is a monument of him at every place that he had protected Hindus. That time, Muslims were harassing Hindus in all possible ways in Sindh. The condition there in a place named Thattha was so bad that Hindus could not openly worship and the Arti (prayer) that they used to do in temples was done in fear and could not ring bells or blow conch shells. When Shri chand Maharaj came to know about this, he reached there and with his spiritual powers defeated the Muslim King there and got religious freedom for Hindus. One of the Muslims named Wazir Khan from Kabul was so impressed with his spiritual power that on being attracted with his preaching, he became a devotee of Shri Krishna and started singing “Hey Krishna Vishno Madhukaitabhare”. This way, he had also impressed Jahangir Badshah with his spiritual power.This way he exhibited many miracles for public interest and always worked for the protection of Hindu religion. Impressed with him, many people became his followers and his sect came to be known as Udasin Sampraday. He had followers everywhere from Himalayas to the Vindhya Mountains. A detailed description of the various incidences of his life and his divine preaching is found in books like “Shri chandra Prakash”, “Udasin dharm Ratnakar”, “Udasin Manjari” etc.He had followers everywhere from Himalayas to the Vindhya Mountains. A detailed description of the various incidences of his life and his divine preaching is found in books like “Shrichandra Prakash”, “Udasin dharm Ratnakar”, “Udasin Manjari” etc.Protecting the Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism) through the propaganda of Udasin Sampraday and taking it to the path of progress against all differing conditions, Acharya Shri chand lived on to this earth for 150 years. But with the great yoga power even at this age, he always looked like a young man. When the time for his departure came near, he went to the caves of Chamba and disappeared. That is why no one really knows the date of his death.Once, Shahjahan asked a question to the great mendicant Syed Miya Mir, “Just as I am the King of Hindustan, who is the King of spiritual world of mendicants?” Miya Mir had replied, “ Lord! There is only one King of the mendicants and that is Guru Nanak Dev’s son Shri Chand.”After Baba Shrichand, his disciples were great saints with spiritual powers who worked continuously for Sanatan Hindu Dharma and humanity 💞💕🚩🕉️💞🙏

Most goof

Hindus and Sikhs are close to each other.
Singh is king

You are a pig in the herd (Mullah) The lion is coming alone
Hindus are trying to turn Sikhs against Muslims because Sikhs are now mingling with Muslims.

&quot; Remember It was HINDU  People who wrote the GURU GRANTH SAHIB JI now days known as SIKH GURUS, It was HINDU people who started following the GURUS. They never thought about being a part of separate religion or race. Now people are trying to make it separate as they are grown in population and system is controlled by RELIGIOUS THUGS. Still 30% SIKHS in INDIA consider them as HINDUS. As they time is passing this %ge is getting decline. Before yr 1900 99% of SIKHS proudly call them HINDUS. SIKHS are considered similar to other HINDU CLANS like RAJPUTS, DOGRA, MARATHA etc.Sikhism was not a separate religion earlier, It was a PANTH, part of HINDU Practices  under the system of GURU &amp; DISCIPLE. All SIKH GURUS are HINDUS and Married and died as a HINDU. People never heard about ever that HINDU Converted to SIKH before 1845 since british came into power. British divided the society very smartly and made fool out of SIKHS.Now days many of SIKHS are denying their HINDU Identity because they believe what is being propagated on INTERNET and What is preached at their religious sites like GURUDWARA.Remember No TRUE GOD or TRUE GURU would have ever wanted to divide human beings into RELIGIONS. Its the people who created RELIGIONS and start calling them separate from other HUMAN BEINGS.&quot; ❣️🕉️🚩Ek omkar 💐💞🙏

On 21st of that year, 11 thousand of them, a single soldier of Chitradurga in 17th century of Karnataka had killed 10 thousand of Tipu Sultan's soldiers. That too, in the war that was in front of us in the land. You in the North understand that the people of the North have faced a big war, your sacrifices have been sacrificed and those in the South have understood that their sacrifices are worthless. , you have my own blood and you understand the southern people's tuchjte, you understand the southern people's blood and water. And fought with Israel in the 1st World War. The British had fought in the war riding on the Ashwadal God of Mysore and Karnataka. Only a handful of times God fought with only the sword and the spear and the last gun in front of him. Still Mysore of Karnataka was victorious in the war. Yea lion of Mysore. You are a SIKKH and yet the gun is gone.

Sikhs are not forever obedient to Hindus 🔱🚩❤️
If Muslims of India can decide and have their own land Sikhs can also decide and have their own land 🔱🚩❤️

In 1947 Nehru promised Sikhs for their Self Government 🔱🚩❤️

Sikhs want freedom 🔱🚩❤️
Jai khalistan freedom movement 🔱🚩❤️

Still Muslims can't change anything.

Boycutt Bollywood movie all time

Ye jhoot hai bc 21 vs 10000

Has taken the role of Randeep Hooda?
Why do I dislike it?
How come the afghans were dark skinned while the Indians were fair skinnedThose people were just britsh stooges i tought

India is busy in making jokes on Sikhs,while they busy coping hunger in gurdwara&#39;s,the punjab regiment ine of the oldest and the most decorated regiment of indian army.The legends Bhagat Singh,rajguru from Punjab.I know more and more about Sikhs

If there exist people who did not invade anybody instead protected Bharath maa from all invaders the credit goes to only the Hindus and the Sikhs jointly. The Sikhs always stood with India and indians

Why will you make the bus mad?

This film is wrong message for our country

Did the Englishmen hide their lips and then did the Pakhtons wear the Englishman's clothes?
Ayush chauhan
PTA, what is it that the public is useless like Kesari, like a truth movie or Tiger Zinda is like a Mangadant, a blockbuster.
In jang yarmok 40 Muslims fought against 40000 and won

Very good movie

Nice
This event happened in 1897And 48 years before this eventBritish East India Company defeated the Sikhs during the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, So the Brave Sikhs culd not protect there home land from the British raj and accepted defeat started  obeying  orders from British raj and started to show there loyalty  and bravery in killing people who were protecting there home land from the British raj and stayed loyal un till  the British were reluctant to leave India fearing  India would erupt into civil war between Muslims and Hindus. ... In 1947 the British withdrew from the area and it was partitioned into two independent countries - India (mostly Hindu) and Pakistan (mostly Muslim).and nothing for the Sikhs Very sad for all lives lost and taken in name of loyalty  what a shame One would say stupidity not bravery May the head bow in shame before it&#39;s raised in shamefull pride Peace and love to all

Jhoot

I proud to be a Sikh….I am a Sikh and I am proud of being a Sikh….Jo said sonahal sat sri akal…Waheguru ji's family is the father of waheguru ji….

All problems one reason buslims

Sikhs love Muslims and their way of living.  Sikhs name their children Muslim names. They don&#39;t even fully know the meaning of the name haha 😮😮😮😮😮

Bullshit 😂😂

If there are such movies, can you write their names, Indian movies?
Simple funda, not only leader but all the soldiers are able to give tough fight. This is only the reason they want.

Hey, if you don't want to learn anything, you will make stories.
Climax expose the real feeling, I mean real sacrifice ❤️.

respect 🙏

Shiko Mulo had killed the cows. ...wow
Hats  off man

These soldier must have been brave - but they where fighting for the &quot;British Raj&quot; who was trying to occupy another land using their help/subordination. I am glad the British lost and were defeated!

Pashtuns and Sikhs the nations that never bowed

21 Sikh soldiers defeat 10000 afghans
Dipesh Nepal 🌹🌹🌸🍦
I am so much in love with this soil that even after seeing Sanam's love, I could not turn back.
What brave fighters they were, with a saffron turban on their heads, they fought with 10 thousand Afghans, remember the unique story of Saragarhi, the story of 21 brave Sikh soldiers.

the irony is these Sikh were defending the British not their own &#39;Mitti&#39;. it was a great last stand however, my sympathy goes to the Afghans&#39;

Akshay Kumar&#39;s dialogue- &quot;Kesari rang ka matlab samajhte ho kya hai, bahaduri ka rang hai shaheedi ka&quot; mind blowing. Kesari film was the most superhit film. Unbelievable story 21 Sikhs vs 10,000. The most respectful thing is Sikh&#39;s turban👳👳👳👳👳👳. Salute to our brave soldiers

He is crazy who dials such films.
movie acca nehi laga
Toh bolo zuba kesari
Propaganda film......
But NCERT will never talk About it this,it only informs about  mughal invaders empire.

Afghans and Hindus are enemies from the beginning.
Fake story . The reality is 60 Afghans leaded by Abdali defeated 14000 Sikhs fighters .
