Yes, yes God pls mk it cm true.. RANBIR U STAY BACHELOR FOREVER.. GOOD FOR U PLAYBOY. DONT DESTROY ANOTHER LIFE.. STAY W MAMA.. K

Good news indeed,wish nvr happn at all

Murdered sushant and happily getting married

Why and Aliya
why girls r falling love with ranbir kapoor whats the unique thing in him....nothing he is still a playboy and always likes to play a new girls life...thats it...he&#39;ll never falling in love with anyone ever bcz of his habits...He dnt deserve pure love or pure one...

Ranveer has no quality of marriage i think nd alia may be she feel she will get a family to reduce her papa &#39;s &quot;kand&quot; bt she choose a boy like his papa...is that really make sence??

Take yor time being committed is not easy

Such a lie her age is 28

Better do 60&#39;s marriage
Ranbir was truly in love with katrina but he had to compromise to please his parents.  Let your children make their choices that they think would make them happy and if in the event things did not go right then be there to support them but allow them to make their mistakes only that way they can learn.  With all the disappointments in that relationship leading to marriage something definitely is saying something else.

Just it

Somehow I always sensed this. Why would she marry so early unless she wanted to follow the footsteps of the oye oye girl !

Not matching also

Next year another member will die 
What difference does it make whether they marry or not? The fun is too poor.
They should not get married at all

Who  cheat other s they have to face the cheaters

Aliya vatt is bed sprit because two brothers died so not at all .

That&#39;s the best news I have heard for a long time . Where the family muderers.

Ranbir is a playboy anyway

I think this marriage will never  happen  and any way I am tired of waiting Varun’s wedding happened so fast that I didn’t even realize unlike them

I am happy
Ooo it is good news

Boycott bollywood 
So happy 

Ranbir, you are perfect with Katrina, not Alia

Yeah toki happy
It’s extremely important to take great care of your body ( when you’re the girl- woman) you should not or never ever bargain yourself.. never live with no man unless you’re already married.. it’s like buy the cow if you can get the milk for free 

Why ppl spreading false rumors

Bikul thek faisla h alia se shadi na krne k good kat se krle ap plzzzz

I&#39;m so happy

<a href="">1:11</a>..whatvis happened to your &quot;there&quot;

No we are not waiting for their marriage..Don&#39;t marry Ranbir..

They are a gayyyyy

She is not going to marry with Ranbir  I think so

Wow I&#39;m so happy 

Uhh nooooo

Lol that interview was 2 years ago, she is 27 now not 25 anymore

But she is 27 or older  I guess.....Kuch bhi

Ranbir is being safe he thinks positive

What&#39;s the big deal.......There are so many prblms in our country it&#39;s not a big deal on these idiots 



I think alia or ranbir are cheating on each other or else it is true

Alia Ranbir marriage cancelle This is what has happened
Mahireddy it&#39;s their wish want do you want

Not interested alia

The only girl  in B town who is just white not beautiful.

Rambir  doesn’t really want to get married. It would interfere with his playboy status. Both he and Alia are making up excuses. Don’t care if they marry or not

kapoor family can&#39;t live with one....they need multiples

Not interested on alia

If I say something, Ranbir will not marry Alia before 2 years then there will be a breakup soon because everyone knows Ranbir is like neither he nor anyone else.
Good new

At <a href="">1:11</a> there was written as &#39;  tehre &#39;

I think they would  never  get married..Even if they married they will not long last...as rimbir a play boy...

Shaadi toa karni hie nhi h inko. That means this is only the publicity stunt for there new projects if don&#39;t do so there projects will be the epic flop in bollywood because of mahesh bhatt.

She is not 25

 so happy
They together so long it makes no diffrence

Ranbir and alia like here

Good news 

Shokcing Shocking is correct spelling

If they keep too long a fuse, it may turn into a damp squib !

Nautanki Alia
Not interested in this.  But just saw  this video... Both RK and AB are not good. They dumped their true partners for each other. Ranbir starting from Sonam , Deepika , Katrina and now Alia. Alia who was fond and dating sid Malhotra. Left him for this RK ... So if they marry this year or next year what happens to us.    .. its their personal life and marriage.

Alia need not to marry Ranbir. He is not the perfect match for u. So young u r to him.

I want to Mary alia

That&#39;s good just be friends

Who r they

Who cares about their marriage
