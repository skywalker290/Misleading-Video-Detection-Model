people are taking this so seriously . It&#39;s obviously meant to be taken as a joke, I don&#39;t think he expected anyone to believe this was real, because if they did it would not be funny. That&#39;s how comedy works. It&#39;s funny to say I&#39;ll hit you if you make it clear that you won&#39;t

Lmmfao

Dude with the Slomo really?? are you retarded

FAKE

Fake as fuck just like the Will Smith/Chris Rock deal

Chill, Billy

You don&#39;t talk at a comedy show. Hopefully this asshole went to jail and Paully pressed charges. I mean nobody goes to &quot;Hoss&#39;s&quot; work and throws rocks at him while he&#39;s cleaning the pens. Don&#39;t talk through someone&#39;s show.

So many losers always want their 5 seconds of fame by making themselves look like brain dead morons. If you don&#39;t like the show. Go home or somewhere else. How would you feel if someone came to your minimum wage job and heckled you?

Check out Pauly Shore&#39;s Random Rants of YouTube.

That is my uncle that punched him lol

For those swearing it was real, there&#39;s a video showing Pauly coaching this guy exactly what to do before this video was filmed. In front of this same audience. Pretty sure you can find it on YouTube as well.Second of all, every comedy venue in the world has security in place to stop this very thing from happening. The minute Bo Cephus got up on stage, he would have been swarmed by 2-3 bouncers. And if they didn&#39;t immediately show up, Pauly would have left the stage, not stick around for the punch.Finally, you can see through the replay that the punch didn&#39;t come even close to connecting.I still don&#39;t understand what Pauly&#39;s angle was in doing this. I don&#39;t see how it benefits him as a publicity stunt.

Wonder if he got hazzard pay.
With security like that, no wonder they believed JFK was shot by only one guy in Texas.

Y’all know this was staged right ?

fake.

It look like he was way late on that punch stupid fat boy hillbilly

Oh Brian

Ha hahahahaha.....HAAAAAAA hahahahahahahaha.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..(4 hours later)..HAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!!

Pauly&#39;s acting coach needs to remind him not to fall down before the fist is even remotely close to his head.  Wow.

Staged. Too bad it didn&#39;t happen for real.

lmao !!! Stfu Hoss !!!
I hope that piece of shit hick got charged.

&quot;Fucking Hoss&quot; lmao

Fake, punch never connected

I dated Pauly, this was staged, his bouncers are on top of this shit. Get real smh.

Staged

Staged thankfully. Would&#39;ve been ridiculous otherwise.

Is this the real Pauly Shore? If so are you coming to MB?

I Didn&#39;t See Any Bouncers that night.



staged, i was there. skit was done in Odessa Texas A Few Years ago at the 8th Street Comedy Club



Staged

redban edition? brian redband? powerful redban?

Comedy gold, buuuddy
you know next to nothing.   lets leave it at that.   again, this is not a &quot;fake&quot; video, it was part of his act that was edited by somebody to look real, and then someone called it fake.   Dumbass. 

This video is not &quot;fake&quot;.  It was part of his routine that night.  Its been edited so you don&#39;t see the part where hes practicing with &quot;hoss&quot;.    It was a pretty funny bit.  Hes gotten a lot funnier as he gets older.   

Well regardless, I want to see Bio-Dome 2: ON MOON!

I understand you were being sarcastic, and I agree that there are a bunch of people who would like to hit Pauly Shore, personally, I can&#39;t stand him.  What I am saying is that is irrelevant to Konrads post.  He is giving valid reasons to why he thinks the video is fake (it is in fact fake), whether or not someone would want to hit Pauly Shore was never in question.

WTF does that have to do with it being fake or real?

Yeah, right? Because no one hates Pauly Shore...

yes this is staged

there is actually another vid on youtube with the making of it 

I think that was staged.  The minute the guy got onstage, security should have been all over his ass.  Then the cop does a half-asses job ushering the hick off stage.  Not to mention it didn&#39;t even look like the punch landed.

hahah

Thanks Texas, you may have gave us Bush, but you injured Paulie shore... We&#39;re even now.

Hey Pauly, Remeber Ted, the big blonde  guy in Toronto where you wanted to squeeze his juice, and he told you to fuck-off because he thought you were ab irritating fuck....Remember! anyways he says hi, and after seeing that hill-billy Texan hit ya, Ted apologizes for being mean to you. You ARE somewhat irritating but you don&#39;t deserve that sort of treatment from ignorant people who just don&#39;t get you. Oh and maybe you shouldn&#39;t tell big boneheads to fucken shut up in the future...Just saying EH!

Way to go tex...

Ohh Brian.

Ha ha

Pauly shore is the man! fuck that hick

@holypoop88 like I give a shit... go beat off to it if you love him so much ... dumbass

@linglishboy It&#39;s fake - it was staged

THe ude got thrown out quickly by the security guard

That&#39;s the texan way, i love it. Vote Ron Paul 2012

naww that was real.... wow pauly has attitude!

You guys realize this was fake, right ??



Just youtube The Making Of Pauly Shore Gets Punched In The Face

Proven fake. Not exactly hard to prove, either, since the proof video comes up in the first set of suggestions when people watch THIS one.





that was the shittiest punch ever

Shut the fuck up, fucking hoss!

Fake! i was a set up.



This is real. I was the person in the back. You can see me right there, in the back. I knew both Pauly Shore and the cowboy personally; both Pauly Shore and the cowboy are my uncles, and my uncle got off with minimal charges because most states in the U.S. permit punching Pauly Shore; he was actually charged with public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Police immediately dropped the assault charges. The reason security didn&#39;t act for the hour or so they&#39;re arguing on stage is the same.

LMFAO &quot; shut the fuck up fuckin haus&quot;

@jayphill420 its fake,damn

this is fake dummies

Haha, stupid hick.  Hope you enjoyed your stay in jail.

first of pauly shore is the fucking man!!! and his movies are fucking awesome u dipshit hick!

@grantpon1480 fuck u hes the man

i want to punch pauly shor for making so many god awful movies

@TequilaAssassin4eva Wow. That just shows how pathetic Pauly Shore is. What a douchebag. No boost of career was accomplished; he just looks like a coward. I don&#39;t see how he figured this would get him in another trash movie. 

@TequilaAssassin4eva LOL! You think that Pauly Shore can afford security? If he had any money, he wouldn&#39;t be in some dark bar getting harassed by drunks and facing ultimate humiliation. 

Sux that this was probably fake.  Pauly Shore is a dickheaded asshole.

Pauly Shore&#39;s thug pussyguard sucker punched one of my acquaintances because they just wanted to say hi to him and invite him to a rock show at an underground club.  Fuck you Pauly, byatch!

Too bad this is fake because Pauly Shore is disgusting asshole.

Good Job Pauly, you fooled me. 

What&#39;s sad is that random guy is a better actor than he is.

@mastior Dear Dr Hate:  A 6th Grade Level=using &quot;should of&quot; instead of &quot;should have&quot;.  This is comedy and was set up.  I&#39;m not even a fan of Pauly Shore, but there&#39;s no reason to spread your hatred of Jews in the comments section of comedy video.  

Fake

republican ruffians.

That sound in the begining...where is the sound clip from? does anyone know?

FUCK!!! Here I was expecting to see the world&#39;s biggest mistake of all times get punched in the face and it&#39;s a fucking act. Did anyone ever hit this guy? He totally asked for it with all of his crap movies and unfunny acting. Please tell me someone inflicted fisical pain on him.

@squidney2k1 totally. Notice how the huge bouncer only shows up AFTER he&#39;s &quot;decked&quot; him.

Cracked.

@lavabrand you do reAlize this is all staged right

@DJRoadkill18seven Watch the making of video -&gt;

@aYsDigital there&#39;s a making of video right here on YT -&gt;

@DJRoadkill18seven check the video to the right entitled &quot; The making of Pauly Shore gets knocked out.&quot;

paulie shore hasen6t been funny since encino man...i used to be such a huge fan of his then i did a set at the comedy club(his parents own that) and i was getting WAY more laughs then he was and after the show he got up and did that &quot;give that unknown comic some love bs because im way more famous&quot; shit..also paulie your house partys blow...dildo fights dont=fun..yes actual 4ft long dildo fights...those fuckin hurt to be slapped with

i dont get why everyones saying this is fake, i just wanna know what the motive is to fake this, why would do all this just to make himself look more likea  doushebag

STAGED.

Pauly Shore has fans?

C&#39;mon Pauly, learn to see a punch coming when it&#39;s that obvious.

To all the people that hate Texas grow up. I&#39;m from Texas born and raised honey. Pauly is actually the rudest man I have ever known long story but still. He thinks he&#39;s better than everybody hell no wonder every girl dumped his has cause they had to put up with PMS HAHAHAHAHAHAHA LMAO XD

everyone who doesn&#39;t want to punch this fucker is an idiot. there are no exceptions.

YES, ik this isn&#39;t real but if you&#39;ve seen one of paulys movie&#39;s, you&#39;d know he deserved it for being an idiot.

it  was fake. search for it. he planned it.

I&#39;ve wanted to do that for years...Ever since his stupid Encino Man &quot;talk&quot;

NOT FAKE it was it the news NOT FAKE

he dodged that shit please..that was fake

FAKE

out of all the cartwrights why would you mess with hoss?

it was a set up look at the making of pauly shore gets knocked out

It was a setup; pre-planned by pauli Shore

watch?v=pZWURqqMqg0



Clueless idiots piss me off.

this sucks I love this dude! I smoked him out at the Gathering of the Juggalos 09!

He got a lot of people on this one thinking it was real. What&#39;s funny is that people STILL think it&#39;s real despite the videos showing them rehearsing.

lol that du haad hator-aide 4 Breakfast

pauly made this up, its fake lol. i just saw the making of it.

look to th right, in related videos. theres one showing the making of it. it is fake and also pretty pointless

Its fake look up The Making of Pauly Shore Gets Knocked Out. and pauly is good. everybody has different taste. lay off the bad comments

hey genius its staged....

he didn&#39;t even get hit for real
LOL poor ole Paulie.
Man I feel bad for comedians these days....



Why go to a comedy club, and fuckin interupt da fuckin comedian?

Encino Man would&#39;ve been hilarious if not for Sean Astin ruining the whole damn production.

You&#39;re an idiot.

To fuck up pauly shore... would&#39;nt you?

did this happen in texas?

I was actually at this show and yeah it was staged. i only wish it was real, because i paid 90 bucks for this show and my seat was touching the back wall. the 8th street comedy club is not like a theatre with riser seating, so from the back you can&#39;t see a damn thing. all pauly did was make references to movies he did like 20 years ago and he wasn&#39;t funny. his openers (amateurs) were way better than him. fuck you bud-dy! if i ever meet him, i&#39;m kicking his ass and stealing his wallet.

will do :)

u dont mind if i use that sometime do you ?

it&#39;s fake there is another video that shows how it was set up...search for it

ok?i dont give a fuck,lol

no 1 does
That looked so Fake .. almost as fake as the obama election

if that wasnt planned, thats fucked up...

really,but yea it was all planned out

sorry not homo ... sure ur sis wants it from u though ;)

fake

lol wasnt meant to sound like u read it lol! just making the point bout someone who comes on stage lol ..... also guys ITS FAKE ... i fell for it too lol

he&#39;s had that coming for YEARS!!! LMAO

fucking idiot ... hes a comdeian ... its his job ... do that to me ill knock u the fuck out !  im 6&#39;3 weigh 230 pounds lean muscle and im starting to do stand up ... i can take someone trying to hackle me but step on my stage and ill kick the shit out of you !

this is really stupid..why put this on the net?

ROFL   BOOOOO&#39;D OFF STAGE

LOSER

I swear the punch didn&#39;t connect, he should have gone out with some dignity after Encino Man.

its fake dur
This is fake.

fake. like wrestling

they prefer to be composed of it

Hey that was harsh, you know you could hurt his pancreas or something lik that...

pauly shore has remained relevant off of these fake video clips he keeps putting together.... maybe its not that bad of a strategy

it should have been quicker. It would have been more reallistic. Because unless the cop moves in slow motion he would have got the guy the second he came on stage.

LMFAO  - it coulodn&#39;t have happened to a more deserving person!

why did he hit him?

poor pauly
man i wish that it was real

lol you know this is fake lol

stupid fucking hick

I wonder if this guy checked his comment on audio preview just to make sure it sounded gangsta. I sure did, can you tell? Sup.

hahahahaha

NOOO FUCKING COW BOY !

lmfao he was crying.. the weasel still kicks ass!

lol that is the best comment I have read this month.

sercurity anybody? somebody! damn dat hurt!

if it was real, the security would have gotten there quicker

i dno if this is staged but if not screw that fukn fat hillbilly, pauly shore is awsome.

HES A WEAZELLLLLLLLLLL

hey hey wtf??!! there is my name wtf??

its westtexas

Yeah, Andy Kaufman&#39;s legacy is not threatened

this is the awesomest staged thing ever!!

the video is fake dumbass. watch &quot;The Making of Pauly Shore Gets Knocked Out&quot;

Nobody. That&#39;s the point. xDDDD

Poor Pauly. I hope that person burns in hell. ^-^ I love meh Pauly Shore. =p

the video is fake

the video is fake dumbass. watch The Making of Pauly Shore Gets Knocked Out

i hope you guys are not taking this video serious. this is fake. watch this video:&quot;The Making of Pauly Shore Gets Knocked Out&quot;

fuk off douchebag
no,you are still crying,wow, morrissey dosent cry as much as you do.

did you get done crying?punkass bitch.
r u going to cry now?just like a liberal.

big shit, he kicked pauly shores wimpy ass...big guys like that are the biggest pussys

i think this is why they say done mess with tecas

I feel sorry for Pauly, poor guy. He&#39;s still awesome.

watch the video again,odessa texas,another dumbass.

texas wasnt even involved in the civil war,dumbass.

i hope everybody knows this is fake

pauly couldn&#39;t take a punch

he just did this cuz it was funny

look up the making of this video

thats why its funny...

pauly shore is still #1

i was thinking that too, but cops wouldn&#39;t get there that fast if someone called them lol.



 But go ahead and search the video: &quot;The making of Pauly Shore gets knocked out&quot;

Dude, look at the guy. It&#39;s not security, it&#39;s a cop. If it&#39;s a small ass comedy club the most security it has is a guy who calls the cops.

dude,dont beat up pauly shore.

rigged my ass that guy splacked pauly shore

How the fuck do you know if he&#39;s a jerk? Have you met him? Quit talking out of your ass! I&#39;ve actually met him before and he was really nice and even had a conversation.

thats some nice tight security there

yeah gotta be fake, unless security hates him they woulda came on long before lol

Rocksinger is right, this was all planned, there is a video of the whole story somewhere.

u guys r all retards if u actually believe this shit was real, it was planned n u can tell he didnt really punch him cus he missed him. fuck ppl r retarded.

fa real either that dude was drunk or jus knew walkin up an punchin him would make him a town hero.

these hicks cant tek a joke, they have such low self esteem lol

And turns out its staged. Look at &quot;the making of Pauly Shore gets punched the fuck out&quot; clip. I guess he did do soomething funny cuz I fell for it. But all the people saying fuck cowboys/Texans are dicks. This guy was a friend of Shore&#39;s and its all an act. Even if he wasn&#39;t, you&#39;d still be dicks.

They laughed cuz it was really funny. Fat cowboy clocks &quot;the weasel&quot;, funniest thing Mr. Shore has ever been associated with. To each their own I guess.

that was mean.. stupid man does&#39;nt have any respect. i am talking bout the hick.. why didn&#39;t anyone stop him from getting on stage?

Hey shelby what is your opinion on Mike Myers. I personally think he should quit while he has Wayne&#39;s world and Austin Powers but he went ahead with the Love Guru which has a chance at tarnishing his career and causing all who have any respect for him to turn there backs and never say yeah baby again...again.

Shelby did we just become best friends?

it was part of the act. no matter how hard he tries his career is over.

hahaha Dane does that too?



well the guy that makes those claims is no longer there, from what I understand he owes lots of people money and is in hiding*lol* But like Dane, I&#39;ve been told they all jack jokes from other comics

I don&#39;t know what to think, at first real, then reading the comments, I think this video is fake.



But still, fucking hilarious! Especially at the end, &quot;Fuck all you fucking whitetrash!&quot;

looks staged to me.

that Hick was being an asshole, but did you hear the laugh he got when he punched pauly? They should go on the road together.

the making of it right to the right guys

you guys are dumb as shit, that was sooo fake... watch the replay, the hit doesnt even connect lol

Does anyone else think that shit is fake??

pauly shore is a piece of fuckin shit. i hope it aint staged

I tend to agree it was staged.Why did it take so long for the security guard/cop to do anything? He should have been RIGHT ON it.Pauly ROCKS...buuddddddyyyyyyy! :)

May have been staged, looking into that, but I have spent years around &quot;cowboys&quot;, and there is a reason all they can do is ride horses and wear jeans 2 sizes too small....

That is NOT funny!  People being a comic is hard enough having people heckel is one thing but to assalt you is every comedians fear. It&#39;s a comedy club not a boxing match. I would have that good ole boy arrested post haste!

it was set up fool! he faked it

Maybe you stupid ass naive people should do some research before you open your pie holes. Both this and the &quot;racist&quot; comments he made, were all a staged act. So people like your dumb ass that believes anything at first glance the media feeds you will maybe think twice before believing just anything.

no he actually got hit, but dis vid is uploaded wrong, cuz i saw da actual footage n it wuz crazy!

It&#39;s fake.

hahah sissy he had 2 punch back

haha i think i would have too.

spoilers : its fake

ITS A FAKE VIDEO YOU FUKIN IDOTS.

it was set up...

wow... i never thought i&#39;d ever have sympathy for pauly shore... but suddenly i kinda feel bad for him.   Sucks to be a has-been.

that was funniest pauly shit i watched

I agree with Polly, people should really shut the fuck up when someone is talkin

lol

yeah lets argue on the computer that makes everyone tough

lol

He&#39;s so useless, yet you still find the need to go an a pathetic rant about him on YOUTUBE while watching a video about him. LOL If he&#39;s useless, you just made yourself look even worse. LOL

Butthurt is fun for all ages.  Use it at least once a day.

Love how the cop comes up after he is &quot;punched&quot;

Odessa texas. one of the hardest places in the country. but yea this was fake.

you can go to texas, just dont mess with it.

Haha. Nah.



But NOW I see your point.

And I understand how I it got misconstrued.



Some people are compelled to post &quot;fake&quot; simply because they&#39;re baffled that people don&#39;t know this yet. They just wanna get the word out!



...I guess? o_O

Well...



...he&#39;s right. And there&#39;s no way he ruined it.

Below this are several comments all saying the same thing.

Do you get a smug sense of satisfaction getting butthurt over trivial things? ^_^

No, it was in fact Fake, but thanks for playing the Post Dumb Comments for Shits and Giggles Game.

Call pauly and ask if it is real....



310-694-7411

FAKE! Paulie&#39; s hard up for attention...buuuuddy

but nooo... its fake!!!

ha ha greatest thing ive ever seen!  I hate Pauly Shore!!  Hes the Weasel lol!!  ha ha  fuc*in idiot!!  dude should have kept going!! made us proud!!

poor Pauly....man he said sorry...the guy just wanted to feel and look tough....why punch him?....Pauly is this skin little rat, i feel sorry for him....

that is so mean that person who punched him is a bitch

you realize it was fake, right? There&#39;s even a &quot;The Making of Pauly Shore Gets Knocked Out&quot; video that shows how they staged it.

lol

fuck&#39;em pauly, it&#39;s nothing but incest in texas

i hate hicks and hill billys

pauly shore is fuckin awesome

Well Pauly&#39;s comment at the end was nothing but the truth

your so cool paulie =)

Wow.  How many people have wanted to do that?

Poor Kid....
PAULY SHORE IS DEAD!

O there s  a guy that dont know what he s talking about

Damn... I thought Polly was awesome. BUUUUDDDYYYYY

Yo, fuck you. Say that shit to any American and watch as yo ass gets beat the fuck down. I am a Soldier of the United States Army and I ain&#39;t letting some dumb fuck from somewhere hee has no balls of saying talk shit like he know anything the fuck he is saying.

All of this was staged so stop talking shit

hahaha...I bet Texans are proud of this shit.

i love the ending, super mario DEAD SONG!

yea its the texans that turned amercia into a shitty country....

yes you can
this is why everyone hates texas

&quot;Hit eem!&quot;  wow.  no wonder our fine country has gone to crap.  Thanks, Texans!

The funniest part of this is that even when Pauly Shore when on TV to explain that it was all a hoax, nobody cared. People preferred to think he actually got punched.

this video was actually staged.look up the &quot;making of pauly shore gets knocked out.&quot;pauly knew cowboy hoss there and told the crowd that he would be playing a heckler and would come on stage and punch them.he also told them to make sure they all got it on film and put it up on the web

lmao, that&#39;s gotta be the most ebarassing thing that could happen, couldnt of happended to a nicer guy tho

youtube.coom/watch?v=pZWURqqMqg0&amp;mode=related&amp;search=

maybe thats how jews spell pauly sorry im not a jew , so i dont spell it that way go back to fucking temple or whatever rock you crawled out of

Learn to spell.

Haha, that was great.  This video reveals more about posters than anything.  As a northerner city boy, this video pissed me off when I saw it.  This video totally feeds into my bias of the south.  I&#39;m sure to southerners this video was vindication for your bias that northerners can talk shit but shake in their boots when actually confronted.

Pauly Shore may be a has-been, but he pulled the greatest Myspace hoax of all time!  This was about to spark another civil war!

too fucking funny, I love his stand up! Staged or not it&#39;s good if you see it before you learn it&#39;s fake...it got me

Im in Odessa, and Pauly is coming again on May the 24th, I have tickets. Ive heard the stories, I really want to know what happened that night, Ill talk to the owners of the Comedy Club to get the scoop

OMFG i hope it was fake but if its fake its so fuckin hilarious :D i love him he rocks !

What did he say at the end before he threw the mike down?

fak&#39;d out of 10

Yer fake, you stoopid. I WAS there and that&#39;s me punching that goofball. Biodome sucks, stoopid!!!

Yea its fake, he comfirmed it at a Comedy Club I went to and he was there..

This is fake.  I saw a video of the making of this.  Pauly Shore set this whole thing up.

Im hella pissed now...
why didnt pauly fucking beat the fuck outta him

Video Is a Fake

amazing, i guess all 30 of pauly shores fans converged on this video.. face it, he was talking out of his ass and got what was coming to him. its not like hes even funny, he should know better. its like seinfeld doing standup in baghdad.. duhhhh

I&#39;ve never heard of the phrase in my entire life.

idk if this was fake or not but that whole bar hated him.  that in itself is funny

i&#39;d give you directions but you would obviously get confused. go bite your pillow.

You&#39;re damn skippy we&#39;re proud to be from Texas. Where the hell are you from? That planet named California? The land of fruits and nuts.

too lazy to do a google news-search p-rick? or wikipedia?

I saw this video first on &#39;The Soup&#39; in which i was then told it was fake, Pauly shore we all know you have sunk low, but this low? sad, why not just come out with &#39;In the army....again&#39;

That was soo fake!

There&#39;s a problem with your theory. Cuba wasn&#39;t blamed for it.

I&#39;ve seen better punches in sitcoms from the 50s, this was so fake.

brilliant

I say very likely.

Texans are retarded

@Aj4Life16, learn how to use english

I thought it was because we ate babies...

Because 2,000 people aren&#39;t dead and those buildings are still standing?

He was also a jackass.

LMAO!! Pauly Shore&#39;s a moron...

Quoted from sonofisis:



&quot;This is fake ya&#39;ll! It&#39;s been confirmed!&quot;



Bs saying &quot;confirmed&quot; implies that this person is claiming that the Odessa &quot;press release&quot; is true.

Fake as hell

*YaWn* well at least it was more entertaining than the guy who claims to own the club and his 4 or 5 same jokes over and fucking over and over....

all YOU&#39;RE doing is talking shit on the internet. dumbass. LoL

Than it turns out you&#39;re really from Texas and that you&#39;re just a self-hating Texan.

Well I wouldn&#39;t say that.

He might even had square danced with him if he wasn&#39;t careful.

You must not like NASA.

Ever been to San Fransisco?

Now come on, hovers is such a strong word.

Someone has some anger issues, and I&#39;m not talking about the guy with the ten gallon hat. Wanna talk about it?

Or maybe they were just thinking that shore was going to get what he had coming to him.

Man.. I&#39;ve never been so embarrassed of living in Texas..

those fuckin hicks take things too seriously.

sit down, shut the fuck up, and try and enjoy the show, and if it sucks, be a polite, reasonable human being, piles of human filth!

you do know that cowboys are not a race...

was he making racial slurs against cowboys?

haha he deserves it!
This is f*kin awesome!  I&#39;ve met Pauly Shore and he&#39;s such an asshole!!  He threw a ceramic plate at one of our busboys and he acted like a pansy-biotch when we offered him food.  He&#39;s a bitch!!  Glad he got punched!!!

LMAO DORK.

and yet, there&#39;s no citation, here or on Wikipedia, to prove that statement as true.

You must be a Texan.

This was staged. It&#39;s not real.

pauly shore is a fuckwad but inbreed hick trash is still inbred hick trash-and this guy proves it-it was fucking set up anyway-who watches pauly shore these days anyway-lame attempt to put him back in the spotlight!

I think it was proven that it was fake...he knew that guy or something, not sure though, but it seems like something he would think is funny

Wow, classy

that seemed really fake...

Well, yeah, apparently they solve problens with violence, pain and punch-hurt.

awesome.  That guy is going to go to jail and paully shore is going to sue him into oblivion.

da weeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaazzzzle strikes! kinda coincidental with da richards deal and all..btw RIP Peter....

you suck Why do you hate him?  Hes annoying? So the fuck what?  You need your face punched in buddy

ITS NOT FAKE ReAD THE DAMN WIKI... OR NEWS FOR THAT MATTER... God ... Pauly Shore isnt a bad person and so what you dont like his humor.. THere are a lot worse things in this world than pauly shore for christ sakes...

What an asshole,  There is nothing wrong with Pauly shore.  Americans, especially the fucking hicks like that guy suck  so bad, they ruin a good thing

Why is Pauly Shore still in the public eye? It was staged.

Thank God someone finally decked that loser! Such a waste of space!

or maybe it is staged.

no its not staged. he doesnt do andy kaufman type of schtick

wikipedia:



&quot;The assault was later revealed to be legitimate. The chief of police of Odessa Texas released a statement reading &quot;After viewing the video, the officer who was employed at the club in an off duty capacity, was contacted by investigators. The officer reported he had not met with Mr. Shore prior to his set, and was not asked to participate in any kind of &#39;skit&#39; or arrangement. The officer stated that the assault was real and that Shore was significantly injured.&quot;

staged

pauly is a fake piece of shit

it was faked...

I&#39;m from Texas and I fucking love Pauly Shore 4 life.

Lawlllll.

Okay...

Maybe they didn&#39;t know who was performing.

Little extreme?

One time....while in the middle of a show Jackie Gleason invited a heckler to step outside....turns out the heckler was heavyweight contender Tony Galento.  Well needless to say....jackie got knocked the fuck out.

Fake! cheap publicity
I dont feel like reading all of these damn comments...so I&#39;m not sure someones already said this. Anyways, it was all a hoax, the dude that hit him was in on it and so were the police. I think he did this to parody the Michael Richards incident. Or...maybe he&#39;s just trying to get some publicity to get his non-existant career back on track =/

he was in odessa for 3 nights, and did 2 shows a night. i went to his early one on the last night and i guess this incident happened during the last show? either way... they&#39;re saying it was a hoax but he didn&#39;t do it during the show i was at. i dunno...

When?

Way to blow something way out of proportion.

We attacked Iraq because our president is from Texas?

LOL it was fake?? Thought it was real, that should of been Kramer who got punched like that.

WOW!!!

FAKE as hell.  He must be starved for attention.

Then push the button HOPBUCK if you&#39;re man enough.

that&#39;s bullcrap, i dont even know how to rate this, i feel bad for pauly shore

Na ah.  He is such a tighter.

ASSSSSSSSSSSHOLE

Lame. What a stupid publicity stunt.

No wonder every other country hates America.

wow that was so fake. That was the weakest thing i&#39;ve seen in a while. What an ass clown.

it was fake. duh.

it appears from the comments made during the last 17 hours or so that shores stunt was irresponsible at best...oh well &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot; i guess...

still no right to hit him

Where was that guy during Kramer&#39;s standup?

&quot;1st of all shut the fuck up fuckin Hoss&quot;



&quot;doood stop dude stop I&#39;m sorry!&quot;
Obvious publicity stunt by a pathetic HAS-BEEN

that punch power is ... over 9000.

The reports have come out - this is OFFICIALLY FAKE.

Have to agree....looks like a badly done wrestling stunt.

First off, he doesn&#39;t get &quot;knocked out&quot; or even close. I don&#39;t think it was real because he ducked way too well and secondly, the cops only come up after he gets hit? Seems pretty staged to me.

Nothing but bunch of losers with stupid hats!

wow....dumbest shit ever!!!!
That was soooooooo not real!

mad fake

you ca&#39;t just say thst and not back it up, how do you know?

pwnt

violence is stupid

Shore came out and said it was staged so get over it...and if Texas is the dumbest state in the nation, i feel bad for the rest of america.

How f-ing stupid have people become?  If you want to get drunk and talk all night with your friends, go to a bar.  If you want to see a comedian, pay the cover, go inside, and enjoy the show.  It&#39;s that simple.  I hope Pauly Shore sues that asshole for everything he&#39;s worth.  If Kramer is getting sued for saying a word, then that guy should be in jail for assault.  What an moron.

The most laughs he got all night was during the profuse bleeding he was experiencing.

Looks real enough, maybe staged?

its fake
