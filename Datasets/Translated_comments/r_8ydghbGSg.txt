2024 anyone?

She’s so hot

2024

I get bullied a lot and each time I feel more and more insecure like I want to kill myself

It really defines how beautiful her voice here is, she looks amazing and has a powerful message, Allhamdulilah 

Anyone in 2024-?

 thanks to be there

Demi Lovato will always be my favorite artist she helped me through the hardest part of growing up 

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

Everybody listening??

Raining again

<b>A u t h e n t i c V i e w s D a w  t C a w m</b>  and Demi Lovato are a match made in heaven, Best song on album this song  

If you're struggling, read this ~ I know I'm young, but I just wanted to say that in 7th grade I was in a very dark place. I couldn't feel much emotion and had thoughts of revenge and other things. But God saved me, gave me the people in my life and showed himself to me. Even on my darkest days, he was there with me, he never left me. One day, while I was in bed, I started praying with my hand facing heaven and I felt something holding my hand. At that precise moment I knew it was him. I repent of all the sins I have committed. I'm ready to start a new life with him. There is still time to repent, love each other and believe in Christ, because he will forgive you️ He helped me through difficult times, he will help you too :)
I love this song. I&#39;m going through a hard breakup right now where I feel like I gave all I could, and he still left... songs like this give me strength.  

I can&#39;t believe demi lovato released skyscraper music video  ahhhhhh

That song is beautiful

cute talentx

The Good News/The Gospel: We all have sinned at one point. There’s wages to sin which is death. Committed sin=separation from God. Jesus died on a cross for humankind to have freedom out away from sin and God’s wrath&amp;to have forgiveness from God. We can receive the freedom bc He paid the wages of sin for us to live :) and He not only died, but resurrected defeating death and sin out of love. Nobody could do it except Him. Salvation=being saved. Everybody has their own Judgment Day which is the day of their death. On that day, God sees if we’d be guilty-Hell (torture) and if free of sin-Heaven(paradise). I wouldn’t wish Hell on anyone bc it’s terrible. To be allowed into Heaven (seriously) we’d need to truly repent(turning away from sin coming to an agreement with God) and follow The Law of Christ Matthew 22:37-39 Romans 7:7-9 It’s not religion, it’s fellowship. <a href="">

Thank you Demi, and I believe in Aliens too, had my own experiences. God bless you!

If you see little rain with powerfull sunshine, maybe you right, Skies are crying on your area. Sometimes Skies are take a bath and shower to washing their body too, and closed their black clouds windows, and then Skies take a shower with a heavy rainfall, that called Skies take a shower..

This song reminds me of the things that have happened in my past. I’m so glad that I made it through the day and nights. I’m doing better for myself now. Thank you for this song.

My mom likes your music like skyscraper

This song makes me walking in the desert-styled forest, and myself sees two seraphim angels in the sky.

Duraa
One counting step on me toreachthis sight about it brought good take it still get out she will take myself from going to see a crowded love coming to take me to once this hit their no payback till it do

she is a bit too intense... a bit... but who knows, maybe I&#39;m tired of women singing about tall buildings

I listened to this song this past year when I finally had to cut my severely toxic, abusive alcoholic mother out of my life. What a powerful song. My goodness. I felt every bit of this song in my soul and still do. I&#39;m listening to it now just bawling my eyes out like a baby. So therapeutic.

this song rightfully deserved a Grammy award.

Best song ever

I love you Demi

This song is too well done. Demi&#39;s voice has tears in it, she sings as if she&#39;s choking up. What an artist!

2023...2024 D.Lovato, never scared to express Herself Respectfully

Listened to this in 2017, came back in 2019, then 2023, and now January 2024!

POV: 12 years later you still find yourself searching this song 

New years days enjoy  corinna doe L 
I went through horrible times during 2011: traumatised, full of anxiety and didn&#39;t go anywhere. This song had such a significance during that time: it made me cry and it meant something to me but I didn&#39;t fully understand it yet back then. Now I listen to that song again 13 years later and the lyrics truly hit me. Because even when he tried to tear me down, I&#39;ll be rising from the ground, like a skyscraper: and I have. It took many years but f<a href="">#ck</a> it, here I am, and nobody can ever hurt me again: Ill always be a skyscraper

Skies are cryingI am watchingCatching tear drops in my handsOnly silenceHas an endingLike we never had a chanceDo you have toMake me feel likeThere is nothing left of meYou can take everything I haveYou can break everything I amLike I&#39;m made of glassLike I&#39;m made of paperGo on and try to tear me downI will be rising from the groundLike a skyscraperLike a skyscraperAs the smoke clearsI awakenAnd untangle you from meWould it make youFeel betterTo watch me while I bleedAll my windowsStill are brokenBut I&#39;m standing on my feetYou can take everything I haveYou can break everything I amLike I&#39;m made of glassLike I&#39;m made of paperGo on and try to tear me downI will be rising from the groundLike a skyscraperLike a skyscraperGo run run runI&#39;m gonna stay right hereWatch you disappear ya yaaGo run run runYa it&#39;s a long way downBut I am closer to the clouds up hereYou can take everything I haveYou can break everything I amLike I&#39;m made of glassLike I&#39;m made of paperGo on and try to tear me downI will be rising from the groundLike a skyscraperLike a skyscraperLike a skyscraperLike a skyscraper

Woody calamity

What a beautiful video

<a href="">1:54</a> It's like I don't care about anything anymore, I have nothing to lose, I'm above everything and everyone 
I’m very confused? Grace Davies should be sharing such excellent content x

This should&#39;ve been her first Grammy.

I remember listening to this depressing and crazy song watching this clip crying and cutting my hair on the crescent moon, Demi how it hurts
2023
i  u
This was one of the first songs I listened to after I ended things with my cheating ex-fiancée. I went through some hard times when that happened, but I&#39;m in a better place now with my girlfriend of two years. I credit not only my girlfriend for helping me through that anguish but also Demi for creating this song.

But clone always for herself so innocent and so sinless than the original  for about to that from the creator&#39;s judgments but why clone for wish less for herself depended to that original  good teach for good done bad teach for bad so that sinfully will be origins so for about the clone gotten to be originiality and original will be gone to the  proxy clone loses for her reality judgments will be done to the  creators when after death the laws for about in theres as you so so you reap ...s.m.a.k.

Are you proxy clone Demi fox

this is to her addiction. i love you DEMI

2023 and I still love this song such a breath of fresh air

I always listen to this song because... now,  i feel better

perfect song
i cant believe this is a real song lol. ive only ever heard the chorus and thought it was a parody or something

Yes I will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper love it

I wish she was  still like this. She&#39;s so effed up now

Maybe you&#39;re fall down to the underland in the hole just hold on to my hand and get up on the landline

Still listening 2023️
Hearing this song reminds me of old memories
Am I the only one to think this is about 9/11 and the aftermath ?

How he deserved a Grammy 
Ever since I was 3 I loved this song I&#39;ve been searching for this song for years I&#39;m 13 now and this is my first time hearing this song in forever.. I&#39;ve finally found it..

She&#39;ll always hold a special place in my heart The strength this song gave me when I was a teenager. This was my lullaby throughout those years of domestic abuse. And the abuse I endured during school

Nice Demi

If you&#39;ve ever lived with a toxic, abusive person who constantly puts you down, you will totally feel this song deep in your soul.

  To the person reading this, even though I don&#39;t know you. I wish you the best of what life has to offer.  ️

I&#39;ve grown up with Demi and I&#39;ve always loved and looked up to her. When this song came out, I was going through one of the hardest times in my life. I used to listen to it everyday and it helped me so much. Fast forward to now, I&#39;ve just overcame THE lowest I&#39;ve ever been and remembered this song. I went to jail. Everything i had was taken from me. And they tried to break me like i was made of glass. This song Hits home. I hope demi is doing okay now

I miss the old demi

Demi used to be my idol still love her music! But as she grew she turned into a not so nice person

Her best song
Yes I found this song on Skeeter Hansen episode.  She sings it way better than the predator did

Someone hearing that wonderful song at 2023?

This was right before the industry destroyed her.

Demi this song save my life and i come back because my mental illness will never go away and f I’m a psychiatrist patient and my obsessive compulsive disorder will never go away, never f never, friends that become foes because I’m not a happy person, they laugh as my blood was running through my arm and i saw the eyes of them, fighting to love myself the new sick me, i die when I was 18 when was inside of my brain pop up as a nightmare, I’m broken and i will be a f beautiful broken fighter of my brain chemistry

What a damn nostalgia back when i was 8 yo at the time.. Really had best moment captured in my mind...

is this considered emo?

I am an Arab ️
 Don&#39;t tear medown I love u .
She hasnt really done anything this good since, but man...what a powerful song. And she nailed it on the vocals. Raw, vulnerable, powerful. A really solid performance.

This song saved me , this song saved my life so many times, this song saved me from my suicidal thoughts too many times and it&#39;s still saving me , demi you don&#39;t even know the power you have on me and so many others 

This beautiful music, voice and lyrics has just lifted my spirits and those of my Son who urged me to listen

I did not search for this. I just found it...I may or may not be lying.

Would you like that come to me go on with the ston cold country 

who is here from a skeeter jean vid <a href="">

Am I the only one who compared it with the rock one

This was 12 years ago that’s crazy

this song hits me in a way that i cannot explain. i have a lot of repressed sadness that expresses itself in unconscious ways. when i hear this song, all my repressed emotions are awakened but i feel safe.

So lovely paradise she&#39;s at all i was love to her so really 

Wow this song was 12 years ago!

This is what I listened to when I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt. They thought I was gonna be in a vegetate state and need a liver transplant. I’m so thankful to the amazing doctors, nurses &amp; social workers for being by my side and helping me. Most of all I’m thankful for God answering my prayers. Doctor said my liver healed itself. We really are beautifully and wonderfully made.

My favorite ️

I sing this song in contest

Came to watch this after watching tributes and memorial videos to the 9/11 attacks all day yesterday on 9-11-2023.  22 years after the that day that shook the world.

I will never understand how Demi didn't have success with this song.
my friend had recommended this particular song back in 2013 when i did not even know about her. Have been listening to this since then and it never gets old.

 Wonderful
I remember seeing this on tv all those years ago. I remember thinking that she is so gorgeous &amp; heartfelt.

Talented, Unforgettable Anthem..
I love you too princess 
I still come back here to cry
Brazilian comment after listening to cliff ll, honestly I thought it was exaggerated, I didn't like it......I loved this one, she rocks and conveys her message with a lot of emotion

I love this song. Heartbreaking

One a famous person said, when you are happy you enjoy the music. But when you are sad you understand the lyrics.

I miss this demi

The best, forever

They try to tear you down but you keep on rising from the the ground , like Jesus Christ.

well... 1.9M LIKE

Demi you are so precious, I used to sing this song even if I don&#39;t sing well, this song is so inspirational.

Every now and then I’ll listen to music for nostalgia purposes and this brings me back to a time I was so broken and felt like I wouldn’t be able to make it. I wanted to give up and I’m so proud of myself for not giving up on myself. Please take care of yourself and learn to love yourself. I promise it will make such a big difference! 

My worst break up this song describe my abusive relationship ️‍

Any person who rejects me deliberately should also be rejected deliberately. Amen.

I just randomly remembered this song

Just like 12 years ago, here I am at 25 years old.
A vengeful Christian song about 9/11.

Rapunzel!!!
We met here
Yes you are Demi

Miss this Demi

Why this song have so much views??????

This song is really nice, but the funny thing is that this was recommended to me after Swine. I dont even know how this is even the same person, Demi was so beautiful and had such an angelic voice. However, now with her latest release her voice is just filled with anger and I cant even call Swine a song, it&#39;s just shouting and anger. Demi completely changed once she started to believe she was oppressed and is clearly unhappy now. It&#39;s a shame, such a waste of talent.

Who came back to this after the skeet predator catch?

I’m still here 2023

Look, I don&#39;t hate demi Lovato or anything and shes a great singer, but she has rlly ler her self go in recent years and has destroyed herself. She used to be so strong. It seems the fame got to her. I mean, just look at her recent Song, the lyrics are vile and it spreads a toxic message. R.I.P Demi Lavato.

In mine opinion this is one of demi best songs, and i wish i or someone else could take all the pain and hurt of the world and cast it out for nowone has to feel pain and hurt ever again 

Going this week

I love this this is the best song ever

Sing after the universe, Giulia be
Skies are crying

I am watching

Catching tear drops in my hands

Only silence

Has an ending

Like we never had a chance

Do you have to

Make me feel like

There is nothing left of me

You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I&#39;m made of glass

Like I&#39;m made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears

I awaken
And untangle you from me

Would it make you

Feel better
To watch me while I bleed

All my windows

Still are broken

But I&#39;m standing on my feet

You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I&#39;m made of glass

Like I&#39;m made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

Go run run run
I&#39;m gonna stay right here

Watch you disappear ya yaa
Go run run run
Ya it&#39;s a long way down

But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I&#39;m made of glass

Like I&#39;m made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

Chicken soup song for my soul

After 11years..im searched for this..i see she sing this song in &quot;extreme home makeover usa&quot; ..fall in love in this song

11 years now wow
She should be standing on top of a building not in some sandy destination lol

TV-PG DL

who&#39;s watch again in 2023

June 2023, still listening to this gem 
m

Utah Salt Flats, Demi Lovato...singing the badass song written by  Kerli. Beautiful  Absolutely never gets old.

Beautiful, I like 
Demi  I love you!!!
As a recovering addict I can tell you that this song is a sense of strength on bad days. Thank you for being raw and original 

Better to stop than cause confusion, as Pierre says, stay at peace, people.
I remember when i was bullied horrendously by my two roomates during my college days and i would listen to this masterpiece on and on through my earpiece up on the terrace.. this song gave me strength and positivity to go on.. thank you Demi

I think she&#39;s brilliant,she writes down what she feels,then makes it a song.Then put her heart into her song.Showing her viewers that were all human,and we go through the storms of life.And she&#39;s brave.courages.strong.Truthful.

demi wanna leafe;&#39;
Mt bom...kk
This song is underrated

Here from the Skeeter Jean Video

Listening to this now.  I needed this

Kerli is awesome!

Coming to terms with the fact that i have a rare illness. I won&#39;t give up and i will get my life back and keep fighting

This song was played at my school leavers assembly 

I didn&#39;t have to search demi has been thee best thing to happen to music tbh as long as I&#39;ve lived. Every song every lyric just hits. &quot;This is me&quot; is my anthem

17/6/2023 
I remember at that time when <a href="">#eliana</a> interviewed <a href="">#demilovato</a> it was simply surreal 
it&#39;s already 2023, and we&#39;re still listening this song

Dear stranger reading this. I don&#39;t know you but I know no matter how bad it feels right now, it will get better. the sun will rise and there will be another day where you don&#39;t feel the way you do right now. Making it through the pain you feel now will be worth those good moments ahead of you. Don&#39;t you give up on yourself, I believe in you and even though I don&#39;t know who you are, I love you.

Everybody listening??
Anyone watching??️
Still kicking with listening this song daily for 10 years, it needs a remake !

Founded here after reading the book Stay Strong

I love this song just the other day I was singing this and writing down the lyrics in class

If you remember this, remember for the sake of SM Joe Jonas first
This song is really well done. Demi's voice has tears, she sings as if she were suffocating. What an artist!
Ex thank you for the pain you makes me wiser and more stronger more than you ever know. Goodbye

that explain my soul 

Go run run ......is  the &quot;finish him&quot; part ....

i dont search for old memoryi search for old song

I&#39;m so proud of how far Demi has come since releasing this song

It's because of Cakra that I'm tired here 
Perfect <3
 Perfect song for anyone in a controlling narcissistic one sided love relationship

Whenever am broken,this song reminds me of myself worth 

this song will always lets me remember how strong i was during this point in time. i was like demi (one year younger), and going through things that i shouldn&#39;t go through that young. but like she did, i preserve and stayed strong. it is still hard now, but light will always be at the end of the tunnel.

2023 still listening to this masterpiece

I miss Demi Lovato 
I like it better in NEW RETRO version
I always loved this song, I had lost it from my memory, but watching the series 911 and at the end of season 4 I cried ️
That&#39;s why you use auto tune and i don&#39;t 

Yes, that&#39;s true, I love so to Demy

Different battles for what you thought was headed your way.

Good night lovely friends 

God please find her again... I can feel your love to her

.

I love  you
Yellow black adoptee goes through a lot, physical abuse at home, down syndrome
I know this is a song demi wrote during her eating disorder and im so thankful for this song. I&#39;ve had a binge eating disorder all my life. The worst of it was this year. I decided I needed to focus on recovery from it. Im 2 weeks binge free and emotionally eating free. This song was listened to on repeat so much so many days. If anyone else is reading this in a similar situation with an eating disorder. Healing is possible. You got this you can do this.  Never ever believe you are less than. You have more strength than you think you do.

&quot;Like we never had a chance...&quot; See christian tattoo on her hand. Yep, you dont have a chance when you believe that horseshit demi.

Reminds me of Christina Grimmie &quot;may her gentle soul rest in peace&quot;got to know Skyscraper from her coversong back then.

Praying for Demi.

It&#39;s ok not to be ok..

I love you

Everybody listening??
I love Demi when she is on this stage, also with &#39;give your heart a break.&#39; I hope you bring back the kind, simpler and much humbler you Demi Lovato. I miss this strong yet a pinch of modesty in you.

2023 + this song still makes me cry

This is hands down her best song ‍

After 12 years of watching this video a bunch, googling where the gorgeous filming location this is so I can go there, I finally got to the other day! Bonneville salt flats have been on my list ever since then, so happy I crossed that off, and it was just as stunning in real life!

It doesn't happen to them that at minute <a href="">3:06</a> they feel like hugging her 
still love this song

This song always makes me feel better

Yes hello 2023 
Love u demi lovato ...from indonesia...fighting !!

beautiful songs️
I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this song right now

Thank you skeeter jean for bringing me here

Did not understand then at 13...I now understand ..this will forever be my song

I only like this version of demi lovato... not the now version of her...

I didn&#39;t searched for this

A great singer, demi, she will always be the greatest
I love demi
nice song to listen to
It still hurts
It still hurts
It still hurts
Whatever happened, stay strong girl.

Who&#39;s here about hearing about her drug relapse ? Good for her that she&#39;s clean now

Hai girl,, 

This was my first relatable and fav song as a teenager. It articulated in my mind what I couldn&#39;t 

2023 anyone??

I miss old Demi 

I heard this song when I was  younger and still love it.

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

This song feels like a hug from my childhood

a pedo sent me here
I will always come back to this song when I need to remember who I am. Just because all you could manage is a two-story duplex, doesn&#39;t mean I have to forget that I wear a crown.

Demi? Rock version of this plssss️

so perfecct so superior now!
Listening to the song for this sake after reading about the case on Twitter, it feels like it's for the sake of conveying what happened.... keep your spirits up for sake
I can speak English
This song always gets me through tough times thank you so much  demi ️

Tremendous anthem Demi gave us. It deserved to be a worldwide success, like Sorry Not Sorry or Heart Attack.
Love your mucit

If i only could say this to her straight to her face

2023 anyone?

a masterpiece

This song was written by Kerli

<a href="">



There a pill for you Prozac

Demi I&#39;m glad we connected for eurovision

Almost April 2023 Still a masterpiece

I watch a guy singing this awfully to Demi

i used to reach the high notes of this song:(

Before the nose job

What a work, more than beautiful, I'm in love with the song and watching the clip now, I loved it
A lot of people say that Demi Lovato is looking uglier each year, but she is gorgeous in my opinion, her heart is warm and kind, and she has better talent. Those people are just jealous because they can&#39;t do the same thing and can&#39;t hit high notes like her. Some people are trying to make her angry and swear or saying something bad and ruining her reputation without knowing. But she is so powerful, no one can destroy her...

I love this song Demi. I’ve heard it so many times and I love it I can relate

Skeeter Jean

It&#39;s 2023 march who are listening to this masterpiece... Realy hit it me..

Even 6 I been singing this song and now I now all the words  this song helped me

the most beautiful song. . .
Anyone else here from Skeeter&#39;s video?

I&#39;m so glad I discovered Demi

I wish more people knew about Demi Lovato because Demi is a warrior.

&quot; would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed &quot; as a self harmer that just hits different

I love this song before but now...

2023  l love
2023 ️️️
Demi Lavoto is god

LMAO. Yes I did!

Poop

2023 I&#39;m still here listening to this beautiful song 

I CAME FROM HER BOOK , STAY STRONG ️
Why does this hit so hard

My ex boyfriend think to me is a robot that have no sensitivity and feelings, he always blaming me and etc. I feel offended by his words to say but I think he&#39;s not sensitive to say it to me. It&#39;s unhuman

11 years passed and here I am again

man 11 months

Demi100%good lyrics100%pure talent100%happy
I like these 11 years ago songs .. simple but so much meaning

2023 March 11 I&#39;m listening to this song going through alot. My bf of 7Years cheat on me and I caught him red handed, he bit me and told me he doesn&#39;t love me anymore. Everything I did for him was my choice he didn&#39;t force me. And left meBut I would rise up like a sky scryaper

Truly a masterpiece

Thank you, Demi

And then she crashed like the twin towers

still a blessing to have this song

still one of my all tome favorite song.

Even when everything is crashing around me Demi always comes through. Even if I have to start again at least I have God and her music

as a student this song motivates me to much and I will listen to it all the time in my life.

I’m here again.  It’s 2023 
What does a desert have to do with a skyscraper?Great song, but it&#39;s a terrible video.

Originally written and recorded by Kerli

The most metaphorically sound song ever written. Hands down. Case closed.

Deam, this hits hard!

GOD
This song has given me strength to keep on going when life feels so dark until I reach where I feel okay.

This song is amazing... But the version from Sam Bailey just hits different... Both masterpieces...

Still part of the search in 2023

I know you won&#39;t see this, but I want to say that I love you. Your music has that unique special vibe.

Ouch

I cry every time I play this song because just like you demi I been fighting and trying

it s me the twins towers by telekinesie becoz of a certain matters

 This song
camp rock

When this song came out I was getting bullied by my classmates so this song would give me strength. Proud of how far I came. Now when  I hear this song, I wish that time travelling was real so that I could tell my younger-self that it’s going to be ok.

This is the best song of all time, always so great 
I would LOVE to discuss how she was feeling during the recording of this video.  It seems as if there was a lot of thinking about the &quot;visuals&quot; of the video and I wonder what, if any, her input was in the scheme/message of the video.

Beautiful love you Queen  this song reminds me of everything in my life that i had to overcome no matter what I picked myself up and made it

Who wrote the song...rettie

this song literally disappeared from my brain and I JUST remembered it now, oh my goodness
