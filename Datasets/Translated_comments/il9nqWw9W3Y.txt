Demi Is Cool

Demi you already are in paradise

2024

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️

It&#39;s a disgrace that they already have the song scratched

So weird agree 😮
I really love the song, listen always and watch it like the first time, the emotions stay always so incredibly awesome, the video and song are beautiful Demi is wonderful. ♥️

I love this song so much bruh it’s amazing

I just a AI big guy, I think it is Yo-Han, a real live bum and jail bird, that is in and out of jail, try not to sign him in your videos, because he is really dangerous he will slip mickey&#39;s in your drinks and your girls drinks, and take advantage of your lives, talk soon Hotties.

Do your riders need earings, like yours too, all of them are Hotties too, like you!

Fly bitch❤😊
Admit, you have already masturbed seeing this clip at puberty 😂😂😂😂

why did I only discover this song in 2023? I missed out on so many years vibing to it. Thank god Taylor Swift danced to it so I could find it

Man I remember hearing this during the summer when I was just a teenager, having the time of my life

always and forever will be cool for the summer

When she wasn&#39;t crazy, fat and gender confused.

Fan of her hair
Reason I like Demi Lovato 😎👌
DEMI ROOMORE

2024 where y’all at!!!

Nostalgia
I am gay . My parents both decided not to practice religion. Grew up in rural Minnesota at a time when it was deemed ungodly . So I had two strikes against me. Years later I would have a chance meeting with two former teachers at a Gay bar.  They pretended to be a romantic straight couple. Both have passed on. Sadly , I don’t think they would hired if they were honest about themselves. Namaste Leroy and Mary

Reminds me of my ex girlfriend 😂
Just mind blowing😊😊

Taylor Swift bought me here

Always be a vibe

I bet her crowd has mosh pits when the hook from this song drops. 😅

So she officially went back to wanting to be identified as a girl now?

2024 😮

Demi is so beautiful she has come so far I love her music

What is the name of the blonde actress in the car ? :D

cool for the porn =)

wow sexy af

Demi, I know that it&#39;s still winter where I am, and it&#39;s not summer anymore again. But, this song rocks any time of the year by you! You go, girl!

A daring deed isn&#39;t that of retained offer when elsing isn&#39;t fought to fit through wonders.but we tend to not avoid its disasters what griefs us is pain given by a sought manipulations.reviving a best category shouldn&#39;t be first desired but envy sorting justice .to state a infamy to engage some sort of completions .only to exceed a policy for neglect that doesn&#39;t comply urgencies.evil mustnt win in most places cause with deficits sure regrets surely follows.aniexty comforts the more independent terms of disagreeing most common invokes.what redeems fate isn&#39;t a sought advantage but a temporary complacency of redirecting a not .weld purpose defining a may how from know  how.intervene a subject  courtesying a need for an entitled sooth is a refined choice.

I&#39;m happy that the songs are trending now. It deserves more recognition than it being as it is literally Demi&#39;s best lead single.😍

I remember watching this on vevo when I was 8 and jumping on the bed to it.. :P

I LOVE HER 🎉❤❤❤
Taylor brought me here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How come David Laid doesn't sing it?
2023 🔥
Since holding schedules often seem unreal at most Christmas times . Our last run with it was less hassling but more hectic just checking views . We apparently got busy on more occasional day then hikes furthering west .recent ones called us out revealing how tedious it’ll be ,. Well i guess better notions are more intuitive than reciting most dos for home keeping . We frequently use ornaments for decorations if the weather gets enough for Christmas. Bad seats often drift our reknown efforts towards having holiday gifts. The celebrations went quite well if every one did  their part . Running a timely campaign to promoting our community private sunctions we’re difficult .but it bring hope to ensure a difference between those around such revolving states .

Holidays  are gradually starting rowdsy. Ain’t no good lurking Karma deducing most things . We apparently can’t denied a awful scene but looks like this Christmas should go out good . Word blunts that the circle of conditions ain’t usually bright for us but that’s always a way for everything .just your doing alright persuading how things aren’t always our way . At least we’re still at surviving these years for another year . Hope you’re having a wonderful day and splendid time doing it . With the medias choice for befitting entertainment you ought to like .

Love you demi Lovato te amor ❤
When she was hot and not bat shit crazy

Saucy song, it&#39;s a vibe dancing to it and feeling good

When I was very little I told my mother that Thalia was the most beautiful woman in the world. I loved her and her soap operas. 😍🎶
Taylor showed me this

gauel lovato

Still obsessed with this song. Demi&#39;s voice is just majestic.

I love demi lovato!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chin scares me

Demi is hot she ain’t cool .

Where has this beautiful young singer been all this time, until now I see her 😘? Katty Perry, Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift and others already have competition 🙂
The biggest anthem of the 2010s
Taylor swift
This reminds me of the game episode

1 Timothy 4:1 (MSG)  The Spirit makes it clear that as time goes on, some are going to give up on the faith and chase after demonic illusions put forth by professional liars.

Genesis 6:6 (MSG)  God was sorry that he had made the human race in the first place; it broke his heart.

Slllllay been listening to this since I was 7

Aside from girls kissing.
Cool to the summer. Verano Fresa

This is how you hallucinate when you hang out with your friends and are a teenager.😂😂😂😂

we were happy and we didn&#39;t know it

Has it really been 8 years? Damn how time flies

i like to listen to this song at 2am🤣🤣🤣

Yep this song is cool for summer . BUT ITS AUTUMN

I heard this song years ago on the radio and liked it at the time. But I never gave it much thought. I heard it again recently and decieded to look it up on YouTube.I&#39;m not into following musicians or celebrities so I had no clue who DL was or what she looked like. But man..talk about beauty mixed with raw sexuality. Almost seems wrong for her to have such a great voice on top of it. 😂

How is it from 8 years ago? KHE
Cool for the summer in the middle of 2023 and it continues to break a great song
G3

Say thanks to Taylor swift  for free promotion 😁

I love this song. i listen to it 1000000 times

<a href="">2:03</a> is literally amazing

As a 23 year old blue collar, red neck, diesel truck repairman and bodywork specialist. I blame this song for being the reason im toxicly attracted to latinas and drinks that have 20 ingredients and dont taste like alcohol.She was stunning when this came out when i was 15. And shes still stunning now.

TAY ROCKED THIS SONG

I was 36 years old when this joint came out.  Am I a dirty old man for thinking that Demi Lovato was drop dead gorgeous and sexy in this video?  I am a man who overall appreciates the beauty of Women, but at my old age of 44 I wouldn&#39;t date a Women younger than say, 28 years old.

I came here coz of my mother Taylor swift

Before she turned to smack I’d of rattled her

My three favorite summer songs is 1 . Cool For The Summer , by Demi Lovato 2 . Summertime Sadness , by Lana Del Rey 3 . Summerboy , by Lady Gaga ...

i did not even know she sung this song...

Cool for the summer

Hello 2024
Sorry being late for this great hit, Taylor’s reaction on VMA bought me here! Nice one ☝🏻

Advice: If you liked a song you heard on Tik Tok, do not search for it on YouTube because you will be as shocked as I was 🤦🏻🌚 I thought that the singer of the song was Korean, beautiful and cute, but the opposite turned out to be the case 🙂💔
she&#39;s so hot

After seeing Taylor peda I'm coming back here 😂
Since listening to this in 2015, good music never goes out of fashion.
What a beautiful concion😘
I&#39;ve listened to this song a few times, and I&#39;m just now realizing this is a Bicurious/ LESBIAN song. 😂

Seeing Taylor all empowered dancing this little song is addictive!! 😍😍😍😍
First time here, I was curious to know what her songs were like, after she sang with Luísa Sonza ❤
Taylor effect
I'm here for Taylor
Taylor made me come back here❤😅

finally found that song Taylor chilling with on MTV awards show...

The 30 yr old man in my dms <a href="">2:19</a>

Who is here after Taylor Swift at VMA&#39;s?

I only remember Taylor singing and dancing to this song
Forever a BOP!!!!

What&#39;s more fragile this woman&#39;s mental health or the Arizona Cardinals secondary ?

Here those who listen to this song and remember Taylor Swift's dance.
This song + Taylor Swift's dance was tattooed in my mind.
On loop at 0.75X! :D
