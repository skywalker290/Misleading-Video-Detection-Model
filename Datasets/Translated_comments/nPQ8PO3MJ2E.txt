Ours from hypocrisy free India ❤❤❤❤
Bss, please make a movie like this in which it is explained how liquor is distributed like whiskey and what are its disadvantages.
Jai Hind 🙏🏻
The real truth exposed in this film. I want to see the full movie.

Mahatma Phule said that taking money from the temple is not a Brahmin's religion.

❤ok
Why are beggars ever supposed to come to the temple? Beggars are never supposed to come to any temple because it is the house of God and beggars can also come in it, that is why Baba does not allow the poor people to come to the temple even if it rains. You are reading this because it should not be like this, you are a human being and you should also worship in the temple.
Film tk hi ye hai aar insaan wah wah krete hai. In real life, people achieve success by knowing everything.
it is absolutely true
Your sobbing shows that the hurt is deep,
Omg 😲 😱 😲 😱 is a wonderful  place to be a good 👍 require 👍 🎵 👌 ❤
Who has bought liquor worth 1000 rupees and who has come to beggar? Don't put 15 rupees worth of milk in Shivling and you have come to beggar.
In such a way people say that the name of hot beef is gaye and a goat is eating...the cry of a milk sister is still there...the cry of a painful cow is heard...Dogale
The country needs you.
Saluteeeeeeeee🙏

These two Indian actors are telling the harm of milking on Shivling, but they themselves are advertising liquor and cigarettes, it is not their place to tell about their harm.
Haramzada movie banane wala
My blunt reply to all the religious opponents of this picture is with a Siddha Chaupai from Ramcharitmanas &quot;Whoever makes someone happy and sad. Enjoy your own deeds, brother.&quot; Which means that 'no one is going to give happiness or sorrow to anyone'. Everyone suffers the consequences of their own actions.
Actually irl milk never goes waste like this they ll collect it n serve it to bhakts if any temple wastes milk wastes like this means its their fault not the ritual

My heart salutes Jai Bhim Jai Samvidhan, there is no God.
God bless you

So much attention is paid to themselves that they do not milk the poor, so much money they themselves earn, I have seen that no one has donated.
Great actor yrrr too good too good

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Imagine making this movie in this age of internet 🤣

Abhi kuch din pehle kisi ne bol Diya tha ki shivling pe doodh ka wastage hai to hr Hindu chilla pada tha is movie ko dekh ke to bade maje liye jate Hain isme nahi dikhta dhrm ka apman

What would have happened if Rawal ji was Amir Khan?
If the milk is getting waste that’s the fault of the temple not all temples are made like this . Only when it comes to Hindu gods they have audicity to show this why not for other religions extremely pathetic

Good😂😂😂

When religion is being mocked and people are clapping after seeing it, today the existence of our own father God is being mocked and the people of the country are clapping, then this is the ultimate sign of Kaliyuga and the world. The end is near 😡 Hey, these are the arguments of the film, even the children of our Vridavan can give a good answer to these low-intelligence film directors and the Hindus of this country are fools whatever they want. Be it PK or omg, omg 2 the bastard makes fun of God and earns money and most of the Sanatani people support him, it is a matter of shame 😞Har Har Mahadev
Aaj kal ke time to anti lindu ka drama sharu kr dete

Its director has insulted Hindus.. but he has shown it to another religion by making the film 'Upper Upper'. ,
God knows why he will not come to court.
This is our family Favorite. Mr. Kumar is Amazing with his choice of movies and he gives it the best, whatever his role might be. Wishing him Tons of Luck, Best Wishes and Reward for his continued efforts and contributions to Indian Cinema.

It takes guts to make such a movie todayOtherwise Andbhakt and Andhnamzis will boycott it

Today, in the time of Bageshwar, Nageshwar, Asaram, Ram Rahim, OMG and PK should be shown on every screen.
Govind naamdev🔥
Is it possible to make such a movie in today's India? You will be shocked to speak like this.
This is really a lot of ignorance.
There is a need to understand this scene of the film. The movie is not opposing PK or omg, Ishwar Bhagwan Khuda Waheguru or any god. The film is explaining the meaning of religion that God resides in man and resides in his heart. And humanity and human needs are bigger than customs and traditions.
What's the matter 😃 Paresh Rawal and who will drink milk 🤪😃 You idiot call the father God 🙏🏻
Don&#39;t always highlight by insulting philosophy of hindu gods to make films. If you want then equally highlight all religion

God is not found in the idols installed in temples, but in living beings.
There are many such directors in this film

Thank you Paresh Rawal ji for exposing the hypocrites,👏👏👏👏👏
What is the truth Sir, this Hindu Pandit is making Hindus happy 👍👍👍👍👍
Paresh Rawal, how many poor people have been milked and fed today... how many poor people have been fed food... how many schools have been built...
now since paresh rawal has joined bjp...he has become pro hindu...if you haven&#39;t read our scriptures like shivmahapuran,ramcharitmanas and shrimadbhagvat...then don;t comment on it....ye hamari aastha hai bhagwan shiv par isliye hum un par chadate hainnn...aur ninda karna apne dharm ki ye bahut bada paap hai

Bullshit. Many temples in south give free food daily. Will Paresh Rawal do it?? And giving donation is purely voluntary. This has been going on for thousands of years. And he compares temples offering food to a gutkha manufacturer. What crap minded the films producer and director are. Does worshipping god harm your health like pan and gutkha. It gives inner peace and mental strength. It gives hope which these hopeless actors don&#39;t give. Just cursing hindu religion and making money is their character. They won&#39;t hesitate to sell their mothers also to mint money. These kind of hypocrites should be flogged in public

Super sir movie 😭
That's why great men...when it comes to education...if you build a temple then you will become equal to beggars.
What a great concept..

Now don't make a movie, children's nunu, halala, or even on a sheet, I won't make it because I don't want to see the truth 🤣🇮🇳

How many people did this film maker milk? Sushant Rajpoot came from a small village and asked him to do the movie because he did not have a godfather in the film line. They always make fun of Hindu Gods and Goddesses.
This movie also has more drama than PK, brother.
Devotees, tell me one thing, is God being respected or disrespected in this film? It was he who was disrespected in the PK film.
Now wake up Hindus, these people are openly insulting our God 🤬😡 Jai Sanatan 🚩 Har Har Mahadev 🚩 Jai Shri Ram
It&#39;s such a sad state of affairs when it comes to milk offerrings to dieties 💔 Either totally wasted in drains or in name of good management....  collected milk is usually given back to financially able devotees as Prasad or charanamrit!! They arent hungry or poor, they don&#39;t need it!!!!Good management means that all the collected milk is served only to poor, hungry, needy humans &amp; stray or homeless animals ! ... So that no human or animal has to sleep on an empty stomach 💔

An artist like Paresh Rawal has been made to blaspheme God so much, shame on Bollywood cinema. They have recently seen the consequences of attacking faith. If they are their father's children then they should make such films and show them on religions other than Hinduism and their beliefs.

Jai shree Ram ❤ Allah Hu Akbar ❤ Hindu Muslim bhai bhai == India ❤❤
The same message was given in Aamir Khan's account also.
Mainly, it is not true in the society that how can numbers like yours appear now because our God is very merciful, I understand that we are going to fight against the UN too, you see.
How many people have you got the right to say this? It has been learned that what is the meaning of milking the face of Lord Shankar. Because of this, how many people have you fed in the spring of your film Drishti. We never asked for Sawan. They have been milked, their process has been completed, the time has gone from zero to 100, Mahakal has taken them, why are they being said, why are they being told, why are they being told, first learn the language and raise your head from above.
To the businessman, go to my side and become a priest to the temple. You will stay here, but what will a human being do in a business like yours? Will he run to the temple and bow his head to God? Keep it and see for yourself because you are burdened with installments, right?
Go ahead of the first Murti Puja, where will you see God walking? 2000 years ago, people who did not do Murti Puja, God established this culture of ours, which is in our hands, and those who are saying it, read more about this culture. hey
You can follow even the Sadak of Ham to Road as per your wish and even if you sit in the temple, God will not go in your footsteps.
In your film Drishti ke andar Ek Chhota sa dialogue Insan na boll paaye to use entry nahin use bahar nikal hai jata hai not only one technology but we have to protect our temple, which is yours. There is a problem, the reins are in someone else's hands, yours is speaking, your voice is speaking.
How many adult movies have been made in your film industry? Ghumna Sanskar Forget all this, what are you, people have given you?
How much have you ever given to a junior artist in your film industry? 150-200 ₹400 Mein, how much have you ever given to him from your income, but not the same film Drishti Jab mein target kar ki aisa bhi to tum per fat karke open mouth Gujarati mind is business mind, send whatever you want.
Have we ever said that a temple should not be placed in a shopping mall, but you have a problem that why there is no shopping mall instead of a temple, where is the faith in our inner world, we do not recognize our true nature, the joy within us does not awaken in us. Neither did I make you like a girl nor did you learn to see my name.
First of all look at Naam Hi oh my god in English mein Naam hi Diya Gaya Hai OMG hai mere God Hai hai hi nahin to Pahli Baat To Yahi failte
Sorry to say I don&#39;t want to do any hindu muslim i respect all religion, but this is tru if any muslim actor like sharukh salman Or Amir would have done this role  , tou kyaaa hota????  Kitny hindu sanghthan bycott karny khary ho jaaty.

Paresh rawal took the most dangerous topic

Excellent  &amp; awakening  👍

Gooooood movie

Aamir Khan said that he is anti-Hindu and Akshay and Paresh ji said that wah wah...Why brother, this is such a double entendre...
Abe kala patthar kya h be shivling... Tum log sale esii liye bollywood ke L... Lge hue h

So nice comments..but if amir khan acts the same then anti-hindu and fir and boycot

Haaaaaa

Now you are trying to kill everyone's God, but you are trying to kill everyone.
If you tell me about the nuclear reactors then you will not have to read it or you will have to cover yourself with your earnings, what is the meaning of our condition and you will be left trembling in the hands of a beggar. What is the value or price of wine?
Great movie

Every single thing of the film is true, God does not want anything after offering his laddu, he also gives water to the hungry Shraddha, or folds his hands too, he becomes happy with that, but he gives his Shraddha in the temple. This should be given because the temple also has its own expenses. If you want to please God, never take advantage of someone's weakness by helping someone else. Do not take advantage of someone else's weakness. Do not go to the temple but do good deeds. Because God has fallen according to karma Radhe Radhe Shri Radhe Krishna
Worship of God should be done in the name of God and not the one who loots. First one should calm down then it should be said that peace should be done for the sake of God, now it is incited in the name of God.
If this role is given to Aamir Khan 😐😐

This is a mistake and I should not speak black stone to Lord Shiva 🙄🙄🙄 respect me 👍pr ye sahi said inko milk is total waste hai sisi accha k ke gareeb ko drink 👍👍 jo heart c dua lti 👍that band ki hai &quot;God tum. bhala kre&quot;
Agar koi khan a movie karta tho Avi BJP unke Piche parjata hath dho k😭😭

Sub is wrong goad hai
Now once again make a movie about Mohammad, it will be fun also about divorce and halala. brother will come.

Jai bheem sir 🙏
Hindutva has not been attacked in this cinema, has it?
If this movie had been released now, it would have been so dirty, it would have been boycotted, I can't tell.

This is how Aamir Khan calls for boycott.
This movie which is copy paste from Akshay Kumar Tamil story, before this the same movie was released in Tamil, our Mumbai Bollywood actors become super stars from Tamil cinema by copying, they have taken hundreds of movies from Akshay Kumar Tamil story.
It is true that there can be no greater religion than feeding the hungry.
Oh my God best movie
bhagwan shiv hamare Aradhya hai agar apni kamai ka dudh un per chadhate hai to ap bolne wale kon hote ho ? agar logo ka vishwas hai shivling per dudh chadane se unki echha puri hogi to ap kon hote ho unka vishwas todane wale ? he gyan kya srif hindu dharm ke bare me hai ?

Why are you wasting money on watching movie ? Shiv ji our Father and giving milk to our Father is not waste. you watching movies of 250 rs and give milk to shiv ji of 20     rupes is waste.. why people destroying only sanatan dharm And protecting sanatan dharm is my dharm In Bhagwat Gita Krishna says Protect your dharm and dham protect you....Being a sanatani if me sahi hu Like me

I saved my father's money and saved it.
Just a disrespect of hindu&#39;s god... God is out father and no one can stop to give milk or anything else to give him or her ..movie hit but disgusting

Good movie

We all are followers of Sanatan Dharma, you did not know what will happen to Bollywood. Jay Shri Ram

Great movie

Please respect Hindus GOD 🙏Don&#39;t try Ridiculous to Hindu God ☝️

Today's people think about everything scientifically, but keeping science aside, if we see why milk is offered to Shivling, let me tell you today. How will you feel if a person earns money and does not feed his parents. If there is a beggar sitting near his door, then which person would be the one who, instead of giving food or money to his parents, would first give it to that hungry beggar? Similarly, God is our parent and the sustainer of this world. It is our duty to If you earn so much, then offer a little something for them also. Although God does not need our things, but we can awaken religion in God by offering some part of our black earnings in front of God. I say, if God is offered 100 kg. If you offer 200 kg then distribute it among the poor, but I do not consider it my duty to cut off God's money and distribute it among the poor. Why doesn't anyone say anything about religion where a sheet is offered at the tomb instead of the poor or in the church instead of the poor's hut? Candles are offered.
Jai bhim namo budhey

It is a matter of shame that people will talk about our temples like this.
Why you are making the story about god...no any concept have you.....

This is 100 percent true that in today's world such a film which actually shows the superstitions and evils of the society cannot be banned... how intolerant we have become in just 10 years... this is the achievement of this government. ki
It&#39;s funny to see how hypocrites have issues with films like PK but not with even a bolder movie like OMG 😂...Rip...The 8th fail boycott gang members are spreading news as if Aamir Khan told not to pour milk on Shivling...In reality Akshay kumar told this in interview 😆

All the knowledge of Gutterwood is only for Hindus. If anyone else speaks on any religion, all the knowledge will be buried in the backside.
Bhart ma srif vakbas hai launges be vakbas sex in the same way as the one you have to be be a good

If this movie had been made by a Muslim then when would Mirchi have started in the Hindu's ass 🤣😅
Shiv ji is breaking stones for a few rupees.
More and more films like O my god and PK should be made.
This is just to defame Hindus.
Bollywood has a lack of knowledge , they only play with sentiments of hindu , they show hindu as culprit but in real life they are afraid of islamic Terrorists and can&#39;t make a film on them , we should watch film like Kashmir files to see reality of world

Super 😆😂🤣
Have you heard the name of Bhandara? How many people get food? Show positive also and I will fold my hands and say that I have not spoken much about Shivling. Har😭😭 Har Mahadev 🕉️🕉️
😭😭 har har mahadev
It is a matter of my sharadha.. One can pray to someone who wants to pray.. Abhishek is done from the milk of Shiva.. Or it is a matter of calling Shiv ji a stone, that is very wrong..
The guy who is arguing with paresh rawal reminds me up&#39;s Cm yogi

They are making fun of our religion. Even after watching the show of bait, if you don't feel bad then you are a child of a chakka.
@ <a href="">0:48</a> Paresh ji is the beggar of the spring of the temple, he has only paid himself..!! 😅yah seriously...
Shame on you, such a movie is a hit in the country of Hindus🚩🚩🚩🚩🕉
These bollywood people will not stop, they always target the Hindu religion, it is Islam, they make sacrifices because of this, why is this species sacrificed?
This was seen by pk also, but everybody is boycotting his upcoming film.

TUMHARI MOVIE TO CRORO RUPEES KI BENTI HAI TO WHY NHI UN CRORO RUPEES SE KISI GARB KO KHANA HILA DETE HO BOLO AYE HO GIAN PELNE 😡😡😡🤬

In this way, it is better to give a bedsheet to a stranger in hot weather than to spread a bedsheet on the tomb.
Paresh Rawal has exposed the pundits very well. If this happens in real life and not in reel, then half of the hypocritical pundits will be killed.
This is what is going on in our country
So when Paresh Rawal said it was fine when Aamir Khan says the same thing people are protesting. And being a Hindu I agree with both these guys. Poor people die of hunger everyday. Pray to God, believe in God by serving humanity.  🙏🏻

You can only agree to this when you have a low Sanatani knowledge... ✨

My biggest blessing is Sikhism, the rest of the reasons are respected in Gurdwaras, everyone is respected even if they are VIPs.

It is very difficult to make such a movie in today's date.
Very nice muvi

Whatever message is shown... It&#39;s right.. But the main problem is they only make fun of gods of one religion..bollywood humesha se ey karta aa raha he... And we are still giving them freedom to do so..😞

Which movie of Akshay Kumar should you watch? Hindu or Muslim, he worships the Goddess Devtaon, drinks milk of Shivling, he says that Akshay Kumar loves you.
Sometimes the other party should also understand why this thing is only for Hindus.
Paresh is exllent human being

Re-release this movie And you&#39;ll see boycotts/protests in every BJP States..

Just imagine guy if this movie had to be launch in 2022.

Fool's kanji comes to the mind like something written on paper but the letter of the paper is not soil. Just like the milk that has been offered to God comes to God but we fools think that God does not accept the dust Om Namah Shivay 🚩

Paresh raval is the best actor of this movie 👌

Don't drink alcohol. Make a picture out of it. You taught the world to drink alcohol. I don't like to drink. I don't drink to forget my sorrows. I didn't make a picture about alcohol and inserted a SIM in one of the pictures and drank alcohol. Thousands of crores of rupees were made in this picture of how many people. You have built a school for so many people. You can easily tell him that don't offer milk to Shankar ji outside your house and drink water.
The fools care about a glass of milk, but those who spend money on alcohol, movie tickets, parties, those who eat non-veg are the ones who are fools, those who eat for the pleasure of killing any living being are the ones who keep the knowledge of Hindu religion, that's it. eat goo 😡😡
The biggest building near Sidhesher temple. Shasri's cake car number 999
Who is the director of this movie? He is heartily thankful to us and he has tried to open the eyes of devotees. We love you sir.
Waah kala pathar not sivling

The milk is actually collected as charanamrita and then distributed among the devotees.  The Shivling is made up of rock rich in various kinds of minerals and after it is bathed with the milk, the minerals get dissolved in it which are good for us in many ways. I don&#39;t understand why these bollywood films are deliberately trying to disgrace our religion without even knowing the H of Hinduism. Other religions also have tons of drawbacks, please make films, ads and web series on them as well. Why always target Hinduism?

Way better than that propagandist trash PK.

He called Shivling a stone
And devotee log to paresh and akshay is considered a big hindu supporter 🤣🤣
Wah ki sahi hai lat Marta hu siv pe

What is religion?Religion is that very thing that makes people either helpless or terrorists.

Have you dirty movie actors ever donated anything to the poor?
When this BJP Bastard Paresh Rawal called Shivalinga &quot;Patthar&quot; then it&#39;s fine for BJP brigade

How many poor people do you feed milk to? There will be no thirst for water outside your house, the thirsty people were dying, we offer milk to Shankar ji, you must have earned crores of rupees in this film, you did not even run Annakshetra area, how many houses were built for the poor people? It is given that I don't drink alcohol, it doesn't make any picture and the hunter is giving alcohol to the world, I don't like to drink, I don't drink to forget my sorrows, when you play songs to forget my sorrows, the sim of drinking alcohol has been inserted in this picture, sitting on a swing, drinking alcohol. There is no money involved in the scenes. How many pictures have you made on alcohol and in the above pictures you show obscene scenes. You say, don't offer milk to Shankar ji. He pours alcohol while drinking when you are not getting any benefit. That alcohol too is so expensive.
they made a mistake in the last
Bhosari's road traffic jam is becoming a problem.
After offering milk on Shivlinga, people do not throw it in the gutter. They collect it and give it to everyone as Prasad. There is also a ritual of offering milk on Shivlinga. It is not that people come anytime and offer milk, what to do on it. People see only this temple at the liquor shop. No matter how much money is spent in pubs, restaurants, hotels, they do not say anything here, but if milk mixed with water is offered to God, they talk big.
Hindu. Religion. First. Religion. HaiJisme. Sabse. Jayada. Andhvishvaas. Yes.
Loved this movie!❤

Indian people still do not understand
Plz upload full movie...no buy or rent

Why did we call Shivling into stone? Our devotee is still facing no problem, is it? Because this is Bhartiya Janta Party main. He has been seen by Zeshan Ayub just here.
It is not so...we Hindus are making fun of our religion, our God...in this movie we are making fun of our God Shiva and Krishna and we are making fun of this Ghatiya log movie..because Bollywood is such a thing where only we can make fun of the God of Hindus and not the God of any other religion..it's a matter of fact that this is how we are describing Bollywood.
I am going to accept Islam ❤️❤️
Hey, don't say these things in any Gurukul.
It is better to give milk than to drink it. So take 5 rupees separately and give it to me, otherwise we should not do all the things related to religion, when we will move ahead, China is ahead, Russia is ahead, America is Japan, Saudi Arabia, everyone should follow their religion. Believe it like that. Hey, in Vin Diesel's Fast and Furious, he also completely locates Jesus, keeps him with his fan, kisses him, helps his family. Hey, in Interstellar, it was mentioned that the second universe is in different opposite states of time, it was 1 hour in some other world i.e. another planet. Equal to 25 years, this is also in our Vedas, Black Hole Theory in Vedas, In Inception, Dreams within dreams i.e. illusion of dreams, these are also in Puranas i.e. Future Purana, Garuda Purana, and also in Vedas and in Matrix movie, this whole world is a lie, there is no truth in front of us. Hey, all this is a web of illusion, we have to find out the true world, what condition it is in and the whole world saw all these movies 🔥🔥🔥🙏Now I understand something 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏😏
He is teaching that he himself earned money and went away. Hey brother, all the money, cricket and other games like football, such big stadiums, so much money is spent that the poverty of the whole world can be eliminated forever. Hey, please help first. Respect others, this is what religion has taught, humanity is what is taught, then who are these who teach this? People of all religions consider their religion as complete. Saudi Arabia is so developed, Mecca and Medina, but no non-Muslim will go to this world. sabde big church, that too no non-Christian will go inside and the holiest of Hindus is Kashi Mathura but you will find big mosques and churches, hey we taught the world, they teach us, Shivlinga is considered by all the religions and it calls them a big stone. Wait, God is everywhere, but why do we go to the temple, I tell you, we drink water in a glass, but water is everywhere, it is also in the air in the form of hydrogen, so don't suck it from the air, why do we drink it on a glass when we drink it on a piece of paper? As soon as I saw my father, I did it in the form of a picture. We can't see God in a statue made in the form of stone. Director and actor of O May God. 🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏
Very nice if you help others understand others have compassion for others that&#39;s true religion and faith of humanity

This is a very disturbing truth
It&#39;s funny &#39;cause Paresh is hardcore modi bhakat.

Kala Patthar word used which is wrong

This is wrong. Bhagwan Ko dudh etc chada sakte hai. Bhagwad Geeta me likha hai k Bhagwan Patram Pushpam Pani, Dudh accept karte hai. Plz read Bhagavad Gita

YE JO FILM BANAYA FILM KI KAMAI ME SE KITI PARCENT GARIBO ME BATA HAI ABE CHUTIYE KISI KI AASTHA PAR CHOT NHI PAHUCHANA CHAHIYE HIMMAR ISLAM PAR FILM BANA K DIKHA CHUTIYE

This video is against Hindu religion
Movie name plz
Very nice good

Panchendriyo par niyanthran rakho...Mannn me dayaa...karuna rakho..bus ithna karo...yahi paramaanandh hai..
Maybe the director of the movie is not aware of the fact that he is drinking milk on Shivling. God never said whether he himself was hungry or whether he should drink milk from me. People drink these milk according to their happiness or sadness.

He has no right that he should call Shivling a black stone.Director&#39;s motive is desired but the method is wrong😡😡

Offering milk on Shivalinga is a belief and tradition of us Hindus.
Why do people ring bells in temples when all the Babas are like Chinmayanand?
this movie manipulated it so well....



showing muslims rational and only temples the sites of sin !



good job !! good job public ..... you proved to be easiest fools to get manipulated !!

Paresh rawal kapoor khan ka dalal
Very stupid👍
It is right to feed Shivling but the way this scene is represented here is it's totally wrong.
Guys believe it or not but in name of Jesus you can pray anything doesn&#39;t need anything offerings and all ,,real god needs only heart ,,even in Christianity it is prohibited to worship even the statue

Salute to this movie director... 🙏🙏

Kanji dada hai hai
Kanji bhai, do you have the courage to prove it even to Allah once? Naani yaad will come. That too in just two minutes 😅
Have you ever made a film on the topic that innocent goats should not be killed on the day of Bakri Eid?

it's a stupid movie
These horses will not lose their minds after seeing this. How will this stone help you people?
Super 👌 👍
😀😀😀

Om

And Aamir Khan did not tell that in the PK movie, instead of sacrificing the goat, the money for the goat should be given to a fakir, with this Allah is happy, the goats are happy and the fakir is also happy.
This guy Aamir Khan and Kanji say that giving milk to the poor is better than offering milk at Shivling, but he does not say that instead of watching the film, give the ticket to the poor and the money for popcorn.
The budget of the movie is 20 crores, the box office earned is 80 crores, how many poor people did not get even 0% of it, the price is still increasing, a lot of money is spent in the world cup, even a little of that money should be used for the poor to help the poor 😈😈 🧐🔥😈😈
These Bollywood people are making fun of our religion, and it is our shame that we are making movies of our Hindu brothers and sisters a blockbuster 🔥😈🔥
Make a movie on Muslims for once and it will work. Why is he focusing only on Hindu religion every time?
I&#39;m agree with these movie but these movie is only targets sanatana culture...Have you guts about make on islam...

Haqikat accept kro

Everyone is being deceived by the app that milk is not being wasted, it is being distributed to children, idiots, poor people as an advice to collect milk in buckets.
Saheb, leave your worship to Kabir ji.
Om Namah Shivaye
Telugu movie copy
I really hate this scene , Kala patthar , this is not the way someone can address the fait of many people, Derogatory remarks on Any religion is not a creativity... shamefull dialogues

Today I also called Shivling a stone at home, mummy got angry, no one could understand the message that God does not want to drink milk, God wants to see poor people drinking milk.
Chanamrit, Peda are made mostly from milk. If you want to give more knowledge then sometimes give it on Halal, give it on the ruthless killing of crores of goats on Bakrid. Karachiwood Tattywood.
Gandi movie
😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🖕👎👎👎👎 When you fall without words then you will remember God,,,but this sacred circle of God made the story writer realize his mistake,,,how many Dalits are Muslims. You are happy in the cmt box because you did not raise the issue of their religion,,,,,,our religion is available to you,,,,,,, wish we had the honor of cutting the garden on the path of Muslim religion,
andh bhakt kiya jane
Yeh movie ko to abhi modi aur yogi ji hi hi nhi hona release dete dhrm ko ka sankat me ke ke hai
Because Hindu is Udar that's why this movie went on
Yes, this is a good thing but Babu Bhaiya, you have shared how much poverty you have donated, how many hospitals or schools you have built, you have earned thousands of crores, a human being cannot even think about this, 1 crore is amazing, or you are not mistaken. I have to do it right now but I don't have to point my fingers to God and I felt guilty about it. I am really sorry Bhai....
This priest is exactly like our Yogi.
Hats off to this movie...

Yese movie 2014 se pehle banti thi aaj ke time pe inta mind wash ho gaya hai ki aag lag jayegi

♥ Touching
This courage is only for Hindus and not for Muslims.
If they had released the movie now, BJP/RSS/Bajrang Dal everyone would demand a ban. Also, they would send the actors and directors to jail for insulting Hindu sentiments. This movie is not possible in 2022. Glad it was released in 2012.

There may be thousands of priests in a Hindu temple, but they do not ask for salary like the Molanas and Molavis. If the movie had the courage to show the nonsense, it would have said all these things in clear words about Islam also.
Saram karo Saram Patthar khte hue saram nhi aati
I don't know how many lakhs of people have seen this video...but I am sure that out of the lakhs, even 400 people will not be crazy again...that's my belief. And what is the difference between Adharma and Adharma? Just whatever the priest or Pandit says to do, you do it… 😆

My favourite movie 😍
God and Shraddha are a different matter and donating to the poor is a different matter. But they will not understand
Disrespect of Our Sanatan Dharma. Bollywood tera thu thu

Director sir, I am aware of you.
If this film is still made then when will it be released??
I like this mov

Paresh Rawal ki jai honJai hindVandematramwhat a good moviethat is a good one

How much have you learned from this movie...How many people will you pray for after asking?
A true God, it is very wrong to speak of a black stone as a spitting stone on the hungry soul, and we, God, have disliked this move.

Wow👏👏👏👏👏
This is the reality

You see, Muslim people say that Hindu religion is not a religion for us or this movie is our favorite for Hindus because we do not associate every thing with religion, neither colors nor animals, nor clothes are linked with any thing. I don't want to add anything so please don't forget to cry.

Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal could have done this nice work Because of our Tolerance. Every Social issue is addressed Taking our Sanatan Dharma as a case; no other religions. Still we boast &quot;Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah&quot;. But it&#39;s time to tell these people that every religion has some flaws and they can have them as options for upcoming social works. But these coward Actors do not have guts to do so.

Religions are like curses on humans...lots of killings and pain in the name of God. History is full of such examples... Even today. Only in India we had some great philosophies like Jainism, Buddhism which are atheist and believe in self control and karma not in blind bhakti and complete submittance to irrational superstitious god.

Kya bakwas movie hai flop movie

Faith or worship comes from man, not from temple or mosque. I salute and appreciate to OMG director.

After all, why only Hindu religion is shown below, there are other religions too.

First Of All No One Has Given Right To Bollywood People To Call Shiva Lingam As A Stone. It Is In Our Religion. It Is Shiva Lingam That&#39;s It Supreme Of All. And If They Do So Why They Are Targetting Only Sanatan Dharma. Why Not The Other Communities Where People Out Of The Community Aren&#39;t Allowed Inside Their Belief&#39;s Places. Even Though There Is A Science Behind Shivling And Milk. As Per Ayurveda And Our Vedas Shiv Ling Is In Shape Of Universe With A Centeric Energy. And Exact Below The Pyramid Shape Shiv Ling Is Kept As Pyramid Produces High Energy. Also Shiva Ling Has 4 Tatva(Stone, Air, Heat Due To Sunlight, And Sky.) Every Thing Needs 5 Tatva For Evergy And Hence We Pour Milk, Water On Shiva Lingam So It Produces High Energy. And We Get Positive Energy From Shiva Lingam. And Many Things Shown In This Movie Is Fake Each Hindu Cultute, Mantra And Ritual Has A Scientific Religion.

God is just Allah Allah has no need of food Allah is one There is no God except Allah😑😑😑😑

Salute to the courage of the filmmaker
omg why is the movie not on youtube
Misleading movie bycottt😠
I am proud of the film maker who took so much courage and brought this issue to light.
Partially agree with the points. But cheap sentimental card of serving the poor was at play too.  Serving the poor and offering something to God need not be mutually exclusive. Plus no one forced the people to offer anything to anyone. They were standing in the queue voluntarily cause thats what they wanted to do acting on their own belief.

Please My Hindus brothers and sisters, this bollywood can demean our Sanatan Sharma see we hindus are majority and this bastard Bollywood is defaming and demeaning our Sanatan Dharma and Our Gods. And please one more request my Hindu Brothers and Sisters please we need to remove this type of behavior ki chalo jane do, shod do, no if we all unite and stand for our Sanatan Dharma, These madorchod bollywood and so called secularist politicians will never dare to say or do anything Against Sanatan Dharma. Our Sanatan was best, is best and always be best, jai Shree Ram, Jai Shree Krishna, Har Har Mahadev🚩🚩🚩

Shivling was given a black stone or the movie was shot.
Milk is only wasted in the temple&#39;s with bad management . In good managed temple&#39;s that milk is collected and then purified and then served to devotees as charnamrit aur any kind of prasad .

Wow very nice movi

It is not right to say or speak bad about any religion. Respect every religion. This is the most important thing in our country. It is not right to speak or think bad.😑😞🙏😞😑🙏🙏
No talking about the goat sacrifice in eid???

Aamir did the same but he is labelled as Anti Hindu.

I  just love  this moove

Chlo is the same thing on the temple, I will see when the church or mosque will be discussed again.
Shame on such actors who call themselves Hindus.. who call Shivlinga, the sign of God, with black stones🤬......

But still people are still trapped in Dhongi Baba's trap.
Believe in power, not In statues

Humanity in the humans are more important than unity in the religion. 🌺

Still, I am proud of my Sanatan culture because we take the name of God and offer milk as soon as we break the coconut. At least we don't blast bombs in the name of God or tie up wild animals and kill them. Jai Shri Ram.

Even today, when some trouble comes to the log temple, I remember God..that's why I remember God. People like you... they face trouble, God comes to them, or God gives them milk, they feel pain.
How much do these people themselves give to the beggars...why do they give 200 rs per ticket to your movie...where else do they eat God's food or listen to their evil..
Irony is paresh rawal is fighting election from bjp

I am empressed  nice movie scene 👌
Paresh Bhai is magnificent in presenting style beyond expectations.. ASHOK, Tihidi, BHADRAK, ODISHA

Best movie of    O. M. G.

They can also make comments on Hindu religion because they know that Hinduism is a tolerant religion. Someone should show us that his neck will not remain where it is today Jai Shree Ram 🚩🚩🚩
Chutiya director hai...movie ka. Utna guts wala rehtha tho sab religions ko questionas puchnaa tha..utna seen nahi hai usko.

Solute this director

Worst movie ever seen, where God has been criticised on every aspect....I wish I would never see such bullshit movie ever again in my entire life

This film gives a social massage 🤠

Total bakwas

God bless you
He has done the war on Sanatan Dharma through the medium of film, he has fought in secular valleys which we have not seen, which we should understand.
Supar

But this was only one side of the coin
The point is understandable but some hypocritical people spread their knowledge everywhere. What did Kanji Bhai say wrong, I thought everything was right.
Make a similar movie on Islam, make a similar movie on Christianity, Hinduism was targeted in PK and in that movie also HINDU is INTOLERANT. The day we become intolerant, we will lose our ACT.
You have made such a true movie that it will not even bother a human being, sir, the moment a human being becomes a god, the moment he reads it, he will understand that all human beings are animals and those who will go to society, Jai Shri Krishna.
paresh rawal g muslim he makes majid anywhere but what should he do?
Hinduo ka mazak bna hai iss movie mein....I m very disappointed....shame Akshay...

I am a staunch and proud Hindu - and I completely agree that these temple priests and holy-men have used religion for their own selfish gains.

Well done💯👍
Hinduism is most uneducated religion in the world_

Is movie k baad Paresh rawal ki avaaj alag hi ho gyi thi

2.5k dislike people are the curse for india. Please understand religion is humanity

Still people believe  god is a labour He is waiting for money  and gold  to do something  for youI love this movie because  its questioning  many lobbys they selling god for best price

Which country uses mosque money?
Darm, what a God you are, you don't give me the power of anyone, I don't know what you said, you say that you have passed, or you have not passed me, you don't give me anything, but you don't understand the compulsion, you want to be a girl. Why don't you say anything and look at me, what do you believe, how do you feel like God, not only Saini, everyone is alive, love is not returned, let's go.
How kind we hindus are we waste 90% water and 10%milk on god but never slaughter animals on our festival . Dudh bahana khoon bahane se lakh guna acha h . Acha hua ye scene hindu pe tha agr muslims pe hota to movie ban ho chuki hoti

Sometimes religion
Why mock only Hinduism? Masjid ka toh kuch kaha nahi? Saale fattu

Wroste movie everThey do not know on which path they are walking, they do not know what is the arrangement of the temple. I have not seen beggars outside the temple till today. And even if he saw, he did not see any monk or temple priest threatening him. How do they pass the story, request the government that such films should be investigated, what is the fact that they have. And the people of this country are anti-sense, what bollywood people serve to them, they take it wow.

Har Har mahadev

Jai shree krishna

Jai Shree Ram

Yes true total waste of milk....

Namaste sir, donating to the poor is a very good thing, but do you know why Ashutosh Bhagwan Shankar ji's Abhishek is done, you kill your mother and father and serve the society, so is it right? All are the children of Lord Shankar, the second thing is that the material used in Abhishek of Lord Shankar is gathered in a plate and is not wasted, it is made famous and told to the people.
If you have a problem, that's fine, but don't make fun of the idol of God. And you felt so bad that whoever directed this movie or whoever worked on it has given so much to the poor, and the second thing is that if you go to any big temple, you will be reminded of it every day, that poverty should be there for everyone. Yes sir, everyone gets the same food. Please shoot in such a way that we forget our religion. Jai Shri Ram.
Iss video ko 40 lakh se b jyda logon ne dekha h..bt i m sure ki 40 lakh m se 400 logon ko b ye akal abtk nhi aai hogi..ki vishwas or andhvishwas m frk kya hoti h..bs jo pujari pandit bole vhi kro..chahe vo kuch b krne ko bole..bs chutiya bnte jao

What a scene! What an acting! What a movie! ❤️

I am belive only science

Donkey, if any Muslim talks about his religion, then log in. If you want to save money, then watch his movies. Proud to be Hindu🚩🚩🚩🚩.
in other things if the producer uploaded the Full movie omg next days the movie is band also many people reports in the movie then it&#39;s band . in this movie Hindu gods very badly showing insulting to Hindu religions faith .

this movie producer begger so  2012 released movie till now not uploaded in YouTube coz he is greedy person .

This is wrong, the Hindu religion has been defamed, I don't care about any other religion. How much will your dam show?
Dirty hero of dirty movie 🐒
Kanji bhai, if you give the milk to the temple, you will get that milk and give it to you in the form of Parshad… the priest does not give it to you from his pocket. It is written that I am in a cold place...for example science has said that there is water in this place, then why are you drinking water in a glass...why are you not drinking it from the air... .Well, a stone is a glass to worship God….And that is about atheist, Swami Vivekananda was the greatest atheist after all, he wrote Gita and told the world about Sanatan Dharma…. ... God, but to see him you will have to do penance and sacrifice, you will do it... God is not there but we have not reached him...

Sahi baat nice movie salute hai movie k writer aur director actors sabko
Charanamrit is not wasting it distributed in people

Forget Gaya in My Heart
First of all, Dharm and Seva are not the same thing. They have different dimensions. Secondly, what is shown here is the mismanagement of a temple premises. The milk washed off of Shiva lingam is served as Pādūkā.

Mostly in the temples like Somnath, kedarnath, badrinath no one is allowed in main hall of temple And also there is not a single chances of wastage of milk because the milk which is used for shivling , given to the devotees in the form of panchaamrit This thing only happen in small temples where everyone is allowed in main hall which should be stop because God has not given you milk to waste it in any matter whether it is love , faith , respect , etc .

fucker
Omg ke director ko salute jo inhone itni himmat dikhaye

god is not great

All bwood have become anti hindu s why dont they make film on masjid this nd that they are not following any culture they are leaving freely are they really happy in there big expensive house divorcw is common affairs is common in their life this movie is nothing but to brainwash our young minds ancient hindu people are much happier in moral way and almost they all were  use to belive and love god not like this... bucause we hindu are tolerating type of people thats why we tolerate and sit and watch and enjoy all this  ... a time will when everthing will be gone everyone will be gone... hare krsna.🙏

This movie is made only for the religion of Hindu people or they are playing with their religion..but no one will say Hindu if I say that this movie is not made for God…do we not have any value for Hindus? There is no faith in Dharma, no one who is in Dharma has distributed this video or movie.. once others watch the movie banker in Dharma or the full roll, this should be done and then let's see what they say to you.
Hayee goosebumps aagye yaar

Cant believe he played babu bhaiya yr

Fantastic movie ever

No question on Shanatan Dharma
In hindu dhram there is mostly lived those people who live their life in darkness means in endwishwass like they worship false gods and do there potential in wrong ways.big example is here even in there holy books like geeta, and most older book VAID says that &quot;there is no painting of God&quot; even this why they not follow them....

This is a film, they don't care about anyone's feelings, they just want to earn money and name by making films, the rest is nothing, no one cares.
Service to humanity is service to God, no matter how you do it, keep good feelings in your heart, do good work, there is something good in everything... then only the sensible person accepts it. If you believe in it, then it is not God, it is a stone. Someone before us has also said that it means there is God everywhere. If we take this to mean that even a good human being is a form of God.

Paresh Raval who makes movies, he too is wasting people's money. When he starts partying, he must be giving away thousands of rupees. He also gives money to the poor. When did he give power to the poor?
Hindu muslim me ladai karane wale ko thook dalo sab ak Insan hai jai hind

What to do, you are right. But my mind does not believe that without offering water or milk to God. Yes, this can be done. Along with God, you can also give to the poor or the needy. You should be proud of yourself. .You can give to both.
Sir please upload full movie sir pls sir request is there
Bhaii ye movish kha milegi
A Muslim is calling the Shivalinga of Mahadev, the God of Gods, as a stone and is telling humans not to offer milk on this stone and he made a film, you supported him, but why did this Muslim not make his Mowgli on his mosque? He defamed Hinduism. You Hindus have supported it, you have not raised your voice against it, films like this will be made in the future, you cannot do anything, these Muslims want to degrade the Hindu religion, you people clap and laugh and do nothing. can
Shiv linga is not a stone. What a derogatory remark made against the almighty lord Shiva!..truly shameful!I am surprised how come a BJP diehard supporter agreed to play such role in the movie.

If I want the link of this movie, please let me know.
These terrible films should be released in more quantity.
Only bollywood people roast Hindus, rest Muslims don't roast Christians.
Jai shree krishna ❤️
If Paresh Raval wakes up, any Muslim actor will create a ruckus.
A-chha... hai ye film hai.. bhagwan par ban hai... . When Allah or Jesus comes to heaven… then they come to see my brother live in the court… Hindu Gods and Goddesses are fake… they know that they will not come…

These &quot;Lallulal fools&quot; People do not know that in real life the milk offered on Shivlinga is not wasted; rather all that milk is later fed to the people in the form of Charanamrit. (In which Lord Shiva's blessings are received later) First do some research, then let's make a film and print money. Namaskaram 🙏🏻🙏🏻 Om namah shivaay 🕉 Hare Krishna ❤🙏🏻🙏🏻
Shivling's old stone is full
Just make a movie on temples because Hindus remain silent and only on mosques, see.
Best Movie OMG👍
O

More blindly Hindu is hote hai
NYC

On

Or if this movie is made on Islam then you will have to know what will happen, Paresh Rawal's fatwa will be issued, Hindu wow Hindu.
Why always play with Hindu religion?
The person who realy inspire me is his friend

If a Muslim had made this movie then perhaps Hindu religion would have been in danger but here it is the opposite.
Most powerful scene!!! And the thing that Kanji Bhai said that a beggar should not enter the temple, I have seen it with my own eyes, I have a temple of Saibaba, there sits a spring Buddha, but the poor man was sleeping in the compound of the temple. The trustees/priests of the temple did not like it at all that the stone was thrown out to the old grandfather in the spring, I saw that he came inside the temple to worship the father made of stone but the stone was thrown out to the helpless old father in the spring of the temple. Sai Baba never taught that temples and trusts have been opened in Sai's name and only notes are printed in his name. (She is talking about the Sai temple of my area, not that of Shirdi) What kind of religion is this? It is written in the Gita that God is in all four, so why do we make an idol out of stone, worship it and live while we are kicking the God of human life? Such people will never understand Bhagwat Gita. Helping the destitute by serving the human being and when that destitute person gives blessings from the pure heart then you can understand that you have got the blessings of God.
Ap log to serf kelony waly morte ko sajde karte ho wo ap na Morty nahe bana sakta hai to ap logo ka kia krega

You are making a wrong movie on your religion, your religion is weak, which religion is your wrong religion?
That's the dead body
Sab andwishwash hai

John said to the beggar in the spring of the temple that no one else has given birth to him.
Please Please Please read my comment. You will find logic in it.Okay. So money is invested in building temples and doing rituals and rites etc. And yes that money can be distributed to poor to feed their stomachs. But one should not forget that in original vedic culture it was the duty of the temples to ensure that no one should remain hungry. Even today ISKCON feeds lakhs of people with nutritious Prasada. And that doesn&#39;t go into gutter. Ofcourse we offer milk but that is not wasted. It is fed to people as Charanamrita of the Lord.(proper hygiene is maintained)Infact life in olden days were focused around the temple and it was a cultural hub too. All people were fed prasadam and that too irrespective of cast.(The cast system was distorted to some peoples&#39; benefit in the modern times).But today these fools and rascals are wasting the same money on luxurious hotels and big malls, restraunts and bars, and due to these nonsensical things it is a total waste. One can very well argue that this money can be distributed to poors instead of wasting on cinema theatres and other places of materialistic enjoyment good for no one. Now here you do not show any mercy to poor. But when point is on temple then you talk of mercy on poor.In short Nature is a machine that is working on the directions of God. All living entities are part and parcel of God. Our constitutional position it to give devotional service to God. Instead of wasting so much money on nonsense places of materialisitc enjoyment like the malls and hotels and luxurious bungalows it is better to build Bonafide temples so that there is cultural growth and no scarcity to anyone. That was true vedic period. All citizens were happy. They grew spiritually. They were wiser than we fools

By making Prasad of milk, everyone is told... milk goes in the gutter, that is bad management of the temple... give 1 liter to Shivji, give 5 liters to the poor, but it does not mean that you give milk to Shivji. Nahi.Samje bhai, this is the film Mr. Hamari Sanskriti has been presented in the wrong way..which is wrong..Om Narayan
<b>🙏🙏🙏Is this film open to anyone today? No evil has come to anyone.
Great movie

Exception Baba Ka Dhaba🤣
the truth

It is fashionable to insult Hindu verses and Bhagwad Geeta and by doing all this Paresh Rawal joined BJP. Double standards. Those who support Ram Mandir join BJP for their own benefit by insulting whenever they want.
Nothing is better than building a big temple, only the heart of the person should be big, the one whose heart is pure and true, God resides in his heart.
This is the film we should make, we need these things, be a human being, God is with us
Why are you always targeting Hindu people?🤔🤔🤔
You are insulting Shivalinga by calling it a stone.
Hindu religious sentiments have been hurt in this movie which is completely wrong.
𝑹𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕
Jhakaas😇
Speak truthfully...we are the God of our people, we have to help the poor here, we have to show them that we are special...we have received more wisdom in the Muslim religion...to make us... .How can a goat be made halal...they say that they have killed the innocent child of God.
Film City Etna bada nahi h jo pure barahanand ke Malik bagvan shiv Ko chunauty de rahe ho

Right

Good

India ki sari masjid  or church tod kar waha hospital school anathashram garibo ka bohot bhala ho ga par log samajhte hi nhi

👍 Jai Jijau
right

Bollywood always promotes and spreads anti-hindu propaganda at a great extent. PK and OMG are the movies particularly triggered against Sanatan Dharma to proove us bad. But for your kind information, nothing happens like that shown in the movie. The milk offered is drunk as Charanamrit. Also the beggars and poor people at a temple are taken care at their best and are not ignored as per the movie.

God also has a wife, had he yrrr......
Water is poured on Shiv Linga, not milk at all
This way bollywood is insulting hinduism

Kanji bhai one no.
😂😂

😂😂

Paresh means Parah IshaMeans superior God and idiot is questioning his creator All sounds Alice in Blunderland

We people Store the milk

How to download yrr

In this movie why the  sanatan Dharm is targetted ?? Why not Christianity or Islam ?? 🤔🤔🤔Nothing is black and white in India. People need to understand the evil intentions of bollywoodBloody urdu film industry bollywood Boycott Bollywood !!!!😬😬😬

Too good

This movie was not released after 2014...
Advocate Saheb Jiwant, who spoke like a heart, please feed the mind
Right insaniyat nhi honi hohiye bus👍
In today's time, there is no such thing, only BJP will get angry.
Everyone watch this film and donate even a single rupee in the name of Ram Mandir.
Wow paresh rawal ji
Hand down most boldest subject came out in Indian cinema

names of 6 sons are manoj, vinod, binu, arjun (chedi), bheem( labedi), and shiv shankar( chamur)

my remaining six brothers are son of maa devaki and vasudev

Good

Oh my god film you tube par do

Nice movie

You Are Right

Shouldn't I make a movie like this?
Parash Rabaal sir ji is absolutely right
himmat hai to hlala pr movie bnao

Agr ye movie ab release hoti to andh Bhagat ki gand jal. JatiMandir bnva rhe h modi ji aakhir fayda Kya h mandir ka

I love this film this film deserves Oscar❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Meri soch to movie se pahle hi aisi thi

India need more films like OMG and PK.

God sent Corona to fight his case.
This movie would have faced boycot calls had it been released today. There would have been multiple FIRs filed. Especially, UP Police in particular would constitute a team to investigate how this has hurt religious sentiments and practices. Paresh Rawal and Akshay will never dare to say any of these type of things again. This is the reality of today.

How dare u paresh rawalU can&#39;t call got a stone

You bastards, you anti-religious people, how many people have you done good to?
Jo bhagwan ko jayda mante h vo andhe ye movie dekho

No offense but If you worship a God that cannot feed himself then that is not God...because God is not dependent on anyone, and doesn&#39;t need anything materialistic from anyone

Boykot this flim

Boycott This Movie,It is rumour,It is the fault of false management of mandir that they made naali to gutterAsal me shiv ling pe doodh dalke use collect karke as a Charnamrit sab gareebo ameeri ko dete hai

Blind devotion exposed.
Manna Na manna apni wish ki jab tak mistake 0 Na ho jaaye nahi nahi ja sakta i.e. here God has sataye 9
What you people call Murti Puja is not Murti Puja, it is Virgha Seva. If you feel thirsty, do not go near the pit to drink water. There is no place for water vapor to drink. This is how you can see God. Even after meeting God, do not drink your sorrow. There is also a place to express. Same on you Hindu Picture. People of your religion call Shivling as black stone or you all are with them.
Why is Hindu culture always maligned?😡😡
Mithun ji acting is very good I love it

Aise hi mahim me ek dargah hai samandar k kinare jaha log doodh waste karte hai. I am muslim but i felt bad.

Even a shri ram hi says in upanishad book that don&#39;t work ship human or stone , worship only one God

No amount paresh rawal
madarcod paesh rawal
But We should not drink milk at Shravan(july and august ) month.

Hidu birodhi bollywood
The shivling is actually made up of a alloy of metals like gold, silver, lead, ect. When you pour water, milk, etc, the liquid that forms is actually healthy to be consumed. This shivling thing has nothing to do with religion.

I was very happy to know that our film artists not only talk about love but also talk about our religion.
I was seeing Devo ke Dev Mahadev and there Bhole baba said ki agar koi baccha bhookha hai tab tak doodh mat chadao pehle usko do then come to server Shivling. And when we offer something in water it goes to animal living in water thy r fed from it.Agar ek bowl milk se apko itna problem hai ki hungry ko de sakte the plz first serve a hungry and money u spend on luxuries usko sacrifice karo and then offer milk

142 beggar and dog
Correct

God is worshiped in statues these days
What happened then BJP was not in power
There are a number of Ghatiya movies
You are lucky that you have made this movie when congress was in power ..... aaj Teri aukat na hoti iss type ki movie banane ki

Jai Bhim
In Islam, whatever is given in the name of Allah, it is basically given to the poor, fakir, mosaferon, orphan etc. Study Islam under yourself, your Roshni is my Roshni.
You will die a very dirty death Paresh Rawal. There will be hundreds of doctors around you, yet you will die in agony.

It's true but it's harsh
I love u girl

Masha Allah
You have the right to say this in Islam.
Don't worry about it
Just as the temple land has been mentioned in it, it would have been great if it had also shown how Zara and other lands have been embezzled and lakhs of people are living landless and homeless.
Sir send this movie
Hii

Movie why not get it
Thank you to make this type of movies I liked it very much    it revealed truth

Movie achi h
Movie name plz
This is propaganda by others against only Hindus And see even PK

Of course you said it right
Why was the film not distributed on Muslims?
In reality noone will clap

Advocate Ram kumar

It is true that Shiva himself does not want that people should remain hungry and I should be breastfed.
But no one will raise question to off shop and on shop that how may hungers are roaming along the street.But no will question to the buyers inside Levi&#39;spuma adidas or etc that how many are roaming nude around their locality.But no one will ask to ambani that how many are living inside slum houses around antila.That Kaliyuga. !All the question will be asked to the temple trust.Anyway but don&#39;t follow kanjilal in life or else you will be finished.

Paresh Rawal's words are true.

Indina realign Iz also wrong

Good zbrdastttt
Why is Hindu religion targeted the most? It is in the movie that Hindu religion is always targeted. Why????
This was a deliberate attempt to attack our Hindus religion     am not blind are you?

Good movie

I really support like this movie,because India is one of the great developments country but indian people are 80 percent   are really thay are leaving blind life, In all religions,  if thay avoid like this blind trust  sure india will number one through out world. Sure...

Please upload oh my God full movie please in YouTube 🙏🏿🙏🏿🕉️🕉️

It is worth saying that people will give up alcohol, will not go to school, everything can be closed, but blind devotion is not in the temples and idols, it is in the blood of the people in our country. It is bitter but true.

very good story

This scene proves that mega temples like the one being mentioned in this scene wastes not our time but also food , water and especially milk , which we Indians , especially Hindus , considered to be a liquid equal to Amrit , as in a liquid which can grant you immortality

If this word is spoken to God then we will know what religion is after all.
Why you hypocrites, you will raise questions only on Aamir, you hypocrites, Paresh Rawal, Mithun, you will not say anything on Akshay Kumar, you hypocrites from somewhere.
What is left behind Hindu?
Hindus are targeted every time by terrorists.
It was not said that a black stone had fallen on Shivling.
There is no picture of Eswar's party, people do all this for their own benefit.
Even God, the doctor, has to be sold for justice.
Kaala paththar😡😡😡
B
You must have made a film, it must definitely be Kathua, the person who is opposing the offering is the first one who goes with a bowl 10 times in a day to beg, there is no mosque for a beggar.
Nice

OMG this film is earning at the box office. How many poor people, how many hungry people have you fed with this money? Tell me, if the dead are buried in the land of India and we start farming, then we can support 8 crore people. What did you say to us? This year the hunger of 8 crore people is increasing. Why don't you open doors for all these people?
Rite on perfect for paresh rawal sir

Watch Mandir Ki Ninda Bollywood's Akshay Kumar
The beggar of your temple, how many have heard your best line 👏👏
What is the problem of the people….I understand that people want milk on Shivling and what is the problem….Apni apni shardha vishwas hai….why are the religious sentiments of Hindus known? What did you log?......
Even today people have this superstition. You don't know how much loot is being looted in the name of God..everything is wasted 😭😭🥺
Kehenaa baalaakaa arth koi buddhimaan byakthi samajhte hay
Full movie please...

All these dogs see only Hindu temples.
Bollywood is a place where people waste money by giving money in the temple...Inka bss chale to nashedi bna de usta bollywood.
Paresh Raval's dailog, any Muslim actor speaks loudly about the society.
No god ,no bhagwan,no Allah; exist in the universe. only ur work (karmwaad)exist.

No bhagwan, no god, no Allah; exist in the world.only ur work(karmwaad)exist.

The right path to attain God has been shown in the film, but the eunuchs of Bollywood are not strong enough to make a film even on Halala.
Whatever be the religion, it should be human.
And have we taken the contract to feed the beggars? That beggar doesn't know how to work hard himself???
We who buy milk, we who anoint Shivling with devotion, we who spend money!! Why are these people itching!!!
I believe straight!!! The one who offers milk on Shivalinga has earned money through his own hard work. Now it is his choice what to do with the milk he has bought!!
Now the beggar that Paresh ji is talking about in this film, he did not work hard in his life, that is why he is begging today!!! They say, help the poor beggars!!! Hey, the poor beggar does not earn money by working hard for himself. Could earn, have other people taken up the contract of raising him??
Maaaaassssst such wisdom should be given to the foolish people of India.
Good pares rawal
Tum flim walo nahi society will understand the concept of spirituality.
Everything is fake and 99 stores are mine. And brother, whatever you eat, you will see it.
Does God exist as long as religion exists?
Seeing all this is useless.
It is good story

Hahahahaha

Now you don't know what your children will say when you are in a mood and you will fall ill. Your children will say, Papa, why did you put so much money in the poor house?
Great movie

One thing is not true in bollywood, no matter how many religious films are made, SB mainly shows the evil of Hindu religion, why does not it show the evil of Islam or Christianity, SB shows the wrong benefits of Hindus being secular.
India Wala Hain he lante

Indian Nhi manege 😂
Nice movie

Looks like Yogi Adityanth being questioned

Haqeqath
Serving man is serving God..🙏
The beggar talks about the temple and says that he has food for the court, tell me how many poor people have food...😛😛😛😛
I love Hinduism for that. Agar kisi aur Dharam ke paakhandon par kisi ne esi chot ki hoti to ab tak Charlie Hebdo ban Chuka hota.

Galatians are the ones who dislike people who serve food to lakhs of people every day in temples and churches. Unfortunately this is not shown in the movie.
FunFact: Paresh Rawal is A BJP MP

👉Service to Men is Service to God! Ostentatious religions!

I love paresh rawel  ..well said

God say Ya Allah...Ishwar. Say. Yes. God. The Father is all one. But if you worship God as an idol, you are doing something against your religion. Because ved. Bhagvatgita. And it is not written in the Bible or any religious book that you should worship idols. Rather, it is written in the book of Har Dharam that there is one God. Ishwar is one. Allah is one. There is one God...there is no idol of God.
Who will tell you this?
I put milk in my hand.
Who became a beggar?
Sabadhani hi Sadhana, our culture is being spoiled by our people.
G o

I really feel blessed to hear the intro music...

If it's a bday then you will waste more than 2 to 3 pounds of cake....how much food will be wasted at the party? Sale ye filming artist...who did not give even 1 rupee to anyone but only for the sake of God.
Right

Nice

The world is full of colors every day...😥
Jai Shree Ram. Didn't understand Sanatan. Pouring milk on Shiv Linga leads to complete destruction. Where the milk was milked and someone was born. How to read videos
Paresh Rawal 🔥🔥🔥🔥 sir❤️❤️❤️
The truth is that God is dead, I don't see him, I have written the Geeta, he has written what seems to be happening, I don't see him.
In today's era, the aim of all the religions is to run the market. Believe it or not, more than 32% of people's employment is linked to this.
Level

When and how will you meet the devotee?
God made us we made religion I believe to be truth religion

Being a lawyer it is very hard to comprehend his arguments 😶

I wish people's eyes were opened after watching this film.
There are so many temples in Barahmanabad because the entire income of these temples belongs to the Brahmins.
Paresh Rawal sir you are great

Always movies are made against Hindu religion.....y u don&#39;t have guts to make movies on other religion and show there truth.....

Very nice movie
Jai sewa

Jb tak sote rahnge ye aise hi mazak bnate rahenge ........ please be awake

Hey brother, this is the biggest business in our country, which is called temple/mosque business, which has probably been going on for centuries, it should be stopped somewhere. God is not in any temple. If God was in a temple, then when the Vedas were asked about God, the Vedas would say 'Nahahiti Nahaheti'. Why say? This temple-mosque politics broke the country.
Aisa sikh dharma m nhi hota h And I proud to be a sikh

I don&#39;t believe in God there is no god every where

Siddheswar maharaj be like yogi Arvind nath

This is the against of hindu

Very bad

Hindus won&#39;t like this movie

That's right
If you talk about humanity, the one above will be happy, call us by any name you want ✌️🙏
You fool, stop insulting Shiv Ji... don't make fun of our feelings... Mahadev forgives you for being a fool, and you will turn into dust.
You are the one who has insulted Hindu religion the most... by disrupting any topic with just a few people, you are giving the bad name to Hinduism... pleaseeeee.. I have equated all the religions and that is how I want people to be. Save religion... Jai Hindu...🙏🙏🙏
Amazing

My favorite movie

No problem in worship hindu gods unless they are not made out of stones or mud ... and i dont think anyone can create the real image because if u look closely all the hindu gods images or status look same ... sorry but thats the truth

We don't want to get sick of such movies.
Full movie plz
Everyone should know about humanity and helping the needy!! No religion is greater than humanity, God or Allah doesn’t need Milk , candles or Chadar its all rubbish and idiotic, people should be helped instead and the real taste of life, is in helping the poor people!!

Thank you very much. Best wishes for Independence Day.
Good movi

Fact

The name of religion or how many motherfuckers did Baba loot?
Bhagwan Tera bhala kare

Nise

If India was such a country, how much better it would be.
If we have any trouble, we will make a movie in comparison to Allah.
The truth of India's culture has been reached, lawyer.
In Bollywood, Hindu Gods and Goddesses have always been targeted. Why don't you remember this thing, when you all waste money on alcohol in the evening, you waste it on cigarettes, you also give bread to your brother. It seems that you waste money by eating chicken. You can work in 4 pair of clothes but you waste money by buying brand new clothes but don't remember. For the sake of money, Paresh Rawal insulted Shivling by calling it a stone but when Molvi Or asked the priest to give just one line with so much love that when Hindus protest tomorrow, he will be able to tell them that where did we tell the rest of the Dharma too, or else give the whole picture, why Hindu Dharma was targeted.
Kamaal bhai doglepann ki agar kya hindu ke aisi dharma apne dharm aisi movie banaye sab khush or koi sabre dharma ka banaye vaishkaar h log pk ka rodh ki jabki us movie me sb hindu dharma k h movie banane wala b hindu hi lekin usms sirf target. What did Amir do when he drank milk on Shivling? Why did any Dalit Muslim Sikh Christian believe that he got angry but in a very clear manner he said that he is happy or happy woww movie to brothers this violence or If you blind people can say bad things to the people of your religion then you can say no to others because of their art, then they will work for their status.. because here people are born in different industries.
I believe that this milk and money should not be offered. Why does God need it? It is better to give it to the poor. But should the entire Hindu religion be dragged into this? Why is this stigma imposed only on the Hindu religion that these people believe in superstition? People have named Hindu religion as business. Why are films made only on Hindu religion? I found PK movie very bad because of how Mahadev has been portrayed in a bad manner. If you make a movie then make it on every religion, why do people target only one religion?
Brother, all of them have been playing with the Hindu religion since years.
God becomes happy more quickly than by breaking blind faith or by helping the poor. And I have felt this.
From birth till death of man, religion and God, in every work, keep making him perform rituals in the form of auspicious or inauspicious. Why is this God so hungry? What could he lack? Is there really a God or is all this cosmological pretense??
Nice

If this film was made by any Muslim then we would not know what would have happened in our India...
This is true, there is a lot of wastage in the name of religion. If the same milk money is donated to a beggar sitting outside, then I am not opposing God. Yes, one should have faith. However, if you offer even a flower to God, your wish gets fulfilled. Tell me. so much milk is wasted
Aaj here presh rawal nafrat failata h.Aaj ye movie bni hoti to deshdrohi bn jata.
Nice video

I don't understand, every time there is a fight…to every fight, a stranger will do the same to the greedy, or someone is crying in sorrow, to give to the greedy…why are they greedy? Who can do this...how much can a stranger do like this...someone can't tell why they have to earn...they do 200 kms, drink 100 worth of liquor and buy flour for 100...this is from the market. I will never see them again...
All THE RIGHT

God is there in this, human beings help each other, nice movie
courts never control. this system nagar nigam s are uncrolled never work for common people always busy in tax collection.  always busy in offers welfare    please check nagar nigam patiala

beggar problem. in all India who will care

Tell us how much money is wasted. No one says about giving alms to someone or serving a poor person in return of our unnecessary expenses. Every time when the matter comes to our Hindu Gods, we always give our respects to them but do not talk about them in return. Yes. I am not saying that we should not leave you in the name of religion. This is true. But I am not denying this either. All I want to say is that stop such blind beliefs which are being spread in the name of religion. An attempt has been made to tell through the medium of the film. We also need to be aware of the way the air conspires to defame our Hindu religion. Jai Shree Ram
Nice

Paresh Rawal is crazy 😠😠😠

Oh have mercy, please pray for me.
Only Hindus can tolerate so much...Hindu is the best tolerant religion...if anyone made such a movie like any other religion, the director and producer were shot in the back.
Had this film been released today, you would have wondered at how many places there would have been riots...how much it would have left a mark on the hearts of today's people...and why is this happening, it is a matter of thought.
God does not need anyone, not even any temple. He has been built by human beings as per his wish. God himself has not said that means he is supreme here. 0.00000
Why bollywood always targets only hindus......sabko ek jesa target karo

Great scene..Paresh deserved national award

This is our dharma, now you have banned it, see which disease will come and that disease will come.
There is no movie
God never exist. We have created.

Paresh Rawal ji got the opportunity to make OMG by raping him from an old film, quite interesting.
Religious beliefs have been around for centuries and are present in all religions, but it is not right to insult religion and God through films like this.
Akshay Canadian Kumar selling nationalism and communist agenda in a hindu rashtra.  And still Khangressis calling us &quot; intolerants&quot;.

Thanks Really nice

A Hindu came to my place and asked me why do you drink the urine of a gay man? Brother sir, because of its many benefits, I also gave him a drink of gay urine.
everything is ridiculed
It's the right thing to do, brother, I don't want to tell you that I am a stranger to you.
Wonderful
Today I am here and I want to watch a movie.

Does any Hindu say that he has learned a lesson or has given us some milk to make him gay?

Anti religuous film... brahmins are above all...even god

Superb sir, those who spend money in vain will learn a lesson.
This scene is wrong
Beggars are surrogate they come to if you are rich that is the truth. Don’t believe. Either Rich by money or rich by brain

When I spoke, no one listened. When the film was made, everyone clapped.
Brother, I have seen this poor movie but my family prays to God so much that they keep praying to God every day. Please friends, the condition of your family is such that they pray to God every day. Please brother, sister, your mom, dad, parents. movie dikhaiye bahut mast movie
