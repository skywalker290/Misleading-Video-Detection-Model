I wanted NZ to win that match

Newzealand deserve that world cup 

<a href="">2:40</a> That Wicket Was Just 

And I have to say it. Why aren&#39;t we still using guptill? One of the greatest t20 and odi batsmen ever don&#39;t care what anyone says

The worst thing about this for me is before the era of t20 and the super over.. if an odi was tied it went to the team that lost the least amount of wickets. I dont agree that the team who scored more boundaries should win the game because its a lot harder scoring runs without boundaries by running between the wickets so i think get rid of the most boundary rule and go back to who lost least wickets in the original innings. Or just have another super over that would have been so much fairer

The most unluckiest run out ever 

There should be another super over.....

2019 icc world cup final in lords and 2022 qatar world cup final in lusail . we just wintness the greatest world cup finals of the two greatest sport in the world

Request for icc please make highlights atleast 25minutes especially a legendary match like this

Yes

Williamson after win :Williamson after lose: Respect for that guy

Nz is always unlucky

If martin guptil use his mind and smartly look to run only 1 then it might be 2nd super over

Whata  match

Kane Williamson 
Ben stokes wrong

Umpire&#39;s decision is wrong for that over throw. if it may not be happen blackcaps may won

Nz deserves
iam was lucky i watching in stadium

<a href="">5:30</a> that was cheating 

Lance klusener in 1999Ganguly in 2003Sanga in 2011 Heartbreaking 

England didn&#39;t deserve this World Cup  the over throw rule is dumb af, it cost New Zealand a well deserved world cup win

Ab to nafrat ho gayi hai 240 aur 241 number se 

<a href="">5:11</a> that one six and that overthrown by mistake at <a href="">5:35</a> that mistake causes the loss for NZ

I dont know why but i feel bad for NZ .. this team deserves a world cup from years they are trying but badluck evertime they got knocked out

I like ben
Nz deserves the WC

Zidane cursed ItalyWilliamson cursed England 

As an Indian even i feel for newzealand they deserved the win 

I think New Zealand should have nominated Guptill and Kane Williamson. Why Neesham was there? Williamson plays better than Neesham and is above him only as top order batsman

Q

W

Whenever I saw this match,It makes me feel thrilled and excited for next ball though I know who won.Jofra archer

Newzealand winner

I am happy for England because nz defeated India

Ian Smith mouth shut...useless kiwis.any team wud hav pulled this this off except the Kiwis  cudnt get 5 off 3 to win a  World Cup

Moral of the story:Boundary &gt;&gt;Running

Observe field se

Stokes icc ke niyam ko toda kyuki bat se bowl ko Marne ka adhikar nhi hai.icc niyam ke tahat stokes out tha.

<a href="">5:11</a> If the catch was taken then Nz would be win this match

If Guptill didn&#39;t attempt to hit the ball and had stayed in place, he could have received a wide, but the chance was missed.

<a href="">6:54</a>If Boult didn&#39;t bowl a full toss in find of yorker they will win. Feel bad for Williamson

Anyone after üáÆüá≥Vüá¶üá´ 3rd t20 
<a href="">7:48</a> Guptill has chance wide ball. If he didn&#39;t hit

The most exciting match of all-time

It was for New Zealand for real.

England did not win. period

They should send a ken Williamson and rose Taylor

England won the world cup by their luck otherwise the cup was for New Zealand

If stokes and buttler were not in this match england were losing this match

Buttler and stokes partnership is into super england

Ian Smith comentry  is just wow in final

India should learn a lot from NZ how to play knockout matches. India was not defeated by 241 runs in the final and NZ won the match by taking the super over.
Just imagine buttler made a mistake at the last moment and nz win the cwc

Last ball of super over...OMG that would have been a wide ball men OUTSIDE THE LEG STUMP....Just needed some awrness

Both teams made equal runs in super over

Luckiest persons are those who watched this legendary match live Ô∏è

Who is watching this final in 2024

HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024
But

New Zealand lose because of boult and guptil

Nz win the cwc2019 easily but because of martin guptill miss field and can&#39;t take a songle two run new zealand lose shame on you guptil

Cheating from stokes

The most thrilling match or a final!!!!!!

Tie rule was very bad.......It was not justice one for New Zealand....

England  great team
What a bad rule... Very sad for NZ best team in the world in my view really they deserve this world cup 

I am seeing this match highlight in 2024

Bad luck for newzealand

I am a Bangladeshi. But I am crazy fan of New Zealand, even I love New Zealand as my country. My only dream is to live to see a World Cup in the hands of Bangladesh and New Zealand. (Sorry my english is so week).

There won&#39;t ever be another CWC final like this...

<a href="">

Buttler innings is underrated

I fell very nice for ms Dhoni due to that dangerous run out bu Jos Buttler to Martin Guptill

England shouldn‚Äôt have won that at ALL. And 4 years later they call the Aussies cheats!? Those bastards. But great job not feuding with England New Zealand, you‚Äôre a true gracious sporting country.

India and NZ both scored 240 in finals.   Only thing newzealand succeded is their bowling.

Although being indian it still hurts me  for newzealand team. when i imagine this 2019 final.

Boundary count champion 
Ferguson should have bowled that super over. He was both economical and wicket taking as well.Boult was quite expensive.

2019 world cup was way way better then 2023 world cup

New zealand win wc 2019 beimani ki hai england ne

New Zealand deserves this world cup they did so good at the final

Luck is kind to the donkey.
Rip for those people who sleeps early

same target india gave to australia in cwc 2023 finals

Brain structure coronavirus

What a match

The fact that this got a huge english casual audience should tell you just how entertaining this game was in a country for which cricket rarely makes the front page

Why 23 wc highlights isn‚Äôt here

Ok let&#39;s accept ICC ROBBED NEWZEALAND. 1. ben stokes controversy2. rule of super over tie3. if these match was been played 3 yrs later ben stokes could not have played last ball when eng required 2 in 1.

How two teams are equal run why England win

This is one of the greatest final of WORLD CUP HISTORY

2019 world cup was more memorable than 2023 world cup.

Iss match ko live dekh ne ka ghamand hai 

Greatest match I have ever seen

Most underserved world cup.. no wonder the  English always rob

My heartbreak as an Indian fan after the 2023 final pales in comparison to what NZ fans must have felt after this final. Geez

Best ever World Cup Final 
World Cup win england but heart win newzealand 

<a href="">5:33</a> Wasn&#39;t actually Stokes fault but it was really unfair for Nz and the reason they lost the Match

Agony for nz

Actually there has to be another  super over 

One of the best games of cricket ever and also the most unfair. They should&#39;ve shared the trophy.

The even closure scores of 2023(241) and here 2019(240) .Fact batting first teams lost this wc edition especially this 2019 wc is so hard.

Anyones here ? after the 2023 world cup!!!

This is still the best match in cricket history after another world cup  but iam sad NZ didn&#39;t won this and this year they lost to ind in semis 

Please see my UNIQUE shorts related to Kane Williamson,God Of Cricket and Shane WatsonYou will not REGRET IT!Please support me<a href="">

THE MOST LEGENDARY MATCH IN CRICKET HISTORY..I AM LUCKY I SAW THIS LIVE
My wish is newzealand must win so unlucky. I&#39;m big fan of newzealand team. Since Stephen Fleming Era he is cool and smart captain

Undoubtedly best odi world cup final ever 
Who is here after 2023 ODI World Cup final?

I missed this match but this was marvelous

If anyone wondering how England won. In this Cricket World Cup final, both England and New Zealand ended up with the same score after 50 overs, leading to a Super Over. The Super Over also ended in a tie. However, according to the rules at that time, the team with the higher boundary count during the match and the Super Over combined was declared the winner. 



In this case, England had a higher boundary count than New Zealand with 9 more boundaries, so they were declared the winners. This rule, known as the boundary countback rule, was quite controversial and has since been changed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Now, if a Super Over ends in a tie, it will be followed by another Super Over(s) until there is a winner. This change was made to avoid the kind of controversy that arose from the 2019 final.

Long live ODI Cricket !!!

After india 240 in world cup Final
Boundary Count Champions 

Bad rule, boundry counting

Won by 0 runs     New Zealand

2023 : India played against Australia in their first match, then Australia won2023 : Team which will play against sa in their first match will win the world cupThis trend is valid for 2023 and 2027 world cup, Mark my words.

I wat hed thiscmatch 100 times

<a href="">5:38</a> Ian Smith : CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS (CRAP) ??

I am wondering what will happen tomorrow after seeing this 
Best match in cricket history at the same time worst dessission by icc

Watching this the night before the 2023 world cup final. This will forever remains the greatest cricket match ever played.

Biggest match in the history 

I couldn&#39;t understand new Zealand needed 2 runs from one <a href="">ball.new</a> Zealanders got out when they were tooking 2 run  .so match again tied because both teams made15 runs in superover.

My point of view New Zealand win this

We all know real winner is NZ

Unfair matchNEW Zealand deserved 
Undoubtedly the best final ever in history of ODI WC. what an edge of the seat thriller it wasÔ∏è

ENGLAND MADAR CHO*** HAI

As a fan of Ken Mama, I could not get over this trauma.

NZ actually deserved itThere should have been one more super over,The rule of Max boundaries is just unfair and bullshit.

This game was like the F1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2021. Hamilton deserved the win, Verstappen deserved the championshipNZ deserved the win, England deserved the WC

2019 Cricket World Cup Final Eng Vs Nz2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Priz Hamilton vs Verstappen2022 FIFA World Cup Final Arg vs FraCant believe i watched perhaps the greatest games of the sports in 3 years

I fail to fathom what&#39;s the meaning of life in the eyes of Williamson. The life, that never completes his favorite chapter. After all these years, the Kiwis have smelled glory but never touched. 3 semi&#39;s &amp; 1 final since 2011. The nicest of the Fab 4 is defeated again. The smile stays, the pain grows. Why me? Why us? Kane walks off with his troops in sorrow. Chin up, something better is always written for all.

This match still hurts

Guptil last ball jaane deta to wo wide tha

Who is here after seeing the semi final

Man, boundary countback was not a good rule. They could&#39;ve gone the IPL way and had another super over. Winning just because of more boundaries is not sportsmanship, it&#39;s sheer disrespect of it.

what a match, i had enjoyed back then

Kane Williamson&#39;s coach Johnston interview-I remember Kane coming back home from that heart-breaking World Cup final in 2019. He was utterly gutted. I wouldn‚Äôt say he was pretty hollow, but was numb for a long time. It wasn‚Äôt because he was angry at the loss ‚Äì it was just difficult to process that strange game. New Zealand didn‚Äôt lose the game; yet they lost the World Cup.

Stupid decision by ICC. Pure cheating by England.

Anybody here ? After 2023 Newzealand semi final defeat ? ... Kane

Boundary count champions

New Zealand wins

<a href="">7:49</a> if only Guptil didn&#39;t play that ball it was a wide ball anyway

This is not lose for NZ and Win for England

What a bad luck for New Zealand 

And here we are 4.5 years later for 2023 WC with India vs Australia final at Ahmedabad. Can India end the trophy drought from 10 years?

Nz played immensely Ô∏èÔ∏è
We Indians consider NZ as a winner

Legendary match ever 
This machat ws new zland

 2023 England is struggling from asthama and so many excuses

True winner newzealand but umpire worst decision gave extra run for England. Heart broken moment for newzealand especially kane Williamson

The robbery

Yepp, the best ODI ever !!!

Shitest Game of cricket ever saw in my life, Started hating cricket after that game.

Wow Ô∏è
I was only 9 only nine years old, but I still remember this match. That was a legendary match

Number of fours are you kidding me, terrible rule

Now we know why ben stokes is called bhenchod

<a href="">5:34</a> thats so unfair to new zealandthose 4 runs shouldn&#39;t have counted

new zealand robbed
This Was My Life&#39;s first match that I watch live with interest 

Neesham 
idiot umpire dharamsena

Just came here to watch this after NZ&#39;s ousting from WC23 Semis. This Game was legendary.

NZ deserved this game, better luck 2023 .

England,the most over hyped team.

ben strokes did that on purpose

England was deserving or not we dont know but yeah in 2023,England is out and tomorrow, Ind vs NZ is going to be played.And that&#39;s Semi-final 

Why 1 run was counted at te last ball (<a href="">6:10</a>) although he was runout? Because in new zealand super over he got no run at all at the last ball (<a href="">7:52</a>). He was also run out but no run was counted. Can someone explain?

But in 2023 the history is changed India defeat all teams.

Ye cheating thi

Uboy to 15 run nilo eng jitlo kibave?
GOAT Match

<a href="">5:26</a>Who thought it would be a camouflage six.Love to see Stokes in this situation. He&#39;s the best man fitting in there. Love from Pakistan

What we are seeing today, who will see tomorrow and what will be seen tomorrow, who will see tomorrow (this is the pace of life, some are finding their own, some are missing their own), we have become so busy in our lives. I don't even know how much our 4 years have gone by
This is the worst way to win a world cup, what a horrible rule of no of fours. Terrible luck for new zealand, they deserved truly.

Resting the right leg on the left toes by crossing it over the left leg and striking the Dumbells in front of left thigh, keeping the arms straight.Returning to the position of attention 3-4. Repeating steps 1 and 2 with the left leg on the right toes.

You won&#39;t see a final like this because it would be obe sided as India is way too strong this time.

I am so sad that I slept through this 

I watched this with my grandparents in India and was so ecstatic when England won. It was a memory to cherish with your loved ones. RIP Grandad! Happy I watched it with you.

Chills ahead this 2023 wc

We should have a rematch for the trophy. I still can&#39;t digest England being declared a winner 

I always appreciate the English crowd, they live up to my expectations everytime.Not only they support England but they do appreciate the other batsmen as well, love it.

This child will never live like this world again.
Cheater icc cheater england

After watching condition of England in 2023.     Just realised never do bad with a good person 

Achha hua nz haar gya salaa
That 4 run was painful

14th july 2019 (Sunday) Who are see this match live Ô∏è (Thrilling match) A unforgettable match in cricket world cup History Ô∏èÔ∏è

This is called the final . The greatest of all times

Icc and your useless rules . England won because if boundaries.  So in the end if the result is not coming out in super over and winner decide by the boundaries,  so why you guys want batsman to run a wicket 1 run 2 run or 3 run. If match in the end is decided by the boundaries so all the players must hit boundaries.  Icc come out useless logic and rules .

That time England was just lucky...coz this time in 2023 wc the Nz&#39;s were thrashed them very badly n showed them their place...actually the fact is that the new Zealand team are way better than them...

Legends Watching On 2024
Hello sir good
Credit for ben stokes 
The biggest bs i ever saw, England didnt deserve it, anyone telling me otherwise is an idiot

Stokes The Most Cheat PlayerEngland The Most Cheat Team

Give the commentator a trophy. 

One of the greatest worldcup final in cricket history Ô∏èÔ∏è

Newzealand was the more deserving winner first that boundary that eng got during taking a run from stokes bat if that would not have happened Newzealand would have won the match without even going into super over

New Zealand could have won the world cup if there would be a  better rule and New Zealand is a world champion

Karma England karma... England also won fifa world cup by doing rubbish things..here also..

I was laughing when benstokes innocently ups his hands nd says this is not my fault

The most seat edged thriller and nail biting match i had ever seen in cricket history 

Game was great but there should be another super over.

England and New Zealand: main jhukega nai sala

i remember watching this, the wimbledon and the British gp all at the same time. Brilliant day from sports.

New Zealand are the most unluckiest team england won it by unfair rules Tbh and now england is humiliated in 23Cwc

who de fck watch this &quot;sport&quot; and why?What is this shit?

Due to unfair decisions england won

After 4 years ,  in 2023 England is out of wc and NZ is in top 4 .... This is cricket

England dumped out of wc

Shame

shame on you

England never deserved this final win. Because:1. Stokes wasn&#39;t given out when he obstructed the field clearly, that accidentally provided 4 runs to the team.2. How on earth can a final winner be decided on basis of boundary count. England were just handed the cup rather than New Zealand winning it on merit.3. England collapsed badly when they were made to bat on wickets that weren&#39;t quite helpful for batters. In group stages, they were battered by Australia and SriLanka on tricky wickets. It was only against India they won whivh saved their world cup. In final also, barring Stokes, Buttler and Bairstow, no batter lasted long.Now its 2023, England have been humiliated in the world cup and their batters collapsed on Indian pitches as they thought they can score 300-400 every single match but they are just flat track bullies but shit their pants on proper wickets. They are now in danger of missing out on 2025 Champions Trophy Qualifications which seems very likely now.

Legend match ever
After watching England performance in 2023 world cup

Dharmasena cost new Zealand World cup..... A complete idiot

Spirit of cricket? Not there. When is suits England they are fine, when it doesn‚Äôt they complain.

The most fucking moment of cricket truly unjustice there was a home advantage for england so nz should be the winner but cricket was discovered in eng its their rule i will never accept eng have won a wc legally

4 years.... But still thriller and goosebumps

Craziest match Ever 
Man this match was something else.. MAN THE RULES IS SOOO BAD, HARD LUCK NZ .. HOPING TO SEE IND AND NZ IN THE FINALS  its really suprising to see England now at the bottom of the points table.

Watching when NEESHAM run outs against Australia in last over in WC 2023

Nz was much deserving team. Finally Karma has hit back 

Wth that wasn&#39;t a 4 ben strokes got in the way

Why didn&#39;t they do one more super over?

Who is here in 2023?

Most unfair trophy given to England, and karma is back as of now staying on the foot of other teams in worldcup 23

Eng cheating krke hi jeeta first cwc
Let me place my comment here ...&quot;This match both shocked and shaked the world of cricket in 2019..Back then I was in 10 grade witnessing this live the next day headlines on the newspaper were &quot;ONE TEAM WON THE CUP AND OTHER WON THE HEARTS &quot; this was a very controversial and at the same time very thrilling match..&quot;I am posting this comment during 2023 world cup where NZ,SA,AU and India are playing really well...So far India üáÆüá≥  in indisputable New Zeeland üá≥üáø is on fire and South Africa üáøüá¶  is making world records with 425+ runs and Australia üá¶üá∫ is Crowling too

Guys in <a href="">6:09</a>, it was 2 from 1 ball and it was a run out too so why was that 1 run counted as it was a run out ?? But in <a href="">7:58</a> the same thing happened, it was 2 from 1 ball and the players ran once and then got run out so why wasnt that 1 run counted this time ?? Someone explain plz

How times have changed 

No one is winner ok 

England are out of the 2023 world cup lol

What a thrilling match in the history of WC odi.....

NZ deserved the WC. Eng just won due to some rubbish rules. Eng took away what was actually NZ&#39;s. So this year thay are getting the payback.

Today England r out of cwc

Here after England got knocked brutally out of the 2023 Cricket World Cup 

England&#39;s present or we can say poor performance in WC 2023 clear all doubts that they didn&#39;t win the 2019 WC infact England was declared winner of the match. (156/10 ve Sri Lanka)

Nz didn&#39;t have this win in their destiny , first the four extra runs from stokes&#39; bat then not able to make 5runs from 3 balls despite hitting a huge thang over mid-wicket by neesham.. and deciding the winner on the basis of boundaries  , its all about destiny

That was unfair match in tie match england won world cup

As an Indian when I was a kid I thought new Zealand were the true winners

All time best match cricket no one beat tha match awasome  match bad luck nz loss tha world cup true winner nz team

Ben stokes is on of the greatest cricketers and cheaters as well

ICC ki ma ki chu**t,Puri highlights nhi de skte
England played way better than New Zealand,no way this was unfair for New Zealand

In this year 2023 india  host world cup and india win

<a href="">5:33</a> this was the game changer

Most unfair match in world

It should be decided on sixes not on boundaries,,,

The most valueable Robbery by EnglishmenAfter India&#39;s colonialism

classic wc not like fkin 23

Falsely england win

England's mother's pussy was filled to six counts and then lost by 0 runs. Meaning, the dick of your mother's pussy entered your ass. English mother's pussy is cheating.
Well done England , what a cheating on home ground , good message spreading from  so called mighty UK 

worst game rules ever. Pathetic.

That guy literally touched the ball with his bat by running through that side. His intentions were clear. L England W Newzland

Actually new Zealand wins in the super overBecause if super over ties then the team which have taken highest wickets Considered as winnersNew Zealand 241-8England 241-10New Zealand has taken 10 wickets and England has taken 8 wickets

From champions of 2019 wc to now bottom of the table in 2023 wc  karma of being boundary champions

Tit for tat  guptill run out ms dhoni in semi final and he also runout by runout 

Newzeland jeeta ta empire b and he ty or aj usi chz ki saza ha k england Apne se kamtr teams se b har rha h 2023 ma Allah ka insaf ha

Newzeland win kia ta cheering se england jeeti ti

New zealand deserve the win

Stokes my Favourite

Match to super over mein v draw hua tha 15 runs fir keise englnd jiti..or ekbr hona tha superover

Chit game win new Zealand I from üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥
New Zealand win

Ben Stockes always use unfair means. He once got out while trying to stop ball from hitting stumps with his glove andhere used bat to get overthrow 4 which was unfair. It&#39;s what Englishman have done from start of time.

This has been the best match I've had
Commentary was in God mode

The craziest game of cricket ever played.

19's semi-final was very sad
Nz also scored 15 runs, then how can be england declared as winners?

23?

What a match it was‚Ä¶ neck to neck competition, felt so bad for New Zealand bcz of that throw, otherwise they would have won it

Sorry for NZ

New Zealand deserved it .. BUT IT WAS THE MOST LEGENDRY MATCH I HAVE SEEN. I WAS SO LUCKY THAT I SAW IT LIVE

If Boundry count rule is cheating then NZ reached SF due to rain &amp; Cheating PAK won against BAN, SA, NZ, ENG, AFG {beat 3 big teams}NZ won against SL, BAN, WI, AFG &amp; SA {beat 1 big team}

New Zealand gives extra 4 runs hitting the bat

Super over is tied you idiots 
<a href="">5:32</a> karma hits  back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I
It was a great blunder from the umpire who gave 6 runs to the batting side for that throw from Guptil that deflected to the boundary. The former ICC elite Panel umpire Simon Taufel said as per the rules, the umpires should have awarded England five runs instead of six as the batsmen didn‚Äôt cross when Guptil released the ball from deep. Unfortunately Kumar Dharamasena awarded one run extra (6 runs total) that costed Newzealand worldcup. It is to be noted that the umpire was successfully reviewed twice in the same game.

We have to give credit to Archer as well...he has held his nerves very well at the end ......

Yeah England won by cheating

Boundary champion 

That is such a painful loss, I feel even more bad for the kiwis than India. Icc should&#39;ve have let them both share the trophy instead of making up such a ridiculous rule.

My hear for Nz

The last run out
What a match !!!!!

I&#39;m probably the only English person with this view but I will never recognise this World Cup win for the following reasons:I personally believe that a dead ball should be called when the ball accidentally hits a player&#39;s bat as he&#39;s running. The reason batsmen don&#39;t run when one of them deflects the ball away from a fielder in the process of running is because they know it&#39;s not fair to get runs like that, so it&#39;s ridiculous that the umpires have to say &quot;sorry, there&#39;s nothing we can do but give 4 runs&quot; when the ball goes all the way to the boundary off a running batsman&#39;s bat.Deciding a World Cup final(or any game) by the amount of boundaries scored by each side is a complete nonsense.Lastly and most importantly, the umpires erroneously awarded England 1 more run than they were entitled to, so New Zealand should&#39;ve won the game by 1 run*.*Umpire Kumar Dharmasena&#39;s decision to award England six runs following an overthrow boundary in the final over was criticised by former international umpire Simon Taufel, who said it was an &quot;error in judgment&quot; and a &quot;clear mistake&quot; by the on-field umpires.Law 19.8 of the Laws of Cricket says &quot;If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be: any runs for penalties awarded to either side; the allowance for the boundary; and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.&quot; As Stokes and Adil Rashid had not crossed at the moment the New Zealand fielder threw the ball, England should only have been awarded one completed run in addition to the overthrow boundary. Dharmasena later admitted he made an error.

Who y‚Äôall got this year? I think it‚Äôs gonna be either Nz or India

So if Nz just did 1 run at the end, it would‚Äôve been another super over?

most historical match in cricket history

Where is this england...pls come back in form.

On boundary count and how they know England won instantly, it‚Äôs all set up, its just entertainment like WWE 

As an Indian, L New Zealand

Great revange from NEW ZEALAND  5th oct 2023
Such a types of nail bitting game only possible to see in dream.undoubtly most memorable game in my life ever

Ben stokes is perfect finisher

Incredible match but nof fair with nz one more super over should be done as that was tied

England won that.  Luck by chance..  Stokes bat helped him

Cheater England

Cheaters

Very dangerous match

But l believe new Zealand won the match

they both scored 15, how did england win

This is the GOAT match no doubt no debate and i am lucky to watch this live 

Believe it or not, luck favored England team the moment ball was redirected towards boundary by ben stokes when he was trying to save himself from being run out. Also, the super over is tied, this stupid rule of winning by hitting more boundaries is now gone. Winners cannot be judged by that. And it took NZ&#39;s unfair loss for ICC to realize that. I so wish this was changed way earlier before the beginning of the tournament.

What a match 
Ben Stokes proves that he is the G.O.A.T. Love From India üáÆüá≥

Most thriller world cup final in the History of cricket  ! 

Best final
Biggest scam of 2019 part 1

Can&#39;t believe that 4 years have passed 

Dharmasena ruined it with awful umpiring. Worst of all time.

I&#39;m very sad for Kane Williamson I want to see him with holding the world cup

Why icc not upload cwc  2023 Highlight 

2023 operationÔ∏è
Hope black capz will loft their odi trophy this year under kane captaincy 

Most interesting WC Final in the cricket history 

No one has won the previous O, D, I World Cup, it will be known this year, everyone knows what happened, yet the commenters are requested to guess who is expected to win this 2023 World Cup.
Goosebumbs match
Who is here after the 1st match of WC 2023 

Who is here after the 1st match of WC 2023 

Agony for New zealand
NZ deserved that

I was supporting New Zealand with my heart, this really hurt, but we are winning this 2023 ICC WORLD CUP

that 4 overthrows in the last over from stokes&#39; bat could have been overturned. NZ had the decency to call a 6 when the fielder&#39;s foot touched the boundary ... england should have reciprocated by taking back those 4 runs. NZ will always win the fairplay award they always play in the spirit of cricket ... (mankading supporters won&#39;t understand)

In this match new Zealand was win

I am watching this match in 2023 oct 12

One of the greatest ever Wimbledon finals was on at the same time 

Why ICC don&#39;t upload highlights of 2023 World Cup matches?

2023 still Watching..... 

Where men cried

I am from new Zealand üá≥üáø and feel very sad we were robbed 

Omg as an Indian I always heard that India vs Pakistan match was best but when I saw this live 4 years back omg this was the God played match both England and New Zealand have similar chances to win but yea the luck was with England so they win. Both teams played really well

England you are not winner, ICC gives their trophy to you the thieves, and beggar, the whole England country have not the potential to play against Team India.

Fake world cup

Maybe it was the beauty of lords 

New Zealand deserved it so much

SIR BEN STOKES......HADDSS OF TO YOU YOU&#39;RE THE GREATEST CRICKET PLAYER......&amp; YOU PROVE EVERY IMPORTANT MATCH.......ONE MAN BATTALIAN <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc"></a>

whose after nz win over eng in 2023 world cup?

Martin guptill should leave the last ball of super over and it would be wide so ..... newzealand could win.

fours pace bowling good fielding alround show. hail the lord!

Controversial win
Can you imagine the moment when he realized that he is not going to make it and could have waited for another super over 

It was not tie in super over ?? 15 and 15 ??

Now wait for Pakistan v India in the finals 4 years of hard work and here we gonna and pak try to redeem their selves

England is a true cheater this match belonged to new zea land

real champion = always champion

The umpires gave six runs for overthrow but it was deflected from bat

Revenge Loaded 
Most unluckiest byes ever seen in life . .. from the hands of ben stokes.... 

No  match can beat this one Ô∏è
New Zealand loss the match but win the respect from several countries as they don&#39;t give up even at the last moment

If Trent Boult had caught Ben Stokes, the NZ would have won at that time.

Pure luck for Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø......
getting goosebumps even after watching now ! What an incredible match and can&#39;t be witnessed such a match in lifetime huh..

The legendary match ever i see in my life and am lucky saw this match live 

Final * comes with a asterisk because scoreboard error in which the other side actually won

Dharmasena gave 6 runs on a bye...what a corrupted game...better give wc before the tournament starts

Scam 2019...

<a href="">5:34</a> game changing scene

Why they not uploading this World Cup Highlights

Rules were made to make Englund win atleast 1 wc

Evergreen fraud England....just made a new rule and declared england as a winnerchor sale

Newzealand should be winner

who is here after new zeland crushing england

It&#39;s an final of the centuries  always remember. I am lucky watch this final live. it was amazing match

New Zealand deserve wcc2023!

&#39;Guptill is always gonna make it&#39;                                                                    - famous last words

Totally crushed England today 

Revenge taken
This is so wrong for kiwis

Who is watching after 2023 wc 1st match and new Zealand won 9 wickets just now. let me know by liking

Who is here after new Zealand üá≥üáø  Win by 9 wickets with England

Aaj badla pura kal liya newzealand wlo n 
And England lost the inaugral match of wc by 9 wickets against nz 4 years after 

Just saw this match....  wowwwww what a match.. And meanwhile watching eng vs new 1st wc match 2023...newz on hunt revenge

1975-2015 wc won. 2019 gifted

That stokes four shouldnt be allowed

England are super winners

Really require steel nervesto watch live

Number 1 mach in cricket history is this

Things were too sketchy. People are not fool. New Zealand won the match without any super over. 

Ô∏èüáÆüá≥ will win
It&#39;s not fare  because I not think that who hit more sixes can considered has world cup but it was world cup it&#39;s not a cup of tea  Why ICC can not make the rule that who hit more four that will win the Match. Hence The World Cup Final Was Fixed 

Best world Cup final match of all time.

Watching this match highlights today . Because the World Cup is starting today and the first match is between them.

Best final in WC history

I was praying for NZ loss

Newzealand deserved such loss 

What a game OMG
<a href="">5:42</a> FBI barge into the warehouse where the POTUS is being held as a hostage, there are many bloodied bodies of drug smugglers and militia on the ground, they see Ben Stokes removing the binds from the POTUS wrists. FBI FBI RISE YOUR HANDS ABOVE HOUR HEAD SO THAT WE CAN SEE THEMBEN STOKES : I AM Mi6 AGENT, PLEASE DONT SHOOT, PLEASE DONT SHOOT

Britishers always cunning 

Sad for kane mama

Today 5 oct Eng vs newzelandWho should watch RHA he
New zealand lost here <a href="">7:41</a>

How many time I watch I always enjoy it. And today I will watch these two teams match again <a href="">#cwc</a> 2023

this match is eyewitness of bowler,s ability to defend a mid scoring match.And make this match thrilling.

Feeling sad for newzealand team and Kane mama

<a href="">

Again they&#39;ll clash in the 1st match in the ICC MEN&#39;S CRICKET WORLD CUP INDIA 2023. This rivalry between England vs New Zealand is getting amazing .

This match was amazing  between England vs New Zealand final in the 2019 cricket world cup. England 241 in their 50 overs and New Zealand 241 in their 50 overs. Match Tied. However England won the match by the boundary count. And they&#39;re the Champions of The ICC MEN&#39;S CRICKET WORLD CUP England 2019 final..

It still gives me goosebumps after 4 years passed!

So, here we go again 2023 WC&#39;s 1st match hope kiwis gets their unfinished job done today pending since last 4 years

How the match has been tied dishonestly to the English, what cricket has invented to do today is to become the world champion, this is why we have to give a super over again and again.
Cheating with nz

Life is unfair at times. New Zealand losing less wickets than England still lost the game on boundary count

If you ask me, New Zealand should win this,

I suddenly watched this and I realises tomorrow is start of CWC23  just how fast the night changes

Worst Rule...  There have been two World Cups since <a href="">#2011</a>, but the memories of 2011 <a href="">#WorldCup</a> is still fresh in our minds &amp; Hearts. üáÆüá≥ 

Cheter England
<a href="">1:51</a> clearly ball over the high but umpire had other plan 

This is whats called match fixing. Perfect finish for a final.

Agony agony for newzealand 

<a href="">7:45</a>

Ab tak  ke behad ghatiya  tarike se world cup jeet eng ki  5 saal ho gaye per abhi tak bhul nahi pa raha real winner on my side is NewZealand with heart.

One of the greatest rivalry in cricket looking for tommorow opening match eng vs nz that&#39;ll be awesome

That catch drop of ben stokes by trent boult and that overthrow 6 runs cost new zealand

IPL is no match for this
England vs Australia 2019 ashes England vs New Zealand 2019 lordsThese two matches we never forget 

Most thrilling match I&#39;ve ever seen. The real winner was nz

The best cricket match ever.

Kiwis deserved this match to win because rules are shit 

Karma hits new zealand they won semi final with runout and loss final with runout

Revenge day tomorrow . The rivalry continues....

It&#39;s been four years since England won the World Cup and four years since New Zealand won our hearts.

Unfare for newzealand team

A champion without defending or chasing the score,,what a rule

New Zealand 241 runs with 8 wickets. England were bowled out for 241 runs. So it is clear that New Zealand has won the match

New Zealand opened well against England, New Zealand should have won the match. But England was the favorite team for ICC

The result is that the team with more Bondaris will win the match. What a joke

New Zealand Would take revenge from you in 2024 ...Wait for it you England cricket ...

England won by luck ben stroke bat came in middle of the throw and it went for boundary . If that was not the scenario then newzeland would  have won the cup

Agony...! Agony for New Zealand üá≥üáø

Great effort by ICC to keep cricket alive in england

Nz

Feeling sad for NZ 
<a href="">7:55</a> what if ball slipped from buttler&#39;s hand.

England played in difficult phase on lords .2nd ining in lord not easy to bat . difficult condition.

4 years gone still can&#39;t forget those matches something goosebumps 2019 cwc

‚ÄúEngland have won the world cup by the barest of margins, by the barest of all margins. Absolute ecstasy for England. Agony, agony for New Zealand.‚Äù - Ian Smith

Bren stock ... 2012 for Be izzat against WI. And 2019 izzat against New Zealand
best finalworst rules
Newzealand win this match that extra runs decisions is not corect

For me - Newzealand was the real winner of world cup 2019 
wtf how

Just think what if Virat Kohli was in the place of Kane Williamson after umpire give 6runs in over throw 

and the rule gets changed today 1.10.2023

To be honest this should have been New Zealand&#39;s World Cup

2023 Anyone 
Betichodd England cheaters

Trent Boult having nightmares...the catch he caught but went in boundry line

No will you for super  over 
NEXT PART ON 5 OCTOBER

What a unlucky day for newzealand 

Or hamary bowler 18 ball par 48 defend na kar payah 

Uss din super over ke final bowl per Agar Kohli Strike per hota tab Wo jeet gaye hote  2 runs taken out hi given
Because of this thrilling final match, 2019 world cup is my favorite cricket  tournament. Second is of 2011.

Best comedy  as boundary count England won the World Cup  . They should give one more super over . This is the first time in the cricket history counting the boundaries to choose winning team England not deserving this World Cup shame

They should give one more super over They are giving World Cup to England same like offer

Actually England not deserving this world cup I don‚Äôt what kind of rule to win england

Last bowl me down the ground    six lagana chahiye tha martin guptil ko

England üá¨üáßüá¨üáßÛ†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†ÅøÛ†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†ÅøÛ†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø can&#39;t able to win against Italy in final 2020 and you are saying salty to indians, can&#39;t win CWC final convincingly and you are saying salty to indians. Your nation&#39;s hooligan lads destroy everything, starts racial and verbal abuse to dark colour ones and Italy civilians and you are saying salty to indians. Btw this world cup your English lads are gonna vomit in between match when temp. will exceed 40 degree + and the scorching heat will ultimately burn your skins. There is nothing kept in cricket as well for you hooligans this year. No need to send england players to india for 2023 wc  because then it will become health and safety issue for them. Ever heard polar bear basking in between desert just to avoid racial controversy

What a match

India lost vs new Zealand due to worst batting .india lost t20 World cup due to worst batting..but now india lost austreliya 3rd match target 352 it is not big only rohit n kohili shreys contibuted surya rahul Sundara waste i hv fear now batting in middle order no dhoni no yuvaraj sury not keeping his form

If ball don&#39;t hit Ben stokes may be there was not any four run

Wow

Ben stoke jasa all rounder nhi ‚Äã‚Äãhay
Commentry 
This World Cup should given too both counties they deserve it 

New Zealand  Lost World Cup.Bad Luck.N.Z.L Final Match Tied.
Love both teams,but New Zealand deserve the world cup

Surely &quot;Match of the Century&quot;

NZ was saved from becoming champion only due to the mistake of umpires
real winner of 2019 cup new zealand

Neesham my fav batsman 
That was sad after watching it from years I still feel bad for nz

New zealand deserved it

What A Match

Agony Agony for Newzealand

New Zealand 
That day was special tho..On one hand eng vs nz epicOn the other handA few kms awayDjoko vs fed left us in awe

 2023 world cup winner  üá≥üáø new Zealand
How Eng won ? The super over was Tie although 

This year for New Zealandüá≥üáø

I really dont understand why they granted 4runs for the overthrow that came from stokes bat while diving to the crease.. is that a rule?

Actually england not win this match... It&#39;s tied... So equally share both team.... As series tied they equally winner both team... Same as 2019 wc final

Neesham 
Greatest robbery of all time.

England never won this

Newzealand was real winnerWorst rules of ICCWorst final

Worst final ever

None is talking about Neesham performance

Maybe the best of the best world cup in history of ICC Ô∏è

Can we just talk how umpire made 2 wrong decisions in the final

Its how comic is that Smith said &quot; whoever scores more runs in the super over wins&quot; and it ties....barrest of all margins

This was absolutely wrong.... When ever a super over is tied then they should have a reserve day..... 

This match is full scripted.

The english Cheats it should be another super over

To think that if the stakes were not so high Guptill would have generally reacted sensibly and leave the last ball as wide 

Shame on ICC

Last Wc When The Players Are Legendary  And in Form Kane Williamson Is Injured This Wc 

It is four years since then. But as a newzealand fan I feel the heart break till now. You gotta fell for newzealand. But hope this time Newzealand finally won the WC 2023. <a href="">#BackingBlackcaps</a>

England wins by cheating
Watching in 2023, It Still Give Goosebumps..

Practically england won the matchBut newzeland won billion heart of cricket lovers 

I think that&#39;s not fare another super over need to the decide to the winner 

Why do you fight this 
In super over also tied.

Don&#39;t worry guptil is gonna always make it, Hurts

I don&#39;t even care if it&#39;s fixed it was such an awesome script and acting

4 years on.. one of the greatest finals ever witnessed

Sad for NZ Ô∏è

So badluck for newzealand.. they deserve the trophy...

Newzealand and south africa. They deserve to win but choke out in the end.

This is cheating for newzeland

How can a team be soooooooo unlucky  Nz deserved to win it by all means

I think the winner should not had been declared by the number of boundaries but should have done another super over.

4 years iam grade 3 in live match tv

That free boundary by stokes bat at non striker end (extra runs)  was Nz&#39;s bad luck.  So sad for nz. We lost in semifinals but we all wanted to see them champion.

Fix match tha

Kismat se jiti England deserve to New Zealand hi karti thi

EN
last ball was a wide, if guptill wouldve just left, sad

Whos going to win this world cup 2023?

Boalts bowling in super over was villain‚Ä¶..

there must be another super over if super over is going to be tie. we cant decide winner based on boundary in Cricket world cup. One of the most embarassing moment for cricket and its rule. gotta fell sad for NZ. one of the most unluckiest day in NZ cricket.

Best final in the history of 50 over world cup it&#39;s unbelievable how the  stokes had delivered

Utter bullshit...

Brilliant highlights of the most incredible game of cricket. Can we take a moment to admire Ian Smith&#39;s commentary. It was 

This will be remembered for generations across borders. Sad that cricket is dying i Englad, what a tragedy

An excellent match with both teams fighting to the end, but the best thing about it is the whinging from Indians, because apparently they&#39;re the world authority on cricket 

NEWZEALAND LOST BY 0 RUNSENGLAND ( WON) THE WORLD CUP BY 0 RUNS

What a silly rule - as a South African I believe another super over should‚Äôve been played until a legitimate winner was crowned

Mostly only Indians and Pakistanis commenting 

Cheating

Not a fair result for Kiwis as they have faced two back to back finals but couldn&#39;t lift the world cup

Live dekh kr boht dukh hua tha

World cup chor england

New Zealand deserved the wc. I still think to this day that it was an unfair match.

Greatest match of cricket ever ever I&#39;ve seen

Ben stokes
<a href="">1:20</a>. Clear noise
Getting to this highlights for goosebumps

I am here Now (2023) Love this Match ,Historical Match

2023 and Still giving goosebumps 

The hype should have gone for this sport instead of game of thrones final season

I saw this live , and experienced adrenaline rush  , I was wondering what my condition would have been if Indian team was at this place  then it would have been another level of excitement and nervousness too

Totally deserving NZ .

It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times I watch this I will never tire of it . One of the greatest finals in any sport

4 years ago I watched this match live but it still gives gouse bumps 

When the commentator said -&quot;by the barest of all margins&quot;, we all meant it

The greatest match of all time in any sport.

I am great
Stokes can easily hit the last ball to the leg side I think it is scripted 

Wow brilliant 

<a href="">7:55</a> commentry &gt;&gt;&gt; Harsha bhogale&#39;s careerAgony agony for NZ 
probably one of cheating world cup

England won 

<a href="">7:54</a> Martin Guptill deserved the treatment as he broke millions of Indian fan&#39;s heart by getting Dhoni runout in semifinal.

<a href="">6:04</a> What if Stokes had just walked a bit forward and allowed the ball to go wide

Ben
English players are cheaters. Whole of England is cheater. They are cheap people. They should be banned.

England won for <a href="">5:30</a> moment

Everytime you watch you think that blackcaps were robbed

<a href="">

Both lost to Pakistan

One of the best final match 

Best World cup final match ever  Very very lucky and thankful to God that I have watched this match live 

Guptill run out dhoni and he got run out by jos butter (who was an dhoni fan)Ironic isn‚Äôt

The most interesting and unfair world cup final.

Those here to refresh memory of past winnersÔ∏èÔ∏è

New Zealand deserved to win 

Who is the Ripley of 2023?

Legendary match 

What a Game 
Best six Neesam under pressure 
Liam Plunkett the unsung hero of England

By throw 4 run is shows the real destiny decided by the lord

It's too big a tournament to decide which boundaries are too unfair.
One Man Army Stoksyyyyyyüáµüá∞
In the ashes they lost ben stokes says that they not want this type of win done by wrong method but in wc 2019 he did not say this because it was a major tournament

Ben can do any impossible thing in a cricket match ‚Ä¶ what a match what a player

BEN STOKES!It will declare The Greatest All Rounder of All Time in CRICKET HISTORY

Most legendary match which was held in final match this is cricket 

This is not fair and not a good rule of more boundaries team will win if  Super over tie

How is here in 2023 

Wow 49 million viewers in youtube fifa world cup only below 10 mollion

What a match

Archer overs
Cricket won the match...

One of the Best match ever happened on cricket field 

Why was there never a DVD release for this World Cup? The only way to rewatch it is these far too short videos with sound quality issues. What happened?

The most epic 50 Over World Cup Final.

The best one day match I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶maybe the best game ever 

I m speechless how to express my emotion for new zeeland and goosbumps of watching the end!!!

<b>Thanksgiving to England team for the sweet revenge of MS Dhoni&#39;s runout of Semifinals..</b> 

Ben stokes is english version of yuvraj singh üáÆüá≥üá¨üáß

OMG 2 balls 3 runs new Zealand bad luck missed easy win 

Santner is not try to touch last ball he touched last ball atleast take 1 run I thought they win

Every time watching  this match makes me cry ....Indians deserve this final behalf of kiwis

new zealand  was away from a few inches

Engkand won the World cup  by Barrisive of Margin Escastic for England Agony For NZ

And today ben stokes came in odi and YT show this this first video 

The cricket is very bad!

cheatersssssss england
Because throw was keeper side but stokes bat touched    the ball

England won by cheating

I am repet this match 15 times never  dis ponting

ENGLAND CAN DO ANYTHING FOR WINNING.. SHAME ONE YOU

Stokes is hero

This is the one and only match, where you can say that loosing team was not loose.

Fucking hell i love england wowwww

Goosebumps

This more boundary rule on which England won the world cup should not be followed. One more super over should be done.

Worst final decision ever in cricket history
hi friends
You cheater Icc, actually eng never won that match.

Absolutely This Final  Was Blasting 

That day my uncle passed away I will never forget that day 

New Zealand were more deserving cuzz those 5runs were biased decision and they selected winner on boundary count what the f**k both team scores equal no one won tbh ...

Fix

Those 5 runs

No wonder why does this video attract me whenever i am on Youtube!

The commentary of Ian Smith is just fire 

England won the World Cup but New Zealand won the hearts of all cricket lovers.
I was there. I come back to watch this every now and then. It‚Äôs just so good

I want to watch this match &amp; listen to the commentary of Ian smith again and again in disbelief  !!!

The greatest thriller match to have ever occured

Boult 
The crowd is so quite

I watched all but one of England&#39;s 6 previous defeats in the final of the World Cup and Champions Trophy.  Several missed opportunities there spanning 40 years plus.  They finally did it 

New Zealand very unlucky

I still feel disgusted watching this. Should have been another super over till one team won fairly. England was not the only team to win that day. They don‚Äôt deserve to win like this. I hope NZ gets their redemption this year in India.

&quot;Neeshams Six is just insane&quot;

Best thriller match in the history of world cup

Stokes thrives on adversity.

Why not new highlights

It was so good

Fir ye bolte hai cheating krta hai

Who played an important role for England to win 2019 worldcup?Ans : Dharmasena 

4 years later, as a Kiwi, it still hurts. But despite the controversy, we had the privilege to witness 22 players across 2 teams throwing absolutely everything they had at each other, and as fans, that‚Äôs all we could ask for. Truly the most enthralling, dramatic and thoroughly awesome game of cricket ever played.

Newzilend ke Throw se jo 4 run mil gaya thaa England ko yahi karan newzilend ke harne ka

Cheater Strokes......

won off of a draw....

<a href="">

Liam Plunkett is the most underrated in this match

over through runs lost the match

4 years has gone by fast.

BEST MATCH EVER!

No one  match better than this

English cowards cheat this match overthrow 4 the reason for the lost of newzealand

Robbed by england

By the bearest of marginsWhat a choice of words from Will Smith- The commentrator.His commenatary has made this much special &amp; still gives goosebumps.

Galat tha a Newzealand ka world cup

Williamson after win :Williamson after lose Who will agree this

Those plenty of 5 runs  whyyy?

Iss year aus.jeetegi
So Stokes, ECB and the pompous Lord&#39;s, where was the &#39;spirit of cricket&#39; when Stokes did that &#39;thing&#39; for extra four runs? Biggest hypocrites in World Cricket? I think so

This has to be one of the best finals compare to all Australia winnings finals

England will win the World Cup 2023 and will defeat India in India in test series

Game was not won by either side. Only the person who made that rule handed the worldcup to English team

The real stars of this game were the commentators ... Those dudes were outstanding

New Zealanders are the legends

agony for newzealand

Revenge will be the first match of 2023 a eng vs nz 2023 230pm Bangladesh time October 5
Pakistan defeated both these finalists in stage matches 

England won the finalNewzeland won the hearts Ô∏è

England V New Zealand 2019 LordsArgentina V France LusailCSK V GT AhmedabadThe best games ever played in the history

You know match was legendary beacuse even after 4 years...My heart is racing watching highlights!!

Life long goosebumps match

Amazing attack of woakes, archer, wood, rashid and plunkett. What a bowling lineup that is.

Ben stokes obstructing the field and not given out, looks like queen gave the decision

I will tell my kids that 2019 world cup was win by both Nz And Eng

Till today I have never seen such a final in cricket.
Super over again
To this day, people underestimate how special this was. Simply one of the most dramatic sporting contests in history. The events throughout were beyond ridiculous at times. Will never happen again so feel blessed if you watched it live.

just imagine if the ball didn&#39;t hit stoke&#39;s bat on the last over... New Zealand would&#39;ve had their first cwc win

best one day cricket match of all time in a world cup final super over you will never see that again

That last words .....England have won the wc with bearest of margin

Had to feel for Kane Williamson. Did everything right for his team to make it to the finals. Very unfortunate lose in the finals.

l
I saw 2023 cricket world cup 

Weird thing is the hero of England Stokes is originally from newzealand

bowl out method should have been done

Is match me Riyal wineer nrwziland hai

An abnormal match I had priveliged to watch live.....

England 
Worst world cup final ever

Newzealand was the real winner 

Cricket won
Odi cricket at its peak

What a greatest match of cricket history

Accept the fact England never deserved this world cup and i saw more thriller on 23 October 2022 üáÆüá≥üá≥üáø

Biggest scam in the history of cricket

The bat deflection runs were not to be counted according to the laws of cricket. The umire made a mistake

I would like to see White America

<a href="">

This Time World Cup In India

Where did Boult go?
<a href="">7:02</a>

Icc= indian cricket council... How india destroy yhis sport

Overthrows flying from the bat of stokes was the World Cup for England. Remember kiwis won all hearts

This was the best WC finals ever!! The cricket gods just pulling the strings throughout the match. Stokes six, that unfortunate over throw. Man, this final was crazy!!

14 july 2023 .. exactly 4 years ago

The pure technique - HENRY NICHOLLS

This is the best odi match in cricket history.

Itni takleef 2003 mein nhi huee jitni iss final mein huee thi... Ekdum gully cricket wala rule k hisab se England ko WC bheek mein mil gaya tha

Who is here after 4 years of this match ‚ÄçÔ∏è

Four Years To This!!!! (2023)

In modern cricket 242 runs and tie.... Its mean quality cricket by bat and bowl... ODI cricket is totally cricket and test cricket as well. Love 

Nz can&#39;t defeat this stage he was not a four 

Newzeeland big mistake in last over

Cricket Commentary peaked here ! Ian Smith Ô∏è

Can‚Äôt believe this was 4 years ago today!

NZ deserve not Eng 
Sab fix tha bc icc bhiki padi hai abki baar india bcz india is venue

Exactly 4 years ago  the biggest robbery in the history of mankind took place today..England winning the world cup in such funny way was no less than a robbery.

4 years I hope this world cup its either India or new Zealand

Unlucky absolutely newzeland is unlucky 

Any legend watching in 2023 ?

It&#39;s been 4 years just now

If the Super was 15-15  why did England win?

What a game,What a FinalIncredible

I couldn&#39;t watch this live kmtt

<a href="">4:47</a> line was awesome

I&#39;m from India, I&#39;m supporting England for Football and cricket past 15years from my younger age, don&#39;t know y

Cheaters

4 years.....Still Goosebumps What a match!!!!
England badhmashi se 420 team world cup jittha england chitters thoo badakav team benstroke bada 420 badakav

I have watched this match live, but English team won this match by cheating.

We never have this luck in football

Underrated butler

The commentary in the final moments is magical.

They won because of staokes

I watched this pirated while my son was in rehab following leg surgery. I was stressed like hell and my wife told me to go to the gym while we waited for PT to be over. At the gym I could not work out and followed. I went crazy in this snob YMCA in Delaware. I went nuts when they won and no one knew why. This was amazing. And She&#39;s British. I&#39;m just worked there for years. American but fell in love with cricket over the years. It was a good day.

They have rainbows on the stumps now

The Match full of Emotions and Goosebumps.

4 years gone ..But still gives goosebumps

If anyone ever says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand sport‚Äù this video is one I always bring up.BY THE BAREST OF MARGINSSS

What a joke, it was. Newzealand is equally champion. An overthrow made England to tie. Luck

Guys, yes NZ were devastated and didn&#39;t deserve to lose, but they got over it in a handful of days. I haven&#39;t spoken to a single Kiwi who still calls it a robbery. It&#39;s mostly Indians and the odd Australian who still go on about it

<a href="">5:35</a> remember it was only guptill‚Äôs throw which knocked India out in the previous match

Williamson not win the world cup but win millions of heart 

This is the best final match of the cricket world cup history I belive , there won&#39;t be another masterpiece like this match delivered in the modern cricket world, hats of to both the teams who played till the last gasp

One of the most legendary final match giving goosebumps now also Ô∏è

Classic. It was on the same time with the Wimbledon final

kiwis are real winners . love from india

ben stokes  cheater sala
and they say they dont want to win like this

this is just not a highlight..its a lifetime memory of english hypocrisy

If you take usual tie breaker rules in cricket.ENG were above NZ by,1. Net run rate2. Number of wins in group stage or overall3. Previous encounter between the two teams which was won by England.Even NZ reached Semis just because of net run rate higher than PAK. Even though points were same.But since the rule was saying Eng won on boundary count, every idiot who had never held a bat are trolling them and saying that NZ were deserving winners.ENG were better and stronger team than NZ in the tournament.

Williamson

Stokes win against his birthplace

I thinking one of the greatest best odi world cup final match ever in the history of cricket game no dowt  but I am happy after India üáÆüá≥Ô∏è my second favourite team is England deserve this teamÔ∏è

This proves England is the best Cricket team that has ever played.

Here after Ben Stokes said he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt want to win a game like that‚Äù in the 2nd ashes test‚Ä¶. 

I still cannot believe England were declared the winners. New Zealand definitely won this with less wickets lost.

King of wc finals. What a spectacular match it was

All fix...Ball bilkull fulltoss thi ...aaram se boundry thi ...but stokes ne player ke haath mei ball daal di ...all scripted

There was big fortune in the side of england.

That extra four run shouldn‚Äôt count based on the spirit of cricket. Return the World Cup to NewZealand !!

All time greatest match 
England robbed New Zealand here and now they&#39;re crying over a stumping 

England&#39;s pace attack  Woakes,Archer,Plunket,Wood
Nearly 4 years on. What a game! Channel 4 showing it meant I could watch this classic match. It made up for the disappointment of the 1992 Final.

<a href="">5:33</a> who else watching after the ASHES 2023 BEN Stokes statement

The wrong decision costs New Zealand

Epic match

Ben Stokes forgot about the spirit of the game here  because it suited them.

Till date the biggest robbery in Cricket...

Williamson 
It is said that England is a traitor team as much as betrayal.
That&#39;s Fact which team win Semi Final 2 thats team winner of Trophy

Like  the way ben stokes raised hands up apology. Looked like mission accomplished.

3 years and still get goosebumps

Poor people keep crying.if there was not overthrow stokes went for big one and smash boult out of ground.last ball was full toss.stokes went for double because England not need for maximum that time.

Spirit of the game now English fools?

Thief Ben stokes make the leg bi 4 intentionally...

A kiwi wearing English colours and playing against his countrymen.. no honour!

Cricket world cup 2019&#39;s final and fifa world cup 2022&#39;s final both were thrilling 

Newzeland are the real winners

this has to be the match of a lifetime

Namostu gurudev
Williamson should have come in and faced the super over along with Neesham. Guptill was not in good form in that World Cup

Last two runs needed in 1 ball guptill ran 1 run it should be tie anyone exolain

Worst decision of that overthrow

This match tells us the real meaning of final

The most disgraceful and underserved world cup champions in the history of sports. They became champions because they had hit more boundaries.Unacceptable

Poor new zealand
The most legendary match I was full live match with super over

According to icc rules,If we will run out while going for 2ndThen 1 run will be countedNz in the last  ball lost their wicket while going for 2ndThen 1 run counts??

Big match player Ben stokes
This was NZ &#39;s world cup ...

England cheating1.the ball was intentionally deflected from the bat by stokes during overthrow and went to boundary. Those runs should be cancelled2. Both the teams are level even after the super over so it is a tie

I hate cricket but this was mental, so much im back here rewatching it 4 years later 

it&#39;s like a movie, no one will believe this happened in 200,300 years if this is not recorded

Karma for dhoni run out to new Zealand

Newzealand winner 2019 world cup

It is best world cup final
