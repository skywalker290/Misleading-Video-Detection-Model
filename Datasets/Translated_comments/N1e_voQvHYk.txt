About ready to upgrade from this one. Definitely starting to show its age to me.

<a href="">10:46</a> Hearing this in 2024 is crazyMaybe they got so much of his ideas 

Thank you for the video. I bought the 12.9 Wi-Fi 256 GB. But question, when was it that the IPad Pro was to replace a laptop? In 2010 Steve Jobs made it clear that the iPad was to be used in between the iPhone and MacBook.

Its crazy how he anticipated the apple M Series and Ipados in 1 video wirhout knowing

What is the price

Loved the prediction for the m1 MacBook air chip 2 years in advance

..mouse doesn’t work because you use fingers

I Absolutely love this iPad pro, I recently got a killer deal on one ($300) because it had a small amount of damage to the right side where the apple pencil goes, it&#39;s hardly noticeable when using the iPad, and it&#39;s not cracked , I&#39;m a college student going for film and animation so to be able to get one used for so cheap is a God send, and honestly I could care less about the m1 and m2 iPad pros, would I like to have one? OFCOURSE, but it doesn&#39;t really make all that much a difference for what I do in the day to day, it&#39;s 4 years old right now, so maybe in a few year, like 6 or so, I&#39;ll buy whatever iPad pro is out then, but for what I do, it&#39;s more than enough!

the magnet xray is definitely creepy

You can update to iOS 16 on that I think

Thanks for the review I was going to switch to this ipad from my old iPhone  because all the more recent ipad pros are basically the same so this one is worth it

Wow its already Jam 2023 and this 2018 iPad pro still rocks! Love the type of power you get with these tablets

It&#39;s fascinating to watch this in the beginning of 2023 and see what&#39;s changed since then, what hasn&#39;t, and what Marques correctly predicted.

It’s funny coming back to this now, iOS 12 definitely held back a lot for what the 2018 iPad Pro could do, but now with more updates like iPadOS out it’s almost everything you could ask for.  I’m still rocking the 2018 iPad Pro 11in and it is still amazing, don’t really have a need to upgrade right now

Outstanding information about the  ipad pro 12.9 for beginners to use.

Watching this review now as I consider what iPad I want to spend money on, now that the iPad lineup is so jacked. You kinda predicted the future of the M1 chips in this video! Nice!

BroApple got the iPhone 12-14 series inspiration from this ️

Oh! So iPad 
Existence

I have question for you, I got a message from you that I won a gift, but how do I get that from you? Or is that a scam that came to me from you?

Wonder why they got rid of the headphone jack?

&quot;This all has me thinking about two things. 1. Maybe iOS 13 when that comes out will really turn the iPad into its true form, and 2. when is Apple gonna start putting their incredibly powerful chips in Macs?&quot;could NOT be more spot on, and now im convinced marques has a time machine

<a href="">10:47</a> I forgot about this call Someone had some insider info.Will pay close attention next time.

Bro predicted ipad os and Apple silicon in the span of 30 seconds.

He called the m1 chip two yrs early lol

The Ipad replaced my laptop 10 years ago, Yes it’s an iPad……..what else did you wanted to be? ‍️

God is with you all godbless and your families and everyone in the world amen 

2.58....Your wish is granted

Purchased this today for $599 used in mint condition cellular version, will still compete with the most recent released iPad.

<a href="">10:46</a> It came true and it’s wonderful

What kind of iPad Pro is that one?

It’s amazing 
It’s en incredible iPad Pro
I bought one of these just now in 2022. Super glad to see his only problem with this was iOS 12. 2018 MKBHD would be so happy to see iPadOS 15

<a href="">2:55</a> wow! You have predicted that iPhone will look like that, even though it’s 2years after this video still amazing.

<a href="">10:48</a> Apple  has listened to your advice in 2021 it took 3 yrs to execute your idea ...

They ruined the aesthetics and app spacing with iOS 15.

This video turns 3 years old tommorrow, happy birthday ipad!

You called it in this video from two years ago

I’m fine it’s an iPad I don’t want to use it for a computer really for me it services a different function

Me just watching videos that youtube recommended me to watch:Marques 2018: “When is Apple gonna start putting their incredibly powerful chips in macs??”Apple: “Introducing M1 Pro and M1 Max”

Legends are watching this video with the same iPad

he predicted m1 wtf

this video is about three years old and i just bought the ipad pro 2018 12.9 inch verison

2 years ago me had the chance to buy this but I didn’t and on purposely bought a worse one

At least, it&#39;s an iPad...

I love how I’m watching this on an iPad Pro

he predicted the  m1 future

The purring great-grandmother neurologically pick because shoulder conspicuously stay across a zany passive. joyous, brave ceiling

<a href="">2:58</a> MKBHD called the boxy iPhone (ofc the 12th gen)

<a href="">3:00</a>  he predicted the IPhone 12

wow how times have changed

The nifty helium possibly hang because potato distinctly observe by a erect check. godly, absurd christmas

The iPad Pro is the gold standard in tablets. Even the ones that come close are 100% ripoffs.

The future is here  awesome

Can the old pencil work with the ipad pro?

Is it still good idea to buy 2018 model in 2021 ? I’ve never had one so plz need some advices ️

Love you Marques

Can’t wait for iPad update 15

okay ... until &quot;ios12&quot; i thought i was in the right year ._. love you youtube :D

Ipad PRO TOUCH  SUCKSSSSS ASSS

The lean hospital perioperaively yawn because temple seemingly suppose through a quack laura. squealing, sparkling pastor

YouTube how to use iPad pro

Is it possible to find this iPad on Amazon?Link ? Please

<a href="">2:57</a> Marques literally predicted iphone 12!!!!!

it&#39;s crazy that you predicted m1 Macs and iPad os in this vid

MKBHD making a DBZ reference.

At <a href="">10:45</a> Marques basically predicted the new M1 processor

Me watching this with my ipad air 4th gen that exactly looks like ipad pro 2018

The spiky spark proximately clean because lunchroom unquestionably enter atop a jumbled sardine. old-fashioned, bright random

Yo Marques you say Your Mkbhd but your channel name is Marques Brownlee

Are you sure about that?

Is this still good in 2021?

No shit it’s just an ipad.

The dead credit mainly compete because disadvantage particularly cure before a knowledgeable rise. sordid, rigid cupboard

THE MAGNETS TRIGGERED MY TRYIPHOBIA

You predicted literally everything or did they just made your words Into reality Well never know

Gl

How do I get that magnet paper?

The cloistered father thermodynamically press because tank pathohistologically inject mid a whispering board. meek, absorbing innocent

I like how he  pretty much predicted the future of apple

when u find a pro on kijiji for $350 instead of a iPad 5 for $300

what&#39;s  model name??
You look completely awesome on my new iPad Pro!

It’s not faster than a lot of laptops.  Those benchmarks are run on apples OS.  Put windows in it and see if it’s faster than most laptops lol.

<a href="">2:57</a>iPhone 12.

okay so how does it stand up how did Apple make it to stand up like that?

<a href="">0:06</a> - cleanest intro ever
<a href="">6:50</a>

And 2 when its apple gonna put their incredible chips on laptops, well thats a nice spoiler there

Isn’t this iPad Air?

Here to decide whether I should get the new iPad Air 4 or this 2 year old device that has more while costing the same (besides the older Apple chip but let’s be honest, you can’t really tell a difference from the experience anymore).

This guy just predicted the I phone 12

“When is Apple going to start putting their incredibly powerful chips in Macs. Maybe that’s coming in the future sometime soon.” Marques must have some type of time traveling machine.

<a href="">1:40</a> Now that&#39;s the richest way to hold an iPad.

2years ago he predicted that iPhone will come  with boxxy frame 

nah im getting a ipad ai
<a href="">10:45</a> Foreshadowing 2020 

Best intro i have ever seen..

Auto generated captions,,,”hey guys I’m POPPY HD here”Lmaoooo

Lol he called out 2 things and those happened1 boxy iphone2 Mac&#39;s with Apple chips

dud called the boxy iPhone 12 2 years ago

You are my favorite youtuber ever

The iPhone be said he would would literally described the new iPhone

man feels great on 4k

<a href="">10:45</a> Now :D

I can understand why they call it a laptop replacement because of what you can do with it now that we have iPad OS it’s replaced my laptop as I don’t do anything on my laptop that my iPad can’t do

so subtle with  the arrow telling u that its blocked pls move

He doesn&#39;t complain abt it not being a computer ....rather focuses on it being a tablet and describing those features instead of a Half video Rant about it not replacing ur computer ...just a joke at the start Perfect

marques predicted the future he said that one day apple might replace intel with their chips in macbooks

128gb how much storage available space on iPad pro-2020

Only thing that is affordable for me in this video is the freaking magnet paper.

When I think of a PC I think of Microsoft not anything else.

Insane intro tho

Just an FYI Your complaint at <a href="">7:46</a> is completely nonexistent if you get the bigger 12.9” iPad. The 12.9 inch defaults to the desktop version of every website and you don’t even have to toggle it on or off. It does it on its own.Edit; Also, I know you can go into settings on any iOS device and manually check the toggle that will force the desktop website every single time, But I was mentioning that the bigger iPad will do this automatically simply because iOS recognizes it you’re on a laptop size screen. Oh yeah and I think On the smaller iPads and iPhones, you can just long press the refresh button on mobile Safari and it will give you a drop-down menu that will allow you to force whatever website you’re on to use desktop mode.

Who&#39;s here after the apple event?

Sweet! Sold! I’m getting me one of these to upgrade my Air 1 

2099:iPad pro 99+ 20k qualityBattery life 1 month On screen fingerprint Super thin 800hz 13.9 inch

And still Expensive

damn marquess giving the name drop of the K <a href="">4:06</a>

I own it

I love the hoodie you are wearing

<a href="">10:45</a> Apple Silicon!

Wait did mkbhd predict the future?

<a href="">10:30</a> you predicted almost everything correctly

I really like marquess . His reviews are epic and genuine . Even I was thinking to replace my iPad as my only laptop . After watching this review I have second thoughts should I or should I not . Since I discovered him I &#39;m binge watching Fernando silva and Marques Brownlee. I really like their YouTube channels Kudos to both of them

I still love my 7 gen iPad
Actually wished í can aford an ipad

My brother found a coin that will be worth 30k dollars by 2021 so we’re both gonna get one I hope it’s not like my last 400 dollar outdated iPad that had the ghost touch glitch

This ipad pro 2018 is the best

Wait what is your middle name

Sir , i  want use a free photo editor please suggest me , in my ipad 7th generation

Its still an ipadApple:let me introduce to you ios 14Hold up its an lcd??? Damn apple with it again

Bro mehn I’m a medical student! Please let me have you iPad Pro! Would help me a bunch for taking my notes. Would be hella greatful

Imagine watching this in mid 2020 after Dub dub lol everything he’s said here is happening now. Including the chips coming to Macs !! 

My middle name is k

Your statement @<a href="">10:30</a> was solved in 2019Your statement @<a href="">10:47</a> was solved in 2020

If you&#39;re superior to buying the new IPad Pro, take a look at my long-term review! I hope it helps!

Dude watching this now... everything he hoped for actually came true one year later... thank you apple

Did IOS14 enable usb c of the ipad ?

using the 2018 and 2020, they r cool, but hard to replace pcs

<a href="">4:03</a> that’s just cruel

<a href="">4:05</a>  AWWW THAT&#39;S HOT. THAT HOT...

As a student... do you really need cellular?

which one could told me the title BGM

<a href="">5:13</a> looks very similar to the cutouts of iphone 12 pro prototypes

it came true in wwdc 2020!

1.5 years later ... both of MKBHD&#39;s questions have been answered ... really excited about the Macs on ARM tho!

pretty cool that both of his two speculations came out within two years tho

You only now realize how much has changed and improved since this video was made. It has been really hot recently and I’ve been replacing my desktop Windows PC for everything except gaming with my ipad pro (2020 edition) to avoid heating up my apartment even more. I’ve been importing RAW photos directly to Lightroom and editing them and making posts online and the only thing I really miss is having a full sized keyboard. I guess using the touch keyboard will get easier as I use it more. Really impressed with the browser too, it is literally instant that a page loads and it is the desktop version. This cost me more than my Windows laptop and I rarely use it because it has a really bad display, not at all good for editing photos. And the battery life sucks on it.

when will apple put these chips in the mac, bruh you are a time trvaller

<a href="">10:46</a> Looks like that&#39;ll be coming up real soon

Is your middle name vendetta ?
<a href="">3:47</a> Apple with an LCD display Samsung Tab S6 with sAMOLED display : <b>Bruh</b>

*magnetic field

Who are coming after looking ipados 14

what was his middle name WHAT WAS HIS MIDDLE NAME?

Great review.  Didn’t mention the keyboard which is always shown in Apple PR.  Good to know that you can sill use the folder instead, which is my preference.

Upvoted for the trippy magnet xray vision thingy

Isn’t that what originally the iPad is supposed to be? In between a laptop and a phone? So the iPad wasn’t always supposed to replace a laptop, but it would be nice if it could replace a laptop

Serious questions: Can I make calls with sim card in? Do GOOGLE apps like DUO work, I need it mainly for video calling.Also what about USB connection???

<a href="">1:22</a> when u can’t afford an Apple Pencil

Does it make sense to buy a refurbished iPad Pro 11 2018 256 WiFI now for 679 USD or it&#39;s better to wait until Apple releases the new iPad Air with the same internals as the Pro 2018 and presumably smaller price?

Marques- &quot;It&#39;s more expensive than my laptop-sure it can replace my laptop&quot;Me- Thump on  face‍️
Yes they are the best iPad yet but they are stupidly expensive

Bro where did you get that sweater from

You were right about the new boxy iPhone

I like the part where he was describing my laptop specs

can you gift me this product

I wanted the iPad Pro I saw the price on this app called YouTube I know that you know what it’s called but I can’t get it because of quarantine

I’m watching this on an iPad 6

can you gift me ipad 6 generation for pubg streaming &lt;3

Could you compare the Ipad Pro to the Surface Pro X? I can&#39;t decide which to get...

How many inches is it

Is this better than the latest one? Thank you :)

summed up in the start

Imagine watching porn  jk

Can someone link me to the video where he talks about &quot;the numbers don&#39;t matter as much on apple specs&quot;? I&#39;d love to see this as an Android user.

nobody=me= <del>when hears an apple but my fav fruit is apple</del> me says: &quot;an apple?&quot;

Nice work

I’m getting this for school and it’s coming in a week I’m so excited  it will hopefully make quarantine better

I&#39;m gonna buy the 12.9 space gray woth the apple pencil, I&#39;m saving money,

Re-watching this video with knowing that Apple just launched ipadOS is so satisfying. Looks like I’m from the future 

Just wait till iOS 13.4...

if you need a keyboard then just get a laptop

Now it&#39;s a computer.

Came back after the 2020 ipad pro review and damn that is the dopest video intro ive ever seen on a tech video

Who’s stoked and getting the new IPad Pro 2020

Man, The Ipad Intro with Music. Insaning Beautiful, Great Job man! Hands down 

Don&#39;t forget the protruding camera which is a pain to hold and place on a flat surface.

It&#39;s a useless tablet. It can&#39;t even do basic file management. It&#39;s nothing but a toy for beginners

YOUTUBE Yeah the new iPad Pro has released we don’t want apple to make any more money so let’s recommend the old one

His middle name is Kevin

I think Apple should make Two versions of iOS for there Devices! One version would be used for iPhones, and the second one should be a PC iteration, something like windows thus making it perfect for the iPad bro!!

Did you know that the iPad Pro is a Latop?

How nonsense it is to say &quot;the best ipad ever&quot; for the latest ipad...

A dope critic, which means they need to listen for better out put in the future. Im also feeling the new iPad Pro.

I’m kinda wanting to save up for AirPods, not the hair dryer ones, an Apple Pencil and an iPad Pro. The thing is I don’t have $1,300 :(Edit: plus the keyboard case

Check out my app ShadowDraw. It is too fun on the iPad :) If you see this then send me a message in the app and I will give you 1 week free.

Great Video!

Im looking this from the latest ipad pro, i just realized how lucky i am of having this when are people that die of starvation, now i feel guilty XD (im latina, my english is bad)

I went out to get this iPad today and I absolutely love it! I believe I won’t need a pc or Mac anymore with this one! Thanks for the review!

bro give me one ipa

More changes in iPad pro @ Look like the final form already arrived (iPadOS), it could replace the macbook’s file management, would you agree?

Why do I even watch these videos I have an s5 and own a used chromebook

Did your iPad bend ?
I watched Linus&#39;s add on mkbhd&#39;s video 

Hey Apple, how about an extra lock on the email, can’t lend anyone my iPad because they have access to my email once passcode is in.  Duh!  Come on man!

That magnetic paper bro tell me what that’s actually

Ipad pro 11 or 12.9

I would have prefered to have the silver 12.9 in but here i am grey 11 in. I guess u get what u get for ur bdayAlso it does have mouse support

anyone peep <a href="">4:06</a>?
I needed this for my company, and it seems as though it wasn&#39;t a bad choice. It&#39;s a tax write-off for sure but damn $1700!? I&#39;m a Samsung Samurai , so time will tell if I jump to the orchard. Thanks great review!

Photoshop,  this or Surface? And which config would u rec?

i hope it has black and gold color in the next gen and also a 15inch version

ok don’t believe the hype finally got my hands on one and will be sending it back...i was coming off the iPad air 2 and at times forgot i was even using a newer iPad the differences are just not that big nothing a normal person would even notice. Im mad i gave my old iPad to my daughter now forced to buy a new one if i would’ve waited until after testing it out i wouldn’t even be buying a new iPad i would’ve stuck with air my air 2. All the AxQz crap means nothing my iPad air 2 in my eyes was just as fast as this 11 inch the difference in size is barely noticeable, battery life last the same, charges up the same,  games play the same. The screen may be smoother but my iPad air 2 screen was still nice. you are paying for a pencil fr...because everything else is normal iPad usage. dont get tricked by all the fancy computer terminology because when it comes to using it you are using the same system i promise. The ipad air 2 operates just as good and you have a home button and headphone jack. grrrr i hate being tricked.

SUBITITLES PT-BR PLEASE!!!!

Is it worth the money ? The second hand value of an Ipad Gen 2 , 512Gb, 11.9&quot;  depreciates in value much faster than an macbook pro. I think people will be better off investing in a macbook pro. at the end of the day, they do cost a lot of money.

Can u do an iphone vs ipad video
Marques they added the pados

iPad Pro:️️️️️️️️️️
It&#39;s better now with all the new updates.

which app is best for taking notes in Ipad pro 12.9

I have the iPad Pro and I love it and now I want to get one for my 10 year old son but I don’t know how much storage I should get for him. Can someone help me?

What about Pixel density ?

Expecting an iPad to replace your laptop is like expecting a motorbike to replace all the benefits of a family car. It&#39;s stupid. They each have their own niche

Im just confused how much space and time( and lol- glory) u spent with 90 khz on OnePlus but barely nothing with this 120 khz,does that mean 120 khz isnt that great stuff with really big screens or not?

He didn’t talk shit about an Apple product!!!!!! This is a miracle

So nice
Would you recommend buying an iPad Pro with the pencil and keyboard for university? For taking lecture notes, writing essays, researching tasks, storing all my notes etc.. I already have a 2013 MacBook Pro but it gets annoying having to carry it around along with all my notepads and worksheets, it all gets kinda heavy and annoying. I thought just having one iPad with everything on it could be better?

Yeah. But actually, it bend easily.

Who is watching this in an ipad pro 12.9

great video so the conclusion is that if you like to add photos go for it or if you like to show of they should make it like mac book so all people will get it but that guy got it and said still ipad

which keyborad will suits on my ipad pro 11 inch .. please provide

watching this makes me feel poor but also rich at the same time

Uh......  one questionHow do you text messages to your friends with this super flat iPad

Now this doesn&#39;t really matter in the context of the video but apparently iOS was originally made for an iPad before they started work on iPhones

Yousef

Mine does not have the stripe near the charger? pls tell me why

Had to rewind for <a href="">5:24</a>, totally went over my head the first time. Tbh I also think they should&#39;ve went for it

Best ever? No aux,no home button,no mute button, its a big NO for me

and you still use the ath m50 , you need to switch to hifiman or audeze

I need one 

excuse me sir show me how to get this bag please!!

<a href="">2:50</a>

what does MKBHD mean??

anyone tried usb c to usb b cable for printing on ipad pro?

I wish I could afford one of these but I could only get the 7th gen and pencil. But I don’t use my iPad for work or anything near needing a pro. I did get the pencil and I love it.

THAT MAGNETIC PAPER FUCKING BLOW MY MIND!

its a bad ass tablet!!!!.. too bad the infrastructure lower then average...its too bendable...i think thats why samsung put the stylus charger on the back they afraid tab s6 will easily bend by not putting the same way apple did

Idk man a lot of people can do 90% of legit work on an iPad now days. Unless your trying to edit 4K video or do PRO video editing everything else can basically be done on an iPad Pro.

Want

Omg! This is beatiful

Still it&#39;s a dream to buy

I come from the future <a href="">3:00</a> the iPhone you speak of does not end up having the squared off and body style you wanted here’s to 2020

Can you use Final Cut Pro X on this iPad?

Apple: invents usb c in 2014Also Apple: only start using it on mobile in 2018

What&#39;s the storage in your iPad?

It’s a really nice iPad but too expensive for me for that price I could buy an iPad Pro 10.5 and an iPhone XS brand new and still have some money left over.

Ohhh one day iso 13 will come out and all this will make him sweet ////little did he know

Really good for the wedding with

Was that a bird in the video

From a musicians point of view, no headphone jack sucks ! Straight away that renders my irig useless and stops me from being able to hard wire it into my mixer. Apple have forced you to have to change your setup and go buy more ad ons such as Bluetooth headphones or an audio interface dock (not cheap!).

Kyle

After watching almost all the way through, I find out that the video was uploaded in 2018. Bruh!

But can it run Crysis ????And does it bend ???

Ipads are the only thing apple made that never received backlash. Like there  is no debate on what the best tablet is. The second best thing isn’t even known,we just know ipads are the best.

Best apple product yet

Who’s watching on the ipad pro, no need to like, just comment

apples changed man, apples changed. dont get me wrong, this is a great ipad, but go back to the release of this thing. ask your self, what would steve jobs do? how would steve jobs release this device? and you could probably imagine how much this thing would change. God Bless that Man&#39;s Soul, he was such an important revolution in this day and age.

I&#39;m an samsung guy but this ipad is amazing!!!!!

Doesn’t have a home button so I don’t like

It’s not the coolest iPad

I came reading comment

Samsung best phone.                                            Apple best iPad
I want that 

For ethical reasons I could never go to Apple, but I must say that their ipads are really satisfying to use.Also, what&#39;s this thing about trying to get tablets to replace your PC? I know not everyone is the same, but for me personally, tablet = for travelling, reading the news around the house, maybe giving presentations, doodling and notes. A PC is for proper work, on a desk; much bigger monitor, keyboard, mouse. Why try to go for a jack of all trades?

I have the new iPadOS... Guys, it&#39;s still a tablet. It&#39;s not a laptop replacement not even close

my dad watched this before me and asked me if i wanted the same i said yes

brilliant video. all in all

My sinking funds are not high enough for me to buy the 11&quot; and in 256GB

Ayyy is procreate on this?

@Kurama Rosetta I wanted to wait to get another ipad pro after I sold my 9.7 inch earlier this year. But I could not ignore all the greatness mentioned in this video. It is amazing how much one youtuber can influence Apple to make drastic changes to accommodate the needs of the professionals ! Truly they did watch this video and said...&quot;nope not today buddy...we are going to show you !&quot; I am a Best Buy member and gave me Black Friday prices early so I picked it up today for 649.99. This thing is crazy amazing !!!!!!!!!!

IS THIS 3RD OR THE 2ND GEN IPAD......LET ME KNOW THANKS

Im getting this for christmas

Can you tell me the performance between ipad 5th gen and ipad pro 2019..I was thinking to upgrade but have my own doubts

I’m working hard shoveling snow this winter for one wish me luck guys

I have iPad Pro

Love your reviews, just realized I&#39;m one year behind. Lol

please make an updated video after the iPadIOS release!! Does it now come closer to replacing a computer?

This with the ipados or an asus ux430??????? For a student

Honestly, you&#39;re like the... reigning mvp of youtube tech reviews. Nobody comes close...

Only American people and richest people  from others countries can buy it.That&#39;s sad. I&#39;d love to go to my university with Ipad and don&#39;t use a lot of papers. :(.

The intro made me instantly likeNice work

Why always noobs have great devices

One year old video it became exactly today 

I got an iPad Pro ad on this videoThe iPad was actually the old iPad Pro

13k moneys! I like saying money’s ok don’t judge I live in norway and I don’t know if all you understaaand

You are like the black version of @unboxtherapy 

Awsome

Thanks dude, I&#39;m going to wait for the newer model iPad Pro now as should be released soon, the 2018 model looks great though! Cheers...

Love it iPad 

I love that intro good job!

didnt like ios 12 then ipad os  came..

Not any longer!

every apple product is by nature incredible for him..no questions asked..

brown brown

I’m watching on it

How many of you guys can’t buy it but still seeing this video

The screen really is one of the best period.. but the device itself is great yet limited by it’s own operating system! Lol smh

school chromebook gang where you at

Little did MKBHD know about iPadOS!

I thought about buying this Ipad, the 12 inch version but 2 things that are deal breakers: 1. No audio port (I&#39;m not a fan of charging things so I seriously dislike bluetooth headphones) and 2. This is just a really really expensive Ipad. I need it to do more, replace my laptop.

If i ever want to get some kind of technology i come to this channel to see the negatives of the device. Lol this guy is pessimistic and finds the bad in everything lol

I have one but it gets so dirty when you touch it

Can we use Skype??
well thanks for the info im just bored ??

Thank you for this review Marques.  Do you have a favourite laptop?

me to like

Watching this in my samsung galaxy tab s6

Nice

You really need to have a series on Netflix ‍️

Watch Magic Paper on iPad<a href="">05:42</a> to <a href="">06:19</a> 

I still believe losing the headphone jack was not worth the reduction in thickness. Imagine how much more they could accomplish if they used this brutalist design with more thickness. Instead, they decided to handicap themselves by making it as thin as possible. And I’m mad because now all the other tablets are doing it, and it’s terrible for rigidity and functionality. Just take cues from the iPhone 11 series, added thickness with more afforded functionality like better battery life.

@mrx hindi gaming is using this ipad

Steve Jobs: Nobody wants a stylus!Apple: Guys we need to get a stylus, let’s call it Apple Pencil.

smooth review, thanks

Why does nobody talk about the teaser he gave to his middle name

who else was annoyed when he called THE ipad pro a tablet

so redo this review with the new ios that is out

hi can you make a video , teach us how to use pendrive add music to ipad pro&#39;s music library

<a href="">4:48</a> who payed for this LOL

Loved your review. Straight to the point and clear. Before I come here, I watched iJustine&#39;s review on iPad Pro and it was terribly draggy. She talks too much of irrelevant stuffs.

that paper is by far the coolest thing about this video

But what about the Tab S6...

Yeeeees im getting it next month!!
Intereesting how all those issues mostly are just software fixes. However, my biggest issues are the USB C connection issues. I can&#39;t sync it with with USB 2 iMac. It&#39;s super odd to me.

Growing up until I was 14 I had a 13&quot; tv in my room.....this is the same size

Its perfect for me because I’m a business owner I prefer that than laptop

are there any up coming new ipad pro or should i just grab it now?

Those iPads look small on your hands XD

Welcome to iPad os

thank u so much for reviwe

Revisit this with the release of iPadOS?

Ok we get the ipad is good but what is your middle name?

The youtube problem that you show in your video can be solve using safari with “request desktop version” easily.

iPad Pro? More like iPad 10
Hi Marques, thanks for a non apple user, making choices for my biz!! However.. what is the fluffy thing moving on the floor???

Kalvin is your middle name for sure! mark my words

i like it

<a href="">1:41</a> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

 “my middle name is K..”
All the new iPads are AMAZINGOnly problem I have with them is the durability, one drop and boom, gone

Can u buy my me one plz I really want one to up my FORTNITE game.    

Who else thought that the magnet paper was better than the ipad

I have the iPad Pro

wau good
iPad: nothing ehiPad: iPadOS can do everything he said he couldn’t do!

<a href="">1:47</a> You can do that now with iPhone 11 Pro :D

Can you give me one apple product for free , really wish to have on of apple device T-T ;(

Him: iPad can stand up on its thin sideMe: what happens when it <b>falls</b>Him: let’s balance the iPad on one finger!Me: what happens when it <b>falls</b> :(Him: <b>CRASSHHHH</b>me: what did I say -_-

Hey what app were you using for photo editing?

I still want to know what makes this product better than. Laptop??

An apple a year will make your money disappear

Can you make an iPad Pro revisited video?

What is that song in the intro?!

How much does this thing cost anyways???

Very disingenuous to state no or thin bezel when you have 10mm of unusable &quot;screen&quot; all the way around which cmon it&#39;s bezel.

debating on trading in my old MacBook for an iPad Pro. Any suggestions?

i think the biggest flex would be airpods, iPhone XS Max (11’s ugly) 2019 ipad pro and a brand new macbook pro

Too expensive. Decided on Huawei M Lite

Hey.. I need some advice.. should I buy iPad or macbook pro for office Sirk??

ipados is he game changer
I remember getting really mad at my friend who has an iPad mini 1 saying my new iPad Pro was slow when she didn’t know that the WiFi in my house sucks. I realize I may be part Apple warrior

<a href="">2:57</a> nope.

Its 2018 10 months ago and hes talking about the iphone of the future. i wonder what his future self is telling him about the new 11’s

I&#39;m hacking it so it be able to do more than this..

I’m still have the first iPad air 1GB RAM :-|

WHATS IOS 12, WHEN THE BETA FOR IPADOS IS HERE. IPADOS FOR THE WIN OVER THE LAPTOPS
It feels amazing being able to watch this on exactly the same model hard earned iPad.. I wish you all luck in achieving that which will make you happy

I cant afford it
Apple remove the headphone jack in the Ipad because they needed the space for battery

Is it good for YouTube video editing ?

Nice, beautiful,thin and breakes like a cookie...... pathetic

You are a great communicator.  Thanks

Thank you!!!  I did need it to replace the laptop, but I think I am still going to get it!

So what was your middle name

I have to

Outstanding presentation. I was on the edge on buying one but, I think I am. Thank you

I like Ipad pro good work

i use an alienware 17 laptop so trust me this cant replace my lappy

so what does that mean . . .&quot; Still an I Pad&quot; -   why doesn&#39;t this replace your Macbook Pro?

I am watching this vid on the iPad pro

Hey Marques Brownlee if you want to use it as your pc all you have to do is jailbreak it and then you&#39;ll be able to do everything you just mentioned. After a jailbreak the possibilities are endless. Also you can get a desktop app for your sites it&#39;s called Puffin Browser. You&#39;re welcome.. (Who uses safari?) :)

The new iphone 12 should look like this ipad with less bezels and minus the notch. Like if you agree..

Apple thinks they control everything. Bull Shit. Linux will take over the world in the future.

First two letters of his middle name are “Ka”

Perfectly balanced as all things should be

One day when I start getting YouTube revenue 

Why would I get an ipad pro over an air?

<a href="">5:30</a> They have the courage to say slofie  but not No.2 Apple Pencil?!

Great but I’m too broke for Apple!!!

Hi, can you please review the samsung galaxy tab s6?

I have it saved up birthday money from 3 different birthdays waiting for a cool iPad to come out so I could afford it

I hope I can own that one. 

Well, uhm. I don’t have a computer

<a href="">8:34</a> who else noticed something moving

Brah.....you need to tighten up your hair lol

Just purchase laptop is anyone thinks that  it laptop replacement, then you are not sure what is tech,

Hi! I just won an iPad Pro from my dentist! I&#39;m here to learn all about it! So, thanks for doing this review!

i watch these videos and then want an ipad pro but then i look at the price and i’m like “never mind”

Intro Song - Italo Disco. You are welcome.
Less than a minute and know I (may like it but) can&#39;t justify buying.

You make black people proud!!! keep doing what you do, young man

I think a tablet should have more RAM than a phone. 

Lol I’m watching this on a iPad pro

“No headphone jack”Yeah..yeah but why though? It’s a productive device.. a huge device.. what is the excuse now?

Your writing is so bad 

How much it take

You have a hydro flask sksksskskksskksksksk an i oop

I’m watching this on my iPad but it’s not a pro it’s not the mini I forgot but it’s kinda big

I just combined it with my my Mac and it’s <i>EPIC</i>

please do a tab s6 review

Oh apple...

Me , watching on ipad 4 . WOW

i watched reviews of people reviewing and making stupid jokes it&#39;s just annoying  thank u for staying professional, good review

This can replace a macbook for so many reasonsBut apple dont want to

The pro can be used with the Logitech keyboard as well.🇺🇸

Great review, thnx.

And the lack of headphone jack ruins the whole thing.

And i am watching this on my iPad 6th generation.

I wish I had this ipad inshallah I will have it

Hey Mkbhd rereview the iPad pro with the iPad Os

That ipad would be great, if it wasn&#39;t an ipad

<a href="">0:37</a>Apple: Rolls out IOS 13

snooze... wake me up when apple decides to give external monitor support. :P

Marques: &quot;You could plug in any mouse in the world and it would not work&quot;Meanwhile at Apple

<a href="">1:38</a> the biggest risk a human could take

Marques....I have been considering iPad Pro pro to replace my MacBook Pro and my iPad Air... I am a long-time Quicken user and a TurboTax user… I don’t want to store any docs on an iCloud because someday they will boosted... so, having said that can I download Quicken software to an iPad Pro? And can I download TurboTax to an iPad Pro? Or if I use their online versions can I print documents at the end of the year and save them and not store them on an iCloud?....An answer from you or someone else would really be appreciated...I really appreciate your reviews by the way....Maybe your statement “it is still an iPad” answers my question

Love the 12.9. It doesn&#39;t really feel big once you use it a lot. I&#39;m kind of scared to go down to the smaller one When I buy one for my own personal use but I feel like I will appreciate it being much more handheld. But then again if I&#39;m going to use this for Netflix and gaming, I might as well have the nice big screen. Even for taking notes, it&#39;s nice to have the big screen. But I&#39;ve got a 15-in laptop so I might as well go 11-in on this one. Maybe they&#39;ll compromise and go 12 inch this year.

Got one for work. I am definitely sold.

Markass Brownlee, good review

Samsung tab s4 left the group..

Does it bend?

I&#39;m gonna try to get this one! 

Even if it is an iPad it is the best tablet out there.Coming from an android user.On phones yeah Android is far superior.But on tablets iPads are much much better.

Please giveaway please bro bro please

Love this I pad just loved it

RIP headphone Jack...

Planning to get this. Looks very amazing.

<a href="">10:28</a> You were right. Apple delivered.
Wish we had similar paper to put on a woman&#39;s head to see here thoughts and feelings :)

Hey, can ipads be used for coding?

I missed the start of the magnet paper section, when I looked back I saw him rubbing some kind of crazy alien x-ray bendy TV on the iPad.

Powerful solid state insides? You mean Toshiba?

the editing on thisssss

This is my dream iPad. I want it so bad!But I&#39;m so poor because I only have the iPad 2nd generation

Awesome
Comments:60% Marques brownlees middle name is ‘(@/8/!39.9999998% iPados is better now0.00000002% describing the comments

<b>I like watching stuff i can’t afford</b>

That is way to big for my hands

<a href="">1:50</a>

God your are rich
I’m getting one tomorrow

If you want more computer features, just request desktop site. Don’t gotta get a whole computer, geez.

this big things should come with its original keyboard case with no extra charge. and I hate they have to make it thinner in every generation. it&#39;s not a must. They should stop it somewhere or next generation They will have to sell just a regular paper to people.

Who else watching on the new iPad Pro?

iPad - I’m unstoppable with my powerdistance from table to floor - I’m bout to end this iPads whole career

Damn.....your pullover is 

Yeah, IOS SUCKSThey should have just ported OS X to ipad

Hope apple realizes that a new design for the iPhone like the flat ipad pro will change the game again for them.  New renders of the upcoming iPhone seem to point to a boring direction though.  I feel every apple user who has moved to androids due to the boring designs apple has been launching every year will come back to apple iPhone if they make the design same as the new ipad pro.  Wireless charging is slow so losing that would be fine and not many people will mind it.

Are the specs the same for all storage models??

Man were you wrong.

Please make a comparison video of Samsung galaxy s6 tab &amp; ipad pro @ Marques Brownlee

I just don’t understand you why does time you don’t reveal it we know we been watching it like over age ago but just to go to boxing like the iPod touch read oh that stuff

your middle name is Karen?

Who else is watching on their iPad Pro?Not me lol

I always want that ipad this video is amazing

my middle name is k.......?
Hi Im a business student and Im trying to decide which Ipad I should buy... I was thinking on Ipad air 3 because its quite &quot;cheap&quot; but I think that I can afford  the 11 inch Ipad pro, however, I guess that I wont take full advantage of its max potential, can somebody help me?

BROOOOO IM GETTING THAT ON CHRISTMAS UGH IM SO EXCITED

Nice video, Marques, thanks for the presentation

just watch jerryrigeverythings video.

Make New Review with iPad OS 13

I want it

Best I pad review

It’s amazing how he predicted that the next OS will bring the iPad to its true form. Now, they support a desktop browsing experience, file support and USB Support. Begin frank, the file and USB support should have been built in a long time ago but I guess Apple didn’t do it because they didn’t want users downloading things outside of their App Store.I don’t think they will transfer their chips to Mac because they have to redesign the entire MacOS for that and it might not be worth it.

I only use my Tablet for reading books, magazines and youtube video&#39;s. I currently have a Samsung. I like the style of an Ipad. But the memory is not expandable with regards to storage space you are limited to your purchase. Plus, the price is quite expensive for what I would use one for. Maybe looking at an Ipad Air might be a better selection. What are your thoughts?

Watching this video on iPad Pro 12.9 WiFi+cellular 256GB

I have that,but is black keyboard

Correction: It does have mouse support. Works nicely with iPad Pro.

<a href="">1:40</a> <b>Now that&#39;s the richest way to hold an iPad.</b>

Mark ass brownie

Can I use the iPad pro to do all my study work for the needs of my university?

Love Apples directness and operating systems,,, best I&#39;ve ever used... but, as You say, It&#39;s still only an Ipad... and a very expensive one at that... my Droid is maybe 3% less perfect, but soooooo much more friendly and capable. Nice review. Wish I had this new tablet. It&#39;s a beautiful beast!

This iPad is amazing!!!! But I agree mate it’s still a iPad love the new pencil too.

Expensive but easy to break.

I bought this for college and man is it amazing

The endless of possibility&#39;s for apple has been always in question but greed and money and economic manipulation has always been the agenda for its purpose of existence! apple makes good potential extraordinaries products but there always a hardware updated to make people spend more money! software updates to unlock? Naaa Ha! we are giving it away mentality!

Still have two Ipad pro&#39;s. 2018. Impressive, not quit. They will not load the battery nomatter how I clean the ports. It is total crap.

The ipad  pro may be not nice at the back but hoo cares

i have 11&quot; better

Always here for the Markass brownly review

Apples greed will not allow them to give the consumers the choice of using a tablet with Macbook Pro ability.  They are so stupid not to understand that they will do a couple of billion by giving the Ipad Macbook pro tech.  The greed and blindness of this company has driven me away from them.  i&#39;m a galaxy man now.

should i upgrade from 10.5 ipad pro ?

All of your concerns with iOS has been fixed with iPadOS

Thanks

<b>him talking about the ipad</b>Me: oh thats pretty cool<b>him with the magnet paper</b>Me: <b>w</b> <b>h</b> <b>o</b> <b>a</b>

Can we get a link to the case you’re using in this vid plz?

$600 ipad pro 64gb  @
Is this the 11&quot; ?

I wish I Got the iPad Pro for my birthday and my birthday coming up on July 31st 

<a href="">6:42</a> &quot;I was twelve&quot;&quot;Me: ????

You need an hand stitched leather bag to keep it in

I’m 13 and my sisters 8 we both have iPad pros and she bent hers I didn’t lmao

IPadOS 13 just made this iPad the best tablet on the market, they improved the file management drastically! And that’s just one of the many fixes.

How about picking up a story that involves thousands of Apple I-Pad customers that involve &quot;Swelling Batteries&quot; due to Apple&#39;s over charge protection FAILURE.Apple&#39;s response, buy another one that one&#39;s no good and can&#39;t be fixed.Any attorneys looking for a class action lawsuit?

Just casually, &quot;My camera of choice is a Hasselblad X1D&quot;  said no one but Marques Brownlee.

Thanks, for your Advise. What would you suggest for casual internet surfacing   Google Pixel, iPad  Pro VS Mac Book Pro VS Mac Book Air. The only Apps that I use are Evernote, Google Docs and Sheets, Apple Reminders. I do no heavy Data Crunching . The only thing I do from time to time is edit some of my digital photos for my website and a coffee table book from time to time. WHAT is the leas cost option or best option for a long term investment. Thanks for your expert advise.

Fuck the ipad. Gimme some of the magnet paper :P

Hey am thinking of purchasing a laptop I am a teacher do you think it would be wise  to  thiluse this  instead of y

Ohhh boi I’m getting one of those for Christmas next year

iPadOS 13 should fix your problems

I’m getting that iPad if i get 2 B’s in school

I have the iPad Pro 12.9 for months now and I didn’t realize until you mentioned that it doesn’t ave a headphone jack...

I’m getting one in my birthday

I love watching this now, knowing they basically improved/fixed everything your said that was bad

I&#39;ve bought a new iPad Pro 12.9 256GB (Gen 2,. 2017) with LTE for $950  waiting for it to be delivered in 15 days :) Getting same Gen 3 would cost around $1500 here, and there isn&#39;t something really that Gen 2 can&#39;t run and that Gen 3 can, I doubt there will be, by the time there will be (which I doubt can happen for next 2-3 years as A10X is so powerful) we will already see iPad Pro 2020 probably.... so I can skip right to that 

I’m waiting for the iPad 26.5

What is the price in indian

Can u buy for me

Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Can i have it please?

the file organization is so bad on iOS, it puts me in such a bad mood whenever I try to work on anything.

Imagine if this ipad was a phone. It would be a modern day iPhone 5 with uniform bezels

Someone please tell me the intro song of the video ?

Watching it on 2017 ipad, anyone else...

Im so excited because im getting the ipad pro!

Mark ass brownie

what about the bends tho

My boi you can just hold the refresh button and it will say “request desktop site” and boom problem solved.

Wow, I totally agree with you! We really DON’T need the headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are soo cheap, it seems pointless to be using wires for headphones.

Wtf he&#39;s a fucking time traveller.

customer: Mah Ipad came bent.apple: it&#39;s a feature.

<a href="">2:06</a> What is that? Where did you find something to watch on this gigantic, incredible screen without any bazels? 

What app do you use to find the speed of your chip

Where did you get that hoodie?

Don&#39;t bend it

How much memory would you say I need?

I bought the 10.5 pro model. Its al lot stronger and have a 3.5 jack. The new ipad wil bend like a piece of paper.  The 10.5 is blazing fast do

<b>me imagining Minecraft game play on the IPad Pro v2</b>

Have the bend problem been solved, if so I want one.

APPLE DOESNT WANT IT TO REPLACE YOUR LAPTOP! OR COMPUTER! THATS WHY THEY HAVENT ADDED EVERYTHING LIKE A DESKTOP! ( Idk why I did caps :3 ) bUt yE

Can you do an update for 2019?

That moment when you are curious about the iPad Pro and refuse to buy one until you watch Marques&#39; video review.

is your middle name Kane?

Marques Kevin Durant Brownlee

Would you recommend this for video editing? For example my own YouTube channel. I’m a big Apple fan and use all IOS products already.

Basically iPad Pro needs to become a laptop, like Surface Pro. Then it would be perfect.

Is this waterproof?

AHHHA IKI KOI TODOROKI

But it is just a big display

It is basically a iPhone 10R

Except they bend way too easily 

Sick

Hey guys I&#39;m &quot;poppy he&quot;

I really like this!Edit: I got the 11 inch one !!

My middle name is kass

<a href="">4:05</a>. you son of a b...

I want one

i dont like apple phones but i really really love their tablets

Whether this ipad gets an update to ipad OS??

H

Funny to see this after iPad OS

I love my iPad Pro

I don’t think the iPad chip will go to the MacBooks anytime soon, since it runs on a diff architecture

The jump from 512GB to 1TB is a no brainer for that 2GB bump in RAM. My iPad Air 1 only has 1GB of RAM and has lasted since 2013 soooo yeah that’s nuts. Fair to assume apps are wanting to use more power though.

This is just the greatest iPad everWell damn it

I’m just waiting for a review on iPados

Wow, he predicted right

<a href="">10:50</a>

<a href="">10:50</a>

I like to call the I pad pro the iPad x because it has the same features as the iPhone X R

Doyouthinkeitis best to learned

How much Qatar riyal

Now im watching this review and mkbhd says ios 12 is its main issue..and apple kicked it out with ipadOS ..and finally mkbhd swapped ipad pro in exchange for his macbook pro

Marques Kasey Brownlee???
You predicted several things!

I just want to change the spacing of the grid.. wasted real estate

IPAD OS gets it done.

&quot;maybe iOS 13 will turn the iPad into it&#39;s truest form, it&#39;s final form&quot; nice prediction man .

Sooooo next is the iPad mini pro? (120Hz refresh, New design including usb c, wireless charging maybe?) Maybe an iPad pro 15&quot;?Foldables?It&#39;s a great time to be into tech 

Thank u for this video n that really helped me to figure out what to actually get for my son 

Can you please tell me your editing system and music system please. I am a very big fan of you please tell me. Please. I love this editing music and mainly video.

please donate me this ipad : )

I wish to had a ipad pro

Awesome

But now, This is not just iPad. If its with iPadOS

What&#39;s that sweatshirt?

Where&#39;s the 2019 ipad mini review?

Me watching this after iPadOS is announced:

Watching this on ipad pro 11 inch

Can you review this in light of WWDC?

Not just an IPad anymore

Looks like apple addressed all your issues with the new iPad OS Apple definitely took notice  Great to see you influence the tech world so muchCheers

looks like apple has heard you loud and clear this year .. .

Do a redux review when iPadOS releases

Hmmm... LCD-IPS how in my mi a2 lite!

As far as no headphone jack... I&#39;ve giggled at people on Public Transit because their cords are getting caught on seat rests as they board, and then their device goes flying or gets damaged... Aww, the joys of the Bluetooth headphones!I&#39;m going with the Brydge Keyboard which will come with a Back Cover, and it has better viewing angles over the Apple Keyboard Folio. I&#39;m still using the OG 12.9 and 2017 10.5 for some editing.The future is coming! 2018 iPad Pro will replace &quot;Some&quot; Laptops. Also, think of Apple being a Great Story Teller! This is Chapter One...

Now with iPadOS, its not an ordinary iPad anymore..

IOS 13 update? Would you now move as a laptop/desktop replacement?

<a href="">7:35</a> tot <a href="">9:05</a> MKBHD: <b>names a lot of iOS letdowns</b>Apple at WWDC 2019: &quot;Hold my beer&quot;

I am close to buying this. Do you see Apple updating the pro line up this year with the iPhones or will it be not till next year?

My middle name is K aren

SOOOOOOO IOS13 IS COMING OUT... HYPE

its almost like apple listened to you

Imagine putting the Ipad Pro&#39;s Chipset on Phones.

You can talk . Ahhh. Talkative. Chattering away

Make ipad open ios.. end of samsung

<a href="">10:30</a> Looks like the final form already arrived (iPadOS), it could replace the macbook’s file management, would you agree?

Who’s watching this on the anti broke boy device...AKA: the iPad Pro

You should revisit some of this after you try it with iOS 13. I think some of software changes might resolve some of your cons from this video?

Your dreams have been answered as of wwdc19

I literally said a few days ago, “The next time I update my iPad is when they put Face ID on it.” DAMN IT APPLE. I know this is actually a pretty old product and I’m wondering where I was at when it was released. It’s honestly making me drool, and I can just imagine having this with the new Apple Pencil and it’s just.... I want them soooooo bad now, but I just got the iPhone XR in March, and I am currently to broke to spend 800+ dollars.EDIT: Also, your going to LOVE iOS13. Apple is adding all of the things you said your missing on the iPad, and just upgrading it in general.

Awesome, this review is what I exact think of iPad Pro

You should update this video with iOS 13.

iPadOS!!

Can you connect a apple watch to this iPad I dont want to buy a iphone

Is it better to get the smaller or the larger version?

I’m getting that for me birthday

What&#39;s the price of the new ipad pro???????

Thank you young man.  Very informative.

I just wanna play PUBG mobile

I think iPads are more for careers on the move like photography, art, videography more so those lines. In the business level I need this to be at... it won’t do, run, or be equipped for nearly the things I’m using my laptop for :/ that for me is where I can’t ...

do you think the Mac Pro will come out this year?

Who watching in IPAD Me I am watching in my IPAD 4th generationLike if your watching in iPad 

iPad has always been like the vision of the future of mobile computers. It’s the best way to browse the internet, it’s got a very easy and safe way to install applications, it’s got the best screen, when you use it you don’t have to think much about it, you have access to your cloud files at all times, and the battery lasts a super long time (like 3 days of medium usage on my 6 year old iPad Air with LTE). If apple stopped trying to compare it to laptops then there would be less confusion.

Forget the iPad Im getting some magnet paper. Wow.

May I please have that magnet paper

I have the same and it is amazing

I really like this one(as a photographer who edits a lot of photos), but the price is beyond me. I&#39;ll probably buy the iPad Pro 10.5.

please

ill take your old one

can i have one? im trying to ask litterally everyone for one of these because i have a REALLY bad singing channel and i wanna be an iPad pro artist im pretty sure you won&#39;t see this but whatever woth a try

Wat was the price

They should make the apple logo slightly bigger and GLASS  for wireless charging

<a href="">1:49</a>MKBHD:I can hold the New Unaffordable Ipad pro with my index finger.Me: Needs three hands to hold this shit .....Just to be careful

ppl. a tablet is not a laptop and it should never be. those two devices are a different category with different needs. Stop trying to compare one with another. or even worse trying to make one be another. I want my tablet simple and easy to use without those extra features that a laptop has got. enoug with dragndrop, task bar, 3d touch and complex split view. they should bring iOS 9 back.

wait you want to use the browser version instead of the native app? you must be mental.

new feature: bendable one way.

Watching this on my iPad Pro and I’m loving it.

Why don&#39;t companies just make TVs with rounded corners like this or monitors that has rounded corners like this?

How do I connect an iPad Pro to a retina MacBook since the connector  is USB c to USB c

How Is The Videography And Is The Camera good Enough To Take The High Quality  Videos ?

Nice video! Really appreciate the honest reviews. My only concern is I’m an average consumer. Not a technical person. Please explain why an iPad should replace the computer? Not in technical geek terms.

To go to the YouTube desktop site, just scroll down to the end and there is option to go to the desktop site!

That iPad is cool - but THAT MAGNET PAPER THO

If they introduced MacOS for iPad Pro then it would be way better. Like DeX for Samsung.

All i can afford right now is watching these videos on 144p.

Were did you by that

I’m getting one of these for school soon with the Apple Pencil, and I can’t wait

It a pice  of crap

Most incredible and beautiful useless thing ever created by human

Someone give me something like that pls!?

The iPad Pro is over $1000 here in Australia!!!! I opted for the 9.7inch iPad 6th gen because I’m not going to spend over $1000 on a tablet. I’d consider it if it were priced at like max $650 then yeah but no.

Who would gift me an iPad Pro 

Is the USB-C port a Thunderbolt 3 port? would that make it future proof for IOS 13 and beyond?

Hardware is outstanding but software not so much.

Brand recognition

Is this that one with no structural integrity??? Hmmm

There’s no such thing as magnetic charge

Loved it buying it right now amazing product

Will this work as a MAC for a normal man

That’s a badass sweater 

Apple just doesn’t want the iPad to kill the Mac.

Is it both a laptop and an ipad?

can 12.9&quot; crank 1440P on youtube app?

“The best Foldable iPad” There you go

What happened to the exposure <a href="">10:55</a>

Marques ketchup brownie

His middle name is Kalvin. It&#39;s Kalvin.

Why won’t you try using the BRAVE Browser???

iPad is weak on memory. The order to sell you. More for .99 cent a month I think it’s the only bad think other than retrieving a forgotten password.

Bought the iPad Air 2 with cellular, didn’t use it.Buys a iPad Pro gen 3, thought I wouldn’t need it. I EFFKING NEED IT

<a href="">3:04</a> &quot;ehh&quot;

the reason it is an i pad is !   it is an i pad   doh !!!!!

Ur biased clearly. note that he is on apple side

I would love to play vainglory on that gigantic device 

<a href="">1:35</a>-<a href="">1:50</a>You guessed it<b>perfectly balanced, as all things should be</b>

the desktop feature on the safari tab of youtube is fixable, u press the share button, and you scroll until you find desktop mode

that. transition.

I need that but I have no money. Can you give it to me for free?

So basically the IPad Pro should have its own different os? Not for me I just want a tablet

How much do you get paid by Apple?

Apple is a tablet and phone company and nothing more.

Hello Marques <b><i>K</i></b> Brownlee.
I have that iPad

usefuk for art
intro music/?
You can draw like that on every budget Samsung smartphones lol this is so overrated

but what&#39;s his middle name?

<b>cries in poor</b>

There should be an app to switch between Mac OS and iOS.

I&#39;ve had 2 iPads (still rocking my original IPad Air) and as someone who consumes media fairly heavily, I&#39;ve never really felt a need to have a laptop. I know they will probably never replace laptops but an IPad is all I&#39;ve ever needed or wanted as a main device.

Apple should be happy it is the last time I buy iPad from them because their video slow motion is so sensitive it turn on by itself and I hate slow mo now. So stupid video app.

Where&#39;s the front cam?

I would discontinue the Macbook Air line. Remarket the iPad Pro (or close) to the MacBook Air, and leave the iPad line upgrading it when needed, just like how they offered to sell the iPod touch after the iPhone came out but didn&#39;t upgrade it all that much. I might be misinformed on some stuff, so let me know if this is something that isn&#39;t crazy haha.

<a href="">4:03</a> he was about to write his middle name.

Please give too me your old iPad

You have old iPad

I know I’m probably in the minority but I would not like to have this squared design back i dont need a stretched iphone 5

Would you guys buy an iPad Pro with windows or Stock Google android?

Great review!

<a href="">0:58</a> it&#39;s like Fry from Futurama when he tries to press the button to launch the garbage ball and he misses

Apple-We the best. Samsung-But can you make fire with that iPad.

Pleas give me an iPad pro pleas i want it pleas

Not worth the upgrade if you have the previous version. This is just for people who like to have the newest products that come out but certainly not worth the extra money unless you need that 120HZ display.

This Ipad looks so flat, I just wanna break it. 0-0

If you really wanna replace your computer with a tablet then you need the Samsung tab S5e..

The iPad pro almost costs the same as the iPhone xs max, why though?

<a href="">8:16</a>Did you notice that the smart connector is not aligned with the USB-C port?

a youtuber rumbling about a stunning device that is not what was supposed to do...

Apple need an iPad Software !!!! Like this comment to the Top 

<a href="">6:00</a> allien shit O.o
Thats no excuse to lose the headphone jack

if i controlled rewind i would wind fortnite and marques brownley

It’s incredible! So classy and productive device, also it’s so inviting to be artistic! There’s a lot of things you can do to it!I just love it in so many ways!

Omg I just got it 

Nice editing 
I just broke my ipad9.7 today because it slipped from its magnet cover ;-;

Gonna stick with my Samsung s5e

People play on this as a mobile device

<a href="">5:07</a> this goofy ass pencil position made me laugh harder than i should&#39;ve 

hey you are using the tech the Physic Girl thought you

Can you play Angry Birds on it?

The most expensive laptop yet is still a tablet

Magnet Paper,,, wowwww,, good demonstration.

my middle name is k .............. ?

what is the secret of your creativity? EPIC

Can you write papers on this thing? I might get one for the creative apps, note taking, programming (I’m sure there is an app for that), and writing even if it’s just Pages.

That’s pretty good reveiw Markass brownlee

Middle Name Keanu?

what is that green paper???

Can I edit video here with ease??

<b>Android tablets have left the chat</b>

You sound like you work for Apple

That intro music tho 

Thanks for putting the new iPad Pro into perspective! I own an iPad Pro first gen and have found that I, too, can still do everything the new one can do. Now, if iOS13 brings about some major changes I might have to reconsider! Thanks for the review, and nice camera btw!

You have by far the greatest quality of video on YouTube let alone for tech reviewing channels

Can you please review the 2018 iPad 9.7 inch

Who is watching this review again after buying this iPad??

I always watch his videos cause I love the way he talks and his voice.....

SOMEONE HELP. I already bent my new 11 inch after only having it a little over TWO WEEKS

Love my new pro. It’s amazing. And replaces my lap top often. Unless I need to game it acts as my lap top. And often I play PUBG mobile and it works better than my PC

bendgate meme
My tablet dose replace a windows computer but it&#39;s not and iPad it&#39;s and Android

expensive but useless

&quot;Magnetic charge&quot;.Also, could have mentioned Diana from Physics girl here man.

Marques, please take a second look at the globe that sits on your desk to the right of you. It distracted me a little. It shakes on the table. That’s the only bad thing that I can observe. I love your perspective.

Anyone watching this with an iPad Pro, I am

Nyc filming spot
Its way too big

Is there an app that operates similar to VMWare?

Will next year or next generation iPad Air or Mini continue to use a lightening cable?

Excellent and very useful, thanks!

ATTENTION: HIS MIDDLE NAME IS KAYNE(iz a joke)
Can you give that too me pls 

you do have a  YT Studio ios app..
Can you also use this ipad as a wacom tablet of sorts with a desktop?

I wanted to know how to turn off my iPad Pro I have no idea how to shut it off

What is his middle name

If you press and hold the refresh button in Safari, you can request desktop version of websites.

Whats ur middle name

Watching from my iPad mini

How much is it?

One. Terabyte.ONE. GODDAMN. TERABYTE.

Damn that intro was smooth

.

My iPad Pro has a glitch it won’t read my touch 40% of the time

iPad Pro is incredible. So incredible I don’t give a damn about the audio jack,and that is saying a lot cause I hate that.

I&#39;m excited for iOS 13. I&#39;m currently using a Sony camera and bought the iPad pro as my main computer. And it&#39;s working.

Did u ‘request desktop site’?
There are much much better 3rd party folio cases than the Apple folio case and for a fraction of the cost.

Hey

Put Windows inside and I will buy it, design and display is great.

Who else is watching this on their iPad Pro?

You could use an app like Screens to access your computer, but that still wouldn’t fix the problem with ports

Best tablet is iPad good power efficiency and have higher performance in better way

I’d get the Silver iPad Pro 11 inch with Cellular 1TB

Has a unboxer and reviewer voice From a smaller youtuber

That&#39;s Hot!

finder on pro - A+ point

I don’t the facial recognition. I can open my Mom’s iPhone X because we look alike. ‍️ Bring back the fingerprint reader!

I won’t upgrade my iPad pro 2017 , because I don’t want my iPad bend like trash

I LOVE THIS GADGET TOO MUCHH
Even Jobs is still alive, he might not do better

Anyone elese watched this more than 5 times?

Magnetic paper was nice.

Please put a case on it after you buy one the iPad breaks so easily and it can bend so easily as well

<a href="">7:46</a> Not tryna be rude/salty, but you know there’s a YouTube Studio app in the App Store, right?

Did you take off the infrared lights in post??

<a href="">0:15</a>The fact that it can change the wallpaper so quickly, is crazy

What is your middle name ? K....?

Excellent review
Marques has a middle name?K.

I bet this ipad is great, but I can already tell you that the top of the ipad would be so hollow, if you ever got a crack there and accidentally applied pressure you&#39;re screwed. The entire pressure sensitivity  would be messed up and there wouldn&#39;t be a point :/

Ok someone need to line his hairline up 

UWU my baby lol (i have to tablet)

I watched this on the 12.9 inch one

Gift me an ipad nah bro please

anyone have scratches on the side corresponding exactly to where the apple pencil magnets attach?

Too broke to even watch this

“What’s your computer?”It’s an iPad Pro! Wait...

Apple will never make an IPad to replace a laptop. Because they won’t make money on their laptops.

139000 rs in India, way to much

would you recommend this over the surface 6?

marques khaira brownlee

SUMMARY: IPAD IS NOT A PRO ITS A TRASH

This is one of the best tech reviews I’ve ever seen

the intro was amazing.

Hey MKBHD, that intro music is sick! Can we get a link of it?

Hey MKBHD, that intro music is sick! Can we get a link of it?

U know what they say... &quot;Same Shit, different day&quot;.

What about the photoshop?

When I leave apps, my iPad doesn’t have the animation where it zooms out of that app. Idk why 

Best video on your channel 100%

marques if you download puffin you can go into desktop mode
Your middle name is Kayden

what the hell is that on bottom right corner at <a href="">8:34</a>

This is the most advanced iPad ever! I’m actually watching your video on my iPad rn.

apple should make like “padOS” or something for ipad

They had space for magnets but not the headphone Jack.

i can&#39;t afford it 
iPad OS is much needed. I switched my major from software development to soft skills and finance, so for the first time I can finally see how dexterity and convenient the iPad Pro 12.9&quot; is with a Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. It&#39;s pretty uncomfortable to carry a 15&quot; MBP all day.

The motion blur when swiping is terrible (unless that&#39;s just the 60hz on youtube).

LCD in a top 2018 tablet hahahaha

My middle nanme is  Kenny....  :V

Whats with that x ray vision shit

*&quot;plug in any mouse in the world and it won&#39;t do anything&quot; -&gt; technically true, the mice that work in some iPad apps are Bluetooth. Still giving you a strike. *&quot;all it will do is mirror the display&quot; - &gt; unless you have apps that run in dual screen, so, strike. *Nothing new with USB C. True. In fact the opposite is correct: you lose compatibility with some key accessories like Lightning flash drives. The new smart connector also loses you compatibility with the Logi Base dock. Not errors, just omissions, so, another strike.

Wow, fantastic video.

stick to ros

For me, Apple has the best tablets and the Pixel is my preferred phone.

Using total 9 times &quot;incredible&quot;.Well that&#39;s incredible

Incredible review.

I would like to have that to play pubg and roblox lmao.

Man if it had a mouse!

Phone:samsungTablet:apple
Great review but I haven&#39;t connected a camera sd via a cable for years simply for example wirelessly via  playmemories app for my Sony A7 ( I do that on my old iPad 4 !) But on the tablet itself , think I must now  &quot; go pro &quot;( hey that&#39;s a good product name hmmm:)

I think I’d buy a MacBook Air instead, an iPad that size is no use to me, and by the time you get the keyboard and pencil you have spent enough to buy a macbook

Theres a youtube studio app you know

I saw the middle name teaser!!!!!

But what’s your middle name?

Apple is so good at teasing you with products to come. Like this iPad Pro, it could have been perfect if Apple did this and that, but maybe the next iPad Pro will have the stuff I&#39;m missing from this version. This makes you want to buy the next iPad Pro even tho the one you own is pretty great.

It sucks sometimes when playing games

Doing a fake giveaway! Nobody will win cause ya know.. Its fake! Drop a LIKE for a chance to win absolutely NOTHING! Picking the winners in 5 years!  Dont miss out! 

It&#39;s cool and fast... but not seeing myself needing something like that, even if it was half the price, still not buying it...

I want to carry after seeing this... I want to play pubg mobile but my phone is potato ..expensive phone in my life is dream 

Watching on my maxed out 12.9 inch

wait there’s no headphone jack? you have to be joking

I swear to god this thing looks huge in video but then when I seen it in Best Buy it seemed small

You pay that much and your stuck with those ugly <b>BLACK</b> bezels.

Watching in a i pad pro
I&#39;m pretty sure this iPad was built with iOS 13 in mind, hopefully that will make it closer to a computer.

I like that studio look 

Literally everything you said you still need you laptop for ive never done and very likely to never do

Should i get a MacBook also

I just got my ipad pro 11inch and i can surely say is the best ipad ever.

where is the bend test lol!

Is anyone else just wondering what his middle name is??

Is your middle name is K’Chala ?

So I should get rid of my paperTablet 2?

Apple: Our new iPad can replace any laptop experience Samsung with Dex mode: Hold My Beer

I love the top you’re wearing where it from?

Anything matte black

I think i phone xi will not be having any charging cable.... No headphone jacks...quad camera etc

Im here after the 2018 cringe

Please give it to me for free please...

Try to bend it slightly see what happens 

his middle name is korey

What is a 9.7 ipad pro price for sprint plz

okay no but what is his middle name I&#39;m curious now

Nice lighting equipment! :)
APPLE will NEVER... cut out their own devices! In other words their never going to make the iPad as good as MacBook and Vice Versa! Sorry...but their more about money, then true consumer satisfaction!

Mark Ass Browne

I need to buy a tablet for my mum. Which one should i get, i am a tech freak but she is not. I like customisation but she prefers simplicity and less hassle. What to go for ? And any news on Samsung&#39;s new tablet ???

Watching this video on my iPad Pro

Bitch same ipaddddd!!!
The title of this video tells everything 

Ayaanipad
I currently own a 12.9” 3rd gen iPad Pro, and I can safely say it is one of the greatest pieces of technology I have ever saved up for. It’s a beautiful design and makes for a great sketchbook for drawing. Especially if you have a matte screen protector. It’s a great iPad.

Spin it on your finger like a fidget spinner

I am actually just 9 and i am watching this video on my own ipad 4
