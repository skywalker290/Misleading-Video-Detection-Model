What&#39;s weird is that Pewdiepie had already watched Jojo by the time this video was uploaded

blonde jacksepticeye

<a href="">0:56</a>You hear that? The jojo fans are typing. You’ve done this to yourself

You spelled epic in the title wrong

That was THE SECOND TIME FELIX SAID A ANIME WAS FULL METAL ALCHEMIST

Faker laughing at ninja haaahahah

JOSEPH JOESTAR: i can not belive you forgot me

every time full metal alchamist no its jojo

If a female gets fucking then she is a bitch
The phrase “it&#39;s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you&#39;ve lost twice. There&#39;s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

<a href="">3:49</a>Science

It’s from jojo

Pewdiepie was quarantining before it was cool

P

<a href="">0:53</a> PewDiePie doesn&#39;t know any JoJo reference.

<a href="">6:17</a> ahahshajs
The old LWIAY intro sounds so wrong Lol.

Awkward being tested 24 7 by people who dont have any answers :)

Should we tell him that a girl 

Pewdiepie isn&#39;t short, he just has different sizes of legs he uses

dio after he hears pewds called jjba fma :- wheres my roadroller pucci ?!

Ninja needs a lot go help-

im from fma

Pewdiepie i know probably like thousands have told you this and its been a year but im going to tell you anyways at <a href="">0:56</a> thats jojo bizarre adventure the ending to part 2 joseph is best jojo btw

Pffff peepeepoopoo jjba part 2 ending

<a href="">2:02</a> eh

i catch myself imitating felix accent at work when i get frustrated. i am a nurse so most of my patients are older and have no clue who you are. And when they hear me talkin like that they just look at me real funny. I&#39;ve gotten a couple of laughs tho.example: Patient doesn&#39;t want to take their blood pressure medication. male pt.me : * in my pewdiepie voice WHAT ? dont be a simp! just take it your bp is 180/100 .(now switched to anime voice) you must. or u have stroke. u no want that! Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m going to open up a whole new market for you. I&#39;m going to have senior citizens watching you soon.

<a href="">15:39</a> its &quot;The Revolution,&quot; get it right

Pbbppt THATS FROM JOJO how could you not know that

We all truly know the titanic sunk.... it hit a sweet backflip then hit an iceberg.

If ur wondering ,the tweet on the thumbnail  is &quot;peep Bopp dipp dopp bing bong bing ding dippy slippy peepy epicly Didi do do big pee pee pee poo poo poo&quot;

Pewdiepie said That if I say small pp Im saying big brain and his head grow, you understand??

The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice. There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

<a href="">3:49</a> did he really read that as science

<a href="">0:57</a> JOJO

PP 10!THATS LIKELY ABOUT AVERAGE!

The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset

Ninja wants to be a one of the best players: Korea has entered the chat

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Frasier should minecraft and niles terraria

I got a cat ad immediately after he said the meme at <a href="">12:04</a> lol

<a href="">6:54</a> I tought that he was emberassed bc he is groping his friend and thus cheating on Marzia

Pewds sees the fallout of calling every anime he doesn’t know full metal alchemist at <a href="">10:03</a>

PewDiePie: a random strangerThe person: almost 1 million subs now

<a href="">0:55</a> PFPPPPPPPPP THATS FROM JOJO

Coming from the future, it is shit

Holy shit is that a jojos reference

Hehehe I'm Mexican and they don't understand what I'm saying hahaha tacos
Did he just pronounced Wednesday as Wednesday?

That man is not a random guy who tweeted ninja,that is an insult to the mobile gamers

MY INTERNET IS FIXEDYES
BIG BRAIN NINJA

No Nut November is one of the dumbest and unhealthiest/unnatural things memeboys could come up with...

!giveitem devoiddreemur
Yes he watches drew!!

Man called JoJo fma

bruh kids these days who the hell gets like 500 dollars for their birthday.

Can you make a Pewdiepie hat please I would definitely buy it

How tf do u N O T see that “I will never forgive the Japanese” meme is from jojo, S I N N E R.   AAAAAAAAAAH

Floorgang
Who else watching this for the 23rd time this month?

After 7 months the Japanese was never forgiven by jojo, now excuse me while I bleach my mind

Pewdiepie: Really when Pewdiepie says small pp he meant big brain.Also Pewdiepie: I have big brain.

Its jojo.....
Pewdiepie is a good friend of ninja..He acknowledges him and then calls out his bullshit as well not like other trash talkers or yes men..He gives constructive criticism..

It’s mostly popcap that developed pvz

Ninja looks like that one vegan from the vegan challenge

Frikin general Shepard
<b>clearly says since</b>                                                                                                                                         Pewdiepie: “Science”

Felix is wrong, pp 10 is actually kinda small because pp = 10 + your perception modifer. I actually have an 18 and wisdom and proficiency in perception so i have a +6 making my pp 16

<a href="">0:54</a> Where does that come from?7 months later: <b>wears JoJo shirt for 2 weeks</b>

Felix: &quot;Is that Fulmetal Alchemist?&quot; Us JoJo fans: <b>7 Page Muda</b>

<a href="">02:25</a> he felt better watching pewdiepie because he knew that he at least have legs

<a href="">10:37</a> &quot;Isn&#39;t it epic how you can joke about communism, but not the other bad thing?&quot;Exactly. Ikr.

Why does pewdiepie this that every anime meme he doesn&#39;t know is from full metal alchemist

we don&#39;t mention the bridge

Craaaaaaaap
<a href="">0:57</a> thats jojo i think

<a href="">10:33</a> is hemoglobin supposed to be spelt as haemoglobin?

101

Wait wait wait So pewds called the person that robbed his house small pp. BUT earlier in the video he also said that plot twist small pp means big brain.

You what else is embarrassing? Blocking out a word just to not block it out 10 seconds later Floor gang ahooh

Bonk Bonk...

I really hope he was Jokong because he makes so many jokes about jojos, and went on a rant about how Joesph cusses in English very obnoxiously

Pewdiepie that is jojo

haha i dont have sticky keys because im no pussy and i can teabag people in minecraft all i want

Yare Yare Daze
It’s JOJO Reeeee

The guy that responded on ninja&#39;s tweet was ducky, another fricking pro fartnite gamer lol

Pewds just casually sprinkling in the fact that he watches Drew Gooden

Is that a Jojo’s reference?

Pewdiepie stairs are going to become a pilgrimage site for future floor gang religion

Finally I’ve been called one again

<b>Frogs have legs</b><b>Biology students</b>Chop chop

That&#39;s Jojo

Pewdiepies editor is the fucking <b>(5 seconds later)</b> <b>*****</b> best

That boy reminds me of meee peopleee, well, I broke my head, I had a craneoencefalic trauma,  that got me paralyzed for 6 months, and as he said, had to learn to walk, me too, it was so hard, thinking you’re useless, I got depressed, I had to learn how to speak, it was hard, so hard, he is like me, I don’t think that others would understand, the pain of being trapped in your body for a long time, I tried a lot of things to stop my suffering, but I started thinking that was so lucky to be alive with a 98.2 of dying, I worked hard, I worked hard to be here, happy, enjoying my life, even tho I was pretty bad for 8months, I’m still in my rehabilitation, well, we stopped because of covid-19, hey in my channel, there’s a video of me, how I surpassed my challenges, thank you Felix, you brought me lots of fun, while depressed, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, you helped me too, love you guys.

Controversial opinion, I know, but I actually agree with Ninja.

<a href="">3:20</a> irs the titanic

Ninja is a grown man playing a game targeted for kids 6-12 year olds and when someone tweets at him for being ignorant and stupid he then implies that fortnite is a harder sport than football because he has to edit,build,rotate, and shoot my guy do you really see how stupid you look

Poor Marzia also felt bad for being upset she was robbed. She is too pure, there is a difference in being upset what you had is gone and being upset that you can&#39;t have more possessions. Being sad that a bunch of stuff was stolen from you is not materialistic, being mad that you don&#39;t have enough is.

I love how he&#39;s like &#39;it&#39;s december&#39; yada yada to the joker meme (to say it should be dead) but still laughs at the FoRtNiTe BaD mInEcRaFt GoOd memes which were a thing a year ago.

I dont know why, but I liked that game trailer at the end..

Soo TRUE  <a href="">10:35</a>

You can&#39;t joke about &quot;other bad thing&quot; because commies won the war and victors write the history. If &quot;the other nad guys&quot; would win communism would be banned from jokes. Its almost that simple in nutshell

Pewds making the office reference at <a href="">1:16</a>,

The reason kickers can&#39;t make it all the time is sometimes because of the wind or their quarterback can&#39;t set the ball right to kick it perfectly so it isn&#39;t always the kickers fault How many times Ninja has been a dumbass | | |v

Ninja:&quot;(Makes a bad tweet)&quot;Me:&quot; <b>I&#39;ll allow it.</b> &quot;

It’s Jojo at the beginning
