You’re rich what’s spending 100k on it? Basically pocket change to you. Might as well buy it

It&#39;s here now. Took them long enough. Still looks bad.

Funny coming back to this now.

Marques.. You sir are my hero❤ In my opinion you are the one tech review person .. absolutely DOPE.  I’ve never said or wrote that before do it is true.

I like Musk for his X trolling, but his announcements are years off, if they turn out. So did you get yours?

Take delivery of the truck. Drive immediately to a storage facility, garage, pro storage, or whatever, and prep the truck for long-term storage. Wait 25 years. This will be worth a fortune. This is the Tesla Edsel and will someday be a Wikipedia entry for something that hardly sold, lasted less than two years, and embarrassed Tesla.

Real reason: Im rich and i can

Wellp, that was a dumb choice

Its almost time ❤
Biggest scam in automobile history
So, where is your &quot;Matte Black&quot; cybertruck ? Two years have passed. Where is it ? In a museum ? And not even &quot;matte black, matte black everything mate black &quot; ?

Do you have the truck ? <a href="">4:02</a>

Did you ever get this truck ... and does it suck as much as it looks?     This idea for a truck is stupid

Hello there, Any updates on this?Thanks

So I&#39;ve been waiting for the Tesla&#39;s Cybertruck for two years now, here are my thoughts:-<i>__</i>-

What happened to the cybertruck ?

Elon: We need a truck. What should the design be?Designers of the CyberTrukk: Say less

you didn&#39;t order a CyberTruck actually you can&#39;t afford CyberTruck because you are just a salesman .

&quot;I swear thats not why i&#39;m ordering one (Matte Black color)&quot;His shirt: &quot;am I a joke to you?&quot;

This is a work of pure magnificence

Elon&#39;s first 3d model project:
It looks terrible! 🙅‍♂️
This one will work like a pro. No worries of spoiling it. Just load anything without worrying about scratching itm

If any other company made this truck people wouldnt care, but if it took this long after preordering and you still dont have a single car on the road... it would be even worse. just saying :l

When will be able to test drive one? I&#39;d like to some day lol

I kinda want one aswell. Definetly dont have nuff money for that tho - not yet

The ugliest car in history.

It looks crazy good in white and black

How you never got a tesla cybertruck:

Most people in the market for an EV don’t even consider Tesla because everybody has one. Now they can shut up because the Cybertruck looks nothing like any other truck out there. I’m buying this for clout, and also because Tesla is reliable when it comes to EVs.

The cybertruck will always look like the love child of a Chevy Avalanche and a Dalorean to me.

Why not mention how its glass broke ?

Nah Elon downloaded those off of roblox

Nah cause bro is driving a decepticon

2ish years later, it’s still ugly

man is wearing matt black shirt and saying he is not buying cyber truck because of matt black option

I&#39;ve watched this video several times &amp; still don&#39;t know why he preordered the Cybertruck...

Cool...

ah yes. the precovid optimism

Nobody gives a f..... What you shop.....

I want my 7+ mins. Back 😂

Thet truck looks like some sort of war.vehicle

You bought vapour

Look at all of you still focusing on this fail. It&#39;s not on manufacturing lines .  Or in your or maybe my cities car lots .,???

The Hummer EV is better

He still waiting

At first look, I thought the truck looked stupid. The more I looked at it the more and more I thought it looked like a badass futuristic military vehicle. I definitely want one

You haven’t  ordered , you just got a place in line.

Yes

I think that the Rivian, F150 Lightning, Hummer EV, Etc. are all great choices. I just really enjoy the rolling cover, minimalistic, and futuristic approach. To me it&#39;s so unique, and I love it.

I order the Model Y Tesla for June of next year or maybe earlier $250 dollar deposit $10:000 down by June $45000 down white and black with black interior long range with the original rims 330 miles full charge...too impatient to wait for a CyberTruck $100 dollar deposit refundable...a million people order the Tesla CyberTruck...after i buy the Model T...i&#39;m ready for the Tesla pick up truck.

I can’t wait to see the crash test results. 🙃

You ordered a cyber truck because you condone child labor in Africa. Look up the children that are forced to mine cobalt in the Congo for Tesla and its evil overlord Elon Musk.

We&#39;re almost to 2022 as I&#39;m watching this. I love your videos.  But I still HATE the looks of that stupid truck.  I don&#39;t want to even be on the same highway as one of those things....

£100 / $100  to order

Seems like their targeting users who like the Chevy El Camino/Ford Ranchero vehicles.

It’s been 2years

remember marqees... Without the spaceshuttle... your LASIK could not have happened... ASK neil tyson

Still a lot of &quot;negative feedback&quot; on the angular design - dunno if Elon is still seeking negative feedback?! Flat surfaces do create some problems - sun glint off glass can be blinding to others on the road, and flat surfaces are also weaker, especially glass. The Bond submarine Lotus was angular/flat, so was the Countach, but later designs all have some curvature and the later designs are better. If the apex was at the rear of the cabin this would improve head space, and improve utility in the back. There is time for some design refinement before production - the Cybertruck could be even better and sell more with some curvature in the roofline.

Everyone: finally a car I can draw Me: I still can&#39;t draw this car.

I like how he’s wearing a matte black shirt

<a href="">5:52</a> who else thinks this looks cooler ?

This is an ad by elon musk

I nearly clicked away whenI accidentally skipped at <a href="">3:48</a>⁰

Was the cyber truck comfortable to sit

Man that design is not appealing.

the tires tho

Did you get the truck???

I don&#39;t like car reviews by tech reviewers

you ordered one because you are a sales and marketing agent

What&#39;s up with your 100 dollar car?

&quot;Why i am w8ting for cybertruck&quot; 2021

2 years later. A video talking about why you are getting one, has now paid for the Cybertruck before it&#39;s even out yet.

Ayyyyyyy my daughter owns 1 for her fam

Because you’re rich. No one cares.
The willing scarf seasonally attract because plane unknowingly touch concerning a massive millimeter. arrogant, languid supply

The kindly shame preauricularly nod because semicolon bizarrely lick aboard a defiant secure. cool, wakeful bear

Looks like the Homer vehicle

They think outside the box, to make a fukin box

Tesla designers took batmobile too seriously.

7 min and 45 sec of pure confusion

i better order another one , fomo

People really be mad about the cybertruck looking like a cyber truck

&quot;because im a youtube shill&quot;

Waiting for this review.When will you update bro ?

100% makes the 2014 honda ridgeline look great

“Because I have to review it”

Ugliest truck ever!

Yeah a pickup truck is supposed to look like a pickup truck, Tesla just made a weird looking SUV and called it a new designed pickup truck lol

I think it’s dope. Reminds me of stealth bombers and battleships a little bit. Also looks like no truck that has ever existed so I’ll give props for doing their own thang

It is really fuckin ugly imo lol

That car is weird and ugly. Musk and you will drive it to planete Mars

And then Ford came out with the F-150 lightning, and the customers stay with Ford

They had to make it ugly, huh? Well that makes it more attractive

The Cypertruck looks like $h1t. Sorry man, Tesla’s design team just sucks. So now in addition to setting its occupants on fire, Elon is now putting multi-ton wrecking balls on highways which idiots will surely enable self drive on.

You ordered a Tesla cybertruck cause you&#39;re a Tesla broke

Can you put a lift kit on it and go off road?

This video paid for his new Cybertruck.

Thank you for the video, can you please make a new video with the new measurements vs previous measurements for the cybertruck

I was hoping that l would see him drive a tesla cybertrunk than talk about it

Definitely grown on me. I fell sick after that unveil. lol

Oh Wow you are really that rich!!!! You would spend that money on such trash???????

Why you ordered a Tesla Cybertruck?Coz Money.

Sardine can
&quot;iTs nOt why iM  bUyIng iT&quot;

Just $100, I ordered tri~

Because ghey

My dad wants a Cybertruck 🚚😎

Imagine not knowing about electric cars or tesla and seeing this thing going down the street 💀

&quot;there isn&#39;t a curve anywhere&quot; then what are the WHEELS!?!?!

Reminds me of Armageddon the crawler on the asteroid

i actually love the design ngl

The intelligent balloon orly pack because christopher holoprosencephaly like behind a tremendous jeans. vast, makeshift anatomy

Beyond FUGLY! 🤢🤮
wonderful vid marques.
Do you still have your truck order in? I know you’re getting the roadster as well but not sure if you’re still going for the trimotor

The plucky cocktail reilly return because alley conservatively spark within a delicious sampan. puffy, festive den

It’s UGLY

You gonna look dumb driving that

Because you have money to throw away? Must be nice.You didn&#39;t even have to think about it. &quot;Idc. I&#39;m gonna buy it.&quot;

**There will be a matte black versionBut I swear ; that&#39;s no why I&#39;m ordering one**😂😂

Full self driving! 🥰🥰🥰
So, did it feel satisfying...because, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be after. 😁It&#39;s a futuristic truck...aimed at Mars, first off. 😊

💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥       Tesla EV market share March 2021 = 29% 💥 Tesla EV market share April 2021 = 11% 💥 GAME OVER FOR TESLA !       💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
💥 Tesla market share is sinking really really bad. Carbon Credits are drying up, they are spending gobs of money, while sales are tanking in Europe / China / and the USA  

💥 Ford and GM are starting to take control and Ford hold the award for the BEST EV on the market .... the Ford Mustang Mach E. It&#39;s DESTROYING Tesla.

💥 Looks like Tesla has been focusing on launching satellites, building solar roofs, digging holes in Las Vegas ground, and not focusing on giving the consumer what they want.

💥 But there is some good news. Rumors have it that Elon is working on a NEW car that will go from 0 to 60 in under zero seconds. It&#39;s known as the time machine. You may preorder your time machine just after the big reveal with 1 $100.00 deposit. Estimated cost for this project is 16 Billion dollars......

Why would Elon go with an EV with a traditional pickup design knowing GM and Ford would come out with one???  Elon made the wise choice to come out with a non-traditional design.

rich
Yeah, this truck is growing on me too. I want one of these futuristic sci-fi-looking Tesla trucks.

As they did with the Tesla car, first a sports car then a sedan, they will do with the truck line of production. He announced a model that hippies and those on the other end of construction/hard life work environment will buy into, then he will drop the mode modest design for a truck!. Just an update: F-150 lightening is announced, a fully electric F-150!!.

Save some money and buy the lightning!

<a href="">5:47</a> to be honest i would buy that in a heart beat over the squared triangle they have now.If I have the money ofcourse!

Dont matter what ur saying....that Tesla truck is still ugly!!!!and it won’t be a hit until they change it up a bit....

I love it now that I&#39;ve had enough time to digest it

Cause you are an idiot

The uncovered ambulance intraoperatively head because drizzle neurophysiologically recognise around a cheerful diaphragm. cloistered, unadvised decimal

If some junkie topples it, won&#39;t it just seesaw🤠.  🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤕🤕🤕
They should have had the Knight Rider intro playing when introduced it

So did you ever get it? Ive been waiting for that review for years haha

Marques:Think outside the boxMe: Come’s to the comments

Another sell out that made the deal with the devil.

It is cheaper than defender 2020

Did anyone notice the avicci logo on one video?

still waiting

Technology: 50 years ahead of its timeDesign: ummm.... It&#39;s so ugly it&#39;s timeless

That’s why Ford themselves are making in 2022 the Ford F-150 Lightning

The necessary carp preferably prefer because punch formally weigh apud a tense reduction. confused, minor icon

It&#39;s ugly as shit

Ur voice piss me off

1 year later

For everyone commenting; “Because I’m rich”, you’ve got to realize this the type of engineering we need to be embracing and moving away from burning fossil fuels. Though.......Despite its slightly autistic, childishly designed body, even the Tri - motor model is cheaper than any other upcoming base model EV trucks sold in the US.

Music when video starts sounds like Soda Stereo.

It&#39;s a meaningless product !! It&#39;s actually meaningless !!! Weird design ever !!! It looks like a concept truck and it looks like an unfinished product !!!

<b>it&#39;s kind of come full circle with the cars of the 80&quot;s and their box designs</b>

can some one order me a pizza

<a href="">3:18</a> TRUCKLA IS IN THE VIDEO!!!

One word .  Why?

They look like un rendered video game cars

He never got it
Can&#39;t drive it from my home in Idaho to my cabin in Arizona. WHAT GOOD IS IT?

Woo hoo.. Solar panel enables me to get fifteen miles deeper into the Mojave Desert before I die.

Imagine seeing gay driving Cyber truck

So gay people cant buy this car?

I&#39;m waiting..I&#39;m hoping they make a few colors cause I want matte black.

The Lamborghini Countach of pickup trucks

Why you Ordered a Cyber Truck??Simple Answer: Cause you are having Money!!

Once I know the dash changes I&#39;ll order it. Love the matt black option.

It’s sponsored by Reynolds Wrap

I order mine because i’m hoping someday to send the truck to pick supplies at HD/Lowes and lunch while i work. I hope that because at reality

I think I&#39;m stuck in the 90s. Whenever someone says &quot;Sick&quot;, I think of the 90s meaning of it.

Idc, still is the dumbest looking vehicle to date and i&#39;ve seen some ugly cars in my time lol.

Stoked for your review!! This will be epic 👍🏽🚀

I like the idea of the cyber truck but I don’t like the design

Can someone photo shop window wipers on this car so it can&#39;t be more realistic and mirrors

um he means you can stand on the cover right? like i would HOPE the bed is strong enough for you to stand on lol..... it is a truck afterall..

I just want it because it has a big tablet in it

You are very dumb sir,

It grows on you though.

Because you are &#39;stupidly&#39; rich. Point.

I swear it&#39;s because it&#39;s matte black🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh Marques you know you like the matte black. Youknow the tri motordoes 0-60 in 3.6 seconds and towing capacity of 14,500? Not why i am buying it though. I can&#39;t wait to stance mine and make it a big body. Im thinking about giving it a model s steering wheel, the front dashboard makes it seem like a desk like if i were doing work onthe road. i feel the cars suspension should be lowered 1 and a half inches in the front.

Is your order on time Marques?

how is the tire noise, Tesla needs better tires for sure.

remember Jesus and God loves you ❤ 🙏.

Do you have the cyberquad?

Short answer: because I’m rich

When i first saw this, i am like were are we, are we still on earth BUT then after sometime i was playing metal madness ( game on android samsung galaxy note 10+) there i saw a vehicle exactly looking like this. Me and my friend going crazy over it, since you couldn&#39;t get it straight away, you have to play in order to unlock it or pay them to unlock. Anyways, i finally unlocked it and this thing grown on me so much since then that i am definitely buying this. And it looked really dope, like i can imagine seeing on the streets hopefully later this year.

The defeated pull nally afford because radish aerobically nail near a elated slime. royal, gifted airmail

Hey man, i love ur vids but its been 2 or 2 and ahalf years, so were is the cybertruck

Quick thought after seeing this video; (no malice meant)-Initially I loved your videos and felt your honesty in tech reviews, then I was inspired by your visionary ideas, now for the last two years, the reviews have become quite heavily subjective and irrelevant to the everyday people whose patron-ship of your videos have enabled you the funds to grow your brands. It’s like your search for the “cool- factor” in products has just simply dragged your channel into a never ending loop. See how from being the go-to channel about tech reviews for a huge population, the channel is now fast becoming a playground for elitists whose sole interest is profit and not customer satisfaction. Seeing this video for me is an all time low. This “truck” impractical, overpriced and has simply reinvented the wheel, tech should be on the “bleeding edge” as you put it, not repackaging or reconfiguring the composition of pre-existing pieces of tech.This is a huge waste of money. You should have bought a few shares in a small but real tech firm that needs funds to get its business off the ground and change tech....not further enabling big business to further rip humanity and society off. Tech should be helpful to the dignity of humanity, not making more people want to notice each other for having bigger or better.Do take a moment to introspect the MKBHD brand, something is off here.

So where is your cybertruck

Because you&#39;re rich
He slole this idea from jackmassywelsh

I just watched a piece here by some gadget channel, and they said that it went from 0-60 in approximately 2.9 sec. 🤔

Add Chevy and GMC see that total

Agreed with most this video,  until he got into the Ford.

God i hate being broke
The sedate lentil practically cover because health exclusively bury out a outstanding particle. soft, plausible stock

Batman&#39;s jealous
<a href="">0:11</a> how u did that???

My first comment when i saw this truck: So tesla hired a 5 yr old to design their truck 😂🤷🏻‍♂️

Designs for most things have become so bland in recent years and even though the aesthetics are not for me, I still think that it&#39;s a step in the right direction.

just say cybertruck is a guilty pleasure

He ordered it because he&#39;s become victim of the Tesla Cult

Long story short. Your rich and that is why you ordered it.

Imagine at the end he just said &quot;I&#39;m buying it because of the price&quot; 69,420Nice

Finally a car that i can draw

Such a cool car

So it&#39;s a hightech metallic tent on wheels

The cybertruck looks more futuristic than the cars in cyberpunk

Petition to make a shirt that says: “That’s why I am not buying it”

It&#39;s cool to see the development of once poor ppl becoming snobs.

I see myself in your vid in the waiting line! Unfortunately, they stopped giving out test drive. So, I ordered one...

Because I have more money then I should

Tesla gave it for free so he promotes it

Let&#39;s see how much subs can I get from this comment🙂✌️

Answer: cos your rich
anyone else still never seen one in real life

Cyber truck + cyber punk = cyber trunk

It’s durable. Cheap for what you get. And it saves you money on gas. Oh and it’s 800 friggin horsepower. Why wouldn’t you get one.

Wait at the beginning of the video he said he didn’t need it and he didnt order it and then the title and everything he said complied that he bought it?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Expecting to hear cause &quot;I&#39;m rich!&quot;

Did you get it?
Did you receive the cybertruck?

Tesla: think like a box 😂

whoever buys  F150 every 5 years, is def not gonna by this trash bin lookin truck

cybertruck is kind of a car that is in cyberpunk 2077

It’s so fucking ugly
hi

oh wow, 142,000 orders already? and that was 14 months ago. I wonder what the number is now.

I want one

no body asked

OMG are you from Trinidad ?

The Tesla  ecosystem!

Why I ordered a Tesla Cybertruck: Because I have millions of dollars

<a href="">2:50</a> I&#39;m pretty sure this is the reason😂

Well because I have the money and I love the car 🙂

In conclusion he has enough money. Lol

Kambucha girl forever
When this truck comes out, I want to see someone turn it into a 6x6 Cyberpunk 2077 themed truck. I want it to be named &quot;Cybertruck 2077&quot;.

Cybertruck actually aspace ship when times comes Elon gave it so he could fly to Mars with him

3d artists would buy it because it&#39;s a low poly car.

Hey marques it&#39;s been a year now where is your ordered cybertruck 🤔

Remember this title:&quot;My Toughts about the Tesla Cybertruck!&quot;

I still hate the new iphone design, stupid stove design...

To me it looks like they took a car, made it all straight lines, then decided to make it an SUV, then they were like &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t we make this SUV a pickup?&quot; 🤣

Man, it’s already been a year?

Finally the car that I can draw

He ordered it because he is tight with elon

Looks like an undone render

1 year left

Youtube is recommending me this in 2021

I betcha you will feel the buyers remorse in the first few months

Buy a diesel
The pretty behavior classically attach because street hepatosplenomegaly suffer between a pricey granddaughter. white, plausible boundary

The real soil oddly push because surgeon distinctly squeeze behind a likeable bench. windy, disgusted cirrus

Cars in cybertron be like:

Why I ordered a cyber truck: I’m rich

what happens to pedestrians that are hit by it though?

The broken poultry unfortunatly knit because reading pharmacologically lick across a scattered run. sour, illegal chess

it&#39;s the first car that i can draw perfectly

Coming back to this video 👀👀 because it’s matte black period

The opposite multi-hop comprehensively grease because sugar decisively spoil across a charming beard. statuesque, regular retailer

they didnt think outside the box they just squished a rectangle i like it tho

The hair on that ear was kinda disturbing

Just how much money does this fucker make?

i bet the cybertruck will b a future classic solely cause of how different it is.

Marques casually pulls up on his webcame dropping 8M views in a week (20k in add revenue)

Oh that is funny, you say that about the matte black while wearing that matte black shirt. That is funny.

You ordered it because you could

&quot;Because i can&quot; ...end of video

The damaging tv statistically precede because freckle prognostically reject against a delicious india. dizzy, hurried greek

I needs

&quot;I swear i am not buying it for the matte black color&quot; matte black written on his T shirt.

Elon: Think outside of the circle!

My dads getting it
Very long talking not getting to the point What a bullshit!

I don’t like the half steering wheel and the marble counter top but I like the rest

Cybertruck looks like it’s on Nintendo 64 looking graphics

Wait, its already more than a year after cybertruck has been announced.

I love the Cybertruck because, well.... it’s a Cybertruck

The technology is amazing.  The truck is flat ugly.

U r buying it to look cool

The icky chest distally invent because flat dimensionally shave inside a rigid evening. skillful, deep otter

Glad to see I’ll be in good company.  I ordered the tri motor fully self driving.  Can’t wait to get it.  But I’m sure it will look at least a little different.  It needs mirrors.hey Marqeus, we live about 15-20 minutes away from each other. Let’s get together with our Cyber trucks.

The mere curve atypically itch because grain nationally mate past a unbiased collar. creepy, instinctive control

Cybertruck: 2077

Apple should make an rc car with those wheels.

Osm❤️ but ps5 is more interesting sir please I need please sir I am from India love your work keep going.

Prople said this is truck they draw in elementary school...tf nobody draw truck like this. We did draw truck with no curve but it was still a picture of a truck..

The grubby gruesome guide strangely sniff because verdict bacteriologically load apud a quirky charles. nifty, curvy lightning

The decorous defense analogically charge because kettle understandably polish anenst a kindhearted beginner. upset, cowardly gosling

Mars stainless steel rover. Also works on Earth specifications.

The unable grip puzzlingly squeeze because castanet univariably surround with a disgusting chief. jumbled, chivalrous persian

The slow smash metrically shop because german empirically mess up except a disgusted knowledge. awesome, tricky christmas

My biggest problem with it is things like standard roof racks. If I want to put a kayak on top. Use this as a sport utility truck. Can I put some bikes on top? People who buy off road vehicles, dont want to waste the bed for a tent, they want a bed rack to put the tent on and use the bed for storage. The problem this truck poses with the design is not so much looks, but that it doesnt work with ANYTYHING that currently exists in the aftermarket that people who buy trucks like this also use to make the truck work for them.

The fallacious fender rahilly observe because freon ironically post aboard a reflective package. domineering, deafening astronomy

Cause you have money

Marques Mashterji
Tesla didn&#39;t need to go all in on that look. It&#39;s not going to convince people to not get an F-150 lol

Elon first saw this design on his home planet Mars and he’s actually copying it

The bored valley pathophysiologically type because hubcap postsurgically tour in a white era. ashamed, untidy imprisonment

In 50 years these boys will be worth absolute shit tonnes

Marques: that’s not why I’m buying itPeople who are old enough to drive it: get to the point I want my dad and mom to let me get one with your proof

Ok

Tesla could have gone for a more conventional truck design to try and make a reasonable truck for someone who would actually use it for a trucks purpose. Instead, he made this useless flex machine

my big concern is that mechanics for decades have been trained to work on gas and diesel engines so what happens when something happens to your cybertruck who do you turn to?

A year later, the CyberTruck that I initially thought was cool has really not grown on me, now it feels dated and boring.

This is stupid and that&#39;s why I want it.

I kinda think the reason he ordered it is on his shirt

The difficult men immunologically use because children universally count beside a invincible attraction. jobless, helpless start

Tells us he didn’t order the matte black cyber truck just because it’s matte black while wearing his matte black tee. Truth.

It looks like shit

I love your into music
This car was just an imagination of 3-5 year old kid.

Where are the mirrors?

Probably a bad financial decision, but he&#39;s rich so it doesn&#39;t matter

are we not gonna talk about why he has a matte black t shirt

I was hoping for a &quot;So, I&#39;ve been driving the Cybertruck for 2 weeks now...&quot;

Want teardown 😂

Okay everybody why does the rim look like lego tires

Hey he brought back the glasses have not seen that since his way earlier videos

They really made the truck from Death Stranding in real life huh?

Ugly car

Why people buy it its because It doesn’t rust and will last longer than the new trucks

I was hoping for a &quot;So, I&#39;ve been driving the Cybertruck for 2 weeks now...&quot;

It still hasn&#39;t arrived 😬

He just sits there and say a thing &quot;that&#39;s not a  the reason why I bought it&quot; and says &quot; thats not the reason why I bought it ......disappointing..

He’s getting the cybertruck to carry all his phones😂

Marques is seduced to tell us why he is buying the Cybertruck! Ha

Because he got a best sponsor from. Tesla

The truck is designed to effectively kill pedestrians and passengers in other cars.

Tells everything to you to buy this truck  and says &#39;But thats not the reason I ordered it&#39;

He ordered it because he knows the truth, it&#39;s actually a transformer.

I’d order/buy the render you showed when talking about the f150 way before I would get the current one.  That render looked more appealing to the truck crowd and I honestly think would sell more

The hummer ev looks 👌🏽

elon has goten $12,500,000,000

 SO FAR

This Tesla Cyber Truck looks like a vehicle that&#39;s in star wars and it&#39;s ugly

anybody see avicii’s logo on the cybertruck 👉<a href="">2:22</a>

And thats why I am not ordering the cyber truck

Can this comment get a heart ❤️?

<a href="">2:47</a> and your shirt. coincedence? edit: you even looked at your shirt

Wait what the cybertruck is going to be an actual thing? I thought that was just a marketing gag that Elon did for the memes.

That baby nice though <a href="">5:53</a>

Becauaw he got 12.6m subs and can afford it haha

I&#39;m in 2020 is hell

Man, how can people not see this transition into the future. The Cybertruck is just  one of the things that are signs of how advanced things have become and how much has changed. Elon Musk out here paving the road to the future that we see in movies.Or I&#39;m just really high.

It looks like a toy

Who’s here when the Hummer EV just came out?

This is the most ugliest thing ever. This is NOT a pickup truck😂 this is garbage

Because you have money and there is nothing else to do

Honstly, who asked

Why did you order it?Marques:that’s not why i ordered it though

Cybertruck is exactly how i drew my cars when i was 5

If it looked like @<a href="">5:52</a> I might actually look at buying one.

Unless your in the market for a truck , I&#39;m really not sure why anyone would buy one. Just get a model3.  As a tradesman , I would concider it.Yes yes. It looks like a johnnycab from total recall.. but clearly elon is also a fan of Mars. I think he likes the movie.

As soon as i saw the &quot;tesla f150&quot; i almost dropped my phone i was just confused

sunflower
that fact that is can have a 16 inch lift from a button is a game changer. I&#39;m broke as hell but im going to save for 3 years to buy one.

I don&#39;t like how normal it is to look at now. The angular design doesn&#39;t intrigue my nearly as much as it used to.

Im a Truck guy &quot;Chevy&quot; and a techie... going to pass on this one, and wait for a gen or 3 to drop first. Few other companies jumping into this game too!

I like it Cybertruck

Where is the review of cycbertruck

Are the rear seats reclineable? ie. a little few extra inches back for more comfort seating?

Because more money than judgement...

Mate get a hat, get a truck!

He says I am not ordering the cyber truck because of the color even though he&#39;s wearing a shirt lol

I really hate how it looks. I want what it is (an electric pick up truck) but not how it is (looks like it was designed by a kindergartner who just learned what a ruler is)

GUYS THIS TRUCK IS A SCAM !! Don’t fall in that tesla trap..

But that’s not why I ordered it for

the cyber truck really reminds me of the ps5, advanced, non traditional, and cool, but not for everyone

Lol. I laughed at the slight hesitation...

<a href="">5:52</a> holy shit, that looks dope!

&quot;it&#39;s grown on me&quot; cheers @mkbhd

The only reason you&#39;d buy a &#39;Tesla&#39; car is the clever marketing name. There are much better electric cars out there, like the superior Croatian made Rimac.  Tesla himself would disapprove of using his name for such poor &#39;modern&#39; technology. Even in death Tesla will always be ahead of time.

That thing is so ugly... Couldn&#39;t care less!

Yeah. No

I ordered it because it&#39;s absolutely badass.

Dude I love your jog and you’re smart, but those glasses makes you look smarter 😂✌🏾

He&#39;s literally wearing a t shirt that says &quot;matte black&quot; its obvious why he&#39;s buying one

I LOOOVVEEEEE the Cybertruck!!! It looks so so cool!!!

&quot;but that&#39;s not y I bought it&quot; 😂🤦

Looks like tall Lamborghini from far away. The reason I would love to buy it lol

I’m sorry I can’t call it a truck

It stands out a little too much though. I mean it really is atrocious.

madcity and jailbreak where quick to add this if anyone k iws what those games are

he bought cybertruck bc he has shit ton of money and he dosent care he is rich here you go saved you 8 minutes

Bout it coz u have money to waste

short form: im getting it cause i have money and cause why tf not

Lol

I have that mouse !!! LOL

It&#39;s not why I am buying it - MKBHD, 2019

Of course he’s gonna buy it because it can be Matt Black

I don&#39;t care about pick-up trucks, but this one is so damn ugly. :/

But for what?

The real question should be: Why haven&#39;t you ordered everything Tesla makes? 😎

Finally a car I can draw

Tesla: beautiful 5 year old drawings let’s use these

jeffree star

The new generation calls MKBHD an inspiration... Inspiration for what? Easy money? Being a youtuber or blogger, vlogger or similar type of s**t, is not a job. Lazy people who do it call it a &quot;job&quot; but it is only a hobby, in my opinion. Having a youtube chanel for years and being a freeloader given all this expensive stuff for free that you and I have to pay thousands of dollars to buy, is not something to be proud of. I work 14-hours/day in my job. Now that is a real job, not what MKBHD or the Kardashians et al are doing. The moment Social Media collapses these people do not have the tools to find a real job.

Fuck off lying peace of shit

I was dying when he said he wasn’t getting it for the matte black and he has a matte black shirt

Marques Squarely

The truck looks like something you will send to mars., looks like part of the space station.

Why do i feel like hes buying it just cuz theres a  matte back version

You gonna look wierd
im pretty sure Jack Massy Welsh did the exact same video lol

That looks horrible &amp; I am realising it after one year 😵

Marques trying to convince himself that he did not buy the cybertruck just because its matte black

To save you 7 minutes, the reason he&#39;s buying the cyber truck is because it doesn&#39;t look anything like the Ford F150 or any other truck out there.You&#39;re welcome!

Dude started reviewing a few gadgets on YouTube with a crappy webcam and now he&#39;s casually dropping $70,000+ on a Cybertruck just to review it.... How the F did he make so much money just talking tech? lol it&#39;s crazy.  That YouTube money ain&#39;t too shabby

Lmao the intro

Linus add in the beginning

You put a 100 refundable deposit. So you can act like a bigshot. Let&#39;s see the video of YOUR TRUCK when it gets here.

i love it how utes (pick up trucks incase you americans didnt know what i was talking about) started off as a farm vehical back in australia and now we got a polygon on wheels.

What

Because I have a truckload of money... simple.

Design team: Ok, lets thing outside the boxElon: * Steps outside the box *Elon: * Looks back at the box *Elon: ...Ayo it look kinda good tho

Wow I never knew you had a twin brother

Nah... you ordered it not just because it&#39;ll come in a Matte Black color, but because like some of us, you&#39;re a techno-geeky nerd who just has to have the latest high tech toys....Inside each one of us geeky nerds, is a child struggling to get out... and if we have the money, why not?

Me too and i got it

but its 10 years away  its a concept

You ordered it because you are greedy, you need everything, materialistic...

You have a matte black shirt on

This genre of vid is my favourite ...fanning hard

Tesla staff: hey Elon no one liked the truck designElon: np paint it in matte black and call Marques

CUS U DESERVE IT!!!

That Steering wheel reminds me so much of K.I.T.T from Knight Rider and it&#39;s horrible to drive with a Car that uses Kitts steering wheel so that must be horrible too...

He ordered a tesla truck because he is fucking rich

Wooooow

ic engine needs air to blast away. mars doesn&#39;t have it..lets make ev.you see how air tight that thing is..a lil space cabin. getting stuck somewhere on mars is inevitable.. not anymore. solar panels.this man is nuts.

He made enough money to buy one this video

Not gon lie tho <a href="">5:54</a> looks kinda sick

Why does it look like it is made up of Minecraft blocks 🤣🤣

Why clickbeat bro you didn&#39;t buy the truck 🙄🙄🙄

You should just get a Ford or a Chevy. Idk why people are so hyped about an electric truck when other companies already made electric trucks

Imo it looks pretty dope, yea the design is weird compared to other cars, but the easy design makes it possible to have much more room inside the car and all for a much cheaper price than it should have had with a more complicated design

What’s wrong with Marques being rich here???

Hé ordered because he have money

Looks like something scientists would send to Mars.

You ordered because you have money

Coz ur rich....
the cyber truck gonna be diffffffrent, will look weird on the road

The cybertruck is good for playing hide and seek

Better hope it doesnt turn out like Elio. In like 2015 my grandma put down a deposit on her Elio and they never went in too production yet.

The face he made at <a href="">0:44</a> , he really wanted it.😂

WHY I ORDERED THE CYBER TRUCK?BECAUSE YOU CAN FLEX IT?

Who else thinks Elon should remake the Delorean?

I honestly think it&#39;s pretty cool, I just one problem with it...The bed cover covers your rear window. They literally have to use a camera for the rearview mirror, which is fine I guess. But what about when you want to look behind you when backing out instead of using a camera with a limited view, you just can&#39;t. Or you have to get out, roll your cover back, the get back in and back out, that design element just doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.

GUYS I SUBSCRIBED ALMOST 1000 NEW YOUTUBERS    GIVING THEM THE HOPE N SUPPORT  DURING THIS PANDERMIC  CALLED CORONA ,,,GUYS TO BE FRANK THE HAPPINESS I FELT BY DOING SO IS UNEXPLAINABLE  ..... U MIGHT THINK I AM GAINING SYMPATHY  OR SUBSCRIBERS  ,, BUT THATS NOT TRUE BECAUSE  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM PROBLEMS N WHEN THEY COMMENT TO GAIN SOME SUBSCRIBERS PEOPLE START SAYING BIKHARI 😔GUYS  IK ACTUALLY ITS NOT THE RIGHT  THING  TO COMMENT  N GAIN SUBSCRIBERS BUT THEY  ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT  , INSTEAD OF TELLING BHIKARI ATLEAST TELL THAT THEIR CONTENT IS GOOD , THOUGH IT IS TRUE OR FALSE BUT THEY GET THE HOPE TO IMPROVE N UPLOAD BETTER VIDEOS .....SO GUYS STAY UNITED  N SPREAD POSITIVITY

He said that he wasn&#39;t ordering it because it was matte black but his t-shirt reads matte black😂😂😂😂

Why the hell are u wearing spectacle??

The thing I really like is that at least I can draw it.

Ever heard of vantablack?

But does it scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7?

He ordered it because he can afford it.

Well at least they didn&#39;t make the tyre a hexagon instead of a CURVED circle

Really.... Dodge 3500 are beautiful, and the GMCs

You ordered,  because you have the 💰!!!

That meme made me actually LOL and spit-take all over my monitor! I DEF pre-ordered. It will replace my model S. Tired of door dings and want a tesla I don&#39;t have to &quot;baby&quot;.

The reason is because these people are addicted to buying things and chase the clout buying this shit gets them from other people addicted to buying things. Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s more trouble than its worth.

&quot; they are making a matte black version, and I swear thats not why im buying it&quot; <b>marques wearing a matte black shirt</b>

If a white guy wear &quot;pure white&quot; t-shirt is a racism, &quot;mate black&quot; I guess is harmless and ofc means something else...I&#39;m so happy I don&#39;t live in US!

My brother: draws cartonish carMe:this is horrible, do you think any one would release this type of carTesla: here it isMe:😲😲😲😲😲

I just want a model 3 dammit

When I never realized it’s a transformer

when they just copy the warthog from halo 1...

What is the total price?

Because you are loaded with cash... Why bother making videos to brag about it.

mATtE blAcK

It&#39;s the delorean all over again

The cybertruck looks like something from interstellar

You’re probably going to think I’m trolling you, but I wanted to ask you something. @kanglyd ig

Bezier is turning over in his grave

It looks like something you’d drive around Mars

I fucking love this mincraft looking thing (Unironically)

Man I need a real bat Mobil

One of the main reasons it barely has little to no curves is because of production costs. It&#39;d be more expensive if there were more spherical shapes and curves as it would take more time and better machinery which will cost money.

He ordered it cause he can... point blank and simple

Design crew: Our truck needs to stand out...Elon Musk: Yeah..........📦

Why am I watching a video on a metal box?

its a start for the gigantic start of the revolution in technology and this is the first step which basically i feels a very good start

I came from the future Now your desk setup cost more than the Cybertruck.

It&#39;s suitable for blacks.

Am I the only one who thinks that the Cybertruck looks pretty cool and looks pretty futuristic since every other car looks the same and boring af?

Could not agree more! Cybertruck reserved!

When did you get glasses
Ypu guys are amazing and paid sales man from youtube... actually you must thanks youtube available in every Phone

Hhhh Hope you won&#39;t change your mind when Rivian  comes out...Intresting vid dogh~

I DO NOT LIKE LIKE THE STUPID &quot;SQUARE&quot; STEERING WHEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

at <a href="">4:00</a>...   &quot;not a single curve anywhere&quot;............THAT instantly reminded me of the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk!!!

You ordered it?!?!?! Ok you are rich ok man ok I appreciate this

Man this is my birthday day when he sent this video lol

Ironic

Tesla is the apple of the car world lol

Hey! At least the tires have curves.

Imagine the amount of times we&#39;ll see the Cybertruck in action movies for the next 5 years

how may of u saw his tshirt after he said matte black

airpods design still sucks though... doesn&#39;t matter how much stubborn they are

HFGFJK

FM,

KIOIHUH

Inde Game
Because you have money a d you live in America.

The base model costs less than his computer 😂😂

Blackman stop talking
<a href="">6:16</a> Marques knows the future, he said &quot;Model Y&quot;

Why you ordered the cybertruck? b/c you rich rich!!

We need more people like elon to make this world more futuristic

this guys got unlimited money

Interesting without doubt !

Answering your question:You brought a Tesla Cybertruck because you are so rich. That&#39;s not a bad thing, but I will not watch your video since you don&#39;t really need a Tesla Cybertruck.

why I ordered a Tesla cybertruck?because i’m marketing Tesla

Who else watching this in 2020 think that Marques was trying a smart glass from some company?

Elon basically Steve jobssed the pickup truck just like the first iPhone reveal

a pickup Lamborghini lol
I have a Tesla model 3

Everyone should do the simple imaginary &#39;branding test&#39;. Imaging that you swap out the Tesla logo with a Nissan logo on the Cybertruck. Would you really still buy it? The same goes for the Tesla solar roof. I know that Elon sends out rockets, wants to go to unlivable Mars, builds flamethrowers and it all looks exciting, but that is all just branding that is selling the cars/trucks.

Yep, it damn sure does look like 5 year old Marques drew the design for it.

You should have subscribed to Scotty Kilmer Kama and he would have told you to buy a Toyota 4Runner. And also he would have told you that Tesla will be losing money in the next two years because they make junk. Facts

Can I use this to go to School

I&#39;m literally thinking how the hell this car is called as a truck.....🤔🤔🤔

Cause its cool

Great choice of words, bro just say truck consumers tend to be closed-minded

MKBHD: Orders a CybertruckAlso MKBHD after the video: &quot;Please buy my merch.&quot;

Because you don&#39;t have to tow anything.

Want teardown 😂

the title should be....What the hell did i just order lol

look at the name of his shirt tho

there are no curvesMinecraft coders: it’s free real estate

So you can say, &quot;Why I Ordered a Tesla CyberTruck&quot; on your YouTube channel, get over 7 million views, and then pay for it. lol....well Played sir.  You deserve it.

They&#39;ll do shit with a famous logo and sell well too..

they gave you a discount on advertising

this truck looks like designed by a 7 year old child...bro plz its  fkucking ugly

You definitely ordered it because you can have it in Matte Black

It almost makes me wonder if Elon and Frans had just scheduled an event and thought they could come up with a truck design by then, but just couldnt think of a good design for a truck, so a couple days out from the launch, they just threw together a bunch of scrap metal with some seats and a model 3 touch screen, made up some specs, and went on stage.

Went from hating it with a passion to loving the whole thing.. Matt black won&#39;t be a thing, Elon eventually tweeted &quot;you can wrap it in any colour you want&quot;

Dude. To much sponsored Tesla content. Stop it.

Sorry, can&#39;t pass the crash test.Car body has to crumple in order to absorb the impact. Those stiff panels are the way we built cars way back when we knew nothing about safety. They also can&#39;t make these panels with softer metal, since panels can&#39;t be that flat and angular if they are soft. Out of all Tesla&#39;s announcements, this is the most unrealistic one.

so do you expect to get a well finished product if Tesla would have to churn out this number of trucks when production starts?

Lol...i was waiting for the reason as to why he ordered it.😄

but can u play CSGO on it

Ugliest truck I&#39;ve ever seen

Ironically ur shirt says Matt black...

Can&#39;t wait for a triangle car.

Just waiting for him t9 say ive been driving it for rhe past two weeks here are my thoughts

I bought the merch

He got it so he can drive it to Best Buy and carry his Blu-rays on the bed

You know what, I think it&#39;s looks kinda dope... like 70s futurism (hence Cybertruck).It looked ugly at first, but I guess that&#39;s because I&#39;m not used to it. Seeing it zoom by at 60mph, LED lights blazing, electric motors motoring - that really did it for me.

Because he&#39;s a baller??

I really wish I could buy it but in the end it’s all because you have $. I don’t have extra $ but it indeed looks cheaper then a new car. 39K-60k for a decent model. I’d be too scared to waste my savings for this

“But thats not why im buying it”

Is it just me or does everyone think all techies always make sense

F250 is bought by men who want to look like men and not a fucking bitch from Marz! Full diesel turbo trust me I give no fucks about the envoronment

Well there goes a 13 year olds dream of making the change and making a flying car that looks normal.and after that if the kid is successful he would make a cool looking truck...someone beat the kid. (By the way I am talking about me)😭😭😭

I&#39;ve always thought it looks like a NASA rover vehicle. ... J

Because I have money

Bought tundra 5 years ago will keep it for 20 more years

If it doesn&#39;t come in Matte Black, dbrand has you covered.

<a href="">3:33</a> the Pixel 4 XL

He ordered it cause he got money

...it was the matte black option. Clearly.

Marquez: See it has no curvesNo One:Me: What about the wheels

It&#39;s very unattractive BUT it really looks the way I imagined the future would look...so, yeah.

Hey, this vdeo was like november 2019. Where is the review of the tesla?

Good video thanks.

you should order the black one, wear a batman mask. Pull up on people open your window to tell them you&#39;re batman.

Anyone who likes cars thinks this is ugly

You should have gotten a rezvani tank

Get right with God now! Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from death and you shall be saved! Pray everyday, read the Bible everyday, always give God the glory! Jesus is coming soon! If you are not a believer, please reconsider! If you confess your sins to God, He will forgive you! He is a gracious, merciful, and forgiving God! God bless you, I love you, have a blessed day and a blessed week!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

YOOOUGLEEE

I still think the cybertruck looks awesome

This is so ugly I can&#39;t even explain.....The DeLorean in the 80s was WAAAY more futuristic than this..... jesusmaybe all it needs is to include it in a blockbuster time traveller movie

Why we gave Elon Musk a free $1million loan

Cybertruck 2077

Why i ordered a Tesla Cybertruck : well because it&#39;s my god damn money

He ordered it because it’s a $100 refundable deposit for a car that won’t even be on the market for 2 years and to make a video he can monetize on YouTube 🤫

hi

This is the future of cars and you know it

Why? Because your loaded ofc. Lmao!

<a href="">2:56</a> lol

I think tesla are the Apple of electric cars honestly

Because he has the money.

the cyber truck is the best truck

He bought it for the meme

PR

marques: lets buy a lamborghini after that      there nothin here

He ordered a what????? 😯

I love the look plus so much seats for a pickup truck

I think it’s cool but it’s not as good looking as a f-150

CEO of that&#39;s not why I order it though

I personally think it’s kinda ugly looking.

BECAUSE WHY THE FUCK NOT

Spoilers: because he is rich and can afford it.

Answer: I wanna flex
He ordered it because..... his glasses prescription has changed and he can’t see how awful it looks<a href="">5:54</a> wow that thing looks awesome

The Solar Panel would br perfect for my case. I live in northern Brasil, where power is hard to get. We get power from a hydroelectric dam on our property. Like if you want me to make a vlog.

It looks like a futuristic car from the 80s.

It’s so ugly I can’t

The matte black is not why I bought it!Has a matte black everything shirt on

For attention
,

we all know it&#39;s because of the memes

The trunk looks cozy. I want to sleep in it.

He&#39;s a Tesla and matte black fanboy

<a href="">7:21</a> well that didn’t age well...

meme compilation

In 3 years i&#39;m getting one.

Bugatti: We have no straight lines on the car its all curve lines.Tesla: We have no curve line on it its all straight lines.-ELON MUSK THEORIES

stunt button lol

<a href="">0:44</a> that face lmao.... i don&#39;t know but look at his face when he was in the car

It’s good design.
elon mask should make an f1 team

If you say &quot; it&#39;s not why I&#39;m buying it&quot; fuck you

because im rich
i was going to buy it until that window broke

idk what that truck towards the end <a href="">5:53</a> you showed was, id guess somones idea of a better cybertruck, and sorry not sorry, but theyd be right. that fking truck looks insanely amazing. i love the way trucks look, but god damn that looks like the future. like if iRobot movie with will smith, if he drove a truck instead of that car, this is what itd look like

can you drive it on any street by law?

I want it

I like how he spent the same amount on the fucking pro computer

Pretty sure the Tacoma is the best selling truck, not the Ford F150. But you probably did more research than me.

&quot;Some parts of it are dope, and some parts are... weird&quot;. I think you meant &quot;nope&quot;?

Wearing a matte black shirt, while saying hes not ordering one bc of the matte black edition... lol

I think it&#39;s badass fr

Marques  we all know you want it for the matte finish 😆😆😆😭😭🤣

So many people that&#39;s salty cuz they can&#39;t afford a Tesla truck 😂 fuck sake

Elon Musk is living in the year 7162

I&#39;m gonna donate to a charity  6000 united States dollars If elon make more curvy version of the Cybertruck

When bumblebee was scanning cars to get transformed into a car it scanned cybertruck and chose to transform in a 80 years old car

You have ordered it cause you have more money then most people in this comment section 🙃.

List all the features And says ..that&#39;s not why I&#39;m buying it

Talk about matte black and matte red............nd its MKBHD🖤❤️🖤❤️

Buy luxury truck lose moneyUse truck to attract viewer.Investment.

Piece of crap

It could have stood out without being ugly as sin. Looks like it was designed by someone who has drafting squares for hands.

Go ahead son live it up! That&#39;s why I watch your videos. I love it. I&#39;m just loving it. I pray that you keep being bless in all you do. Keep living it up. I love it!

Looks like one of those polygon cars from really old videogames, like carmaggedon or something. cmon you ordered it just because you have money and because it looks futuristic, like a delorean.

Nobody:Marques: THATS NOT WHY I ORDERED IT THO

their is no curves in ittyres: Am i a joke to you

Because it will never make it on the street

Elon made it to the lowest resolution so the performance gets higher

The first time I saw the cyber truck I immediately fell in love with it. I do not like the ugly curves and bends that most cars have. The cyber truck though? It is a machine made from beautifully manufactured edges and lines. When people used to ask me what my favorite car is I would always say the Batmobile because there were no real cars that spoke to me. If someone were to ask me that question now though my answer would always be a fast and easy &#39;cyber truck.&#39;

It’s ugly

<a href="">4:42</a> this is true very intelligent way of marketing

Car guys: all cars today all look the same and are boring. Elon: <b>reveals cybertruck</b>Car guys: that is different, we hate it. Burn it.

I would really want to see one in real life but there illegal in Europe so yeh

Why ... I&#39;m rich that&#39;s why

The most ugly vehicle lol

He&#39;s a moronU Will definitely wait 4 years to get it

2010: nope2011: nope2012: still nope2013: not this time2014: nope2015: nah2016: nope2017: not this time2018: still no2019: wait for it2020: YUP LET&#39;S RECOMMEND THIS

The coolest thing about this cyber truck is that its interior design is so minimal yet it’s so futuristic

Kinda looks like the lines of a lambo

Make sure no one throws a rock at your window...

“Because I’m rich ya bitch!” That’s why

weird flex but ok

Shirt says “matte black everything” mmmhmm that’s not why you bought it ;)

Is it because of a meme

Because he can make 5 videos from it making $10-15k per video which effectively makes it free. What a legend!

Looks like something Robocop would ride in😂

He ordered because it&#39; literally his job

Why don’t buy the Kanye West Vehicle

That&#39;s one ugly looking car.

Well the best point about the cyber truck is it&#39;s uniqueness.. Like imagine seeing tht on the road next to a Lambo. I would honestly keep my eyes on this cuz I have seen lambos before

Its called a bakkie

The dude is a tech reviewer so obviously he would buy it so your viewers a** would have a look instead of buying it lol -To those that kept commenting &quot;he ordered it because he has money..&quot;

I&#39;m gonna have mine painted in diamond colour. You know, from MineCraft. This is just the perfect MineCraft truck!

I gave you a like <i>just</i> for doing this. I&#39;m now going to go ahead and actually watch your video. ^^

&#39;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m buying it for tho&#39; -mkbhd 2019

It looks so unreal feels , like seeing one of those cars I drew in 2nd standard

Becoz the escobar phone people are before you 😂

First he makes a truck that got as much curves as raw spaghetti, Then he names his son what could be a name for one of Sony’s headphones.Wow, Elon Musk is one heck of a guy.

but is an extremely ugly car! is really ugly!!!! LOL

My first ever truck is going to be a Tesla Cybertruck!

Cybertruck looks like a real life roblox car

I love you.

The only reason I want this is to keep myself safe on the road. I think it looks a bit tacky but yknow who cares

It is a minecraft truck lol

I would of just got a doge ram 1500

I still think its ugly haha

Would love to see cyber truck going off road.

It’s nice, but the rear end is SUPER UGLY

Someone roughly knows the pricing for the cybertruck?

I quite like it
Comeon man tell us the real reason&quot;it&#39;s a transformer isn&#39;t it&quot;

I want wheel without curve. Just angle no curve. Lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣

it’s so ugly ulgh

Why would anyone need a box car from the Stone Age

&quot;We gotta think outside of the box&quot;<b>Literally designs a box</b>

To flex..

Like who the f*** cared if you ordered it 😂

nobody:Marques: &quot;thats not why im buying it though&quot;

of course your buying it because it has a matte black version, your not fooling anyone marques

He ordered it because he&#39;s a millionaire!

Don&#39;t waste your time by watching this video for 7-8 minutes.... The reason why he is buying it is.... Cus he has money... 😂

He ordered it because he is Rich. There you go

Mkbhd more like MusKBHD
What the hell kinda “truck” is that lol

Matte black would be the single reason I would get one

I thought unbox therapy was dumb.

Little did he know there was a virus you have to defeat before you can get your CyberTruck reward.

It fuckin cost ⁵⁶k
Marques: I swear I’m not buying it because it’s matte black.Also Marques: <b>Wearing matte black T-Shirt</b>

Now collect the other 4 to make the ultimate transformer

Can you subscribe to my channel Marques

Elon Musk: Design a Tesla Pickup truckDesigner playing original Halo: I have an idea

Soft edge with shock absorbing material at dashboard will give some assurance to driver

I ordered one also - love Tesla

I swear Elon was bored in his office which is how this was created😂😂

Yeah Apple did something that is memorable and it growed on me, but the Cybertruck is too much. And doesn&#39;t matter, I cannot afford it anyways😂

i love how he says he didn&#39;t get it because its matte black

They should collabe with cyberpunk

Hey guys, so I&#39;ve had this for a couple of weeks now

Then why are you wearing a t shirt which says matte black?🤨

Real talk, will you get the cyberquad tho

This guy definitely has money.😂

:why i am not order a tesla cybertruck:no money

I feel like MKHB has Tesla stocks

I change this comment for no reason

The truck looks like something a child drew. It looks stupid. I absolutely want one.

MKBD: the cyber truck can drive.But that’s not why I bought it.

<a href="">3:55</a> look at the wheels

RoboCop and Knight Rider vibes

&quot;hopefully it comes out on time&quot;RONA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

But it&#39;s shape isn&#39;t good.

What the F Happens if you Crash it? If you Crash into another car with THAT The person in that other car Could Be Killed Or Very Seriously Injured

This video alone paid for his cybertruck.

Make no sense to me. If you rich its just a reason to spent money

Its not why I ordered it moments<a href="">1:43</a><a href="">2:16</a><a href="">2:55</a>

The marble can’t be a real thing. Just imagine getting into a crash and cracking your head open on that if the airbags didn’t work

I&#39;ve been driving a cyber truck for 2 weeks now, and here are my thoughts...

What kind of mic is he using?? I could hear his lips smacking 😂😂

Marquez: The truck can fly, open up wormholes and has a virtually unlimited storage capacity...<b>But, It&#39;s not why I am buying it for...</b>

Matte black not why I am ordering it                                       Shirt said matte black every day

Great video... I ordered one too. No more gas is a great thing. I love my wife&#39;s model s, it&#39;s the coolest car I&#39;ve ever driven.  The Cybertruck actually cost the same as my F150 so people hating are really quite stupid.  Why not get a bulletproof Matte black super fast truck that never needs gas or oil changes... Stop hating

This video changed my opinion of the Cybertruck.  Thanks for making it!

after this video I want to go buy a ford f1 50

Classic <a href="">0:10</a>

Exactly zero actual truck users will order this. All hipsters and techies

I never thought it was ugly I thought it looked super cool I love the truck most favorite car from Tesla my second favorite is the X

I just ordered it today

It is kind of like Homers car.

<a href="">4:20</a> You know it&#39;s real when Morpheus hops out the back seat..

Dude you are good in what you do but am not sure this cyber truck of a thing is for me YET!

because you have extra money alternately you will review it for youtube income?

the only reason i dont have it: it&#39;s a lie.

You no buy CyberTruck?... You Gay
The Tesla cyber truck does not look like a child tried to draw a car, it looks like a child tried to draw a Lamborghini

I totally agree. This is a disruptive technology by far, and for many years to come will remain so. Elon is on track to control the world&#39;s transportation, with automobile and trucks, spaceX, and just maybe trains and bikes in the near future. Watch out! It&#39;s a grand plan, and all the dots will connect one day.

when a solitary video has over 7 million views, why not buy a meme car ?

The most ugly part of this otherwise polished design, is those terrible rims... what were they thinking

i will pay 10k for the lowest reservation number possible instagram @marcolattimoose

0%=Nudity0%=music10%=that wired combination of shapes9999%=&quot;it&#39;s not the reason I ordered this&quot;

Chhutiya

&#39;No Pickup Truck is beautiful&#39;  Have you seen Truckla?

Minecraft: exists Elon musk: *turns it into real life *

Are we not gonna talk about his shirt

The house Is a house that’s not y im buying it though

It looks like a batman ride

But why does it look like a metallic door stop?

Wow this is the most interesting video about a person talking about the cybertruck, but I like tesla because it is all electric in general but the 1 top real reason is that I like the exterier of all tesla vehicles period.

Looks like a ps1 graphics car

It will be nice to see a crash test

Am I the only one who thinks it looks a bit like the Warthog from Halo?

Tesla Cybertruck: <b>exists</b>Marques: That&#39;s not why I bought it...

I just can&#39;t whait for this video here, where&#39;s the truck man???

The car was the best car ever, but that&#39;s not I ordered it though

&quot;Cybertruck is amazing in every way and definitely the best, BUT THAT&#39;S NOT WHY I ORDERED IT THOUGH&quot;.

I won&#39;t watch this anymore,these guys shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have that amount of money. NOT for what they do.

Pickups aren&#39;t pretty? Wtf!!! Ford Raptor? Is amazing!!!!

And this is why Tesla made it.

Den me noiazei
I’m sorry but it’s ugly

The truck looks sicko!

I never thought real life graphics would look worse than gta 3 cars lol, I’m still fascinated with the truck tho. 😁

lmao it dont even look bad

Because you like to horde expensive stuff

Rainproof. Duh.
Wears shirt that reads MATTE BLACK on it and says that hes not ordering a cybertruck just because it comes in matte black

That&#39;s not why you ordered it 😂

Because u can afford it... DUH!

He probably bought it from the money he got from making all the tesla videos.  This video probably made him 60-65k usd.    And the other video with 5.5 mill views maybe got him 35-40k.   Basing his cpm at 8 usd.  So yeah marques. Nice strategy. You already have the money to buy it three years later

because you&#39;re an idiot trend follower and you&#39;ll probably make more money than you lose by buying it.

cuz u filthy rich
How much money do people actually make on YouTube? 🤔

That&#39;s like a car before Calculus was invented

i returned my cybertruck when elon started protesting lockdown

the design looks like my 5 year old drawing, If i can find it back and shove it up the face of the people who said my car drawing sucks.

The straight lines were also to save costs. Because it’s 30x steel rather than aluminum,  it’s much harder to bend, so they used straight lines instead of bending the metal

the truck looks like origami

Yea, the angles does make it look very discordant. I guess their goal with the design is to stand out.

Wait until you try and park it at the grocery store, lol. Why would they do this to their brand? I&#39;m still hoping this is a bad joke by Tesla and they&#39;ll make it more like their other vehicles. I have never looked at a Tesla and thought it was ugly, until this truck. I think Rivian is going to crush this truck in sales. And if their partnership with Ford works out, the F-150 will continue to be the leader.

I fell in love with Cyber Truck from the first time I saw it.

We get it, he’s bin on your channel. 💰

Give it to me

Design team: everyone think outside the boxElon musk: let’s make a box 📦

Tesla just merged with Lego.

Dude you a lame ass nerd goddamn 😆😆😆😆😆
Because you’re a Tesla sheep.
JUST TELL ME. WHY ARE YOU ORDERING ONE.

Tesla and Apple should collaborate

At 0.48 , just above the left front tire, you can see straight thru to the other side...this is a mock-up, a fake thing...just like all the crap Tesla trots out for the faithful...keep on drinking the Kool-aid fanboys, maybe your dream-ride will materialize...someday.

What a fuckin shit ball name ur voice

Dude, your wealth is sad. You should donate to charity.

marques: (tells all cool stuffs about cyber truck) noone: ......marques again : THATS NOT WHY I ORDERD IT THO ....

next video: why i sold my tesla CyberTruck so low!

Cuz you&#39;re rich?
So how much weed did the designers take

Quick plug to not support abusive capitalists like Elon Musk and help poor people instead . But yknow, u do u

Looks like bat mobile but white

I love That People ask him if he pre-ordered it like it is some kind of video game.

Cause you got money.And you have to be crazy.

The cybertruck cost him so much he had to work so hard he got spectacles🤣🤣

Why do they need two years until release

I wouldnt buy it even i was rich

Wow. That must be very humiliating for Elon .

how the fuck is this safe for pedestrians lmao

TO GET FAME ???!!!
Bro how much you get from YouTube

He ordered it because in the future this will be the vehicle we use when we live on Mars. I don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m saying.

Where&#39;s side view mirrors?

Potentially unpopular opinion but that truck looks absolutely hideous

<a href="">1:20</a>&quot;you can stand on it&quot;isn&#39;t that to be expected from a trucl?

Why do i make this video ?“So i can have my money back through youtube’s monetisation”

noo, u already have it aren&#39;t u?

Because he&#39;s rich..which also explains all the expensive overkill video gear 🤣

Elon Musk’s advisors updated from the square wheels...

I drew this truck design on my Pee-Chee folder in 1971.

Tirle- Why I ordered the Tesla Cyber truck.SIMPLE ANSWER- COZ UR RICH

Where does BC get so much money from?
Which version did you get?
My question is , what is the rationale behind the cyber truck ? What is the idea?

I usually like your reviews, but this video is straight pointless. I’m guessing you’ve made this just to earn more money

Bruh, this guy already sold his soul to bill gates. Who is in Bed with Elon. 5g Voltron assemble!!

Complete waste of time watching this

Beacuse your not starving🤣🤣
Answer:  it&#39;s the cheapest way to appear woke on YouTube and social media.  That&#39;s why

It reminds me of an F35
