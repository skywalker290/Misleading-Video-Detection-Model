When a generation does not know about REWARD and BRIBE

NO  PLAANS  IS  THE  ONLY  PLAN

That&#39;s business.😂

&quot;Aap Mujhe rishwat de rahe hai lol&quot; love that line

Ranveer&#39;s laugh 😂🤣

Ranveer&#39;s reaction is hilarious

Family blackmailing the son...such a usual thing in India 😂

kya kaha isne........bang on man bang on!lmfao
Ranveer&#39;s acting was on point.👍🏻

i just love with saifali acting

aajka educated culture yhi jo bht hi baswaas hai or pehle ke loog normal the but jindagi sukoon or khusi or ek doosre ka izzat kartethe ,,or baap ke saamne bolna too door khade hone mai bhi soochtaa tha aulaad daar se

Its a serious mattahh😂

I don't care about you.
Da way AK says &quot;Plane chahiye ki nehi&quot;... is epic...and Ranveer ,phenomenal

Where can I find the full movie??
Ranveer look handsome in normal clothes

I just love Ranveer acting!!
Indian family reality ...❤️❤️
Fantastic🤘😝🤘 movie🎥 full fun, reality of showing rich people prblms also

I liked ranveers acting in this movie.

I always wanted to feel that how it feels to be a kid of a rich family where your parents use you for enhancing business !! 😂

This movie is a Classic!🥰

stupid junky movie
&quot;We don't want a bike, we don't want a bike&quot;
Can&#39;t Stand This Type Of Selfish Parents Who Treat Their Children Like A Puppet For Their Own Gains...

Anil Kapoor&#39;s reactions are killing 😂😂😂😂🤣

😀😀😀😀

Noori should also get a doctor at the same time!
Sometimes wat best for u is listen to ur parents...!

<a href="">3:33</a> her expression 😂

You also said the same thing about humans and me🤣
Only movie where we saw real Ranveer face

Perfect 👌
All the scenes of this movie❤️❤️❤️❤️The acting, cast, emotions everything is fab❤️

E

I actually liked the movie. Makes sense, if you leave the luxury aside. Just scale down the luxury to your size and think . This is what happens. Shit happens

Mere parents bhi meri shadi aisi ladki se kar rahe the jo mujhe bilkul pasand nahi thi kyu ki Dahej achha mil raha tha...Aur ladkiyo ko bhi lagta h paise de kar koi bhi ladka khareed legem

Anil Kapoor&#39;s acted the best of his career in this movie

Strange and non moral story...... useless film...I think

This really happens in big business world wife gf and wedding ko business samjhte ho really 🤣

The way Anil said “Plan chahiye nhi kya tumhe” ज़्नु भाई always rocks.
BC.....even Mukesh Ambani would not have told his children that they should not have a plane.
Brother, this is not a line plane, let me tell you the story of a mother and father, how they made their children work by bribing.
I hope everyone eats their guts.
<a href="">3:11</a>

This brother sister jodi rocks

I cant blv these two played husband n wife in Bajirao mastani 😂.. such good actors

Idk,but I am laughing with ranveer Singh!

Kitni fake smile thi isme ranbeer ki

Ye toh meri family jaisi Nikli ameer family bhi aisi hoti hai?

I m sorry but i do tht laugh and father reacts like tht only😂😂

Best acting RS

Need English subs
So funny

NOORI KO BHI SAATH MEIN LEKE GHOOMO😂

Damn this movie was way ahead of time

They are saying plane chahiye as if they are buying some fruits

waiting Kgf chapter 2 😎
Had this movie been scripted around a chawl or a middle-class area like Sion (in Mumbai) it would still have flopped cos this movie shows the age-old patriarchy and typical yet empty family values and THAT IS THE TRUTH, and no one likes telling/hearing as it truly is. One of the most under-rated movies of the modern Bollywood

Really sad to see Indian society is still stuck t minus 50 years

Who are these logs? Where do these logs come from?
Why this mov not available in you tube

The chemistry between Ranveer and PC in this movie is 🔥

This movie is for all those bloody blood sucker

I don&#39;t understand how is divorce such a huge deal in higher sections of society. They infact don&#39;t care much for making marriages work unnecessarily.

This movie is soo good

I can watch dis movie over n over again.such a lovely movie.n d acting done by all d actors is just awesome

Wooooo

<a href="">3:32</a> is every indian family when a person younger than them speaks the truth

Anil Kapoor’s slanted looks towards Ranvir at the beginning were awesome. Great movie - need not one but a few sequels

Ranveer look so cute😍😍🤗☺️
Priyanka ki ek entry or game change krke chali gyi

It seems a good movie. Thinking to download it and watch it.

This is so realistic,how anil loses patience eventually and ranveer asks if they’re trying to bribe him,and shefali says in that super realistic voice “Kabir don’t be silly” god it’s amazing

Haha..plane chaiye ki nahi hai..oh god
