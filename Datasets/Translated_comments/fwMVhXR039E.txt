Get lost
<a href="">13:51</a>

Iam surprised to know who was she who broke his awards which is so mean if it is katrina God bless to vicky as they are true artists not just there in industry for glamor image....

His  interviews are addictive..!!!

@Ranbir KAPOOR, hi Sir, Limitation's har ek body kho hota hei, shayadh woh kheedhe makhdhe ho, yaa Vriksh ho, Janthuuue(animals) ho, yaa manushyy ho?
He ie so good. Superb Guy !
His thinking gives me vibe of Rahul Gandhi never a star material but being to forced to be one

He Using a wig on his headReal hair can see separately 

Happiness family toosirji

Hugely Intelligent person. Respects all his relationships &amp; everyone. Whatever he says feels genuine. ️️

RANBIR is the hottest 

Ranbir you are all time greatest in whole world

Okay, i&#39;m a girl and i noticed that RK has the hottest shoulder

Ranbir U r Rockstar in Bollywood

Sbse best hero hai ye

<a href="">20:51</a> to <a href="">22:18</a> BEST PART  I LIKE HIS SAVAGE
OMG ending part 
he’s still in sanju character 

I have always thought &quot; pain &quot; is an asset for Ranbir when he acts . He knows perfectly how to express pain which makes me wonder if he has had a heartbreak/or saddening incident because this kind of pain cannot be expressed without being familiar with it personally . I think it started from &quot; Rocket Singh &quot; for me before that I only considered him as decent actor &amp; eye pleasing .

Ranbir kapoor is 

He’s undoubtedly one of the versatile actors of all time. His talent is individual and unmatched.

Ranbir is most masterious man in Bollywood I love him so much 

Aila ️
I love this man so much ️

My hero
I love this man ️

So he had a pathetic girlfriend who used to break his AWARDS!!!!! and people abuse him saying bla bla bla just bcz he never opened up about his side and never defamed any of his exes publicly... I don’t think i need any other clue to know who is that gf....Obviously who doesn’t know the value of AWARDS!!

Sanju biopic was a propoganda film.By the way he is brilliant actor

Love you so much Ranbir ️
Are you ashamed of speaking your Hindi language?
Rocketsingh was a very nice movie.....

His playlist shows he was in love, he was not wrong every time

13.52 :J: so whats the weirdest rumourRanbir: Aa gaya na apni aukaad pe? xD

Overrated expressionless actor! Just surviving off good PR. The only recommendable films he&#39;s done so far are Wake Up Sid and Rocket Singh, that&#39;s it. He should do more films like these.

Cold little heart is really legendary song️️️

After sharukh he is superb actor in Bollywood I really admire him whatever he does in private life

I hate this host lady 

Aagya naa apni aukat parr 
The one who called RK an overrated actor also has fans of overrated DP RS and Kat 
He is the best 
&quot;Aa gaya na apni aukat pe!&quot;
This is the day when he informed jitesh about Alia&#39;s childhood stories about &quot;aap ki baras&quot; and the &quot;frog story&quot;

Rk ma fvrt actor
Ranbir is a very good actor.xx. xx

Mst probably d future of bollywood

<a href="">13:52</a> lmaoo Ranbir knows his aukat too

Friend, which boy is not a playboy.. Every boy is.. But Ranbir Kapoor is not smart enough to suck, that's why he is seen and is the chip of others. I love Ranbir Kapoor
<a href="">10:09</a> Good job.
@<a href="">21:31</a> no one else could have given an answer this way .He is the best

Ranbir

They didn&#39;t made anything good since 2010

If Robert De Niro and Ryan Gossling had a love child it would look like Ranbir Kapoor‍️

He loves imagine dragons like me
Ranbiiir, I, exist :) 
My eyes became like this when I be watching him 

You know when u love an actor so bad but it breaks ur heart that he doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re even exists. I&#39;m 20 and I love him since 15, I literally love everything about him and I rarely being obsessed with a celebrity, love from Egypt ️

Ranbir bhai u r the true gentlemen and u r the real rockstar and u r my inspirstion

He&#39;s good looking and funny. Deadly combination.

Only few actors have dis much analysation about what they do...he is frst among them

I like this man is not coz of his acting, but coz of his positivity, they bother him, we all have weakness side as a human so, guys let him enjoy his lifr

HE IS BAAAKKWWAAAAAASSSSS

I once hated Ranbir for cheating deepika But he got paid for what he did to her So media should stop asking about his personal have you done anything wrongHe is one of the finest actors

<a href="">8:54</a>- <a href="">9:16</a>   seedhi baat no bakwas. No matter what happens, the show must go on. He is very honest to his profession

When I look at him I&#39;m kind of see myself on him many people compliment me I am bit of look like him sometimes if I see myself in mirror  I always related to his looks anyway I like his all movies even it&#39;s not hits he is finest actor in Bollywood more power to you man 

rajkumar rao much better than overrated kapor.rao is an international award winner and has a national award too.

All time grt actor .

Left ear piercing he&#39;s a Gay. 

RK
Alia and ranbir will break up soon........

Forever Favorite️
As an a actor he is my favorite actor but as a person he is absolutely not my ideal !

R. Kapoor is class! this little interviewer is like the satan on South park series. Can&#39;t tell if its a man or whining woman.. heehhee :)

Ranbir most most talented actor

Filmfare:Sawariya-Best debutRoket Singh Salesman-CriticsRockstar-Best ActorBarfi-Best actor,CriticsSanju-Best Actor
Isn&#39;t the interviewer so irritating?

<a href="">19:07</a> &quot; Arrey, that Filmfare hai usko haat matt laga&quot;
Best actor and honest person in Bollywood industry

Filmfare is clearing their draft these all videos must have posted way long back

To everyone who think that he is playboy  may be you all have your veiw but you are none to judge any one  plz stop saying that ...And  its not his  mistake or  may be it doesn&#39;t work with girls  he was in relationship  its the thing that happen ti everyone ...if you know he is not serious about relationship than why you being in relationship with him--?? He is a man who never ever want to hurt any women

personality wise I admire ranveer, but acting wise!!! COMMON! Ranbir is No 1 in the industry nowadays

Aagya na apni aukaat pe 
Best actor of this generation period.After himShahid and Ranveer  equally good. Don’t dare to say they are in his league no offense if ur their fanboys.

Acting in rk bloodHe born actor

Ranbir is the best <a href="">#ranbirian</a>

We always love RK forever

he is very talented brainy kind and charming.

<a href="">5:34</a> ranbir I assure you you are the best

Mans snorted lines
Really like listening to RK. He comes across as one of the most mature actors in our industry. It seems he doesn’t believe in putting on facades and really like the fact that he is quite relatable when he gives away his flaws in the interviews very unreluctantly.He is such a fine actor. He just needs to choose better scripts these days and not get into typical Bollywood commercial cinema.

R. K is grt and awesome actor. Keep going

Some chutiya is coming to say about his breakups and he will leave aaliya So in advance fuck you and please show the list of Bfs of girls you talking about

Ranbir is a better actor than ranveer

Most Overrated actor of his time. mind you I didn&#39;t say he isn&#39;t a great actor, I said he&#39;s over-rated.

uff  tauesnd time MASHA ALLAH  banda chamak raha hai love him without ends....

Ranbir ur amazing

Rk sir now I can say I don&#39;t deserve myself as your fan... I took wrong information about you ... even haters of you much more mature and sensible than me ... Sorry Rk sir ...

He is intelligent for sure...

tamasha and rocket singh are under rated movies of ranbir.....he is supremely talented  and good looking...real rockstar

poor quality

hate this hornball

Finally..most awaited video for me..love you Rk
Since last few days I have been watching old interviews on repeat 
Finest actor and stud person

Ye anchor chakka hai sala hai
Why it&#39;s not in HD format

Nice , Please subscribe and support my channel for DIY and makeup  : @UC4fzVJ-IrED4tJ32W5kPRWA​

Baba why you are not coming in social Media

SO CHARMING!!!!! SO NATURAL...

There was no one, there will be no one like Ranbir ️ Kapoor, ever!

M big RK fan... Forever
A complete package - amazing actor, awesome looks, great dancer and on top of it extremely humble.... love you Ranbir, you are one of the best things happened to Bollywood 

I just came here to abuse the interviewer..chudu
This interview is so freaking old...and filmfare is uploading it now....what the heck...the content is no more interesting for me...sorry i cant continue watching this...great turn off for me.

This host has ladki wala love for Ranbir

Playboy

Its 2019 and there&#39;s no 720p or 1080p hahaha

rockstar favourite
RK haters ..get a life
Most humble most handsome and  best actor in the Bollywood. Every body love him. ️️️‍️🇹🇯
I think video was shooted way to before!

Whatever his contemporaries achieve, this guy is the best of his generation ️

Ranbir is so natural and understanding person

13.53  yeah that&#39;s their aokat 

Ranbir did besharam cause he wanted to mass hero like salman ,he wants same dabang the super stardom that not happened  ....I think he should follow the path of Amir khan not so massy not so artistic movie ...mixing of both good for him

Saab is the father in acting...with right scripts we always give blockbusters, this is the potential..but this art should be limited to films..
Man SOMEONE CHANGE THIS HOST. He is so annoying and almost like an aunty taunting his guests. I saw many interviews he has the same aunty tone and it is irritating. I felt so bad when Ranbir spoke about the shooting of Kun faya as magical and he went on to say is it bakwaas or really happened. Do chaapad maaro saale ko. This host needs to change and i am unsubscribing.

Personal life is a reflective of the acting skills of an actor,he seems to be in a turmoil of emotions ,which can also be captivating for the audience but also a saddening experience at the same time...

Ranbir&#39;s interview after long time..so excited ..rabbit u r made for actor cos u r very talented ,good looking ,loving..u r not made for behind the scenes..I m sure u will be a good director but right now we want to see u more and more

I want to slap this annoying host

Host is really annoying

Jitesh comes across as a very shallow person

&quot;Sanju is not a propaganda film&quot; lol 
Great ranbir

Look...... cheap play boy is here..... hate him.... and from where he looks handsome...... if this is defination of smartness.... so people are# lol...

<a href="">#Kingkapoor</a> in the house..

Ranbir love u..
Why in India don't they speak in their native language, why don't they like their language in English?
He&#39;s so bloody overrated.. there are so many more better than this nepotistic shit.

This is clearly an old interview as his getup is of Sanju and also he mentioned abt the rumour of his engagement to a delhi girl which happened 1-2 yrs bk.

why is quilaty so low

We want one with Deepika padukone

See you at movies. He is not in social media. He didn&#39;t do PR works. Still his fan base is cult. Thalaivaaaaa

I am great  Rk fan from chennai. Thanks for this video. Most of RK fans including me didn&#39;t have any update on his flim. This year he has no release. We thought we miss this man interviews. Finally i got this one. I always see his interviews. His interview are so good and you learn so much things.

Love you RK...

Hey but that&#39;s really unfair!! Why read only mean comments ? The sweet ones would surely outweigh those

Please Ranbir I beg of you to change your hairstyle. Please. Makes you look so old which you are not ! And love you ️

This guy is amazing....

ok

My favorite <a href="">#RK</a>

Love u RK
10.13 he said what he want to call her

Product of nepotism

Ranbir is the coolest man alive

Rk 
All time best performance

My all time favorite only ranbeer kapoor.

Ranbir Kapoor is the best actor not only in Bollywood but in the world.
Most boring interview ever

Things nd perceptions abt d BEST ACTOR OF DZ GEN were soooo difrnt.. I just found dat out... Last 2 years of khilji, Gully boy, bajirao changed so many things 4 ranveer... Earned hm d fair position f best along wt ranbir

b4 jagga jasoos
his looks still gives that he has still not let Sanju out of his mind .. 

Samajhne waale samjh jaayenge why he keeps asking himself if he&#39;s happy

He is the man who is always glorified after dumping a lot girls and still getiing a girl , a young and well settled girl ..

I was literally waiting for ranbir to arrive ️️️️
Rk️
Is he talk about alia bath ??From Afghanistan 

Who the hell can pick alia over Kat.. I mean Kat is the kind of girl any guy would love to have she z mature, beautiful,sexy n have great sense of humour, humbleness n also good heart .. rk lost a diamond  she loved her truly irrespective of being foreigner she would have been a gr8 daughter in law for Kapoor&#39;s which neetu ji didn&#39;t realize.... Don&#39;t know what she saw in alia except famous surname n huge career..

He&#39;s just getting better with age, I was 12 when he debuted in 2007, n now I&#39;m 24 n he still look same 

Is this an old interview? He has the look of Sanju, and he&#39;s talking about jagga jasoos...

Lots of Love my RK! You are awesome

No matter how kind he shows himself. I cant stand this Man. He is so low value. He really disgust me.

“Am I happy?” — not a surprise he is asking this question cz he sure doesn’t look happy since dating Alia.

Such a looser

Ranbir giggle at <a href="">20:29</a> saying a lot <a href="">#Radha</a> <a href="">#soty</a>  keep smiling brow 

HE IS THE BIGGEST LIAR PERSON HOPE ....GOD BLESS U .....WHO KNOW U PERSONALLY THEY HAVEN&#39;T A WORD TO DESCRIBE U .....SUCH A ..........MAN
A complete actor

aa gaya na apni aukat mein घोज़ा<a href="">14:00</a>
The most handsome versatile finest cutest desirable unique actor, humble kind loving polite and down to earth person, gem and future of Bollywood <a href="">#MrRanbirkapoor</a>..Lots of love and respect man. 

OMG ! Take a deep breath listening and watching him always raises my heartbeat...

best actor ever 
Once upon a time ...U were adored...But now  u  have become the  definition of despise...

Loved it

We luv u RK
<a href="">13:53</a> hahah good job ranbir!! Best reply to this annoying host

Ranbir ️
Great admirer of his work  I have been detected..lol and may be we knew the names of almost all detectives 

Saroj Khan taking the interview of Ranbir kapoor.Tell me, if you felt the same about it.But this Saroj Khan asks the best questions so far  among all the indian interviewers.

Hit like if you are thinking kitna Purana Interview hai Bhai 

Suddenly why dislike Alia so much just because Ranbir Kapoor is in Alia’s life.Alia is one of finest actress, cutest actress and is very good by nature.Ranbir and Alia know each other from many years.Above all Ralia have met each other 15 years back for Balika Vadhu photoshoot . I am happy for Ralia.TOUCHWOOD

He is shit from his mind never went serious hate him

<a href="">

Ranbir Kapoor is the most talented actor and he has an awesome personality ️️️.

Katrina Ranbeer 
Love u ranbir kapoor

If each break up is cheating then everyone has to grow <a href="">emotionally.in</a> relationships there is always break up , cheating, heart break . Very unfortunate that only RK  has Casanova/ playboy tag .past is past.Ranbir Kapoor start own movie production, in collaboration .hope future holds good for Ranbir Kapoor’s movies and marriage.

Jitna Shahrukh has not done romance in the movie, as much as this band is doing real life romance....
Love from BD🇧🇩

I am not his fan...but I don&#39;t think he is that bad as a person...it&#39;s like there&#39;s this campaign against him in social media...calling him drugbir,gay,ugly and chreater...It&#39;s not like he is hated by  the public or even the industry...but so many out there envy him for his easy privileged life...his exs and competitors PR won&#39;t spare him too...and add to that kangana who he refused her advances,and she openly stalking him and alia...all this people have so much time in hand to abuse him...

I can tell he doesn&#39;t like this interview  guy lol

Biggest third class flirt.. Hate him so much.. What acting.. Acting also bakwaas

<a href="">20:07</a> damn,  lost on you is my favourite song too, Shit! 

Rk️
The best rk

You&#39;re the best, RK!

I sometimes feel Ranbir...he&#39;s never spoken his side of the story ever and the media has always somehow thrown a negative light upon him for being the commitment phobic/ the heart breaker. His introverted nature makes things worse..I wish he opened up more. Although he is somewhere for sure, undoubtedly, un-mistakenly into hook ups!!Also need to add this: The way his interviewers are never convinced by his answers speak a lot! Guys like Ranbir are really difficult to read. Here I am trying hard to assess his character! Goodness! God bless Katrina, Deepika..not Alia!

Why is the video quality so bad ?

He is most versatile actor in our generations.

Ranbir is like a forgotton actor all people are remembering are his relationship.thats like  a downfall of an actor.i dont know all this new actors coming out wih great films ,what is he doing no films to remember

The host gets on my nerves everytime he utters a word

I am fan of ranbiir and depika Who with me 

Ranbir is best..

I don&#39;t like him because he don&#39;t care anyone emotions

Wroten ? Realy? It&#39;s Written /wrote
Lovely

don&#39;t like him anymore for being playboy

I like him because of his pure personality

Katrina changed him
Aagaya na apni aukaat pe
He is overrated.

Love RK...underrated actor. Hope his next movies are a success

He is the nicest person in this planet.

Most honest person of bollywood 

Best actor!
Ranbir plz don&#39;t  marry alia...she is no match for u...u r so simple..wellmannered...talented..whereas she is loud...show off type...she pretends all the time...

He better leave alia..he deserves better ..And she doesn&#39;t deserve so good..

Rk is the most complete actor India has ever had!. He is good looking, he is charming, he has got something magical in him!. Love you RK. Best Wishes.

Ranbir ur the finest actor but you deserve someone better than alia

My favourite ranbir kapoor

Rk ,You are my favorite among allkeep going

Oh my God..... Where were you RK 

Listening to him after a very long time!! Wowww!!

Rk is best️️️️️️️️️
Alia is right for him

Hi team, I was waiting for this so long... One of the finest actor.. my all time favourite. RANBIR KAPOOR we all love you man...

Rk is one of the finest and versatile actor in the industry...  Exicted to watch him always...love u RK...

Ranbir: Aagiya na apni aukaat me......hhahahaahhaha
I dont understand why people only blame ranbir for his breakups. How many girlfriends he had publicly? Deepika, katrina, alia right? The man is literally 36 yar. My mom is 36 and she has two children. 5 or 6 relationships at the age of 36 is common. Is it really necessary to drag him everytime he gives an interview?

He the finest and most good looking actor of today’s generation. More power

Goog actor
Forget his private life and relationship bt he is one the most finest actor we have in bollywood...

Love him  as an actor not as a human being

A talented actor n a exuberant heartbreaker flirt lol
Rk 
He&#39;s really matured  you go Rk

Love
Rk  

My favorite actor :-<a href="">#ranbir</a>_kapoor

Huge fan of him from Afghanistan, he is the best ever!...

Love️
