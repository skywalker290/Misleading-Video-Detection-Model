Where can I buy?
Thank you very much for the destroyed elevators
Lol. The famous Pukin falcons. Were they supposedly trying to cause hunger, or what?
Long live the Russian Aerospace Forces, the most humane Aerospace Forces in the world!!!
Unfortunately, mistakes do happen. Autumn and very unpleasant.
This is definitely bad. But this is a complaint against those who indicated the goals.
DBL BLD (s)
now the barmaley will have nothing to eat))
bombed the elevator - called it an oil storage facility
The elevator was destroyed. Well done. If you strongly doubt that this is an elevator, search Google for a photo of the oil depot closest to you and the nearest elevator (post-Soviet construction).

the granary is also a strategic object - now terrorists without buns and bread will die of hunger
THIS is how to deal with terrorism.  Accurate strikes, no negotiations, no bribes.  Bravo, Putin.

Destroying oil storage facilities means raising the price of oil and undermining the economy of the terrorists. The most effective method of fighting terrorists is SIMPLY DEPRIVING THE MATERIAL BASE.
Or maybe ISIS cars run on flour?
fuck THIS IS AN ELEVATOR
In general, this is an elevator, send it to the bearded men in heaven. ))
There is a typo in the name in the word “oil storage facility”; it would be more correct to say “granary storage facility”.
Below me there is silence. A sky full of millet.
Fuck this is a grain storage facility, that’s the whole essence of Russian media information! sadness!
What a joke, these are wheat storage silos. The RuSSians like to bull$hit about how they are fighting ISIS. They mostly hit civilians and useless objects.

<a href="">0:16</a> Is it just my imagination or did this body fall to the ground?
the campaign was confused with a barn


Well, this is PPC, there are no words, how could you screw this up?
Well done.
It's obviously a grain elevator, how can you be embarrassed like that? Intelligence sucks.
The grandchildren of the grandfathers who defeated the Nazis are repeating the exploits of the Nazis! Bravo!
Am I the only one who is confused that Canada is silent if this is THEIR granary? or was there more than just grain there?
It’s been a week since the Ministry of Defense has been disgracing itself with this video, peek-a-boo, downs, don’t you want to clean up your mess?)
What the hell are oil storage facilities? they bomb a granary to drive the opposition into famine. Putin is waging the wrong war and with the wrong people.
the damage is considered acceptable.
Why are our military such suckers? How about blowing up flour?
Why don't the tanks explode?
And who told you, the authors of this video, that this is an oil storage facility, and not some kind of elevator?
Putin's falcons are heroic. the beggar of Russia rejoices
All Ukrainian media are happily trending that this is a grain elevator
we have already found out that these swindlers did not bomb an oil warehouse, but a GRAIN STORAGE
I think if anyone wanted tragedy, the entire building would be destroyed. and not from the edge.
Only someone who has simply never seen either one can fail to distinguish an oil storage facility from an elevator. In general, the locals were deprived of food. Scorched earth mode. This is how the Germans acted against Russia at one time, for which they paid dearly.
The elevator of the flour mill, not the oil storage.
I understand that the &quot;Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation&quot; considers the Khuilostans to be extra-chromosomal morons, but to post THIS in the public domain...
Yes, you are driving everything here, it was a warehouse for hexogen, that’s why the dust is white, on the website satellite.rf of the main Russian search engine it is written so. and Googlemaps is an imperial-fascist propaganda site.
The grain also needs to be destroyed so that ISIS doesn’t have anything to eat!
No one has canceled the boomerang rule. So, get ready, dear Russians.
A 20-liter canister of gasoline and two hoses were found there. Therefore, it is considered a non-technical storage facility.
The granary was bombed! Well done! So let's win! :facepalm:
Russian noobs...

Thats the grain elevator not oil tanks xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

yeah precision weapon blind eye in action
What prevents you from placing a tank for fuel and lubricants inside a silo? Would naive Turkic-Arabs really have to put up a poster over every oil storage facility: “There’s oil here.” Bomb here." ? Oh, I can’t get over these commentators on “other people’s mistakes” ))))
Russia's only goal is to bomb the infrastructure of CIVILIAN RESIDENTS (the opposition to ASSAD) and SURVIVE them from this earth, make them REFUGEES and a pain in the ass for the EU. :( that is, doing dirty tricks on your neighbors is the GREATNESS OF RUSSIA that the Kremlinites tirelessly repeat about??? Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, and before that Lithuania, Poland, Georgia... Have you poor poor people been infringed upon everywhere? There are fascists everywhere? and by should everyone give a shit about this?. You are left without allies. NORTH KOREA is your friend forever and NO ONE else. They are disdainful. Another year or two of such fucked-ups and everyone will turn away from Russia.
Have you ever seen elevators up close? The bitch specialists came running.
Oil was sprinkled on grain or grain was sprinkled with oil, but you can hardly tell.

It doesn't even look close to LPDS. These are elevators.
Looks like a grain elevator...
what intelligent dialogues on the ministry’s channel)))) the audience and the leadership found each other - some call any infrastructure oil (from granaries to customs terminals), others eat it all and foam at the mouth (and swear on the tongue) defend this illusion they have been sucked into - stability!! the whole world will collapse if you don’t trust the leadership, then who?! You can’t trust yourself... you can’t even allow yourself to think)))
Well, we've screwed up, so why post it?!
@lyat! they bombed the elevator and are bragging about it to the whole world... What a shame, what degradation... :(((The oil storage facility is burning with black flames! And in the video there are clouds of flour... How can one not remember Lavrov with his catchphrase: &quot; Morons, "fuck"?!!
Oil doesn't burn these days :). Storytellers.
Here is another “oil storage” bombed by the RoISS: <a href=""> And this is GSI’s proposal for farmers who need somewhere to store the “oil” removed from the fields: <a href="">
Granary bombed lol.
Why doesn’t the oil burn after the bombing?
The destruction of civilian infrastructure is a war crime. A gallows for Kremlin crooks is already being repaired in Nuremberg.
Idiots! Oil burns with black smoke, not white.
Why was the ELEVATOR bombed? Does Putler take the Russians for morons?
Looks like Russia is supporting Bagdadi&#39;s state ?

Except that&#39;s not oil. There&#39;s no fire from the destruction. Russian lies. Those are granaries.

We urgently need to give the pilots a hero. To bomb a granary in the middle of a field, without any air defense, you need to have a lot of courage and skill...
How much grief does this Putin’s Raschka bring all over the world. Bombing a granary is already a war crime.
Damn, these are granaries... There is more oil and further from each other... Who is the Ministry of Defense fooling, its own people only...?
Ahaha, the creampies defeated the grain elevator. The armor is strong in the cast iron skulls, ololo.<a href=""> href="">
I want to believe with all my being and I’m trying to justify our idiots and the government, but, damn, do you really think we are such stupid suckers!!!???
It was grain storage western sources say? What was it at the end?

ISIS IS SHOCKED OIL WHITE.KANAL-ANAL (Russian Ministry of Defense)
Are grain and flour stored in oil storage facilities? And the oil storage facility among the fields?
too few pipes for a tank farm. the tanks are close together - this doesn’t happen at oil depots
Why didn't anything catch fire?
Tell me, am I the only one who first read “on the fur store”? ?
Fucking shame!
stranno!!! razbombili neftobazu, a paxnet xlebom...

I would like to ask the morons from the Moscow Region - since when did the elevator become an oil storage facility? Don’t you know what an oil storage facility looks like? Remove the video, don’t disgrace the country!! Idiots!!!
Attacks on elevators and treatment facilities of the Russian Aerospace Forces are fakes, stuffing of the enemies of our country.
Did the ISIS headquarters get covered? If they didn’t cover it, then it doesn’t count :)
But Russian idiots really believe that Russia bombed the oil storage facility. The most stubborn even claim that it was the State Department that replaced the photos of granaries on Google in order to blame Russia.
Why didn't the oil catch fire? Why is there no pajara after? Why didn’t the gas-air environment in other containers decompress after the explosion and create a huge BADABOOM with a week-long burning of oil? Or is it all because the grain doesn’t explode and doesn’t burn very well? or simply because you know absolutely nothing, but you need to report to someone about your work and show it to someone, you have to bomb granaries, bazaars, schools and hospitals...?
This is a grain storage elevator!
The granary was destroyed, morons! Where is the burning and spilled oil?! What freaks! And this is not Putin, all this is a bunch of Russian goblins. Putin only expresses THEIR views.
Russia continues to lie about its exploits in Syria. The GSI <a href=""> grain elevator is turning into an oil storage facility, although even a fool can see that the oil is burning with black smoke, not white.
<a href="#lang=en&amp;lat=35.601974&amp;lon=36.859131&amp;z=15&amp;m=b&amp;search=surman">#lang=en&amp;lat=35.601974&amp;lon=36.859131&amp;z= 15&amp;m=b&amp;search=surman</a> this granary is 500 km from the nearest ISIS positions! Putin and everyone who supports him will burn in hell!
As a person who has been working in a construction company for 15 years, I can confirm that this is a GRAIN STORAGE!!! . And this is without options. Oil storage facilities are built completely differently. Each complex is separate from the other and fenced off with a rampart or rampart around (cistern). And there is no elevator there)
It’s a lie, look at the videos on YouTube of how oil storage tanks explode beautifully and how difficult it is to extinguish them later, but here it’s anything but oil.
I have never seen oil storage facilities without the accompanying infrastructure - pumping stations, oil pipelines. the tanks are isolated.... It was probably a new brand of oil - grainy oil))) It grows in the fields and is collected by combines))) This is a failure, comrades... The next stage will be the transformation of Voronezh into radioactive ash - and they will show that they fucked up Washington
Oil doesn't burn like that! This is something not explosive (can be seen from the destruction) The Russian Federation is criminals!
This is just another elevator. Oil burns with black smoke. A complete lie!
attacking civilian targets is a war crime. This is a granary, the horse knows...
these are complete degenerates, there is nothing left, a little time left, 2-4 years and the driving of the crazy into a cage will begin
What kind of oil is it that burns with white smoke? Khutin probably invented...
The oil storage facility isn't on fire, maybe it's the elevator?
Is it an elevator? I don’t think that the Ministry of Defense is so incompetent as to confuse an elevator and an oil storage facility.
After all, this is an elevator :) But why should Russian TV viewers know about this?
In 2008 By order of Assad (!!!), the Canadian company Skyway Grain Systems built grain storage facilities in the northern part of Syria. Easy to google, look and compare. There can be no doubt, this is it. Oops.
Attacks on elevators and treatment facilities of the Russian Aerospace Forces are fakes, stuffing of the enemies of our country.
Hooray! Yesterday the shit purifiers were blown up, today the granary, comrades, we are moving towards victory!
The granary, even in Google it is marked as a granary. Wow, why don't you check Google Maps before your flight?
In fact, this is an elevator, a granary...
In fact, this is an elevator, granary
Lol, it turned out to be an elevator))) That’s why we had to bomb it twice, the containers didn’t detonate
Why is the smoke light?
And then we pass by again! Why didn’t they get into the tanks again!? Oblique!
Orcs from the Russian Defense Ministry are not able to distinguish a granary from an oil storage?
They're taking us for fools... it doesn't look like an oil storage facility at all... and in the middle of a field... yes...
Granary))) Tears welled up in my eyes, what will the peaceful opposition eat? Here the Su-34 combines unloaded some bread there, 500 kg packed in portions at once. Let Erdoganchik eat too. He still has a lot of such bread ahead of him...
Turkey will go bankrupt...

what the hell is an oil storage facility, dibiloids. This is the most common granary. I worked at something like this for 5 years.
they hit the wrong place - the storage facilities are empty....
it's empty
Airstrike on a granary. What to say. Well done. keep it up
So, are people here really so stupid that they can’t tell the difference between an oil storage facility and an elevator? at least look at what an oil storage facility should look like)))) what kind of suckers should you consider your Russian people to be putting such bullshit on public display?
These are grain storage .... Liers!

It will take a little time and Moscow and the surrounding area will also be covered...
hello fellow humans

Guys, this is not an ELEVATOR by any chance!!!!!!
Am I the only one who doesn’t understand why the oil didn’t catch fire? Or it caught fire, but then why is the smoke white?
Results of the destruction of the "oil storage": <a href="">
The granary was bombed, so we will win.
Why did the flour fly in all directions?
hmm... no explosion. there is no fire. Have you ever seen an oil storage tank burn, and for how long? More fakes for the god of fakes.
Gentlemen from the Moscow Region, this is what<a href="#lang=ru&amp;lat=35.597606&amp;lon=36.864085&amp;z=19&amp;m=b&amp;show=/34190735/Silos&amp;search=35.607271%2C%2036.852157"> #lang=ru&amp;lat=35.597606&amp;lon=36.864085&amp;z=19&amp;m=b&amp;show=/34190735/Silos&amp;search=35.607271%2C%2036.852157</a>silo (a container for storing bulk materials) there What ? Was there oil in the granules?
This is a granary, morons. What level of inadequacy must the Ministry of Defense have in order for a GRAIN STORAGE to be called an oil storage facility? And these morons are responsible for defending the country? A bunch of armchair warriors, their mother.
By the granary, idiots!
Actually, this is a grain elevator. <b>Grain elevator. Grain storage</b>.
some say it was a grain silo... but no confirm

How do the Russians pass off oil storage facilities as granaries - is it designed for people who don’t know how to think for themselves or what? Or do they really think that people are idiots?
You have to put it in the middle of the park, one bomb is enough.
The first bomb - three empty cans were destroyed...
What doe&#39;s destroying Grain Storage silo&#39;s have to do with fighting ISIS ???  Except starving the civilians.

<b>FOR "ONINE FALLED"</b> After the FAB hit, one container detonated. Then (at <a href="">0:20</a>) you can see how they dropped more RBCs with self-aiming elements. There they tried all the containers in a sieve.
The tanks are clearly homemade by bearded <a href="">#theyarechildren</a>. Oil storage facilities are too small - 500 tons.
Just an english comment passing through

@Manuel Garcia 828{~[]_[£€[&lt;[2€^|13€66+867£[=no
Howdy

some one please translate

Fake video

please write something else tha cyrillic

Burn, burn clearly so that it doesn’t go out! Look at the sky, the birds are flying, the bells are ringing!
Oil storage facilities are not built like that, they are grain storage facilities, although for propaganda purposes, any cylindrical tank in Syria is automatically an oil storage facility. By the way, there is definitely no oil there; you can see how quickly they go out after an explosion.
Donald Trump was right. AGAIN.

The tanks and layout of the site in no way correspond to the oil storage facility. Judging by the galleries above the silos and the close location of the containers, this is more of a granary. example here <a href="">
At <a href="">0:11</a> someone’s arms and legs are flying)))
this is grain
didn't hit the center
There is no explosion, no fire - the tanks are empty. Is it ISIS in Es-Saura?
Why are vacuum bombs not used? I really can't understand...
Why not in the center???? They promised that the rocket could even hit the window!!!
How accurate! Accuracy - the politeness of kings!
Is this what... people are scattering?
Wheat silos.

these are elevators, you can see right away, at the top you can see conveyors for filling grain, and there are no clouds of smoke and fire... oil storage facilities have a different look
1-2 containers exploded, I see black smoke where? Why didn't others do it?
Please explain, was it filmed from Platan, what is on the Su-34?
and it's all? 2 measly storage facilities? It's a scam, I thought everything would be on fire...
Planes are flying - hello Erdogan!
empty barrels (
Import substitution makes itself felt... . We have a problem with electronics and optics... .
PAST A LITTLE
But really, a completely logical question: why don’t they hit the center of the storage facility? After all, the chance of detonation of neighboring tanks in this case is much higher. In this video, one was blown up, and even then it was empty. It's a bit expensive for the Moscow Region's budget, don't you think? At least they explained it clearly enough for the average person to understand, if they are going to post the video for everyone to see...
Well, the idiots you serve... This is silage. (warehouse for storing bulk materials such as cement, sand, grain, feed, granules, etc.)
FOR YULIA BULEEVA
It’s a pity that the tanks were empty so everything would have detonated
I am the son of a Tractor Driver from ISIS, everything is ambiguous here! The balloon storage facility was bombed!
Everything acquired through backbreaking labor: three oil storage tanks, three bases for training terrorists, an oil column... three)<a href="">
Why the hell didn’t it catch fire!!!!! There were empty barrels(
Sorry, that is NOT an &#39;oil storage facility&#39;... Those are GRAIN SILOS for wheat, barley, oats or rapeseed.Well done, you just blew up a few thousand loves of bread!

At least once we ended up in an empty storage facility... But it somehow looks a lot like a grain elevator.
I can imagine how drivers started building brick houses on the roads)
oil is going to rise in turkey
It would be great if some ministry employee responded to the comments) I’m wondering why they didn’t sandal it in the center, but just barely at the edge.
in rags
empty :(
Drivers on the roads are already used to it. They drive as if nothing happened
Empty or what?
How is it in the film: Well, bro? The family budget has collapsed
Hello guys from AVAI. Put out the freaks of your sidekick.
Erdogandon is sad
looks more like a granary))) you can’t see that there is oil there
