Nobody in bollywood can give speech like this   love from our country india

&quot;Your achievements go beyond just acting , your versatility as an actor and ability to bring depth to diverse roles have left an indelible mark on our country .&quot;SRK 

He&#39;s such an intelligent intelectual and a good influence as an actor and most importantly as a human being  on the world 

It&#39;s 6 years, He is still the same gem he was then.

My personal opinion of his eloquent articulation is that it is his memory which transcends beyond his spontaneity of thought.

Dear Shah Rukh Khan ...You taught us How to love and How to be  loved ?not just in your cinemas but in real life also.SRK the Pride of India 

I loved loves loves you sir!! SRK ! You are a great man of all religions!! So much respect  ! Loves is the answer to all. Lord Buddha!! All the gods and angels  loves you! ️️️🇰🇭🇰🇭🇰🇭🇺🇸
The clarity and insight of this content are refreshing. A book with related subjects expanded my understanding. &quot;The Art of Meaningful Relationships in the 21st Century&quot; by Leo Flint

A great philosophical thinker .

Srk is a university himself we could learn somethingFrom him everytime i amazed to see him and Feel blessed that he is an indianHow lucky we areSome countries of world may know india because of srk.....Love this man alot

Genius man in the world so lovely man and golden heart @srk

Great Respect for you, your life is inspirational, proud of you Sir

Is he using a teleprompter of some sort?

One of the best Ted talks I ever heard....He talks so gracefully and you will enjoy each and every moment.

Love isn&#39;t saleable

Great Dr UAK

November 20th, 2023He&#39;s such a cool person!! Can&#39;t wait to watch this interview

Now I need Abhishek Bachchan to do a TedTalks as well. I love his speeches.

Look at this guy where gave him fame and money than he blames back that country and loves to go pakistan  everyday supporting Pakistani societies launching actor and actresses from Karachi and Islamabad than making such movies like raees to encourage people become criminal all Pakistan politics in blood of these people ️

Proud of sarukhan 

Nice speaking love 
Self made star 
He is loved more for his common man&#39;s qualities than his acting. Love for his acting is just a manifestation of him being human coupled with his witty, charming and make it believe intelligent persona. ....... and that&#39;s what a man should be in order to be the most appealing one of his time  !

Love and only love to the best lover of the WORLD. &quot;&quot;SRK&quot;&quot;@srk

That&#39;s SRk

solid 20min set

He is a top notch person .

Shah Rukh Khan is part of the Illuminati!

A true Gem. I only know India through him 

This proves that SRK is also a stand-up comedian. There&#39;s nothing that this man cannot do!!

How could TED talkers talk so fluently?  Is there any prompter in front?

watching this for the 50th time

Mind blowing Talk.  I  am not in love with you but from the movies I have seen of you, and as you said, I do agree,  you are THE WORLD&#39;S BEST LOVER. You might laugh at this but I have always dreamed of doing the Waltz with you   

the fact that he can make light of such a dire and harrowing experience such as his father&#39;s death in order to explain things about humanity is a testament to how well spoken and intellectual SRK is. What a man.

SRK
it literally looks like he is reading from a prewritten script  , nothing&#39;s natural bro

The amount of andhbhakts and boycott gang literacy put together Shah rukh spoke it in first two minutes

My goodness. Beaten to youthfulness again

Biggest inspiration SRKLoving compassion 

Is Shahrukh Khan the only actor who can say such words
gutkha guy, fairness cream, liquor seller

Today I&#39;ve seen a very different, far from the bollywood, a nervous speaker tried to make the audience believe that he is a good speaker....              Respect SRK.  

Mere kuch smj nahi aaya, but sunke bhut acha laga, Proud on SRK
More Witty u r, More love to u.

Thats why I am his fan 

Im very lucky to witness his era 

The last of Stars! THE SHARUKH KHAN️

Salute to this man for representing India on a global platform, Salute to this man for giving us such masterpiece movies like Swadesh ,Devdas,veerjara,kal ho na ho,Jawan,Darr and etc etc.Salute to this man for  teaching us how to love ,how to express,how we can do something for our countries betterment,Salute Shahrukh ......️️️

What A Man!!!

I love listening to him.  His voice has an effect on you somehow, at least it does on me.  He&#39;s charming, humble, and very very polite.  He actually cares about how you are.

Greatest star of Bollywood to learn lots of life lessons

I am 21 and still i got nothing from this talk, i tried my best to understand as much i can but still got nothing but after seeing comment section i realized that there is something that I&#39;m not able toh catch, is there any one toh help me out in simple way. Yeah i know you may think I&#39;m stupid but i don&#39;t think so cause i am still trying 

I love SRK
I love You So Much Sir
Besides everything it is really unimaginable that no actor/actress comes in TED talk to gives their opinion because they all are believe in just showbiz but Actor like Shahrukh Khan are very few. &quot;Salute and heartily standing ovation to him&quot;  Proud of India 🇮🇳

He is among  the greatest people our country has !!!  Huge respect sir!!

What is the name of the poem he recited?

Amazing...how flowlessly he delivered his speech, no one can match his ability to create positive atmosphere in the stage and in the mind of listeners. May  God bless.

He&#39;s Awesome

I so love him. Big brother 

Love you Sir

My heart swells with pride after reading the comments...How people all over the world is showering their love for him...My all time favorite Shahrukh Khan...I just hope that people in India understood him and his ideologies a little bit more...and stop trolling him...he isnt just a bollywood star but an amazing human being...

Yes women want to know what a man is about and what he thinks snd feels to improve relationship. I am not looking to have 10 dates before i find out what i want. Women dont feel privileged because i work extremely hard physically emotionally mentally financially to make it work but its good to know men have their challenges too like keeping their pants on in front of a beautiful woman 

It amazes me that how effortlessly he can speak in a language that is not his native language. He is not just speaking but he is doing so with perfect voice modulation, pauses etc. And its not a five minute speech its a 17 minute long speech which has verses in Hindi. To remember all that and to articulate it in such an elegant manner takes some doing. he is an excellent speaker and industry(bollywood/Hollywood)  can utilise him in a much better manner. Forgive me for my ignorance if I have made a big deal out of this speech. I am truly amazed and inspired by this man’s seemingly effortless style of speaking.

Sharu khan
I loved the TED talk! He began very enthusiastically but SRK would be better if he had been himself rather than reciting a script. Honestly he is more witty than that

anyone knows the name of the poem ? . thx!

I have seen anyone praise India like he did

Damn how did he mug up such a long speech with great vocabulary!No doubt he is witty and smart and hardworking and one of a kind !! SRK 

Apart from being a actor, He is intelligent, educated, wise with a great sense of humour.

hes so cool
Im not his fan, not at allBut believe me, God Made him differently:)His astrological chart tells everything, totally self-made guy

IDK why these senseless MFs are laughing.., while he is telling about the moment he lost everything?Whatever...., I&#39;ve heard about TED talk, where listeners are said to be educated people , but here it is totally opposite,Those who laughed at him on that day, will suffer the same..., and then lemme see whether they laugh or not.Senseless stupid waste of society. 

He is the biggest superstar across in Bharat and so  he is the easy target who targeting, become famous, to come on limelight , nothing else. Don&#39;t mi d my english just feel

This man is perfect representation of our country &amp; culture!! 

Love him


Anyone here after his Jawan Movie?

Who is here after jawan

i waas 5 year old when i watched his movie chahat in lakshmi nagar Delhi Radhoo palace.

Wow. I&#39;m stunned. Never underestimate a person (you do not know)! Thx for the speech.

He deserves Bharat Ratna.
Why would you even bring an actor to talk about humanity? It doesn&#39;t matter how &quot;well put together&quot; actors appear in public. Behind closed doors they&#39;re rapists, pedophiles, narcissists or straight up psychopaths. The film industry only sells a dream. It&#39;s a trap set by cruel terrorists. The film industry is run by evil individuals. Bring real people with real life experiences.

Now I understand why he and Priyanka fell in love. They&#39;re simply so perfect for each other

Brother, no one can drive without learning driving. Because every corner of the story has been heard. ...actor h bc to every place he started acting...chutiye log ise bhagwan samajte h...
I can watch him on loop 

SRK
i always admire his speech... he is a living GEM....Love from Kuwait....

The legend of cinema srkAnd power of srk fans

I am Waiting for jawan movie

The ultimate King

Just a awrsome speech

I never knew SRK is such a deep thinker, prolific speaker and highly intelligent. His vocabulary commands is exceptional. If he is not simply an actor, he could easily be an academic or an orator. Proud of my all time fav Hollywood actor. An Australian here.

ccD
Well articulated and an excellent talk  <a href="">0:40</a>

One needs to listen to this a few times to get the complete essence of it. So deep. So wise. Shshrukh Khan is the most eloquent speaker ever.

First video commented on 

Thank you so much for your feedback.

We are working extremely hard to solve the problems of the students.

Your feedback is important for us.

His humour is just flying over the audiences head

he stole my 17 minutes

learn from him how to be when the crowd doesn&#39;t quite follow along the act

Greatest lesson you can learn from SRK: Preach after being rich or sucessful.True words.

SRK&#39;s new movie JAWAN releasing on 7th September. If you manage to find some time please watch.- a request from srk fan️

Srk
I am here to hear to speak ....he is a speaker..the best in india

Thank You Sir for being there 

Great respect for our Bollywood King  I can feel the biasedness in that room for him. He really did it excellently while getting cold shoulder from everyone..

King ️
Such a down to earth man he is... With his generosity and simplicity he makes you feel that everything  is possible...

If not actor.... He can be a great Stand up comedian

amazing! most of the time i was searching google for new words <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a> adolescence <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/HvgfY93GEYmqvwLUuYDwAQ"></a>

India proud of youSRK

This is a Punjabi Muslim.

Wow.... Sharing words of Wisdom with so much Humility Love moves the World!

Lifelong appreciation to SRK

I was never a fan of SRK. Aamir remains my favourite. But as I&#39;ve grown older, I have now come to admire SRK. His wit is incomparableI&#39;m glad he quoted from Kabir who&#39;s also my favourite poet.

He&#39;s a blend of acting, humanity, character, religion &amp; love 

With Shahrukh even Ted Talks become Standup Comedy

proud of india

SRk Pride of India

SRK you make us proud everywhere you go everything you do thank you so much

His degree in mass communication has done a world of good for him

Some society has come to make me laugh too.
Srk sir your thoughts are nice and your way of communication is excellent

Yes definitely love is one thing that you should speak about and mankind... After spreading kesar guttka and pan ads... Something done to your kids hurts and then remember love and compassion for the mankind... While others suffer with cancer by your ads doesn&#39;t hurts... As you are earning by spreading pan gutka ads some other earning by making your sons videos... It&#39;s just a karma of what you did....

SRK
Hate him, enemy him but you cannot ignore him. But I think he&#39;s the perfect example of India and its culture. Greatest actor and human ever for the mankind.

Best speech ever. Reviving the sense of humanity and its life and real power of continuity. &quot;Love&quot; a chakra you start with and end at

Amazing soul god&#39;s man
I&#39;m impressed 
SRK is the best actor️

How long would it take to mug up this entire speech?

Since childhood...and say by day I fallen into immense love with this guy....love you sir 

pehle vimal bechna band karo,cancer promote karna band karo....fir yeh backchodi karna

Love is nothingWork is everything.......

He is so intellectually articulated I don’t know if this is scripted by srk is witty

I love you, Shah Rukh Khan.
Not only me but the whole world loves SRK

SRK is SRK his thoughts &amp; feelings coinside with the BUDDHA  LONG LIVE SRK.

World&#39;s Biggest Super STAR  SRK
Ted!

Pride of india 

Me at my speech to get 5 marks in 10th grade:-

&quot;Seems a bit careless of me now&quot;  how can he make the harsh reality into comedy.... Immense sence of humour, he is really well spoken

He is a gem.

I am grateful that I found SRK and all Indian films. Much love to north and south India. Jai Hind.

I’m new to Bollywood but if you haven’t seen SRK films, you are missing out big time. He’s got a few stinkers here and there like everyone but his best movies are incredible films. There is a reason he is the biggest movie star in the world outside of the West.

Life Lesson for Srk
Mohan Bhargav from Swades !! U r !! Salam sir ji !

His humour and knowledge is far beyond an ordinary man&#39;s comprehension. That&#39;s why people judge his actions and inactions.

Im so so proud of myself to be his fan..I mean just look at him. What a true gentleman he is, blessed with wisdom and wittiness. I have seen many people criticising my choice to love him as an actor, but I never gave a damn back then during my childhood,  nor will I now.I have huge respect and immense love for him.His movies made me realize what love could be.A self made man, a great actor, an amazing family man, a wonderful speaker and the list goes on and on.My only desire is to meet or atleast see him once in person .God bless you SRK .

no words to describe but this ted talk felt like everything, everywhere all at once.&quot; Sha Rukh sir is like perfection at its peak. He is that great&quot; . Him talking in English didn&#39;t felt like English , it was the same feeling When I hear my mother tongue Hindi, He speaks with such honesty and tenderness of love in his words.

The contemplation with himself makes him ingenious ....

Jio bhaut badyaaa 
How he loves his country  in a whole speech he mentioned about india at every moment though out his speech and enlightened to foreigners like what our country teaches us in positive way.. Hats off to Srk.. 

Yes you country is spreading enlightenment heppines and joy in Kashmir with the laughing guns

All time favorite SRK god bless you

SRK is Illuminati!

Wow what a great guy. Thank you for being you.

He has such a great aura , witty ness yet modest, greatest superstar ,he had a dream that every corner of the world know him through his Hindi films that has became true ...

This guy is living in his own utopia... hopefully he would have taught these things to his son first 

He&#39;s king and king is king he&#39;s not only our biggest ever superstar but he&#39;s the most humble and hardworking and inspiring star ever. My hero of my life and my biggest inspiration.Srk srk srk forever

 father of drug addict

He is the greatest inspiration for every aspiring artist.. no words of praise are enough for this man.. 

NO HAS EVER UNDERSTOOD AND I THINK NEVER WILL REALISE THE AMAZING MIND SMART AND ACTIVE BUSINESS SENSE OF HIM..2ND RICHEST ACTOR KEVAL KINDNESS SE NHI BANTA AADMI, USKA MIND AUR SOCH PEHLE SE BHOT AAGE KA THA

Omg.i feel really lucky found this video ...entire time i had a smile on my face ..i felt so mesmerized ...i manifest that before i die i meet him ..i mean by seeing virtual he&#39;s giving this much positive impact ..idk wht hppn when i ll meet him....my love has increased 10 times more 

He is a beggar of Kauri and has no more money. &quot;Bolo zuba keshri&quot;.
Sorry Mr SRK I would like a Harley Davidson drive before my Ted talkHugh Jackman 

He is citing his pain and people are laughing, I would say son be happy wherever you are. 

I have never seen SRK movies. But I respect him as a speaker who could use the language, English and Hindi so fluently, humerously and convey his ideas and thoughts from his heart.

All he did here to talk about how big is he 

Lines well remembered, all in one take! Truly a great actor  But yes, definitely tries to be a good person.

Heart winning session 
The way he conveyed his message of love and compassion is way ahead of time. He compared his life experience and humanity. How it became from simple to complex. Whoever wrote his speech did really great job. . Keep Shining and sharing love 

<a href="">5:30</a> angel
TED talks: ted ko india mein popular banane ke liye bakchodi karni hain...........international fame milega.....SRK: yes yes zaroooorMost of the crowd was absolutely silent....This talk had no effect on anyone

My life is similar to you at the age of my early 20&#39;s. Hope i end up like you in future

Whattt a Starrr What a Person SHAH RUKH KHAN !!!

The way he is speaking English, it seems to me that he is an experienced English professor who has stored innumerable number of uncommon words in his brain throughout his life and now using them in front of his disciples just to teach them properly.

There are two types of people in the world, those who like Sharukh Khan and those who lie and say they don&#39;t like him.

His wit 

Be onest motivation spike it not talented or self knowledge fat is deep soul journey to understand life living staly not oll abut why you have journey is discipline of self knowledge understand on identity destiny truth self dharma share value quality principles for oll love but unconditional since ti served so really good attitude following on self respect self love self discipline belence limits then can you motivation ir move parsonal value quality principles of light before should be know live life staly dharma direction wisdom of light

Amazing speech Sharukh ️️
Mla English nhi samjt tari aplya srk ​​sati purn video bgitla. lu srk
The great actor is a great philosopher too

The Greatest Of All Time

I learn alot of things from Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s all the interviews and speeches , help to stay motivated and be kind. Wisest man with the great humour. Love and only love for SRK ️

He acknowledged he is a Muslim but yet he is using Hindu philosophy A clear example that Hinduism is indeed a way of life WHAT A GUY INDIANS ARE WELCOME IN ANY PART OF THIS WORLD 

Kumar had created lies like that make me insecure n weak ... That I&#39;m carrying through my life ...

Sorry Sharukh ji I&#39;m older than you So no need you to feel bad ... Sorry sorry... I just suport his innocence that&#39;s it i didn&#39;t insult age i just forget your dance ... My last movie was chammaku challo i think ... Sorry x ji...

Then agree with me that only blessings n promises are true others things are lies in the Bible n other books ... That&#39;s why I left reading holy books ...

If ever there was an extempore Indian speaker (with the added skillset of being a consummate actor!) to hold an audience&#39;s attention and lead its ideology to a Godly value, it is none other than the King of Love, SRK.

Dear Sharukh Khan,I would like to take a moment to express my admiration for you as a person and as a great Indian. Your thoughts on humanity, fame, and love are truly inspiring and reflect your wisdom and compassion.Your words have the power to touch hearts and minds, and your actions have brought joy and hope to millions around the world. Your commitment to making a positive difference in society is a testament to your generous spirit and your dedication to making the world a better place.Your achievements and contributions are a source of inspiration for generations to come.Thank you for being a shining example of what it means to be a good human being and a proud Indian. May your light continue to shine and inspire many more.Sincerely,Aidid

really srk is gem of india .sorry let me correct he is gem of the whole world.

Amazing speech.... And even he added Sanskrit quotes!!!!

He is a good person i dont no why indian hate him as a Muslim 

his communication is exceptional yaar

Love from Pakistan

My gf once said she dont like SRK,I showed her this video.

The sun is shining on the society Love to the king of bollywood :- Shahrukh khan ️️️
Did he write this himself? He is a fantabulous orator. His body language is remarkable!!!

Perfect person to represent our country globally ️

You&#39;re a great soul filled with love. Thanks for spreading joy and wisdom.

He is a gud speaker

Sue Stowers: Great speech full of admiration!

Perfect person to represent India, unlike goofballs like ranveer singh etc.

He is no doubt an exceptional orator, as we all know. But if he has written the whole lecture all by himself, then must be considered among the super brilliant men in history.

Sir, after taking out this much knowledge, there is a lot of anger in the mouth...but in India there are atrocities against Muslims.
I would prefer listening to jordan peterson or Ken robinson

I&#39;m  seeing in 2023 but his each words truly unbelievable  uncompareble   he is gem of indian cinema 

A real ambassador of humanity with grace ...

Teach

Only king do this

The ideal person in my life 

Loved it!

The one and only shah ruk khan.....

UNBELIEVABLE-SPEECH-!

Legend srk
Amazing! Truly 
Being a genuine ted talk viewer.. this is one of awakening ted talk I have ever seen!! Huge bow to him!

He will always be the most beloved personality in India. Shah Rukh Khan is the true face of India, he is an icon, he is the legend that we will always be heard of.

SRK 
Love you SRK, well said!

Now a days real scholars sit at the back of the auditorium, and the hypocrate, little educated and good looking people became the teacher of countries and the world. Shame to all of us, allowing them to come so far.

This man is my everything. This man is my Utopian Utopia. And I will believe so till the last breath.

I hate you.. You are a Muslim.. So your should told assalamualaikum.

typical white audience. unappreciative. dumb even.

OMG this man is awesome 

fake stories.

when he started the hindi i got goosebumbs

What a speech and what a way to speech...talented beyond words   

Amazing as always!!!!

Definitely the king of love ️

Lovely 

SRK is great personality but not greater than the Nation, India

bc i am from india ️
srk words like a poem

His oratory skills also made him an international star something what likes of Salman/Aamir lack, the Only Indian Movie star i love to listen, very knowledgeable with wits and humors in between

whole speech feels scripted

The listeners are very bad.

See his vocabulary, wisdom &amp; depth of thought ️

I, being a muslim and so are you expected to open your salutation with Islamic way by uttering &quot;Assalamu alaiqum&quot;. Then, you could throw other ways of salutations like &quot;Namaskar/Adab&quot; in Hindi or &quot;Good evening&quot; in English. Dear Shah Rukh, your sky-high fame as a film actor has made you blind about Islam. I understand, maybe, you were afraid that your lslam-loving attitude might hinder your journey towards being present-day Shah Rukh Khan. please keep in mind Hindus or Christians alone are not your fans; Muslims love you, watch your movies, take pride in you as well.

Despite a SuperStar he is Nations Top 5 best Speaker &amp; communicator.

<a href="">11:10</a> to <a href="">12:00</a>

So well educated Guy SRK.No wonders that&#39;s why he is so loved by the whole world.

this man has my whole respect and love

Amazing stuff
Srk&#39;s english is fabulous.

Your acting, philosophy, attitude, etc I like very much   you are really great sir

When migration was just about Siberian crane 

Love you SRK ️
SRK is the biggest Motivation for many people...

Really you are great!

Must say proud of you

SRK 
the audience is so meh...boring

SRK is Gem

Shahrukh Khan is a great speaker

The Greatest thing which makes him a patriot is during whole video he was trying to represent his country INDIA

I relate to the perspective of Freedom with the Speaker

Inspirational

Love you srk 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
The only sir I respect after my family ️️

Wow... srk.. i love your thoughts...

What a beautiful spokesperson

No words are sufficient to explain the thoughts that have emerged from your speech sir

how can people laugh while he taking about his fathers last hours

KIng Khan
 From R.V.RajithapriyaAryankhan.
THANKYOU..

It&#39;s so disheartening to see few people of his own country calls him a terrorist/anti-indian/anti-nationalist inspite of doing everything throughout the years for his countrymen aka indians. Khan Sahab doesn&#39;t give a damn about those few negative people and he doesn&#39;t need to prove over n over again that he is a true indian; in fact he&#39;s the biggest &quot;deshbhakt&quot; of india️️️

He is representing our India&#39;s spirituality over the materialistic world.

Why are these crazy people laughing at his emotional stories  wtf whats wrong with ths creepy audience  This is seriously cringe  feeling bad for him  3 mins into this vdo and I&#39;m out 

Incredible speech SRK sir.. i went speechless after seeing this..

He is not an actor he is an emotion

Only srk is carrying bollywood.

SRK..the name is enough..we love you srk️
Just Wow 

SRK
Great fan of You Sir️

Such a very inspiring

me be the this all world kows you did u r allah knows you.

One of a kind. You can&#39;t help  but love him

shah rukh khan is definitely an intelligent, wise human being..amazing speech 

WTF. People are laughing at jokes of his fathers death but not at &quot;apple was still then just a fruit&quot;.. that is truly tragic..

What are his thoughts on promoting racism and classism by doing commercials for skin whitening cream ?

Worth reflecting   ...‍️
how humorous he is!

Love you SRK from Sri Lanka 

<a href="">11:56</a> the greatest lover the country has ever seen

Mr.SRK is always in our hearts,a good motivational speaker with full of positivityLove u sir

This sounds like a poetry
Who has come after seeing the Pathan?

The way you speak in public and connect with people tell lots about you. It&#39;s not the character in your movies.

King khan
The magic of SRK 

Is he has is a Magnet  ? The more u listen him the more he attract u .                         Lot&#39;s of love king  

I find this guy so fuckin over rated. He thinks he&#39;s funny and very intelligent. He&#39;s a terrible actor unlike Naseeruddin and Irrfan

And that&#39;s our SRK️

These eyes will not be covered...
Omg! I am simply in awe of this man every time I hear him speak. This man is truly a legend literally. He is single-handedly teaching the world the language of kindness and love. Every time I am sad about something I&#39;ll just turn to him and his wise words show me the right path and am back in the spirit. He is a source of joy, wit, love, kindness, grace and all things goodness.

As a little kid growing up in somaliland I’ve always loved and still do all Indian movies, actors and actresses thank you king SRK we love you

Definitely sad for those that haven&#39;t seen you work SRK 

Thank you so much Boss
So simple to understand but sadly  too hard to be obtainable. Wonderful, wise words from a truly humble man.

Mr. ur real hero always my
He is making useless advertisement and talking about humanity.
The best actor in the world

Love this guy every time, the eloquence, the humor, the wisdom is just amazing, all time superstar.

I repeat no other actor in India, has been the king of words as he is

Man is  a great thinker with such a genius mind. More than just an actor!!! Thanks for representing India in front of the world

Global icon Shah Rukh khan (SRK)
Once in an interview he said &quot;he is the last of the stars&quot; he really mean it The country will never produce a star like this man ️

GLOBAL SUPERSTAR SHAHRUKH KHAN 
I don&#39;t know about Acting or creativity but hats off to u sir ,Srk such a wonderful speaker...

Intolerant puppet..... Funding the enemy country

What an Orator! SRK 

<a href="">13:00</a> that mystic poet name is Kabir das

SRK thank you for this talk. I have learned and it has helped me alot in my thoughts :)

LEGEND

I still somehow feels that he’s one of the most underrated actor in the world

his humour

LEGEND

Global superstar SRK 
Sir you should have to leave the bollywood industry, join the Hollywood 

HUMANITY

The man... ️We love you shah rukh khan ️
Listening it in my college for some English lab activities

Great inspirational speech by one of the greatest actors

In regards of who you&#39;re going to accept into your own personal life; you need to develop the skill to know when to build bridges and when to build walls... Both things exist for a reson, because time machines don&#39;t...

Awesome! The marriage of wit and depth.

Que @ hub

Discarded + Discriminating

Super star in the world.... love you

His English is like a music which feels so bleesed to my ears!

King Khan.
SRK

Wow yes survival is tough for some was for me. And those that speak of humanity should practice it too.this guy is so funny

His sense of humour is just op

I opened dictionary evey second

This is BY FAR THE BEST.

He is a role model most down to worth actor , I learn something from him never give up. He was thrown out from little srudions in early 80&#39;s after near decade his first three movies were mega blockbuster, lately he was most earned actor that crosses holly wood actors, and become one of most top three influential celebrities across globe. I remember his saying  one our Bollywood actors will earn in dollars as per stardust magzine. Now we can see all khans are in Bollywood are earning more then hollywood actors.Every success full person has to go throughout a unsuccessful time depends upon how long it span  is,,,,,

Only someone as magical as Shahrukh Khan can narrate something so painful @<a href="">2:00</a> and make it humorous ️

i LOVE THIS!!!

That standing ovation 

Sometimes it just feels that I am giving this talk. I&#39;ll be genuine to my core. I haven&#39;t ever had this much similarity to anyone other than him. I have seen many of his interviews and everytime I feel that &quot;WTF!!! Exactly the answer which I had thought&quot; PS: Yes I am also handsome like him (without putting in much effort). But ofc I am still much much younger than him. Don&#39;t know what and how I will be when I reach his age. Just bless me and wish that I can also make an impact on humanity (in a good way) like him,  cause it&#39;s (coincidentally) exactly <a href="">03:00</a> IST (Indian standard time) when I am posting this comment and I have spent all my day infront of my laptop to code a quantum circuit which can once n for all solve the the question &quot;Why is Universe moving in direction of more randomness&quot; (entropy increase). God bless you whoever reads this comment !!! Hare Krishna !!! La illaha il lalaha !!!

Wow, I Love You Shah

India is proud of you SRK

No1 can match his level in entire bollywood.. he is unique..

Proudly living in the country of srk...️India ️

Baadshah ️ indeed Shahrukhji

Love you SRK

Portugal capital

Shahrukh gem yaar. I am also on the same path.
Shahrukh Khan son of a Chief Engineer 'Mr. Taj Mo. Khan' and an award winning Oxford degree holder mother 'Lateef Fatima' , , , .1. Tried justifying his third son legitimacy (that no logical person asked for, we don't need your useless explanation for even if he's a love child that's your affair your matter)2. The pothi is lying there in the world, moo, not bhua, moo. , The writer of the script wrote something wrong and you just read it? Don't you know a single line of Hindi poetry on your own? , , What a great way to do PR (ie improve your public relation)Indeed he's worked his way up. , , But guess what he's a bodybuilder on steroids
Proud of our country 🇮🇳️

Thank u.

Most anti indian
I have watched this Ted 10times but is still not enough.I love u so much SRK.I wish I can see u.Love from Nigeria 🇳🇬

Human greatness is priceless!

Remarkable as Always, Bravo SRK

<a href="">14:09</a>-<a href="">15:43</a>

He speak very nice but also doing rummy ads

And that&#39;s a classy person

Who is watching in 2022

wow

my biggest inspiration

Mr. Shah your talk was smooth like butter, I love the humor and the seriousness as well! 

His Speech always motivates us....

SONARiCE * SHOW * |X * FAiR * DAY *|X *

Best speech I’ve ever heard.

the amount of jokes that the audience kept missing

his storytelling is just like is acting....full of all the emotions.... sometimes i wonder his is really himself in his movies...which has made him a great actor..

SRK thank you man for everything ️...

God bless you

I love you Sir

A top class human being!Love,  Respect from BD

Waooo I love sharukh Khan he is the best Bollywood charming actor love it awesome speech

A Big fan of you Srk keep safe and Beautiful and humble as you are

I&#39;m unable to find an epithet to describe you Sir. You are an actor,father,husband,simple human being in one word you are GREATEST.

Wonderful speech Srk is gold for the india His passion is very inspire and the sense of humor he has I have never seen in any other person.

Man, I can listen to this man all day everyday for the rest of my life

Actor, business man, philanthropist, world famous personality, intellectual,  no one  close to him ... he&#39;s the king khan ️

Some jokes didn&#39;t fire. But, that&#39;s what makes everyone, even srk human.. &quot;Reality became virtual and virtual became Reality&quot;. That&#39;s gonna resonate for a looooong time

Why do you guys eat grapes?
He is a magical personality

It&#39;s a goosebumps speech...

Greetings ​​ ‍‍‍‍‍‍‍   
Just love him how can anyone hate him …respect
great....

He has a prompter in his ears,someone wrote the speech,someone made him practice and someone guided him through his deliverance.But guess who gets the credit,charlatan khan,i mean shahrukh khan.

King ️
I respect his journey, his talent, him being the best at what he does, but tell me one thing, he talks about self love and goes on to endorse fairness and bleaching cremes countless times..why? I get about him earning money and it ultimately generating revenue but is it not exactly opposite to what he preaches?

Shahrukh khan sir my inspiration idol role model love from German

I&#39;m not a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. Still, I have watched this 5 times. I must admit that he is one of the best Public speaker of India. The best part about this talk was Shah Rukh started with Namaskar which shows he respects Indian Culture and he showed that he&#39;s a true Indian first and then a Muslim.

His obsession for self love is what we should abide. Thus its easy to give away and shower love.

It’s sad to see that some people call him traitor because media misinterpreted his words on intolerance . Here , in this speech he spoke about the greatness of india and her philosophies .

Watching this 7th time... Everytime learning something new.

Spread love

Love you SHAH ️
He (srk) is the real man, who comes from powerful places, whom we called India 🇮🇳

Amazing Sir.Respect increased and especially for mentioning Bharat in a positive Light.You are really very knowledgeable 

This guy is my favorite indian person

no matter how many time I just watch this episode it always gives me a booster to flourish and this man is just amazing I&#39;m always akin to his prosperity and internal strength to his country the way just he presents his country and culture is amicable. Love you King   

I love how he carries his indianess with him wherever he goes.

Hi dildar
Lit

Aid

Love you Shah!!! Pride of India 🇮🇳 Spread love not hate

How can someone hate him. How?

This is just like a poetry...So PROUD he is an Indian!!

He has excellent collection of words , appreciation for you sir.

He must lecture about the an origin of species too.!

People don&#39;t realised that SRK is also highly Self Educated and have Very high Intellectual Knowledge and wisdom in literature..... He&#39;s just the most Lovable and The onlt Actor in India who represents India so well into the Global Stage....just to name a Few he has the title of Dr. And while most celebs are ban in some countries or the other Shah Rukh Khan Is knighted by Malaysian and got the highest honor on France and so many other Countries...He is just The King of Bollywood and The Badshah of Bollywood... Don&#39;t call him King Khan For no reason

Wow this is sooo goood speech this will be push to think what is good or wrost for us

Srk ️
Love You Man!

Still watching (26/04/2022)️

All time my favourite one

The great

SRK is a greatest ever actor

Hey I am not interested in you ,You have commonly given birth to someone or gone mad at hizada I do want to know just stay away from me do not involve my name with you.Its so shameful for me.

It’s 2022. He was right back then, He is the last of stars.

I&#39;m not a fan of Shahrukh but the sheer flow in which this talk has progressed is overwhelming

Giving examples of India to spread love where hitters rule

His speech was okay, his stardom is worse; but his wit, charm and humour........ Now that&#39;s something I can&#39;t traverse 

He&#39;s spectacular 
I like shah rukh I am from Uzbikistan

Hello brather I am from  Uzbekistan

I feel pity for those who don&#39;t know SRK well enough or who don&#39;t admire him.He is a living legend!

The way he describe India and its culture is not everyones game i am his fan since i was born and i am 22 now and loves him and will love him forever and ever cause this man never ever should be hated he is what India means diverse and beautiful 

Don't make it shine by showing old clips!
Very disappointed by his speach writer the people stopped laughing on his humour just after the 2nd mint.There were too many jokes to digest so you start ignoring them.

Speechless. 
Too great speech

An Indian inspiring ️
is using botox dirty or something?

is using botox dirty or something?

Wah what English did you speak sir?
Absolutely brilliant

anyone has done note making and summary of this i am stuck here due to school work

The first movie that I ever watched as a kid was of SRK, I was then may be 4-5 years old but I fell in love with that 30 years old man. Gradually, growing up, I started watching more of his art films than his commercial dramas, then I realized my keen interest in Drama, theatrical culture, cinematography, direction, scripts etc., being a small town girl from a very common and middle class family, I was always told that the world I was dreaming of, was something I could never achieve, as a teenager I was told I can never make my ends meet in the show business, the eighteen years old me had to choose a carrier that wasn’t what I dreamed of ever. Even though I could never build up the courage to fight the stereotype of a small town middle class girl to become a writer/director in show business, I would say I wasn’t courageous enough to be SRK ever. I chose to be a mediocre, I chose to have a simple life that I never wanted to have, I chose to write comments in my phone on Ted Talks.I really would like to appreciate what SRK must have gone through to achieve what he is today, lots of love to SRK. I’m your fan forever.

But some stupid people compare him with Salman boi..

shah rukh khan is a book. he;s last of the stars.

Dear srk This is not a laughing place where u stand .talk like a gentle person.Don&#39;t show yourself like clown.Whatever u delivered it&#39;s a full wasting of time .

I am from India🇮🇳🇮🇳  just mesmerised.... These 18 minutes seemed too long &amp; influencing ......his voice is so attractive, actually I was lost for these 18 minutes ️️..........so good really 
i watch it again and again! he really is too much wenderful and smart person as human being! my most favorite person in my heart ️always 

One of the best speeches that I&#39;ve ever heard he&#39;s a truly amazing person I love this man I truly admire him and respect his craft

The real Cupid but happy to knew you as a genius. May God bless you and your family with a wonderful life.

NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

When SRK speaks, world listens.

I can&#39;t imagine me standing in front of this crowd for 17 minutes

I am proud of him. I am glad that this guy is from my country ️️ love you Sahrukh.

Everytime I watch I relate to something new Very well said and written

Who is watching this for English project??

Why they are laughing all the time

Adore him. I’m a black American woman. I’m only saying this because I love his films, I love the beauty of Bollywood….the music, dance, heartfelt stories, it’s like poetry. Beautiful culture and great food. I can sit through a Bollywood film and enjoy it if it were 5 hours lol

Lovely 
Most inspiring celeb for me

Terribly Outstanding. Love is the only thing we humanity have close to magic.

<a href="">5:42</a>

The guy who&#39;s gaining love respect and representing India to the whole world beautifully is getting hate propaganda back to back in his own nation 🇮🇳

Scripted lecture 
Great man with great Wisdom 

One day I&#39;ll meet srk..

Amazing! ️️️️️️️️️
He is the gift of our generation.Stay well..&quot;Dear actor&quot;.

He&#39;s a true gentleman and a Mentor if you&#39;re seeking great Aura, he has everything to teach you.

Love You SRK Sir ️ Fan Of Yours Till Last Breath
His Words Are Heal To Pain ️
Haters Call Him Hakla/Bakra As He Did A Just Of Role Stammer In Darr Movie And It Created A Impact On Their Mind That He Stammers In Reality But They Forgot Many Times That He Has Been Invited To Various International Universities For Giving Speech Like In Yale University, Edinburgh University In Shot SRK Haters Ki Gaand Jalti Rahegi Aur SRK Haters Ka Bhosada Phatta Rahega

I like SRK&#39;s personality very much. One should learn from him the way of thoughts, He is such a humble, hardworking and positive man.. And the best of everything is he believes in himself the most Love u Shah Rukh.. Keep Ruling King

His son is getting caught for different reasons these days

I COME FROM TWO <b>INDIA</b>WHERE WE HAVE VIR DAS AND <b>SHAH RUKH KHAN</b> .WHEN LIFE GIVES U A STAGE U BETTER REPRESENT THE WAY CAME FROM. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WE SHOULD RESPECT THE NATION AND ITS RESOURCES. PEOPLE BE WRITING :- ARE WE REALLY INDEPENDENT ?YES , DUMBASS THATS WHY U CAN  SAY A PERSON-&quot;APNE KAAM SE KAAM RAKH NA&quot;.THATS IT.

OMG I am fan now!
Srks comic timing. He shud be a stand up artist.

I am not Indian but I respect this guy a lot

He is most popular actor in bangladesh. 🇧🇩 Srk is romantic king.
Srk️
I could listen to him talk for hours, his voice is so mesmerizing 

Your sqeech is immaculately inspring.

Why people like to be called poor once they achieve huge success , I think everyone wants their story to make exceptional and its the poorness which make it  easier .It means poor people have the right beginning to make a great exceptional stroy.

He is just so amazing ️️️️
That&#39;s why he called badshah king of everyone&#39;s heart not only because of his romantic nature as well as his intelligent behaviour

Hes styly is awesome my fv always.....

Fav actor srk idol srk
Srk is really a great speaker. ️

Respected, sharukhan he has great personality and intelligent person.

You should learn something from him .

His age is 56 but he still looks like young people.it&#39;s  great !

Sense of humour  king

Just love the way this man speaks ️

Mom asked, &quot;Son, when did you learn to drive&quot; ... why are they all laughing? Madness

This is Kisna!
&#39;Sown his wild oats&#39; , goshhh can&#39;t get enough of your English man

The best lover and actor on screen and best speaker off screen. ️️️

No one is so intelligent, thoughtful and lovable as shah rukh khan is. 

Grandfather is a traitor and joined hands with the British against INA

Happy Birthday SRK️️️
I made a tradition in 2020 to re -watch this once every 6 months. Still here. Amaziiiiinggggg!!!!

<a href="">12:30</a>

What an incredible notion!Reminds me of another : &quot;to live is to love&quot;Great speech made me smile, believe and hope!Admirable persona! King khan indeed.

Saw this again on SRK&#39;s birthday

My whole teenage and adult life I never appreciated him as actor,but I m getting to know this man and as a person he is a gem

Phoenix SRK.rise and shine.

Intellectual speech with sense of humor by the biggest moviestar in the world 

Legend ️
He is really amazing person, and he is loved in all over the world.

Focus on your son first. understood Says he takes drugs without eating rice. You do not cook rice at home?
&lt;3

my heart is weak
The warm and wisdom in his Voice, what an elegance. I have watched this entire Ted Talk four times 

Wow. TED talks are promoting people with links to drug cases. Is it that you do whatever to be rich and you be promoted like this. What message was this anyway?? Please have a look at people’s backgrounds before spoiling TED Talks inspirational talks and deserving people. Shame on this guy to bluff so much..

It&#39;s extremely sad to see him visit a jail &amp; that too not for his own mistakes. He bowed to no one all his life but he was forced to this time due to his son&#39;s mistakes. Wish SRK &amp; his family is out of this mess soon!

Anybody after Aryan Khan case   ??
Good movie Star 
2021

I knew shah rukh was a profound person, and still this managed to surprise me. My god! What a man and what a speech.

Irony is the Man who is preaching my country my country for all the positive reason possible here, today has to fight with the system and higher authority of the same country for being popular and not coming in term of their ideology and moreover to promote love rather falling for war raging agenda.

Lol

We love Shah Rukh Khan
Love you Shahrukh Bhai, what a speech 

Actors can express themselves so wisely when they are not interviewed by pinkvilla

One like for SRK

if you want to learn english ,repeat this speech again and again thank me later!

Who is watching this ever since, he got framed by the opportunist political party whose main intention is to divert public attention via his son Aryan&#39;s arrest. Shame on the illiterates who are running the largest democracy of the world and taking the country southwards in all respects. 

The Best

If u didn&#39;t love n enjoy this Ted talk 

I like his humor.

Shahruk you are too good I love you

Sometimes children slip a bit that doesn’t mean parenting is wrong. No parent will ever teach their kids to take drugs. If we practice whatever he is speaking, trust me the world would be a much much better place to live in. Think of a world full of love, compassion, togetherness. Just imagine. No violence, no hard feelings, no hate for any religion or groups. Just pure and simple love. Love that will bind us.

I Love you SRK you are pride of India

i lovee srk !! but the speech here is kinda meaningless, just a mumble, jumble of words.

I don&#39;t know why people in my nation hate him so much.He is such an amazing person.

Wow 
If SRK doesn&#39;t born we wouldn&#39;t feel romance in movies.

Oh God... 
Who&#39;s here after  his son&#39;s  drug involvement???

You love him or hate him but no one can deny that he is the wittiest bollywood star and an Excellent speaker.

First and most probably the last 

And we all know why he is The SRK

Beautiful 
SRK️️‍
We&#39;re very proud of Shah Rukh Khan. From India🇮🇳

His Son screwed him 
Lag gayi son drug addict 
Send supports to this man, now, the extremist modi BJP , RSS created a fake case against his young son, who had no drugs on him or in him, will not set bail or released him ! Witch hunt is going on against BW artists, in India !

I&#39;m feeling sad for him

Whenever I got anxiety or stress due to hardwork I came here and watch this video it&#39;s is completely amazing loveeeee uhhhh love guru and our motivational Guru ️

Proud to have SRK in India. I love the way he is and his humbleness. SRK really inspires and admire me a lot.

We love you SRK️
Let&#39;s perform without the drugs shall we?

Who&#39;s here after Aryan Khan arrest?

recommended to me after aryan khan arrest

This man is diffent what he is real..

His son ARYANKHAN catch by NCB IN DRUG PARY...

Shah Rukh Khan is the only Indian who has been awarded Unesco Pyramide con Marni award for his charity work.

<a href="">10:36</a>

Supreme levels of confidence was projected through excellent command over the language. Sheer hard work, focus &amp; consecration towards the profession made him super star

This is the man who proved that if you dreams it you can do it.

&quot;He is the most loved celebrity in Universe, period .&quot;

confusing speech..no conclusion
I love you 
I love you srk...... Baadshah.. King. ..
This man lost everything in young age family mom dad his sister got depression then started his career by serial bollywood debut by other rejected movies he never give up life true inspiration shahrukh khan sir

Salmon khen be like: phutpath pe mil tu

Great Charisma Telling stories of dead parents with a positive attitude and audience are laughing.

It feels bad when same person does Pan masala add and Fair and handsome add.

Great stuff. I watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the stock market but haven&#39;t made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and I do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands.

SIMPLY OBSOLETE.

CSK vs KKR 2012
What a presentation

Love ️ love ️ love ️ Shahrukh 
Didn’t like much
All hail to king srk.

The man he is the Pride of India 🇮🇳️

Please suggest me how i improve my speaking skill...?

A good actor as well as a good public speaker

Actually, he is the biggest brand ambassador of India to the world.

Can anyone be this much Charismatic,witty,intelligent and smart? Amazing...India should feel proud of him..such a Huge Star

It&#39;s like poetry and I&#39;m jealous of him

Aahh!!!The Shahrukh Khan 
BMW i8 ️
We get Nothing in this life without struggle..this man got what he really deserves..

Long dance long dance.......long d.n..
I am really mesmerised by his englishAwsm guy

This is the best speech I ever heard from an actor.

<a href="">10:30</a>

Whoever wrote his speech is absolutely brilliant.

Bruh. Too good to be true.

A complete Legend!!
SRK is true philosopher!

Yes, He is the most (not one of the) perfect public personality of all time this country has ever produced. You should appreciate him rather than hating him and making shity comparisons with other actors who are nowhere close of him

lungi dance, lungi dance, lungi dance, lungi dance woooo fall fall fall deeper for just him
Those stupid people who think that Priyanka has made India proud see this interview Priyanka doesn&#39;t even have 1  billion fans whereas srk has around 3.5 billion fans which makes him the biggest celebrity on earth

Awesome person

Great way to be a simple SHAHRUKH, hats off too you for always being this way.

What a great speaker he is!

its wrong to be self obsessed like him

Bhut bdhiya bhai
Gradually I&#39;ve begun to decipher his intentions right after series of attempts to watch. Literally It sounds like poetry.

I love this man very much from Morocco he is very smart and intelligent and very popular man he is the biggest superstar in the world he learn us how to be successful person in this world he is a great man I love him 

I am a proud fan of this man.

Baadsah Oh Baadsah ️
Only beggar of my heart&#39;s of love mack  them&#39;s God of love for them&#39;s &quot; are never commercial beneficial &quot; must missing direct me iff I needed  more extra whaatt for mee than him&#39;s ?? Is hide worry behind&#39;s sorry for money&#39;s.  Is never TRP or trape data&#39;s.

Who are here after 4 years

He is the one of the best speaker in the world

I pray that you remain happy with your family.
I pray for my father because Allah provides me with everything in heaven.
here gyan zaado...or sell guthaka pan masala in the market...had h year....some money for money....
I think sir you are a confidence man of the world.

Omgggggg he rehearsed his entired fucking speech he probably had it written by some expert , and he mugged it up like a good actor he is , such a fucking waste of Ted talk ,no originality to this at all

I love SRK and have enjoyed many of his movies, but this talk was a cringe-fest. The talk-material was very pretentious and incoherent. Clearly he spent a lot of time memorizing all the &#39;poetic&#39; lines and it felt like he was just reciting textbook literature out of memory. I still can&#39;t tell what exactly was the message for &#39;future-me&#39;. This kind of prose makes for good reading, not speaking. If you&#39;d like to feel more connected to the real human-being that SRK is, watch his talk with David Letterman. That&#39;s so much better than this &#39;philosopher/poet&#39; version he&#39;s trying to awkwardly portray.

<b>Indians</b> assemble
That&#39;s why you are a real king, love you man from Bangladesh &lt;3

Love you SRK king of romance

Inspiration

He is the king of romance ️️️

Omg witty

powerful one better than success

Love you SRK ️
Srk
SRK I love you. You are my super star 

He is an amazing speaker...

The conclusion shahrukh Khan = humanity

I have appreciation for his spirit of trying to spread love. But barely do I think he knows half the time what he is talking about. Sue me.

Sharuk Khan op in the chat

Hope.more people like him in my country

Apple was just an fruit before

Man, this is the best TED talk I&#39;ve ever seen

His intellect and charm are unmatched

Telling his tragic moments with a humor - just SRK Things 

Voice️️️️️
Lots of love Shahrukh to all of you
As a Muslim, u should say as-salamualaikum..to all

Great

Boycott bollywood

This man right here is the reason why my taste in man is so rich!

King for a reason, Amazing public speaker.

SRK is the kingg 

Lesbian is the capital of Portugal &gt;&lt;

What an amazing sense of humor and what a good fluency in English🇮🇳🇮🇳

I can watch this any number of times. It is so refreshing to listen to SRK. His wit and humour are unmatched. 

I  BOLLYWOOD  SRK 
So full of himself that it seems so very crass He needs to learn from Mathew McConaughey. Why does this guy always make these self proclamations of greatness and always a sob story about his parents. Very crass &amp; cheap. Lacks class. Other than talking about himself Shahrukh Khan has nothing intelligent or interesting to say

&#39;Humanity is like an aging movie star&#39;-SRK

This has to be the weakest SRK speech, maybe he did that intentionally to support,what he is trying to speak, that is do not really care about anything  and do what you want to do

Live ok guys it&#39;s not you it&#39;s me think about

Well.. someone made use of the thesaurus !!!

Great speech sir.... u always motivated us by giving such speeches...

&quot;In it&#39;s immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter, who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams, should become it&#39;s king of romance.&quot; g o o s e b u m p s 

where he said the one who used to ugly become the king of bollywood anybody know tell me

&#39;I belongs to poor family &quot;&quot;I don&#39;t have job and money &quot;&quot;I have to handle my family &quot;&quot;but YouTube is not giving me subscriber and views &quot;&quot;ya my condition is worse than other.

Who is here for just SRK

Love you srk
She is not a star, the world is mine.
You are 1 in a Billion !!! You are reason behind every youngster Dream in get into Bollywood !!!

Those guys don&#39;t know who they&#39;re listening to.

SRK is not good for India 

I really think I&#39;m the 8th million view....

srk damm i have never seen this speech hats off.. srk i can&#39;t imagine that the speech I love ...u srk.. u inspired a lot of people. and I want to become like srk one day

A beautifull human been 

Love you to max SRK️
Such a mindful person. He speaks with so much dedication and hopefulness. Shahrukh has got such a charming personality. His presence of mind, an intellectual person with so much awareness. He really is a great human being. All my love to SRK God bless him and always keep him and his family happy.

You are the perfect soul in the perfect place in the perfect time. Universe takes you for give Love around all the world 

very good

&quot;The bottom line is, there&#39;s no any country better than india&quot; - Shah Rukh Khan ️

He is first person to become famous in a whole world in hero

Shahrukh Khan, you beauty! Love you to the moon and back. 

# Im last of the 

Love you, SRK.

U are lagend love from kashmir

If shah Rukh khan wouldn&#39;t have been an actor, he would have been the best stand up comic in the world.

Till now &quot; WORLDS BIGGEST SUPERSTAR &quot; proud to be indian actor ️️️️️️
The Only Actor talks in Ted talks in India&#39;.. Sharukh Khan always proud India&#39; in the world..I think everyone proud him..️

This men is a legend

damn shah rukh khan are my favorite bollywood actor since i was little

It was very amazing speech. He told us the key of life &#39;Love&#39;.

Love you all
He took sanskrit to an international platform , many would have not done it

Such a big star , whole world loves him, but still in India some people hate him because of his religion , forgotting everything he has done for the country , i could see the pain in him when he said about internet.

Very well done

<a href="">9:02</a> pure magic

Who&#39;s watching in 2021?

Hyderabad film city

Good one

What so funny  thanks for telling ur story?

Call Karan Johar on aap ki Adalat

Couldnt write better ???

A true rich man.

Any SRKians here in 2021?

Islamic people are very different - they have 2 worlds in their brain - one likes to live in the outer world. What should they say and do - they are special in talking about non-Muslims - but the 2nd side of the brain is of Islam - these are the logs of Islam, Quran, Shariat. They are slaves, they are very harsh, their treatment is harsh Hindutvaavaadi hai-RSSvaale-these two-Islamic, Hindus are similar-the food to eat is different-and the teeth to be shown are different-they are very cruel about religion The fanaticism of these two is very dangerous like the country and the world, their values ​​are not what they appear to be, and their ranks are filled with religion, - India. You are telling the media people to pay attention to the Hindi national language, English is understood by 1% of the people in India.
what an absolutely marvelous man. love him forever and ever.

Thank you Shah Rukh Khan for representing India in such an amazing way. Definitely one of my favourite ted talks

im in love with his presentation his way of delivering both his sucess and failures his content everything was just beyond my vocab hatsoff srk

Haters of him can&#39;t even understand the words on the speech he is given

Pround the be Indian....SRK bhai....actually what he said really touched my bottom of heart,  really cool...

I can clearly say that why do people listen to this man cause illiteracy towards great knowledge to ancient Indian philosophy

Srk is now a philosopher than that of an actor

Sera

Shahrukh Khan
The legend of world

When you understand shahrukh..you stop watching his movies and start listening his speeches.

Favourite superstar
Ok. This is one of the most elegant ted talks ever. And the love he has for his motherland makes each one of us love the country even more .

Inspirational srk

The verdant certification laterally refuse because plain constitutively cause opposite a abrasive mailbox. tightfisted, public push

The sticky racing coronally whistle because supply postsynaptically measure qua a unequal stop. fine, wholesale chest

Sah raukh Khan Ted talk would be like me

Great Human Being 
He is a perfect man what a speech

Great

I can&#39;t believe people thought srk was ugly back in the days damn well that didn&#39;t age well at all
