Times when Batista left working out

How does he do this?  make his body turn into brass and become immune to any type of weapon or blade?  this guy was very sinister!😯

They couldn’t come up with a better name than Brass Body? Like anything would be better than that. Even Metal Body would be better than brass lol

I really thought he was going to be set on fire

<a href="">0:17</a> this is meme

Pure dex vs pure strength
If only Batista had been cast to play Conan!!!

batista wwe
The Asian dude fighting Batista could literally play gutz.

THIS MOVIE IS VERY GOOD I GIVE IT 10 OUT OF 10
As much as I adore Dave Bautista, I wish him the best of health💞
The animal batista at his best...first1 he killed with a batistabomb...cool 💥 love👍👌👏💪

Bond Henchman Mr. Hinx vs Bond Henchman Yao

Rickden = Why won&#39;t you DIE ? ? ?Sen Batista = WWE SON !

How is the film titled? Please.
What is the title of the movie?
loved this movie so much dave bautista did so good he was a monster till he got defeated

Keeeee blade

How the heck did this movie get Russell crowe 🤣

Before Drax joined the Guardians......

The action scenes were great but the story made no sense

Dave Dave Dave hurry up

A man whose body is essentially immune to blades versus someone who relies completely on blades to kill; he should have just ran.

Get em boy🕹🥋
Next

Oscar ability

When drax the destroyer was iron fist
batistabomb

..golden khaki..
X Blade: aggressively hitting.Drax: HURTS....... I have sensitive nipples.

nice video
Nanomachines son
This is the real iron fist

Man, Batista needs to make more bad guy roles like this one

Copy that our history

Brasstista

Whatever Brass Body go fetch my car

Man marvel really buffed drax he can turn into brass man

he is using airbag sensors

In India karna will remember
This movie was freaking great but the second one was 50/50 for meI should def rewatch both movies. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen them.

Man Of Brass, not of Steel, like Superman.😤

Rza accidently made colossus.

The music in this scene made it twice as good!

What is the name of this movie
Lord friza

Brass boi vs Wimp with knives

Now ik why they chose him as drax or how ever u call him

If he&#39;s iron fist then What&#39;s about his wife🙄🙄

Ok but u see it as golden body not iron

This was a better mortal combat movie than the one we just got.

Njay, kyk real is the film in our time 😀👍👍👍
What is this the legend of Zelda why so many pots.

Thank god I didn’t see this god awful movie back in 2012 I hate movies where like this were the guy can’t be hurt absolute rubbish

They might as well add him into MK11🤣

So i see johnny tran just gave up racing

Wolverine vs Colossus...

Wow that&#39;s some bad cgi... 😂😂

So Batista wins again ig

Whenever the veggie eaters hate bamby eaters

all these years and nobody commented on how brass body BATISTA BOMBED A GUY TO DEATH

Its late but the movie good?

heyyy it&#39;s the guy from Fast and Furious

When Indians get into hollywood

I love the God of War fight music

I never thought batista is xmen

This looks dope

Who ripped the kids throat. Dude must have been moving so slow I couldn&#39;t see him

Drax!

wow basista is so cool they made him into a real thing

Johnny Tran

I actually love this movie

This only makes me realise the wasted potential Drax had.

&quot;That wrestler disrespected my family,  I had Feds in my house&quot;...

Bane!

man like dave batista uno
The truth is... I am Brass Man!

if only this is the bautista who fought zeus

Legend has it drax is in this video before he came q destroyer....but he must&#39;ve stood still the entire video😫

Is that Draxx? From gotg

“Iron hands vs golden batista”.
Where to watch more

Batista bomb XD

I love how right at the start x-blade does two big kicks to his chest and Brass barely even moves with a &#39;really?&#39; look on his face

Gotta love literal plot armor.
Dude, I bet he&#39;s got more that a 100 grand under the hood of that car

He should play Doc Savage

the gym teacher when they join your team:

Ah.  The new Mortal Kombat protagonist stole his powers from this guy.  This scene is way better then anything from mk2021 though.

Johnny tran got worked over pretty good 😆

Batista would&#39;ve took them hits either way he dont need to act like it didn&#39;t hurt bc it didn&#39;t lmao

nothing like a fair fight

Its one of Cole Youngs ancestors

did he die?
Why you gotta do Jin so dirty Drax?
I&#39;m the only one who thought of this while watching MK 2021

When you try to kill the rammus late game as ad assasins

Drax, is that you?

&quot;Dave Batista,&quot; Masive!!

Wtf is this.... and how have i not heard about it

It&#39;s golden colossus s solo movie
this was supposed to be an action comedy right lol

Batista bomb

I was wondering why the dude looked so similar to Drax when he became bronze. now I know why

Marvel saw this film and knew he&#39;d be a perfect Drax. They were right.

Bautista is perfect for Sparky Sparky Boom Man

that color of haki 🤣🤣🤣

Oh, the innocent crockery...

Why&#39;s this movie framed so horribly?

batista bumbum

cole young copied the swag

<a href="">1:38</a> SHIRT RIPPER

drax is in every movie sometimes we can see him and sometimes he stands so incredibly still we can&#39;t see him

F

Those people dont know the first rule of the dark souls... if you cant hurt the boss just fucing run

That’s how we starting? Sheeeeeeeeeeesh

Brass Draxx is <b>Braxx.</b>

I used to have the gloc 9 in the thumbnail ampota
The best thing to come from this is the rest of Bautista&#39;s career afterward.

gotta love the valve stock metal clang sounds

Dude smile like he is waiting to get fk

this is so stupid i love it

eye
Is he even the bad guy? That what only kid says lol

hes got civics with spoon engines

HI

what is wrong with the blood sprut

Drax means business
damn batista
batista vs collosus

take a shot everytime theres a whoosh and a whip sound effect.

Only run away!

i start remember when drax said he can take iron man shot i think he can

High level armament Haki ah
Proof Macgruber trained Bautista.

haki

<a href="">0:34</a> golden head  <a href="">0:38</a> changed wth
That Batista bomb was no joke.

i think Batista&#39;s chest is kinda floppy

What’s the counter to an impervious foe?<i>Shingles</i>

1.1 thousand or more comment
Drax?

Deppresion son it strengthens against mental trauma

So this is what those wuxia novels mean when they say cultivating the brass body.

From Gold.
High level Haki vu
ZA WARRRRRDOOOOOOOO

<a href="">0:23</a> the joke didn&#39;t go over his head

this should be dubbed the brazen animal brassista

Garbage movie

Its batista

¡Tank power!
THANOSSSSS!

He just Rambo&#39;d his neck lmao

C3PO really committed to a glowup, damn

<b>context</b>

Chinese action movies really are something else

10 years ago, if you&#39;d told me that Dave Batista was gonna be one of Hollywood&#39;s most recognizable action star, I&#39;d have asked who sold you your weed.I&#39;m glad I was wrong.

<a href="">0:26</a> mans just got an irl wall bounce combo lol

So he is like a tackier colossus

Looks like devil fruit powers
WHY IS GAMORA??!

His head looks like golden experience
Ultimate example of rock vs scissors

I think that's a Baptist, right?
Good man or iron man

I&#39;m gonna tell my kids that this was iron man

fun fact: that brass colored skin that appears from time to time is actually batista.

i like how he just ripped his throat out and it had a fog of blood that came out

How tf bautista has haki?

I feel like davs batistas only direction was to let them punch you a few times then slam the stunt doubles into some stuff

It&#39;s white luke cage

Well rocket was lying. “His kind takes everything literal.”He literally wasn’t lying when he said he would kill his son

Man I loved this movie so much I&#39;m gonna watch it

Is that a terminator?

Upon quickly sawing the thumbnail, i though this was a very elaborate cosplay of DIO&#39;s The World

I can&#39;t decide if I want to make a GotG joke or a Metal Gear Rising joke... this is tough, man.

WHY IS GAMORA

Shh, no one tell the writers how much softer than steel brass is

I hated this movie then and I hate it  now

Hey , triple h come see it&#39;s him &quot;Batista&quot;

What&#39;s the idea behind Brass Body&#39;s ability? Why brass in particular?

Warframe Rhino

so he becomes on of the weakest meltals in history but yet nobody can break him yet wait till hulk hears about this lol

Is this the cheap version of cyclops?

Brutal

Armstrong in real life.

What's the movie called?
Blades vs metal dosent go all that well for the blade

Armament haki is somethin else.

yo this video is sick

@ no point during this pretty ridiculous movie did I ever think he was going to become one of my favorite actors 2 years later, but you did Dave you did.

<a href="">0:29</a> MY GOD, ITS THE BATISTA BOMB!

<a href="">0:03</a> Hmmm I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve heard that sound before somewhere

Who were they fighting? I couldn&#39;t see the man they were all fighting...

Dude look like golden freeza from dragon ball

Fun fact, there were no special effects in this scene. That&#39;s just standard Bautista stuff.

The first I see of this movie is Batista ripping a kids throat out. Rad.

I wish they can’t see the big guy. Why? “Drax” gonna tell you everything.😏

Did you learn to pull out Adam's apples from Gordon?
<b>weapons wont work against him</b>Maybe I&#39;ll try hand...

Wtf he becomes a dundie?

What is the title of the movie?
this movie sucks
He was like, having the armament haki.. 🤣 😂

Ask
I really want to make a Jojo&#39;s reference

sorry its a dumb movie when you make someone that op and they still try and fight

Batista is half american half filipino right?

Every second of this movie feels like satire

Ahh yes another day another weird youtube recommendation.

Why is nobody else talking about MCJin

Drax?

This film appeared which is one hour long, why are films always short
Can we just say how bad this movie was😂

I think the name film is hall of judge

Brass body character is Wwe wrestlers Batista I think.

Draxx !! is that you ?

I know it its batista the wwe wrestler thats why

I think i know this guy with the iron fists

In general, everything is clear, but I still have one question: what are all these 10,000 clay pots doing there?
Johnny Trans vs Drax
H uyjjcnr
Is this drax from guardians of the galaxy

I never narc&#39;d on nobody!

Brass Body?That&#39;s Batista with his Batista tattoos doing Batista Bombs

All those pots. Link would be proud

&quot;no weapons seem to hurt this guy let me punch him with my unprotected fist and try to fight him hand to hand&quot;

So this is where they got the idea of luke cage Netflix series

Copy from Luke cage

,,,Drax?

what its batista

johnny tran lookin different here
Without his V-tec he is nothing

Too much zoom in close up.
he had gold on his chest

I&#39;ll do you one better! Why is Gamora?

Yellow drax

Iron shirt))) I watched it, I'll watch Quentin's version later
Batista movie so nice
&#39;_:-

So this what drax has been doing in the side

My man doing the &quot;dirt&quot; minecraft sound at <a href="">0:58</a>

X-blade &amp; friends: *throws shurikens and saw the enemy has literally impenetrable skin*Proceeds in close-quarter combat

Lol,he is MC Jin

Wow batista

Use thunder since he is made of iron. Crazy to fight without tactics and strategy.

This movie had so much wasted potential

Phantom Troupe vs Meruem in a nutshell

Batista on WWE

Woah 😲 he has an armament haki

NANOMACHINES, SON!

This movie was hard af

I want him to be bane for the DC Movies

See ! Drax may not be invisible but he is invincible 😉😉😁

After the weapon breaking why punch him loll????

Dana White kah?

Nanomachines son.
Rip hippop man
Drax?

love how they had the batista bomb 😂

If the do wwe was bad here it is disgusting
Haki

This guy is had a paramecia power devil fruit.

reminds me of tessai from ninja scroll

Can we PLEASE say a few words about how Zen-Yi&#39;s boy was Ride or Die to the very end???  Respect.

<b>Johnny Tran Meets Luke Hobbs</b>

So he like Armstrong?

Guy that can take blades, punches, water, kicks and has super strength: &quot;Oh no, a small roof, you totally got me now, oh no&quot;.

He has a devil fruit

Like honestly wrestlers should just stay in these roles. Its where they&#39;re best

Trap him, apply heat, shiny new door knobs for all the homes in the area.

Proof of haki

I’m watching this film on my laptop right now, and then an advertisement came out on Android))) It’s absolutely fantastic))) It’s called: Iron Fist (2012)
So basically he’s the armored titan...or has armament haki got it

<b>Sees his throat ripped</b> dang! that was horrible &amp; violent. He should have ripped his jaw out, to make even better &amp; with moar violence

Nanomachines son!
Mood

Dead vs The evil nephew from karate kid

Thank goodness Peter Rasputin is a teddy bear at heart. Amirite?

So David Batista is gonna be the live action sparky sparky boom man right

Why are all of you making jokes abot this child murder killing spree movie

Why does the brass spark and not scratch when hit with hardened steel? Brass is pretty soft comparatively

Is this the comedy?

Link would be jealous

:o

Lol...fake Colossus...but gold!

In the wise words of TFS Vegeta: wow what a rip off!

so basically he&#39;s Colossus, but evil.

Dave &#39;Brass&#39;tusta ,huh

Dam, spikes doesn&#39;t work. .<b>throws water</b>

Looks like the Armored Titan just sayin 😂

And thats the first armament haki user Batistaa!!!

This movie was so bad lol

Uhh hello?? What are they fighting against??? Literally just 3 adult Asian males flying around for 2 minutes.

Ah batista
So a hedgehog versus deax, amazing
That one guy just broke his sword on his head and exposed the brass. Why in the world would he punch him after that???

Fouseytube when boxing:0:38

dislikes are from t seris

I started taking Bautista seriously as an actor once I saw his short film he did for Blade runner.

<a href="">0:31</a> Bautista bomb.

I don&#39;t know what I just watched but I&#39;m sure is the worst  shity movie ever created

This reminds me of Haki one piece

Who are  they fighting against ?

i&#39;m still wondering how he got tatooed

Without context it looks like xblade is the good guy

Yeah, use piercing and slashing weapons against armor.😐

The guy batista is fighting the one that try the knifes is the same guy that played the robot samurai in robocop 3

Best character in the movie so dumb how he lost to the blacksmith. But its the blacksmiths movie so it had to happen

Is this Za Warudo?

Oh wow. I forgot Batista was in this movie. Now it makes sense why they asked him to be in guardian of the galaxy. He is great.

Now...that.....is.....acting!

When Jhonny Tran was pissed because Drax stole his bike

sorry but he&#39;s forever Drax.  nothing can change that now.

If he turns to brass if something harms him then how did he get his tatoos

This movie was awful

I wonder what killed them because I saw nothing..

OH YEAH MY PARENTS KANE KEKE REMEMBER THIS MOVIE ACTION PACK

and he did the batista bomb on here

<a href="">2:04</a> <b>SHIZAAAAAA...!!!</b>

*Everything else&#39;s fine, but how the hell did Drax change his colour?Man!

Hollywood and Bollywood are doing their part to keep the clay pots industry booming in the 21st century.

its like haki

Wait hold I just noticed was that Jin the Asian rapper who neck he ripped?

Is that mcjin at the start lol damn the algorithm

Nanomachines, son!
Was that Jin in the beginning? The irony of an MC getting his vocals destroyed. Get it? His vocals....?

trying to punch when sword fails to damage!

You can infact turn your body into iron but it will take 20 years . It is in ancient tibetan script

If you ask me they need Logain

China's Bata Tu coin
Give him a S2000! He is gonna win!

Golden Frieza
Drax with the hax

gold freezer

wow didn&#39;t know he can turn into super Saiyan

Never saw this. Looks kinda bad. Eeesh..

The owner of the wine shop watching: 👁💧👄💧👁

There is no shame in running

I want back the money I didn’t pay for watching that mess.

Yes batista
I didn't know Draxx had those powers😱👈😂
Communist china makes terrible movies... But alot of production value..

Idk why but he&#39;s a perfect combustion man cast

Could have played collossus in xmen. Thats how he shouldve been able change to himan form. Just needed to work on the accent

And in ours, what is the name of the film?
so he dies after that?

Batista

Looks like they took the &quot;Doc Savage Man of Bronze&quot; one liner litteraly.

Gee. What a brasshole

<a href="">0:28</a> THE BATISTA BOMB !!!

Like a movie called
Ever think he looked at being Drax as a step down? 😂

What's the title of the movie? It's all in English. Anyone seen it?
What movie is this please?
When throwing people actually kills them and you kill them when you have them

Well, that's crap
the secret was on his shoulder .. Philippines flag ... haahahhaha

That character design was pretty damn dope 👌🏾

Brass is not that tuff!!! 🤔

This is the Godfist LeeSin skin that I want.

Why is X blade?

&quot;Nanobrasschines son&quot;
Johnny Tran had no chance

I am grooottt
He had to Batista Bomb them all

Batista had an incredible physique at his prime.

<b>BRASSTISTA</b>

<a href="">0:00</a> omg... is that... jin??? LOL!

He needs to play a real life Broly in the DBZ franchise

Op batista, draxx

Still dope
I&#39;ve watched this movie before, too bad draxx is the bad guy here

Never wouldve fought him. Nope

My 10 year old self vs my abusive step father

Bautista bomb😂

Y&#39;all talking about drax and i couldn&#39;t even see him.smh

Of all the wrestlers I expected batista to be the last one to have a successful acting career. It&#39;s funny how he&#39;s better than John Cena

Cool movie I watched a long time ago
<a href="">0:11</a> I didn&#39;t see anything :D, Why X-Blade attack ??

Batista is there

This looks like a snickers commercial but its you when your not hungry.

He is Batista

Where&#39;s brass body? I didn&#39;t see anyone

You need Nitric Acid to defeat this guy

Ytugkiyoyoy😭😱6tutitigigog
Iron Man, meet Brass Man

Batista is a physcopath.

Hey there is a batista I think 🤔

<a href="">1:08</a> COQUINA CLUTCH, HE&#39;S GOT IT LOCKED IN HE&#39;S GOT THE COQUINA CLUTCH LOCKED IN ON BATISTA!

I think Bautista would’ve made an amazing Bane

<a href="">0:17</a> &quot;Bonk...Bonk...Bonk&quot;

I cant believe Drax killed Rich Brian.

The poor doggie had to suffer and watch dis XD

2x is normal speed. Try it.

Everyone punching Me . Going to future take a Barret 50bmg and penetrate him Because it&#39;s brass not titanium Brass = gold density

If Colossus could go super Saiyan

This is Batista

I didn&#39;t know Drax is tough

&quot;Blade didn&#39;t work? Well gotta try something so I guess I&#39;ll punch his face.....&quot;Narrator: &quot;it did not work&quot;

Mantis : Oh that&#39;s a nice body

batista man

The character is BATISTA

VISIT MY CHANNEL:@t

I think I&#39;m waiting for a dwayne johnson and Batista movie

Yang Se-hyung at first?
well damn that was a intro

Pre botox Batista &gt; Botox Drax Batista

Wait his body turns to brass when he’s attacked. But they hit him with a steel blade. Steel is harder than brass but it broke. But some how Iron Hands was able to smash him into pieces. I don’t get it.

Isn&#39;t brass a pretty soft metal?

The original &quot;Nanomachines , son! &quot;

if he went ninja assassin he would have stood a chance

He did his smack down <a href="">0:30</a>

Batista

Wait, so this dude is using haki?

w... where do the spikes go when they retract?

the thumbnail looks like golden frieza

Don't break the jar and fight outside.
Oh its batista

I remember seeing this movie in theaters but dear lord I don’t remember it lol

<a href="">0:38</a>

Dave Bautista: I consider myself a real actor who can play serious roles.Film producers: .... well, about that....

Is that randy orton from wwe ?

Just give me a magnet for a used car crane
Nanomachines son.
Bioshock anyone?

Wasn&#39;t he in wwe

Haki

Very good steel should be able to cut through brass actually. Brass is super brittle.

he use a haki !!

It&#39;s Drax- The Destroyer from &#39;Guardians of The galaxy &#39;

Full move hd. In

Why Gomora

I belive that dude have a sensitive nipple

Batista

That’s a WWE wrestler

Watching that man punch a person whose skin was just shown to be hard enough to break his blade... might be the stupidest decision I&#39;ve ever seen a character make.

That was the fastest strip I ever seen.

Drax obtains Colossus&#39;s Power
DK vs Draxx

This dude mastered armament haki

Drax😄
Hilario Flores
Nice rip off of Ninja Scrolls

His Last words was &quot;why gamora?&quot;

I just realized that’s Bautista from WWE they made him look real Asian.

Golden Frieza?
Give this oscar a man.

Nice.But Randy Orton is better than.

You can&#39;t beat something you can&#39;t see. He&#39;s invisible.

&quot;Nano Machines son, they harden in response to physical trauma.&quot;

Thats Golden Freeza

Iron fists?Bronze body?What’s next,Balls of steel?😜

Drax went gold
Stab his eyes!!!

I never knew when you move your head it gad a sound effect

His armament haki is top tier lol

The secret is trembolone.

Nanomachines son

Thats called haki noobs.

The only Chinese KungFu movie where all the characters were speaking English

Did anybody notice that it is JJ from My Spy

Plot Twist: It&#39;s actually The Iron Fists With The Man.

Thanos waited for Brass Body to die before thanos could collect the stone.

Thanos waited for Brass Body to die before thanos could collect the stone.

After watching this again wish was an anime like Afro Samurai

Why would you attempt to rear naked choke someone made of metal?

Johnny Tran needs his s2000

Wu Tang Hand
“Why won’t you die!?” “NANOMACHINES SON!”
How did they even see him. He&#39;s invisible

Invulnerable to all weapons but the person has died shot by the wakaka police
Reminds me of a dude I fought. Tried punching his nuts, but broke my hand.

Wu Tang Clan RZA
typicl chinese movie

Blades: Ineffective:ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF ATTACK...FIRE?CRUSHING?IMMOBILIZATION?FREEZING?<b>...POTTERY!</b>

What's the name of the film?
&quot;I am the immortal iron fist weapon of kun lun&quot;

Iam sure he ate an devil fruit  from one piece

These were foreign movie producers, who made this garbage. Probably from China

This looks pretty low budget

Who is the Real Iron Man ?!

gild tesoro in one piece gold

Armour haki

Rahul Romita Rabha
Rahul Romita Rabha
Movie name please

I&#39;m gonna be honest with you chief, brass is strong than copper but it ain&#39;t stronger than steel.

This is when you don&#39;t know martial art and you act like you have super power and strength in the movie.

BRASS BODY SON, IT HARDENS IN RESPONSE TO PHYSICAL TRAUMA

Who is he fighting , I don&#39;t see him

Drax vs Ninja
Using god mode is not fair

Into the unknown

Gold man obliterates a Porcupine man

1like for Brass body vs colossus 2020

Brass the destroyer

He kinda look like fighter in wwe but idk his name

Brass body should be Luke Cage Villian think about it: Unbreakable vs Unbreakable

One day Bautista will legit become a super villain or a anti hero

<a href="">0:25</a> bloody hell, didn’t realise this was a prerelease tease of Into the Unknown.

<a href="">0:41</a> that was kind of dumb

He has armament haki

That&#39;s is batista in WWE

I wonder how he got his tattoo..

What if brassbody fights over kolossus of x men who would win?

Right 😨!!
Ad carry vs tank/bruiser, smh
Please tell me the name of the movie too.
There should have been a sequel to this B film

I don&#39;t see who they are fighting to

Still one of my favorites

Iron fist vs Luke cage

he from pure copper in our time would have passed it on metal )))

Is that Jin? Lol

<b>batistia bomb</b>

Ironfist is a wwa

One of them wwe

my last brain cells fighting off a very bad idea that I want to do.

HE LOOKS LIKE GOLDEN FREEZER

Toretto! It was you!

Haha, is that what got you into it??? Looks like Black Widow will be dusted off too.
This is basically a mortal combat movie

the animal Bautista

What movie?
Why is gamora!!!!Oh sorry wrong video

This is BATISTA?

Batista what the hell is that

these special effects did not age well

Everytime batista&#39;s body becomes brass. I hear &quot;maximum armor&quot;

MANTIS LOOK OUT!!!!!

Batista

anyone think Batista could make a good Kratos, hes already part Greek

Gold Draxx

Anyone else catch Frozen 2&#39;s &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; vibes from this music several times?

he may have iron skin like  Colossus from X-Men but I feel this takes inspiration from  Tessai the stone skin ninja of  The eight demons of  Kimon  from &#39;Ninja Scroll&#39;

Wow batista

Nano machines son!
Sparky sparky boom man
Mc Jin

Dio’s ZA WARLDO

I forgot all about this movie, now I have something good to watch this afternoon!!!!

Rather than claiming that both North and South Korea should be treated as enemies, it seems that he was worried about a pro-China and nuclear-armed Korean peninsula. In other words, it seems that he was worried about a red team Korean peninsula, but I wonder if his ability to read sentences is poor.
SO we just not gonna talk about how funny this was😂😂 <a href="">0:17</a>

Golden khaki
Batista

Chinese collosus be out here

Nanomachines son.
“I’ll do you one better!”

They forgot to target his balls

Why are their always easily breakable jugs of liquid around during fights scenes...

Its haki!!!!

Before he was Drax he was the shiny man

Any WWE fans? Sell I remember him as Batista.

It&#39;s looking like idea copied from Mahabharat karna

wow batista

Cost efecient Terminator...
hohoho let me show you the power of Golden Frieza

The next Rock

High level mastery of haki
Johnny Tran should have used his S2k against guy.

Rubbish
<b>When you master the Armament Haki</b>

If he had this ability when he took on Thanos, Thanos woudnt stand a chance. Thanos: I&#39;m Inevitable , Drax: No I&#39;m Inevitable

O my god. Batista
Him Vs The Colossus Of X Men

He did the bautista bomb on that guy

But what about Hector? He&#39;s gonna be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. On top of that, he just came into Harry&#39;s and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS and a Motec system exhaust...

May I ask the title of the film?
Sorry I clicked this monstrosity

This dude can be invisible and solid at the same time

This is me when i drink too much liquor

Absorbing man be like:

who are they fighting i don&#39;t see anyone

I want to point out that Dave Bautista said they could get a good shot of the slow-mo punch. So he told the actor to just do it for real. That&#39;s why that scene looks so cool.

Hes Batista

He&#39;s strong 💪 like hulk
Batistawwe

You can&#39;t hurt me Jack! Armstrong quote 🤣🤣🤣
This is the real iron man should be

Batista!!!!!!!

That gold haki like luffy

This was my favorite movie when I was a kid lmfao.

<b>tribal tatoo in ancient china</b>
fc wwe

Oh it’s that asian guy from fast and furious 1.

Terminator vs this guy who wins ?

Thats an incredible type of armament haki.

Which movie is this

when draxx become gold or brass?

Looks like drax was an assasin before his lost

Where is brass body, I only saw people flying around and get hurt by something I can’t see.

Drax is that you?

X-Men Colossus be d**ned.

garbage lol

He killed Jin the Mc at the beginning. Lol

That sounds fit perfectly for this golden guy how his walking

Let&#39;s see him fight Luke Cage.

Should&#39;ve used a Magnet

Completely unfazed when having knives thrown and swords swung his way... <b>blinks</b> as soon as a little water comes his way

It&#39;s batista
<a href="">0:27</a> BAAAAATTTTIIIISSSTTTAAA BOOOMMMM

C3PO been working out?
My dude just saw his man get his throat ripped out, all the while being alone.

Batista

<a href="">0:38</a>-<a href="">0:43</a>Before Luke Cage on Netflix there was Brass Body

Movie name plzz
&quot;I just broke my sword on his face.Maybe punching him will work&quot;

For some reason, I can’t see Brass Body? (only some will get the reference)

Yeah that&#39;s go fight a man made of metal in hand-to-hand combat what can possibly go wrong

Horrible editing.
now he also master invisibility

If Drax had  brass&#39;s iron body, he would totally become invisible by standing still, everybody gonna think he&#39;s just a statue

&quot;Tekkai!!&quot; yall dont know wassup

Played college ball, ya know.
Brass body uses hung gar style Kung fu
Kind of a 1 sided fight...

<a href="">1:19</a> I am drax the destroyer

NANO-MACHINES SON

When drax decide become enclave

Rogues vs. a tank.

All this time I thought he was bronze. Still Batista in this movie was badass.

ML player do you know that?
Why every other scene does the brass dissappear . Does it only appear when hit

Batista in wwe?

Golden bell?
Can someone tell what is drax doing here?

oh wait..<b>plays collective consciousness</b>there, perfect.

The gore is a joke

This movie was so terrible.

“Nanomachines, son. It hardens against physical trauma.”

I loved Batista in this.

And here I thought Golden Frieza was original.

<a href="">1:18</a> golden frezia?
nanomachines son
Makes me think, Brass Body should have been in the MCU instead.

That&#39;s how strong and powerful Drax really is supposed to be, but like all powerhouses in the MCU are nerfed.

That asian guy sure has aloy of knives on his body.And Batistas body tho, dam.

Please download link give me this movie.

It&#39;s like if the T800 went back to old time japan

What is this power ?nAnO-mAcHiNeS Son

Thats batista from wwe

The gold dude looks like &quot;the world&quot;

When an American came to China

Iron Fist is still Iron Fist even if it doesn't become hard.
Oh he&#39;s in blade runner too

Drax got a nerf

Why not just melt him down. Not only you kill him, you got medal 🏅 also for killing him. 👻

Soooooo.... iron fist?
Isn't it a Tekken movie?
<a href="">0:28</a> batista bomb
In a situation like this, ain&#39;t nothing wrong with a tactical retreat. You just ain&#39;t gonna beat the guy

You’ve heard of a Glass jaw now get ready for a BRASS jaw!

Tries to slice him with arm blades, doesn&#39;t work, so throws a jar at him...

I too am extremely humble

This Movie looks like it Sucks.

luke cage scene
So basically jax

Like wasn&#39;t a beast. ..they had to make metal lol

Drax is a sovereign with vibranium body

This  guy  reminds me of Armstrong from metal gear

Dave batista is and always will be a win

Sword didnt work, lets punch him in the jaw

Nano machines, son!
<a href="">2:00</a> A sacrifice has been made

30℅ people talk about the movie70℅ talk about Drax

So he’s pretty much colossus then, k

<a href="">1:00</a> Did I just see the guy hit him with a pot filled with Water😂

&quot;Nanomachines, son!&quot;
Anyone else read Brass Brody
Why do they not get his is a made of brass when you can see it so apparently

Aw shit. It’s Colossus and Magik’s lesser known older brother. Brass Body.

Atlas i found you
“Hey, we just watch our buddy, Sam just try to throw knives and this guy and it didn’t work”<b>”I’m gonna punch him”</b>

The yellow guy is like collosus from x men

This is the true inspiration for golden frieza

Link would be proud of Draxx collecting all those rupees

so this is just randomly getting recommended to everyone too?

What trash.
Nanomachines son
Why do you gotta bust up all that fine china??

Never let RZA make a movie again
Thank you Youtube recommendations

Bro this is a iron body not fist

Geumgangbulgo comes here
Ridiculous

Rhino Prime against mainstream bitchbois
This not iron fist This is WWE Batista the animal

What this movie name

But the questions still remains.....<b>Why is GaMoRa</b>

The first meda human

They should have gone for them nipples... gosh.

This is a visual representation of my siblings and I going up against our dad as kids.

I guess this is drax In another universe

&quot;too soon junior&quot;
Wait... Isn&#39;t he Drax???

Dave really knows how to play villians, he&#39;s an amazing actor I think he would at least get an Oscar nomination if he got a major dramatic role

<a href="">0:38</a> He thought he was invisible, so he decided not to move

When you get the god mode cheat code.

<a href="">1:17</a> armored titan

Golden drax
<a href="">0:34</a>??

So freck

When Dave barely spoken lines, and his muscles did all the talking 😂😂😂

He has the ability to stand so incredibly still, that his body becomes brass.

Batissta

Noooooo

Go Drax !!

The CGI and effects in this movie bothered me to an extent but it was a damn good film

<a href="">0:00</a> Finger on the throat means death.<a href="">0:06</a> Metaphor.

What movie? Who knows?
NANO MACHINES SON

I wonder if they got the idea for brass body from Tessai in the ninja scroll movie?

But how did the tattoo needle penetrate its body

That power bomb sent that man to heaven

Antagonist&#39;s worst mistake - Hit your opponent too far awayWhy can&#39;t you just hold onto your opponent and punch him till he dies?

Hi Drax!

Why is this in my recommendations?

<b>Kid With The Golden Arm</b>

Who else came here and thought it was marvel

“I’m not a dude, you’re a dude...”

To soon junior.
Batista with Armament Haki.

It is what happens when you give Drax an iron man suit.

<a href="">1:38</a> how I take off my clothes at the toilet after a scorching hot day outside

I can&#39;t see the enemy

It is haki but in a gold version

Ohhhhhh it&#39;s that Asian dude from Jackie Chan Drunken Master

THAT IS LIKE BADANG STORY ON ML

Is that drax?

Brass Body, Batista, Drax lmaoooo

I&#39;ll do one better, why is gamora?

No one can beat DRAX THE DESTROYER!!!

man how did I miss this movie? I think I will have to watch.

Asian Colossus

Drax when he&#39;s not invisible

this cgi takes me back to 1970

This was only just borderline ok. The second was unwatchable garbage.

He is cheating

it should of been equalizer vs john wick

Haki

nanomachines, son!!
I was so looking forward to this movie, but really disappointed when I saw it. Sure, it has loads of action but I can&#39;t put my finger on why it was disappointing.

My life is a lie I thought it was a gold body but instead it&#39;s brass, gold would be much better

Bautista nailed it😍

Brolytista

Golden frieza?!
Movie clips PIN this if you love your subscribers!

I watched this movie a long time ago, but the only thing i remember is a fat Russell crowe.

Golden Frieza looks great
Hallooooo draxx

See? Draxx wasnt lying about being able to take Ironman´s hit.

That John Cena cameo though

HAKI

To many camera cuts.
Rtx on of haki

<a href="">0:56</a> Nothing goes over his head. His reflex is too fast.

<a href="">1:15</a> I pictured Frieza going : Ohohohohohohohoooooo!
Is this movie any good? I&#39;ve been holding off since opening weekend. Should I see it?

Corny asf

Zao vs Mr. Hinx
Drax!?

What bullshit is this lol
When he saw ronan

Drax before participating in Gotg
Batista have haki power

This movie just doesn&#39;t had any story. and what can I say about the characters...... RZA&#39;s character was a stupid blacksmith and in the end he becomes the hero lmao and Dave Batista&#39;s character just pop up in middle of the movie. outta no where and becomes the main villain

(g)old colossus

WTF Why i dont know this Movie?

Well that roof certainly wasn&#39;t earthquake proof

<a href="">0:44</a>I AM BULLETPROOF!!!

<a href="">0:29</a>BASTISTA BOMB OF DEATH!!

Hi MCEU, here is your future Shang Zhi fighting against Drax.

Never heard about this movie

Gold Colossus?!?!?

ARMAMENT HAKI

<b>Brass Body.... .Does it mean Dave got a BRASS NIPPLE and TESTICLES!?</b>

This movie was directed by RZA, a member of the &#39;Wutang Clan&#39; rap group with Method Man and others in the 90&#39;s. He love old 70&#39;s martial arts films, and this is his love letter to those films.

Why is gamora ??

Drift King vs Drax
The film is ok but the lead actor is garbage ...he is so full of himself...

Whats with the background music? Is this movie from 1970?

David Michael Bautista’s FIRST Major Theatrical Motion Picture. The Year was 2012

Drax can become a human &amp; change his skin colour to golden. He is a humble chameleon with the power to stand so still that he becomes invisible.

Wtf i just saw

Ip man would have won

Wat???

batista bomb <a href="">0:29</a>
