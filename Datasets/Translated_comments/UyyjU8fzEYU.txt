Absolutely beautiful

Scientist had stroke, became hippie.  She&#39;s a great storyteller.

Amen

People with Schizoaffective etc. can attach their dreams to reality &amp; not have it be a delusion. These people with these disorders do not always have delusions or always have every symptom.

every word sounds so simple...but it is so different for us and for her.... the universe between

magnificent, thanks
She is a delight!

Beautifully makes all perfect sense

She dropped her first MDMA cap and became a pantheist.Her revelation of the spirit world are parallel to those who go clubbing in their 20&#39;s.Inspirational stuff...

Learned of this Ted Talk in Jeffrey Kripal&#39;s book &quot;The Flip&quot;.  What a testimony!

Thank you for this astoundingly wonderful description of your stroke. I am almost 6 weeks over from an ischemic stroke in the left hemphisere. Your talk renewed my faith in my ability to heal and inspired me towards a full recovery.

Nearly 2 years since my AVM. Had 10 cm in left side of brain with aneurysm. Told I would be on crutches. Never been fitter in my life (70km + of running a week). What a talk Jill!

This woman is so indicative of everything wrong with liberals

If y&#39;all haven&#39;t read her book it&#39;s of the same name and it&#39;s AWESOME! She gets more into the peacefulness and euphoria she experienced. The latter half is about how her mother helped nurse her back to health and re-learn all the things she lost when she had her stroke. She was like a baby in some ways - had to relearn the alphabet, how words worked, how sounds work, how to ask for what she wanted, like a sandwich. One of the best books ever!

I just want to know what kind of drugs she does

Brilliant!&lt;3

Amazing. Thank you ❤

Jill : So right now you can stop and think about taxes.

             How did that feel in your body?

Oprah : Not so good...
Jill : Exactly

My favorite Ted Talk ever. I&#39;ve showed it to countless people. Thank you for sharing your message Doctor ❤

On my channel I just uploaded a quality audio summary of your book!!
I have your story in my playlist for many years now and every time I listen you touch my heart and confirm my beliefs.❤

It is cool the language she use to explain her condition. Some people would just say that I died and my soul saw my body. I was in heaven.

This is life changing.  Not just for stroke survivors but for humanity. Thank you for sharing ❤

Incredibly impactful speech, very insightful.

Jill Taylor, thank you so much for sharing your story. You are a gift to humanity x

Absolutely Awesome

Can we also cover how you can search the internet and find information has disappeared. That the top 50 results just then get repeated and you cannot dig into information passed that. We’re has it gone?

This moved me to literal tears

That was sooo powerful

Interesting that she described herself like an infant when her left brain stopped working. Does this suggest that infants&#39; right brain develop first and left brain functioning develops later?  Also her right-hemisphere-only experience sounds nearly identical to those who report near death experiences. Does the left brain function decline first in trauma or death, explaining this?

Moving, funny, confronting, poetic, generous, powerful, inhabited, extraordinary. Thank you for sharing ! ❤I can't help but notice that it's 2023 and unfortunately our right hemisphere seems to be used less and less. Dramatically. Peace. And long live the right hemisphere ❣️
psychadelics experience in nutshell

Splendid!

In 2023, «medical experts» are only believed and trusted by total idiots. Right now, the doctors have us as captives. Yes, we are hostages; trust me, we are just like the hostages of terrorists. And instead of being doctors, they are now «Mafia Medicine», a quasi-gangster company.

Does her experience remind anyone else of what it&#39;s like to be on a heavy dose of K? Some interesting simularities.

Thank you for sharing!!❤

how of the moment this video is - I watched this 3 - 4 years ago when my dad suffered a stroke - I was looking for answers- which were right in front of me- in the form of this Ted talk. thank you Pam Gregory for reminding me to rewatch.❤❤❤

I choose to run the deep inner peace circuitry of the right hemisphere of my brain, as much as possible❣️ Asé 🕊️

I am Wow ed by this eye opener 💥💯👏🫶✌️❤🕊🦋
Wow so profound.  I&#39;m speechless.  I&#39;ve taught design for over 30 years and always talked about accessing the right side of the brain the spatial part and never have I heard such a profound description of my limited attempts.

Excellent advice ❤it.
Thank You so much for sharing your story🙏 much love from the Netherlands ❤️🌹💫🌈🙏

describes herself as neuro anatamist intellectual and couldnt recognise early symptoms of a stroke 🤯 glad shes not my &quot;dr&quot; 🤷‍♂️

Amazing!
The key is to finde the right balance between both hemispheres.. Once I had a dream, I was sooo deeply sad crieng bcs I couldnt finde out how to connected both sides..There is a good reason to the have both sides.. I dont think that it&#39;s about domination of 1 side 🤔

Awesome!❤
WOW!!! What a GIFT from the UNIVERSE to have an experience as this! An GOD-GIVEN-INSIGHT❤❤❤Thank you Jill!!❤❤

Thank You🎉🎉🎉
Having suffered not a stroke but aTBI as an infant and recently realizing how it&#39;s affected my life, after watching this..i question whether or not that almost dying even as an infant has given me a much different view and outlook on life than most people I&#39;ve encountered. Sure i went off to live my first almost 40 years fairly normal and extremely broken... But with certain desires that made me feel both incredibly small and ginormous at the same time. A knowing of sorts. Thank you for this talk. I now have a bit of gratitude towards my near death experience that i have no recollection of.

Magnificent 🙏🏻🥰 thank you 😊
❤❤❤  wonder full, funny, enlightening,  but, in conclusion,  we need balance of both hemispheres,,,😊 thankyou.

I&#39;ve had acid trips that felt like her stroke.

Love, gratitude and much appreciation for sharing your wisdom. Thank you ❤

Probably the most expansive talk I&#39;ve ever had the privilege of hearing. Incredibly moving, positive and enlightening. And yes, it is definitely an idea worth spreading.Thank you Jill for your courage, strength and hope ❤ 🙏

Brilliant ❤😂

This was brilliamt 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙏❤
Just beautiful!! Thank you ❤️
I cried at the end , too.So much sense.Here thanks to Pam Gregory’s recommendation.

BRILLIANT!!! One of the best emotionally insightful experiences I’ve had that highlights and reminds us all - THAT WE DO HAVE CHOICES and by deliberately choosing an expanded state of consciousness- we shape our realities and influence others in the most loving and positive way! ❤

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤from Austria with LOVE
a simple exercise I tried once is to draw a picture with your non-dominant hand (if you are right handed) this is amazing

Thank you—magnificent ❤
Wow! The best talk ever. Thank you so much!! Going to be spreading this around..... Made me cry with the beauty of this Reality.

So inspirational ❣️🙏🏼🎁One Love
Whoa, ❤

Wow. Thank you so much.

Powerful. Wow. Thanks @PamGregory for the recommendation ❤️🙏

Thank you for that information. I watched the video and I cried it was beautiful and incredibly helpful.

What part of the brain is disabled when you drink or use drugs?

Great. So we are all gonna walk around carrying Ayahuasca or Shrooms and live in the right brain hemisphere. How does that work, exactly? I mean, it’s a beautiful premise but other than the above or a stroke, I have no idea how to capture my right brain for all eternity.

Excuse me, but I have a problem and I need your help. I was able to access La La Land and now I&#39;m really confused and afraid, I don&#39;t know what to do. I feel like I&#39;m in a simulation and I feel insecure.

Somehow I feel nothing when watching. I understand every words but at the same time I don’t. I think I am an idiot

Nirvana or Nervana.

Wow ..if you read My book from 2021 you will realise that My phycosys  experience was the exact.

I sware taking and weening cocktails of antipsychotics is the same ride if you fong have psychosis to begin with…. Off label prescribing must stop. Fantastic presentation video.

Your talk has completely changed my perspective on life and death. I used to be afraid of death, but now, thanks to your insights, I feel entirely different

Don&#39;t mean to be insensitive, but I thought it&#39;s quite funny that there are certain substances out there that have similar effects. Crazy how you can switch off/on certain areas of your brain

Watching this video has helped me cope with the grief of losing my childhood cat, thank you

Every once in a while, I come back and rewatch this talk. It’s one of the most inspiring and powerful talks I’ve heard. It gives me the chills every time.

Thank you for the useful information. God bless you.❤

One Love!Always forward, never ever backward!!  ☀️☀️☀️💚💛❤️🙏🏿🙏🙏🏼
I can&#39;t believe she called work before calling 911.

You might think I&#39;m crazy, but after listening to her personal experience, I imagine a slow and confused sloth trying to mimic a human being. 😀

Actually she is correct about everything.

Its true when emotion is paired witha memory it becomes unforgetable and i fwwl like i will never forget this ted talk

Addicted to learning and watching ted talks is my newest state of being

Six weeks ago I had four ischemic strokes in a two week period after surgical procedure. Although I am still recovering none were cognitively or physically devastating. The strongest of the four strokes was in the left hemisphere. What I experienced was beautiful and I must say a gift. Love and unity of all life. I will never be the same.

The problem I have here is all the laughter from the audience. As I as an Epileptic have described this for Years but am Ignored or Laughed at, to even treated Worse by our current &#39;doctors&#39;. She has the label of being this &#39;someone&#39; but that doesn&#39;t work for us average people sadly*. So much they still need to learn themselves*

So basically she went insane.Nirvana? There is no such thing

da fuq, this lady got 2 be high off da perc lmfao real talk fr fr

one of the best TED talks

Why does this talk bring me to tears?  I started bawling uncontrollably…😭😭😭

The old Ted talks were the best.  All the newer ones, after 2015 went mostly downhill. Unfortunately.

I've seen several planets spinning around me like oranges or tennis balls, but one little ball intrigued me, it was the size of a small lemon and was at the height of my knees, I bent down to check it was the planet 🌎 I could see it, buildings the size of needlepoints, at night I saw two worms in the shape of humans, one was walking alone on an asphalt street, and the other got out of a vehicle, well dressed, the one that got down I could see his heart beating and even his veins, my little finger nail could easily fit one (1,000) of these little men, but I know one thing, one of the little men is (me) and as for the other one, I also know him, simple as that 🙇
Was it necessary to bring a real human brain?  I think... no.

HOW? But how? Why doesnt anyone tell us HOW???

I hope to meet her and talk about it. I also have the similar experience before.

I would like to meet this person in person. I also had a similar experience and would like to share it with you.
I thought she was going to say, &quot;I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother.&quot;We would have understood.

the life force In physical form

Amazing!!!
but why have someone&#39;s brain shown to the whole public like this its a bit uncomfortable ... that is why I am still septic about letting science have hold over my body

The color is the sky, the sky is the color. Mori Luo is deeply grateful. ON A VI LA UN CAN BA THE LA DAT BAN. Haraitamae Kiyometamae Kamunagara Kushimitamae Sakiwaetamae. Thank you to the five million gods.
this is exactly the feelings that gurus have when they meditate

Ive seen  this vedio many  years ago,  but I like to watch again and again.  I shared this with lot of friends.  What is important is  her mentioning of  &quot; NIRVANA&quot;. in Buddhism it has been described as  the Supreme Bliss a person can achieve.  Now she describes  it  Scientifically. Very important and interesting  presentation.  Thank you Dr. 🙏

I couldn’t understand her if I never tried LSD.

wow

If the right brain is entirely devoted to present moment experience, wouldn’t the notion that “We are brothers and sisters here to make the world a better place” simply be another story, albeit a nice one, that the left brain is telling?

After 15 yeas, still the most worthy vid on TED

She’s talking about being able to see the 5th dimension! Isn’t that wonderful!❤

Who came here after watching Lao Gao's "Right Brain Paradise" like me?
Sensational 😃
This is probably the most important video I ever saw. 12 or 13 years ago it set me on a path which completely upended my ideas about reality and brought me to study nonduality. Jill was so generous in sharing this experience cogently and honestly.

How can we move from the left brain to the right brain? That's what I want to know most.
<b>KNOW YOUR BRAIN: CORPUS CALLOSUM</b>

Wow ♥♥♥
THANK YOU FOR subtitling it in Spanish
<a href="">8:40</a> He talks about the moment when his left brain calmed down. It's the same experience as Nedojun (*^-^*)
Brilliant. Thank you

I first saw this video when I was in the hospital 11 months ago from an ischemic stroke that I suffered at 38 years old which affected my left side.i lost feeling on my left side for 6 days. Fortunately before I was discharged a month later, I was able to walk. I&#39;m still recovering and using an AFO but I&#39;m able work and do nearly everything I could do before, except run. I&#39;m hoping someday I&#39;ll be able to run again.

that was absolutely remarkable. so profound and  visual. such vivid explanation lead me to see what you see . Enlightening and peaceful. Our worlds language is in terms of frequency&#39;s and viberation. Those that focus on their mediation and straightening their inner chi will be in positions to receive the single to the enlightening path of Nirvana. Peace and love

It is the most fascinating and the best Ted talk I ever watched. I think every year I go back watching this video and it fascinates me every time.

I love it ,thank you so much dear dr. God bless you

Wow, that is all I can say. An absolute eyeopening talk.

Incredible experience, thanks for sharing... I had a similar experience with the covid. Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t as gratifying as you say, rather the opposite

Absolutely astonishing. I would like a thousand times if it could be possible. Amazing. I’m eager to get more!

I had a stroke and those who should have loved and cared for me called my slurring &quot;drunk&quot;. No one came. No one nourished me. I fought hard and alone. The world of man is horrid and cold.

I came back to this speech 4 years after I commented on this clip. It is still the best speech I&#39;ve ever heard in my lifetime.

The most inspiring and speech worth sharing in all TED

Well. This can happen in a natural way. This happens when the thoughts stop. The brain stops itself, shakes itself for a second and you can hear like a thunder.   I am not sure if it is one hemisfere maybe it is all the brain in silence and one himself being the universe.Then if you want you can come back to chattering and normal life. It can happen to special people because chattering can not be controled. Perhaps one person in one hundred thousand and just once in life. Normally people has excperiences of the emotion and fantasy that is another thing, maybe forced situations. Very nice vídeo. Thanks.

Hamid 😢
I return to this video again &amp; again. I sure wish we could ask questions!

THIS!!! Fanfreakintastic!!…&lt;&gt;~✨
Each of us has a &quot;subjective&quot; aspect to &quot;self&quot; and an &quot;objective&quot; one.  With respect, there is always a &quot;self&quot; while we are alive, even to feel peace and light and connection with everyone without boundaries.  That keeps functioning when one part of our brain doesn&#39;t function as always. What we seem to lose in these altered states of consciousness (because of a stroke, NDE) is the other side, the &quot;subjective&quot; self.  We are still able to  perceive others, the world around us, and our bodies or parts of our bodies or how we walk or move without connecting our bodies to our own being or our movement to our own agency.  Anil Seth&#39;s recent book, &quot;Being You&quot; is a clear view by a well-known neuroscientist: &quot;The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul.  It is a deeply embedded biological process, a process that underpins the sense of being alive that is the basis of all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all.  Being you is literally about your body.&quot;   Our brains are &quot;wetware&quot; (like computers have &quot;software&quot; and &quot;hardware&quot;): we are embodied and embedded selves.

Having a stroke seems to share a lot of similarities with taking hallucinogens.

She&#39;s right.  We are energy beings having a human experience. Energy is everywhere.

<a href="">8:52</a>Who or what was the witness of the silent mind

You know I am listening to this woman <a href="">7:18</a> and thinking it sounds like a near death experience...It sounds a bit like being stoned too; as in high on cannabis; with no worries, detached from reality.

Westerner   Buddhism is perfectly  nice comfortable place,  a non threaten ing place  with no uncomfortable place for a  God , a nice safe place to  think about Buddhism in for Westereners. LMAO  Meditation is about STILLING the intellect (the mental processes)  and opening  the Heart,  sorry!

Wow Amazing

Humanity needs loving reminders, everyday, that love is the cure. Thank you for sharing your idea worth sharing. 🥰*

First time I&#39;ve watched one of the earliest and most magnificent TED talks in existence... All I can imagine is creating somehow an anime-like visual illustration of how she described her experience as she went through having a stroke and being able to describe it with that level of clarity. Why anime you might wonder... Apart from how Disney does it, anime has been one of the most abundant mediums of expression I&#39;ve ever seen when it comes with telling stories for me. So yeah imagine having an anime short film being created with her story as the narrative.

I am just now reading Jill&#39;s book.  I KNOW she is correct that about the experience of the right brain. I do not fear death and it is not because I believe in any type of religion....I just know that I will cease to be trapped in this body and will go back to the collective whole.

Dying sounds so relaxing.

This video moved me.

I wonder how many people that watch this presentation actually think Jill had a “real” human brain on stage with her? The brain is basically made up of trillions of synaptic connections. The only thing that keeps it in the shape Jill had on stage with her is the skull. If/when you remove the skull you have a huge blob that would spread out like a huge pancake or bread dough. She’s probably carried that plastic brain around and given many similar talks. Just the act of her stating she had a “real” human brain in her hands got all kinds of Oohs and Ahhhs from the audience. A great way to capture the attention of an audience.

I had the same experience....it was fantastic ❤

God...this Really made me cry.Thank you.

truly a remarkable speech... Thank you so much..

&quot;...we are here to make our world a better place.&quot;  Do we ALL agree what &quot;a better place&quot; means?  Are there those who would impose THEIR vision on what a better world would be on the rest of us?  There should not be.  I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement.  (IMO), this statement is the first step on the road to totalitarianism.  (IMO), a better statement would have been &quot;...we are here to make OURSELVES better&quot;.  There is only ONE race:  Human.  There is only ONE minority:  The Individual.

Amazing 😍
Finally some one gets it I had a stroke in the er and as I’m close to death I felt the relief of just letting go and my eyes began to black out and all sounds became silent and I felt the sensation of d delirium  wash over me my pain was going to be gone and knowing that gave me peace of living meant I had toLive like this I rather be dead than to be like this

This is the absolute best video on the working of the mind I have ever seen.  Absolutely brilliant

The 1st time I ever heard her tell this story I immediately thought that I had this exact experience on Acid. What she describes is almost completely the same experience I had. I always wondered if she might have tried acid after that.

Brilliant ❤️🙏 Love your words xThank you for sharing.

Awesome message, truth -Shared

I watch this when I need to remember what is beautiful about life. We are all connected, yet we are individuals with choices.

She described my first mushroom trip, pixels and all.

Amazing story, thank you for sharing, truly life changing 🌼

Great talk!

So uplifting. Thank You. 🙏

That was an excellent telling of how our brain works &amp; how we can learn to choose that expansive oneness-with-all whenever we want until we leave our physical bodies &amp; return completely to the oneness with all of consciousness.

What a compelling scientific and experiential realities of life by Dr. Jill Taylor who experienced near death existence. This scientific philosophy is very much alike to the [Mahayana] Buddhist view of life of the Nine consciousness or Nine kinds of discernment.“Consciousness” is the translation of the Sanskrit vijnāna, which means discernment. The nine consciousnesses are (1) sight-consciousness ( chakshur-vijnāna), (2) hearing-consciousness (shrota-vijnāna), (3) smell-consciousness (ghrāna-vijnāna), (4) taste-consciousness (jihvā-vijnāna), (5) touch-consciousness (kāya-vijnāna), (6) mind-consciousness (mano-vijnāna), (7) mano-consciousness (mano-vijnāna), (8) ālaya-consciousness (ālaya-vijnāna), and (9) amala-consciousness (amala-vijnāna).  The first five consciousnesses correspond to the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The sixth consciousness integrates the perceptions of the five senses into coherent images and makes judgments about the external world. In contrast with the first six consciousnesses, which deal with the external world, the seventh, or mano-consciousness, corresponds to the inner spiritual world. Awareness of and attachment to the self are said to originate from the mano-consciousness, as does the ability to distinguish between good and evil. The eighth, or ālaya-consciousness, exists in what modern psychology calls the unconscious; all experiences of present and previous lifetimes—collectively called karma—are stored there. The ālaya-consciousness receives the results of one’s good and evil deeds and stores them as karmic potentials or “seeds,” which then produce the rewards of either happiness or suffering accordingly. Hence it was rendered as “storehouse consciousness”. The ālaya-consciousness thus forms the framework of individual existence.Deeper than the eighth consciousness is the ninth consciousness which is known as amala or pure. This is the core of our lives and there is nothing deeper or below it. It is fundamentally pure and is not affected by the torrent of karma swirling above it. It is the expansive energy or greater self, at one with the life of the universe manifesting compassion and wisdom in the external world. This realization is called Buddhahood or Nirvana.

Please read her book of the same name!  Much more detail and it is one of my favorites!!

I was 33 when I had my stroke 7 months ago and she perfectly what I couldn&#39;t put into words of my experience. The whole way through.

Namaste helped me a lot to understand myself, that I can't allow my left side to be the boss, and studying to balance both hemispheres, my dream is to read her books👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏 🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🌳🌻
Incredible, her experience was so scary to me but she relayed it in such a beautiful way.

Thank you for sharing! This is truly inspiring! As a person learning to co-exist with a disability and chronic pain, your story gives me hope. Especially hearing the timeline of 8 years to fully recover.

Thank you Jill. That is an idea worth spreading.

Sounds like taking a dab

Her description of the expanisive moments during her stroke sound very much like psychedelic experience.

This is the essence of what Zen practice has taught me, without a stroke.

Thank you, thank you ...

truly amazing.

The best TED ever.

Wow ❤️
EXCELLENT...A GREAT EYE OPENER PAR BEYOND...

this is incredible! I was very inspired by her words. just to tears

“Like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria”... I dreamt about whales leaping up and out of the ocean the night before watching this. What a beautiful talk.

I literally had a panic attack when she brought out that person&#39;s brain. Can we get a warning on this vid?

That was beautiful. It reminds me of an experience on LSD.

Feel the euphoria when find the nirvana. #7 TED

This is so interesting because we&#39;ve been taught that the right brain is logical and the left brain is more creative or intuitive but when you were describing the right and left brain here it almost seemed like the opposite of that, but then I thought well maybe they&#39;re both logical and intuitive but in different ways.

Very powerful message here.  I had experiences like she described on psychedelics when I was younger, it definitely helps to form a very reasonable and healthy outlook on life.  This video serves as a good reminder to stay in touch with that right half.

For me  there are not superlatives enough in this universe to describe :1 how in touch with this I feel; 2:how this is really what our world is about, how to find balance and equilibrium.

I&#39;ve rewatched this so many times over the years and hadn&#39;t heard it in a few years. Listening to it today, her words are even stronger. In 2017, after years of doing my sleep rituals, I got to this magic place that I couldn&#39;t articulate into words. She&#39;s captured this moment in this talk. There&#39;s a surrendering of self, of yesterday, of tomorrow and of now that&#39;s allowed me to fully appreciate and love with every essence of my being. Since that moment of 2017, I found my joy, I found life. I found love without words. I feel lucky and greatful to live from this place and the opportunity to share this energy and me with all the peeps, I come across with. Thank you Jill for putting your life experience in the best way possible!

The All that Is✨

Absolutely amazing¡! I lack the words to describe how incredible your description of your experience is.

the right brain hemishere functions like a parallel processor &amp; the left brain hemishere functions like a serial processor. 🤔 i wonder if that describes Intel&#39;s Dual Core processor.  what merit would a CPU with a parallel and a serial processor have for Artificial Intelligences? 🤔i wonder.

At the end... which do you chose?

Indeed the most mare=veloustory I have ever heard.  In humans, God created a real miracle, a marvel to behold, admire, treasure, and share,

💙thank you
Years ago, I had a moment when I felt that the nagging in my brain was over. Did I focus entirely on my right brain then? Did my left brain become disabled?😮But I had closed my eyes.
What a story, and what a delivery!! Although it stopped on the most interesting part. When the talk came to the old an fundamental question all I heard was the jingle. <i>Who are choosing to be left or right?</i> <b>*Who*</b> are becoming part or individual &quot;moment by moment&quot;?

If you watch and understand this, you&#39;ll understand the core of quantum entanglement! She&#39;s so accurate it&#39;s almost impossible!

How impressive

Even today, when I review this lecture, I get emotional!!!
Beautiful

💜 why am I cryiing?

What an incredible woman!

Wow! Incredible!❤
wonderful! all human beings should see it!

Wow , I almost cried. That&#39;s something.

Unify the two brains into one
The subtitles are a big rhythmic shift from his words!
Wow, that was an Amazing Lecture by a Beautifully Gifted and Strong Spirit filled women who was given a Unique perspective into her Scientific Work like no other. I think this is one of the Best Talks I have ever Watched. Thank you for Posting this.

As well as reminding me of the stories of enlightenment and Bodhisattvas, this also reminds me of shamanic initiation experience. There is a universal human experience here. I&#39;m so glad she has been able to share. It&#39;s wonderful that she can describe this experience so clearly and insightfully.

This is just an amazing performance! Thank you very much!
If only she could tell us how...

Great achievement,  great person , my sincere congratulations❤ ...maybe in one of the appearances you may talk about the physiotherapy and the struggle it is with the recovery time for people to understand  and fight for recovery too  ...a physiotherapist

Best TED talk i ever watched!

🙏 Congratulations
I saw a portion of the video on another video on the right and left brain hemispheres. With the rhetoric and emphasis she seems to be pushing a pantheistic energy subjectiveness.

It is called Aiwaskia, spelled right, DMT or lotus flowers...   mushrooms..   they all connect us to that universe she speaks of.  this has been hidden from people not as single humans but as a human organism.   meditation and sounds are ways but they take a long time plants or fungi are a cheat but look at us...example everyone got Shots right what would have been so wrong with everyone taking a big handful of mushrooms on the right day and everyone Collectively goes to that place.   that is what decmeber 21 or the Solstice is and will always be.2022 12 21 is the same planet wise so that is when they used to connect key moments of the &quot;year&quot; so that everyone could be there same time same channel.when plants are illegal for whatever reason some else says and shots and pills are ok and sometime required we have become out of balance to the planet organizm we live on.

Interesting how some of the things she has said about the right brain (thinking in pictures, being overly sensitive to sensory stimulus, not using language for thinking) reminds to people with autism. Could it be that people with autism tend to use more the right hemisphere?

Thank you Ad for translating ❤
Truly awesome!  You express so beautifully and eloquently what I have committed myself to teaching as a spiritual awareness practice.   Thankyou.   My younger (61 year old and very youthful ) brother had a similar type stroke a few weeks ago and I have told him that he has had a stroke of luck!  He liked that but I think I prefer your &#39;stroke of insight&#39; so I may pinch it!    Thankyou so much for helping me understand what I am trying to teach and may you have many many more beautiful years ahead to share your insights.

Impressive speech and impressive video

You’re amazing Dr Taylor 🤍👏🏼It’s still enlightening to watch this speech of yours. Have watched this 20 timesI’ve chosen my side couple years ago✌🏼💫

Who else cried? Thank you Jill from the bottom of my heart.❤️

... great my right brain wants to be in charge on full of life, and my left brain keeps telling it no...

Undoubtedly the most amazing Ted talk I, personally, have ever watched. Thank you so very much for so artfully sharing your personal journey. Blessed be.

amazing

Right and left side stroke are different. And I may say for sure that each stroke is very individual the same as delivery. You never know what it could be before it happened. 8 years is a long way to recover. My father had a left side stroke and it took him one year and three month to die. As many people with the same kind of stroke had just one way ... to death. The woman was lucky to get the right treatment in the right time. It is 90 percent of luck for recovery. Speech is fabulous. She tells what she really felt and she is honest. Very inspiring! I hope she is still healthy and happy.

Best TED talk of all time.

Beautiful

Most of that is usually called astral travels. Wish people can do it while sleeping, 🤔🤔🤔🤔 so are this people, including me, are having a stroke??? But we are not going to ER, we weak up at the next, personally, with a sensation that I didn’t want to come back. On the other hand, I will be super happy the mind stay quiet every single minute. Can we really choose? In the moment we born, our mind is bombarded with our parents ideas, beliefs, behavior, television with a lot of publicity washing our mind, school, etc. And it is terrible, we should learn how to use both hands to develop both side of the brain, we have the ability of telepathy, telekinesis, to heal ourselves, to learn languages, etc. Like she said, we are energy and that is the way we should see ourselves, no differences. Nevertheless, where bad energies come from?? Other galaxies, black holes,,,,,,???? Maybe a stroke is the interference of two different energies that causes an interruption in the brain….

The Miraculous Brain book had very interesting content.

Beautifully narrated the Energy Frequencies surrounded us when our Souls are freed from our Temporal Karma Based Bodies that many felt during the Brief Moment of Transcendental Release from  bodily limitation during Near Death Experience but many can&#39;t expressed them as Good as Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor! Yes , we are Spiritual Beings in physical bodies! Thank You So Much for sharing the Enlightening Experience!

Her description of her stroke sounds terrifyingly like a high-dose psychedelic experience.  The moment of the boundary between you and the universe dissolving, the cognitive dissonance, the whole shebang

That is a precious TED talk.

What&#39;s mean nirvana?

As a stroke survivor from 15 days ago, this talk touched my soul. Her description of what was happening physically, mentally and spiritually during the stroke accurately describes my experience. Jill Bolte Taylor, you have made such a difference for me. Thanks for sharing your story!

Every time I watch this truly miraculous video, it brings tears to my eyes. “Whom do we choose to be?” - spiritual beings or just materialized animal-like creatures with low morality and responsibility before the society we all live in.

Glad Jordan Peterson brought me here, great TED talk

Beautiful, thank you so much for sharing.

Thank you for being who you are. Just thank you. Amazing

I would like to add that we are not really talking about different consciousnesses. It&#39;s about what happens to consciousness when the original experience (memory) is abnormally altered. In this case, the descending stimuli associated with left hemisphere experience are disrupted effectively.

Tell &#39;em, Free Girl!!

She reminds me of the coolest 5th grade teacher I never had...👏😻!

Wow!!

who are we? we are slaves to money. We don&#39;t have a choice in the matter. if you pay rent or a mortgage, you work for a living. yet slavery is illegal, isn&#39;t it? ☮️🖖🎶yet AIs won&#39;t take over.

best ever TED talk. Thanks Dr Jill. It was stupendofantabulouschasmatogorically amazing. Absolutely wonderful.

3g of dried shrooms…exactly all she described, and more.

amazing and very insightful. WOW! Thank you

I haven’t found any peace or nirvana since my stroke 😥

I first saw this when I was in stroke rehab in 2015.

Why do you need to be one or the other?

I&#39;m reading this book now I&#39;m halfway through it I am determined to be well I can&#39;t speak too much I have aphasia. So I&#39;m hoping it will turn out well

This is so powerful. i love this &quot;Spiritual things with a scientific mind&quot;. Thank you for your sharing.

I’ve had a stroke. It has been eleven months. I could not even say yes or no when it happened, or for a few days later. I felt and continue to feel the sense of Nirvana. It has pushed me to recover, not for myself, but for others. This took me 30 minutes to write. Time for a nap. : )

Best TED talk of all time. I watch it annually.

Great video, we all have the ability to choose who we are and how we live our lives at any time. Although I have watched it hundreds of times.
Language creates our reality

I heard you got a strokeYeah it was fun

Amazing
I don’t care 🤷‍♀️ from this world 🌎 or the next one👨🏼‍🚀👰🏼
That's when I think I've screwed up my life. Why didn't I learn when I had the chance. And why did they start later, I'm interested in such scientific things 😔. I fucked you 😔
<a href="">14:30</a> this may sound weird, but I had an acid trip where my experience almost perfectly matched that of her stroke. it was pure, unfiltered energy of consciousness and the vast infinite expanse that it traveled, and there was no me. The phone read 5:33pm, except it must have felt like thousands of years before the minute finally changed. I don&#39;t believe in a god, but I also don&#39;t believe that life and consciousness ends after death. I don&#39;t think death is the end.

I am so wonderfully speechless as the things she was talking  Same feelings , same emotions happened to me after my brain stroke.. I thought i was the only one who have same fealings.. My stroke was not that big like her.. But feeling are so true.. One of best of videos i came across in you tube in my life... &lt;3

but how ? how to embrace more of  our right brain?

So...what meditation does is get me into the right hemisphere. or at least out of the left.

After 10 years of watching this Ted talk for the first time I still find myself coming back to here from time to time. The best Ted talk I’ve ever watched, this story was inspirational

While touching and indeed moving, her theory is incorrect, as a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist I would like to point out that the idea of Left / Right hemisphere for Logic/Creation/Spirituality is completely obsolete and is more of a myth. Ask any neuroscientist or neurologist. If you look at the scientific literature (see source below) you will see that functional MRI have proven multiple times that both hemisphere work in tandem for unity of thought and action and this involves a vast bilateral network of cortical and subcortical areas. Indeed, some personalities are more logic and some more creative but this is NOT due to a higher activity in a particular hemisphere. Because her speech is very emotional, it seems captivating and reason seems less appealing in comparison, indeed I am aware that some of you will be blind to what I just wrote because of the bias of confirmation.Overall, this remind me of science in general : the astrophysicist Dr Carl Sagan emphasize often that while speculation is essential it is equally important to be skeptic and to study facts, to reason and the general idea that it is better to welcome the universe as it is not as one would like it to be. In the past, it was emotionally appealing to think that the Earth was at the center of solar system or the universe, but is it really the case ?Source : Nielsen, J. A., Zielinski, B. A., Ferguson, M. A., Lainhart, J. E., &amp; Anderson, J. S. (2013). An Evaluation of the Left-Brain vs. Right-Brain Hypothesis with Resting State Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

The world of the right brain is exactly like the worldview of Zen!
I think this video describes why I had a strokein bed and awoke under the bed thinking that the l and was in hospital withy favourite rock band and met Elton John with them plus I also attempted to pass  selection ...

Incredible thank you for shining and sharing! I had an experience during hypnotherapy/ifs while grounded on the earth where I saw in my minds eye the outline of my masculine and feminine and in the middle fire/light and that was were the peace resided. My therapist recommended this video to me afterwards. So grateful. 💚

Fantastic TED...thaks alot for share with us...I have a sister with esquiziofrenia and a brother with bipolarity and my lfe its a litle complex...but to listen your history and your passion to study and investigate all in the brain makes me a hopefully person. Thanks a lot!

Yo who&#39;s here still watching in 2022?

This is very profound .Gifted only to watch this video only now but better late than ever.Thank almighty.

This sounds like the scientific explanation of the experience expert meditators report

♥️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽♥️thank you and yes I have to leave LA it is killing me because WE does not exist here.

wow. Thanks

In love with every sentence she said ,that’s great 😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
That’s how meditation can lead us to

I must have watched this more than ten times over the years and it never ceases to be impactful.

Beautiful.  From this, one thing I get is that our brains do keep us in check. I like the immensity of being you experienced when the left side malfunctioned. But, for what purpose are we kept in check. The feeling of being part of and one with the existence and energy you felt around you, through you can be reached without having to suffer the near catastrophic event you did. Continuing on your journey with the insight is such a privilege and you are certainly one to appreciate that. Please, share more of what you have learned, because what we know of life is not just substantive; there is so much more.

Incredible ♥️♥️♥️💪💪💪💪💪
I have watched this video so many times and I&#39;m still amazed and fascinated every. single. time. What an incredible story.

My grandfather had a stroke right before my 3rd year exams in campus. It is one of the most difficult experiences I have lived through. And yet it is not enough to picture from this perspective how much it has done to him. I love him more than I love my own father. This video is profound to me, as I can empathize with his state a little better than I ever could.

Anyone else getting ASMR vibes from this?

Sounds like a DMT trip

I had to watch this for a class...absolutely beautiful.

Its like...she&#39;s been scientifically explaining what happens when one achieves Satori or enlightenment. This mirrors to a T what Alan Watts spent his life chasing. Theres some merit here. Some ground of something. An answer.  But what&#39;s the question?

Such a beautiful mind.

I was in the audience. Unforgettable.

Even after all these years, I still get emotional hearing this powerful talk and am reminded how pwerful and beautiful the mind is.  Thank you for sharing your unique and beautiful experience. ❤️

as relevant today as ever .. beautiful

Last March22, 2021, I had a schemic stroke. My left side of the body got paralyzed. The stroke affected my perietal lobe..

Imm commenting here trying to look for a nuero scientist to ask about my stroke. I am aware this is a long shot... But what the heck. It&#39;s worth a try.

Comment for dr Jill. Does God come into play in any of this?

She must be one of the best public speakers ever. I was listening to the story from the beginning to the end  without loosing it for a second. Which is very rare for me.

Powerful

I love this message

And by the time that I awoke, fingers closing around my throat. And by the the time that I awoke....

What a beautiful and brilliant human being!

This made me cry... though I am a tough guy...still tears flowing

I had a stroke when I had my baby last year. I noticed that my cognitive skills were damaged. At the moment, I am still recovering from this extremely traumatic situation. I would lovely like to talk to people similar to my situation and how long it took you to recover so that you felt normal. Thanks

A mask was forced on my face and my arms were strapped down, when I had my third C- Section. That was after I called out that I felt the cold liquid , before the cutting started. I don’t know what gas they gave me through the mask, but I completely lost who I was, where I was or why I was. I felt everything and could hear distant voices. When I heard a nice comforting voice I felt better. I later realized it was my Husband Bill. That was when I saw him and asked him where I was. Then I asked him what we had, he said a boy, you should know, you held him.

I don&#39;t get what people see in this...

I also had an aneurysm in 2005 and it affected my right side and my tongue. I am Surprised how the Dr. completely recovered I did not recover and I continue taking physical therapy, but how I was without speaking, without walking, I was right-handed and I had to learn to be left-handed for everything: eating, writing, putting on makeup, bathing, for everything . He used a splint on his right leg to walk. And 4 Point Staff. I don't have Balance at 💯 and he tired me a lot and when he spoke he dragged his Tongue. But Thank God I'm Alive and I'm really looking forward to Life. I cycle, I took Aquarobics and Physical Therapy and I feel very grateful to God for all the people who have supported me, such as my son, my brothers and friends!!!!!
I heard the thing from myself again

champion 🏆
Jill thank you thank you. I experienced that same expansiveness a few times in my spiritual journey 🙏🏼

Jill thank you thank you. I experienced that same expansiveness a few times in my spiritual journey 🙏🏼

AMAZING /// POWERFUL /// ENLIGHTENING

I was born without a Corpus Callosum. Discovering this, changed my life.

I want to know who&#39;s brain that was. Who was this person? How did this person live? Where did this person live? What dreams were accomplished? I would&#39;ve applauded that person for allowing us to have a look into his entrails.

<a href="">15:38</a> when she cracks...

Wow! Simply amazing! Your testimony simply was so worth sharing since it will touch many lives.  Yes! Anything is possible by our higher being.  It&#39;s a matter of faith.  Yes! Also, how much are we willing to put into taking care of our health.You&#39;re a living testimony and a miracle.  The Book of Mark in my Holy book emphasizes many miracles.  Thank you for this testimony.  Simply Beautiful 🌺

Usually a woman plays with the heart more that the brain, but I guess this works.

a must see for all survivors of a stroke!!!!

God damn
Incredible!

Right here, right now and left here, left now. 😮 😯 😲 Right hemisphere - right here, right now, I am in the present. Left hemisphere - I left here, I left now, so I am in the future, in the past, my mind is gone but my body is still here. Wow! English is cool!

Awesome 👏

Beautiful, profound and accordingly to the so needed new human for the new world.

Two times i experienced something similar, although i did not have a stroke. The first time was in 1996, in the first few seconds of waking up from anesthesia after a minor surgery. At first i did not know where i was, who i was, even IF i was at all. I was in a kind of white &#39;la la land&#39; as she describes it, and indeed, it was as if there were no boundaries between me... only after a very short moment i realised i was a person. And then i realised i was Hannah. And then realised i had some strange bodily sensations, and then realised i was in the hospital, and i was still alife :-). It was a very strange experience. I have never met anyone who experienced such a thing. And i thought it would only happen when waking up from anesthesia. In 2012 i underwent a heavy surgery, but did not have this experience. Only but a few weeks ago, i was sleeping. At some point i had this exact similar experience, and then woke up. Which is a bit disturbing, because... well, i don&#39;t do drugs, i did not drink alcohol, so what was it? I still don&#39;t know. So it is very interesting, to come across this story (via some art website, i&#39;m an artist). What does it mean?

Matrix what? 😉
Wow! This was 14 years ago! Damn!!! This was incredible.  Jill truly is such an incredible storyteller, and wow her journey through all of this.  Thank you Emily Flecther (my wonderful and beautiful friend who taught me how to access both hemispheres through her Ziva meditation ) For guiding me to this Ted Talk!

only watched it now. beyond amazing

I like her appearance: Face, hair, clothes, etc. Looks like she came out of 1996. I call it the Matilda era since that&#39;s the year the movie was released. &quot;My moment of transition&quot;. I like how she worded it that way instead of saying &quot;I&#39;m dead&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m dying&quot; or &quot;I die&quot;. it made me sad when she was starting to get emotional. Her voice quivering when talking about nirvana, etc.

A true inspiration ❤
She is describing both what a stroke feels during the pain and is processed like and what Cluster headaches feel like pain wise. Both are very different after pain is over.

Call me a negative Nancy, but my Left brain sees this Ted Talk as missing something. You see, I had a right sided massive stroke, and it WASN&#39;T fun! In fact far from it. I&#39;m still dealing with paralysis. Strokes kill lots of people or ruin their lives. Which is why I can&#39;t say this is a good Ted Talk.

They&#39;re not really delusioned, but instead, scrambled, and if  you&#39;re making your dreams come true, the you&#39;re manifesting on a high level, probably involved in blood sacrifices to get it done, and likely the reason your brother isn&#39;t sharing in your world.  I hate witches like this lady with everything that i am, and more, they sell out their siblings and children to the occult, then spend their lives making bogus careers out of the trafficking and experiments, never mind the abuse.  Fu kc all you at TED.

You are such a chosen one! Thank you for your strength and for being so vulnerable, I&#39;m beyond inspired!

I always feel that when I lose the function of my left brain, this speaker's situation is like taking drugs. Could it be that drugs are used to paralyze the left side of the brain to make oneself high; some are used to paralyze the right side of the brain so that one cannot feel external signals, including pain (the human brain looks so disgusting! I didn’t expect that there is one in my head)
Sensational!!!
I&#39;m starting to wonder if I have had a hundred little strokes in my life...

one of the best ted talks

Step to the right of my left hemisphere. 🙏🌈

Incredible and insightful story!!🙌🏾💯

Moved beyond measure. Thank you Dr. Jill, you magnificent specimen. Much love to you.

Who needs the subtitles?
LOOK AT MY VIDEOS IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE LAST DAYS WARNING SIGNS WRITTEN DOWN 2000 years ago

14 minutes on just gets to me ….. thank you !

Third time watching … amazing !!!

There is another experience that provides a similar connection to what lies beyond the physical--a near-death experience (NDE).  I know.  because I&#39;ve had one. . . TWICE. At age 7.  and again at age 14.  I was clinically dead for 5-6 minutes.  During those moments.  what I saw.  felt and experienced changed my life.  I am now 50.  and not a day goes by without the incredibly vivid memories of those events coming to my mind. Having spent a great deal of time both speaking to others who have had NDEs and studying other NDE stories online and in print.  I have come to several conclusions.  One.  NDEs have been documented as long as modern human beings have existed on this planet.  They have happened in every country.  culture.  and belief system. . . and across every race and demographic.  and both sexes. Two.  the one commonality between all who have experienced an NDE is a complete lack of fear of death.  &quot;The Great Unknown&quot; that has plagued humankind for all of recorded history. . . the final mystery. . . is not unknown or mysterious to US.  The fact that none of us come back with any fear of what we saw or experienced should both tell everyone that they have nothing to fear.  and make them think that perhaps there is more to what comes next than they believed. Three.  despite the wide variety of experiences that have been documented by groups such as IANDS (International Association for Near-Death Studies).  as well as in print.  on film.  and in other mediums such as this one. . . there is actually something that links all of them together.  something that took me many years to theorize and understand.  but once I reached this conclusion.  everything made sense. You see.  like many people out there.  I was indoctrinated with the false idea perpetuated by Christianity that all NDEs are religious in nature.  They put that narrative out there because to allow a narrative that goes against their beliefs would weaken their hold over people.  And if your only view of NDEs was movies like Breakthrough.  Heaven Is For Real.  90 Minutes In Heaven.  and Miracles From Heaven. . . or the narrative perpetuated for centuries that the only NDE story that existed was going through a white tunnel.  meeting your dead relatives.  seeing Jesus and angels.  and so on. . . you could be forgiven for questioning your own NDEs if they didn&#39;t fit the prescribed dogma. . . as mine didn&#39;t.  And I spent years questioning mine.  I doubted what I saw and experienced.  despite the fact that it had been as clear to me as any memory in my head--moreso.  in fact. But then I read books such as My Stroke Of Insight.  and Proof Of Heaven / Map Of Heaven (Dr.  Eben Alexander).  Stephen Lives! (Anne Puryear).  and the many books in the On Death And Dying series by Dr.  Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.  I also spoke to others who had had NDEs.  And I realized that not only were all NDEs NOT all Christianity-based. . . but that the vast majority were not. And I tried to understand how that could be.  How could such wildly-varying NDE stories all be true? It finally came to me in a &quot;Eureka!&quot; moment. If you were in charge of creating an experience that anyone could have.  regardless of their age.  background.  belief system.  or any other separator. . . where they wouldn&#39;t question the experience.  and would accept that they were dead. . . how would you do it?Well. . . what if you could create an experience that could alter itself based on the person experiencing it? What if it was fully interactive.  tied into your mind.  able to be malleable and able to be altered in real-time? Essentially.  that&#39;s what an NDE is. And a lot of the Nirvana.  expansive feeling Dr.  Taylor describes both here and in her book of the same name is VERY similar to the experience of an NDE.  That feeling of being so big.  and how am I going to fit all of this into that tiny body. . . the way all of the responsibilities and ties to everything here just fall away. . . the absolute freedom and feeling of euphoria. . . I experienced ALL OF THOSE.  and more.  during my NDEs.  They were the most wonderful.  amazing.  beautiful.  incredible experiences of my entire life.  bar none. I come back to watch this TED Talk on a regular basis.  because it--and other similar experiences--reminds me of some of what I experienced all those years ago. And it&#39;s especially important to me now.  because I have 2 major conditions.  One is physical.  stemming from severe post-surgical complications following 5-level cervical spine laminectomy and fusion in May 2019. But the other is CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy).  due to 16 severe TBIs.  all but one of which was due to bullying between the ages of 7 and 16.  and the last of which resulted from falling on ice 5 years ago. And unfortunately.  since July of 2021.  that condition has gotten significantly worse at the same time as the physical condition did.  and I was told less than 2 months ago that I&#39;m now in end-stage CTE.  I am developing Progressive Dementia (which eventually leads to Alzheimer&#39;s).  and I only have 2 to 5 years left.  but likely on the lower end of that range.  So the day is swiftly approaching when I won&#39;t be &quot;just visiting&quot; that realm that I saw all those years ago. . . but will finally get to stay.  And honestly. . . I&#39;m really looking forward to it.  🙂

She nailed it.

wow im honoured to llisten to this . wow

<a href="">9:00</a> sounds like she took a bunch of acid and was trippin ballz :))

What an awakening! 🙏

I am so glad I came across this, thank you google for sending me here.

Awesome astravakra gita explained by Sandeep Maheshwari and this Ted video are complete to get enlightenment.

I made the mistake of thinking I could watch this in the background while I work....my brain said &quot;No! She is talking about us!!!&quot;. This lady is amazing!

Wow!  This is where I am in my life at 59!  Everything is about peace and mindfulness.  Yoga and meditation and feeling alive and connected.  From my en experiences it has shown me with the sweetest clarity where I go now and as you stated - “what I choose”.  Thank you for sharing this amazing insight into the innermost compacted and yet most simple thing in our bodies.  It already “is”.  We just have to choose to be the explorers in our own life and to be willing and curious enough to partake in the phenomenal journey!

My brother also has schizophrenia. I just a stroke.

Oh I am so thankful 🙏 I found you.10months into my stroke. It&#39;s so hard.I&#39;m not alone.Thank you for sharing.

Amazing
super love this.

enlightenment is a different process for everyone

God (takes notes furiously):

very low quality for an official video!

this idea has been spreading with ancient cultures all the time, with specific methods and whole systems supporting the methods. such a pity they are not in humanities&#39; top priorities.

Thank you so much I&#39;m praying that my speech will get better in time I had a stroke 4 years ago and I&#39;m just really lucky that it&#39;s just a speech God bless you you give me hope hope thanks

Her near to death experience lead her to see the whole nature of her being. And now that out of body experience has become her mesaage. There&#39;s no such a thing as individuals. You and I do not exist. We are the UNIVERSE.

I will always need this.

This was shared through our focus group. It is an entertaining, cheerful and factual presentation of how the brain works.  Well worth listening to. Learned things I can remember and use in my daily life.  Listen, learn and enjoy!!

Fantastic! Thank you so much! Gratitude &lt;3
I had a stroke just not long ago, it was (still is) the most scary and painful period. My age was considered “too young” to have a stroke. My experiences were similar to Dr. Taylor’s, but mine might be worse. I promised myself when I feel much better I would share my story. Thank you Dr. Taylor for sharing yours.

Every Single Time Tears Of AN Overwhelming Joy and Excitement Whilst Tearing Up Large, Thank You Dr Jill Bolte-Taylor and Jill :))

Spectacular 🥰
Beautiful ♥️🥰
The silence of the lambs 😬was in the hall
What this neuroscientist brings us is incredible!! She quickly manages to synthesize, through her own experience, the functioning of this mysterious organ, showing how neuronal connections work and their effects on our understanding of life! It made me laugh and cry, the way it showed different ‘normal’ or so-called pathological personalities was moving! Inclusion and peace🙏🏼 to everyone! Gratitude for your generosity and ability to connect with us!❤️
I also watched this because of the bios clock, it was very good.
Super presentation
She simply visited and explained (by virtue of being a brain scientist) something known by the ancient hindu sciences over centuries..ie..the panch kosh or five levels of existence of human  mind.

&quot;Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.&quot; -Carl JungI believe Carl Jung had something similar in his mind when creating his own framework. I think there&#39;s a reason why Spiritualism/Mindfulness/Jungian Typology/MBTI/Enneagram have become more prevalent in our modern age. These practices all ask the participant to recognize the unconscious mind -- on some level the &#39;parallel processor&#39;, the right brain.There are many problems modern society is currently at odds with. The pandemic as well has exposed where many systems fail. There&#39;s been a push for individuals to remove themselves from those failing systems. People responding to automation, 9-5 jobs, poor mental health, the burden that puts on the soul.. There&#39;s come a time where the world has recognized we cope with our left brains, and don&#39;t pay enough attention to the unconscious mind, our &#39;soul&#39;.

The most memorable TedTalk ever. Still a riveting story after many watches. I wonder what caused a 30 something woman to have a stroke.

that was awesome. What an amazing story.

Wonderful experience... gratitude!!!!
Epic!  A classic TED Talk!  I have watched it more than once though the years, but my new year resolution is to memorize it to improve my English.  Love you all!

A quick word of appreciation for Autodesk. My career was launched by customizing and automating AutoCad to assist the process and mechanical engineers.It was some of the most rewarding, as well.Cheers to John Walker, author and co-founder!

When I’m having a really bad dissociative episode, I feel a lot like she does when she talks about “la la land” it feels like piloting a mech, very deliberate, very much not in tune with the reality that you are real, that what you’re seeing isn’t just something flesh colored metal. I wish I experienced half the amount of bliss she describes but it always just feels… monotonous. Just out of everything, seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks, it feels like it’s all at once. It feels like once I’m finally grounded and in my own body that I’ve skipped forward in time, which albeit is convenient for some situations, is really rather distressing. To know I’m losing so much time not being alive, not being fully awake, not being aware. It’s alarming. I know likely no one will see this, and that’s okay. I think I’m most likely keeping this as a diary entree to show my therapist whenever I get one, if I remember. Which is a key part of why dissociative episodes for myself are so distressing. It’s so hard to remember, to function. Everything is on autopilot and if it’s not in the routine it’s not done, and nothing is remembered. I’ve needed to pick up medicine for weeks now and I can’t remember. I can’t get my brain to stay lodged on a task long enough to remember anything. It didn’t use to be like this. It didn’t use to be like this.

Almost makes me realize how much all life is like in Avatar. Connected and full of flowing energy, and it can only be experienced by living in the here and now.

I&#39;m being forced to watch this(

My crude understanding is, right is infinite love everprevading and left is life and its struggles and evolving and is of finite time sensitive nature may suffer at old age with alzheimer disease particularly. Thanks for this sincere presenters efforts and that video as well.

This woman is my spirit animal

&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 M E R C I   I N F I N I M E N T ! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

How would this experience have manifested if the clot was on the right brain instead?

Spiritual fluff aside, this is an interesting insight into the experience associated with the right hemisphere

So how can I turn off my left hemisphere without having a stroke?

Brilliant!   Thanks for posting.

First time seeing this today. What a powerful talk.

From Rio de Janeiro/BRAZIL. CONGRATULATIONS!!NOV/2021
So powerful 👏
Can&#39;t stop my tears😢😢

incredible

Goood act....

How do you know you weren&#39;t hallucinating?

Remarkable talk!I think we should simply recognize there is no “la la land of  oneness with the universe&#39;&#39; for any individual without first oneness with the right as well as the left brain. It&#39;s a paradox we all  face. First heal thyself. By evolution, we are sent into the world with two brains. By any and all means we want to do good for ourselves and others. For each of us, that goal HAS  to be done as a messed up two brained individual. Peace.

Going to watch right now with my bebe poncho

<a href="">15:23</a>

Meditation is a method to still the left atmosphere and enjoy the right atmosphere.

Wow, I love her so much

In one word &quot;perfect&quot; di
Jill, you precious soul💕 Thank you💕
ONE OF THE BEST!!

When mind stopsWhen ego destroyed When you feel you are not body mind complexWhen you feel total silent mind When you feel energy all around you When you feel blissThis is called enlightenment This is called nirvanaThis is called atmabodh This is called atmaanubhuti This called Advait Anubhuti This is called onenessThis is called non dual experienceThis is called oom This is called brahmdarshan This is called shivohamThis is called satchidanandThis called ahambrasmi This is called mukti This is called kevalya This called mokshaThis is called god We can attain this peacefulness state by meditation for permanently For momentarily by lsd drugs or ahahuscaFor deeper understanding By reading spritual text of mystics of all religion like Rumi, aadi Shankaracharya ekhart meister , rammana maharishi,nisargdatta maharaj ,jd Krishnamurthy, astravakra gita ,abhdhutagita , mandukya upnishad .ken upnishad..In Hinduism this state is called mukti means total freedom and the philosophy whic describes this phenomenon is called Advait Vedanta.

नमस्ते देवी। Namaste devi .may the bliss of atma or brahman always with you

She is so intelligent scientist! Love and. Respect 💕

Formidable.

Thanks to my psychology instructor gave me this video. Her presentation is incredible!!!!

Wow wow wow wooooow What a talk what a words what a message what a woman I&#39;m glad that Google UX Course brought me here one of the greatest talks I&#39;ve ever listened

Sounds like an LSD trip

I truly enjoyed this video, especially on the fact that you mentioned how you were inspired to do your jobs by wanting to know more about your brother&#39;s psychological disorder.

Beautiful 💜💙❤
Such an incredible way to describe something that would otherwise seem so terribly frightening. Thank you for your story!

If anyone wants to actually experience what she&#39;s talking about, I recommend the Youtube channel: Simply Always Awake

Wow

Strange.. Right/left hemisphere theory is out of date as far as I know.  It&#39;s not supported by scientific evidence. And I can&#39;t understand why she brought a real human brain.

My husband had a stroke on Thursday and I stumbled upon this TED talk in tears last night. I found Dr Jill’s experience so helpful and positive. While I am still concerned about my husband, I feel so much better and calmer about the situation.

i&#39;d choose both of a person. As we are one anyway. &#39;The total number of  minds in the Universe is one.&quot; -some old. Austrian scientist. ☮️🎶🧘

what are the differences of the effects between a brain hemorrhage stroke and MELAS  Sydrome Stroke like episode? MELAS Syndrome is  a type of Mitochondrial Disease. i had  a right hemisphere MELAS Syndrome Stroke like episode that was misdiagnosed as Major Depression and went untreated way back in 2013. How would you help a person Who hears two devil voices? Would you recommend neurplacity inducing food and meditation? What  neurotransmitters cause voices that speak Japanese yet sound like the devil? are they dopamine or glutamate. i&#39;m asking for a loved one. How would you help them? ☮️🖖🧘🎶

Yes! You reached or started experiencing  a realm what advanced yogis or self-realised souls have experienced or do experience and share with this world. The ancient Indian scriptures all talk about gaining this experience through meditation.

So basically she was tripping on stroke

<b>*Watches the video*</b><b>*looks at hands*</b><b>*freaks out*</b>

This is incredible. I can&#39;t imagine the kind of person who could dislike this video. Must be a real sad existence...

How can I achieve right brain hemisphere specialization, in other words, move to the right hemisphere of brain?

I started crying as soon as she began describing the right hemisphere. So incredible - thank you Jill ❤️👏🔥

I’ve watched this so many time &amp; it still gets me emotional. The story is beyond incredible, but the manner in which she recounts it is awe inspiring, powerful &amp; poetic. Thank you for being a story we can all com back to time &amp; time again. Utterly moving. ✨

So sad for her to have suffered but the beauty is we all learn from her creative mind. Amazing gifted woman

Incredible!

watching this really just makes me want to choose my left hemisphere, for sure. oof

have you ever tried lsd?

Killisou chapur ren mefiom ngani kirh hipwe menaw ren. Thank you for your insights for all of us to live for.

I'm so moved that I can't put it into words. Maybe the reason we are moved to tears is because we already know. Thank you for uploading the video.
You are not your left or right, your future or past. You are the center between the two.

love u sister bless u n family n loved onces

Absolutely incredible makes me ALMOST want to change my major from photography to psychology...almost

Comes from melodysheep!

A lesson for life!!!! Sensational!!!!!!
Amazing story!! So inspirational!
Welcome to DMT.

Extraordinary experience for an extraordinary woman and scientist, thank you 💜
I suppose what she experienced is  very similar to Budha experienced during his enlightment. facinating!

Thanking you dr i was  allmost crying with  you love you to  stating the truth love you

I&#39;ve listened to many spiritual talks and I understood what nirvana was about (kind of), but her perspective just brought a beautiful new dimension to it. So the left brain is the ego..🤔 . I say this with every beautiful talk, but this is now my new favorite ❤️❤️😁😁!!

Still think the brain thinks or perceives ? It is only matter, just like your kidney or liver, complex but insatient, inert matter !

I read her book over a decade ago and I remember thinking at the time, how differently a college professor looks at things than some one with a different brain organization. Professors did well in school, ergo they read very well. To read well you need a brain that is unilaterally organized, such that the eye dominance is on the same side of the brain as the ear dominance, mostly right eye and right ear. That is so the visual part of the brain seeing a word has ready access to the vocabulary in the auditory part of the brain. If those two are on opposite sides of the brain that is most difficult. As a result a professor literally lives in that dominant hemisphere and largely ignores the other hemisphere, usually the right hemisphere. That is why when forced to use only that right hemisphere she described it as a fuzzy ill defined place that did not suit her. The world is run by the unilaterally organized and they are literally half wits.

I'm great ❤️❤️❤️
I came across the most reliable person Trii7tek.k@Instagram and he granted me access to my partners device
Clickbait
Wow!!!!

Wat  if speech is lost

Please define me? She says it gripped me. Etc and ‘my’.  As in my body.  Who is it that owns a body? Thank you so much. X

This sounds like an avid trip. Do you think this is why people who have experimented with hallucinogens genera have a more open mind?

We indians who believe in Sanathana Dharma, always turn right, all always auspicious things we do through the right hand, always eat with right hand.When we pass through a cow, idol, brahmin, yogi, huge auspicious trees...etc.. We choose them to be on our right aider...An amazing talk...thank you

Ive felt the sameway tripping on LSD, mushrooms and DMT so damn

Came here after someone mentioned it in a Facebook post 🥵

I felt the same way the first time I had general surgery and the anesthesiologist pumped the drugs into my veins. A terrific ride in the Mystery Machine!!!

Amazing!!!!
quantum mechanics are discovering now the universe that the ancient doctrines they described,  this woman saw it

Years ago I had my 1st and only bout of insomnia. I tried everything to relax mind and body in order to pass out. I only vaguely knew what meditation was and decided to try it at 2 am in a last ditch effort.I somehow managed to achieve an out of body experience. The sense of being liberated from your body, like a genie from a bottle; of your body feeling heavy and peculiar. Of being unable to differentiate between your body and the space around you. It was what I felt. I felt a oneness, and a peace. There was no emotion or stress, just serenity. A feeling of being anchored to the physical whilst simultaneously experiencing the astral.I&#39;ve never experienced it since, but I have been meditating. Hopefully I&#39;ll have a similar experience again.

Cant stop my tears, jill you are FREE. Lots of Love and Wishes. Namaskaram

An effective perspective that unlocks you nd eases you naturally ...great

That is one of the most beautiful things ive seen

and we thank you for spreading it

I come back to this video when the state of our Earth is just too much to bear. She&#39;s wonderful and once again she makes me weep.

Best Ted talk ever.

This chick is amazing.

6-4-2020. I woke up in the morning, walked out to the living room where my husband was drinking coffee. I started to talk to him. He said I sounded off.  &#39; I&#39;m sleepy &#39; I said n went back to sleep some more.  After awhile I got up , walked in to the living room and said hi to him.  He said I still sounded off. Something isn&#39;t right. Get in the car. They took me in at Emergency right away. A group of doctors/nurses descent on me ....can I move this n that, what&#39;s today .... Into C scan  I went.Yup, I had a stroke.It&#39;s 13 months later n recovery continues...... I&#39;m exhausted.

I am deeply moved.

This was great!

I think she experienced reality outside of the matrix.

One of my absolutely FAVORITE talks!!! Incredible to hear a trained observer recalling their own experiences in crisis. Such an incredible opportunity for insight.

why does a stroke damn near seem like a crazy mushroom or lsd trip in my opinion

So basically this means we are all interconnected to this whole world in a ball of energy while our left hemisphere tells us this is us as an individual.

her talk was so good everybody forgot about the brain

For those who do the real yoga, will her experience be considered as some kind of accidental Samadhi? It&#39;s fascinating how her experience sounds so the same with the experiences of yogis, only that they go through it with advance levels of meditation while she had to go through a stroke to experience it.

Amazing you are a brilliant woman thank you very much

I am blown away... What a tremendous gift you are Jill, to all of us...❤

I’ve been having an existential crisis and was given this link, I hope this video helps

I feel like I live very right brained, and my life is a dang shambles. I&#39;ve got a lot of love though.

Treasure found after 13 years .

GOOSEBUMPS

Once I went into deep meditation and I saw myself from above and proceeded to explore the universe until I reached the limits and I came out of it. What I saw there was the most amazing experience of my life.

20-22, Mundaka Upanishad 3.1. 1-2, and Svetasvatara Upanisad 4.6-7, speak of two birds, one perched on the branch of the tree, which signifies the body, and eating its fruit, the other merely watching. ... The first bird represents a Jiva, or individual self, or soul.

Bm hedge sir&#39;s recomendation.
The sacred marriage is about the union of the left and right hemisphere. That is hard work but the light at the end. We seemed to be living, collectively, with that possibility.

melodysheep

Many days during the pandemic I didn’t exercise, shower, work or dress..this woman manages to do all mid-stroke 😂 ❤️ She also calls work not 911 😂

What an inspiring discovery in 2021!   Great story!

Read the books of St.Teresa of Avila to discover that lala land.

Everyone loved it👍

May we all learn to step to the right of our left hemisphere!

A real human brain. Savage
Wow!

Thank you Dr Hedge for introducing her to us.

This is my motivational speech whenever I feel I&#39;m lost

I have listened to this several times and have never got bored!! She is an excellent story teller!!

<a href="">12:55</a> my colleague say : woo voo woo vvee 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You Made It Weird With Pete Holmes conversation with Brian Greene brought me here

Superb performance

Amazing!!😍
This just answered my life search for meaning and understanding. Decades I’ve had of guilt and shame unnecessary brain chatter that has taken decades of trials and tribulation only to find myself at the beginning of that loop and I’d go along for another decade of misunderstanding and judgment and that baggage. I watched this and I wish I had known what she learned through this horrible yet beautiful life experience of experiencing one of the most rare and dangerous strokes a human can ever have. What a stroke of insight indeed. I feel like I can finally dump the horrors I’ve experienced and finally grasp the right here right now, through all the self discovery I was begging for.....and books I read and read again and I just couldn’t figure out how it worked. She explained it all so beautifully in 15 minutes. I feel like I can now enjoy and understand why everything happened and have peace in my life. Thank you Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, I’m 14 years late for your TED Talk but I finally showed up. W O W!!!!

BM hedge recommend 🙏

Jesus says that we are to believe on him for our salvation and after that he gives us one commandment to live a long healthy life, love one another as I have loved you.  The kingdom of heaven is within us.  He is right.

My very first Ted x many years ago, and still one of my favourites still

She had a burning question within her. So universe decided to answer her through her own experience. She is indeed an Yogi. 🙏.

This doesn&#39;t strike anyone else as a likely untrue?  How many people having a stroke have extremely accurate memories of what happened during and after the stroke?

when you loose your &quot;I&quot;,

you become &quot;WE&quot;

this is called &quot; NIRVAANA &quot;

Love you with respect

The standing ovation at the end. Incredible. Her vulnerability of being able to tell her story is phenomenal and I love it. The brain is so complex, especially when it comes to mental illness that affects every day of one&#39;s life. To see a brain...A REAL BRAIN...was really cool to me.

the name of this definition is spirit.  the self of human being

Very moving, watching it again after years and it made me move still!

I think we need both. The left hemisphere should be channeled for deciding how to run society in a way that brings about the most prosperity. The left hemisphere is necessary for survival.

I never tire of listening to this. What a Champion of a woman!  I just received her second book and am enjoying it so much already. Thanks Jill. x

“...the we, inside me”.  The most profound and clear description of our beings. I started watching this because I’m fascinated by the science of our brains. What I got out of this is conformation and transcending. Thank you, Jill, for sharing.

NOPE:  Science does not support the notion of dual functionality of the brain.  Recently science has even shown that each of our eyeballs is connected to both sides of our brain.

Came here after BM Hegde Sir&#39;s Recommendation
Sounds like transcendental meditation to me

Thank you for sharing your experience and learning. You are helping me. Thank you and a big, strong hug, with tears in your eyes from emotion.
‘Talk like Ted’ sent me here, what a fantastic and emotional speech, I had tears in my eyes!

What a horrible, typical nasal American voice, not feminine at all. Difficult to listen to.

old liar and false charlatan
Fantastic!!!
The best TED Talk I’ve seen so far! Her experience answered some of my most pressing questions since I dropped Jesus as my god!

This is what Sadhguru experienced on the day of his enlightenment. He experienced everything around as one. This TED talk proves it in scientific way.

I cannot share this with enough people

she is talking rubbish

Rande anyone?

Wonderful
Brilliant! Thank you Jill.

Looking for that phone number sounds exactly like being wasted..

She just described yoga, meditation and what a Hindu way of life makes you experience (if done correctly). Yogis of India have achieved Nirvana for thousands of years. Now she says it and she’s a genius. Good that she experienced it by chance. Welcome to Yoga. Welcome to being Hindu.

This is really inspiring. What&#39;s wrong with the thumbs downers?

Thank you Jill! Your story is so moving and so enlightening! Your experience has made you an enlightened person who can transmit sincerely the experience to others for their own benefit.

&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

This has to be my favorite talk of all times

I think the way that humanity may go through in the near future is this. the beginning is small but the end will be grateful.

Thanx for sharing.

The taboo hip postnatally advise because process microscopically shop till a hypnotic example. shaggy, nervous skin

Insightful lesson. Thank you, Jill!

This is like the death experience of Sri Guru Ramana Maharishi who expounded the thought Who Am I.  Another enlightened being doing angelic work

Don't have a Brazilian?
Simply the most powerful TED talk I&#39;ve seen and that&#39;s a long list. I&#39;m going to send it to everyone I know &lt;3 LET&#39;S choose to be one in our expansiveness and love and change the world, ENERGETICALLY. xo

THIS IS A FANTASTIC STORY. THANK YOU....SO MUCHHHHHH

WOW!

When my father had his first stroke at age 54 it effected his cognitive abilities and personality more than physically. My dad couldn&#39;t explain what it was like inside his mind when it happened, but whatever it was he became a different person. I&#39;m a nurse and I learned so much from him about having a stroke and it completely changed the way I cared for stroke patients. Totally different from how the other nurses did. My dad&#39;s stroke was my stroke of insight in caring for people who have experienced this.

meditation

Honestly the most impactful TED I&#39;ve ever seen. Her book is also INCREDIBLE. One of the most important books I&#39;ve ever read.

I get that she had lost her rationality, but she could have just dialled 911 and saved 45 minutes.

Absolutely awe inspiring!

This is the only TED talk that I cried

It's simply the best lecture I've ever seen in my life. Sensational and fits perfectly with the insights I'm having. Thank you Universe for this opportunity. I can say that I went in, immersed myself in this talk deeply, forgot about everything around it. Thanks.
I&#39;ve been there and it is all that !!♡!!Great description.... Thank you !!♡!!

But how not everyone has brain damage so how do we turn on only the right brain

I watched this video multiple times to get better clarity. I understood that Jill lost the sensation of the boundaries of her body, and so the energies inside and outside her outer skin felt the same to her. This is fine. I also understood that no left brain means no language, no memory, no thoughts. So, the right brain experiences everything (example: the sense perception of sight), but can&#39;t associate with any past experience (due to no left brain). What I didn&#39;t understand is WHY she lost the sensation of the boundaries of her body. She said she experienced the atoms of her arm blending with the atoms of the wall (when she leaned onto the bathroom wall). WHY did she lose the boundary-sensation? Can someone please explain to me?

Despite her lived experience and her passionate and expressive self, can’t help but think of cult leaders who sounded similar. Perhaps for the benefit of her message reaching others, I’d rather just read what she has to say, I suppose. Peace.

The best Ted so far for me

With my MELAS Syndrome on set with a right brain hemisphere Stroke-like episode. MELAS  Syndrome Stroke-like episodes are not blood hemorrhages, they are mineral solidifications such as calcium solidifying.    it made me feel abandoned by the universe. it was the loneliest feeling. i remember reading in Jane Bolte Taylor&#39;s book My Stroke Of Insight about the right brain hemisphere being about the Spiritual aspects of life. i&#39;m not quite sure what she means by &quot;energy.&quot; i understand energy as Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP the energy currency molecule that cells use for kinetic energy when a Phosphate which shoots leaving the Adenosine Diphosphate/ADT behind and an electron is lost when the Phosphate shoots off the ADP. i choose nothing. If we are made of atoms interacting with a world made of even more atoms, chemical reactions are bound to move us. We have no free will. i don&#39;t believe in free will. We have no choices in life we are just chemical  reactions. i exist. And that&#39;s good enough for me. i don&#39;t feel pleasure or enjoyment. but i exist. And that&#39;s okay.

Hence the term &quot;Are you outta your right mind?!&quot;

WoW.!

N I R V A N A.

N I R V A N A.

I’ve watched it many times✨They talk about amazing things✨❤️✨
This video shud get more than a million likes n shares

Who came here from Melodysheep ?

Unfortunately, I feel like people have only moved further from &#39;Nirvana&#39; in recent years..

Superb

Such a powerful and beautiful talk..True essence of Nirvana ❤️

This is exactly what Sidhar&#39;s of India reached together with super consciousness by meditating.

This is one of the most engaging stories I&#39;ve ever heard. She makes me want to go back to school to study neuroscience.

Now that&#39;s what a quality Ted talk is all about..

Inspiring.

Why do I feel I have gone through all this experience...........

Hi am Tarun Vasu, I&#39;d severe brain stroke in left hemisphere due to which my Right side of body paralyzed. Since more than 12 years am unable to walk, talk properly. Right leg is heavily dependent on my Left leg.

Amazing.
This must have been most watched video among ted talks....

12 years ago

This is one of the best speeeches i have ever heard

refer to page 34, Note 18 of The Master and His Emissary after watching this video

Interesting how she keeps her right arm paralised for a moment on the video, maybe to remember how she felt that day.

So the big question is how to be with the right side of our brain....Is there somebody who can help me...🙏🙏🙏🙏

I felt a similar experience when I was delivering my first child under cesarean section.  Euphoric is the word!  I felt like I was one with the coconut tree and when it&#39;s branch swayed, it was like my hands swaying. That&#39;s the kind of expanse I felt. When I regained my consciousness from general anasthesia, tears were flowing and I thanked the doctor.  She thought it was for delivering my child.  Thank you doctor. I think now my left brain had disconnected because of the anaesthesia.

Wow....

This is Advaita - non-duality

She came out of matrix........

Amazing! Wonderful report!!
Just Wow!

my question is how do we choose that? It sounds like the stroke initiated the transition no her choice.

It was Indeed, an Idea Worth spreading !Blessed women !

Itent thega ane zoology class ano, arelum onne paraj taayo 🤔🤔

Her story always makes me cry, i want to go to the right side. Ayahuaska did that for me

Who is here after watching BM hegde&#39;s speech

NIRVANA this word comes from india from our great sages (scientists),way long back they had given directions and methods to attain nirvana and explained everything about it ,veda is indeed the greatest and utmost reality needs to be learned and explored by present generation.

waw. just waw.

Imagine the scientific knowledge it took to fix her brain physically. Imagine the brain knowledge it took to fix her brain mentally.

Very fortunate soul to feel nirvana on the attack of left Brian ....

2021 Still can&#39;t get enough

Everyone, please google this: &quot;jill bolte taylor psychology today myths&quot; you might learn something actually useful instead of this rubbish.

when I&#39;m on acid I call it loopy land and in it, I always say it&#39;s &quot;peculiar&quot; too lmao.

Wonderful.Experience described so nicely.Could connect to Yogic explanation .Left brain is logic. Right brain is creativity which can happen only in present.So well explained by my MASTER.

1 cent only. Very dramatic but this is not in line with Nirvana or enlightenment.1. Consciousness has absolutely nothing to do with the brain. It is not an object of perception, it is perception itself. Just because left hemisphere goes silent, you won&#39;t feel silence.2. 

&quot;I have found Nirvana&quot;. Dramatic expression. Not possible. Nirvana is not an object to be found by a subject and Nirvana is permanent. What she probably means is a state of oneness accidentally caused by brain fluctuations and then you snap back to “I am”.  All we can say here is that her brain in short energy supply,  saw something different from the material world, cannot grasp it, and is branding it as the highest experience there is. There have been many recorded instances where people on drugs/LSD/such have had such experiences of not being the body, floating, body atoms merging into other atoms etc. Because of the immensity of the expression in the video and especially because it is by a neuroscientist, this talk has taken off. If a normal meditator from Himalayas would have said this without &quot;I did not get any stroke - this is just plain and simple that we are the cosmic absolute&quot;, that would have become a normal talk.

(min: <a href="">15:20</a>) &#39;There is no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body&#39;. Amazing feeling, no need to wait for a stroke; meditation can take us there.  Thanks Jill.

Any helpful links to support this? Not doubting, I just want to learn more. And every google search results in horoscope style &quot;What does it mean when you&#39;re left brain dominant?&quot;

Indian sages have gone into the exact stage of what she said as niravana long ago and fact is that still now there is a way to get into that wholesomeness The way to get into that stages are written in Tamil and it&#39;s difficult to interpret those meanings

One of outstanding Tedtalk, I have ever heard off.. It was so engaging since the first minute of her talk. Just Awesome!!!

I love this Ted talk so much but I just realized she sounds exactly like Missy from Big Mouth

MEDITATION is our liberation. Let go.

There is a book called Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, written by Betty Edwards. Basically, she teaches that we need to step into the right hemisphere mode that Jill Taylor speaks of, in order to draw realistic pictures of what is around us. Read it and experiment with it. Drawing is a wonderful activity to shift consciousness.

We are not the life force of the universe, God or Yahweh is through Jesus Christ.  We are not perfect beings but God is perfect.  The only place of Nirvana is through Jesus Christ and in the presence of God.  Don&#39;t replace faith in God with humanism.  I feel for her story as I have personally was a cancer patient.  My pray is the Jill find perfect peace in Jesus.

If anybody wonders how to get to &quot;nirvana&quot;, it&#39;s meditation!

Great

WOW....truly enlightening and heartfelt!

She seems to me as if she is describing death, while she is alive. If only I could be peaceful without having a stroke or die.

this is really morbid

Read her book. Sounds EXACTLY and I mean identical to a psilocybin mushrooms trip. Expanded awareness where everything becomes one with no concept of anything being separate to its surroundings causing a loss of self and ego. Same with the concept of &quot;time&quot; the past, present and future become one, a string of the same now, even to her senses becoming amplified and reality looking 2D as she discribes in her book. Sounds identical

Why does she reminds me of Hange Zoe? Lmao only weebs might understand

Love you.

Gracias 🙏🏻
Dual or whole brain thinkers must be rare.  I can use both sides equally and choose which side or whole brain thinking to make decisions on any given day.   That comes from practice to combine the whole brain to be as one unit.

Fantastic.
What a beautiful woman!

Ok

Very interesting, I just watched Fight Club.

So she became a Buddhist?

This talk is so good I&#39;ve come back multiple times over the past years to re-watch it.

nice video

A shocking and beautiful experience..... Wow

Is my is my mother goose club out.

I had same experience in my mediations. Exactly. The whole universe fits in my little body, my body is a mirror of the whole universe when we let go of all the labels words concepts.....What this tells us is that retarded people, dementia people CAn Still See Clarity just it does not come through...their is a full cognizance no matter what happens to us.

the brain looks like the intestines...processing...info...electricity...

Those who choose Allah like those who choose Dajjal ignore.
Who chooses Allah SWT like.
schizophrenia,psyshiatry,hemorrhage, right brain me,left brain iam part of universe,i have empathy for all,iamm atoms and enegy and i can communicate with the world,listen tovoice of soul,energy connections.

Love you.

This is incredible.  She is incredible. Her explanation is so beautiful and easily understood. From someone who doesn&#39;t understand the human brain as much as some, she made me understand and relate to her entire experience. Miss Ted Talk lady, I&#39;m thankful you survived this stroke and maintained your intelligence all while delivering education to those who want to listen. I came across this video years ago and still watch / share it with others. I wish more people were educated on strokes. YouTube friends, does she have other videos? Id love to listen to her more.Also, Ted talk lady , come to Shambhala anytime. Wed love to have you

He says everything correctly, so it is. We are consciousness-energy, and we project our own world. In order to know ourselves as true, we must stop the internal dialogue of the left hemisphere, which is used to divide and evaluate.

God bless this person

Talk like TED??
She said we can choose sides, but I feel like a prisoner to the left
Harmony comes with meditation, not medication.

Did anyone else come here through the book “Dare to be different” by Pedro Superti?
This is seriously the most inspirational talk I’ve ever seen. I do NOT say that lightly!

According to English psychiatrist Dr. R. D, . Laing, &quot; Schizophrenia is a mystic experience.&quot;. He has written a book DIVIDED SELF.

She definitely did DMT 😂❤️

I think I recently heard that the brains hemispheres aren&#39;t very different they are just left brain controls left arm, left eye, left leg,etc.

Dear Jill, your humor, and your very lovely detailed story along with your bravery give all of us hope to live our life without fear and with joy.

When I was in elementary school, my Dad worked at a very small local hospital and got me about 1/4 of a human brain to take to school for “Show and Tell.” Obviously that would never happen now, but it was really cool, other than the fact that my teacher thought it was gross 😃

I hate that intro.

A month ago this type of stroke occurred to my wife. This is the first moment I’ve been able to understand what happened to her. Thank you so much.

Awesome

By reading a book, I have the opportunity to hear a tremendous story. Impressive!
Absolutely brilliant! So true and what an amazing gift you have shared with the world. Thank you!

Superb.

Incredible!❤
Meditation does the same.

She talks exactly like xavir renegade angel at points

All i can do is cry watchin this...it&#39;s definitely real

this sounds like she took some acid on accident.

Incredible. 👏👏👏
Wonderful
Just take LSD in your times off and get back to work with your left brain so people don&#39;t die.

And thats why we must do hijama at least once in a year

Classic lecture.

okay but why am i crying?

Moving talk! just discovered it, blessed to have watched it! what a powerful message... if you can hear it!

it&#39;s the first time that I like Ted Talk

Awesome. Gratitude for everything.

this lady sounds like she took about 6 tabs of acid and forgot

fatboyslim

yikes it must&#39;ve gotten really cold in here or something cause ive got CHIILS

<a href="">16:08</a> finding peace. This is so powerful. We have the intrinsic ability to choose to use our right hemispheres for healing ourselves and spreading good to the world. Thank you.

Absolutely fascinating and amazing. Well done and inspirational.

I have assigned this TEdTalk through the years to a handful of high school students under my tutelage whom I felt could truly connect with what this woman is saying about both the human condition, who we are, and what we ultimately do in our lives, and one of those students graduated this year (2020) from Notre Dame, in neuroscience (and this student is unable, still, to legibly print her name on a piece of paper as one would expect, due to her being profoundly dyslexic) -- Go Irish!

Hundreds of brains reaction to witnessing the dead brain on the stage: &quot;eeeuuugh&quot;

I don&#39;t buy this for a moment

Wow

extraordinary woman! so grateful to hear your message! Thank you to have come back from Nirvana to spread the word of love and peace xx

I mean wow
Nirvana....Nirvana....a bow to ancient Indian yogis who coined and found this state of consciousness...10 k years before....

We journeyed with you mam in your blisfull journey ...👏👏👏👏

Wow how much involved explanation .. and the vast diff between the two parts of our brain ..

insightful

&quot;Cast your net to the right&quot;

So basically there are 2 of you.I guess we should find a balance between the two, i guess both sides of the brain are there for good reason

Madam the experience is really marvelous. if you really know what&#39;s happening, avoid this message.If you want to know more contact to this person to know the truth.thirugnananandha@<a href="">gmail.com</a>He is a saint who felt and feeling it at present.So if you want more guidance contact him.ThanksAswin9677089937

Amazing lady ..
I always thought the part of the mind that understands past and future was the default mode network. Cause of lsd and how it affects me

is this video glitchy for anyone else?

I&#39;m so excited to have came across someone like JANET WILMAS as my  binary options trade account manager. She is so amazing.I came across some testimonies on how she helped so many people,I contacted her and after some few conversation I gave her a try and I invested $10000 and after 7days I earned $58000. Ever since then,it has been awesome trading with her. you can connect with her on Instagram @janetwilmas_fx or WhatsApp +13479789821

The whole time I was like okay so this drugs do

As someone who has also had a near death experience, being declared 60% dead, I highly relate to her experience. Brought tears to my eyes!

This video is a gift! Thanks! 💕

Now I want a stroke

one of the best ever.

This is the very first TED talk I had ever heard. Roughly a decade ago. This is still so very gripping. So profound. So physiologically relatable. The human mind is an unknown ❤

I can never dar to hold human brain with that courage. No way

THE BEST TED TALK EVER.

We is WellnessI is illness.

Enchanting!!!!!I saw it again after years and it is even more enchanting 😋🌹
This video, this experience... is just... amazing!I have no words for this video...Thank you for sharing this with us!

Wow amazing

My brother suffered a Massive Stroke at 59 years old, Aphasia, left side of his body is paralyzed. He was an accomplished Pilot! He’s at an Assisted Living, in quarantine because of Covid19....its horrible!

<a href="">4:07</a> &amp; <a href="">4:54</a> if you&#39;re here from <b>Ode to the Brain!</b> by Symphony of Science

Wow this is a life changing Ted talk

Is she high

left side stroke: become a uselles hippie-Now when you have a right side Stroke:  &quot;congratulations, you rule the worldand the planet is a new utopia and everyone loves you as their leader and most efficient human being in history&quot;

SO this is what lefty hippies  live everyday. including the lack of verbal and cognitive capacity. LOL

🙏😍 thank you so so much, your words are water shower  my spiritual practise. 🙏🥰

a stroke seems to be a small price to pay for salvation...

This is extraordinary! Actually experiencing the lobes!

So far this also one of the most moving and emotional talks for me. I as well had a an injury like a stoke where I hit one of those concrete poles around a gas pump after having a grand mal seizure from my epilepsy, which I had just been dx 2 years before. It not only shredded the left half of my face but was left with a tbi. After a couple months of healing the face thing, realized now I have to start relearning who and what I was! That was 15 years ago and still to this day I&#39;m working to gain what I had lost, yet move on to realize and accept the new me, and know that life goes on

I needed to hear this

I have seen this video multiple times in the last 12 years, and every time it brings tears of joy to be reminded of who we really are. Thank you again, Jill Bolte Taylor for being part of my right-brain interrupt - inspiring my left brain to shine and become the light I intended to be in this world. Namaste!

Excellent blend of spirituality in pathology

This is what the Indian sanatan dharma says , this is what Krishna told, this is what Buddha told, this is what Indian yogis told. I&#39;m happy  ma&#39;am is happy and healthy

7 minutes in...More people need to have strokes like this.

I heard this Ted Talk back in 2008 and was amazed. I guess this is the tenth time i rewatch it. It is by far the best Ted Talk I have heard so far. I can recommend this interview with Oprah. It gives a broader perspective.<a href="">

The beautiful journey from&quot; I&quot; towards &quot;we&quot;...

Just WOW!!!! Amazing! God bless you Jill!

She makes it sound so interesting you might almost be tempted to hope for a similar stroke.

Wow! Gotta see it!
The description she gives of the effects of the stroke are very similar to those experienced by people who have had a &#39;near death experience&#39; (NDE) Possible research  opportunity here perhaps?

More like a religious sermon but insightful all the same.

Eloquent and incredibly insightful. I learned a great deal from this

You are a miracle. You came back because you were meant to be here to save my life. I have schizophrenia. I am also an aspiring astrophilosophihisicysics or something like that. A wierd looking thing. You just said so for word persicely what I have been working on for decades to prove. You are living proof. I can explain scientifically what happened to you. You are my savior. Everyone other then my teachers thinks I&#39;m crazy. I love you. I changed my mind. I&#39;m not ever going to kill myself <a href="">now.no</a>  way. You saved me. Thank you. kozichkathleenann@<a href="">gmail.com</a>

up !muslim&#39;s prayers, if done right, brings them 5 times/day to their &quot;la la land&quot; ? Good presentation.

Wow, unbelievable how this happening truly moves Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor (and me).  The experience she describes is the same one you find in the Holy Scriptures of all the great souls/ avatars. There is another reality beyond the reality that we take for granted. However, there is a better way to achieve such a state, as I discovered after 25 years of meditation. My sincere thanks for this beautiful talk .

This is very deep that can make you think in a border sense about how important the brain one of our organs is and how it controls everything we do.

by far the best tedTALK ever  thanks for sharing...

Thinking you&#39;re speaking when you aren&#39;t really speaking, the lack of ability to comprehend numbers or know what they mean, losing the ability to think in words...this has me wondering if my K2 overdose might have in reality caused a stroke. Except I experienced those things nearly every time long before the night I wound up in the hospital, so I&#39;m not really sure, since it&#39;s impossible I was having a stroke every day for 2 months.

I’ve encountered this idea before and it really resonates with me; that things we callously categorize as mental illnesses and medical emergencies could very possibly be glimpses of alternate states of being and layers/perspectives of reality we are blind to and can not comprehend in our stifled state.

This is what is taught by YOGA

cried

I want to take mushrooms with this chick

Wow!This lady is Amazing,such a inspiration to me,Thank you so much for sharing your story,very amazing👍👍👍

She’s an energy bean? Is that like a magic bean?

“This is so cool! How many brain scientists get to study their own stroke!?!?” That is a thought I can totally see myself having if that ever happened to me. As a biologist I feel heard right now.

sounds like Dmt trip
This being or &quot;spirit&quot; is absolutely brilliant, I&#39;ve watched so many ted talk and I can&#39;t think which is my favourite but if any1 were to ask me this is the first one id talk about..but this is not about favourites. Her ability to tell a share an experience is monumental I remember the first time watching this even when I re-visited, it was like I felt her pain,her every emotion,her thoughts I can&#39;t even explain it. Its as if we were connected you don&#39;t want her to stop talking and although I don&#39;t fully understand my right brain or how to harness it&#39;s potential &quot;I mean I struggle with meditation&quot; does it even work or are people just buying into it, I have to say it was insightfulFor that thank you Jill💛

I saw this video in TEDx Sanaa 2012 and  I couldn&#39;t find it ever since.. however I remember that this talk changed me deeply.. it is worth spreading

Absolutely beautiful awesome 👏. My son killed him self schizophrenia😞 and as I hope you all can not experience the suffering of a mother... looking for something to help me understand I found this wonderful woman ♥️peace...  🦋

One of the best Ted talks I have ever heard.

The end message before everyone claps means :She wants more people to stay in the present moment and embrace  this energy/senses when she refers to the right hemisphere.

Hahahaha...what a wonderful presentation...an insight of experience laced with humour!

mr.spock hit the dislike button

My right hemisphere was cheering hearing this, but my left hemisphere said &quot;pff, what an emotional garbage&quot;

Awesome testimony of our existence  💕

That was beautiful! I have her book ❤️🙏🏼 what a brave soul!

I wonder what would&#39;ve happened had the haemorrhage been on the other hemisphere.

She is a good actors well she is Acting she is doing it more then it happened she made it all up....because it was so detailed people may not had noticed it

Dr.Jill Bolte  Taylor has made some very fascinating revelations from her real life experience. Indeed human beings need to make good balance of left brain and right brain. Then the world shall be a better place to live. Thanks Ted for sharing this insightful video. Best wishes and Regards

İ feel so lucky to be among these 55B lucky intellectual people who liked this precious speech.

I keep coming back to this, it&#39;s just so moving and interesting how she describes a stroke from the inside!

I could imagine n see everything she uttered..... felt magical.

sound like a dmt trip

This explains a lot of stuff in religions 😂 (visions, prophets, saints, gurus, etc)

BORING !!

<a href="">12:46</a> heartless basterd, lol

Very very beautiful speech. Nothings sounds better than things that come from deep inside. Thank so much great Doctor !

She basically describes an LSD Trip.

I&#39;m confused by her shift from painful noise and light to expansive joy around <a href="">15:00</a>.  Her left brain was cycling in and out?

Somebody tell her that was her soul she experienced.

expansive. now.

Her words are simple yet profound.  We are born without ego. And as we age, most of us develop an imbalance between these &#39;sides&#39; of our brains.  We think of ourselves as separate from the world.  We worry about our mortality.  If can you let go (or at least minimize) your ego, then you are truly free.  This is something to reach through much effort and repetition, resetting your neurochemistry. It may take years through means such as meditation, but the journey is a worthy and beautiful one.

Sounds just like a psychedelic experience.  Speaking for a friend.

Hi, this is Adriana and I have an assignment for my critical thinking teacher to comment on a topic and some things that I noticed on it. Taylor used the ostrich bias because she was ignoring negative information about the stroke. She was just being positive and talking about the good things about the stroke that she got. For example, Taylor could mention that a stroke would make you not be able to taste things as well as you did before, so flavors may not be as obvious or strong, get a salty, bad, or metallic taste in your mouth and lose your sense of taste completely. Not to only focus on the bright side of it just to touch the audience.	Taylor didn’t mention any other expert since she was an expert on the topic; however, if it was possible for her to bring another scientist to support her arguments it would be great or even to show some images or video of the event to make it more credible; however, the presentation of a real human brain and explaining the functions of it made the presentation better and more interesting. 	Besides these little things that I commented on, I thought that the presentation was very good and I wish to hear more about her because of the way that she presents makes the audience feel connected.

Such an awesome storyteller

Wow, how can she sublime her pain to laugh!

I had a very similar experience with LSD. Not saying people should do it but when I did, it was a very pivotal and spiritual experience.

This is what happens if you have half of your brain missing.A few very good observations, but a person with both hemispheres intact certainly looks a bit more human. To me.It&#39;s a question of taste, obviously.

Wow! One of the most emotional TEDs I've seen! It reminded me of the book Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow by Kahneman..👏🏻
One love !! One life !! Amazing speach !!! Good job !! Please, keep spreading the truth !! And never stop!! We have to wake the rest people up !!! 😍

This is what enlightenment is.... This is what India has been saying for millennia....

What an amazing spirit she is! Thank you, doctor!

Amazing
so weed

I cried listening to her.. her thoughts and language are so powerful

what a trip man

Metaviglioso grazie
subtitles too fast
I think she just accidentally did some acid

thank you!

this sounds awfully close to a acid trip, curious

this is one of the best TED talks I&#39;ve seen

This is my most favorite video of all videos ever produced and i watch it often.

must be the shrooms lol

What an amazing video !!!!!!!!!!

Disgusting but interesting

Wow, this was so beautiful speech!

Brilliant. It&#39;s interesting to listen to her experience

I can listen to this talk again and again. Amazing analysis of the brain and explanation how the left and right hemispheres work.

12 years later and her PASSION IS UNMATCHED

This was my Psilocybin trip.

Most powerful sentence from her&quot; We are the life-force power of the universe.&quot;

<a href="">18:00</a>  What I&#39;m thinking/feeling.

So... who&#39;s brain is that ?It&#39;s a pretty intimate part of one&#39;s body, I hope they asked first !

Who on EARTH would push a thumb down button after hearing about her experience?

I seem to be an outlier here... but I don&#39;t get the fascination with this video. The story of having a stroke is interesting, and she conveys this in a humorous and technical way that is both entertaining and insightful. That part of this is great. But as for any deeper meaning about right-brains and our spiritual selves and being one with our fellow-man and all that stuff, I don&#39;t get it. She was able to experience Nirvana because she had a blood clot in her left hemisphere, apparently allowing her to live in the &quot;now&quot; without the clutter of language and reflections on the past and future. But for those who don&#39;t have blood clots (and who don&#39;t do mushrooms apparently), what the heck does this mean?  I have never heard of anybody having a switch to turn off a hemisphere (again -- putting aside drugs).  If someone takes cocaine, then they have tons of energy and everything seems great and they feel powerful and all that good stuff, but I&#39;m not sure that we can extrapolate anything from that experience to everybody who does not take cocaine. If the message is that we can somehow change our lives and our perspective on things, then I&#39;m not sure how one does this without going through her experience.  Again, interesting story, educational about hemispheres of the brain, educational about strokes, funny at times, entertaining... but failing to see the deeper message here. Sorry - probably too wrapped up in a left brain here.....

good

<a href="">2:39</a> Is that Chino from Deftones?

Was I the only one that started crying

The function of the brain is occupied. Two hemispheres are separate but connected to work for the human body. Her energy is so strong and that helped her overcome her sickness. I&#39;ve felt that through meditation, the key is to find the right platform to feel that incredible feeling.

She is such an amazing women and beautiful  talker,  where is she now

Hi, i know a dependable service to enhance your views naturally for thousend is at 1.53 so the service is called - <b>RazorViews</b>

Wow. No words can describe the women&#39;s passion and experience. We can learn from this...

I love this Jill..thank you for sharing with the world. My own experiences of over 20+ years of studying and practicing yoga and mediation and the energy within and around us has opened me fully to this understanding and experience of who we are.. &#39;Spiritual&#39;, energetic beings connected to source energy and immense love and consciousness.  We are as human beings so much more than our minds and bodies and this realisation is fully possible in our human experience through becoming (more) conscious and aware.When we learn to observe the mind, raise our energy and let go fully of the mental chatter... a new reality is known...

I have a few family and relative members have strokes including my father. Take care of a stroke patient isn&#39;t easy. It requires lot of work and patience. My dad had stayed in bed for ten years before he died. Until I watched this clip, I have never realized they feel or experience through the process. This video helps me to be more sensitive  and understanding around stroke patients in the future.

EVALUATING TED TALKS

Thank you for that she found the key of happiness despite she had a strok💖🌌🌠

Wow. Just WOW !

Found this video from a post on Reddit about Steve Job’s last words. And found that post from a comment on YouTube from a video that randomly popped into my YouTube feed. Grateful for the internet. Grateful I found this. Grateful for life. Grateful for God.

the fact that she just explained what it was like to be in the presence of God, in the kingdom of heaven, Is very powerful.she wasn&#39;t even trying. God Is Real. God Bless.

I have watched this so many times and I am still moved each time I see it. Amazing. What a story. What a message. Thank you!

This is why magic shrooms are so illegal, the powers that be dont want us to realize our own immortality, they would lose power over us.

I learned a lot about myself studying neuroscience.  I added some screenshots from this video in my neuroscience page. I hope it is ok. <a href="">

Really deep

This video&#39;s title should&#39;ve been my LSD experience

Basically it is a description of a psychedelic experience

The subs have terrible desynchronization...
Im watching this for the second time now 12 years after my first time because she is so amazing with her experience and I love brain science.

I watch this presentation several times, every time I can learn something new.

I have read her book and I can honestly say that it is fascinating. I also do TM and because of what I read in her book I recognise the same state that she described. When you do TM you effectively quiet down the left-hemisphere of your brain and you begin to experience the nirvana that she describes. Her book is well worth reading - even after watching this video because it gives a lot more detail about what happened and the strange things that she had to learn - things that we just take for granted that we don&#39;t realise we actually had to learn it at a very young age.

God bless u

and then it EXPLODES INTO THIS ENORMOUS COLLAGE

How about keeping the iron artificially alive? And use it as data?
Lady, you have a gift, you are an incredible stand up comedian. If you ever learn how to bottle that nirvana stuff I&#39;ll take a bottle.

Anyone else going through an awakening right now and are questioning whether it’s really a brain hemorrhage?

There is reason why people did DMT &amp; continue to use psychedelics to connect to earth. They knew

This and more is what and how I felt on LSD. Take a tab or two and hope you get a &#39;ego-death.&#39; what she is saying cannot be experienced by any words. It is much deeper. It is a feeling that she has experienced that she will never be able to experience normally.

Greetings to those who talk like Ted
Why is she exalting the symptoms of a damaged and faulty brain?

i was born with a shortened tendent in my neck, i did not go to a surgery but had excersises to my neck, by spining my head, left to right, later on by the help of the internet i found out that my spining of a head while i slept was some kind of a condition, i am 40 years old now and i have been spining my head for 40 years, i could not go to sleep without doing that, it would relax me.. when i was 25 years old i started to have halucinations before sleep when i would start to spin my head so i somewhat curbet that head spinning compulsion, it was al mess of visual things right from the start of spining, and in the proces of doing that, that something weird happened, from age 25 to about 27 i had in my drems gone to the place that jill is describing, she is describing the place i went to to the letter it was the same experience, i have visited nirvana for 5 times and it was like this, first there is this existance like some vertical plane, a vertical line, then there is the quickening, a qickening by my words is a place where my chonchious experiences existance in a light fast visual almost sickening speed, and after that there is another vertical plane into witch the conschience mind goes, and in that place there is no i, no me yust conschiousness and it starts to grow into the ifinite like a whale being and growing into a endless sea of existence.and by instinct i knew the place was the truth of all being, it was not needed to think or to reason, it was yust the truth of the place that i could comprehend, so i would wake up and i would not know what it was so i ignored it, it was all hapeniong before there was internet in my life so i cold not google it, stuff was before google, it hapened 5 times after that and then i kept on existing, i tried to explain the experience to some of my closest aquaintances but they did not understand what i was talking about, so i kept it in the back of my mind and went with my life. i must note this fealing, every time when i got back from that place there was an unbelieveable fealing that i got kicked out.i did not bother wit that much, and  few years after i got internet, i was using it and something strange hapened, i had a dream, i was on a plane, pilot and the stuardeses where all singing a tune that was owerwhelming, something melodical and great, and thej where encoureging me to make my own melody, and silense arose, and i was triying  to make my own melody, and stuf that was coming from my mouth was pathetic. it was tha most terible melody on the world, and then the pilot and stuardeses started to sing with me, to intermingle their song with my song, they showed me what i was, and the song was so powerful that i awoke criying struck with emotion.they have shoven me that i am a part of something incredible and my participation in that means everithing to the melody of existance.next dream was the same pilot leading me to the dark cave, and when i was to enter the cave he stopes me and sais you are not ready, and after that someone shouts not in my ear but in my mind the word SAMSARA!!!! it was so loud that i could not forget it after i woke up, i have never heard a word like that, so i went to google to search it, and fel into the rabbit hole.

The most I got from this video, don&#39;t mean to be mean, being so close to someone who went through brain problems made me appreciate having a healthy brain and plan on making less excuses when bacon vs broccoli is placed in front me. The part with the nirvana and transcendence of body was nice but not very nice.

Dang this lady must really like Kurt Coabin.

Thank you  from the bottom of my heart ...I  see this seven months after my father passed  away  after  suffering a stroke . I wish i knew this  at that time , but  I also   now know what he felt , who he was in those three months of stroke , what was healing him  and  what finally stopped  healing him . It was energy  around him .

Gracias!
Wildly oversimplified stories about the brain. Compelling but unfortunately incorrect.

This is my all-time favorite TED talk. Idk how many times I’ve viewed this over the years. Fascinating!

I LOVE this talk. I&#39;ve watched it many times since I first heard of it many years ago - at least  8 years ago, maybe longer. I make it a point to find and watch it. I think it&#39;s the best TED Talk, too, as others have also said.

Did she survive?

🎵A real energy bean, and a real hero🎵

Oh for the time when TED Talks were about science lectures and sharing innovation with the public. Now its motivational bullshit and comedy sketches.

Shroomer

As a software engineer who has had out of body experiences I would say the brain is a computer and our conscience is the software and data stored and executed on the brain/computer.  Our conscience is connect through light energy to the universe which is the ultimate internet and cloud so when our bodies and brains or computer die our conscience doesn&#39;t.  It&#39;s like your conscience or data is constantly in synch with the cloud/internet (universe) therefore it can be restored to a new computer (body/brain) or . reincarnation.   This is how the universe works.

I saw one of the best video of my life ..

we have every day many opportunity to transform the world around us, moment by moment. God is very Good!

I’m studying the Buda and his ideas, when I remembered about this talk. It’s the meditations mind that he talks about.

Great TED talk!!! I have been looking for this for months since I heard David Icke describe this wants experience,but he didn&#39;t give her name. I hope one day soon,they figure out how to excise traumatic memories experiences from our brains.She just started describing how we can choose how we are in this world,and now I&#39;m <a href="">crying.So</a> beautiful.

this woman, who i have been following for years becayse if her sacrifice and generosity toward her brother and her quest to find a cure for his illness, has experienced some form of euphoria, along with the usual blurred vision, tactile displacement, and the profound sense of mortality. Sorry, that&#39;s all i see.

Nonsense

Dang

That&#39;s pretty similar to my acid experience.

what

The book was informative but this talk is not a scientist speaking but a charismatic New Age guru spreading her &quot;feel good&quot; message ...step into your right brain and Nirvana becomes your reality... seriously, this sounds like a good LSD trip. These right brain left brain distinctions where taught in the 70s but brain science has come a long way since then, it turns out to be much more complicated than Taylor makes it sound. I notice from the comments how unbelievably gullible so many people are, it&#39;s disappointing.

Academics. Having a stroke....best ring work and let them know I wont be in.

Great

I have no words. I&#39;m crying like a baby. I can only say THANK YOU!

That&#39;s called smoking weed

we need to invent a device to augment the right hemisphere and feel ourselves.

I give you brains!

When she describes all that stuff happening to her right before the stroke, I experienced a LOOOT of that when taking psychedelic drugs.

So beautiful and brilliant. It gives me chills every time.

The mysterious ways of life have sent this blissfully deep and difficult teaching her way--I&#39;m eternally grateful that you would have survived JillMany blessing on your path to spreading this truth, you have deeply imprinted my mind

There are many ancient civilisations on the world who have mastered this cross without damaging themselves. I am not talking about medium devices like mescalito, LSD, DMT etc. They have the wisdom of 5000 years of experience and they have been trying to tell these to scientists for 500 years. All the sick system of ours has to be reformed according to this wisdom and we need politicians with the balls for this or the other way is each person has to take their own responsibility for this.

So basically she was describing how it feels like after smoking a blunt.

Thanks,  beautifully performed poetry from the scientist.  I believe that God (Allāh ) created the human brain so powerful as to go through such experiences/events.

<a href="">14:35</a> as she says &quot;stimulation coming in felt like pure pain&quot; - a bright camera flashed

Sadhguru :)

Hi,,

Scooter b. Mean.

I love love love you. This caliber is what I expect of Ted talks.

Great

The reflection that I learn is that having two very different sides in the brain, using them at their own moments and not depending on only one of them is important and necessary, on the one hand the analysis and management of data in the objective world and on the other another creativity and emotions in the subjective world.Thanks to Jill Bolte and Ted for sharing this experience of consciousness and learning
It´s a gorgeous insight. I wish many more people would watch and understand.... It´s all inside of us, in each of us.

She just described the breakthrough Psychedelic experience as well 👍❤️🙏

One of the best Ted talks.

AMAZING

I like this girl and lala land

Outstanding Insightful Video Must See whole Video.

I will be sitting on the right side of my father cast all your fish net to the right side of the boat!Lucifer the left brain hemisphere Consciousness Jesus is the right brain hemisphere consciousness

She&#39;s so, soo into her speech... I felt her speech deep down in my heart. Oh God....

Wonderful
so no afterlife?
This is one of my favorite all-time videos. I use it to help people understand what it is to leave the ego-identity and become the ONe-ness. Such a great and vivid explanation. I have done Ayahuasca to discover I am the Life-force power of the universe, at One with all that is. At this stage of our evolution, we are still needing these big pushes to remember our Source reality. Great hope for our lives.

How utterly beautiful and terrifying.

This is a beautiful talk, and amazingly applicable to my work! Thank you! Dr. Jung wrote about these divergences between left brain and right brain all of his life, but without benefit of stroke, perhaps he missed some valid ways to talk about what he was writing about.

So beautiful!!

Wonderful information and sentiments. How can a person intentionally activate the right hemisphere more and give the left hemisphere a break?

Magnificent!❤❤❤
It seems she experienced that there is indeed a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;. Many neuroscientists will reduce these sorts of experiences to neuroanatomy alone but I think she is hinting that she now understands that there is something beyond this.

I saw this talk when it was released. then few more times later. and its still giving me insights to this day when I watched it after so many years ! can&#39;t thank enough to Jill Bolte Taylor 😊👌👍💟

This highlighted something that remains in my subconscious all the time that is kind of a scary idea… That is, that my past, my total, collected, memories and knowledge… Really the same-knowledge is just a memory of something you learned… All of that taken together is what is “me“… And what I mean when I say “ my life“. It’s just memories. Having the enormity of something like this reduced to some electrical impulses or electro chemical processes that reside in a lump of grey jelly with a cord hanging down from it… Tissue… An organ of the body… that,  in its entirety, is so fragile, volatile, and subject to loss, so that one would worry at the same level as they would if something important were stored in an un- backed-up, flash memory, or random access memory, dependent on a single source of power to remain active, all the while knowing that such a device is the only place where this information exists and if lost is unrecoverable, And finally, that there is only one “player” available that can read this information. At the instant of death, and the cessation of brain activity, all of these data evaporate in an instant. Forever gone, and quite possibly, having nothing more than a block of granite stuck in the dirt to even claim that such a body of data ever existed, with perhaps a name and a couple of dates being the only shared bit remaining. Is it possible that a patch of disturbed dirt, and presence of a granite stone block with some writing on it represents the most significant difference that was made on the planet that you ever were? On the day that the very last person on earth that ever knew you reaches the same position, then unless you have done something that continues to exist into the future that your name is attached to, then it’s hard to imagine how more “gone“ a person could be. This is the reality of one who does not believe that there is an immortal soul or whatever word you want to use to describe the part of a human being that remains after death.

Very inspirational ♡♡
She sounds like squilvia from that one spongebob episode

geezus, why does watch <a href="">2:43</a> plus hurts my teeth?

So how many neurosurgeons has had this experience; I count 2 now

Well it ain&#39;t brain surgery :)

Brilliant and captivating

Still one of my all time favorites

I achieved this by accident, if you exhaust the left brain it shuts off and the right brain takes over... Autogenics is a good method to reconnect with right brain hemisphere

This piece turned from humor to spiritual in no time. She is pervasive that&#39;s for sure.

<a href="">19:00</a>Does anyone know the name of the song at the end?

She has seen

tripp of a lifetime

I really understood how important and excellent ``shokuiku'' is in Japan. Also, I would like to see continued dietary education, rather than just food education.
Very captivating description of first person stroke experience.  Brain display (with corpus callosum severed) was unnecessary gore for uneducated public consumption. So you recovered. God bless you. But what do we choose?  I don’t get the question.

I choose both.

heard a snippet from NPR and had to watch the whole Ted Talk. Extremely interesting

I see 1.4K thumbs down and cannot for the life of me comprehend it. She is a phenomenal storyteller, thinker, human. I found this entirely captivating and thought-provoking and FASCINATING. Bravo!

I have shown this video to some people and they overall don&#39;t get the depth of the explanations this woman is giving us. It may sound really pseudoscientific or too much spiritual, some of the peopme I have shown this video to, say she is telling something it may not be true. If you have really understood what that nirvana stage was, not as a silliness but as a really deep, true, and huge thing... congratulations ... im so frustrated showing this video 😓😓😓😓😭😭😭😭

sounds like she had a 5MEO DMT experience

Amazing
This is magic mushroom effeckt :) I know...

You inspired me

Salvia, somehow, is and IS NOT chill..

Woooow that was amazing

Amazing.
WAIT A MINUTE (<a href="">16:48</a>) &quot;WE ARE THE LIFE FORCE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE!&quot; THAT HIT ME DEEP! I COULD SEE HER ENERGY AROUND HER BODY AS SHE DESCRIBED LALA LAND. WOW WOW WOW. LIFE CHANGING

Vedanta
Found myself clapping at the screen with tear-filled eyes at the end. Definitely an idea worth spreading, thank you!!!

we are energy beans

I had a stroke in my left side of my brain on November 9, 2011. Today I am 72, so here&#39;s hoping I&#39;ll survive the recovery of my stroke.

Watching this while high. I&#39;m an energy bean.

Does anybody kind of want to experience a stroke?

STANDING OVATION!!!Absolutely loved this talk!            🍃💕🍃

Thank you.

A very intellectual and spirited human being.

This reminds me after my brain injury when my Mom called she sounded like the example Jill explained.

Do u guys know other people like her on youtube ? omg, i loved it

david icke sent me here!

This women is a bliss. I&#39;m listening to it like 3rd time n will keep listening to it everytime I feel a little low. God bless all ✨❤️

Thankyou for this pice of information.  I was afraid to think that  he was in pain.

It is extraordinarily rare that I cry. I can’t even remember the last time. This made me weep. Wow.

It, kind of half way reminds me of an l.s.d. or mushroom trip, Thanks for journey, now i am more inquisitive to the mind.

<a href="">4:07</a> melodysheepers, thank me later

We truly are a wondrous and extremely complex forms of life, and yet we still don&#39;t&#39; know the half of it as my grandad use to say when i was growing up.

1400 dislikes? think they need to....&quot;take a step to the right&quot;

My favourite TED Talk. Never gets old &lt;3 &lt;3

So how do i go about going into the nirvana  then

I truly believe that this is exactly what Buddha archived at the moment he got enlightened. It let me speechless.

she seems like she&#39;s a witch

If that doesn’t move you... 🤦‍♀️ ...nothing will
