Never liked Frozen, never liked this song. I&#39;m just so surprised it&#39;s been 10 WHOLE YEARS since the song got viral and it was everywhere. Where did the time go?

Perfect dawn, hinde do√±a
Was this even the girl that voiced Elsa in Frozen?? Just random people doing music videos of an Animated movie they didn&#39;t create 

2024 and still listening to my favorite song as a child 

 <b>a u t h e n t i c v i e w s</b>  and Demi Lovato the duo making virals

great song ever !!!

Yup we had a perfect childhood

Mann I would rewatch this all the time I think on my dvd

let one go can t hold it back anymore,better text

 still enjoying 
Demi, you are the best, no one has such a strong side of vocals, in my case looks to goosebumps, such a moment of strong voice.

Who is still listening to this song in 2024?

they should cast demi as elsa in live action frozen

<b>A u t h e n t i c V i e w s D a w  t C a w m</b>  and Demi Lovatoare a match made in heaven, Best song on album this song  
Better than Idina menzel version 

2024 
The song that helped me embrace my sexuality more ~ &lt;3

10 years ago? Damn  am I the only one watching this is 2024?

I listened to this in high school. Before I graduated last year.

I was 6 years old listening to this song that I didn't know was demi, now I'm 16 
&quot;Out here in the cold, thin air, I finally can breathe... I know I left a life behind, but I&#39;m too relieved to grieve...&quot; Demi Lovato&#39;s rendition takes this Disney classic to a whole new level.

I love the message they give in this song, to always be yourself and don&#39;t charge for anyone.

Yes I am

I heard many songs and they come and go these pass 10 years and beyond. But this one song I vow to never let it go. It will always be in my heart forever.

<i>omg</i>

I watch it when i was 14 i watch it 10 times frozen 1now im 20 crazy time flies

What a good memory going to the cinema and watching the frozen movie and I always listened to deminostalgia
I love this, my favorite version of let it go! 

Tini's version is better
The fact that they used this version in the ending credits

Kq, Ô∏èÔ∏è
Still listening in 2024 hands down better than the original version. No one can deny Demi‚Äôs talent.

I like the other movie version

original ver is the best for mei don&#39;t need her arrangement at all

How time flies, I was in grade school when this was released. Now I&#39;m still in grade school

Disney music at its peak:

This song is so good

Someone from 2024?
Who is here in 2024

A beautiful and exciting performance even now in 2024 It's similar to Roni Dlomi's performance at the Gallis 2 show in Sukkot 2014
I‚Äôm crying from so much nostalgia of course Who else is?

‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏•‡∏á Let it goThe snow glows white on the mountain tonightNot a footprint to be seenA kingdom of isolationAnd it looks like I&#39;m the queenThe wind is howling like this swirling storm insideCouldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I triedDon&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them seeBe the good girl you always have to beConceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them knowWell, now they knowLet it go, let it goCan&#39;t hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it goTurn away and slam the doorI don&#39;t care what they&#39;re going to sayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anywayIt&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem smallAnd the fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at allIt&#39;s time to see what I can doTo test the limits and break throughNo right, no wrong, no rules for meI&#39;m freeLet it go, let it goI am one with the wind and skyLet it go, let it goYou&#39;ll never see me cryHere I stand and here I stayLet the storm rage onMy power flurries through the air into the groundMy soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all aroundAnd one thought crystallizes like an icy blastI&#39;m never going back, the past is in the pastLet it go, let it goAnd I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawnLet it go, let it goThat perfect girl is goneHere I stand in the light of dayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway

Fun fact: is that I only found out about the singer in 2024

I love this song
I love this song

2024
Fun fact: had no idea Demi samg this song

Dang, this song gave me nostalgia vibes. Watched this after watching Frozen

Well beyond 10 years since this released back in 2013, gotta thank the cast (namely Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell) and crew behind Frozen for help making this movie possible. But most importantly, Demi Lovato for giving a rousing performance for the pop version of the Oscar-winning hit song Let It Go! I take my hat off to you.

bought my first car 10 years ago, this was the first song I played in it. Needed some money and sold the car last year. Every time I hear this song, brings me back all the good memories with my old car. I miss it so much

Iconic credits song from Frozen 

Listening to it in 2024

Now in 2024

Ok, I'm putting it here because I can't comment on Tini's and the same thing happens to me, I'm the only one who thinks that in both videos it seems that in the movie there is a love triangle between Hans, Kristoff and Elsa and in Tini's couple look like Kristoff and Elsa and I feel old since this video and in general the originals came out 10 YEARS ago
I&#39;m hearing this while it&#39;s snowing outside Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

Here in 2024

Who‚Äôs listening this in 2024

2024 still here for her amazing vocals 

Hello 2024 
Such a great song and Demi&#39;s voice is so good. I just don&#39;t like it when artists change the melody of how the original sounds. People say that it&#39;s nice for artists to inject their own style and personality, but why does that have to include melody tweaking? So while I think Demi does a good job in here, I don&#39;t like the parts where she changes the melody (personal preference). Same as how I did not like Halle Bailey&#39;s version of Part of Your World. While she has a beautiful voice, she absolutely ruined the song for me because of the changes she made to it. A great example of how an artist can still own a cover song completely without messing with the melody is Pink&#39;s cover of Hopelessly Devoted by Olivia Newton John.  She didn&#39;t mess with the melody, she sang it as it is, but still made it her own.

Who else is watching 2024? .,.

Who can listened in 2024

Stop comparing this version with Idina&#39;s to say this is bad, this is a pop version its not supposed to be the same as the original, Im pretty sure Demi could sing the original version and it would sound amazing too.I know Idina&#39;s version is epic and literally gives me chills, this is not supposed to be that

it's been 10 years
i remember watching this music video on loop on my ipod touch, waiting for frozen to come out when i was literally 8. god i feel so old. im so glad i was target audience for frozen when it came out, though. what an era.

This song is 10 years old.

Demi Lovato‚Ä¢Let It Go (From &quot;Frozen / Single Version)

Let It Go (From &quot;Frozen / Single Version)

<a href="">#Equanimity</a> means letting go of the past and starting to correct past karma that binds us correctly.
<a href="">2:51</a>

I can say that she actually cant sing this way on live. Her live performance is different from this video.

Ya

Funs:listening to this music in 2024

There&#39;s someone listing in 2023?

Why I like this one better: ‚Äúup here in the cold thin air, I finally can breathe. I know a left a life behind, but I‚Äôm too relieved to grieve!‚Äù I think this line tells Elsa‚Äôs story so much more than the whole song of let it go and it‚Äôs so relatable. She‚Äôs just so happy to finally be free she doesn‚Äôt see the consequences of her actions yet.

I am

Elsa: This is me!

Unpopular opinion: this is better than Idina Menzel It also would have been cool if they made the live action room turn icy/cold as the song built

HELP THE MOVIE IS 10 YEARS OLD
Almost a decade is crazy. I was in first grade when this came out. The Nostalgia is unbeatable

  We love you from Texas.

Happy 10th Anniversary to Frozen! I was only 5 when it came out. My cousin and I watched the movie at the theater with my parents. We later brought her home after she slept through the movie (LOL). I later went to my grandparent&#39;s old house and celebrated Thanksgiving with her and my dad&#39;s side of the family. I miss those days. Please, I beg of you enjoy your childhoods. November 27, 2013-November 27, 2023.

Let it go, let it go

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn my back, and slam the door

The snow blows white on the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I&#39;m the queen

The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside

Couldn&#39;t keep it in

Heaven knows I tried

Don&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them see

Be the good girl, you always have to be

Conceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them know

Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I&#39;ll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

It&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me, can&#39;t get to me at all

Up here in the cold, thin air I finally can breathe

I know I left a life behind, but I&#39;m too relieved to grieve

Let it go, let it go

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn my back, and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I&#39;ll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

Standing frozen in the life I&#39;ve chosen

You won&#39;t find me, the past is so behind me

Buried in the snow

Let it go, let it go

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I&#39;ll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

Let it go, go, nah-nah

Here I stand

Let it go, let it go

Let it go

The most heartwrecking version of this song. Reminds me of my escape from abusive home. Chills every time I listen to this. Truly grateful that this piece of art exists.  &lt;3

10 years old!I still love Demi and this version of the song so much

It&#39;s almost 10 years, I listened to this song when I was 11 years old, and now I&#39;m 20, when this music video pops out on my homepage, I rewatch this. So nostalgic 

Happy 10th anniversary Frozen. 
Her voice 
10 year ago!! A whole decade! Whose still here for the memories Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

Why I like this one better: ‚Äúup here in the cold thin air, I finally can breathe.

A few years ago i thought this was Megan Trainer 

Nostalgic Ô∏è
Very handsome! Goosebumps

Alway one of Disney princess song

Demi Lovato has an incredible range. She takes this song to a different level.

For me, this song matches Demi's voice perfectly.
PRETTY

I like song
pov: your watching disney channel on commercial breaks in 2013-14

did demi sing it?
Oh my god I remember listening to this song when I was like 5! I didn&#39;t even know it was from Demi Lovato! This brings so much memories 

What language do you speak?
or are you english
are you Spanish
The singing voice, the expressiveness, everything is cool.

The singing voice, the expressiveness, everything is cool.

Listening to let it go again, it feels like a whole new meaning for me

I used to sing demis version all the time

Rafally

I can't believe I know her since I was a child. I used to love the song "Frozen" and put it everywhere, but I didn't expect that my favorite singer was the one who sang it. Tony found out  The best coincidence.
I came here because my daughter keeps singing this song endlessly.Now I have been cursed by this song for the rest of my life.don&#39;t be confused, I love my daughter.That&#39;s why I&#39;m here prolonging the curses of this song and keep debating my existence.By the way, I graduated from cocomelon. for those who are still on that stage, good luck brother. my spirit has always been with you.endure brother and win the war. there will be another war ahead.

I miss her
I love this song since I was a child
What demi honestly I am not airing out just my opinions but ppl must have listened to this song so fucking much but with the anarchist I always have a bold blatant message for ppl who have impacted blessed my life in every real way imaginable and im waiting on cue like I always do babe

I'm addicted to this beautiful voice 
omg!??! one of my fav singer!

Eu vi a Demi Lovato no jornal nacional no The town e ela cantou

This song reminds me of Supergirl from the DCEU

This song will always bring back memories of November 2013-January 2014. I remember when Frozen first came out I was only 5yrs old. I saw the movie in theaters, then when it came out on DVD in January 2014, my cousins first watched the movie then, we immediately fell in love with the Frozen franchise. 2013 was a great year for music especially, November, May, June, July, September, December, January, and March. I miss you 2013, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 was my childhood. This 2020&#39;s decade sucks.

We are making it out of Arandele with this

I sang this version at my communion and that‚Äôs when I was 8 and I‚Äôm 17 now

 I love this song 
When you listen to this song in 2023 it hits different 

I suggest you all to go listen the french version of Anais Delva 

I love her, she has a beautiful voice, apart from that she is also a beauty
I&#39;m listening to this at night 

Oi

2023 sep

Ya this song is fire 

oh they mothered

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation

And it looks like I&#39;m the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

Couldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don&#39;t let them in

Don&#39;t let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, don&#39;t feel

Don&#39;t let them know

Well, now they know

Let it go!

Let it go!

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go!

Let it go!

Turn away and slam the door

I don&#39;t care
What they&#39;re going to say

Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway

It&#39;s funny how some distance

Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me

Can&#39;t get to me at all

It&#39;s time to see what I can do

To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong, no rules for me

I&#39;m free

Let it go!

Let it go!

I am one with the wind and sky

Let it go!

Let it go!

You&#39;ll never see me cry

Here I stand and here I&#39;ll stay

Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I&#39;m never going back, The past is in the past

Let it go!

Let it go!

And I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn

Let it go!

Let it go!

That perfect girl is gone

Here I stand in the light of day

Let the storm rage on!

The cold never bothered me anyway

CONCEAL, DONT FEEL

Frozen Was the last good Movie Of Disney

I loved this song and I so

I was so obsessed with frozen when it came out

Idk why tf I‚Äôm here.

This song is a great litmus test. On the surface it&#39;s a celebration of independence and self-actualization. The people who stop their analysis there probably get swept away by the instrumentals and catchy lines without bothering to think about it.Remember this song came from the snow witch at her worst, running away from everything she had in life, everyone she knew or cared for, to retreat to a mountain alone. &quot;Here I stand and here I&#39;ll stay.&quot; It was a rash decision but she&#39;s doubling down on it. &quot;The cold never bothered me anyway.&quot; She&#39;s caused endless winter, destruction, probably deaths, and she&#39;s only concerned with her own comfort. &quot;The fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at all.&quot; Not fears conquered, not even fears confronted. Fears that she ran away from. You can&#39;t run away from fear, it&#39;s inside you. What happens when someone she cared about showed up and became the voice and face of those fears?No, this song is not inspiring. It&#39;s a song of a little lost girl in desperate need of help even as she runs away from it.

Why i feel the lyrics right now?

I was in 4th grade when this song came out and now I&#39;m currently enrolled in 2nd year college. Time flies so fast after the year 2020.

Both versions are incredibly relatable, but one to someone in a position of trauma and wants to be set free and the other to someone who wants to bury their old self and rebuild like a phoenix.Small changes in the lyrics that changed the meaning of the song.

You love me Demmy Lovato I love you
I one day I decided to watch frozen

THIS WAS CREATED BY DEMI LOVATO?!?

LOVE this version! Demi‚Äôs voice is incredible!

this is also from ralph breaks the internet

Actually it&#39;s Fuck It All Fuck it all

I like it how some songs show parts of the movie they are singing this is beautiful good job Demi 10/10

I always wonder how Disney got her involved in another project like this after what happened to her while she was a Disney star

while i love this, the original is and will always be the best. even almost 10 years later, i still love it.

i was 12 frist time i watch the movie now am 21

This song never gets old! It shows what a lot of girls have to go through in life. They are usually told to be good girls and not show how they really are and what they really want. A lot of women have lived and are living according to society preferences just to be loved! This song sends love, happiness and strength to each and every woman in the world!

I loved this song so much as a kid (this version )

Not me actually listening to this in 2023 lmao

I love you demi lovato idola

I believe nostalgia is coming back to summer 2023 big time so much fun

Can&#39;t believe its been so many years but still i always come back here once in a whileProbably the best animation movie song ever

Enticed young girls to her now they will grow up to abort babies and be just like her. How disgusting

I don&#39;t care if they called me childish or whatever. But frozen is my favorite Disney movie. Nothing can replace it. I learned a lot. It&#39;s my comfort movie. Rooting for another season

<a href="">2:39</a>

<a href="">2:24</a>

the fact that she whrote the song and everything, but the other verison of the song that aperas in the movie, took ALL the credit. such a shame. (exuse my bad english)

It's a great song 
So many years have passed since I last watched the movie yet still an iconic song

I love that this is more of a casual version.For a sec i thought i imagined the edits, glad i didnt lol

Dirty version is better

I remember the first time i heard this song in 2013 when i was 7 and i kept listening to it on repeat that year. Today i heard this song again for the first time after 10 years and it gave me goosebumps how i remember exactly how the song goes 

Im waiting to watch this in 2025 if someone likes my comment 

2022

I love frozen

My gosh, my music taste has evolved in the last decade. But this song still is banger!

Almost a decade , but still hits the same!...I was a high school student then and now a graduate. Things changed, but this song still gives boost and that strong spirit!.

LET IT GO
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation

And it looks like I&#39;m the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

Couldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them know

Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go

Can&#39;t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn away and slam the door

I don&#39;t care what they&#39;re going to say

Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway

It&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at all

It&#39;s time to see what I can do

To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong, no rules for me

I&#39;m free

Let it go, let it go

I am one with the wind and sky

Let it go, let it go

You&#39;ll never see me cry

Here I stand and here I stay

Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I&#39;m never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go

And I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn

Let it go, let it go

That perfect girl is gone

Here I stand in the light of day

Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway

9 years later this music video is still so amazing to this day :]

This is a beautiful song

omg

This song is turning 10 years this year, but it&#39;s still MASTERPIECE.

Can&#39;t believe this is 10 years ago 

honestly, i feel like Demi Lovoto had a hard time because she grew up trying to be britney spears when she was an Adele.

It was a success when it came out and it is good to be free but you should not abuse Freedom  greetings from Chile

One Word : Nostalgia
 you‚Äôve got a  beautiful voice that sounds like an angel   I love you so much demi you truly are my hero 
So wonderful past is past present is present do well something new

Exactly why does this version exist? It doesn&#39;t add anything or improve anything over the original. If anything at all, it just adds a pretty face to the video, it is inferior to the orignal in each and every way. WHY THE FUCK DOES THIS EXIST?

Ur listening in 2024

After Idina Menzel, it was Demi Lovato who sang Let it Go in the 2013 Disney 3D-animated movie Frozen, 2019 Square Enix video game Kingdom Hearts 3, and Elsa was told as saying, the cold never bothered me anyway.<a href="">#DemiLovato</a> <a href="">#IdinaMenzel</a> <a href="">#Elsa</a> <a href="">#Sora</a> <a href="">#DonaldDuck</a> <a href="">#Goofy</a> <a href="">#LetitGo</a> <a href="">#Frozen</a> <a href="">#KingdomHearts3</a> <a href="">#KH3</a> <a href="">#Disney</a> <a href="">#SquareEnix</a>
