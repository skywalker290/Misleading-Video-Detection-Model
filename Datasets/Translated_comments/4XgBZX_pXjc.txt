Who came here after sara ali khan act this scene 

I just saw saras’ acting on this dialogue on Instagram. Not even close

Saif is better actor than sara ali khan

Here after Sara&#39;s recreation 
Who is here after seeing Sara re enact this scene but no one can match Saif in this he is just perfect 

If you have such a friend, there is no fear of an enemy.

The film which revolutionized Hindi cinemaFather of slice of life movies in Hindi cinema

Dear Netflix, we would be entertained enough with these little clips of all such films, Subscription ke paise wapis kro 

What a classic! Every shot with Saif in this movie is hilarious. 

What message netflix wants to spread? Is &quot;Be a man &quot;to control girls as per man&#39;s order? Do they care anything about this?

U bout to have 10 million bruh

Never gets out of my HDD 

The single greatest dialogue was born in this scene.... 

&quot;&quot;OLD IS GOLD&quot;&quot;
Why is Netflix uploading such movie scenes ?

Who else missed THE SLAP here? 

Just 2 hour ago i watched this movie 

This scene is in every way iconic.

This movie is never out of fashion..Goa tourism should thank DCH big time..

I guess Netflix fired that guy who replies to all the comments :(( we miss you whoever you were ;-;

ahhhh i love this movie!

Haan mai…but woh….are suno toh…! Poor guy couldn't complete even a single sentence! !..How sad..
The most significant reason for I prefer Netflix because it replies to most of the comments and unlike other OPT Platforms

Waiting for another episode of behensplaining.

Is this is from 2000s

My fav movies Dil chata hai Zindagi na milengi dobra Bangalore days Neelagasham pacha kadal chivanna bhoomi
We all have a Aakash in our life

See the dressing style, no one can say this is a early 2000 film.

I’m so early that Idk what to comment...well, Dil Chahta Hai never gets old.️

Age Then and now, but still they looks young Amir, akshay and saif 

NEVER GETS OLD

Netflix is life treating you well enough to get a bomb in a pizza box. Koi logic nai koi bhi soch nai lagaya, bas comment ko like kardena bhai
