Dear Netflix, we would be entertained enough with these little clips of all such films, Subscription ke paise wapis kro 😂

What a classic! Every shot with Saif in this movie is hilarious. 😅

What message netflix wants to spread? Is &quot;Be a man &quot;to control girls as per man&#39;s order? Do they care anything about this?

The most significant reason for I prefer Netflix because it replies to most of the comments and unlike other OPT Platforms😊

See the dressing style, no one can say this is a early 2000 film.
