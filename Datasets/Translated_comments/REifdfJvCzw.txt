Is there any tamilians watching this trailer . If yes give likes to me

A 10years old film version based on Chetan Bhagats novel but still has a resemblence in the story style......from the Tamil movie Oru poiyavathu.....as per the story plot marriage was a plot between two families in which convinsing both families was the climax solution part..... but in Oru poiyavathu hero heroines unknowingly dont meet each other in the convinsing part this was revealed in the end.....but that was  long ago that was the film making in that year and according to the target audience in that language and very few movies released in other languages......

Awesome.

Woah!!! Today i subconsciously willed to watch the trailer of 2 states ... Nd suprisingly today is the same date 18 april d movie was released i felt so refreshing after watching d trailer again

Love this movie.

I'm sock. Which year did I watch this movie? Why did this accident happen to me guys? I'm still drunk.
Chennaiki vaasu means only Tamilians Madrasi means Telugu + Tamil.. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Who is after hearing Mast Magan?As a Tamilian i like the story.

This should have been called 2 Much Racism 

Where is the full movie ???

Ananya in the movie is different from the Ananya in the novel.

Alia Bhatt’s acting of Ananya isn’t what you would expect after reading the novel. Arjun was ok but they honestly could’ve had a much much better cast and screenplay.

This is a super filmWho all support this like this comment

If this would be released in 2020

That&#39;s Amrita singh!!

Can you upload the full movie.I want to see

Only going to watch this for Amrita Singh and Revathi

Great movie first Arjun kapoor movie worth watching after 4 years.

Madrasi are people from state of Madras  (Split to 4 states by 1950 and In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu )  4 states are TN , Andra and seemandra  , Kerala and Karnataka - Exclude Mysore Kingdom. Know your Indian History and geography. And in South a Skin tone of family members are well mixed unlike other parts.Female beauty has many other criteria and skin tone stands way below in the list.A women or a girl is not judged by skin tone and its only on there action. Racism is more these days than before reading this comments makes me feel South is better place with cultured people who never rush to insult other person - Acceptance of skin tone is more here as its well mixed in every family.So know your fellow Indian before sharing your stupidity and show casing you illiteracy here.

Can&#39;t wait 

alia bhat looks farther from a Tamilian just like a cat differs from a dog..

Haters hate:-!Waitin 18th april !!!arjun kapoor luks too hot33:-<b>:-</b>(lyk a nerd though)alia luks sweet Read d four tyms!!chetan bhagt u r a mindblowing writer!!!18th april come quickly plszz

Its a movie and see it in that way... it looks promising... and its for entertainment purposes only.. If u have negative comments please dont comment here.  :) kind request.

I read the novel after watching the trailer :)

the trailer is mast hai
No offence..But Alia doesn Luk like a Tamilian....like deepika did In Chennai Express! :/
awaiting for it...

wrong casting . . alia is not looking at all  as a south indian girl . . arjun is still fine . . looks nerdy. . could have been better

Arjun Kapoor please accept that you cant act!Here Alia looks more punjabi than you!

Don&#39;t think it will be that good honestly. And such cheap scenes in the trailer, what will the movie be like.

Arjun is also flopping...
I fell in luv wid dis novel..





this is gonna be a blockbuster because of chetan bhagatstory is amazing

this is gonna be a blockbuster because of chetan bhagatstory is amazing

Arjun is d bst all girls will watch this film for us LUV U Arjun
Ak rocks

Looks amazing!! I&#39;m waiting for the songs!!!!!!

Hope mve wil do th best.

My reaction- Meh...

hmm..hope its good and interesting..plus that one dialogue where Alia says that tragedy is the new cool is only because there have been many film makers killing off lead actors and actresses in the end. Sometimes its kind of a disappointment to see the whole movie about love and then to find out that the leads die anyway. Easy way out is what suicide really is, esp in ram leela, aashique 2 etc. Usually people watch films to relax and see something nice and happy, escape harsh realities. Anyway, hope this film turns out good.

Can&#39;t wait

 <a href="">#ALIYABHATT</a>  AGAIN HER AFter highway !!!!! does she looks whts required !!!! ?? :P ha ha .......

Seems nothing like novel!!! Tamilian my foot she doesn&#39;t even look earthian!

<a href="">0:43</a> se <a href="">0:48</a>matlab movie family ke saath nahi dekhi jaa saktiPata nahi sex-chumma chati kab tak chalega.... ....
Tremendous cinematography!!
i don&#39;t get this why the hell do they make movies to downgrade south indians

Waiting for this movie

I am soo excited for this movie... Arjun kapoor, alia bhatt , the songs..!!! Gosh cant wait to watch it :D

Ok.

Hv read th novel twice and now eagrly waiting fr 18th april.. :)

Alia is the best :) would watch it just for her 

Disappointed!! Arjun Kapoor You Suck Man

Why they take punjab all the time , why they cannot take other some other culture family.Thats why this movie is so common like other movies

not at all impressing ya&#39;ll.. I expected a better trailer!

hahah again same shit movie :P welcome 

i am soo looking forward to this movie. i just hope that it does justice to the book

2 States of chetan bhagat ???

Really very bad trailer same movie through out the year it look same like gori teri pyar mei the worst movie ever and now this based on marriage really veryy bad bollywood is going downward direction in history of movies

yet another piece 0f crap...ruining a beautiful novel by transforming it into junk movie

Waiting excitedly to  see the awesome movie in theaters wrote by the great writer cheatn bhagat. 2 state......

Waiting excitedly to  see the awesome movie in theaters wrote by the great writer cheatn bhagat. 2 state......

i think they should cast chetan bhagat and ananya swaminathan.

Jordaar!!!
Super likeI had read dis novelExcited:-)

Ye to Chetan Bhagat novel hai 2states.....lol

<a href="">

Blatant R.A.C.I.S.M gone unnoticed!!! Good work N&amp;G, Dharma prod and censor board... Sad times theses!!!

Woah!..Novel has been totally transformed into the movie.:*<a href="">#AlreadyExcited</a> !

alia bhaat...&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
what a shit choice of hero ...better if it cud have ranbir kapoor and deepika...god this sick pair will make me loose my hair .....huh

Dolly ahluwalia would hv been better choice as Alia&#39;s mother instead of amrita singh...she impressed me a lot in vicky donar as punjabi sardarni

alia bhatt looks complete misfit for this role...she cant act...deepika padukone woul hv been better choice...i liked Arjun&#39;s performance in Ishaqzaade,but here his acting is not looking impressive....although Ronit roy&#39;s choice as Arjun&#39;s father is gud..he is a brilliant actor....

Two different families Very enjoying

Deepika or priyanka wud ve done justice to the tamilian role

Reminded Me of The time when I read 2 States,,,  <a href="">#awesomechemistry</a>  Gonna Watch It

Awesome trailer..!! I had loved the book... eagerly waiting for the film.....!! Superbb..!!

maaf karna 90% tamilian gore nahi hote lmfaoo
as like as writen in book...

There are so many &#39;Aww&#39; moments in this movie! &lt;3

interesting movie oops trailer :P ... whole story plot covered in trailer...!! HIT Like If You agree..!!

Luv alia n arjunGonna be a hit music is too good

I just hope it would be good movie for both Alia and arjun

Bakwas!

shiiiitttt wtf is  that

Any dialogue by Alia has been heard aadha audi hai….
90% tml you are not even fair
The life story of the new Indian couple. Sounds like funnn ! :D

Alia bhatt is showing or reflecting her family values by doing intimate scenes

If only they casted a real South Indian looking Tamil Brahmin in place of Alia, who is a Kashmiri Pandit and looks 99% different than any other Tamil I&#39;ve ever seen. Oh the irony! Bollywood at what it does best.  

after watching this trailer i felt that i wasted my precious 2.50 minute 

super trailer............
Nice

God I loved the book and am already in love with the movie !!!! Arjun Kapoor !!!!!!! :* :* :*Come fast !!! :/

WATCCH JATT JAMES BOND TRAILER ...ZARINE KHAN AND GIPPY GREWAL ....

I&#39;m so excited for this movie! Their chemistry is do different and welcomed and from the looks of it, this shall be a great movie!

Good

this movie is going to  be a sure hit &lt;3 i mean the story is sooo nice :)it looks soo romantic and very very interesting  <a href="">#falleninlovewitharjun</a>  loved the trailer,,waiting for the movie and the songs ,,looking forward :D :)

The only plus side of dis trailer is the soundtrack..!! 

Waiting for this movie. :D<a href="">#excited</a>! :D

simply wasting our money on another stupid stuff of great Indian cinema ... ;)

another cheap movie to downgrade south indians....!!

This is shot at IIM-AHMEDABAD...i have been there....awesome place.

I just want to watch Amrita singh she was very talented actress good luck to this new stars hope there chemistry on screen will work--this is not first time some one made in this subject movie it seems light comedy 

I HAVE READ THE BOOK AND IT WAS AMAZING...LETS C HOW THE MOVIE COMES OUT TO BE

i think shahid or ranbir wold be the better choice for dis role.. but &quot;2 states&quot; is the only novel which i started and completed too... so i m looking frwrd to watch dis movie.. P.S  <a href="">#aliabhatt</a>   LOOKS FAB in trailers... 

waiting for it................

Wow too good

Gosh such a boring trailer. The cast (Alia, Arjun and Karan Johar) totally ruined such a beautiful story script :-(

Seems like another version of vickey donor

Mix states chemestry very much clashing

nice trailer.... 

Suprab

hope movie is not like the trailer and as awesome as the book

wow!!!

looking interesting enought to watch in theater.. high light alia bhaat wowww!!!! she is awesome... the next big thing in actress n arjun kapoor will be very good as we see dis character is far from what he did in isshaqzade n gunday

wasted fuckin 2mins 50seconds of life, i demand compensation. 

will b an average 

thick
not upto the mark

Looks interesting. 

watching this trailer was a waste of time... found it boring :/

alia baby looking hot yaar
Another great story/script ruined by very bad casting.

good one to carry out

Floped
