❗️ATTENTION❗️On Felix’s next video, let’s all just watch the LAST 30 SECONDS of the video for the first 24 HOURS of it being uploaded. Then after that, we can watch the entire video. Might be fun to see Felix freak out thinking he’s been gone for too long. We’ll be good 9 yr old children if we give him a good welcome like this, <i>Le epic prank!</i>

Buy 1 Get 1...., thats why i bought one to get one

Poor Sven he’s probably wondering where you are

Fron viet nam with love &lt;3

I swear that begining map was one of the starwars Lego map

Sad to say but I believe there is copyrighted music being used possibly without permission in this fan game. They are using pieces from TeamFourStar&#39;s &#39;We are number one (But it&#39;s perfect)&#39;, and I can&#39;t find credit to them.

Pewds didnt recognize the Yes Yes Yes Yes jojo referance, you disappointed me Felix

Brazil good
I like when he  says swedish words lolPewdipie im  sorry i f i dont have watched  your videos for  a While.I have done  other things  likeliving my  life  XD

G fuel is banned in norway

Enki should take all the comments of the video and add them to the game

Meh Dunkey did it better

don&#39;t drink gfuel. It has lead in it.

How about pewduckpie?

Why did I get a notification for this today? 🤔

I have lime disease and I dont kare

He didn’t say anything about the BARRELS!

Eh, Dunkey did it first.

I LOVE YOU PEWDIEPIE

Is math related to science

Bruh, I was playing red dead while was watching this.

Pewds: why is it the LEGO Star Wars bar?Me: <b>quietly gets triggered</b>

You neeed to play LEGO starwars TCS, but this time PLAY BETTER

Anyone else think about how when he reads his lines he&#39;s pretty much voice acting himself

Lego coins? You mean studs?
Um you quit...? But back to push merch?

He said something about the lego menu but not the fact that it had the cantina music

literal videogamedunkey referencebut pewds not shouting him out anyways* sad donkey noises *

Big pp

Felix: “It’s like I’m controlling butter that’s melting from nothing to everything”9 year olds: He’s speaking the language of the gods

It’s t series

I was 18 when I started watching PewdiepieNow I&#39;m 9

Right, so no ones gonna talk about the fact that pewd’s video was copyrighted for like 2 days

<a href="">16:14</a> the legendary quotes we needed.

I really doubt Felix will see this but my game crashes whenever I open Pixelings, I looked it up and the same happens to some other people I just wanna get it fixed so I can play it looks really fun...

mm yes pewdiepie flavor lead

Man pewdiepie those graphics look great but take a look at knack 5

This game looks so fucking good

Why are the graphics actually really good

Yoi

<a href="">14:47</a>Me: confused by the reflection

When fans make better games than pewdiepie.

I like

they messed up- felix has legs?

Felix please stop calling Iran Airen

I feel bad he had to play that

You know it&#39;s a good game when it starts off with a jojo reference

This is innacurate, why does pewds had legs, he should be levitating:&quot;((

Incidentally“Bogo” means stupid in Cebuano xD

who wants to see a speedrun of this?

When this game is just lego star wars 2020

Shut up

Felix: Japan I just want to be in youJapan: <b>&quot;Shock&quot;</b> Its not like i want you to b-BAKA!

&quot;Enki&quot;? Enki sounds like Kylo Ren xD
Best video

Pewds: THEY FLY NOW! Me, who just watched Episode IX: I understood that reference

So many ads

First level looks like Safari BiathlonAnd pod racing

<a href="">2:40</a> The reference of Rey, Fin, and the other people saying They Fly Now! IN Star wars rise of the skywalker

It&#39;s super weird hearing yourself, especially an audio of your voice

<a href="">3:44</a> Media: Pewdiepie says N word again
When Pewds says it’s 69% off and your phone just charged to 69%....

“It’s kind of weird hearing yourself”



Talking in a nutshell

Pewdiepie: “Japan i just want to be in you”



Media: Pewdiepie wants to frick Japan!

This game is weirdly well made, and it’s kinda inspiring.

Felix: &quot;im too tall for it&quot;&quot;Impossible&quot;

Felix: Not sure Marzia is even real.




Mr Robot intensifies

uhhh i think thats t series :/

PewDiePie: It looks like I got Lyme disease.Justin Bieber: <b>Leaves chat</b>

&quot;why does it have a lego star wars menu&quot;

When the weird pewdie monster stands still it looks like he is constipated, sub to me if you agree

$80 to $55 for 2 tubs jesusssssss that’s so much

&quot;It&#39;s over Felix, I have the high ground&quot;

How is this man knows that pewds has a legs?

For some reason, the character looks more like CaptainSparklez

Videogamedunkey&#39;s cameo is fucken great
Bruh, the entire game is an asset flip.

it was 100.000.000 subsribers

<b>There must be a glitch in this game because his avatar has legs.</b>

@<a href="">5:04</a> I don&#39;t think sticking your name on 4 different mobile games that all suck can be good for your reputation even if it fills your wallet xD

Felix: lego coins
Inspired

For the record, Dunkey played this game before Felix lmao 😂.

I remember when Sean played a game with the same models

The game where the girl used neon powers to try to save her brother

WHEN IS LEGO STAR WARS PLAY THROUGH????

now this is pod racing!!!!!!!

you playing this first game makes me lag... pls stop

I love the pick stuff. It&#39;s from that playstation game he played a really long time ago

The game when its a race looks like tatooine

U look like tired

Whats the music called at <a href="">4:14</a>

Get urself a partner that looks at u, just like pewds is looking hat his figurine in <a href="">7:01</a>.

I really hope &quot;I am Pewdiepie and I have Lime&quot; becomes a meme.

It would take over 6 days for t series to get to 100 mil from the start

Game of the Centruy? Nawww....Game of the Millennium

I played this couple months ago. 10/10

Bought my first shaker and 2 tubs of Pewdiepie flavor with this BOGO!

0/10 accuracy.Too many legs.

<a href="">6:34</a> huh what? As in?

Felix: <b>Coughs</b>Youtube captions: [Laughter]

I’ve been watching you since I was 8 years old..... I’m turning 20 this month

thx for the cheap refuel on gfuel lol I wait for the bogo sales

Love it how you need to make the audio wierd to avoid copyright even though the games title has your name in it

Lego Star Wars lol

<a href="">16:15</a> og&#39;s remember
this game is so unrealistic pewdiepie has legs like thats the  most unrealistic thing ever

Potato salad
Somebody does this to a big company and they sue their asses. Pewdiepie does the opposite

He has the power of God and anime on his side

Where can I find this game?

This game is inaccurate, pewdiepie doesn’t have legs

The developer of the game now can use this video to improve the game with real pewdiepie reading dialogues

the jojoke  though

<a href="">00:52</a>, if Felix double wields the weapon, does he have big PP energy?

I mean this is a really well done game. It&#39;s basically was made to appeal a single person (Felix).

<a href="">2:26</a>Pewdiepie: Now this is fricking podracing!

ppdie
This video is fake and those &quot;legs&quot; are paid actors.

In all seriousness, considering how much work goes into making a game, this really isn&#39;t half bad.

This game looks so good and pewdiepie just takes it for granted. Too big for his britches.

Mx

&quot;How to take a break for dummies&quot; i mean you could just detox from social media/youtube and limit yourself to certain useful apps then do whatever else you wannna do as a hobby. take a walk get a massage, read a book, watch movies/shows, even watch YouTube just don&#39;t make anything. whatever it is u feel like doing. From a week to a month should be enough for you to feel mentally refreshed and come back with a ton of video ideas that you might have had while on break.

ok&#39;

Is this a meme game...?
