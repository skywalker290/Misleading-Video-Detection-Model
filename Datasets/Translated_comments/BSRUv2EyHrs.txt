Kashi ko ae bajirao deserve nhi karta 😡 harami sala
Priyanka is fabulous

Kashi ls the best❤

Kashi ls the best❤

The truth is, how much pain a wife must have to endure at that time when she became a teenage wife. This happened without any fault of her life with this wonderful lady. It was absolutely true that the man could not have said that the sigh of his heart would have ended everything.
you help me please

What Bajirao Mastani movie taught me that you can give all your love and devotion to one beloved person like kashibai did to Bajirao and they can replace your reject you for another person like Bajirao went for Mastani then staying loyal to kashibaiLove is an illusion and fantasy we set on strangers and love is the Sweetest poison

This movie don&#39;t lots of history but, she telling full of love chemistry.

I need the subtitles in Spanish 😭😭😭
I became a fan of Priyanka ma'am after watching this movie...❤❤ Her expression was very painful......💘💘💔
You took my life with me and I gave you my happiness but you took me with my heart.....😭 Hearttouching point❤❤😞😞
What has Priyanka told about Kashi Bai's feeling?
Kashi bai Priyanka Chopra wow what role have you played?
Evergreen movie
Happy Birthday mastani ji❤️❤️❤️
I wish men would think that because of us someone else will suffer.
In this world, no matter how much you want someone, you will always betray him.
I&#39;m the kashi in my story

Priyanka&#39;s every dialogue has a deep emotion❤

This movie  is  Totally  against the Muslims,,,,

Priyanka stole the show in this movie

Jodha ny b to akbar sy shadi ki th tou wo sahi kisi hoi
watching your loved one love someone else hurts so much, I don&#39;t know how kashi bai tolerated it.

Priyanka is all time Gorgeous ❤

Someone sacrificing their entire life for their loved one and what they got in return......Infidelity in that marriage.I just feel by no means peshwamastani&#39;s love story should have been this glorified

Even in movie discrimination really

Kashi has some self respect atleast

Bajirao has betrayed Bajirao.
At <a href="">1:53</a>, what is he saying? Mastani sahiba, aapki surkasha? This dialogue is not properly audible. Can anyone please help?

Raju Neeraj made for each other

PC is best

I love kashi &#39;s role in whole movie

There is one mastani in every indian woman&#39;s life... Somewhere in the fantasy of her husband 😛

Whuhhh
Priyanka's expressions are unmatched. His acting in this film has given him the best rating.
Priyanka Chopra acting is amazing 🤩❤
All scenes are masterpiece❤

I only see a wife&#39;s pain and her love for her husband

Priyanka rocked. The pain the torture 😢 in her eyes is visible. I guess every wife would be on priyankaz side ❤

What kind of love are these two?
Priyanka is the real hero of the movie

😅😅😅

How bajirao was hero,By hurting  wife and showing that he and mastani were the icon of love, I never saw love of mastani and bajirao infront of Kashi bhai&#39;s pain🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

How was the response to this movie? Was it a hit?

Kashi was a strong character person.

Mastani, you loved Baji before meeting him but for how many days, why did you love Baji after meeting him but how many years did you love and how many years of love did Baji say?
When Mastani loved, what he did wrong with Kashi or how the couple did it with Akabar, how Padmavati did what was right, what is the secret, whether he is Muslim or Hindu, whether he is Muslim or Hindu.
Priyanka has done amazing acting.
super film

Hindu-Muslim union again Mastali's mother is also Hindu but they respected each other's opinions and kept their love alive no matter how many problems they faced, they expressed their emotional unity.
I liked tge dialogue,  when Kashi days,  &quot;aapki patni na hoke aapki priyasi hote toh aachs hota&quot;

<a href="">15:35</a> How pain was depicted even after all the words: She&#39;ll try to blow diyas but coz of pain in her throat it was difficult to proceed. Excellent to the par, I dono about rajmouli movie historical emotion depiction, this scene of Kashibai and Bajirao took movie on different level n SLB sir, my heads down for your work. Priyanka you deserve the world and nothing less, keep conquering Queen

It was fucked up what bajirao did to those 2 women he had no right to ruin both of thier lives. Both bajirao and mastaani desperately trying to prove an extra marital affair as ishq was horribly wrong. It&#39;s not love if u fall in love with someone else. U cant love 2 people at once that&#39;s not love.

Today, the size of your bundle of hands has made this beautiful daughter as beautiful as Sindhoor. Chills!!!
Priyanka acted very nicely here.

i am not gonna hesitate to tell this but peshwa is a MAN SLUT.

Ful movi lood kijye
Priyanka is best wife❤❤❤
Deepika is excellent actor and beauty of this movie.  She has a deep core live for  him, but poorly every one is tied to their beliefs.  It is  wrong to insult of Allah  and for a love of human  for human.

❤❤ Raja Rajwadon Kab Aati Hai Na very beautiful song Bhojpuri Aisi aaj kaun hai kaun hai no one old name never breaks to the public
God has given big punishment to both bajirao and mastani for illegal relationship...🤔🤔pain of kashi bhai fired love of Mastani...

What movie will you make this year Bajirao ❤
All Dialogues 👌
In this Part of Picture Dipika’s Roll is great

Kashi Bai has said the right thing, I had read in history that Bajirao Peshwa was famous because of his love affair with a woman named Mastani.
This ranveer is a very bad actor,  can&#39;t see him as Bajirao Peshwa . Misfits the role .

Maturity Realisation is that the kashi is real warrior

Everyone saw the pain of the sister but no one saw that how much humiliation Deepika had to endure just for the sake of Ranveer's daughter but she made a big mistake because she also loved Ranveer and she also caused that much pain so why should only the sister be seen, look at Deepika also. 😊😊😊
Priyanka&#39;s one line - aapne to humse humara guroor chheen liya.. The way she is delivered is commendable.

Mastani is nothing but a homewrecker

Chhhi .Bajirao n mastani bekar log
My favorite and most loving❤❤ character KASHIBAI 😘😘😘Priyanka 🤩🤩is the best for kashi🥰🥰 role😊
Each and every comment below I read about Kashibai.......This movie is about the love of Bhajirao and masthani but........ Kashibai stole the show........

Very  nice

I love Mastani ❤
Behuda movie

Deepika only had 1 facial expression in the entire movie

all I can see is how a huge Priyanka character is getting appreciated although her screentime is much less than Ranveer and Deepike viz-a-vi Bajirao and Mastaani

This scene shows how mean bajirao is!

I love Priyanka mam acting as kashibai💓💓💓💓
I can feel each and every word of Kashi is how much hurtful instead of Mastani.. 😢

I saw only Ksshi&#39;s pain n heart touching words .

Too bad there are no english subs

Kashibai was actually a very good person… after bajirao and mastani’s death she raised shamsher bahadur as her own son and gave all the rights in the court…

Got it 💯
The grate Bajirao peshva 🚩🙏🚩🙏🚩🙏
The name of the movie should be kashi. The world knows and appreciates bajirao and mastani&#39;s sacrifice. But  kashi&#39;s pain is untold,unsung, hidden and lost inside the walls of shanivar wada.deep respect kashibai

What to do with strangers😔😔😔
After watching this scene  now  I have become a fan of priyanka... Her acting is really showing kashi&#39;s pain... Outstanding acting

Priyanka chopra&#39;s one line &quot; apne toh hamse hamara gurur hi chin liya&quot;  overpowered every scene in that movie. 🎤 drop

The scene where she discovers infidelity..... is like time frozen in time.

Point noted about the colours

Wow brilliant role-played by Priyanka. ❤

This movie is all about extra marital affair.

Why Can&#39;t anyone see the pain behind Deepika&#39;s character........

Ranbir acted very nice and well mature.

Even though this film shows the love of Bajirao and Mastani, it did not win anyone's heart because of his sorrow, but I did not show anyone's sorrow.
The pain in priyanka&#39;s eyes when she said &quot; Radhe Krishna radhe krishna ....&quot; was just so real 😢This just portrays how much kashi bhai had suffered coz of rao and how she deserved way better !Priyanka totally nailed it !❤She literally felt the depth of the characterHats off to PC !! ✨🔥

Kashi is the character who is epitome of self respect....level of maturity......patience.... responsible and dutiful.....sach much kashi ka dard koi nhi smjh paya....she is just awsome🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Priyanka rocked ❤️

Why did you find out why Peshwa had any issue? Neither of Peshwa's two wives had an issue with each other and then the whole world was shown this.
This is a story of Bajirao cheated on Kashi Bai to Mastani, not an epic love story of Bajirao and Mastani. Story of Extramarital affair where people glorifying it.

Kashi Bai 💔💔
The poor house was ruined
Asif apne insult karwata!! 😂😂

They madly loved each other but society taboos killed them😢

Deepikas acting ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shri Krishna ji he married 16000 wives that means they&#39;re all his keep

Padmavati was also the 2nd wife. Nobody asked about the first wife, how betrayed she felt, how much pain she endured. Now why showing sympathy to bajirao&#39;s first wife?? Just because the role is played by Priyanka, a well-known actress?? People sometimes can be such hypocrites.....

Kashi or Mastani's Drd Chubhta H lkn. Peshwa got angry
He doesn&#39;t even have 0.1 percentage guilt in his eyes....

What a wonderful actress Priyanka is... 😭 ...Deepika or Ranbir are also seen in front of her...
Anti-bigamy law came into existence in 1951...... This was the 18th century......... wherein kings and Peshwas married more than once. It was not illegal.Moreover, Mastani&#39;s mother was a Muslim...Her dad was from Rajput family. Daughter of King Chhatrasaal......Sanjay Leela Bhansali has misled the audience in all his movies - starting from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (mockery of Gujarati culture), Devdas (misrepresented the entire novel), and now another piece of crap..... I belong to Pune........and am well-versed with the history of Marathas...... Sanjay Leela Bhansali doesn&#39;t know how to portray facts........ and the audience is the fool of the first order......... They watch such movies to have a look at their favourite heroes - heroines.......... Entertainment is the only motive......... even if it means tampering with facts.....

Deepika’s eye expressions 😍

Don't forget the happiness, what happened in the back of your mind... you will never find happiness.
There is no one to trust in, my mother.
Deepika was only served as an eye candy for this film. The real acting masterclass was done by priyanka.

Full movie 😒

Team Mastani ❤
The more director portray  their love story more look  like extra married affair  and cheating....

This is one more masterpiece from Bollywood.

Priyanka stealed the show. Excellent acting she showed her pain in eyes

<a href="">2:45</a> her expressions omg what an actor

Deepika ❤❤❤
Chepu tegela kanipistundi ee picture tesinoni...
Priyanka  stole the complete show. We Accept  or not but its fact.💯💥👌

Don't go to the other side of your society, brother.
I don&#39;t understand Hindi unfortunately.. but I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of Kashi (Priyanka).. simply beautiful with her expressions..just wow..

Deepika ❤❤❤
<a href="">13:45</a> such a beautiful scene and truth of Indian mythology showcased in this movie, nobody remembers Rukmini nobody ever understood the feelings of her ,it&#39;s always Radha at least it&#39;s shown in this movie.

Beautiful creativity , ye to pechle time se bi jyda khubsurat hain

Maturity Is When You Realized That This Film Is About Extra Marital Affair Not A Love Story 💔

<a href="">5:22</a>, this line is dedicated to the haters and boycott gang who are boycotting Pathaan and Besharam Rang.

<a href="">5:22</a>, this is what my answer is to Minister of MP Narottam Mishra on Besharam Rang controversy 😇

Priyanka aa kashibai..or kashibai&#39;s character shows how a women with dignity sense of responsibility and real strength looks like

Khandaani Bahu is beautiful and she is also very social.
Oh just how perfect this movie would’ve been if Nick Jonas was there too! Deepveer and Prick!!

Peiyanka acting is awesome

From this film we know what happens to the wife when the husband starts loving someone else.
A very sad love story that shows when a man, his heart is not enough to conquer from his one woman...Its devastating....

How can this woman speak to Shreemant Chimaji Appasaheb in this manner? He was the slayer of Portuguese regime along with Shrimant Gangaji Naik. She has no manners, only arrogance.

I could feel the mother&#39;s fury from here. She didn&#39;t have to say a single word. She created Bajirao and how dare Mastani rule his heart.

Priyanka Chopra,Kashibai,What a beautiful natural real life heart piercing acting,great!!

Priyanka acting amazing
Priyanka was just amazing.  The pain in her eyes 👀 💔

Her dialogue delivery ..... My ears are bleeding..

Priyanka is phenomenal Deepika is great and ranveer amazing in this movie just amazing

Ghrina ati is mastani and bajirao par😡😡😡😡.. Aslil ki bhi hai bhi hota hai… Kattar got married to her husband 😡😡😡…
Yeah i got kashibai,&#39;s pain but at the same mastani lived in that big place all by herself which was sad too

Priyanka is too gud

Priyanka is best actor for Kashi bai character

As a female, Peshwa and Mastanis lovestory didn&#39;t impress me at all. I felt the heartbreak of kashi more intensely and it disgusted me how he treated her when he very clearly loved kashi first. She was his wife 💔

Priyanka is the main lead and Ranveer and Deepika are in supporting role here 😂😂😂

Peshwa ruined lives of all three

Kashibai great

The race of Muslims is weak in front of Hindus, so how will they mix?
Priyanka is just killing it 🔥

English subtitles please... thanks 🙏

superb priyanka
<a href="">13:07</a> too much painful 😥😥😥Bhot sehenshil the pehle zamane ki auraten jisse prem karte the paati mante the wo kitne saree vivah kar lete the

as being the biggest fan of priyanka this comment section make me full of proud love u pc.....

I don&#39;t know why people only see mastani love story but didn&#39;t see khashi pain. Kashi bai character Changes concept of this worst story

The way she said Rao ......✨

omg how much have you said in your life 😥
😒One thing has to be packed 😒The woman is born with a lot of intelligence and no one knows anyone else....The knowledge of the woman is as per the Bajirao Mastani film. What type of mind do you have, how can you give it to girls or women 😏 stupid males
Deepika well appreciated because of her acting people just supporting priyanka because she was first and hindu wife

Priyanka&#39;s charecter more  more strong than deepika

Can I know  the name of this film

Priyanka best this movie

App kaa naam kyaheh khone neh thum m.m.mmm

One of my all time favourite movie 🎬

Best acting Priyanka ..........
When I was may be of 14 I saw this movie and realises the pain of mastani and bajirao But now I am 18 and I can feel the pain of kashi

Priyanka is amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way PC&#39;s eyes delivered emotions glorified the whole movie!

But that time it was very common to marry multiple women in order to be friend with neighbouring countries

this scene n Priyanka Chopra 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥her acting expression tooo good ....never get tired
In real life, if you are a Mastani, then you will never marry or go between two people.
I’ve seen everybody praising pc but what abt deepika!She has done absolutely brilliant work in this movie ❤️❤️Love from Switzerland. Haha yeso majak 😂

Fucking extra marital affair

Movei ko itna acha batya he or siriyal ko to bas apne man se banae jaa rahe he

Destroying someone else's house and building your own house is not a good thing.
Priyanka
A lot has happened to Kashi🥺
Deepika Padukone's sharara dress lehenga got cloudy as it came out.
My favorite movie ❤❤❤
They made the film to depict the love between Bajirao and Mastaani!! But Priyanka with her marvelous acting of the character Kashi Bai stole the lime light!! And every one understood the pain of KaashiPriyanka is a great actor!!😃

Baajirao and Mastaani had a superficial love, only Kashi&#39;s love as true

This is what you can say when director uses all skills of actors like Deepika, Priyanka and Ranveer these were just killing their characters...

What bajirao done to kashi the same thing she has done with him means that time he would have understand what&#39;s love and what is affairs

Karachiwood tried to glorify a concubine, instead their plan backfired.

This is not the love story of Bajirao Mastani, it is the story of Kashi's pain.
Priyanka 👌👌🌸
why i cnt find full of this movie?

How can a women not feel the pain of another women... Kashi character excellent.... mastani will always be the second women who broke someone&#39;s family....

There could have been other Mastani&#39;s but only one Kashi ! There&#39;s no one like Priyanka Chopra

Kashi Bai u r great ❤️
<a href="">5:25</a> - Black is clearer than any other color.
Priyanka is looking very beautiful in maharashtrian get up.👌🏻
I really love kashi 🥰🔥

Hail Mahadev, Hail Mother Goddess, Hail Guru Gorakshyanath, Hail Baba Gurudev, Hail Lord Shiva, Hail Lord Shiva, Hail Lord Hanuman, Hail Lord Hanuman.
Priyanka is the queen of this movie...but I request SLB to not cast deepika for this type of epic movies as her acting is below average..her dialogue delivery in every movie of hers seems same....reactionless

Kashi Bai ki life bhi kitni tough thi pehle husband left her then raising her kids, mastani jaisi ko jhelna and after the death of Peshwa and mastani unke kid shamsher bahadur ko bhi paala

Mastani should able understand kasi pain if she rallying love

If the person who loves you the most loves you the most, if he becomes a cloud or someone else goes out of you, it is so painful that he cannot stop loving you 🥺🥺
What kind of a way is this🥺
What would Kashi go through on the left heart when she would see her own husband being someone else&#39;s every day, till she would have died watching her love get separated ,I believe that Bajirao Mastani&#39;s love was true, but the pain and suffering she felt after seeing her love separated, she sacrificed her feelings. It was a sign of real love.🥀💔

It is a morality play as much as a love story. Bajiro indulged himself; as many great men do; and he destroyed himself and his family.

Kasibhai - &#39; Rao needs you and his need is my priority &#39;. Such a painful word 😔

One big mistake of Peshwa...Mastani

In A Movie Names Bajirao Mastani, Its Kashibai Who Stole The Show! Enough Proof To Know How Great Job Priyanka Did🙌🏻

What happened to Kashi?
Priyanka is better than Deepika in her role &amp; act

Both Mastani and Kashi played their roles very gracefully when I see tears in their eyes my eyes get filled with tears

Priyanka had such less screen time as kashi but i couldn&#39;t get myself to look over her pain even today after years have passed that the movie released

As much as they wanted to justify &amp; glorify  the love between Bajirao and Mastani, Kashi&#39;s blazing divinity made it more heinous &amp; disgusting. Neither Mastani nor Bajirao could save their dignity &amp; morality. Wonderful job giving Kashi the touch of the Goddess when she sits on the tiger while the scene played out.

These Muslims have ruined this country. By showing them a positive role, their sins will not be reduced.
When Kashi said the part of rukmani and kirshna and I guess somehow tried to show bajirao as kirshna and herself as rukmani it was really intense cuz , in the name of the movie it actually happened because mastani&#39;s name was placed after bajirao not kashi&#39;s name ..... ... But somehow I think it was great that kashi&#39;s name wasn&#39;t placed after bajirao&#39;s because the name of such great and pure woman shouldn&#39;t be placed after a cheater .... Who doesn&#39;t even know how much pain he caused to his wife ... even if it was just a fictional movie but still Kashi deserves sooooo much better

Guys plzz watch her epic role in the sky is pink..... Also Farhan and her chemistry rocks.... We must show love to such movies and this beautiful talented girl PC is really an epic star❤️ proud of this girl.... And plzz guys watch that movie too her acting is raising the standards of actresses in Bollywood ❤️

I only know that if u are in love with someone you cannot love 3rd person its not possible if its pure love.

Kashi should have not divorced Baji and would have married another man, and would have said Rao u are my strength and he is my inspiration..u are the first husband aka their house&#39;s elder husband and he is the younger ... Love u both the same...toodles ....that would have been lovely, isn&#39;t it 😍🙏

Mastani who stole another one&#39;s husband and bajrao who cheats wife is very very bad the true love can be seen in kashibai even after the betrayal she love her husband

Cant see the love of bajirao mastani when kashi is burning inside..

If bajirao had loved kaashi he would had never fell in love wit mastani.. Dat means he dint know meaning of love

Bajirao betrayed her wife for another woman

I know main character are Ranveer and Deepika , but Priyanka Chopra made this film more wonderful, she looks stunning 💝

Priyanka&#39;s acting really overshadowed Deepika in bajirao mastani...after Barfi and Mary Kom, I watch this movie again and again only because of her.

S u r right
Infidelity being romantised to the max......idc if it was child marriage or true love it is what it is ....

Thought movie name is bajiro msatani But in this movie Main character is kashi in my eyes because in whole movie mastani just saying poetry and bajiro fight for mastani rights but the pain kashi sho was just i can&#39;t say it because she welcome mastani and then invite for the dance because her husband love mastani she hide her pain for her husband but her husband what he&#39;s doing bring his lover with pride at home

This movie is a gem 💎

Bajirao was a cheater husband

It makes me happy that Kashi&#39;s character gets more praise nd recognition than mastani 🥺❤️

I don&#39;t like this mastani character at all

The common thing in every popular scenes is the pain of Kashi..  Now you decide who is the show stealer of the movie

These dancers have destroyed the entire empire, what is masti, what is Anarkali?
There is no religion of color 👍👍
Jinnki dhuniyaan bohath badi barbadhiyan mujay vutarvaadhiyaa
This was a very interesting story... complexity level off the chart!!!! As for why polygamy? Because 😩🤣🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️.  Mastani was from a culture where it was customary. Kashi and Bajirao were from a different culture where monogamy was the norm. Bajirao in the movie and book fell in love and so did Mastani. Now he gave her his dagger, not before he burnt her wound to remove poison and coterrize it. A wound he inflicted. To her this was enough a declaration and proposal being a warrior princess. He didn&#39;t know of that custom however. So she went after him to claim him. Kashi... oh Kashibai... betrothed to Rao as a child... grew up devoting her whole life to him. He devoted his life to his sword, and Kashi was his best friend and confidant. The only woman he knew.... until he met another who was a warrior like him and a princess. Aye.... the rest well... we know how that went.

Loved the complexity of the story... Kashi, Rao and Mastani... One could try and slice the pie both ways but it wasn&#39;t so. 3 ways and that is all there is to it... A love that hurt all 3 parties involved...

He was happy with Kashi. He respected her adored her, basically loved her. Then how the hell can a third person enter into his life! I just don&#39;t get this polygamy thing. And also if Kashi bai was doing so I don&#39;t think history would remember her this way and today we weren&#39;t watching a movie glorifying her  affair .

Women women is understood but history is not about women always

Hahaha

That is why history always says Bajirao Mastani and not Bajirao kashi.

Priyanka portrayed kashibais  emotions and her pain in very beautiful way .

Happy Friendship Day friends

I don&#39;t know why but I just focused on kashi💗

Kashif😫😍
KASHIBAI SANSKARI GHAR SE SANSKARI AURAT THI...MASTANI BADCHALAN THI..KHUD ISILIE DUSRO KI MARD KE SAATH CHARITRA DIKHANE KELIYE APNI BADCHALAN MAA SE PERMISSION LE KE AAGAYI...YE BHARATIYA SANSKRITI NAHI HAI..

Perfect carecter
Masthani&#39;s father was a Rajput, but why masthani always follows muslim traditions.

The real victory of movie s due to kashibai ....whole comment section regarding this movie where ever we see is just in the appreciation of priyanka...

The pain of kashi is so intolerable!!!!

This is not the reason why clouds come again and again.
Who are fan of Rudra and Nitanchi

Dipika ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What is up with Deepika&#39;s eyes?

A woman always breaks into another woman's house.. in the form of a mother, in the form of a mother-in-law, in the form of a sister-in-law...man is not the enemy of woman.
i don&#39;t know if anyone noticed but I think his downfall started after his affair with the other woman...once Kashi left his company he didn&#39;t survive at all

Bajrao &amp; Mastani so beautiful match made in heaven

Priyanka Chopra looks beautiful and Gorgeous. Deepika too loooks pretty

Priyanka Chopra never failed to prove that she is the highlight of the show 💥🔥❤️

<a href="">3:25</a> omg 🔥😳💯<a href="">10:06</a> her eyes 🔥😳 <a href="">12:04</a> what a frame 🔥❤️<a href="">13:40</a> 😭Can see deepika and Ranveer act in this movie but Priyanka I can see Kashibhai in her 💥❤️
<a href="">8:37</a> &quot;Aapne hamara maan rakh liya Peshwinbai&quot; What kind of Maan did he have left in him anyway? After horribly breaking the heart of his devoted wife?

Priyanka nailed it...

Kashi neh apni zimmedari or apna dharam ache seh nibhaya I like it
Priyanka is really awesome she lived the role and the best part was that how much she is matured, mannered and dedicated.... I&#39;m really feeling proud to be priyanka&#39;s fan ...😍😍😍😍💜💜💜💜💜 Definitely noone can portray this role as smoothly she did .Don&#39;t compare priyanka with anyone else she is full of talent and motivation , maturity  bkz of her I&#39;m feeling confident to be a girl.❣️❣️❣️❣️

The music starts from <a href="">3:21</a> goosebumps Amazing music

Acting of Priyanka Chopra killed I liked acting of Priyanka

Mastani is very angry
My Peshwa Rupesh Parab❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤❤️❤️❤️❤️ PR
Please show this to Netflix

Love can stand the test of time though we may not understand this from a social perspective the 2 that experienced it understood no material limits could stop their souls

Priyanka is amazing ❤❤

Priyanka stole the show

watching these scenes just makes me sad all over again because of what they did to kashi

Jai Satya Sanatan Dharma
Team Kashi

deepika&#39;s face has a special glow in this movie and that&#39;s because its special effect and editing so stop saying  deepika looks more beautiful in this movie than priyanka . sometimes the filter is too much anyone who do editing will know that especially in the song mohe rang do laal.

The script of the film was actually written for Salman as Bajirao, Asihwarya as Mastani and Rani Mukherjee as Kashi bai.. they all  could have graced the film if things weren&#39;t sore among Salman , Aishwarya and Rani. they could bebetter choices for the film. But Ranveer, Deepika and Specially Priyanka nailed the  characters. Wonderful moive.

So even movie&#39;s name has preysi prevalence.

There is a world of difference between the love of Radhakrishnan and Bajirao Mastani.
As expected......From Radha, Meera to Mastani everyone faced so much humiliation, insult and many other tortures. Pain and jealousy is a sign of absence of love. Ego, possessiveness is the sign of absence of love. But heartless people can follow the man made ideology only. They can&#39;t understand nature, God, love has no boundaries, no rules. Love is God. But Meera received poison from this society for it&#39;s baseless, insensible heartless ideology. Kalyug.....

So real

After reading most of the comment... I think we all know the  level of Priyanka&#39;s Acting.     She has showed her pain without any tear and it&#39;s just 🔥🔥🔥.... No one can match her literally.

I don&#39;t like this radha Krishna dialogue, radha was Krishna ji love before his marriage not like mastani and radha is not mentioned after their marriage like seriously.

This movie is to be Indian and proud my country 🇮🇳

Not a big fan of any one of these actor actresses but have to say.... what an acting..I have watched these scene many times and still it feels perfect to frame the emotion. Amazing acting by allBut Priyanka Chopra was on next level in this character.......

Deepika nothing in front of Priyanka

I can feel true feelings of Kashi.
Only for priyanka 😍

Bajirao Maddani
Radhekrishna, Har Har Mahadev, Jai Shree Ram Ram 🌸🙏🌹🌺💥🌸
Disclaimer : The movie&#39;s name is KashiRao Mastani!PC killed it...💘

&quot;Priyanka&quot; soul of the movie❤❤❤

She talks too much....shame on you Mastani

Bajirao and Mastani are feeling so useless.
After the last dialogue it seems that the wife has no value.
Kashi is one of the strongest female lead I&#39;ve ever seen .

<a href="">10:34</a> kon sa Dil Kaisa Dil.... Priyanka Chopra is amezing actress
90 % people talked about Priyanka Chopra.....Little people ...for Depika....Deepika ki jagah Aish ko lete to char chand lagjata

Because of Priyanka's acting, she has become a complete hero and villain. It is true.
Mother fucker india

Mastani was a person who was portrayed to be warrior and for a warrior showing emotions means showing weaknesses. Kashibai, on the other hand, was a homemaker. She was used to keeping everyone happy, putting others first before herself. Deepika and Priyanka both portrayed these roles well. I don&#39;t get why people compare them. They have different styles of acting and act as per the role. Not to forget, Ranveer did amazingly as well. Bajirao loved both of them and wanted keep them with him forever but due to society, he couldn&#39;t. I felt so many emotions during the last scene. Pity and sympathy for Kashi, Happiness for Bajirao and Mastani as they finally get their happy ending in heaven, and sadness that the movie ended. It definitely is a movie to be watched in a theatre rather than on a tv or mobile. Good work Sanjay Leela Bhansali

Priyanka lived in kashi bhai role . Her eye&#39;s shows the pain of every indian women who faced the situation of kashi bhai  in their real life.

Our hand pkda ....your fuck to nhi .....y TB pt chlta JB kasibayi second sadi krti or 2 husband hota wo bi ek chath k ka hai then bajiraw Mastani Ko PTA chlta hath pkdna or fucking kasa hai.. ...
Nice.....line y kesa Dil AJ uspr kl kisi or pr
I have seen this movie only once. Couldn&#39;t watch it again coz throughout the movie I felt bad for Kashi and didn&#39;t like Bajirao and Mastaani&#39;s relationship.Also, if it&#39;s not okay for a woman to have two or more husbands then why was it okay for a man. Therefore i get an unsettling feeling from this movie. Failed to enjoy and &quot;celebrate&quot; their love. It also remind you how dr was no other option for a woman whose husband has kept another women. It&#39;s just disturbing. Thank god we live in better times.

Actually, if we go by history- Balaji had married Mastani for political reasons, while he did give her respect his relationship with Kashibai didnt change. But ofc, we all know how unrealistic that is- I am not sure if to my contempary brain i can even fathom the heart of a woman who grew up knowing one man- worhsioped him and then suddenly he brings home his &quot;lover&quot;. So what was she all this time?

How much strength does Mastini have? How much strength does she have? How much strength does she have? How much strength does she have?
My wife's hot husband never wanted to be married again..😏
even higher than super
<a href="">6:31</a> looks like kashi bai had the arms in the picture behind her

The whole story should be written by someone who has cheated someone or someone else and then uses the name of love... 👏..... Kashi, 🙂💔.....
Everyone is saying, &quot;Everyone is talking bout mastani and bajirao. No one sees the of Kashi&quot;. Actually everyone is talking bout Kashi, no one is understanding the deep love of Bajirao and Mastani😑

I love kashi bai, she did what a respected lady should do

They put a doll in the cradle. V bad.

Plz upload full movie
Only kashi matters ❤️
The way Bajirao talks to mastani in the middle of water fountain@<a href="">0:48</a> and kasi telling Rao that she is pregnant in bathtub shows kasi is 1/2 of him and completely thinks the way he thinks and lives in pain accepting that he loves mastani more.

Baaki mai bhai kya acting krte hai... Mind blowing why these movies not go for Oscars?

Good

<a href="">05:30</a> savage🔥
Kashi Bajirao Bhallad🙌.
Fata poster turned out to be a hero
Milagia. Shyed

We r made to watch this as a love story , but thinking about kashibai makes me feel upset ! When a woman marries a man she is ready to dedicate anything and everything  inorder to be loved by her man but if he marries another woman , it&#39;s enough to tear her apart and a happy and smiling life meets it&#39;s brutal end ! That woman lives a worthless life till her last breath ! It&#39;s so painful 💔

Can’t stress how Mastani and Rao’s characters are not highly praised. I fell in love with them the moment they met on the fields. They’ve fought all barriers of love and had confessed that there’s no comparison between Kashi and she still doubt it. Along with his mother and brother. Very Unfortunate but quite a way to make an exit when they both took their last breath. It took their lives to make them believe they were meant for each other all along.

<a href="">2:45</a> offfff  ❤❤❤
<a href="">13:39</a>...…..😪😪😪
<a href="">14:43</a>.…...😪😪😪
Literally these two are elegenties of Bollywood ❤️😌

Devdas style. I love this movie too.

Brilliant acting by Priyanka Chopra....the way she showered love on bajirao and the Brilliant way she sacrificed her love so that her husband can be happy with the other lady he loved....is really amazing..the pain of that sacrifice was beautifully portrayed by Priyanka&#39;s actingHowever  Deepika too Brilliantly portrayed the role of mastani...all her sacrifice  and the beautiful fairy tale love story  and the pain beyond that..was amazingly shown by Deepika....honestly after the last conversation of Priyanka and Ranbir...I feel peshwa must have died out of guilt...not the heat...

We want a solo movie based on kashibai, starring Priyanka ❤️❤️❤️
Dipika Padukone jii your eyes very powerful.....❤️
Most gandi line &#39; unhe mera hat pakar liya,  aapka choda to nehi &#39;.. Iss  se jyada bura baat koi ho hi  nehi sakta.. Aise  tham ne se chod dena behat vala hain.

There was a huge love between bajirao and mastani but the love of kashi was way stronger than them. Kashi was such a great woman. I heard after bajirao&#39;s dead mastani committed suicide . She was so self centered that she only thought about loosing her love she didn&#39;t thought how her child would survive without his parents. Thankfully kashi raised her son like her own son. I have watched the film many time but every time after watching kashi&#39;s scenes i feel too bad for her. It was common to marry many womam at that time but only a woman who have a mistress know how it feels. They die withing their heart.

Kashi &lt;3 &lt;3
Omg   <a href="">13:31</a>....

Kashi, don't burn the virtue of words in anger... We can understand your yearning and search for solace... but what to do... Bajirao had fallen in love with Mastani and also fulfilled it...!!🙏🙏😌😌 Still. ... Bajirao is not the name of luxury... 🙂 We like Kumkum Tilak and the sin of fidelity... 😀😀 how Bajirao never thought... Everyone likes Pune so much...
I don&#39;t know how can this kind of love can be idolized! Film ka nam Bajirao Mastani nehi, Kashibai hona chahiye tha

Nice

Kashi 😍😍❤️❤️Bajirao Mastani are overrated. Real struggle was lived by Kashi.
Kashibai&#39;s acting is so good that everytime I watch this movie I cry bouts. It just pierces my soul every fucking time. 🥺🥺😭😭

today i realise that log ka dimag ek hi jagh fas gya hai movie ko movie na soch kr pta nahi konsi soch me ghus jaate hai they only play character and all actors of this movie are awesom deepika periyanka ranveer and costars too

Priyanka Chopra is the best actor

Kashi kashi and only Kashi

No one can play kashibai other than priyanka..she is just amazing. No words for her acting n expression....

Lmao the way this movie sympathises with mastani and puts the peshwas in negative light.

for me the only protagonist, and the only one I see this movie is for the beautiful and noble kashi

The perfect example of how a supporting caste can change the feel of the whole movie. I never sympathized Mastani, all I could ever feel was the helplessness and betrayal Kashi felt. Deepika and Ranveer are indeed fine actors but their acting seemed so monotone and bland in comparison to the gem that is Priyanka&#39;s acting skills.

Miss krishna Daimary BODO

For the entire movie I feel the pain of Kashi bai

Priyanka&#39;s expression voice and her acting tooo good in this movie she desirve more than lead actress 💝🥺

Mastani only made me uncomfortable, this love for someone like you broke the heart of a human being.
sorry but deepikas acting is overrated and priyankas is underrated

I&#39;ve watched this film for mastani but ended up loving kashibai ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kaashi is a best

Ranveer Deepika Priyanka everybody&#39;s acting is superb not only Deepika or Priyanka

I was so emotionally touched by Priyanka&#39;s acting as kashi bai.....she is fabulous we want her to do more hindi period film

Wow wow wow
Everything is so fine about bajirao mastani relation...Only harp is treatment meted to kashi

<a href="">3:14</a>

The title of the movie should be KASHIBAI .

Priyanka&#39;s eyes have more emotions than the whole movie Excellent ❤

Ukkana.thageadhi..vesanam. ,so eppudu same..
Jooshiki chupiyandiraa..
Ee chemistry real couple gaa marichhindhi...

Hi

I always like those characters who sacrifices themselves for whom they love. Bajirao and Mastani both are selfish in love but Kashibai is the one who is selfless, sacrificing and the silent sufferer. She is similar to Chandramukhi in Devdas, Gulabji in Saawariya and Nandini in Hum Dil De Chuke sanam.

Best creation of Bansali sahab. all caractors are the best. best action film . asif they groomed in the charactors. Great creation👌👍

in the comment section all are appreciating hero and heroines but who should be really appreciated more than them is sanjay leela bhansali 😍😃 such a perfect director

Everybody is commenting on kashibai&#39;s character , yes i agree that Priyanka played that role very well But the pain you all are talking about &quot; MASTANI &quot; struggled a lot just to be with bajirao.Bajirao did not disrespect kashibai and also not gave the first wife position to mastaani .Yes priyanka&#39;s pain can also not be avoided but the pain which mastani had to face is far away grom that of Priyanka.😶😶😶

galt shaksh se mohabbat ya bharosa aane waali generation ko kaise effect krti hn...u can see in this movie

ranveer singh - killing eyes .uff

What an irony bajirao known for mastani not for his bravery

Priyanka swallowed everyone with her performance... the reason why she was the only one who successfully transitioned to Hollywod and is India&#39;s main representative in the world... She&#39;s an amazing actress

PC ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT

I didn&#39;t see Mastani and bajirao&#39;s love,i only saw kashi&#39;s pain. Especially in the scene where she sees Mastani and bajirao embracing , her expressions where beautiful. Priyanka stole the character of Kashi,she acted and lived it in every scene. Mastani (Deepika) and bajirao (Ranveer) love was unseen,only Kashi and her pain made this movie beautiful

Priyanaka Chopra❤👏👏👏👏
this is like Indian version of Princess Diana story..Kashi suffered just like she did..When you&#39;re married there is an invisible thread that ties the two, if one feel pain the other will feel It to, if one cheated the other will feel it too..

This Dialogue <a href="">5:55</a>

<a href="">8:20</a> I just love this background music ❤️😭... I feel something abt past ... Makes me cry 😭

All: Kashi was best Me: I&#39;m in love with Bajirao Mastani n Kashibai&#39;s costumes ❤️.... 😁
<a href="">14:23</a> The way she says Che ho ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel so sorry for priyuuu 😭😭😭

Priyanka chopra saw a blue film on big screen in ancient times.. 😂

Her Marathi accent is on point ❤️❤️❤️❤️
<a href="">14:10</a> pain in her voice ❤️
A woman thinks that her man should always be with her.
Accepting everyone in Hindutv is the need of the hour.
Love is not jihad but real love
<a href="">14:28</a> This mad man did not understand the meaning of the law, giving wrong message to the world is dangerous!!!!
Plz add this movie

Priyanka is most gorgeous lady in bollywood

Where can I find this movie?

Seeing this, it seems as if we too should marry and talk like this.
“Tum sunna magar apni dil maila mat karna”
Only Pandit Nehru understood pain of Kashibai and passed Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 prohibiting polygamy

Priyanka was the best in this movie

So nice
&quot;Konsa dil aj ispe agaya kal uspe agaya &quot; this line clearly tells how hurt she was

The real fault was of he had a wife but still loved mastani and mastani blindly fell in love both of them knew he had a wife and he also loved her wife and kashi kept the respect of both of them even though bajirao almost forgot his wife after meeting mastani

History is proved Husband never love her first wife

Priyanka only stolen audience heart not others because she was pain way of expression difference angle 360 view what a active 😍😘😘😘

Man I just wanted to kill both of them. Till the end Kashi made sure to take care of his needs.😭😭

Kashi bai..❤️
He has put my hand on your son, he has done a favor to me by not holding on to me.
Mastaani hugging bajirao disgusts me everytime .what did kashi do to deserve this pain &amp; heartbreak ? Mastani could have a bit self respect &amp; back off .

Sina chauda hojata he jab is film me marathi dialogues sunta hu and priyanka ji ne to marathi words se film ko char chand laga diya i proud to be an Maharashtrian and indian

Dipika charsi o ki sardarni

Most beautiful scene of this movie

Bajirao was only possible because of Mastani Deepika ❤️

Priyanka❤❤🙌🙌
Soo sad for kashi 😭.. depend on real life

Raja binny bhat
Gosh...Priyanka..u r the only one.. 💯❤️❤️❤️❤️
Priyanka nailed this character ... ....

Priyanka didn't agree with anyone like that.
<b>🇧🇩SAD🦉😡, ALLAH  SAVE  ALL  PEOPLE&#39;S 🤭🇧🇩🇧🇩</b>
Shame on Bajirao he didn&#39;t realise that what he did with kashibai

Outstanding performance by deepika

I don’t understand how people can differentiate same situations and show hatred as per their religion. They say heartless king and bad to Bajirao because he had 2nd wife Mastani whereas these people loved Joda-Akbar love story whereas Jodha is Other wife same as Mastani.Mastani and Jodha Bai weren’t first wives.But in jodha akbar movie (with hrithik roshan and aishwarya rai) They showed wrong that joda is the first wife and the only one just to give her respect and love.But in Bajirao mastani they enhanced Bajirao’s first wife pain in deep to degrade mastani.Otherwise mastani has joined with her own sword bajirao in battles wars to support her husband being on his side being in same troubles for their people as bajirao wanted.This part they didn’t show in the movie lol 😂  but in jodha akbar movie they show sword scenes for jodha to give her respect.In movies they showed proper marriage of jodha  akbar but not in bajirao mastani where the written history tells us the same detailed ritual wedding was performed for mastani and bajirao as well.So people don’t judge accordingly to what are shown in the movies ;because movies shows love, respect (for jodha) and pain of first wife (bajirao’s first wife also hindu) only weighing one side !!!And not the other side !!Sacchi Kahani ke hamesha 2 pehlu hote hain !If there was pain for bajirao first wife which makes people feel hatred for bajirao and degraded mastani then there was also deep pain from akbar’s first wife because of Jodha the same should be felt for Jodha as well.Akbar’s first wife pain they hide it from the movie not to degrade jodha lol 😂 because she was hindu but mastani was shown guilty because she was Muslim.THE LOVE STORIES and the SITUATIONS ARE EXACTLY SAME so Same Respect and Love are deserved to Bajirao Mastani as it is for Joda-Akbar’s Love Story ❗️If mastani is bad because of bajirao’s first wife’s pain then Jodha should have been equally considered bad for giving Akbar’s first wife pain ‼️ but these people love their jodha-akbar love story and all hatred and criticism are for mastani and bajirao-mastani love story. Disgusting thinking of such people.

There is emotion and pain in both the characters of Priyanka and Deepika, but I considered Priyanka's character to be the best, there is emotion and pain of love in Deepika's character, I knew that the pain of love is difficult, both of them have shown true love. But there is pain in Priyanka's heart, she is a wise woman, having become a wife, marrying another woman is a betrayal, Mastani also knew that Bajirao has a wife, then he loved her and Bajirao fell in love with his wife's lover, she cheated, neither of them understood the pain of his heart, he became blind just because of love, I can't accept this extra marital affairs character🐶
Khasi
Bajirao is  low-life cheater and mastani is useless homewrecker Kashi is the true higher-self !!!

Har har Mahadev= goosebumps ❤️🚩":"
In this movie priyanka kill it...

In this movie priyanka kill it...

Priyanka Chopra
I personally think that kashi bai should demand a separate movie but with priyanka only

Peshwa cheated and that distroyed everything

People r really have double mindset here they r feel kashi&#39;s pain and other hand they enjoy jodha akbar story forget rukiyaa begam pain 😃😃

But why this movie is not on youtube hey I want to see full movie😣plz upload kardijiy🙏from Nepal🇳🇵
Any woman can share anything but she will not want to share her husband's love.
So beautiful❤❤❤❤❤
All I can play in my head is When Shreya performed Deewani Mastani

No matter what you say, it is wrong for a wife to think about another, it is a sin to think about her, a girl can share everything, not her husband.
Priyanka&#39;s epic acting and showing emotional pain of kashibai in her eyes is sufficient to remember this movie for kashibai ❤️

Good to see har har mahadev Mastani sahiba ❤️👍
I&#39;m from South, I didn&#39;t understood this language ,,,but I feel the acting  ! priyanka is amazing👌

Best movie ❤️❤️❤️
I love my best actors ❤️❤️❤️ Ranveer Dipika
Oh, you are piercing me too much
Millions invested in this film but couldn&#39;t use a real baby, 🤦‍♂️<a href="">4:26</a> and how priyanka held that toy baby, can&#39;t decide what&#39;s worse.

I just noticed that tear from the male lead on <a href="">15:50</a>

Priyanka very well act.....some woman's pain and humiliation are shown very nicely...another woman's pain is very painful, why are such men shown in history?
Kashi bai ❤️❤️❤️ ..... Mastani 👎👎
No one can play this role better than Priyanka. You are awesome.

It was very difficult for kashibai💔

What is Priyanka ji?
This is very wrong. Men can mary twice and society criticizes only but when a women has two husband she is called characters less. We have no such examples of history where a women exist and had two husband.

Deepika is looking more beautiful in this movie than Padmavati

All best scenes were of kashi... hats off to Priyanka.. she did a better job than the leads 😇😁

Sanjay leela bhansali.... The only great director of recent era hindi fim industry

Apne to hamara gurur hi ...

Idk why but i m not liking how Priyanka has acted, she looks like me when I am told to act n i start overacting n my lips go on one side...

dialogues are A1.....🔥🔥🔥🔥
Home breaker : Mastani
Phew🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those who are able to wake up, they can also meet us.
Priyanka .. as a kashi uff  uff

Love love love ... Pain pain pain only pain 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
I feel kashi&#39;s pain overshadowed the love interest of Bajirao Mastani and I as an audience is more sympathized towards kashi ...kudos to Priyanka, her acting we actually felt the pain....

<a href="">15:43</a> even a blind can see the pain in her eyes❤️<a href="">14:08</a> pain in her voice ❤️

Everyone is talking about Kashi. But I am not talking about any lover who wants to see me.

My favorite actress priyanka

Priyanka stole the show. Her expression, voice control. Perfectly delivered.

It is so funny when first you show the person as very great in terms of all aspects and other side of that person is so cheap.both mastani and bajirao are double standard

I like Priyanka Chopra acting.
Priyanka&#39;s sacrifice ❤️❤️❤️💝💝💝
To wield a sword better than our own.
It is so painful to watch this movie. It is painful to watch. I don't know why God doesn't help me. I don't know what is the value of it.
lovely scene

Deepu is gorjeous

12:55 Gazab taunts you with all your might.
Polygamie ……aïe ……really hard when you love someone and think that you’re the ONE 😓😓

Priyanka character was awesome 👌

Telugu lo dubbing cheyandi pls
imagine the yodhaa who never got defeated ...but people know him as lover ..because of this foolish movie.....har har mahadev

She is right one wife one husband NOT many! Elder wife what a lot of crap again he is only allowed one the 2nd is his mistress NOT WIFE! I am glad I don’t spent money watching this crap sold by the CORRUPT BOLLYWOOD!

Tremendous work

Mastani ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mastani❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kamal ki acting hain prinka or ranveer singh ki

Priyanka much acted well then anyone else in the movie

Priyanka. My love
Mastani deserved everything that came her way if this story is entirely true. She talks as though she hasnn;t done anything wrong, and Deepika&#39;s acting is ugh

cool
Loved the scenes ♥️🥰😇

Brilliant  dialogs 👍👍👍👍
Deepika killed the character............. Priyanka lived the characterHats off to priyanka

nice video like that .👤badia act to all of act_actress go way to b countinuied god bless have a  nice day

Mastani 🤩
Priyanka literally lived kashi&#39;s role and made it so real .

<a href="">12:28</a> this whole scene is my favourite ❤️

Priyanka man
Dil kaisa dil is amazing

Ndea wants to see Bajirao Mastani again
How has deepika acted so bad ...like just anticipate that you are the lead .

Kashibai would have been in deep pain. No woman can tolerate second woman in her husband&#39;s life.

There is a hint in my mind that PC is complete...damn born actress
Priyanka 💖💖
WE NEED SUBTITLES PLEASE

Nice

I felt bad for Mastani. Nobody was by her side, where Kashi had everyone including her husband on her side. Mastani was insulted and as a wife of Bajirao she deserves as same as Kashi bai. But she was not treated the same way. Her children was under istimated. Finally they killed her.Everyone talking about how Kashi took care of Mastani&#39;s child...! I&#39;d rather say, what if Mastani was alive and take care of her own children?

I just loved the acting of three gems

thats why i am a pc fan. love herrrrrrr

<a href="">14:43</a> what an acting 🔥 🔥 🔥
Sundar Priyanka Chopra Deepika Padukone Ranbir Kapoor

Bhansali&#39;s best movie so far.
Prianka Mam most beautiful talented actress in the world 🥰🥰🥰

I just finished watching this movie and can&#39;t help but feel bad for Kashi 😭

priyanka priyanka bas khuch bolaneki jarurat nahi.
This film is a must watch. All actors/actresses, dialogues, costumes, family, fight, love, couple painful scenes are so beautifully presented. For me, everyone deserves an award.

Pp

I love how everyone is hating the extra marital affair! Love you guys all.

Deepika and priyanka are alone powerful than male actors .... they have established female power in Bollywood

Deepika has such blunt expressions and speaks as she has choking in her throat. Expressionless acting, while Priyanka gave so much expressions and feel to her character

Bansali&#39;s sets 😍😍😍😍
Worst dialogue delivery by deepika padukone...She don&#39;t even know where to take pause ..😂😂😂

This is not love story..It&#39;s a story about cheating, betrayal ...

Aditi Rao is suitable for Mastani character

I think that line should be like this &quot;ye swagat sirf iss chokhat per hua hai dil toh tut gaya humara&quot;

Mp ki

The movie was meant to portray the love story of bajirao and mastani ...instead it became the tale of kashis sacrifices

PC❤️❤️
An epic movie,  has to say that, each and every character is very well defined, we don&#39;t see much more of cinema like this nowadays, everything is so perfect, one of my favourite of all-time.

This movie teaches us that if we talk to anyone other than our wife, we will remain alive.
Priyanka is looking the best... how sad that woman will be.
I love this movie a lot❤️

He took my hand when I said it to you...Hmse rista joda h par apse toda to ni...Ye dialogue to aisa lag raha hai jaise kaashi pe ke asaan ho diya ho...😤😤😤
Priyanka is just awesome...

Mujhe personally mastani ni pasand aai usne ek aachi si family barbad kr di...😢😢😢

I would Love to have some English sub titles pls.  That would be awesome !!

Nautanki
Don&#39;t like gang totally boycott

Dipika loved her

Glory to the woman, don't worry about the pride of the woman.
Long live Sanatan Sanskriti!
Jai ho hindutev kee
This hotel is looking for a Hindu woman.
How did these people behave? Such is the way great Bajirav of Hindutva lived.
These are the teachings of Hindu religion.
If Sushant were playing rao,s role then d film would b more popular, ranveer doesn&#39;t fit in this role,priyanka did good job in this film

There is no one clean in these shores of the ocean, everyone is drowning, there is sorrow and pain,
I can feel the pain of kashibai.....💔

Priyanka Chopra 💖 OMG Amazing actress.

Super 👌👌👌
What a besharam story of Bajirao n besharam mastani bai

Ye to glt h ikk bv k hote hue doosri so painful
Priyanka Chopra is better actress than Dipika padukon

Priyanka Chopra is the best actress in the wold I love priyanka

Fantastic Dialog

<b>REALLY PROUD TO SEE THAT HOW A HINDU RAJA READILY ACCEPTED OTHER RELIGION DESPITE GOING AGAINST THE FAMILY BECAUSE OF</b> HIS WIFE AND  EVEN ACCEPTED TO CHILD TO  FOLLOW OTHER RELIGION(PROVING IT IS NOT FOR SOME PURPOSES ND ALL) * <b>VASUDEV KUTUMBAKAM AT ITS BEST🙏🙏🙏🙏</b>
Priyanka ❤️❤️
What a fabulous background of this movie🔥

One can be victorious against world but will be defeated by ours own

Kashi's pain😑
Maturity is when you realise the pain of Kashi instead of Bajirao and Mastani ❤️

Priyanka Chopra!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Deepika I love Ranveer , I love Bajirao and Mastani!! where are the deepveer fans ?  I DON&#39;T COMPARE BUT THE MOVIE MOVED ME BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEADING PLAYERS, NOT BY PRYANKA , deepika is queen for mi!!!!

Love you PC❤️❤️❤️
Thank God we live in such a time in which second marriage is not illegal.
That pain in priyanka&#39;s eyes is unmatchable! 💯😍

Priyanka&#39;s acting👏👏😘😘kashibai 👏
Kasibai is the name of sacrifice.,.she care n sacrifice her whole life for peshwa....but nobody understand this....peshwa is romancing with mastani....he forget everything sacrifice n love of kasibai...only for other woman....this is so injustice to kasibai...

You are absolutely right, I married whoever I wanted and it rained on me not just once but again and again.
Wah kai acting mast
Priyanka far far better than Deepika love u priyanka

In the whole movie....I felt like crying and annoyed whenever Mastani and Bajirao scene used to come ....that just reminded me of Kashi Bai&#39;s pain .....

Loved comments

And this is what Kashibai did to use and presented it as a disgusting thing 😀😄
I like Priyanka role..becoz she sacrifices her life for her husband..I like her emotions..❤️❤️moreover her acting fabulous..

The way Kashi hided her pain in front everyone. That was deep pain. Any stone-hearted person could break too 🙂💔

Priyanka nailed it

The comments section makes me proud bcoz... Everyone&#39;s comments is &#39;Kashibai&#39;... I also love the charecter Kashi... Superb actor&#39;s Priyanka... ❤❤❤

Priyanka role super How a woman fulfills her duty of keeping her pain inside her eyes
This scene....I mean hats off to Priyanka..

I am totally speechless❤❤❤❤❤❤
Priyanka Chopra's acting or expression is very different, what dialogue is there?
Love is blind I agree,,bt being a wyf I really feel bad for kashi..I can never see my hsbnd in any one&#39;s arm as love except me....so Deepu is my fav bt in this movie kashi&#39;s character is more fav for me

Idk know it&#39;s my fault or not but I can&#39;t see the love story of bajorao and mastani but I can only see kashibai&#39;s pain in whole movie😭😭😭

After watching this movie of Sanjay Leela Bansali, what is the direction of the entire movie, what is the shooting or what is the editing done?
India ka super actress PC

Illegal broo

Who can stop this...?
Priyanka Chopra nailed her character and overshadowed all the characters done by other actors

They are so pretty

Even eros now that they can gain views if they have Priyanka’s clip put together ..... did u guys observe that

PRIYANKA CHOPRA❤
Kashibai has suffered the most and she is d best character.. Periid

Before my mother I as daughter would killed  mastani... In today&#39;s world....

Kashibai stole the show💕💕
Love you pc
Priyanka is unbelievable ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful ❤️
Priyanka acting 👌👌👌 @ <a href="">12:30</a>
@ <a href="">14:41</a> Priyanka Chopra&#39;s acting....no words for her 👌👌❤️❤️
Priyanka stoled Deepika&#39;s thunder

I knew from the start, like the day I watched the movie back in 2016 that this whole relationship was a <i>mess</i> between Kashibai, Bajirao and Mastani like GOD the agony Kashibai must&#39;ve felt.... it was present throughout the <i>whole</i> movie, even in the music videos for the songs like for Deewani Mastani. sheesh. I may not be the biggest fan of Priyanka but I can&#39;t deny that she killed this role.

The comments disputing between who’s more right or wrong in the story. I don’t blame Mastani, Bajirao or Kashi. In those times, having multiple wives as a king was acceptable so I blame the society. Bajirao might have loved Mastani more than Kashi but he still loved and adored Kashi. If society had let them be, they would have lived contently especially with a soul like Kashi. We don’t choose who we fall in love with, it’s how the love is handled that matters. Mastani and Bajirao handled theirs selfishly, they’re guilty of that yes but love is not a reason to die or to be hated AT ALL. The fact that Mastani was able to move Bajirao would tell you enough that Bajirao loved Kashi but not immense enough to remain only hers. Whether Mastani had followed him or not, he was already enthralled by her since before she came to him herself. If he was allowed to love both of them, he would have done right by both. Mastani also knew what she was getting herself into and had accepted Kashi with her entire heart as part of Bajirao and respected her.

I think Deepika&#39;s acting was best

in every scenes Priynka kill us

So Deepika’s poor acting is cloaked by good sad makeup and heavy costumes..

Everyone agreed that Bajiirao&#39;s second marriage was not accepted.  That should leave Isannapura in the clear as he was half of Alauddin and not Bajiirao.  Thank you.🌹🌹

Asked if Isannapura was half of Bajiirao then married to the terrrorist.  Isannapura was half of Alauddin...nothing was mentioned of Bajiirao except for the military school.  Terrrorist said prejudise.  They could go back to their own world if they cannot live in the free world.  Chinese president said they could always go back to China why did they flee China...that no one could feed these people.  India agreed.  Yes.  Terrorist are trying to claim PhD for their children from Harvard.  All these time?  People asked.  They said no with that they will rule the world.  Russia said their wife got fake degree from Thailand.  They said to see who is fake who is real they will test it at the vaccine site.  Thailand said she should be pulled out.  Former President Clinton said, Don&#39;t mind if I do.  Thailand the sponsor of their education had put out their notice.  Thank you.  Asked how she should be pulled out?  They said completely.  They said done!  Thank you.

Finally, Russsian President&#39;s wife said Bajiirao&#39;s second marriage with Mastani is not accepted...as it linked to terrorism.  Agreed.  India said they never saw Mastani existed even...all the sudden terrorist in pairs showed up to get married as the best in the world...especialy in education.  Not sure what they have created to back up their education...their schools cannot endorse them even.  Thank you.

No matter how much higher remuneration deepika takes but in talent she cannot beat her seniors spcly priyanka and kareena really Bollywood will never change chamchagiri karne vallonko star banadetha hey

Too much pain ...  😖🥺 Anyone who face Priyanka&#39;s role in real life 😅😂

Mindblowing dil chugaya priyanka 😘😘❤❤
Priyanka Chopra is beautiful and bast

14.52 eyes of pc 😍😍🖤🖤

PC was a strong woman in the film as she is in real life.

Priyanka chopra is so mature actressProud to be a fan of pc

Okay I know this is not the popular opinion here but I should share it anyway Incase it resonates with people who’re afraid to share this particular opinion in order to save their grace from certain type of vicious attacks from one direction minded individuals . Yes priyanka as an actress played whatever she’s been given to dealt with excellently, and yes her chemistry with ranveer here is brilliant so were some scenes and the grace she portrayed. BUTTo the defense of mastani and bajairo story, people need to understand that it so happens that people do fall in love with each other and I know for the larger balanced minded robotic people it feels anarchy but it’s not, it’s LIFE. THIS IS HOW GOD DO HIS WORK. This is the bigger picture which we humans don’t see often. We’re all stuck with the mindset that girl boy meets and fall in love or stuck in arranged marriages no matter theirs feelings toward each other or how miserable they be SHOULD spend the rest of life together for the sake of so called respect in this screwed up society and KIDS. Nobody realizes that this is the very first thing which is wrong. This society is so mechanical that it refuses to accept that we humans are not robots, we are emotional beings and our evolution and our lives are based on our emotions. We’ve been taught from a very young age to just fit the fucked up standards of society. I can assure you about more than 90% of people reading this comment has parents who were better off getting a divorce n marrying someone who they’d be happy with. A child can sense more than we give them due, kids growing up in a situation where the love between their parents is (from  least affection to none whatsoever) can sense it even if they don’t show it. Please stop glorifying fucked up marriages. This needs to stop or we’ll keep on having generation upon generations of robots who have no clue about love between loving partners/parents and the pleasantries it brings. There’s one comment I’ve heard from Sarah ali Khan where when asked about her parents divorce, she said it’s better to have two happy homes than one miserable hell. Trust me she spoke the absolute truth here, it’s high time we all acknowledge this reality. Bajirao here is do at fault, he should’ve divorced kashibai and kashibai should’ve married someone who’d love her the way bajirao loves mastani, fierce and passionate. Please don’t glorify miserable first wives or husbands who don’t understand that their partner has moved on in their heart with someone else ( and IT REALLY IS TRUE THAT THE HEART COULD NOT BE STOPPED FROM MOVING ON IF IT OCCURS) and they should accept it and leave gracefully, not to stick around and pretend victim. All my lovely human beings out there, understand this cuz it’s how the God works. It’s getting too long and I know I’ve missed a few points but for now this is it from me. Just a sane reminder!

I was about to watch something else but it made me watch till end🥰

ranveer, deepika n priyankaa is on fire ,,,,,,

Priyanka stole the show

Asi movie maine abtak keu nehi dekhi.....mujhe to afsos ho rahi he....

Sometimes I feel Deepika&#39;s acting is not from within herself... don&#39;t know but sometimes I  can&#39;t feel her acting is real.... otherwise she is good

It is said that Priyanka has done a good role but no one who has written the script has the right to say anything about Shreemati Radharani or Shree Krishna 😡😡. Or Rasleela they also know what Rasleela means or not. It was there that I heard the name of Radharani and I just raised my mouth and said that the marriage of Radhakrishnan has taken place. There is also a place in Vrindavan where Swam Brahma ji has got the marriage of Radhakrishnan done. But few people should give this excuse to tarnish the name of Radhakrishnan 😡😡😡. Shame should be given to such people who write even small things without saying anything.
Jai Shivarai
I really feel bad for Kashibai

Kashi was so proud of his Rao that he would not even look at any woman other than him, but Bajirao killed Kashi with the name Mastani, who gave him a never-ending pain.
priyanka chopra just nailed the character

These bollywood are great sinners, they have made a great emperor a Devdas. History is capable of showing us how many true things we will learn from polygamy.
Priyanka's acting is getting better
PC❤️😘
damn...i wud hv killed mastani had i been in kashibai k plc

PC ur dailogue made me cry really ur dailogue haeve the entire movie

Ur eyes says the pain .....I&#39;m the big fan ever PC mm

Jusk killed in frame I never see to anyone

Pc ur one dailogue sidhi dil pe
My eyes were glued to Priyanka....the pain in her eyes....god her acting is so exceptional...!!

The way Kashibai is written is much more complex than Mastani too. It&#39;s very human how Kashi feels so conflicted. She&#39;s not a bad person, but she&#39;s hurt. I love how that&#39;s so clear in Priyanka&#39;s acting.

I have to say this, but one was an illegitimate daughter who became an illegitimate wife, and the other was a cherished daughter who became a proud wife...one had to take her choices because of her circumstances, other made her choices for her duty, they are both strong women portrayed beautifully. I like them both....i just don&#39;t like the man, he somehow seems irresponsible towards both of them (typical men)

The pain in Kashi’s eyes. I just can’t

Why should I complain to people when I feel uncomfortable (Priyanka Chopra)😭😭😭💯🙏
The producer make this only entertainment but he ruined bajirav’s path for his nation’s bhakti . Bajirav ia the great worrier for his kingdom m bharat , and producer saws him love looser .. but its not true its totally wrong. Even mastani doesn’t want like that in original story because she is also a great worrier for his kindom part in bharat. They don’t have any attachments... this producer no good thatswhy he ruined padmaavti story and thatswhy public doesn’t want to see his any movie...

In that movie, the producer saws mastani ‘s story ia totally wrong way

Deepika is nothing infront of priyanka and she proved it in this movie....

I would never want to stay somewhere i was not welcomed

Which heart?? Whose heart???
Priyanka &#39; s One of the best movie Forever  and ever.... Movie me tin super star the but I jest sow Priyanka. Her amazing acting... 😍😍😍😍😍😍

Bajirao mastni is another tale n saga of true love

Whatever a woman does is wrong, whatever a man does is right, whatever Bajirao did, if Kashibai does it, she becomes infamous.
Kashi is the real hero in this movie

stupid question asked by an ignorant: But was the veil somehow fixed on the head? Because I really don&#39;t know how to keep it on your head without slipping it every 2 seconds!

Mastani was mentally prepared to share her husband for being Muslim. It’s nearly impossible for a hindu women.

Kashi bai is much more stronger than mastani. It needs a lot of courage to share your husband.

Don&#39;t just appreciate Priyanka chopraEveryone it a wonderful full jofAnd Sanjay Leena bhanushali Just make amazing movies❤️❤️❤️

Man like this you are hot😭
Mastani&#39;s character was the most irritating one ,literally she is giving justifications that maybe bajirao loved me but didn&#39;t leave you kashi😒

Assalamualicum...

They change history kashibai was not this much bitter she even accepted mastani peshwas mother created all mess but not kashibai she brought up mastanis child after her death

Husband wife ke beech kbhi 3rd person koi nhi ana chahiye

People don't consider Priyanka a good actor and don't get tired after watching this scene 🤣
Priyanka's Marathi wa mast was superb 😁👍Mastani ke ladka liye i feel sad in the end 😭will break up after marriage 😭🙄
<a href="">4:00</a>

The lady who played Bhibai ( Bajirao&#39;s sister) then played Bajirao&#39;s mother in the Sony series Bajirao

Who else is the fan of Dipika Padukone she is damn good....... She is my favourite of favourites❤️❤️❤️

She can never give blessing because she doesn&#39;t deserve to give blessing because she is a bad soul

Mastani is known her vulgarity she is the person who is selfish And ready to breakanyones household to make her own household

Pair me chomti ka seen

Druggist girl🤬🤬
Priyanka has hit out of the park with this movie. It wasn’t that Deepika was bad, but sometimes brilliance shadows everything.

Wen u see ur husband I love other is tromatic

Yes I believe the same she is one class act in the Hindi world and probably in the whole world you damn good she makes things seem so real.

Priyanka is best artist 👍❤️
Priyunka acting looks far betr dan dipi...just superbb pc..dil jit liya
Aapne to hamara gurur hi chheen liya..best dialogue

No offense but the last dialogue is literally lit ❤ I love it

hats off to Priyanka&#39;s acting 💕❤️😀

It&#39;s really good to have your mother-in-law on your side 🙂🙃

I love Deepika 💚💛 she&#39;s OSM
Mastani is such a bitchy character who is trying to be good by being a loose character, first she steals someone else's wife and then tries to be friends with her wife.
Deepka opposite Aishwarya Rai mind-blowing

Very beautiful

Priyanka&#39;s acting skills are next level

I AM A FAN OF DEEPIKA AND PRIYANKA.

<a href="">1:31</a>

Priyanka dance &amp; acted well this Movie than deepika

This bollywood boycotted prinka for having affair with sharukh they punished prinka not sharukh

Shemsher bahadur who was the son of  bajirao and mastani  after death of parents kashibai bought him and made him yodha kashibai was the great lady

Priyanka n deepika is amazing ♥️

<a href="">12:28</a> most emotional scene🥺🥺💔
PC won

How much ever one tries to say it was love between Bajirao and Mastani, being a Muslim even I can easily say it was just infedility, lust and nothing else...What both of them did was hurtful atleast to the 1st wife of Bajirao. Mastani was correctly shamed for luring a married man into her. But that was very common during that era. Kings use to keep 💯&#39;s of wives...Cannot imagine that now... God knows how women use to tolerate this before...I was so disgusted about the entire story concept where they glorified someone&#39;s infedility as a love story and sold it to the audience that is reason  I  never watched full movie until now and I am glad after watching this movie scene that I never did...Only Bollywood can sell such crap

Wow great, this movie is dedicate to my qt  hopefully would be  Ex husband from me

I can&#39;t imagine anyone other than priyanka for kashibai.She is amazing❤❤

AND PEOPLE SAY THAT BOLLYWOOD IS NOT GOOD😑😒 JUST LOOK AT THE ACTING SKILLS. THEY ARE FANTASTIC😍💞💞
why does he stand in the water fountain in one of these scenes?

Bajirao mast an I nice

Nice Jodhi
Priyanka&#39;s acting is excellent ❤️

I watched movie and felt bad for trio, let me explain whyKashi - one who never escaped from duty and truely loved Bajirao. She indeed possesive about her love n she poured her entire life for keeping Bajirao n family happy. But betrayal hurt her so deep, she wanted to shout on her fate but helplessly held herself intact for her children.Mastani - yes, you heard right. She saw her soulmate in Bajirao and blindly followed him to carry out her duties, being unrealistic she jumped to well. Since she bought up in system polygamy is legal. Well, she suffered being isolated, disrespect, and zero support from anyone other than Bajirao. At least, if she got Kashi&#39;s umbrella she would have outperformed everywhere. No, she suffered hell too, but it is self made.Bajirao - in fact this suffering is highlighted in movie, n climax shows how family problems can impact on ones life. Bajirao, never stepped back from enemies but, he could not face his own family. He wanted to combine Mastani with his family but he was disappointed by the treatment for her to the extent of paying his own life.Yes, man may be strong outside, but strength lies inside because of his family.Everyone suffered but in different way, a love should bring families together, should think of impact on current system and its outcome. If its not thought thoroughly, and if u just jump blindly because u love water, u dont know what is the depth beneath if u r unlucky it can kill u n ur dependents leaving long lasting pain.Oh yes this was n epic movie. Has many dimensions to think n adapt. 🙂

Best couple ❤️🔥 Ranveer and deepika❤️
I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t love  bajirao mastani 🤔bt Kashi is love 🥰

Everyone knows the pain of mastani but no one knows the pain of kashi bai the untold one

I can feel the pain of priyanka..... She s just nailed the character  omg... Unbelievable ❤

Hi guys welcome to my channel 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

as khasi bai,Priyanka&#39;s best acting in her hole life
Superb

Priyanka looks awesome as marathi peshvinbai❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Deepika Padukone looking great in Arabic outfit.❤️❤️Ranveer Singh is rocking and acting is just fab..❤️❤️❤️
Priyanka is just outstanding in this movie ❤️❤️😭😍😍

Muslim angle always put in whether real or not! Playing with our history

<a href="">1:22</a> ye fountain kaise chal raha? Us waqt motor to thi nahi 😐

Plz upload this movie

Not gonna lie but I prefer Priyanka over Deepika .
I love mastaani and her dialogs are just awesome 👌

I hated mastani and Bajirao so much

I discover bollywood because of this movie and deepika

Deepika is no where close to Priyanka .! 🤩🤩🤩

Priyanka Chopra is just amazing and very talented.

There is no mean abt fake love....everytime love is true...in before days a king married more girls but there r lot of different between relationship and love

Kashibai and Tanvi Azmi❤️

Priyanka Chopra -no doubt she is an evergreen actress ❤️

Wow

Kashi is also not wrong from her side though-

Deepika is not looking good with her dress

It was clear that movie wanted the audience to fall in love with mastani-bajirao but I ended up falling in LOVE with kaashi bai ❤️In fact I kinda hated mastani-bajirao at some instances🤭

Good

2. :43 unbelievable technology
Priyanka did a mind blowing job in dis beautiful film

Priyanka  is more beautiful than depika charsi

Priyanka beautiful acting.....

Idiot deepika....other
I ❤️ Kashi more than Mastani

This comment section has made my day!!! Cheers! Guys you all are love☺☺☺

Don&#39;t know why everytime i watch this movie, I cry for priyanka, sorry for kaashi... Yes nobody can share her husband with anyone... but she deserves a salute... Hats off ❤

It seems he is happy with your arrival... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well how to romantisize something should be learnt from stupid Bollywood lmaoo....it was a political alliance lol

Priyanka... brings life to the character of Kashibai... touching performance ❤️🥰

<a href="">14:35</a> ...What an Brilliant Performance by Priyanka...oh God..!!Live Long Priyanka as Kashibai😍😍

I don&#39;t know about anything else But everytime I watch this movie I can feel the pain of real kaashi through priyanka.... Every time when Bajirao expresses his immense love for mastani, I actually feel bad for Kaashii

How mean.the title should be&quot; kaashibai&quot;as she sacrificed the most

After this movie, Priyanka became my favourite actress.

Deepika ♥️♥️❤️
Film name is BAJIRAO MASTAANI but People are more obsessed with KASHI...❤️❤️❤️

If I was kashi I might have poisoned both.

Why does Deepika get the role of a devil in every movie, she is also in Padmavat and in the ghost movie too 😜😜😜
Glorification of blatant love jihad, and infidelity in a single film. Deepika just shamelessly tries to justify both the things throughout, this is why Bollywood has gone to the dogs.

Everyone is talking about kashi character is good, yes it is no doubt. But I really like mastani character personally don&#39;t know why and the way she handles all the huddles and still stood for her love. Yes people says he is married, but if u see from mastani&#39;s side it is not wrong thing to marry a married person. Those are the things she saw from childhood. Anyway everyone should appreciate her seniority towards love. But very sad reality is that no one likes her just because mostly people sees it like illegal relationship, but technically it&#39;s not......

Mastani sahiba 😍😍😍
Here true love is in Priyanka cause true love is not about getting him/her but let him/her go with there happiness no matter how much pain you are getting while watching him/her going

Kitne kamine hote hai mard.....kashi ne bola dubara is kamre mei mat aana.....he said ok...... Kashi ko manane ki koshish to karta.....pyaar to usase bhi kiya tha rao ne

omg...priyanka😍😍😍😍👌👌👌👌
Emotional overload only...great kings great dynasties in bollyweed are shown for just affairs, emotions n heavy dialogues n expressions... something we don&#39;t witness in normal lives

Its&#39;s all mastani&#39;s fault. Why she come to pune???? . For just her love. Her love destroyed an country and culture,a family.

Each and avery one played there role amazingly matlab aisa lag hi nahi raha tha ki deepika priyanka ya ranveer play kar rahe hain

Priyanka's acting &quot;Guroor&quot; two hours have passed
Deepika perfect match as mastani...

🙏🏻 bht acha lgta he ye movie
What fun would you have in someone else's husband's mind?
That Bhansali not only took the trouble to find a good entertainer, he took that drug queen keeping in mind the box office. In the film...?
This  is like radha and Krishna

Please Full movie dalo🙏🙏

Very amazing acting priyanka chopra 👌👌👌👌
Don't watch any movie of this logo 🙄
He was married, why Mastani thought that she can do something like this.

Thora thora dp looks like kiara advani
10/10💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎Priyanka 💌
Which heart... what heart... This line ❤️❤️❤️
This is my favorite scene too
Priyanka chopra amazing😍🤩🤩😍 i
Priyanka Priyanka And Priyanka👍
Pc is fabulous 👌👌 her acting is superb 👌
Despite of being cheated by her husband..she didn&#39;t leave him..I mean that&#39;s the example of love...

Very bad scene,he was married and we support this type of love...shame

One of the most favorite movie which make me imotional

Priyanka is just awesome ❤️🔥🤩
Priyanka did justice to kashibai&#39;s role... She was fabulous... I was almost in tears by seeing kashibai&#39;s tragedy...

Really heartbreaking 😭

Don&#39;t call her Muslim.....o plz Muslim women are not allowed to marry any Non. Muslims...if she will marry it&#39;s the same as if she will live with him without marriage.Above all both are toooooo selfish.

Kashi is such a pure soul and priyanka played that in a subtle way only if Ekta Kapoor was the creator she would&#39;ve moulded the character like some typical &#39; JEALOUS SAUTAN&#39; But Priyanka did justice to the role

Love never fades even he loves someone else .....Mastani loved the way he is wt Kashi couldn’t do ....Responsiblities &amp; duties &amp; admiring Kashi ne kiya  lekin ...acceptance nai every question has an answer in this movieLove is not shifted / faded with a person’s  actions ....it just stays within you ...Once think if at all everyone accepts her as a family .....how would the story be ....Death even can’t separate love .....human / religion/ beliefs Kay karogi .....Those who know the meaning of love can accept ....human / husband is not a piece of object to own / possess ....they give pain what Mastani could bear but not Kashi

how can bajirao leave a loving wife for mastani

I don&#39;t like these kind of movies/dramas/ books A man if have married someone he should only devote himself to the women and vice versa.Why you married someone if you cannot love her/him.The women Mastani is also in fault here Loving a married man is a sin according to me.It&#39;s absurd I haven&#39;t watched the movie knowing the plot

Priyanka woow.. I never lykd her before but after cing her in this movie.. She is amazing

The best performance was from priyanka chopra Her acting her dressing her everything was wonderful

Wow❣️
Omg priyanka&#39;s eyes
i dont understand  how bajirao and mastani were worshipped....and i dont understand  how they are portraying themselves....unbelievable......priyanka was incredible

Priyanka steals the show from Deepika

Can anyone explain the movie too me please so that I can watch if I am interested 🤞🏻🥺🥺🥺

No expressions in Deepika

The thing I must say here is that  I possess feelings not only towards Kashi bai but to Mastani as well as both of these women loved Pashoa whole heartedly but it&#39;s Peshoa or men&#39;s polygamic nature I feel never can give these tow women their due respect.  Loving both of them equally is not the matter of discussion here rather it&#39;s all about respecting women, and by marrying both of them you can not pay this &quot;respect&quot; to any of them. And this disrespect can&#39;t lead you to the &quot;LOVE&quot; so this loveing equally is nothing but a fake Ideal❤️👍

Priyanka fan❤️
Priyanka ur acting is best ❤️
Nice ❤️
Mannnn... Priyanka has nailed it yar

Just imagine if kashi does the exact thing🙃

This child is of Priyanka or deepika actually I didn&#39;t watch the entire movie

I just loved &#39; Which heart, what kind of heart? &#39;
Priyanka easily overshadowed Ranveer and Deepika , she&#39;s the most talented Indian actress.

<a href="">15:34</a> Best depiction of choking throat due to pain and grief...the air couldn&#39;t pass through her throat freely....beautifully shown!!!! Wowwww

Epic dialogue by epic actress 👏👏
Mind-blowing acting of kashibai...just loved her

Love u priyanka...
lingerie
Priyanka you nailed it..!😍

mastaani and kaashibai are like sisters who have a complex story but always support each other without saying.

kaashibai was so good and acceptable and mastaani too endured all the pain for bajirao and broke the barriers of hindu muslim and set new customs. the only one who was at fault was bajirao. he isn&#39;t bad but he tried to be a good husband but you know love is only for one only.

Kashi bai is better than mastani

<a href="">12:30</a> wht a  acting

Priyanka you gave the justice to kashibai&#39;s character!! You were show-stopping!! Proud to be a PC fan

Big fan of priyanka chopra

When mastani was bowing down to kashi i hope she did not acecept that kashi would let her after what all she had done to kashi if kashi would have done what mastani did she would insult her a lot and kashi gave her a lot of respect

They said what about Marilyn Monroe to JFK.  Marilyn was part of Eve, JFK was part of the Adam, how do we judge them.  What about Lay O.  She was also part of Eve and children.  When people tried to marry a married man then turned around to judge a pair of husband and wife, it gets complicated.  Thank you.

Comment section praising PC but i think the main character of the story was mastani herself without her nothing was there to watch then usual kingdom shit... That was the actual reason this movie was made for the audience to know their epic love story. I don&#39;t think its anything wrong. I could relate my story to theirs as one of my ex was a half Muslim too...I can understand how he&#39;s family completely tried to disobey her and kill her also which hurts at d end of the day...If the hindu gods(sri krishna) above can have thousands of wifes then why can&#39;t bajirao have 2 instead... people here are praising Kashi more than Mastani... I think we should appreciate Mastani as well even she was Muslim she died in horror till her last breathe which is inhumane for maratha...

Finally, Alauddin, Ranveer or Bajiirao if any of them were the Adam or part of the Adams, they can only be married to Eve and her children and that had not changed since the get go.  If Mastani was married to Bajiirao you have to toss for tails and see where his female form known as Karng Rey was married to Mastani.  The answer was no she was not.  If he married other women besides Eve it just meant that he had resigned from being an Adam.  That is all.  No complications none whatsoever.   What of actor Keanu Reeves.  He said he is an Adam and is not planning to marry anyone besides Eve and childen, Eve as wife her children as his children.  Well said!  People commended him.  What of Ranveer.  Keanu said Ranveer had an option, Alauddin did not.  We did say that Keanu was half of Alauddin.  He nodded.  Ranveer said he no longer wanted to live because Mastani embarrassed him too much.  He asked when she was anyone&#39;s wife.  She said on stage or off stage.   As far as I know Ranveer did all this because he wanted to maintain his status with Eve and look how it turned out for him.   As an Adam he was engaged to Eve in Ram-Leela&#39;s night of pro-creation, said Ananda who was in charge of the program.  He had to double check constantly to verify it was Eve that he was married to.  To answer to Ranveer those ladies came with their own men as Bajiirao and Mastani.  Nothing wrong with that except it was an ID that was incorrect, &#39;married to a married man.&#39;  Thank you so much.🌹

A very special warrior, portrayed like Devdas 😬
priyanka chopra overshadow all the characters

Infidelity was,is and will always be wrong.

When locals experience second lead syndrome

I used to saw these clips for priyanka&#39;s acting. Mind blowing

Ranveer as Bajiirao finally said that he was just trying to help the US Ambassy and that no one treatened to burn his children.  Well said, all of it.  Thank you so much.🌹👼👩‍🦳😥😪😢💛💚🧡💜💙🎂

Israel asked if Mastani had to have a husband did it have to be somone else&#39; husband.  They already said with the start that Bajiirao killed their husband.  How much were they from the last scene?  None!  Israel added that we still need to know how much was Keanu Reeves with Bajiirao.  He said we don&#39;t have any scenes to co-joint with terrorist against the white ambassy especially if it was an American ambassy.  That would be the first wife, children and family.  That Bajiirao might be on his own.  Absolutely not.  He finally said he was not sure if he was with Bajiirao at all.  He came to Hawaii from Jayn-La, Ranveer went to India.  Hollywood said Bajiirao was an Indian program.  Indian said they did not know how they had program with prostitution.  They had been upset and they searched and did not find history like that and terrorist were not shy to accept credit that they composed much of that.  Israel asked them why.  And they said they got a kick out of  it as people were not able to tell heads or tails.  For what its worth his mother kept saying no to Mastani, actually, the whole court did to the very end.  Israel nodded.  Thank you.

I&#39;ve never watched a movie like this. All 3 of them acted so well that sometimes it&#39;s hard to believe that it is actually a movie. This movie deserved an Oscar.

What is that bindi call that Priyanka is wearing? What&#39;s the style? Is it really a bindi? And what it signifies?

Kashibai character and priyanka 💙

Priyanka 😍
Priyanka !! Just wow !!

That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like this movie they trying to justify bajirao and mastani what they did to Kashi Bai....

i would love to know and understand what are they saying...to bad no subs...

Priyanka Chopra acting is awesome

Asli love ho hota hai jinme sacrifice thae 😘😘

Someone said Mastani came to India to make trouble here and there but no one paid attention so she left went back to her country.  Ram of India said the same thing.  That people did not know where the current filming came from.  As far as King Jayavarman VII, his first wife died then he married Queen Indradevi.

China finally said these people were browsing around to see if they could start atomic war.  And they added if Joseph had a substitute that could replace him.  Joseph asked why?  Yes, these were the first couple to fake Bajiirao.

India added that they had already tried to sign to end unemployment benefits but we don&#39;t know how far it will go.  Joseph said he does not know if actress Deepika ever had his ID at all.  Joseph asked if Deepika was deeply depressed, how did she get his ID.  She said she had no idea what people do.  That Joseph had never done anything to her how did people come to steal his ID.  India said there seemed to be a long line waiting to play Mustani...to sign as Joseph but we don&#39;t know on what matter...all illegal citizens...for sure was to end unemployment benefits on the Americans in the US.  Are these people Americans.  They said not a one.  Israel said this actress probably should sit down as no one else had a chance to live yet.  People confirmed again, all illegal foreigners wanting to sign to end unemployment benefits for America.  They called themselves &#39;American God.&#39;  The leaders from both China and Thailand said they had not called themselves &#39;American God,&#39; how could these illegal citizens from both countries called themselves &#39;American God.&#39;  Good one!  They said they had burnt Joseph did that not give them the rights to rule in his post as &#39;American God.&#39;  They said no one was aware of anything like that.  They said they burnt him in 1975 - 1978 and thought that would give them the rights as &#39;American God!&#39;  Oh, my God!

Some of the danger zone here was that they wanted to fake the actress&#39; ID and started to sign in place of Joseph.  Joseph said he was not Mustani, he was just there to help the children.  India said Joseph was there to help but these people twisted and said Mustani was Joseph and they therefore could use her ID to sign things as they were also Mustani.  India added that the point is the actress Deepika is not Joseph.  Exactly!  Who said she was?

If the child created the world his mother would also have traits as creating the world also.  If the mother did not create the world then she is not his mother.  Same with Alexander The Great, the mother must be the same traits as Alexander The Great or they are not their mother.  Asked if the people trying to fake Bajiirao&#39;s ID were dangerous.  India said extremely dangerous enough to prompt India to put this number on air.  Thank you.

I like deepika than priyanka.but in this film priyanka deserves much recognition than deepika.Her acting is fabulous

Peshwas are just an ashiq not any warrior.

Bajirao loved both equally but did not know why he was trolling all the lovers.
As to the qustion if Bajiirao consumated with Mastani...there was evidence that he did not.  If the child belonged to Mastani...that was probably not the case.  Terrorist probably set up the program to challenge the God that was all.  In this case they challenged Bajiirao.  If Mastani was a horse and Bajiirao riding the horse did that make them a couple they asked.  The Queen said we don&#39;t think it that way.  India said they saw 2 couples that were not Bajiirao...that would be all.  The horse and their master would be a couple yes.  They could ride into the sunset.  You know they have sunset boulevard every where.  Thank you.

Priyanka is fabulous ❤️❤️
<a href="">14:36</a> stolling scene...

My fvrt chrctr is Kashi.. love for PC alwz

At <a href="">11:15</a> she is not priyanka

Here's the film, see where it has Indonesian subtitles... Give me some info
I watch the whole movie feel like it was all about kaahis pain priyanka nailed the character

The wife's sacrifice was not given any importance. This is wrong...the name of the movie should be Kashibai 🙏🙏🙏
Years ago.. Multiple marriage was common for kings only and was valid if there is any  political reason behind 2nd marriage... If any king does second marriage by his own will I think it&#39;s wrong and disloyalty towards his wife but if any valid political reason hai  to 1st wife ko accept Karna chahiye though it&#39;s very hard ..log example dete hai chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj ne ek se jyada shadiyan ki lekin samajte nai ki  swarajya ke liye unhe karni padi...by his own will nai ki....So there is difference ...we should see purpose behind everything..

Deepika eyes are just fabulous

Priyanka&#39;s act was just fab

Kochi  has english kids not streets for lust.

Alauddin&#39;s child did make an apprearance on ទំនួញនាងពិម្ពា ស្មូតដោយអ្នកនាង ណក់ ចំរើន/មានអក្សររត់.  They aksed if a man taking up an ordain as monk was not the same as leaving his wife to have an affair and what if they lumsum that affair to Mastani and brought that back to Alauddin.  Both Sakya and Joseph said no one understands that question.  They said to them men already failed to this lust.

Every person's home life is disturbed, he wants Bajirao, or Imran Khan.
What if he was trying to write peotry about his wife what if....   Except the child had already said, &quot;You can speak your mind but not on my time...&quot;  Simply means, &quot;...I have had like to die like a rose under the desert sky...&quot;  Billy Joel and Mon Amour Operatica.  Thank you very much.

Soneone asked if the man having affair with Mastani was Alauddin.  Keanu/Isannapura said no.  Who was he they asked.  He said we don&#39;t know but good question.  Bajiiroa did call the first child &quot; A lad&#39; for Allauddin using the English language.  He said that was his real child.  Possibly meant that his wife was a virgin coming to marry him.  He said there was no point of having another man&#39;s wife.  They added that if she she was his real wife she would try to understand his pain but no one else understands it.  Exactly!  Thank you

Asked if Shakespear was an Islamic child.  King Phillip said no.  Shakespear was a Master of the English language and the world shares that.  Asked if he didn&#39;t have an Islamic mother did he have Joseph as Mastani.  Was Joseph Mastani.  They said no but they were trying to make Joseph into Mastani.  Joseph said no he would not want an affair with a married man that it is incorrect and from that incorrect you have an English Master.  How does that work.  He said an English Master is not an error.  He said no he was not Mastani but he was there to save the child from Islamic rite the sacrifice of a child.  Alauddin&#39;s child brought through as Mastani&#39;s child we don&#39;t know if that was the case.  Joseph simply said no.  The ritual of abducting someone&#39;s else child then walk throught fire is not correct.  He said Shakespear speaks English that means he is a white child and not Mastani&#39;s child.  The Queen said that Islamic should find the master of Islamic language themself and not abducting someone else&#39;s child like the Master of the English language for example.  The Islam said they don&#39;t know what these people are doing why would they want an Islamic God throught Mastani as an affair to a married man.  Good one!.  The Queen said that is one piece that could not be sold.  Agreed!  Someone asked if Islam was trying to find Islamic master through the English and through India.  They responded that it was worth the shot because they were terrorist.  The Islamic Mastani&#39;s father said throughtout these whole scenes there were no Islamic involovement there was just her.  Joseph added that it was very upsetting that she should not be walking around like that.  Thank you so much.

Priyanka ❤️
Now In present days I face same situation Among  me and my wife and offcourse girl friend

Ufff I cry when I saw pc acting

PC is the best, And Kashibai was a strong women, l as a Maratha truly respect her!

For a long time I couldn&#39;t bear sight of this movie. I had a bad friendship breakup. I was left alone to fend for myself. Even looking at Kashi Bai gave me anxiety. I am happy that I am in a better space now.

Better u could killed Kashi Ranveer Bcz of Ur infatuation which u thought a true luv made Kashi to feel like a hell two big negative characters in the history bajiraomastani😠

super acting priyanka chopada
Peiyankas  acting  touches  the  heart very  talented  actress  mashaAllah  stay  blessed  🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Kashi  is  amazing  so  gracefully  she  handled  this relationship 👍👍👍

plz show the best scenes of manikarnika......

I really want justice for kashi... I dont give a fck about mastani.....

Ranveer and Deepika are very Talented and Beautiful Actor and Actress.......

So sad u cant make people to fall in love with u.☹.

Hates Deepika 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Feel the pain of a woman

According to Joseph during his era the second wife was by contract only...mainly to save the children from the last scene.  There was no consumation, but with Bajiiroa we don&#39;t know how it was dealt with.   &quot;Oh, My Mother I will Bear This Punishment So They Will Not Harm You...!&quot; was Alauddin&#39;s child.  Thank you so much.

Why does Deepika have just one expression with tears in her eyes in all the scenes

I feel irritated by the love of bajirao and mastani. A cheater ! He cheated on kashibai

Priyanka is not one of the finest actors, she is the ONLY FINE ACTRESS IN BOLLYWOOD

Similar evolution to king Jayavarman VII in Cambodia is Bajiiroa.  &#39;Komlos Sim2.&#39;  King Jayavarman VII had the surrogate mother First then he married his Queen Indradevi.  Bajiiroa had his Queen then another wife.  The dialogue was addressed extensively by his first wife.  The recount of possibly the same conception was done by both Cambodian and India.  The first here was of a child and mother, the latter was by the father and his extensive.  Both of these men were seen together as the King on the throne with his tiger to his left and Bajiiroa the general.  2 epic propotions...all the same we pray and hope that family came together because of love and not animosity.  But out of curiosity...was Bajiiroa taking on a new wife to try to save his child that was bore to the fire in what seem to be a 3rd party pregnancy in the last scene of Padmaavat...who was his boy then...and they finally released him with a birth if he took them on as the 2nd wife.  If so, we blessed him that his children were born.  Thank you so much. 💘💘

Anyone have full movie link????

Brilliant...

Prinka was superb in this movie

Second wife says he didn&#39;t leave you. Why did you make her (first wife) an option? You can&#39;t understand the pain.

Love the clothes of mastani

Nice

Priyanka Chopra Slayed That Role. 👍 You Can See That Grief That Pain In Her Eyes. 🥺

Ok whatever.... But it made me really angry when Bajirao and Mastani weren&#39;t even regretful towards Kashibai.... They were like “Yeah we&#39;re in love, so what?”wtf dude?? Atleast you should be apologetic..... I tried so hard to sympathize for mastani&#39;s character, but could not

Priyanka 😍😍
Super

Deepika 😍😍😍
What love did you do by fucking your wife? It can destroy even Bajirao. Be loyal.
Priyanka&#39;s CHARCHATER better and bigger than deepika

I think priyanka is better than dipeeka ❤love u Priyanka

Priyanka is such a talented actress. The way she shows sadness in one eye and concealed in the other👏🏻👏🏻

Ha amcha bhor cha rajwada ahy 🚩
Everyone is talking about Priyanka...But i think that they all did a great job💙

Kashi from <a href="">9:17</a>-<a href="">12:16</a> is the best

Priyanka Chopra looks fabulous in Indian traditional dresses 🔥❤️
Priyanka acting super
Deepika looks so dumb.
Deepika looks Divine and heavenly beautiful ❤️

Where can i find this whole movie..

Priyanka is the best
Hmm

We haveto see the movie to see settings, dialogues,actors music etc .But what is the storyA king got dieid for the sake of  wife not for the sake of protecting the kingdom for enemies.

Always. Awosme. Movie.

People commenting about kashi bai&#39;s pain.... Bajirao cheated her... But past can&#39;t be judged with present&#39;s lens...Kashi and Bajirao got married when they were kids.. they were more of friends... Polygamy and child marriage was a norm...So chill many emperors and kings had many wives...

The film&#39;s name shouldn&#39;t be bajirao mastani, instead of BAJIRAO MASTANI, it should be KASHI BAI❤️❤️ not a fan of priyanka still her acting make everyone her fan❤️❤️🥺

The way she says &#39;Guroor&#39; she makes you feel what she&#39;s feeling. There&#39;s simply no word to describe how amazing the dialogue delivery was. I&#39;m not a critique or something. Just another audience

True love Priyanka did ... thats called true love

No matter how much love was between baji and mastaani....it can never be called true love...

Best dialogue- What is your heart, what is your heart, what is your heart, what is your heart, what is your heart, what is your heart?
Fabulous film and an exceptional cast.👏

Toni asai and aneo mushrat ka bollywood
Peecee is the life n soul of the movie as kashibai then ranveer as bajirao slay

My most favourite  movi

Dipika ka expression too good ,both are amazing Dipika and priyanka

Can anyone explain me why I can understand 20 % what they say, because I speak classic Arabic and they seems to me they speak hindi mix with Arabic

Priyanka is so classy!!

Priyanka ❤️
Priyanka is awesome her acting skills are killing

PC your fab

Throughout the movie I felt bad for kashibai(priyanka).Bajirao mastani is so incorrect. What&#39;s to celebrate!

The only thing beautiful about this movie is the awesome costumes and set design. Everything else is mediocre or poor. Poor acting, pathetic dramatic dialogues and poor direction. Hindi movies are at the most a visual treat or otherwise a joke. There are so many things that are silly in this movie - people who are in such high places are hardly sentimental people. They are very aware of the importance of their position and realize they can&#39;t live normal,  romantic middle class lives.

I really felt bad for the way Kashi found out he cheated on her. Basically didn&#39;t deserve  Kashi. I would have never accepted any gift from mastani if I was Kashi. I would have thrown it back at her.

What if priyanka played mastani and deepika played kashi... would  we still be praising priyanka more?As for me, I think so. I think priyanka would have played mastani to perfection. And still v ll be sympathizing with her. Its the acting. Ranveer n priyanka r better actors. Deepi did work hard. Poor deepi she had ranveer n priyanka who stole it all from her.

Priyanka killed it 😍

<a href="">3:20</a> i dont know why this sounds like hunger games to me =/

Deepika is awesome

You might like priyanka in this movie but deepika as mastani giving completely royal &amp; real vibes !

What Bajirao and Mastani did was disgusting and all the love and power goes to Kashibai who truly devoted herself

Priyanka is fabulous actress❤️

One of my favorite movie . every dialogue is mind blowing.

It was very wrong that man or king can marry any womens they want but women are not allowed

Enjoyable movie. I&#39;m all for polyamory, but Kashi wasn&#39;t okay with this. So, it&#39;s a no for me.

Priyanka Chopra has nailed it 👍👍

Ufff deepika as mastani ki acting ka jawab nahe. Her acting is in the sky and gives feelings of how a real mastani might be. Qatilana acting. Mastani ki ada madhoshi wali hai.

Bakwas

If a woman marry another man &amp; came infront of her husband ,, what he will  do ??!!🙄🙄🤔🤔🤔

The warrior has thrown the tab on the mountain, he has shown the sword in his hand.
Priyanka ❤
I luv PC ❤
master piece

Mastani character is historical ❣

Priyanka&#39;s acting......awesome
