Thats just oil... oh noFBI OPEN UP!

PARACHUTE FROM FORTNITE

I think it is a blue whale or just maybe it’s photoshopped

School of fish stupid

Its a portal to another dimension.

Or seaweed

Looks like a blanket to me

A giant harlem trout , It left because it didn&#39;t  like all the piss in the water  from all those people...

Could be a sting ray.....probably is a sting ray....notice how it swam away when the people started touching it? A school of fish wouldn&#39;t have swam that close to the shore ...let alone to humans...a sting ray might have...and there was a second smaller,but still large one off to the right. My guess is the guy filming was just lazy.

Send it to billschannel

Dont worry. Its just a bird&#39;s shade falling on water.

It's the shadow of a cloud, deluded idiots.
Its just bluefish! Bluefish! Chief, its a school of bluefish!

what the hell is that🤤

it kinda looks like a giant stingray

Its just a big blue bedsheet sissys

Can u go under water so we can see the shape

It&#39;s posiedons used condom

Someone left their big momma&#39;s panties drifting in the sea.

Maybe its a ship drowned

that&#39;s was a group of small fish

it&#39;s some kind of intergalactic space robo-marital aid from alpha centari, sent to give ancient aliens another season of bull shit...

It&#39;s most likely a big school of fish. They swarm together to make themselves seem like a single big fish and deter predators. Like the fish in Finding Nemo that formed into various shapes, or like  Wishiwashi and it&#39;s Schooling ability from Pokemon Sun and Moon.It could also be a large clump of seaweed being brought in my the tide, but I doubt that would gain so much interest.

It appears to be a manta ray

its a small fish

No I think the people are pulling a net.

Something that can be seen from far ...........................

probably from the blue sea

Sting ray 😦
this is what
For those of you saying it&#39;s a giant sting ray. It&#39;s called a manta ray and they don&#39;t sting.  Harmless and  very beautiful peaceful creatures look up manta rays. or its a school of small fish

Well, I guess if it was something scary or harmful, the people would have ran out of the water? I wish the camera person would have gotten closer!!! Might have been a large school of fish.

fkee

My guess is a baitball. many thousands of small fish,  schooling, to avoid predatory animals

hmm what is that

ITS A Shadow or something

lol

It&#39;s a school of fish

probably a pyrosome or siphonophore...

probably a pyrosome or siphonophore...

NICE!

bilion litle fish

Thank you, cameraperson, for your sheer determination on refusing to move your lazy ass closer. Really, it&#39;s just wonderful &gt;.&gt;

cant be too scary since people are petting it

it&#39;s a school of fish

They are school of small fish that is why the shape of blue color change.

people wouldn&#39;t be standing near a giant sting ray, idont think I would want to be near one bc of its tail

but their is people in the water

Manta rays are the largest rays and are known to be very docile. They can reach 7 meters (23 ft). That&#39;s the first thought that I had, especially because it&#39;s slower moving and doesn&#39;t seem to mind all the people around it.

oil

sting ray or oil from a boat

inflated hot air balloon

Maby it&#39;s a sea weed bed

That&#39;s a school of fish

its a kite shadow

fake ! people don&#39;t seem to be scared at all or reacting to a &quot;mysterious creature&quot;...

It could be a school of small fish or a big deflated float or blanket

looks like the sting Ray that killed Steve Irwin

wtf is that

wow.i want to see that on real life.

dramatic blue blanket

It&#39;s a school of fish

video montage

Anyone watching in 2015?

it was deeznutz

no one speaks spanish here hahahaha
school of fish

It might be a large sun fish

well that sea creature didn&#39;t kill anyone who went near it

Probably just a school of fish

what are those

it&#39;s a sting ray

I thought it was a big octopus

So what is it?

who ever think,that it&#39;s a sea monster is stupid because it&#39;s just a sarden

That&#39;s isn&#39;t a creature it&#39;s water spilled from the the back , that&#39;s how oceans water look like when they are in the same place

haha its like .......... a giant water animal

OMG NO MY BLAKIT!!!!

nah these are just some bigass pants that felt from someones bigass

Nobody ever seen a school of fish before?

It&#39;s an ore fish

hpouytrewascubk lm

It looks like a massive sting ray or manta ray

it&#39;s a shadow from a cloud

It may be a sting ray

Guys they no mosnter is Just a lit le fishe ^-^😧

School of fish

I speak Spanish
That&#39;s just a huge Ray...

Baby Ruth.. If you get this joke then bravo!

It looks like a school of small sardines or small type of fish swimming in a group.

WHAT WAS THAT MAN?! IS THAT A SHARK OR STINGRAY OR SOMETHING?!?!?!!?!?!😦😦😦😦
I think it&#39;s a sting ray

its a Pussy fish

You&#39;re all crazy. Does no one seem to think it is a cloud shadow? They can be in any shape. They move, they dissipate and they change. If it were sardine and someone dives at them, they would scatter; if it were a stingray many would keep clear, plus stingrays do not swim near humans; if it were a cloud of plankton they would separate if someone dived there. My instant feeling was a cloud shadow.

it&#39;s just a big ray-fish

it&#39;s GODZILLA   RUN

idk what is that creature but I don&#39;t believe it, so I don&#39;t want to watch it agajn

When stingrays were founded

It&#39;s a school of fish for fuck sake.

This is chupacabra!

dorry guys it was my mistake ,i shouldn&#39;t masturbate under the water

The lack of panic from those in the water leads me to believe this is fake

ohh i was there and .. it was not a sea creature ...!! duh .. and if it was a sea creature then we all would have freaked out !!!! ohhhhhh

What is that kind of sea creature?

So the only fucking person with a camera decided to stand 100 yards away WHILE others were rushing the shape and practically on top of it? Get real. The camera person wouldn&#39;t be that far away. It&#39;s a school of fish or a long cloth. Similar to the ones used on long dinner tables. I&#39;m not buying this BS of how EVERY time a ghost or creature or UFO is &quot;caught&quot; on tape it is always too blurry, too far, too high, too dark, get real!

Kyogre appeared

Steam of fish

I don&#39;t see everything i see

it looks like a sting ray to me...

Oh I&#39;m so scared. like all those people in the video 😱

pretty sure thats a manta ray fish

It&#39;s just a school of fish or a manta/sting ray. No big deal.

its probably a school of fish

remember when scientists said they might be able to make new discoverys before the year 2029, this may be one of them

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a school of fishes, maybe a manta ray of sting ray, no screaming or running so its either that it&#39;s nothing to worry about r it IS something to worry about and I those ppl are so dum or badass that they don&#39;t get out of the water. Anyways it isn&#39;t a school of fish cos some fish will fall behind,there aren&#39;t any stragglers in this vid,so ray or jelly fish

What is going on I don&#39;t get it at all😪



Whats just a giant Ray amk 

Wow. It&#39;s a floating monster pulled on a rope. Better Summon Godzila.

HEY SHUT UP! I KNOW IM BIG, BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO CALL ME A SEA MONSTER!

Oh yeah I would remain that calm  if I saw a new ocean creature that I&#39;ve never seen before in my life...

School of fish...

What the fuck !!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so fake. 

it&#39;s funny how the masses seem to embrace this sea creature instead of running from him?

WOW

This is like a manatee or something because these ppl wouldn&#39;t jump into the water and look at it,they would get OUT.this is a friendly animal 

Who knows how to speak Spanish, because all the comments are in English hahaha😂💙

Some people seemed to touch it....like you know...passing their hand on it.... But it isnt very clear though 

nice

hiii

I think it&#39;s a big sting ray ?

skool of fishes

A lot of times schools of fish will rush toward the shore to get away from something.  They&#39;ll run right into the people lol.  I grew up on the gulf coast. This type of thing is common.  And the no screaming and running kinda lets you know it&#39;s innocuous.  

Just a 25 foot long eel
Its kyogre

Pokemon are real?????Yay no its a squid

Its a wave! 

Looks like a fishing net to me. Maybe something is caught in it?

Why r u guys still in the water what if it was going to kill u

It&#39;s a school of small fish.

It could&#39;ve been a huge black blanket, no?

Everybody gets closer to the, what ever it is, yet the filmer stays on the same spot all the while and expects us to believe it&#39;s something strange. 😕

I&#39;d call this a sea carpet

Its probably just a manta ray, the biggest ones can have a wing span like single prop plan.

Looks like a giant ray....

Maybe it is the shadow of the cloud?

Ray or school its a really fake piece of crap

School of fish. Lol, the dude who dived in to it?

It must be some kind of shoal of something....-.-
shoal of small fish

Nobody is afraid of it?!! And it changes shape. So must be school of fish. People run toward it not away!!

oil I think this is

why so many people go to swim over it?

They don&#39;t have to be dark fish

It&#39;s a sting ray

It&#39;s a thick school of fish! Sardines.or z krill.

I&#39;ve seen this in fresh water.  A school of several hundred newly hatched catfish in a school.  Scared us to death when we first saw it.  Nothing strange, just mother nature doing her deal.

yeah probably fish although it could be a load of seaweed

Of course its a school of fish, but with 13 million views its good advertising for the lottery.

It&#39;s probley a school of fish

It&#39;s a LION!!!!ROAR &gt;=)

Me Too I Love Mermaids I Wanna Buy A Shirt At Target That Says &quot;Mermaid At Heart&quot;

Wtf , that&#39;s only the clouds. --

Whatever it was, it seemed friendly. I think it was actually letting people go up and pet it :3

Or maybe just a school of fish.....?

ITS THE LOCKNESS MONSTER!!!!!!!!

probably seaweed or a shadow from abouv

a shadow of a big kite or a parachute

noob

screw the sea creature, what about all the hot chicks running on the beach!

it is Chuck Norris

Somebody have accident, that all.

It could also just be an over sized stingray. Stingray have been known to swim around people. You just have to be carfull when your doing it. And these people are being carfull

Wow! How amazing!

Wow 

i think its just some little fishes that  swim close together  

This is fake it&#39;s just a big school of fish notice how nobody tries to get out of the water lol

It could of been a  shadow of  a kite 

Not a stingray... not a single creature... It&#39;s a school of fish.You see it change shape half way through.

Its a school of fish ....

What 

A beach blanket or a manta ray

School Fishes!

perhaps plakton schools or fry
Wat is it

Looks like a dead whale or something!

schools of fish

school of fish.

it&#39;s a fucking manatee 

it was a big ray

its a black sand or just a small hole

No fear in the folks observing....no one screamed, no one yelled, no one headed back to shore.....just a school of fishies..........

Its a stingray guys. Or an eagle ray... Just chill

Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak

That thing just wants a friend maby

they are new born catfish. . andami. . .

What the hell is that thing

Fish! notice people all go over to it and no one runs out of the water.

Maybe an oil leak haha.  I remember one of the movies i watch oil leak ate people

What was that??? Oh my god :O
JUST KEEP SWIMMING&#39;

lord father its a school of fish

Cool

It&#39;s a school of fish it doesn&#39;t take a brain to tell u that

That was a clump of seaweed at the bottom of a shallow ocean with clear water.

Which one male or female bro???

People aren&#39;t running scared from it because they know it&#39;s just a school of sardines, which are very common in that part of the world.

????????????????????

It&#39;s just a school of fish

it is call fish if you never heard of it 



cat fish
its a sting/manta ray ._.

Its just seaweed.

millions of little fish
I don&#39;t think its digitally manipulated because people seem to be running towards it to see what it is. And the people near it aren&#39;t moving away from it because they are close enough to see that its not scary, like a school of fish most likely...

it&#39;s a shoal of fish that losing the navigated

the big coneris my guys are bluefe
???

Nobody see it from under the water

WOW,  BEAUTIFUL!! GREAT VIDEO! AWESOME .... Thank for sharing!﻿
I was in that sight it was a Godzilla !O.o!

cgi 

You are unfairly tyrannizing to get a tip. The stall was closed and here is the result.
I cant be a school of fish

What is it

It can&#39;t be a kite

I think its an alien from pluto

I&#39;m inclined to think it was a large Manta ray. The like contact with people. Most of the time , not always. And before anyone mentions the sadly missed Steve Urwin, that was accidental. The ray didn&#39;t attack him.

No way it&#39;s  Godzilla
If it was a real strange creature the guy with the camera would have gotten closer to show a better look .

And the fuckin human race won again!!

like to see the man try to jump into the shadow hihi

Its a pool of godzilla urine



HEY EVERYONE LETS ALL SWIM TOWARDS THIS LARGE BLACK SHAPE IN THE WATER

oil stain or tarpaulin! not an animal! ;)
What is it

It&#39;s a shoal of fish. Amazed those people stayed in the water as there are great whites in the Med.....

was that an oar fish or just sardines? if so, then i want some of them sardines.

Ribbon worm
Schools of fish, nothing more, nothing less.

It is nothing a fake more then likely ...Come on the people would be freaking out

school of fish

it was actually a group of sardines. they swim in massive groups. they are not harmful at all. they do not like being touched so they clear way for objects but they eventually completely surround the object without even touching them no matter which direction the person moves

Guys I think it&#39;s a very large manta ray coming in to shore in search of food, and happened to do so at that beach. Although it is just a blob not a ray shape. Really, I could believe  either answer.

fish band

That is bunch of fish

NO MORE THAN A BABY SPERM WHALE...

school of fishes.

C&#39;mon guys it&#39;s a kraken calm down

Either just seaweed or a school of fish, we&#39;re not stupid

Every one stays in the water close to it so it was nothing.

Probably just a bunch of fish. No splashing on the surface even though It was super shallow. And all the people near by weren&#39;t shitting brick and hauling ass outta the water

Or monster
A big ass sea worm

You all should have ran

Could be a school of small fish, it looks similar to a flock of birds.

Im sure this is some cloth left  by someone and all this is fake...

the creature want to sex

kayata

See Weed fish smoke it

O_o

Its gazillion of small shrimps:)

It&#39;s a school of fish.

?

School of fish

Mullets school,...

I&#39;ve seen this before just schools of fish and no it&#39;s not strange very common in shallow water.

Willy's grandfather is here, he's on vacation... because there's nothing like Halkidiki
Shoal of bait fish.

in the end what was that? a school of fish logically so as not to scare the others who were sitting next to
pure blowjobs, that vibe is not a monster...
telika th ston poutso htan ?

giant stingrays..... that means.... o.o giant steve irwin?

eye candy

All of these videos that have black moving splodges are huge schools of fish ! 

school of fishes

What a monster and green horses, that's stupidity, they're whipping her, they're fish that came out, but you're fed up with the tiki taka in here. Where to get to Greece...Armenist and the brains on the horn and on the bar!! !
Been on that place and seen a couple of those my self.. just schools of fishes.. but to be honest, I was running here and there like crazy thinging it was a giant stingray until I understood what it was..!!

It's an oil spill
that was a group of fishes @@

<a href="">0:46</a> sea monster or not, but kids like to playing with this thing! :S

oh me gerd.... its a GIANT STING RAY :O it just came to say HI to the ppl :D 

piranha?
Not sure what it is but it seemed to move like a worm at one point

Yamame?
giant stingray?

is a fish, ia bird, is a swiming roket, NO IS A PIXEL PROBLEM :)))

My wife, who has never left Maine in her life and never even seen tropical water guessed &quot;small school of fish on her second guess. Come on people. Lol

Hasn&#39;t anyone seen a large school of really small fish? This is why the swimmers didn&#39;t freak out guys. I have seen this up close and personal. That&#39;s just a bunch of really little fish. Nothing scary. :)

its a school of fish. is all. 

It&#39;s a parachute Dumass

It&#39;s clearly a shoal of bait fish. The shoal above is being attacked by predators, you can see the splashes of evading prey. Bait fish will hug the shore as a defensive posture, similar to armies using the landscape to avoid being outflanked.

Its just a stingray!

shoal of fish.... you guys need to got out more often....

its a bunch of fish

Probably a type of ray...or aa grouping of small fish?

maybe a big stingray?

Run away - it&#39;s a hnakra!!!
it looks like a giant stingray by the way its moving

If it had been really interesting surely the person with the camera would have walked over to it rather than standing still. 

And no one even cares to try looking under water at it really

Those people aren&#39;t scared so it&#39;s someone in a costume

What is that kind of  that sea creature

Oarfish.

It was a school of fish. Look at how it changes shape

Its sharkpedo...pokemon

geeez it&#39;s just a school of bait fish.

School of fish

MA E SOLO UNO SCIAME  DI SARDINE!!!!!

With a manta ray that size, I&#39;m pretty sure no one of those people would have gone that close!!

I saw 3 during that vid. There was one near the rocks...

Manta ray don&#39;t you think 

Its Lagaricus.

ok..............

a bane of fish certainly
I think its a kite from above

&quot;Brody it&#39;s just blue fish!!&quot;

Whut is that

Its fish -_-

Looks like a giant stingray

A tarp. Definitely not a group of fish because it would move in different directions

Armenist and the brains in the horn!
That minnow school said to itself. Great! Swimmers, we&#39;re bound to get a few scraps :-) 

DOES ANYONE THINK WE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE IN THIS FUCKING BULL SHIT?!?! 1. WHY ARE PEOPLE GOING SO CLOSE TO IT?! 2.WHY IS IT MOVING WITH THE WAVES?! 3. WHY IS IT FADING IN THE WATER AND GETTING DARKER LIKE ITS SOME LIQUID?!?!?!?!

its a jet bomb... you know...... a big ol chunk of poopy!

Group of fishes!! It is true cause that it the pictures of, I study fishes and the ocean!!

school of bluefish, just like on jaws2

Why did you not go near ?!!!!

stingray maby

Sea weed and school. Of fish

somebody threw their carpet into the sea

not you who made the video I mean dario and kandace tho and paulo garau

why you gotta call people dumb
maybe that was just a whale like an orca or something but not a sea monster or anything mythical like that

this thing sucks
A seabass is attacking people at the beach!

And it&#39;s a seabass!

It&#39;s an oarfish! Didnt u see the way they picked it up!? It&#39;s a fish that is long that is thought to be a dragon! I could say &quot;Help! Thers a strange seamonster attacking people at the beach!

They are fish, I was there, just fish
The bathers don&#39;t seem worried. They would be in a panic had it really been a.strange creature. 

it is a manta ray

school of fish

jesus that&#39;s a big lilo

It&#39;s a shadow from something in the air.

I can&#39;t believe a bait ball got over 12 million hits. You think word might get around.

Group of some fish

HEY GUYS! BYE GUYS!

Its just a long piece of clothIdiots these days. (:l)

do to the small freckles on the &quot;sea creature&quot; it is just a confused school of fish

I believe this is &quot;Sulur Bidar&quot;. It&#39;s a mystic creature lives in water. Old folks says that Sulur Bidar is like a carpet in the water. Fishermen often sees them whether in the sea or river or mines

shadow of an airbloon

Giant piece of cloth

tarp fish
Giant piece of seaweed?

Probably that is only people shitHahaha eat that shit..people =shit hahaha

thats alot of fish

Creepy what is it?

<a href="">0:15</a> that person on the raft floating air boat white red... whatever its called.... ok so yeah that person looks very scared of that whatever near by next to  it.... im trying to figure out my words

if that was like a sea creature then if it got to the shallow then it would surface

A school of fish trying to get away from other big fish, wish i was there to have seen them :-)

my money&#39;s on drunked russian tourist

tar or oil spot

Thats a group of little fishes

Group of little fishes

Ir a a blanket
Chuck Norris &#39;s hairy muff

there was two of those things

Just a manta Ray bro

Anyone ever hear of a bait ball?! Lol really tho it&#39;s a fucking ball of baitfish

the real answer is its a school of small fish idc if u do not believe this answer im telling u 100% truth.

I&#39;m guessing the guy videoing it was wheelchair bound then...........?

WOW!!!

It&#39;s called a school of fish

could&#39;ve been a school of fish 

the black thing is moving with the wind (i.e., an onshore breeze), is very long, not thick, and rises and falls in the water like a black plastic sheet - people find it non-threatening - just some flotsam or jetsam from a fishing vessel, possibly

A school of fish

Probably a floating whale carcus

ti htan telika?
its the very rare caribbean carpet

INTERESTING VIDEO................................11,963,039 VIEWS,    YEAH !!!
Yes hats it quite people run towards it. Smh

seaweed, a net

These are all over the beaches everywhere. It&#39;s a school of fish. It is creepy looking though

Its not one animal.  That&#39;s a typical movement of a school of bait fish. Look how it moves, changes shape etc...   Im more surprised about how close it came to people.  Rays etc don&#39;t change shape like that, and plastic sheeting doesn&#39;t suddenly move the other direction in the current, so no, its not one big fish/ray/shark or etc, its a whole lot of small ones.

Its just a school of fish lol

that is definetely not a creature... people wouldn&#39;t have gotten so close so carelessly if t were

This is drunked russian tourist

<a href="">1:11</a>

its a school of fish thats why it reacts to the waves and if it was as big as that folks would be running away not walking towards it

its either a sea eel which can get to around that size or a plastic tarp from a boat

im pretty sure if something that big was in the water people would be getting out instead of jumping in....i call bullshit 

The Blob.. or the Creature from the Black Lagoon..

I was so sacred I most pee my pants 

I think it was a big ass stingray

Okay either that&#39;s some type of fish or some type of giant piece of plastic in the water.. The only reason why i say that is because one it looks like it&#39;s moving with the waves of the water or two it&#39;s underneath water and the waves make it look like it&#39;s moving with the waves. 

dumbs thats a manta ray

It s à lot of smallest fish cock suckers!!!
???????? well who ever filmed it,must of spoke to people after and they were stood right near it..so disapointed there&#39;s no more info on it,,or its not this persons video footage

is that kaiju blue ??

They (people) should have gathered side by side behind and beside it .. therefore .. forcing it more on shore for a clearer look. Yes ! it was a school of small fish or anchovies ?

I don&#39;t think sea weed move close to u

So wat the fuck was it

They were all Humans.Predominately land based creatures they can use jointed limbs to swim or paddle 

Lol I love how everyone runs to it like the thing will be freindly and give presents :3

school of fish

I think it&#39;s a video of someone drowning.. But then whoever made the video edited a dark shadow imagine into it. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s what it looks like to me. 

could be a dead whale

Sea weed
could be a cluster of small fish <a href="">

arraia !

Omg! That is a huge marmaid

probably a clump of sea weed

the largest stingray to live

yeah a 30ft sting ray.



Could be a shadow

hey look strange sea creature thats been never found lets go in the water and find out REALLY 





just a blue sheet need pumping up lol

i wish they shot it

 nearer

is it a fish? it is something else? NO ITS A SCHOOL OF FISH!

Thousands of small fish must have been separated by the rest and found themselves here I guess. Or it could be a sea creature we have never seen before. Sounds more logical to me...

What really is stange is the lack of reaction of people = shit of bull vid.

Someone must of had taco bell.

sting rays can&#39;t get that big..

it&#39;s my grandma

nobody frightened? Strange...

Oarfish

school of fish or a manta ray... see i know these things because im from STRAYA YEAHHHHH

I was watching grumpy cat and this video showed up

GREEEEECE FOREEEEEEEEEVEEER

its a giant turtle

I wonder why he didn&#39;t move closer to get a better view while everyone seemed to be running excitedly to see....

Is it me or why is all of the other people just swimming in the water watching what this so called creature and dunk their heads down in the water and try to get a closer look? I&#39;m just saying!!!

maybe its a huge pile of oil and other chemicals mixed in to make it clump together like that or it might even be a giant stingray

I was there and no one thought it was a school of fish.

Its Rays not fish, fish jump even when the water moves by someone, they come right upto people

ssssoooo what is it?



It&#39;s a deflated rubber boat, or something similar, like a piece of plastic tarp.



that is a oar fish



School of sardines! See it all the time fishing!

@Matthew Belviy

I AM from Asia, but never seen such stuff like this... Only UFO&#39;s that I have seen with my naked eyes. I havent ever told anyone about what I saw those horrible nights... Including appartions aand Ghosts and stuff, but never &#39;Sea dragon like stuff&#39;.

its obviously not scary or deadly or people would be screaming and jumping out of the water

it looks like a simple school of fish 



i seened this many times, its not in the water its under the ground
