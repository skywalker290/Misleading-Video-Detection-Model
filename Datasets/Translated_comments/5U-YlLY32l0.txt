Aishwarya likes to indulge the media. But because the wedding was a man, he probably saw that the media was asking for too much. It would be more appropriate to let the wife take the next photo. Aishwarya should also understand her husband.
HI ABSHAIEEK IS  A SELFISH MAN AS HIS MOTHER IS A WICKED WOMAN BITCH

She is strong women    Jaya and daughter problem   here  jealousy and selfish mind

No manners at all😢

Vickat beatifull soul mates roke models to society shamelesly hapy coupkes divine souls in laws nise noramal kat godes by natyre no ill talj drugbeer ya chipija usliya gid gives amazing husbend normal nuse in lawz nuse na 😅❤😊

Abhk try to b a gud husbnd/dad..........not just brothr and son.....

He is toxic personTumse jalta hai Aishwarya.

Fake people

When I was with Salman Khan, I felt happy.
she gt her own back..now she ignoring  him.. she always  with  her  daughter.. dnt  blame  her..

Brother didi he is staying here
Devil munderu
It&#39;s name is KARMA

Kamsekam Abhishek is like his mother and father...My brother is a slave of his wife, he has forgotten his parents and lives separately after marriage...I wish my brother would be like Abhishek...who is the son of his mother and father. What will be the use of God if you don't know him?
This is all conjecture- in the first clip, Abhisehk and she may have different appointments to go separately. In the second clip the press guys are shouting solo, solo- they want a picture of Aishwarya alone, obviously, that’s why Abhishek moves away.  In fact Aishwarya is making a big deal of it, asking Abhishek to join her … Why are people so anxious to run this couple down? There is some truth to Shwweta Bachan running her down no doubt, and even her MIL doesn&#39;t seem too warm towards her, but Abhishek and Aishwarya seem to love and respect each other a lot.

A so narcissist man
And  this vedio  have bad editing.....ash waiting  for  someone  .....abishak  didn&#39;t  left and go......vedio shows  2 car.....when abishak  sitting  , it&#39;s different  and when ash waiting  ,it&#39;s shows  different  car....negative  people 🙄

Media please  don&#39;t  make stories......because  they use different  car.....diffnalty  they both  have  to go different  places. Abishak  also so good  👍

That's why the divorce bell was rung, both of them opened the door in the morning and sold their love.
Apne apko koi Prince smjne lg jate hen

Jb langoor ko hoor mil jae to asa hi hota he

Wow, why are you doing all this now? .Abhishek has been questioned. That emotional drama has been created. Advertisement has been made
Really all women&#39;s  having one r another  problems  .

Ash is a much much bigger ⭐ than Abhishek... Junior Bachchan has been a looser all his life while his wife has been super successful so Abhisek is simply jealous of his wife&#39;s success...

Amitabh was new in the industry and got fame because of Jaya but he had talent and was a great actor.  I still love watching his movies. He has an incredible voice and his acting skills are commendable.  Abhishek has big shoes to fill and however hard he tries, he cannot be even 10% as his dad. He has to first learn to treat his wife with respect and most of all in public.    Ash, you are better off without him.  Don&#39;t let him treat you like this.

It&#39;s ur duty to care and love her, need to be with her, respect her as she is equally a mother to ur daughter

Abishek  u r nothing infront of Aishwarya, still she respects you and your family maintaining all the rules and conditions of ur family on her....

Abhimaan 2 going on with  Abhishek !! 😡😡

Ash be like solo to me chahti tee

Both are good human

Personal problem nothing else so shut ur mouth ...idiots

When all this was done then marriage was not done.
Abhishek is a very egoistic and inferiority complex person.If he can&#39;t handle her that&#39;s his problem but why embarrass her.He is never happy

Langoor's hand in orange.... Money talks
Whaaaat??? This behaviour from Abhishek. Don’t be jealous because Ash covers more weight than you. You should be PROUD you married a BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS.

He&#39;s like his mother may be, always irritating.. pata nhi ghamand kis baat ka hai.  Nahi acha actor hai aur nahi good looking. He&#39;s lucky as a husband of Aishwarya Rai.

Hurry up..the widow in the room is open, she is staying all day, neighbor Chulbuli is there.
Obviously he walks away sulking bcz his wife gets more attention and is more successful then him..where ever she goes or who ever she meets they are in awe of her beauty and charm so soak it up buttercup and treat her like the queen she is!

Always my brother did the same. He left me alone. Useless fellow

Successful wife father but khud kuch zyada n karpaye ho to thodi boht jealousy to ho jati h ...

Ghanta

instead of being proud for his wife he is jealous with his wife.  before  getting into  relationship or married  he should have  think the person with whom he is going to spend  his lifetime  is world wide  famous .

celebrities life is not happy

These people are extremist.He doesn&#39;t know how to give respect to a lady like Ash

This society did not tell me why Aish married Abhishek.Husband is mother's boy...
She is really matured.... Insult engga handle chayyanu nannayi ariyam 🥰

True poncho Aishu...may never be born nowBs..this matter may Aishwaria not be the treasure of destiny
That is so bad of him to leave her behind ... I feel very bad for her

The media has shown every problem in hindsight.
He's an asshole...why did he marry her then? Aishwarya is the coolest woman in the world..🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️
Grapes came out of Langoor's hand…look, tears also came out.

These mafia guys will divorce and live without it.
It didn't take much to make even a little news.
so i personally think that if she was not happy with abhishek,, she already get separeted,,  she is not one of those women who stayes in a toxic relations,, just bcoz of some stupid reason,,she is indipendant,, she don&#39;t need a man to make her happy ,, she is successful,, she is rich,, she is one of the most beautifull women in the world,, so dont waste ur time  on creating these kind of fake news,, and its totally normal to have ups and down,, its common in e every  relationship,,

No matter How strong you are,the media affects you in SoME way...it can ruin your career ,your relationship or the opposite ...so please don&#39;t create ruckus between the couple...stop spreading rumors..

Animal also know how to loveHe is so arrogant.He his not Amitabh Bachchan son.sorry

guys chill.... Abishek is just giving her space since shes a star and people would like pictures of her alone... i think he was being respectful

One day she will open up and tell the world she was in q abusive marriage and never shared a bed in years

Media&#39;s r overreacting

bewaquf admi hy abishak..is tarha aishwarai ko akela nhi cholna chaheyea..very said 😔

Such a failure...... What can we expect from a spoiled kid of a rich father....

Tanya asks is that Jude in the back

I’m 2
Abhishak's looks like his mother are from Andar and there is some other thing as well.
Media insults Avery where and public.abhi,aishu was good.

First video toh pura fake tha... Gaya car mei... Video mei bataya SUV ...
Bhai Thumbnail Me Spelling to sai kr leta😂😂😂 DEKH RHI HAI KON DEKH RHI HAI

I think that ash choose a wrong guy for her man.....She always protect her relationship.....

No he was saying her to do solo as he knows media wants her single pics. It was so sweet of him actually!

Lol means kuch bhi
Very funny but I behave also behave like him wn i am angry😂

14 years already together....I think they will grow tired of each other just move forward like robot.....sad life....SOME people live that way.....

Indono k misunderstanding k reason jaya n shweta bacchan h
Irresponsible husband. And i wish some one slap him

Media asked for more pics of ash so he gave her , her space.

Abhishek’s got class. He knows the media want more of Ash and therefore he doesn’t spend too much time where he is not needed/wanted. He’s not insecure because of Ash, he just understands his market value and doesn’t feel the need to hog the limelight just because he is Ash’s husband. Also, no self-respecting man would want to be seen as his wife’s prop or an accessory. And you’ve got to give credit to Ash too for never ignoring or snubbing Abhishek in front of the world as she is more successful. You can clearly see that Abhishek is at the top of her priority list. Aishwarya is what you call beauty with brains. Hope this couple stays together and stays blessed.

This video is so misleading, they weren’t even fighting, they wanted single pics so abhisek told her to do it

Both are seems not to be happy with eachother

Don&#39;t try to spoil their marital life I like this couple

listen the conversation after <a href="">2:05</a>

Kiss chutiye se shaddi karle 🤣🤣🤣
Abhishek is not good for ashoria

One of the most pretentious family in industry.

Omg ash will also face same problem like jaya aunty, because of that sly, disgraceful, flirt amitabh bacchan. Keep crying ash.

Husband successful ho to wife proud feel karti hai but wife jyada successful ho to husband ko hajam kyun nahi hota.....male dominating mindset ....need women only for support that&#39;s y maximum restrictions imposed on women by society not by culture.....shame on this type of mindset

This is not the first time Abishek has walked out on Ash. There&#39;s a huge difference between giving a woman her spotlight and embarrassing her like that

I honestly been feeling this for a very long time that Abishek feels insecure of Ash&#39;s fame. She is so much loved by all while he&#39;s been living under his father&#39;s shadow.and I think that hurts his male ego. what a scum bag🙄🙄

He seems to be rude to her .

He doesn&#39;t ignore her. He live to care her

In every marriage, there is up and down, no perfect relationship. So media, stay out, of their marriage life.

Guys why u take everything in wrong its not like that

O.m.g. what a drama . He should be happy his wife is beautiful and famous .

miss world h wo hello

It&#39;s is hard for abhishek cuz most of the limelight is taken by his famous father or beautiful wife! The guy said it correcy it puts his confidence down when she is asked to take solo!

She should marry salman instead of him

He married her only name and fame

She gave him her beauty and younger like every women who don t got chance with men 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️

Attitude mother&#39;s attitude son ...

I just came here to comment RIP EDITING of thumbnail 🤣🤣

Worst media..

If you can&#39;t handle  things that come with a princess,  you should not marry.. everything comes at a cost..

no one cried even a little
Does he feel like he has to compete with her? They are both famous but she looks like she really wants to share her spot light and he’s like &quot;No thanks!&quot;

No actess couple did accept abhishek
<a href="">2:31</a> respect.

Aishwarya is next Sreedevi of Indian film history..better to ...

Look what's going on...what's going on you want to show...a little too...
Bach an family horr with crazy old jaya her arrogant daughter shveta where Aish life is spoilt

Abhishek have eago aishyarya is more popular than abhishek n she was affair with sallu and vivek

They both need to discuss how to appear in media. Get a manager or advisor dude

Cheap and downgraded media..Can&#39;t people have their bad n gd moments.

Who has given such a good hand to such a beautiful girl?
Omg Aishwarya is great don’t know how she tolerating abhishek and jaya

This is India's 🇮🇳's lower media which is going crazy.
Ky howa duno is not available
How to read pics and use media
He is stupid and  jeaouls. Poor Ashwariya.

Abhishek has lot of attitude.But being miss world she is down to earth

No one would feel the agony of Abhishek..who is made to feel inferior by rude behaviour of media and other

Abhishek should separate from this and get married again....Both of them are making their life hell.
Husbands nowadays promoting their wives .. Being their pillar for success. And this man is still following Orthodoxes. Very baad. Feeling bad for aishwarya the diva.

Shame on abhishek

This is called deception he didn’t misbehaving at all...media wanted her solo pics and he gladly asked her to do the same and she wanted to take pics with her husband only...but our media is so stupid they rarely will show truth and only wants masala for no reason...

Hate Amitap family 😭😭😭
So pathetic.... He really ignored her

Rich man always do that with wife too much attitude 😌

I can't say anything but the way you are looking, it's a wonderful lovely pair, please bless both of you..😊😊😊😊😊
Please don&#39;t spot private life and p

He is jealous of her. He thinks just because he is Amitabh’s son everyone needs to be under him! Oh plzzz get a life. She has her own worth talent came to the industry on her own. Not like Abhishek just because is father he became famous. He cant even act properly.

Of course what happened to your mother now?
Abhishek divorce aiswaria 😭😭
He is so lucky to have a wife like her but he is losing his good luck by own

This is what I thought Salman Khan would do. This since ages.
I married her with these flowers.
Actually I live in different ways just to take photos and show them to the world, who knows if these people have become different...
Mtlb kuch bhi

Nothing went wrong  I don&#39;t know why this media is so nosey and always wrong he just left her so she can click some picks alone as we all know how these camera man go solo solo so please stop giving fake news. Abishek is very well mannered and he know how to respect a woman.

Its totally fine..they r couple..it happns you cant expect all good all the time

Abhishek is a loser and complexed tht he isnt as successful as his wife

Aish is really good example of bhartiya Naari 🙏

She Actually Married Her Living Walking Enemy On This Earth.😂😂😂😂. Salman was a Boon to Her which She Rejected. He was willing to change Himself for Her

Finally When Aishwariya realised the Truth that Even after Marriage He is not really into Her😂😂😂😂

Abhishek is no gentleman

Abhishek ji kuch aisa kaam kro ki log tume be puche

even a little yaar
he knowz hes a loser , mammaz boy cant take ash and her stardom .. as well  as salmanman khan past

Which top producer made this top Abhishek a hero...
Normal 10 k sambla thagolige Thullmele kobb iruthe innu koti irolige iralva.. Joyhege vishwa sundari

Abhi got married to Karishma and Aish was perfect than Salman.
I feel bad for her

Not only a Good wife but also a very good mother

At least Salman wouldn&#39;t av done that.

One like by salman khan👍

No it wasn&#39;t like that. It was just an enactment from a film called Abhimaan. Exactly  as Amitabh displays his affection towards Jaya in a film.

Always want sensation

And I thought American media was terrible

<a href="">1:03</a> oh for God&#39;s&#39;s sake stop this! He is just allowing her to take solo shoot and you people have put such a terrifying background music and making this seem like some sort of serious situation!!!

Media spoiled their evening, look at the way her expression changed for solo shot.

Love u aishwarya❤❤❤
Love u aishwarya❤❤❤❤❤❤From nepal
Most successful guy&#39;s son and most successful actress... 😆😆😂😭

Is this in North India or South India

i think she not happy with him.

Thumbnail ki kya editing hain!!!! 😂 and iss video ke thumbnail ko dekhkar e pata chal jata hain kiii media ki memes ka jawab nhi!!!

Oh my god..... I told you that I have been a bachelor for 2 years so don't marry me in a hurry...
Everyone every couple hv their own issues but who want to live wd hz/hr partner always compromise so what is new??????dont poke

Aish yahan shaadi karke phas gayi bechaari lu mam u r a legend miss world

Ye sab dekh kar lagta h k agar media persons pit te h to wo galat nhi h

ye to har husband  our wife  me hota hai

C  the tension on ashwairya rai face...Abhishek on many occassion tried to embarrassed her .But she still carries herself gracefully.In our daily life there is often dramas of saas bahu but these celebrities also has to undergo through such situation its surprising

I don’t like really talking about people but this is reality peoplePeople wake up their marriage has been so bad long time ago that’s why they didn’t have second kid wake up!! Poor man look his fake smiling I could tell the smile it’s all fake he’s not happy you know I wish them the best

Not Soul mates.... Foul mates... 😂😂😂😂😂 Everything is for Sr. Bachchan including the Daughter in Law... Load on this thought is proven by The fact that, Grand Daughter looks neither like Aish Or Abhishek....but like Sr. Bachchan&#39;s daughter who married Nanda 😉

Aishwarya knows the value of love .

Solo shouta rhe h means ekela islia aishwrya ne ekele photo khichvaya
He is a decent man stop spreading such  rumours

Even these media people are not weird people.
Sincere and hardworking woman

Dis looka like seeing aashiqui 2 movie in real life ..y are husbands always get jealous on wife&#39;s success 🤬🤬
Ash is a good lady

Abi had full of complex...

it is not true ...abhishek very rude

Kamina Abishek.. 😡
2nd hand girlfriend bcom wife

Indian media is the worst media in the world

Guys this is between the couple why does the media always interfere in everything it is so disturbing and disgusting to do that I think the media should mind their own business 😡 If you agree please like 👍 🙏

Abhishek seems to be insecure

Whats up with this fake accent 😂😋🤣🤣

Oh God, wait..
He jealous from her

Fake news

He is so cheap!

Oh my gosh, QUEEN! In honour of Aishwarya Rai&#39;s birthday, I have put together a special birthday tribute! <a href=""> Check it out!!

Whenever this happens with Aisheriya...us's mood goes off...
If Aishwarya is unhappy in that family she should divorce, cuz it is seen that Aishwarya&#39;s eyes r everytime unhappy... Day by day she is bad look

Public ke samne ideal couple but in personal life, they are like kutte billi ki jodi hai.

Real beauty inside n out shame unlucky in loves he seems arrogant just like his mother. What a waste to hv such a beautiful soul n not appreciate her. Looser abbiseck bachchan!!!...

there is no life being a filmstar.

Aishwarya was not spared from marriage problems... due to Mil's interference... so what is this thing about her...lol
I love the Bachchan family I follow Amitan Bachchan since the 70s

Through all egos from the soul and think we are guest in this world our real home is with Almighty No one  have permanent home over here , EGO  &amp; stardom  MAKES EVERY WHERE PROUBLEMS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😎

YAAR... MEDIA... WHY DO ASK FOR SOLO PICS..WHEN COUPLES ARE HERE.... YOU ARE RUINING THE RELATIONSHIP...

Abhishek name must be abhiman

Please respect their privacy and leave them alone to lead their lives

Its not like that

She is married to a stupid little boy 😂

Abhi is so negative

The husband is simply idiot

What a drama my friend...what a cute couple you are. Stop this nonsense.
As a model Aishwarya will love photo shoots.. but why bachan family is treating her like this... She will be living happily if she married any other than him.. luv u ash😍😊

Ash is the best mother in Bollywood....Har khoobsurat women ko uske layak enshaan nhi milta.....

This is soo rude to leave Aishwarya​ like that and going in car.

shes nt right char left vivek this wat karma

Is chawal abhushek ko big b ki wajah se log janty hain

Lol.. This video creator really has no job to do.. Creating fake videos.. At first video, you guys can clearly seen that Aish went to enter the car from right side while Abhishek entering from left side.. And you useless media edited the video by inserting different picture into different shots.. Better get a life.. AISH - ABHI are made for each other.. And most powerful &amp; loved couple

There are mutual arguments, but it does not mean that there is a dispute between the two.&quot; But Abhishek should not have done all this in front of the media. He has got such a lovely and loving wife, Abhishek himself should be happy and should also keep her happy.
She made such a mistake marriage him. He is always angry

Pen yakkkk
Insecure lil boy jealous of her beauty and succes what a shame walking out on her while she is in the spotlight wow

hahahahahaha they are wearing white which means they have been to a funeral, this is why she is crying!

Yeh media wale sale harami

Can&#39;t blame the photographers for asking solo pic of Aishwarya. Abhishek looks like a can driver and would lower the standard of their pics.

Aishwarya is not at all set any example. There many many beautiful hands on mom who looks after home n professional life. She. Sells her story. She married a bachan a flop actir for. MoneyHe has nothing if left alone.

Who&#39;s here after Amitabh Batchan death
I'm sorry
He is suspicious. Aiswarya may also made mistakes. Anyway there is a mystery

kitno k sath to so chuki h ...ab to manage hi kregi or kya kregi 😆😆

Abhishek is clearly jealous of Aishwarya

What a bullshit video.  Media should be ashamed

Totally wrong of him to leave her by herself while he gets in the car first. Where are his manners? I can only imagine how he treats her behind closed doors

Ashwaria suppose to say why solo both of them actor and actress media are stupid to say solo solo alsoAshwaria  has to say we are couples I don’t need to take separate picture. To save her marriage she has to respect her Husbond Man has a pride they are like a baby you have to pamper them.

Awe I feel bad for Aish. She deserves the best.

Abhishek is too rude it&#39;s not nice for in public especially..

The way you calling Bacchan suckssss...yuk

Result of turning Salman Bhai's heart
Omg

Like an ugly asshole from mrd, those for x getting married x fame money x castes
Seems he is a bit hightempr

Abhishek seems jealous of Aishwarya 😁😍😘💋👍
Abhishek just let her photo SOLO.

if  Asiwarya or Abhishek see this comment........&quot; stop the attempt to please the world......atleast one day you live ...live a free life.....else its not worth it......&quot;

Abhishek is not happy with her publicity and how famous she is he is a kind of jealous

Itna act ker keh how a person can live in real life... It&#39;s really painful and hell for a media person it&#39;s harsh truth

It&#39;s not like that ...he is just allowing her to take single photos shoot for the media...with a smile... Misguiding the reality with horrible background music

If they go in separate cars there’s definitely a problem going on. I feel bad for aishwarya she looks so helpless by herself and unprotected without a loving husband. She deserves so much better and I pray she sees that ❤️

The whole thing is he dont want that ash took solo pic cz he feels uncomfortsble he dont like canera he cares for her he loves her

The event was the death of Aishwarya&#39;s father. Busted media gets 1.8 M view from this falls acquisitions. The chaos of society is created by their false news, Bollywood insight you are a shame.

Abhishek is so spoiled, he should calm the f down.

Abi  is feeling so much insecure infront of aishwarya .  She is so attention to everyone  n abi is nothing infront of aishwarya

After all you have given us these old fucks. Mahesh Manjrekar: Arre iski maa ki ch*t 🤣🤣🤣
Y he married her..she deserves better

Man is man, woman is woman, her position might be wherever, ok acceptable, because we are indians.  But Man y not allowed his woman alone, he has love, affection, care everything on her, because of these only he wont allow....please understand.  dont make confusions, they care themselves

Only after making the video he has given it to the public.
Come on he just let her take solo pic.... how it become like he is being rude to her .... will u stop this ...

Abhishek is a nice guy for her ...much better than Gunda Salman khan

Media to set fire to anyone's house
He says her to give solo pics becoz media says.. N fucking media interpreting the scene..Well i like aishwarya always coz she manage their prsnl life n professional life very well.. N its difficult to hide everything from media

Abishekh is so Ill-mannered he&#39;s a flop actor acting as if he&#39;s a mega star And he is often seen mistreating Ash

He just can&#39;t stand the fact that she&#39;s more popular then him and so he gets upset everytime.😄

He is very graceful and gives her her due..she has her own identity and she is known as aishwarya rai and not bachchans wife...also they may have to go to different locations or appointments and they left for that..y is it someone&#39;s business

Kchhh bhiiiiiiii

Every husband and wife fight ...!! If they don’t fight that means they are not living together or something is wrong  ....!! It’s good they fight ...it’s healthy .... it makes the bond stronger ....!! Keep fighting and keep loving back ...!!  Isn’t that how married people or people in love live ...!!

She doesnt deserve him.. she needs to divorce this man

Salmaan   would  Laughing   after   watching   this   🤣🤣😂😂

Finally whatever woman achieve in her life, but her struggles never end. 💔💔 Looking at her situation I felt so bad 😔 for her 💔

Hated Shweta Nanda she is just rascal 😡

Gandvaaaaaa sala
Amitab’s son behaves so ugly in public, you can’t behave like that, it’s disrespect for your wife IR to those around you
people this channel is fake .....the make up stories showing a small piece of vid aish knows hr husband.... and this is nothing but fakeotherwise she have married the brother of bollywood

He has huge complex.

Papanathi unku nalla teva
stupid abishak many times insult Aishwarya <a href="">rai.you</a> are a cheap person abishek you don&#39;t know value of aishu

Badjen badjen
The flower of your mind grows
One word: Jealousy

Actually hear Abhishek has no fault...... He just wanted to his wife in one single pic her in public camera.... Why public do this..... Uuffff

The world is watching. One can only perceived the character of this “Man”! Frankly more respect goes to the Lady who is so well behaved and carried herself very well. Kudos to this ever beautiful lady.

I think there’s a misunderstanding here i seems he doesn’t like camera alot, it doesn’t mean he is rude or ignored her wife

Why today's weather is like this?
Tho kya hua. Husband wife beech problem ho sakti hai. Its not a big deal. Aishwarya is a good wife, mom n dil bcuz she knowns how to balance her career and personal life ☺

She should leave him period!!

U married an actress, a beautiful actress, what is your problem Abhishek? I think he cannot handle or accept that is more popular than  him.

If Amitabh Bachchan's son was not there then why would Aishwarya Rai not be able to meet the person who doesn't deserve the things or if he gets the things of use then he would not be able to appreciate them.
Media saying solo so he stepped away
Those who love the wife will ignore the wife's goose...... haaaa haa i made it...😁😁
Just another immature n jealous man

Abhi don&#39;t no how to behave in public.wt his problem we don&#39;t no ego husband.

To the lady who is narrating at the end of like to say,ANGRAZI,NAHI AATI,TOH,TYPICAL GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME ACCENT KYU , BOLTHEY HO FUXKING DUMB BITCH BECAUSE OF YOU EVERY FOR A HAMARA MAZAK

Yrr this media has started this day. I am still doing it alone. Abhishek must have been hurt.
Lmaooo imagine the people telling her to take solo photos and him leaching off. He would come as selfish. I feel like he just wants to let her have her moment why are yall this mad at the man. It&#39;s the media hat is ruining their rela5

Again nothg bt shown in wrong way

Aisa hi chiye.. cheater ko she is nothing before also and now also

Aish is not beautiful why is everyone saying that she is not beautiful ugly woman I hate her

I met AbhisheK Bachchan in real life. He is so down to earth and he has lots of patience. Even Aishwarya is a great lady. Husband Wife mein aisa hota hai kai baar, ye log celebrity hai isiliye camera main aa jaata hai... warna agar aap married ho bataiyein aap ke sath aisa nahin hota?

This is what happens when langoor🦍's hand is filled with grapes 🤣🤣🤣
Achi bv ki qadar hee nhi 🥴
It&#39;s her life let her handle this on her own ....don&#39;t interfere in others life

Aishwarya acting in this video 👌

I thought he is a good person but he is mommies boy. Respect your wife. Learn from your father. She is someone&#39;s daughter. Then someone will respect your daughter

So much attitude abi has. Same like his mother. Mummies boy😡

Love u ash
There is no news like this. Main. write h
Every husband wife fights so kya yrrr itna mat bhadayo

She married him because of the status of the family in bollywood. She looks so unhappy. I&#39;m sorry to say but abhishek is tied to his mothers duppata. So if his mum has a problem so will he. Sorry to say but she is stuck. GOOD LUCK!!

The actual problem is that Abhishek and his family is not media centric...and coz Abhishek is flop he finds an excuse that he doesn&#39;t need media attention..n he is perfectly fine without media...on the other side Aishwarya likes to be in media always..she always wants to be a perfect one in front of the world..due to which I guess she is suffering and somehow have to maintain her relationship to be an ideal person..

She was Miss world of course she should pose to camera

Death ke uppar bhi paas kamaho saal... thumbnail chuttad jaise dala hua hai
Ishwarya doesn&#39;t deserve that behavior from her husband

Looks like she&#39;s not happy in her marriage. I don&#39;t want to get married anymore

Media people pl give some respect to their personal life and husband and wife relation..pl pl

He is total hypocrite always insult Aishwarya front of media and other peoples.

Tell me, you are absolutely crazy about your mother.
He is stupid!!

Report such fake channels

Iss chutie ke naam se bacchan hata do to kutta vi ni puchega. Public me behave ni ata.

Never more beautiful than yourself
Because of HER LOOK THAT UGLY ABHISHEK AND HIS MOTHER AND DAUGHTER AND FATHER ARE IMSECURE AMY ONE CAN SEE THAT

Cant understand why Aishwarya  is suffering in her marriage?Leave that rotten family.

True love has much price.

How to make it rain
Once Aishwarya gave her divorce, Abhishek's whole attitude would come out. Before this no one even realized that Aishwarya's whole attitude would come out. Poor Admi

I think Abhishek is jealous of Ishwarya Geetha mysore

Having miss world by ur side won&#39;t give u happiness until u are biased by a bad and jealous family

There is actually no fight here, ulta abhishek is showing lot of respect

She is India&#39;s GODDESS...she should DIVORCED that weakass NO GOOD PIECE OF SHIT HUSBAND. Aish! Plenty of men will be HONOR to have you next to him. NEVER let that SHIT ever embarrassed you again

Vadoka flop jero.Pelli photos ammukunna valla nanna zero.Ash u r deceived.
Divorce him 😬😬😬
<a href="">0:51</a> why he so rude

They are never happy in front of media

Sabke family me problems hote hai.. Usme kya badi baat hai.. Gussa karneka right unko b hai.. After all they r humans like us.. If they are filmstars so wat.. Why do this media run behind their personal lives.

I never liked Ash mu entire life but after seeing dese clips i feel sorry for her how she must be felt after her husband left her behind alone

I never liked Ash mu entire life but after seeing dese clips i feel sorry for her how she must be felt after her husband left her behind alone

There is no limit to this donkey who is showing so much emotion, Abhishek has no limit to his chutiya.
He looks toxic tbh

He always does this to her, feel pitty for her.....he does not deserve our miss world

Yrr kitna bakwash bolty ho TM log wo log b Insan h kuch life my unky b normal hota hr chij Ko unki high light krna y thik Ni😠

If you reject Salmaan then this is what will happen to him😡
Fake

A strong successful lady always face an worst journey in marriage life

In india ppl are very crazy to know about the personal life of celebrities while we pakistanis do not take great care of this thing that whats going in the lives of showbiz personalities😊

She married him for the fame shame couples are not for each other can&#39;t stand the bachchans regards from Pakistan and UK

They are celebs. They know to deal with media. Dramtic sounds daal k scene create nahi chahiye

This is fake. The car in which Abhishek is sitting and the car which left are totally different. So stop showing fake news.

Famous father&#39;s son..... Famous lady&#39;s husband... What else he want...?

If u r a celebrity your life belongs to the public there no need to show the world u rude to your wife insecure men ash should just dump him

Abhishek is jealous of ashwariya cause she is talented famous and everyone notice her first in media not abhishek.....as for abhishek he is not that famous unless having bachchan name he can&#39;t be like his dad never im not happy but that&#39; my opinion

Angry young man but not successful as his father. It&#39;s not his fault.its very hard for starkids to be successful. He is a good actor but very arrogant, arrogance killed him.

I don&#39;t know how tragedy life that Aishwarya is facing with Abhishek...............

He just doesn&#39;t like cameras

She is very arrogant bas achi hone ka dikhawa karti h abhi nice guye

Bachannn 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rubbish...
It seems like he does this a lot to her. May be the case that the media may just want pictures of Aishwarya alone that her husband keeps leaving her but her gestures say otherwise. Others defend him saying it&#39;s the media but her facial expression is very real and sad. She wants a partner that is there for her and with her at all times. Hence, they are a married couple. He thinks because she&#39;s a world star that she wants all that light to herself?

What is that shitty accent? Her voice and accent are so irritating

Look this media Is very cheap abshiek is going in Benz car but aish is standing infront of some other car waiting for her car but they misleading the title like that

Divorce him and get a Life

Y to think negative, maybe he don&#39;t like taking much pics, media sometimes don&#39;t leave n make people irritate, or maybe media ask for solo pics

How rude Abhishek Bachchan.... Respect your women.respect your love

There is no love between them.just for name sake marriage.she acts off camera also.he is professionally weak compared to her and his insecurity,inferiority is show this way.

Aishwarya deserved a way way better family and she was on top of her career yaar 😭

Camera men were shouting solo ma&#39;am solo.. But nobody is listening that. Abhishek is very a nice person.

Aishwarya is kohinoor

Itni pyari lrki nq shadi ki itni bury lrki s. This is divorce law. Ashwrya will never find such a girl but Jahil is the only one who will ever meet her.
Treat a women like this she will stick to you for life. Women like difficult things not men who are 24/7 lovy dovy and available.Ignore all the advises given by women below in the comments sections.Mark my words and keep my advise.Regards,Nawabzada Samiullah khan.

Waste husdand
She truly deserves more than him 💯

Media MC h

Video bana ne vale jo image dikhate ho wo seen to bataya karo pehle fir dusri batein Kara karo

He is very jealous of his wife&#39;s publicity

Cameraman is playing pranks 😡 ladies first 😓 no mistake this time
What an asshole.

This cheap media will poke into actors personal life ... abhi was just giving her space for photoshoot and that’s it .. cheap media put all your assumption to trash and focus on better journalism . India has many other things to focus on

When wife is more successful why husbands are jelous?

A Real Man doesn&#39;t leave his woman standing like that sad😥

Aishwarya married for money

Thank god salman you didn’t marry her she is really such a bloody bitch

Okay- chill outShe’s crying bc they both left a funeral, and maybe he had an errand/relative to visitThe media makes things up and puts good people in a dramatic light - let’s be smarter then that

Her husband is Idiots!!!

I think avishek is jealous of her being a bigger star than him

OMG,  Im  very  Sad  for  her.😢😢😢😢😢😢
Evry time he insults her in front of media aish is so adjustable

1st video she has been not aishwariya

Rondu bachan
It&#39;s normal

This wife got TB attitude and what did she do?
Abhishek does not do any thing wrong....cameramen asked for solo picture of aishwarya.

Leave them alone...

Salman khan sir loves her a lot she missed such a great human being and married him what she will get this only  happen but it&#39;s very painful for the women in front of everyone

Who know Abhi still had a pain for somebody coz he already had engaged with somebody

This dude is such an ass. Marries one of the most beautiful lady in the world and treats her like crap!

You don't speak or think a lot about any person, here is the log of some thought, brother, let's make our own video so that we can judge you too, what is happening in their family, they know from the beginning that only those who speak know how to speak. hey
esme kya hi 2.2 k likes
I think he just let his wife shine more than him cause he knows what he got

Bilkul not wrong Abhishek..is gentleman…media vale hi..ASA wrong dikha ke delte fehhehni he…neither Abhishek nor Asvrya me kya bhavyar me bhi vivar me hec…very much understanding…Lv u .. abhi and asy...god bless u
He is just a jealous idiot!

It won&#39;t be good it&#39;s their personal

He&#39;s not even 5 percent of aishwarya rai

Very jealous husband
Amitabh Bachan and Aish would have been a better couple than his son. Feel bad for Aish living with her horrible mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Imagine being forced to live with people jealous of you and your husband has no back bone to stick up for you. She doesn&#39;t deserve this. She&#39;s more successful than all of them, the most beautiful person in the world and is stuck with these low-class jealous asswholes. She should take her husband and child and live separately from her in-laws.  Life is short and she shouldn&#39;t compromise her happiness for inconsiderate Indian standards.  Vivek and Salman fight for this women and she married this unsuccessful loser. Get a divorce or move out!

She is more famous than him 😂

he is badly jealous cz She is getting more attention in public . surly he is doing this to embarrass her since he feels he doesn&#39;t deserve her or he is less than her ....so that&#39;s how he pays her back.... I&#39;ve seen too many vedios he  just rudely let her go in public instead of be happy for her and support her ....

RANDI SADHI'S THEM FOR MONEY
Vvvv lovely couple Never judge wrong i think ppls r showing jealousy by giving fault comments... against the couple...

It’s very easy to impress ladies! Little concern,little appreciation, little love! If a man can’t provide these things ! He is a failure case!

U left our salman so u desrave it.......lol funny
I'm always confused about it
Looking at these comments, media seems to be getting what they want. Come on people, stop believing in stories made by media!

Aish spoil her life and her heart

He is so rude to her jealous insecure asshole he always insults her in public and then when everyone is like ash ash let’s click a picture he just leaver her there and walks away to deal with humiliation

He felt humiliated just because of the cameras as they pretend as they just wanted Aish to be done with that&#39;s why he is leaving Aish alone

But every husband wants her wife to be what to say only his treasure

Cant stand the bachchans.  She deserves a way better husband

I love Salman khan ❤️❤️❣️ only Salman
This shows his zero confidence level..

It goes two ways

Instead she is miss world as a women she is facing like this problems

He is mad  he got this miss universe easyly so he don&#39;t know the value of her

Think who talking this lady if I talk like you talk unknown wht happened in your life.. better to stop to talk like this thing..to make view your YouTub. For what you doing like this???

You know who doing unknown thing .you do your self to publish your YouTub with other name!!

I love aish
It is husband and wife fight in life . it is not a big problem.

See the jealousy on his face........ Fucking loser don&#39;t know what the fuck 👇🙄👇 did Aishwarya see in him.......

Monkey in Langgor's mouth
Ya

Cmon .. Theres ntnhlg wrong .. Hes just dont want to take share in her sucess. His being a man . Letting her njoy her stardome.. Media plz get some life

She needs to leave him

He always  do that...  Pehle bhi kiya hai..  Photo ke tym wofe ko chodd ke jana..  Jealous hai kya..

Fuck abhisakh

This is called baddua lagna salman khan ki baddua hai.
<a href="">3:52</a> how she looked at her husband

Abiman

Abhyshk  he is loser and ash is beautiful and famous so he feels jealous of her...

Sweta Nanda is staying at home this night..Bharti will be at Abhishek's house.
Abhimaan 2
Ye teak nahi hi Abhishek
Abhiman ki story
He’s a stupid guy

&quot;We wonder what went wrong&quot;  don&#39;t wonder, leave them alone!

Ghattya insan

She should leave him

He is a loser. Idiot.

Chhota Bachhan has a heavy dose of inferiority complex! The Bachhans are a one big dysfunctional family and bechari Aishwarya is trapped in the middle!

Abhishek seems to have seen a lot of Abhiman movies.
acting in real life is hard.

I don’t know y but I get v positive vibes from ash in her every relationship I feel her a v dedicated wife and a v dedicated mother

Actually she is more successful than him more popular

At least when you can&#39;t do anything right in Bollywood then just appreciate what your wife does there. Don&#39;t be jealous. After all it&#39;s your wife. She ultimately goes your home and stay with you. But yes you don&#39;t deserve her.

He&#39;s one jealous little prick!

next time go to ur true love,not passion and money,thousands of men a waiting for u,

He left her to shoot her pics not fighting

Wht is the actual problem in Aishwarya and Abhishek may be Abhishek is not satisfied with his carrier and he is totally out from films as his father mother and wife was super star which he couldn&#39;t achieved tht complex is if thr it will ruined the peace in life if something like this is there

He doesnt deserve her
Abishek Bachan looks like a good person, it seems like if you look at it&quot; , so his wife just gave up
This video is reminding me <a href="">#abhimaan</a> movie 😔
If he treated me like that I would send him flying. It's not the first time he's done that rude thing to her.
Abisek jeleous with his wife

Hes too gud for her stupid woman only married him for his big family name!!! Everyone knows that shes just stupid n a manupilater😠  Nothing about her is beautiful a woman with a beautiful heart is beautiful not fake ones like her 😐😐😐

abhishek looks jealous becz of aishwarya&#39;s beauty,fame and success

He is showing his male dominating.

This is called Langoor's main grape.Abhishek Langoor
We do know what&#39;s going on in her  personal life but abi shouldn&#39;t live her in front of media like that

They are good couple This media , society make it as issue further

I think he jealous by aish

such an insecure person....so fickle minded....he wanted a successful independent girl as wife....but dont want a wife to be more successful than him...🤔

Abhishek don&#39;t know how to give respect to her beautiful wife Aishwarya Roy

I think she&#39;s crying as they just came out of a funeral?! 🤷‍♀️

simply paying the prize to merry the name BACHACHAN

Dont know their personal issues but it seems to me that he is insecure because she is such a beauty. He could have just embraced her.

Abi to nokar lagta ha

You guys should leave this lady alone, if you think she is not happy with her marriage then she have the right to divorce her husband and start living a normal life style or don&#39;t you know she is pregnant with her s cond baby? Be warned

She is so angry but her husband is not showing how much she has achieved.😓😢😢😢
Sala wife zydaa beautiful bbhi nahi honi chhyieee
I think she&#39;s making a big deal of it by asking Abhishek to stand with her and embarrassing him even though media is asking for her solo pic. Its quite the norm for media to ask for solo pics of beautifully dressed bollywood divas. It does not mean that he is being ignored like the way she&#39;s making it out to be.

Actually Abhishek is right i have leaked clip of Aishwarya

This is also a big fight between husband and wife in thousands of houses...Actors are also such human beings, whom we (public) have made famous.
Oh

He seems like a drama queen. She is mother of over acting. They are made for each other 😂

that is y I think successfull women or women even with one step higher designation or more salaried than partner should not marry such guys ,.....becoz even though men of such will propose ,show all love care n all protecting stuff before marriage,but after marriage men will always be in an INFERIORITY COMPLEX or can say uncomfortable with wife as she is more successfully or earning more ,even if wife is gud and try to keep things comfortable ,....there very few men who will b comfortable of a wife who is more famous than him ,its true ,nd that attitude should change .....

All Salman is not hote bhabiji
Abhisheks mad because she still moans Sallu Sallu while he screws her

my favorite actor Abhishek bacchan

He seems to be too rude. He doesn&#39;t deserve our miss world 😕

In cinema aiswariyarai ji was the superstar .abisek was nothing. But in the public functions he saw his arrogant against aiswariyarai ji. Abisek was not a good choice for aiswariyarai ji.

Feel bad for abhishekHe is amazing actor.Sadly he is insecured of his wife n thats completely acceptable.It could happen with everyone. Since he is celebrity its difficult to be positive, confident due to media, public, fans. He deserves chance to get movies than over acting actors like salman khan.

Langoor kye hath.....☹️
Apne problems ko itne ache se deal karte hai , she is a wonderful lady in the world

oh shut up your voice and english accent is iriritating

In the second clip I THINK that abhishesk bachan was asking ashwariya to take picture

Aish aunty J Pachta ryi hogi ye lallu ko chunkr

Aish is the most beautiful woman in the world, married to the most arrogant, really not that good looking man in Bollywood....

Aishwarya...don&#39;t hold hands all time .... It&#39;s so irritating....

Everyone in bollywood is narrcasistic including Aishwarya. She married him for a family name  and admits she never had a crush on Abishek.  So she got a family name but a miserable marriage. She admits they fight everyday like an old couple. Fotage like these are slipups in public and reveal a troubling image. What a miserable existence. Atleast unlike other women she has her career to fulfill her other than her family life.  But she is just as fake as anyone else.

Why the fuck did she marry this flop diva queen!

Her husband is not pretty man at all what she see in him idk

Aish left Salman for this day of marriage 🤣🤣🤣
Aish has beautiful face and soul

These two will divorce. Likhe le lo. I hope they dont. But I feel like it.

Marriage in bollywood is like take retake then packup nothing stable cz nobody wants to comes down when they r on the top of an ivory throne.

Fucking news.when one have nothing to do they search all these fucking things.bloody reports from bloody fuckers

He is jealous guy

He should be lucky to have the most beautiful woman in the world, but I guess he wanted her as a trophy. He is just a flop actor son of a superstar. Sorry for her.

Oh my God...poor Aiswarya Ray. She is very professional but her husband is sensitive, why not marry Salman Khan <a href="">aja.ni</a> Abisek is already ugly, annfkuh
Who cares😝

Salman khan se Sadi ho te axa hota
Salman s shadi ker lati wo kader tu kerta
What happend😐

Abhishek jealous feel with ash bcoz ash is a great actor successful lady he is not

Fake video

she should dump his ugly ass.. she deserves real love

Very beautiful woman but very stupid why she didn’t devors this marriage

Fake beauty

Abishek is not a Man and gentlemen for aishwarya... She is better than him

she would have make a very good pair with Salam abheshak doesn’t look nice with her she made mistake to leave Salam and chose him

He is so streng 😮😮 or so spoiled

Yeh idiot jealous hy Aish sy or wesy Aish ko credit hy k wo shadi abhi tk nibha hi rhi hy.
Yeh complex zada admi
Every husband and wife fight many times in life . It&#39;s not so big problem.

Why she married him...

Poor Aishwarya can’t even express her feelings and emotions frankly because of the paparazzis!

seen the one where she hugs tendulker in front of him

Ew throw the whole husband away

Abhishek jealous of his own wife&#39;s fame... Cheap guy

Do not blame Abhishek cameraman do not want to take his pictures they need Aishwarya pictures so he left

seems to be case of husband being jealous of wifes success.....

Some people may feel about beauty...but the truth is many beautiful ladies were not lucky enough to get love and attention they need from their husband and loved ones...that&#39;s the worst pain which made us think God y u have given beauty to me😔

Abhishek is very rude to her

Don’t know why she married him he’s jealous and childish and insecure.

Aishwarya paavam
Kyu shadi ki is bekar Insan sa Salman is better than abhi

She says bachan in a really funny way🤣

This drama has not happened, it has been used for fucking.
Standing near her Mother wearing the same Clothes.She should wear the same Hair as well(The silver Company)

I lv her dress
Aishwarya Rai more deserve get a Man more better than Abhisek!!

What&#39;s this sir sir ma&#39;am ma&#39;am. These media people are slaves. No journalist in the West calls celebs as ma&#39;am or sir.

Can&#39;t you see anyone happy?

Its such difficult moment for every beautiful women whenever we r plz support it.its mean people don&#39;t create any problem with her personal life.

All women&#39;s face the problem

Aishwarya is suffocating in that family...

She is not happy here life 😔😔😔😔

Their family is a fake..  Aish I am so pity on you..  Amithabh and jaya bachhan wants their daughter should get people expectations.. So they are trying to defame aish&#39;s repo.

Aish you married to a wrong person

Everything around Abhishek is a famous thing except himself ..huhu

Iska to yeh hona hi tha gold digger Ash

Abhishek is a fool he left the world most beautiful woman like that

1. Instagram@nehakapoormp2. Facebook page<a href="">#nehakapooractress</a>3. Twitter<a href="">#mumbaineha</a>4. Tiktok@nehakapoor10august5. YouTube channelNEHAKAPOOR0076. Short film &quot;Encounter&quot;<a href="">

Fake video..presented wrongly

Abhishek very jealous
Abhishek is as good as he looks.
Aishwarya is best I don&#39;t like Abhishek

He is à asswhole
Why do they always fight before going out in front of media?? 😂

Its normal

Abhi is also jelous with ash coz his films always goes flop

I love aishwarya she proved that she is a perfect wife n bahu too...abhi is getting influnced by her sis

It&#39;s so obvious cameramen scream for a solo pic of aish which embarrasses Abhishek and he tries to leave which clearly aish doesn&#39;t want. She is trying hard to balance.

It&#39;s called karma

Ash you dont need to tolerate these neglections...y dont you quit from his life to liberalise yourself free

Why does she puts up with his crap if this was USA she will kick his ass what a looser

Only those from the house can upload the video whenever they want, there is a huge chittar parade 😁😁😁
Marriages in bollywood are meant only  business deals  so  their interpretation of happiness is totally different.

The use of media will last forever
Click baited once again

to kia hoa thora bht to chalta jahan peyar or rishta ho

She doesn&#39;t look too happy.

Why she married that idiot abhishek

Aishwarya will one day walk out and go to Salman Khan. After which Abhishek Bachchan will still be unemployed, left alone and broke. Wish Amitabh could have stopped giving him his pocket money after his first movie.

The most beautiful woman in the world but he doesn't deserve her, he's an ass.
The media is not going to mssala chaida bus
Yrrr kise di personal life toh tusi ki lena ...its not your right
Beauty is a heavy cross! Everyone wants to test the beauty's patience to see her emotions, tears and how she will or will not cope with troubles. Lord, help Aishwarya Rai always and everywhere! give her strength to bear the cross.
Abhishek has ego pblm. He is jealous on Aish fame

Every beautiful woman have no luck in love and marriage don’t know why our husbands treat us like that

Media is the reason for there unhappy marriage life

Every couple on earth have arguments and disagreements! Aishwarya and Abhishek are human beings. So there’s a possibility of them having disagreements and arguments. It’s normal! Why is this news?? Also, it’s evident that Abhishek can’t handle or deal with a successful, driven, famous, independent woman/wife/partner. He has major insecurities. Well, that’s not Aishwarya’s fault or problem! She should continue to shine bright like a diamond! No one can or should stop that!

change the narrator , very bad voice and accent

Jaya is a reason of their unhappy marriage

Beauty

What a terrible accent. Even disgusting.
he is such a loser !!!!

Because of these media people, how many couples' marriages have failed. Pl film K Siva is also a human being, just to run you tube channel. Defeat all these things so that all this will become true in your life.
Get a devorce already jeeeezzzz
Shes just become so full of herself and its obvious abhishek is very irritated by it...  he always tries to look happy but sometimes noticeable...  i dont blame the poor guy, shes become so fake and pompous.  So embarrasing to watch...

Aish sooo tired 😥😥😢
We shouldn&#39;t interfere in personal matters

Jealous .bastard
Wowww...so cute ash

He just like his mom so no choice for ash

Why is he always dissing her?

Reminds me movie of ABHIMAN

Don&#39;t make issue may be he had some work somewhere and that&#39;s y he left Alone ...kuch v

Actually there was affair between amitabachan and aswariya rai. To bring her close he got her married to abishekh son

Lot of ladies try to hide realty of there husbands..jealousy, lazy,poor minded <a href="">husbands.love</a> aysh..

Ha ha ha Aishwarya oma 👧
Hahahah..This guy should be a dialogue writer

Any how Aishwarya managing her personal life problems going forward. She is an example for others .

Poor Abhishek ...how cheap media persons were mocking him

Aishwarya showing attitude she walked away and showed her index finger .she should have made him wait and gone first if she was right

Ash n Abhishek best beautiful couple hai

Your wife, how many times a day will you wake up if you keep this video in the camera, you will never forget to sleep in other people's bed.
Very artificial behaviour. Poor people.24 hours they must be scared of these cameras

Actually aish she s homely she s managing the situation

NICE

He is igoist

abhishek is cut

No peace
media is the biggest culprit.

Bhusan kumar
Aishwarya is using abhishek as servent

Amir baab ka.... Ek ugly beta  ...super flop hero  a. B

The way she used n abused poor vivek n left him crying staying happy with another man is obviously difficult because it is a what goes around comes around world!

Shame on you 😡 It&#39;s not like what you&#39;ve written. As watching this video we can understand they&#39;re supporting each other. Abishek has came to take pictures being beside his wife... Is that really Nothing to you??.. <a href="">0:50</a> The problem caused by rude photographers shouted <b>&quot;SOLOOOO&quot;</b> Actually they said we don&#39;t want Abishek in our photos so he went to the corner and wanted Aishwarya take photos alone... <a href="">2:06</a> As you can see she Couldn&#39;t Stand either.. She seemed really sad and angry( It&#39;s not about Abishek cause when she went and took his hand seemed happy..) And after some seconds went along with her husband. It shows they love each other and Aishwarya didn&#39;t want harm her husband because of some worthles picture ❤ At the end want to write I&#39;m not in Abishek&#39;s fan club or somethimg like that; I&#39;ve just written what obviously happening in video and can see it with my own eyes.

Ash is beautiful n well talented .this man who is her so called husband jealous from her n shows his ugly attitude in public to disgrace her but he himself is disgracing.she is showing her eastern wife love n faith but he is rude n rough.

This is love stupid when you love someone u always fight

That's what he deserves.
Husband wife laren ge nhi to piyar kese barhe ga ye sab normal cheze hn

Don't worry. I shared my words in front of the outside media, and I fell in love inside. Bus.
Yes. This video shows some difference of opinion, where Abhishek is just not in mood. By his body language, he is negative, and asks Aishwarya to carry on the show. It&#39;s just a husband and wife Tiff, common in family. God bless them and be happy and blessed both of you.

Aish dragging Abhi for poses forcibly 😂.

They came from a funeral stupid upload

They must fight in the bedroom not front of people that&#39;s showing no respect for a woman. Sad

Nonsense video.

If it true he ugly self acting just like he mother

Hoor ke sath langoor why did she marry him?She is beuty queen she could have found someone handsome

Ash u don&#39;t deserve him separate hojao and happy raho

Of course media will take her solo pics ,what is new in that ?

Aishwarya and Abhishek both make such a cute beautiful couple.

Fucking

Jin logo ka apna khane,pine rhne ka thikana nhi vaise log b AbisheK ko jobless btate h. Aur jgre kon se hus wife m nhi hote.

where She Cried Media Thera bop ka Gharme 😂😂

Because yes she is a celebrity, every bit of news is being reported by the media, so Abhishek should respect Aishwarya. Miss World Aishwarya is not anyone's demand but because she is an Indian, she tries to suck her daughter. Abhishek should respect her.
Fake news....

Yaar kis husband and wife me jhagda ya behes nhi hota,,,,just the difference is ki kuch logo ka dikhta hai sir kuch ka dikhai nhi deta

He needs to behave well coz she&#39;s that much beautiful no man needs to lose such a beauty 😍

Poor Abhi 😍😍😍
Media People are so cheap
These media are the ones who give us the opinion...if ever they come to our border...and interview the soldiers...about the condition of the vehicles...cleanliness and eating habits...main.. .
