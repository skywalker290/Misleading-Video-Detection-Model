why fuckin hell do you need to count your finger man like cmon

This aged like fine wine 😂

bros literally stealing the idea on camera lmao, dude at least read the description before copying it lmao!

<a href="">7:36</a> ana hahahaha😂

Why are you copying SSSniperwolf? She sucks.

wow this game takes me back. flash game from early 2000&#39;s. I missed 3 questions the first time I played, I was quite drunk though. 4 quarts in a cup. that one can be guessed from context. The first time i heard &quot;quart&quot; my brain made it &quot;quarter&quot;

at least felix admits to stealing... unlike someone else in this video

WATCHING THIS IN 2023 WITH ALL THE SSNIPERWOLF DRAMA MAKES THIS VIDEO SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A MASTERPIECE PEWDS IS  A GENUIS

The word SWIMS is SMIWS backwards. How was that correct ?

Yoo we have the same birthday month

yo

pewpew

bro i fucking love pewds 😩

What do u mean 2+2 =22 it&#39;s not its 4

2+2=22 <a href="">7:08</a>

Wat state is this <a href="">1:34</a>

this test has has 111 questions and i&#39;m rewatching it when pewds is having 111M subs 😅😂🤣

<a href="">5:33</a> The word :0

So this is why Sssniperwolf gets the idea that EVERBODY copies her

<a href="">5:21</a> what was the word??

What is your favorite color?Ana...😂

<a href="">1:50</a> pewds: 6 times 3 is 12lel

<a href="">12:20</a> is the just number of his subscribers,that was odd

He speak swedish in the end

Pewds Deserves to be the number 1 channel again

PewDiePie your awesome

20 are in a quart

THERE ARE 31 DAYS IN JANUARY

Back when he was good(read the rest)Sive I was just kidding, he is still the best

Our lord is a freak <a href="">7:38</a> ❤

Чё

Yo my birthday is also in October

Game: shows 2 rabbits Felix: &quot;two rabbits&quot;Game: shows 4 moreFelix: &quot;five rabbits&quot;💀

<a href="">7:36</a> 👁️👄👁️

You know i would get mad for him stealing SSSniperwolfs thumbnail but i really cant because he is PewDiePie

Apparently Felix and I share the same Birthday Month. BIG PP!!!!

zero deaths!

I love how i was on shorts and i saw ssniperwolf because it was shown and i thought.... ah. That may be an ok channel if pewdiepie is talking about it. Then i searched ssniperwolf and this video was first before any ssniperwolf ones XD

🏋️‍♀️

<a href="">8:59</a> It&#39;s so funny how he is actually counting his fingers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">8:57</a> bro literally had to count his fingers 💀

I love the fact that it is the same title lol

Bro&#39;s Jeffrey Dahmer ;d

Q: what&#39;s your favourite colorpewdiepie : anal/

SWEDISHSVENSKA

DO NOT USE JESUS CHRIST FOR NON SENSE EXPRESSION PLEASE🥺

swims backwards is smiws. Am i not getting something?

Bro try to beat the t searis brofist✊👊👊👊👊

<a href="">7:37</a> Wtf

30 days have September April June and November, all the rest have 31, except February which has 28

2+2=4

<a href="">6:12</a> I am in tears at. Brain very large

PewDiePie remember when you said the two and two you were wrong it&#39;s not 22 it&#39;s four 2 + 2 is 4 because you don&#39;t know

As of now, PewDiePie have the same Million subscribers as the number of questions in the test.

some of these are just incorrect. for example swims is not the same backwards, forwards and upside down. backwards is smiws

I&#39;m a fan of Mr beast and you

First time watch this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I also don&#39;t have ideas in every Sundays 🤨

111M subs and 111 questions! such a quinsedence!

It&#39;s OK you still have Edgar

<a href="">1:28</a>

Never learned the knuckle trick .. 🤔

Watching after scoring very low in jee

I don&#39;t like Mathematics

PLS FINISH SUBNAUTICA GET CURED AND ESCAPE THE PLANET 4546B

at the time i am watching this vidio he has 111 million subscribers

last

<a href="">4:10</a> Why&#39;d he suddelny develop and Irish accent.

My favorite color is also anal

<a href="">12:00</a> nuckles didn&#39;t lie, you counted 5+3 because one hand all knuckles and other hand 3, but you forgot that you don&#39;t count your thumb&#39;s nuckle so it&#39;s 4+3=7, not 8

What gets me the most is the question about how many months have 28 days

that wasnt the metric system

Wtf is the knuckle test?

all monts have 28 days 😌

X = 6

I love that it’s Sniperwolf lol

<a href="">7:37</a> pewds favourite colour

GOOSE FEATHERS YIU HAVE TO CARRIE THE WAIT OF WHAT YOU DID TO THOSE POOR BIRDS ALOT OF PEOPLE WILL NOT GET THE JOKE

has he not watched 101 dalmatians sadness

<b>adjusts glasses</b>Akhtually, the pope is not Catholic. The person we call the pope is officially called the head of the bishop of rome, vicer of Jesus Christ, the successor of the prince of the apostoles, supreme pontiff of the universal church, the primate of italy, archbishop, metropolitan of the sovereign state, servant of the servants of god.The <i>actual</i> pope is the pope of the Orthodox church of Alexandria. His real title is the Pope of Alexandria and the patriarch of all Africa on the holy sea of Saint Marcus, the apostle.So TL;DR:The one we call the pope is not the pope and the one who is the pope is not a roman Catholic.

My birthday is on 7 October

Quart and gallons one was 4 the answer both of them

There are so easy

Neither

<a href="">10:39</a> Why cAn&#39;T  hE????????!!!!!!!!!!!! pls explain !!!!!!!!11

I didnt mess up yo

2 + 2 = 4

February has 28 days. But the thing is, every four years, on the leap year, there’s 29th February, also known as, Mayday. It’s the day when May, a young girl with the power to grant wishes had died. This is the day children make wishes and celebrate as a holiday, supposedly. If you are confused, to be precise, one year consists of 365.242... days, not just 365 days. So we take that left bit of days and every four years, on the leap year, thus creating an extra day slotted into February, as the 29th. Btw, there are 7 months in a year that has 31days!👌

For no 4 I use the backward method by 13-4=9, 9x2/3=6..and in Asia(Singapore 4 me) — — = + (minus minus is plus). I think this easiest test ever is mainly easy if you are straightforward and don’t think to much, or second guess yourself: basically, if you are someone who thinks a lot, you probably tend to think too much and get it wrong.

swims backawds is smiws i belive
