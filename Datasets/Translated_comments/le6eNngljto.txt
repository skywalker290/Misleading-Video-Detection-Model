Who have watched Dice media?

I am really inspired for your speech  thanku so much

Thank you ayush sir. Your speech is very funny  and at the same time meaningful. I feel to share this inspiration content. What a content especially I like &quot;Every body face rejection&quot;. Rejection is a gift to learn our weakness &amp; it&#39;s right solution. I faced so many rejection in my interviews but now I get a great job &amp; I feel very happy. Hardworking is most important is a true word. Every have goal but few person are achieve their goal. The secret is they&#39;re enjoy the process.

Saw half of your talk really dunno how they pit you on this platform

I really like this ted talk and feeling inspired. But at the same time a point which ayush sir have pointed is &quot;Enjoy the process&quot; and live in the moment. This video is also stress buster. Really loved this video and looking forward to follow the life lessons given by sir.

Really funny actor your journey was so tough . great guy.

Enjoyable speech , well said, I salute your mother, sister, and your GF .

So cute you are  love you i became fan of your

AmazingBy the way I didn&#39;t inspire from his speech while I inspired from his smile whatever difficulties we get in our life always give a smile and the problem lost from your life 

The way he said &quot;get up and geyd out..that shows he gas a good acting skillamazing

I&#39;m watching for ayush filter copy

<a href="">21:00</a>

Good luck starrr of 10000 points

Wow great advice ️
Real inspiration ayush mehra
You are not a doctor
<a href="">3:00</a> - I have no family, no frnds, no frnds of frnd&#39;s, no family of frnds in this industry. <a href="">3:10</a> - But luckily I had a frnd in Shiamak who was an actor. We are not denying that he hasn&#39;t struggled or worked hard, but why to say I didnt knew anyone in this industry but a frnd of mine was actor. May be he hasn&#39;t practised or forgot to improvise his speech.

Whenever I saw him I just remember - Let&#39;s make the parrtyyyy 

Yrrr venkat ...yrrr tmm..

Jjb3c. ACEC9TT  @9 I zf poo zg o e ft 93ki6y.v

It&#39;s just two days I started watching his series and i am already him fan man.....  literally he is awesome.

I am leaving this post here as a form of gratitude, since that is one of the least thing I could do to appreciate the things Mr mike Henry as done for me Most of us has tried a lot of methods but we keep missing it because we have no personal guide.

Yes Ayush...you inspired me :)

His story is very much similar to SSR... Joining samak, became  background dancer, gave auditions those are very close to SSR&#39;s story..and I am afraid of lost him..i really don&#39;t want to lost one more aspiring actor, one more SSR..be very careful dear

You shouldn&#39;t have entered the comment section bruh , there is a bunch of Stans in here...u won&#39;t survive so I would rather say don&#39;t scroll down

Thank you sir
No matter how depressed I&#39;m.. Ur look always put up a smile on my face

Woww............Superb yr 
Shaurya
Amazing actor 
A brilliant speaker....Ayush reminding me about SSR in his every sentence....from Shyamak to acting.....and talking about breaking the targets and achieving them....so similar he sounds.....

<a href="">18:32</a> the best lines ever

Opration MBBS series  in very good  acting 

Yrr he makes me smile without any reason ️️

Good luck friend...!
Cutest smile...Expressive eyes...Really hardworking and talented actor...His face cut is quite similar to HARSHAD CHOPRA...His struggle reminds me of SSR...God bless you Ayush...keep shining...best wishes for your future...

Whenever I see him, I remember his signature line, “Let’s make the paaaaaarty..”

Ayush Mehra I am a big fan of yours since the first time I saw your acting.N not to deny the fact you are so cute and charming and an attraction to my eyes.This talk was highly motivating and inspiring.Keep shining and nailing it always.Its my dream to meet you one day.

Better than varun dhawan

Really inspiring

Operation MBBS fans

I think the pandemic has taught people a big lesson, having one stream of income is not really a good idea cause your job doesn&#39;t secure your financial needs. The pandemic has really set out business-minded people from the rest that is why I&#39;m so lucky to be among the investors trading with Mrs. Kamilah Thurston as his student it&#39;s been success and happiness since the beginning of my trades

i came here casually but it really inspired me

Operation MBBS heroo️

I m so excited my broken marriage has been restored. &quot;We recently made up, even though it was difficult. It&#39;s been more than a month now, and everything feels like it&#39;s returned to normal. He has begun to treat me better, and it&#39;s  been a healing process for both of us. The night mare that had lasted for almost 2 years before we broke up is finally over. It&#39;s like we fell in love all over again! We &#39;ve both put the past behind us, and are trying  to move forward_ and for the first time in long time, the future look alot brighter.i can&#39;t express in world&#39;s how grateful I am Dr uduebor for revive it&#39;s like we &#39;ve finally rediscovered those things about each other that made us fall in  love in the first place. All of the worry and stress has simply vanished. Thank you Dr uduebor for saving my broken marriage and bringing my husband back to me! &quot;  Me and my husband are living together happily again.  All thanks to Dr uduebor.if you have any problem with hearth issues as well.  Contact (dr.uduebor@gmail.com) or Whatsapp (+2349044159370)..

Amazing. Simply amazing.

Your are adorable

Love the line you said, &quot;Kal toh karna hi hai yaar, why not enjoy the whole process of doing it and reaching your goals&quot;. Really a great and a motivational line you said. Truly you nailed it!

He gives a hint of Ranbir Kapoor when he looks down. But hats off to his journey and I wish the audience was a little more supportive though! I surely got inspired and he is a wayyyy better actor than many other who get the unnecessary limelight.️️️️

You are really an inspirational person Aayush

Yes Aayush... you inspired me

Awesome person yr

Such a positive person you are Whenever I listen to you I would always be like, &quot;Ughh pls dont stop&quot; and , your voice is like a blessing to ones ear.

And about your acting skills!? I dont think  anyone needs to say ANYTHINGG!!! You are unstoppable and I will always pray that you reach wherever you want to be in your career because you deserve every bit of it!The hardwork that you have put in is surely gonna pay off. Much loveee favourite Also this Ted talk had inspired me alot. Tbh I decided to watch this because it was you but then as you kept on narrating your real life incidents I just felt so inspired and whatever you said about rejections are so very true and important. Thank you so much for putting this forward.This is going to help me alot in my laterlife

Nicely conducted and well spoken about the steps involved in achieving life goals He always reminds me of yesteryear evergreen actor Jeetendra.

It&#39;s really inspiring  thankqqqqq so much

Smile smile and only smile ...hahaha

People face rejection only and only when s/he started something new which is not done by her/his family members. Nepotism is everywhere not only in film industry but also in govt sector.We, middle class people feel rejection at each &amp; every stage of our life whenever we want to do something new something different from our background.

Wow Break it down ️️️️
Ayush  and  Barkha are my favorite 

Ayush&#39;s mbbs Web series is too good...

You will definitely be a superstar, you are already an inspiring person. love to listen to you. God bless you.

U know when i just see ayush , there is automatically a smile on my face 

U really are inspiring  ayush mehra

Just  two words for you. Thank you Ayush!

Rejections,Auditions are easy for people who are based in Mumbai, Because you have your parents for support, you have your friends for support,you have a house to live in,you have food to eat.But BOOM! That&#39;s not the case if you are from somewhere else...you need to do a job,so that you can feed yourself,have a shelter(with 8 other people),do not have those close friends,nothing !!And finding a job isn&#39;t easy...It&#39;s very tuff very very tuff !!!!P.S. not demotivating,go for it,grab every oppurtuinity,you will only feel success if you will go through this..&lt;3

Everybody needs to listen to that line at <a href="">11:30</a>. So motivating.

Lafanga...️️️️️
