aaand he was actually right,... the website is offline LOL

<a href="">2:20</a> idk why but this cracked me up so much. RICH CARS, EXPENSIVE! Maybe he meant: expensive cars, rich? 

Jake Paul is actually trying to help people. What are you doing to help people and your fans out Pewdiepie?

a good random algorithm and random recommendation...revisiting old vids

Dude student loans are fucked in the US

Student loan debt is a whole different ball park in america though.

I really didnt believe in the movement until he said Lenny&#39;s Pizza, now im truly with the movement

H8er

FFM was literally a hustlers university before it happend

Watched this video like 10 times. I love when good people troll back to expose criminals. &lt;3

Its a tradition to go back here every once in a year

Wow Pews predictions aged really well, the website doesn’t exist anymore!

Its so funny that the site is really down now 

The hate for jake paul from pewdiepie is real 

Yes the same generation that created a sexuality based on their favourite youtuber is smarter than other generations.

Female. Female. Male porn hahahaha ffm

Lol I&#39;m surprised u werent taken to porn results .... Ffm 

feel like the problem was that jake had learning difficulties or just laziness in school

This guy use pads for training me : wooden boards and concrete ground Tate use woodJake is cheesy

those kids are ruined if they follow his advice 

<a href="">8:08</a>Coffeezilla was here all this time.

What is the update about this movement?

Student loan is one of the cheapest loans - a Swedish man

Jake would probably climb over a glass wall to see what is on the other side

<a href="">5:15</a>

All that money and you can&#39;t even be bothered to hook up a PA for your own event?? Bruh.

He&#39;s trying to be Andrew tate and break the matrixs

I cant believe that Jake´s scam is more professional than Tate´s scam.

This was the demo for Andrew tate

Jake Paul is the definition of 1IQ

I would pay a million$ to knock out pewdie pie and see how he trash talk after that

Hi, my name is Jake Paul and im the dumbest piece of shit.

I think the student loans in Sweden are different than america.

The first person I would trust my finances is Jake Paul

Bless pewdiepie for cleaning up youtube of such filth

anyone who does the lego ninjago kai thing on there eye brow isn’t a very intelligent person

this is the video i keep coming back to, i love it, all hail dan fleyshman

<a href="">8:08</a> BEND OVER

I love how everyone rn loves this guy. Did everyone forget about the multiple scams Jake was responsible of? I take pride in never supporting Jake Paul lol

he just moistened his lips felix, calm down haha, he&#39;d been talking for a long time.

Step one to financial freedom: scam young uneducated people.

If he’s a smart one in the school Jake Paul. Why don’t we just Google him. From his name and school and see what pops up. Questions comments ideas thoughts. Stay safe stay away from scammers. Reporting to authorities. And shut the scammers down.

student loans in US are a problem but that&#39;s because college is just too expensive ...

how to become a worldwide known influencer:



1. be the brother of a worldwide known influencer.



That&#39;s it.

I don’t disagree with the message that a lot of what school teaches is pointless, but he turned it into this whole ego trip about praising himself for being kind of a messiah.  Totally strays from the point he’s trying to make.

I know this is old but why does Jake Paul act like economics isn’t a class you take in high school

Pewdiepies parents are Richie rich rich. He was too proud to ask money from them, he used to eat Marconi cooked plain.

very wrong about the    Student loan thing  homie ....   Anyone that went to school, and took out &quot;legit&quot;  loans   and are late 20s early 30s+  with high paying jobs  haven&#39;t even paid back the principal because of all the Interest accrued

Arvid Assburg
I&#39;m not a fan of him but he made well over 40 million last year lol. That&#39;s more than you and literally everyone on these comments combined lol

I just watch this every year brothers

gotta love how he named himself arvid assburg LMAO

I appreciate going to school more now, thank u jp morgon

this is the reason why i continue to watch pewds.he always debunk all nonsense that most idiotfluencers throw out there

I literally watch jake paul videos on other youtubers so that I can hate him without helping him make money. Watching him is like asmr but instead of feeling relax, you feel cringe.

Damn the thumbnail

Hahahahhahaha

Yes, I want financial advice from someone who never finished high school. I want him to tell me that my college degree is worthless and that my student loans (which I&#39;ve paid off) are ruining my life. Personally I would rather work a regular job than exploit children for money.

Woah, you guys complain about paying TAXES? Don&#39;t worry, if we don&#39;t get our caps in time, we will send out a collection team... and we will get our caps...

How is Jake Paul supposed to learn how to read good when he can&#39;t even fit inside the building??!!

&quot;Who this is NOT for: People who believe that education requires massive debt and countless years of outdated education taught by people who don&#39;t have the results you want(aka the standard education system today)&quot; Years later and he&#39;s STILL dissing teachers. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I agree that our education system is bad and it could use a lot of improvement but basically saying &quot;if you want to be successful, don&#39;t go to school they got nothing for you&quot; is just...woooooow

pewdiepie funny asl
Just wait for him to suddenly buy something expensive after that

I want Jake Paul to advertise all the bad things, as they have the exact opposite effect

We need the yearly update 

my nigga &quot;they&quot; are the haters

We live in a aociety
Engagement

How would they think we can have less that 1% of people making money whit internet if there would not be 99% of people cabble to pay to them.

McGregor would have shown him in one punch

You can now get a lifetime membership for $20 lol....all the suckers who paid that per month.

Are u with me he wanna mess al of us with his bad hobby n profession

The lip thing that jake paul did at the end of the first video, when felix reenacted that, that got me  <a href="">2:36</a>

Pewdiepie: What MrABroad doing? Me: Just created new song for all youtubers. This song is a must to hear. 

well another scam by Jake and no cops... shocked ;\

<a href="">1:45</a> Well, not in US ,in US companies hound you for it and trick you into paying more and more and goverment sits there and watches you burn because both Reps and Dems are paid by these companies.Not a Jake Paul fan tho.

Because of jake, I’ll become a doctor without even needing to go to school

Lmaoo this video, reactions are on point haha

Pewdiepie,can you attend online English classes?  Professor Pie

the 12k people who unliked this are probably jake&#39;s fans LMFAO

swedish tuition must be a lot cheaper than us tuition.  you&#39;ll get that paid back in a few decades.

i dont like jake paul

jake is so roasted

You know if historical figures like Napoleon, Caesar and Khan saw Jake, he would be executed in seconds

Thumbnaio got me 
why i have watched this video 3 times

Imagine all the kids going up to their parents asking for money to join this jake paul movement. Imagine the kids explaining this to their parents and imagine what the parent must be thinking about this whole thing 

Aylmfao

I mean, aside from this stupid FFM scam, I think your take on student loans is based on your experience in Europe (I know that&#39;s pretty obvious) that you may think they&#39;re pretty fair, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same for the USA. Maybe the system is similar, even the amount of money, but the economical and political contex weighs a lot too in this kind of matter.

They hid the subscriber amount from their YouTube channel

I don&#39;t watch a lot of long videos but man PewDiePie does a great job of keeping me captivated. Real OG of youtube!

Monthly access 40$ (50% off)Yearly access 480$ (70% off)Last I checked, 12 months in a year12 X 40 = 480So, yearly regular price is more expensive then 12 monthly ones...That&#39;s not how business works in the real world.

<a href="">3:08</a> &quot;maybe if you stayed in school, you would know what a dozen is&quot; LMAO

Every time I feel I lagged in life I watch jake&#39;s financial movement

Anyone got that Ed Sheeran ad?

Pewdiepie talking about student loans are the most affordable loans ....... ok swede

Somebody fcking kill me

&quot;student loans are one of the most fair loans you can get&quot;

If your gonna write a whole ass paragraph dissing the education system, you might want to be grammatically correct

And I am very passionate about Jake&#39;s mom

Udemy is cheaper wtf

Arvid Assberg gets me everytime.
Jake actually motivated me to try in school and not listen to his bs

Why does everyone talk shit about 9 to 5 jobs? I worked a 9 to 5 job for 2.5 years as a computer technician before I started going to University to study Cyber Security and it was some of the most rewarding and enriching work I’ve ever had and I while I have to move on to bigger and better things, I never felt like it was a slog. If you really enjoy your work then it barely feels like work. Do what you love and the money will come.

Like Bend over  !!

If there’s a book about “50 reasons you should stay at school”, they should just take a picture of JP.”

&quot;Money goes to the one who knows&quot;&quot;Money flows to financially educated people&quot;Pewds, I&#39;m gonna figure out the best way to take advantage of Student loan

The thumbnail makes me hate him even more

Student loans are not great in the US

“I&#39;m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ”
It was funny how he named his account Arvind Assburg lol

Everyone has 9-5 jobs I have 7am-12am everyday

Viva Pewdiepie. You&#39;re literally the smartest realest guy on youtube and I don&#39;t give a shit about gaming I like you for your personality and how much you humble you are and sense of humour and also your sweet wife, I&#39;m a proud  French-Algerian fan🇨🇵🇩🇿 everybody loves you in both of my countries.

Arvid Assburg
You shuld box jake paul and talk later

hows this generation smarter? They&#39;re filing ther teeth on tiktok right now XD

Posted on my birthday

At the end of the day ...... he’s rich.

Deez Nutz
Jake justs increased my cringe level 200 hundred percent

nobody&#39;s gonna talk about BEN DOVER ? Bendover i mean !

its financial freedom for a second

i dont want to be mentored with these guys

Imagine listening to Jake (Buy My Merch) Paul on how to get financial freedom

who retires at 65 wtf?I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t

9 to 5 is better than 24/7 thinking bout money

Jake Paul disses an education he never even completed. Most kids are irresponsible and carefree and don&#39;t want to work. It doesn&#39;t mean school is pointless. Jakes such an idiot

TROUBLE

Moral of the story: If you don&#39;t study, you become like Jake Paul?

Jake Paul is now a boxer... I guess the movement failed, again! Maybe he&#39;ll re-brand it and try again

Why are we sitting in a history class if our teachers haven&#39;t even discovered America and participated in the world war?

gamer

<a href="">2:13</a>

Dozen
I just simply love you!!!

<a href="">2:40</a> little bit weird

Student loans are horrible in America. School is over priced

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine being a human and having so much hatred&quot;

That site is closer to a pyramid scheme than a help to society.

Who else giggled at Ben Dover?

Some of us just don&#39;t have the personality disorder to tweet elite martial artists, gaslighting them into making millions.

<b>Billy gene is not my lover...</b>It&#39;s Billie Eilish

The financial freedom movement YouTube channel has their subscriber count hidden lmao

His website is still up by the way. If you search it up the first thing you see is an &#39;Interactive Experience&#39; where you choose between Jake Paul and three of his friends to drink toilet water.

as if jake would have paid any more attention in class if they talked about practical every day economicswe&#39;re talking about a spoiled kid who has never been through any trouble in life and whose existence has been somehow blessed with enormous luck, resulting in a soulless superficial personality that won&#39;t care about any thing apart from his bank account and his drip

<a href="">13:55</a> is the best way to describe &quot;Jake Paul&quot; i 100% agree

<a href="">5:00</a> Can&#39;t believe it, he&#39;s litterally explaining that artists should accept to be paid in exposure.

U trash talking Jp made my day lmao

Learn for me and go back to school idiots

Wtf I cringed so much thx pewds dis is awesome

Jake - maybe some of you are too young to know thisWas that a self confession that his audience is kids

Jake paul is upto fight ksi

‘Legitimate people talk about this’ 1 minute later Jake’s pulls up experts 

Jake Paul made me not gay

jake is so cringe

Title:what is Jake Paul up to?Me:sees another video but thumbnail is Jake Paul face being cancelled

I&#39;d bet that the experts that are on this website went to school

2:7

Yeet

<b>Sigh.</b>Stay in school, kids.

️  DAMN RIGHT , NIKO IS WAY BETTER THRAN JAKE AND LOGAN PAUL. 
Jake Paul vs PewDie next boxing match lol
You are so funny

Imagine you sitting in the class, drawing random things on your book and thinking i am smartest kid in the class, i dont need this school, i am better than this. this teacher can teach me somthing? Nah, i bet im now smarter than him.

Bro student loan in my uni is fuking something else

just to clear up the first black expensive car in jake promotion video is not his car its fr a man called many khoshpen

Just got a Jake Paul Boxing Add before this video

<a href="">9:37</a> omg I can’t when I saw bts pop up randomly 

So y&#39;all just decided to ignore the dude named Ben Dover? 

Isn’t there a class called career readiness?

Good ole BenD over peeping in the comments

He can barely string a sentence together

&quot;I was the smartest kid in class&quot;<b>England is my city</b>

Thanks for rosting that sh**t

I have more subscribers then them

I just love how Pewds takes pleasure in roasting JakeAnd I feed off it.

Damn it&#39;s been a year already. Somehow this was the most boring year of my life but at the same time the one that went by the fastest

Jp its actually a disease that even the disease community don&#39;t want to acknowledge him.

9 to 5 jobs he is complaining about my mom works from 6am to 8pm

Your giving him clout

why is the history teacher teaching us about presidents if he was never a president

With that 70’s porn music in the background of LP’s 2nd video

PEWDIEPIE, BEN ASKREN IS CALLING YOU FOR A LAST ROAST TO JAKE PAUL

&quot;Ben Dover&quot; more like &quot;Bend Over&quot;

anyone watching this after he got pie faced at the press conference by askren?It would have been funny fuck if after he face timed masvidal, askren facetimed pewdie who has 4x the subscriptions

Pewdiepie
And you’re right there is lots of people that are inspiring.. such as you? Presidepie?

FFM is literally a scam. A waste of money and time

In my school, we had maths and economics. So we learned the quadratic formula (I didn&#39;t take maths so IDK if that&#39;s a real thing) and we learned about taxes, insurance, loans, and investing. You can have both in a regular high school education. I don&#39;t get his problem.

is the site still updating? YT channel is dead btw.

&quot;Ben Dover&quot;
Jake: &quot;there are a lot of people on student loan right now...&quot; Sounds like an American problem to me.

Jake guru gives gurus nightmare...
Jake Paul motivated me to never ever have children that drop out of nursery (kindengarten)

Shouldnt the captions just be for highlights? Why did he caption every single word?

&quot;maybe if you stayed in school, jake, you would know what a dozen is... Jesus Christ...&quot;

this was a nice B-Day present... thx Pewds lol

Jake Paul face looks way older than pewds lmao

What can I learn from Jake Paul? He&#39;s stupid.

FYI YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO OUR GENERATION JAKE

yo, who actually dislikes this video? 

That “bruh” sound effect

ARVID ASSBURG

Shut up Pewds. You aren&#39;t funny

bruh my lame minecraft yt channel has more subs the the financial freedom movement lol

Jake Paul is just dumb .
Gotta say the site is build solidI wonder how much Jake Paul squeezed from those sponsers

<a href="">9:20</a> made it look like jake was the &#39;entertainment&#39; at a birthday party or smthn

@PewDiePie sign up, im sure you have 20$ and see what you get and how much of a scam it is? 20 bucks wont hurt you and you have some more cringy content

WHAT THE HYUCK IS STUDENT LOAN???

It&#39;s getting to the point where I struggle to find fan comments on Jake&#39;s videos

Ben Dover? Nah Bend Over
<a href="">4:31</a> thats team 10

I cracked on Billy Gene XD

the first time i came across pewdiepie i was soo confused why a gamer had soo much subs but after watching a few of his reactions to stuff , i get it , its his personality that draws attention , hes a humble genuine fella

Imagine if Jake Paul was smart.  

How can you learn the quadratic equation if your teacher didn&#39;t invent the the formula.

How surprising, a multi-millionaire who doesn&#39;t have a real job and doesn&#39;t understand anything about actually being in debt is shitting on a movement that want to actually help educate kids in finance and expose how fucked up the American education system really is. wtf is your problem pewds

Umm excuse me, he said what to Zayn?! <a href="">0:12</a>

Join our movement or the $1.5 dollar student debt. $1.5 seems fair to avoid JP...

pewds needs to roast jake paul more

I would definitely love an update on how insanely good this movement has been going

I wonder how many content creators forked over 20 bucks to Jake to make fun of his website lol

idk how student loans work in uk but in america they are such bs and can be misunderstood so quickly

Damn this was exactly one year ago..

did i see manny khoshbin p1 <a href="">2:18</a>

Pewdiepie is somebody who acts Dumb but is actually Smart,Jake paul is somebody who acts Smart but actually Dumb.

“Student loans aren’t something to complain about”Sounds about European

Idk if this applies to every school In america but in my school they have financial classes you can take

Fun fact: Jake Paul is racist

If Jake Paul gets into the flight I&#39;m in, I&#39;m gonna get down cause I don&#39;t wanna be in the same level as he is.

Man i am grateful that i meet Pewd channel few years ago instead of JP

This came out on my birthday

He should do an update video on this now

So nice to see Coffeezilla giving exposure to smaller channels like PewDiePie

sell Jake Paul for peanuts

Took me 11 months to realize that they probably just made up their names there..  BILLY GENES?? BEN DOVER??

why is jake paul literly my friend

Let me tell you something something you need in life is you all know it had you all hate it M A T H

I recently did an interest group project for school, and I’m just imagining students in the future having to research a group, and they choose to do their project on Jake Paul’s Financial Freedom Movement. Smh ‍️

The cumbersome currency aerobically paste because lawyer neatly hop times a uneven egypt. sulky, disillusioned crayfish

School is expensive, but. So. So. So. So. So. Necessary. Don&#39;t listen to this walking baby boy. A bully. Plain and simple. Period.

<a href="">0:55</a> did he even attend math classes? 39.99*12=479.88$ which is less than 480

billy gene 

Lol my film teacher made a film tho

I can watch a lifetime long version of this video without getting bored

student loses in America are fucked. there expensive and take most people until there 40 to pay them of

That thumbnail though...

That&#39;s literally communism

It&#39;s really nice that Pewds paused the jake paul video and translated cause it was really necessary!

Jack paul

Imagine putting that you went through a course hosted by Jake Paul on a resume

Best financial advice for college: stop taking useless degrees!

<a href="">9:36</a> ayy i see something 

Who the heck is Jake Paul, seems like a fraudster

<a href="">1:36</a> Not in the USA...

Prince ea is a good inspirational person go to his YouTube channel

Jake paul gave me motivation to go to an asylum begus of listening to his everyday bro song i got mental problems

LMFAO they hiden the 100 subs they have

We really do have a shitty school system here tho

Isn&#39;t there a class for Financially advantages in school. 

the best part is when u go to film school most of the teachers are retired Directors, producers editors and many more sharing what they have learnt.

well...He&#39;s gonna fight Connor McGregor now so...
Update the website is still up some how 

This didn&#39;t age well.

Jake is sure inspiring me to make a movement, a bowel movement.

Why jake Paul dogs are throwing money

<a href="">8:08</a> i like how Pew says &quot;Bend Over&quot;

Fun fact:jake paul is actually dumb

This got recomended

Damn was it really 10 months ago when pewdiepie took his first break.

I can’t stand jake and Logan. Ugh. Two entitled jerks who make $$ off being idiots.

Jake Paul is a new Joseph Stalin what a story mark

11 million people care &quot;what is jake paul up to&quot; god where are we going...

Money laundering scheme possibly?
Expecting a Jake paul roast when he comes back from this break

mad sus
JP is actually looking at a script.

Did anyone notice that the guy asking to stop all the hate was “Ben Dover”?

Jake financial freedom<b>3 second later</b>F*CK KSI

Ben Dover’s account must have been a troll because, Ben-Dover? come on.

Did anyone else notice his username? <a href="">8:41</a>

To all americans out there?? How does the student loan work?? Educate me please.. ️

<a href="">4:35</a> Ofcourse Jake Paul has rituals to summon Cthulhu. How else would you explain how he still has a following? XD

FFW Is basically be taught the right way from someone who dropped out of high school

you see i am learning so if my mum is asking me why u watching pewdiepie and not studying someone come and tell her that now i know that 9 is not a dozen

Jake Paul: &quot;I was the smartest in class&quot;Also Jake Paul: <b>*uses &quot;...&quot; Instead of commas (,), proper grammar, or punctuation. Doesn&#39;t know the difference between &#39;there&#39; and &#39;their&#39;*</b> ️️

lmao isnt ben dover coffezilla..a youtuber who exposes fake scams

Jake is literally the most Ohio person I’ve ever seen (I know he’s from there)

Bro

Getting made fun of by THE biggest Youtuber has to be the single largest L that Jake Paul will ever take, and there isn&#39;t anyway he could ever respond seriously.

Anyone here after he got sued almost 6 times ,and look who’s talking about financial advice.

I suggests he takes a graphic design and branding course or hires a specialist cuz his Windows movie maker clip look like sheise.<a href="">04:31</a> bruh  thats his team 10 squad. Isnt that the fat &quot;litty&quot; UK &quot;rapper&quot; on the right.

bruh.
Student loans in the us is very different than europe.

It&#39;s a scam!

Boo jake

this is probably just one big advert for squarespace knowing JP.

He’s a snake

Pewd&#39;s literally a guy who came from zero to the most handsome face 2020. and he&#39;s never tried to teach any body anythin. jake paul is creating a platform for a bunch of amatures with no success to teach our youngsters. schewpid

Frick ing YouTube keeps doing unskippable ads

I used to do stand up comedy. When i hear “Ideas are shit without execution”I hear alot of retards that dont have that much life experience. I should know im a retard myself.

Either Jake Paul is a being of pure cringiness, or he is a comic genius and we didn&#39;t even realize it yet.

No pay
Pew die pie vs jake paul boxing
Why are we even sitting in math class if Albert Einstein is not even the teacher.

&quot;Billy Gene is not my lover. He&#39;s just a guy who said that I am the one. But the kid is not my son.&quot;Michael Jackson 1987

Jake: They say we are lazy and entitledAlso Jake: We deserve better

There is literally nothing in his movement nothing lol.....  it&#39;s just a big scam , what are they selling, what ? What do you do to live life on our terms , like a business? Art? What?

Why are we living if we don&#39;t know the meaning of life?

do a part to 2020

Why is pewdiepie such a fucking silly for god sake.....

rich cars! love those

everybody who disliked has student loans to pay back

Why are we sitting in math class if the teacher isn&#39;t even a number?

He&#39;s got the &quot;uncle who asks your dad for money&quot; look

Jake Paul thinks you need stock footage for every word you say to prove a point.

<a href="">6:01</a> is thata tatooed child????

.

Why are we sitting in michael jackson class when the teacher isn&#39;t even Billy Gene?

why are we in “math” class when the teacher isn’t Pythagoras himself? makes you think

Ah yes, before the pandemic.

Bruh

Becareful felix or jake will got u, hahahaha

Just a spoilt kid who tries to impress PewDiePie but ends up being dumb and Dumber!!?!

I feel bad for the parents that gota pay for their kids jake Paul subscription

JP: moneys moneys all care aboutalso jp: Less make a website ima SCAM for MONEY.Me: You have been exposed.(this is my opinion that i think jp is doing right now. Im not trying to offend anyone.)Totally funny joke: Hes born on April first! Hes a joke. HAHAHAHAHAHAHH SO FUNNY

I like how they turned off sub count and haven’t uploaded in 9 months

I agree about student loans. People should stop dig piling on the “don’t take a loan you can’t afford” because so many people WANT an education (i.e. kid who wants to be a veterinarian) but you’re telling them that if they can’t afford it, they don’t deserve education. I think some reform is needed on how little people can afford school in some countries, but shitting on people who have debt to STUDY, to better themselves for a better future isn’t helpful. I think it sucks that so many people are in debt for education, but I think people should be aware of how fair and low interest student loans tend to be. And yes, using it correctly is necessary, same with scholarships and any money.

I enrolled my son in FFM and he learned how to scream loudlyAnd make shitty content

Jake Paul: &quot; I was the smartest kid in the classroom&quot;Me: soooo, you were alone all the time?

Guys please stop posting hate comments towards Jake Paul!!!! &gt;:(   I cant like all of the comments :)

Well i am
<a href="">8:18</a> my boy spoctor up here in a pewds video

Why when he speaks his lips don’t move with his words?

The late brandy preferably stir because blizzard rheologically serve atop a talented pair. nondescript, quiet oven

Bruh I wish I had a 9-5 job I do the worst hours and it’s absolutely ruined my social life and I have no energy at all I would sell my souls for a 9-5 job 

wow is someone so dumb to pay money for this &quot;movement&quot;

Mans name was &quot;Ben Dover&quot; XD

When Jake Paul said he was the smartest kid in class was the point where I realized something. If he was the smartest kid in class, why does he make so many dumb choices? And yes Ik this video is roughly 7-8 months old XD

PewDiePie Nice
Why are we watching PewDiePie when he isn&#39;t even die

we did mock taxes and interviews in 12th grade and we even had an apartment living class

Pretty sure he stole that clip of the P1 from a Doug Demuro video

Learn trade guys.
Jake Paul  : &quot;Are you with me?&quot;PewDiePie : &quot;I&#39;m ok, thank you though&quot;

Using big words to wash our sensitive brains is an ancient trick that still works. ;) We need thinking tools and Pewds is giving us that.

Pubes fight jake Paul MR big YouTuber you will get knock out 1st round. By the way MR beast made you

Says the guy who thinks covid 19 is hoax lol

<a href="">9:36</a> NAMJOON OMG

Why are we sitting in cooking class when the teacher isn’t even a peanut

<a href="">1:35</a> Maybe in Europe, but in the U.S. the student loan program tricked the government into allowing it to do whatever it wants, including increasing the interest rate and abolishing a citizen&#39;s right to file for bankruptcy against them.

we need a vid about jake paul boxing

your not wrong but the us student loan is not a super easy nice handout it’s a life sentence for a good portion of the people who do it because even with a diploma you can’t find a job at least not one that uses your degree

Pewds talking about how great student loans are but he doesn&#39;t even live in America

Here’s some popcorn while you scroll and die at the comment section : 
For being one of the “smartest kids in class”, he doesn’t even know how to write a basic sentence.

I love how PewDiePie doesn’t plug his merch every minute.

in-class today, during maths, some kid said, &quot;why the hell do we need to know differential equations? as if I need it to get a Job&quot; the teacher then said. &quot;well I got a job as a teacher from learning differential equations&quot; i can honestly imagine jake paul being the kinda guy who say that.

<a href="">1:36</a> Come to America... you’ll see 

Jake Paul is talking out of his ass. He’s a spoiled rich boy using mommy and daddy’s money. He has no IDEA what “financial freedom “ means for REAL PEOPLE.

<a href="">0:11</a> He literally doesn&#39;t know how to spell Zayn and still tries to play the victim card

Wikipedia&#39;s not showing his education. Anyone knows if Jake Paul has a BA/Master&#39;s degree?

Why are we sitting in history class when the teacher isn’t even Abraham Lincoln???

<a href="">10:52</a> it really sounded like he said &#39;&#39;i put together a movement for <b>dumb</b> people to be able to be a part of&#39;&#39; i know he&#39;s saying <b>young,</b> but it really sounds dumb....i mean, like dumb.

i think i saw a body language expert on tv say that when someone is talking and they push their tongue out like that, its a sign of deception or something.

Who keeps saying &quot;Bruh&quot;? It is funny i am just being curious.

Wait did he say tht guy created WWE?

why am I seeing american pewdiepie here?

Good luck brother.

JP: just pain.

<a href="">12:43</a> Dang Pewd&#39;s first language isn&#39;t even English and he knows better than to use the wrong &quot;their&quot;

Pewds was right jakepaul took down their Shitty website. Finally Inner Peace

This comment section made my life.  I can now happily pass away. Also Pewdiepie when I seen JP do the tongue thing after the ad, and then you did it i was like &quot;STOP&quot; lmao

Websites already down fam

Everyone talking shit about 9-5 but what would we do without barista, chefs, street cleaners, accountants, police... Someone needs to do those jobs and hand you your expensive meal, make your expensive car, maintain YT, FB, IG so you can use them

Why are we sitting here trying to learn programming when the teacher isn&#39;t even a computer?

In america,student loans are a big problem. Like really. They have 1 trillion dollars in student debt. Due to lobbying of the government by these banks.

Everyone&#39;s gonna ignore how pewds username is Arvid Assburg

Pewds face looks full HD. I&#39;m seeing it for the first time.

the fancy car in jakes video is from Manny koshbin! probably he doesnt know his car is in the video

Why are we sitting in math class, if our teachers aren’t even a math equation?

What is Jake Paul up to? FBI comes knocking.

How do you get a degree and it “expires” before you can use it lol, he clearly has never thought about anything besides scamming kids

Yes, the education system is flawed. No, I don&#39;t need to pay for bullshit from Jake Paul.

wow first disney buys fox and now they support jake paul disney has officially gone down hill lol

jake paul is a waste of skin and space.

Smallpp

geez and i thought i hated jake paul before this

lmao pewds roasting jake paul is funny af

jake is doing this shit to stay relevant

Hello bro
you are my ideal can say one line for me PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

U looser

Jake actually helped kids with his movement, he inspired them to go to school and not become assholes.

I love how Felix&#39;s English is better than Jake Paul&#39;s, who speaks English as a first language.

Why do people hate Jake Paul

If you&#39;ve got money to burn, just subscribe to Skillshare or Brilliant or something reputable, they&#39;re actually cheaper than Jake Paul&#39;s ponzi-scheme-type BS lol

Cody Ko: What kids?Jake Paul: l:SilenceJake Paul: You bully kids i don’t like that

the video length is <a href="">14:52</a> if you add the numbers 4+2 and 1+5which equals to 66 .. holy shit right

Hi

jake paul: why am i sitting in class learning about math when i should be learning about finance/economicsdude if you were taking an economics class you&#39;d need to know the quadratic formula lmao

after that i donated -1000 bucks to jake paul

if Jake paul was really smart he would be like LIGHT YAGAMI but he dint die so he continued corrupting this world

Did Anyone else. See his name on ffm it was Arvid Assburg

Friend : Hah, Jake is so dumb. Doesn&#39;t know what a dozen.Me : Do you know what a dozen is?Friend : Ofc, 10!Me : <a href="">3:08</a> great. This is our generation ppl.

Jokes on him, I did learn how to do taxes in school.

Jake Paul(3yrs ago): PewDiePie is nextPewDiePie(3yrs ago): Reacts and disses JakeJake Paul(3yrs ago): Reacts to PewDiePie and puts his full channel name in the title and mentions PewDiePie has 54M subscribersPewDiePie 3 years after that has 107M subscribers and Jake Paul now has 20.3M subscribers as of today. Even Logan passed Jake in those 3 years and now has 2M subscribers more than Jake. Personally, I like PewDiePie and Logan Paul much more than Jake Paul. That&#39;s me. So really, Jake Paul you failed at going after PewDiePie. It&#39;s been 3 years dude. What do you have to say about this? @Jake Paul@PewDiePie@Logan Paul

It kind of sounds like Jake paul heard boyinabands song &quot;don&#39;t stay in school&quot; where Dave talks about rethinking the education system, and then just ran with idea to make money.

<a href="">1:40</a> I think student loans really are pretty shite in the US compared to what we have here in Europe.

He up to yo mama

Me watching a pewdiepie video. Gets an ad for his merch* coincidence? I think not

Just like your game

You Sweden you lose
BTW my dog made my profile pic any of u like it

So bruhing

<a href="">09:36</a> so Pewds enjoys BTS

imagine growing up and finding out you were in a jake paul ad

<a href="">8:09</a> did anyone else notice that him name is literally ben Dover (bend over)

Man this guy is the most trollable person on the internet....the cringe I got watching this is indescribable....

He is a villager

<a href="">7:22</a>     moonwalkers unite
<a href="">1:37</a> In the UK it&#39;s the cheapest loan you can take. Tbf at this point it doesn&#39;t even count as a loan anymore as the repayment works more like a tax than an actual loan. In the US however student loans are an actual nightmare. In the UK loans are given by a governmental association, in the US it&#39;s given by banks. Banks have a higher incentive to monetize on loans as they&#39;re not publicly funded, therefore in the US it is actually a nightmare. Also to go to a good uni in America the tuition fee is ridiculously high. But Yh, don&#39;t take financial advice by the Youtuber that burns stuff in his pool and breaks lockdown to host parties.

jake: r u with me felix: im ok ty thoughme: lol i dont know why this is soo funny to me.

Is this....The god church

Bruh when he said “there” an ad do cyberpunk 2077 and it said rated m

What a coincidence i am currently studying the lesson of quadratic formula in my class and they said the quadratic formula lol

i hate it when people like jake say &quot;quite college, quite school&quot; they say it like youre life will magically change into the better. What do you think theyll do? i bet theyd just sit and play video games all day. Besides, a lot of what you learn in school helps you learn how to think, not just how to use fractions.

The sollution is to remove you jake

English isn’t even Pewdiepie’s first language and he’s correcting Jake ‍️
<b><a href="">4:31</a></b><b> WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?? what is wrong with that guys face?!?</b>  lmaoo so many questions

 <b>lmaoo i absolutely LOVE these thumbnails pewds makes...gold.</b> 

Does Jake Paul not realize those “9 to 5 cookie cutter jobs” are necessary? Where does he think his electricity comes from? Or the mansion I’m sure he has. It’s called hard work.

The messages that Jake Paul is sending out is just so stupid.

If you are go to pay all this money to get a job, just pay for college at that point tbh, you would get way more qualified people and more bang for you buck compared to this shit man tbh

So many of these fucking finance gurus, its so annoying

You&#39;d know how worthless an education system is if you&#39;re in a 3rd world country

Why are we sitting in biology class when the teacher isn&#39;t even a tree?

<a href="">1:36</a> Not in the USA...

&quot;Our generation is better then this, we deserve better where smarter&quot; jake paul says after re-watching his teacher dis track

Even I have more subs than this Ffm crap..

Next Jake Paul Video<b>Pewdiepie is a cyberbully</b>

i thought the thumbnail was his real face LOL

Billy Gene is not my lover!!

I hate you
Pewpiepie

Jake Paul is so dumb

ME ; WHO CARES ABOUT FFM

Hey guys chill everyone makes mistakesJake&#39;s mom made 2.

Why do they teach us science when they aren&#39;t even scientists?

You&#39;re not 65 JAKE! * haha

zayn not wanting to spend time with jake is everything sjsjsj

Douche paul

Jail time Baby!!

This caveman is about as smart as an old banana. Mind you, that banana may have better life skills from just sitting in a fucking bowl for a week.

Why are we sitting in class learning about &quot;math&quot; when the teacher isn&#39;t even a number?

School loans are cost full

When comment section roasts jake Paul better than pewds

We just gonna ignore the guy who is literally named billy gene

It’s the YouTube version of Ponzi schemes

That part about student loan is a little... ProblematicOther than that, you go Pewds

Who’s here looking for Jake Paul’s comeback comment.

JAKE PAUL IS SO UGLY YOU LOOK REALLY COOL OK

Your so funny Iam litterly dying

Even if Pewds roasts Jake Paul and Jake Paul aint clapping back just proves he&#39;s afraid of pewds

millionaires throwing 1 dollar bills on all the screaming kids.

Billy Gene is not my lover

<a href="">2:37</a>i watched too much of Mister Maker as a kid

Why are we sitting in IT skills class at school when the teacher isn&#39;t even Bill Gates

All the eight year olds wanting financial freedom LOL

jake has a bigger nose

YIU COULD STOP TALKING  CRAP ABOUT HIM CAUSE HE WILL BEAT U UP SO BAD

I am in no way trying to defend Jake Paul or attack PewDiePie but I disagree with PewDiePie on one thing; student loans actually can give you really bad debt and I don’t think student loans are a good idea just go to a cheaper college

Holy balls, Jake Paul is such ceiling gang

Guys we should promote kindness in the comments...we&#39;ve roasted Jake a lot now let&#39;s say something positive about him. ill start...Well for one, Jake is....Jake.....I mean he&#39;s a.....<b>Well, shit this is hard</b>

I like how he&#39;s trying to advertise financial freedom to his followers who were grinding in kindergarten

PewDiePie has probably never taken student loans in America.

Don&#39;t troll JakeI can&#39;t like all the comments.

<a href="">2:00</a> jake paul : we are smarter         all the generation : no we are smart not u

&quot;What is he up to, that little snek&quot;(Spoiler alert)Milord, he is in pris&#39;n.

Your take on student loans is 100% wrong, unfortunately.

Jake Paul: Financial Freedom. Are you with me?<b>2 months later</b>News: Jake Paul filmed looting, but denies being a part of it.

I know I&#39;m a little late to the party, but here in America, student loans are absolutely NOT the best loan available. You should do everything possible to avoid taking out a student loan, especially from a companies like Sallie May.

The video aged, just forwards

<a href="">6:35</a> 70% off $480 is $144...couldn&#39;t he have just put $499 instead of $480?!! dumbass Jake Paul

you actually got this right pewdiepie .. just summarized it said what we all thought about, they&#39;re bunch of nobodies scammers ... i heard he went to jail thu ...

Wow all I can say is fuckin wow! Jp is a genius LMFAO

The internet will rejoice once Jake Paul&#39;s YT channel gets deleted or banned.I can&#39;t w8.

Damn, I’m glad Jake Paul went to MrBeast’s house. ”Subscribe to PewDiePie”, MrBeast said, lo and behold what a feast of roasting here I found.‍️

Are u with me? 

<a href="">9:36</a> i love how you tube suggested him a bts video... i wish he would do another coming out story :(

<a href="">2:18</a> , Those are Manny Khoshbin&#39;s Mclaren P1 and Mclaren Senna, and I bet Jake stole that footage.

JAKE PAUL AS IN FAKE MAUL

Damn he really did enroll himself..... Waau the dedication I --

People like Jake Paul basically think that teachers have to be your parents.

&quot;maybe if you stayed in school jake you&#39;d know what a dozen is&quot;

what aC L O W N

I understand Pewds but I&#39;d have to disagree on student loans, they&#39;re government controlled so you don&#39;t have options on rates, plus the rates are some of the worst out of any loans in the u.s. He is a swed boy so he might not know about that.

When jake said, “bdhehendhdoalwkp.” I was touch

Pewdiepie is wrong about Student Loans, but then again he is from Sweden where Post ED is much more affordable. The US system is different.

<a href="">10:00</a> is jake forming a cult  
Can you please make another video about this ?

&quot;Billy Gene&quot; inspired from Michael Jacksons Billie Jean?

Jake Paul is like a cartoon personification of the worst of US tween pop culture. He actually had too much affirmation.

Jake Paul just gave me motivation to go to school.

Jake Paul asking us if we&#39;re joining him or not while flirting with the viewers is something I didn&#39;t know we needed........

the FBI apparently

This aged well.

&quot;Our generation is better than this&quot;Uh— sir I cant do my taxes

Who’s here after fbi raided his house

Cody ko: <b>fake insulting jake</b>Jake: <b>yelling at him like a baby</b>Meanwhile...PewDiePie: <b>actually insulting him</b>Jake Paul: “see now that’s different”

Has this aged well?

Just getting raided by FBI..!

I’ve made $36,000 with $3,000 investment, because I had good guidance with @Carlos_1uptrades on IG. with his teachings and trading skills, I’ve had nothing but continued success indeed  it’s beyond eye opening

Felix went to school in Sweden so I don’t think the student loans are as bad as in the US

<a href="">2:37</a> the sound is cream dropping from cake game in purble palace  :D

up to no good

I saw this on dangelos channel and it&#39;s still as funny

lazarbeam is better

I wish jake paul have ligma

Jake Paul lucked out and got rich from doing dumb shit for views while his manager and accountant manage his financial information. I think we all know Jake Paul is 47/46 chromosomes when it comes to numbers and not wasting money on 10 grand shoes and Lamborghinis

Literally profiting on telling kids school is bad.

Why are we waiting for our lunch in the que if the dinner lady isn’t Nick Crompton?

Why are we sitting in gym class when the teacher isn’t even Micheal Jordan?

Why are we even learning capitalism when teacher isn&#39;t even George Washington

That thumbnail looks like the love child of Jake Paul and Sir Stevo Timothy! 

If school is so useless then where did the experts on their team get their education?

Jake kinda looks like an off brand rat from flushed away

I like how that cringe pauler says &quot;Fuck Ksi&quot; in front of kids lmao.

Lol, that&#39;s coffeezilla at <a href="">8:07</a>

Jake Paul&#39;s talking about how you don&#39;t need to go to college or high school but didn&#39;t all the experts probably go to college to get a degree in economics or business or marketing

Bro we are forced to take one year of finance courses in high school like dude you saved it for senior year and then dropped out without taking it

Who else got ocd when they were throwing money off the ledge and one got stuck in the crack on the ledge?

Jake Paul = scammer

For some reason I thought Drew Gooden made this video

Felix hates drama Also Felix........

Wow jake barely sounds like a toddler learning how to talk here

Hey pewds , after corona u should colab w mr beast

I think u can learn in jake paul yt channel is all sexuality

Screw you.

Take it out of your list of roasting Jake Paul cause he is ROASTED.

I’m from Britain so I’m just like don’t live in shitty shooting range America

Jake is a wannabe prince ea

It&#39;s ironic that the one person who lucked into fame and wealth by the popularity of his brother and everyone else around him is also the person trying to educate people on becoming successful by themselves.

A good rule for choosing your degree is that the cost does not exceed your starting salary. So if you&#39;re gonna make $50,000/yr your first year out of school, your degree should be less than that.

in america student loans are a lot different

i am not joking i thought the thumbnail was <b>logan</b> cuz of how big the nose was-

Hm yes I want life advice from someone who dropped out of high school

Why are learning about history when the teacher isn’t the every person to ever exist

jake pool

now arent i late

Why is Logan Paul yelling about education when he doesn&#39;t have one?

Why are we learnng History when the teacher isn&#39;t even the first american president? Jeorgen Hoofington.

Why are we in a class learning about reading, when our teacher isn’t a book

I think it would be hilarious if Pewds would sign up for the financial freedom course, and record the calls for videos, that&#39;d be amazing

our generation now: civil war time
On the channel, they turned off comments, likes and dislikes, and the amount of subs.

Heh, just saw a GFUEL X pewdiepie Ad.

What is Jake Paul up to?Idk that’s why I watch you ️

So I guess Jake made it out of this squeaky clean, haven&#39;t seen any news about this in a while.

Lol financial freedom starts with a personal budget not a movement

His face in the thumbnail 

Why are we sitting in math class when the teacher isn’t even a calculator?

Kinda sad to watch

Hi

Uploaded On My B-Day 
Idk about other countries but the US education system is pretty bad in a lot of ways but the last thing we need is Jake Paul making the issue a joke

I love pewdiepie roasting Dr Phil guests and Jake Paul

The Paul brothers are definitely growing differently. Logan has been a lot more mature in the past few months and i admire that very much. On the other hand, jake is still a big pillock.

Why we sittin’ in class learning about “space” when the teacher isn’t a planet

I’m ok, thank you.

&quot;student loans are one of the most fairest loans you can get&quot;Are you f*cking kidding me?? The interest rate is 11%

Why do we even get scammed when the scammer is not Jake Paul?

He hasn’t changed worth sh*t if your asking me

Personal training by Nick Cropmton

Felix, American student loans are a lot heavier than European ones

According to the latest news, he&#39;s up to looting in Arizona.

<a href="">4:34</a> is that Michael jackson???

Jake Paul is smart because he knows big words like “animosity”

now he just raiding stores

I like all the stock footage thrown in  it reminds me of Jordan Belfort at the end of the wolf of wall street 

Just visited the site. They removed all affiliates - i&#39;m a bit surprised actually.. Thought for sure, that Disney was working with him.. Guess not

Jake Paul followers already have financial freedom

He&#39;s like eddy from ed edd n eddy

Jake paul talks about education. He didn&#39;t go to college

I literally took a financial class

Why are kids learning how to read in class when the teacher isn&#39;t even a book?!

Well now we  now where jake gets all his &quot;yes men&quot; from they used this clearly legit

Jake Paul eboy confirmed!!!!

We aren’t sitting in class right now because of the pandemic lol

god I can&#39;t stand entrepreneurs. I just want to beat them to death when they use buzzwords like, &quot;motivate, hustle, take advantage of, just gotta do it, don&#39;t let, 9 to 5.&quot; Entrepreneurs will never understand the satisfaction of starting in the work force, and slowly moving up and having a secure job with a company that pays its worker to be there, have benefits and vacation. Everything they do is a huge fucking scam and 99/100 times they just get lucky and happen to score and feel like it can be repeated. Just because they&#39;re rich now doesn&#39;t meant they <i>made</i> that happen. They just <i>happened</i> to fall in that situation.EDIT: You will never make millions or even 6 digits as an entrepreneur. Odds are, you won&#39;t even break $35k/yr. Its a bullshit business

(^u^)

Why are we learning about math if the teacher isnt even a calculator?!

Jake Paul is Billy McFarland but worse and somehow is able to get a pass every time he scams

Why are we learning about the weather if the teacher isn&#39;t Benjamin Franklin

Jake Paul: Why are we learning about giving birth if the teacher isn&#39;t even a baby?

Uh... jail
I rather have melonpan invest my tax money than hear financial advice from jake

&quot;This is a movement&quot; -&gt; Instantly inserts Ninja:&quot;I don&#39;t see enough movement!&quot;

Jake Paul is a millionaire

How exactly is one going to understand taxes &amp; insurance without the quadratic formula? xD

Billy Gene is not my lover

Billy Gene? Ben Dover? Are they serious?Where&#39;s Mike Litoris?

Ben Dover,lol.    Bend over, lol

You are so fucking funny.

3 months later and now he&#39;s been criminally charged 

How stoked were you that your video was one pixel line from the edge? And then how bummed were you when you noticed the bottom was 2 pixel lines away? The universe finds ways to fuck with us Pew.

<b>THIS VIDEO AGED LIKE WINE</b>

Going to jail.

Don’t get a job, that’s what your parents wantBe homeless, like your terms

Why are we sitting in class learning &quot;dicescting a frog&quot; if the teacher isnt even a frog!?

I heard something about Jake Paul puplic execution

I wonder if the “experts” went to college?

ah yes, i wanted financial freedom from someone who quit school

Whats jake Paul up to<b>trying not to drop the soap in prison next to 6ix9ine</b>

That&#39;s literally a pyramid scheme that&#39;s like you pay a &quot;small&quot; price of $100 and you turn that in to $1000 that&#39;s stupid.

How come we are sitting in class learning about Math when we have calculators on our phones?

How come we are sitting in Gym class and the teachers name is Frank?

How come we are in class learning about history when the teacher is a woman?

Jake Paul and Tai Lopez should team up!

Jake Paul: “i don’t agree with the education system”.....                        State of Arizona: “You’re under arrest for criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly”....

Jake Paul: Are you with me?Felix: <b>Im ok thank you though</b>Me: <b>Dies of laughter</b>

I think Jake Paul  forgot that people need to do those jobs to keep the world working

Jail.

I mean, I went to college and I got a degree and I work in Switzerland. I have two kids and a wife, so I&#39;d say that going to college and getting a job is working out pretty well for me.

How did people fall for his scam

@jakepaule and his channel is ded

LOOTING THATS WHAT HES UPTO

I know what FFM Stands for now. Freaked Financial Movement.

<b>He’s up in jail</b>

Isn’t it illegal to falsely market something and make people pay for it and not follow up on it

if pewds joined this just to make fun of the rituals and secret formula, then Jake would be bragging that they got Pewdiepie to join

Me: Looks at some of Pewds videos&#39; from a couple months agoPewds: What is Jake Paul up to?Me Again: I think I heard something about him a few days agoMe After checking sources: A R R E S T E :Dbottom text

It hurts when i laugh seriously, damnit

Damn you pewds, i cant able to laugh, cause something is wrong with my health, but damn you, for making me laugh

This video makes me want to subscribe

The thing that gets me is he&#39;s saying his generation is smarter.So far we&#39;ve seen people telling others to stop getting vaccinated,we&#39;ve seen people talk about the dangers of eating meat,we&#39;ve also seen people in his generation decide they shouldn&#39;t vote for people just because they are white straight and male.Not looking too smart there Jake. Might wanna reconsider what you&#39;re saying.

not at pewdiepie having bts recommended-

God's saying
<a href="">7:02</a> get exposed jake Paul

Ok.... So here&#39;s the thing according to Jake Paul everyone is just supposed to drop out of schools and just be an influencer but what I don&#39;t get it is if everyone is an influencer who the fuck is going around watching these influencers. To become an influencer you need an audience and you won&#39;t have one if everyone is going around making their own content.

jake pauls generation is boomers
Why are kids sitting in class learning about life cycles when the teacher isn’t even giving birth in front of them?

May 2020: jake  (a multi millionaire) is now looting

Arvid Assburg
Jake was crying when this vid came out

Who came here after the looting video that gone viral?

<a href="">8:13</a>Are we seriously gonna ignore this ? How did felix not meme about it Bendovaaaa

Hii like all your vids :&gt;

Why are we studying &quot;suicide&quot; when the teacher didn&#39;t even commit suicide?

Why do we study in a &quot;sex school&quot; when the teacher doesn&#39;t even have sex in the class?

Why would we join &quot;9 year old army&quot; if PewDiePie isn&#39;t even a 9 year old?

Why are we sitting in a &quot;bio&quot; class when the teacher isn&#39;t even a biographer?

Why are we in an &quot;astronomy&quot; class when the teacher isn&#39;t even an astronaut?

shutup pie

BEN DOVER his parents are weird

What is Jake Paul really up to: LOOTING!

good news. cops can now arrest him under suspicion. entitled white youtuber needs jail time. ridiculous

Wouldnt be surpised if jake paul copyright strikes this video to hide the fact that he actually <b>will</b> take down the website after getting enough money from scamming others.

all he cares about is fame and money, nothing else

Jake Paul stole iPhones and sold them in highschool... Don&#39;t think he&#39;s changed that much, guys a dirtbag

A youtuber is a real job. All YouTubers have an IQ except for the Paul Brothers

What’s jake doing these days? Looting

Wow

the cringe xD

hey guys quit trying to work to get to college and work on giving me money cuz ya know that helps your life 10 folds think about how much that will impact your life

Came back here after Graham exposed the scam of Jake Paul

Why

<a href="">6:50</a> at the top is that meant to say &quot;branding with jak&quot; or jake

Jake Paul is a moron you can see it in his eyes

the funny thing that jake paul never went to collage

He makes good points American schools are so messed up the teach you how to how to meat dead line and be a worker drone

The brah sound gets me every time maaan

sry

Well Jake, there are people who pay their taxes by having a career. You get a career studying subjects in school that, well, some people aren’t going to use but others in the class will, and also, that film teacher didn’t make a film but knows how to create a film but just decided to teach people about how to, just because he hasn’t made a film doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to.Smh I’m 14 years old and know better than Jake Paul, I’m not even American and know how to speak better than him, like seriously Jake you shouldn’t had dropped out of school, kids in the future will know how to criticize you because they did finish their education.

Pewdiepie and ksi roast jake <b>good content</b>

All the dislikers are jakepulars

this is like when nikita opened up her 3 product store xd

Look at the 12k dislike in this video those are the kids join the ffm shit

Hey I eat food too why cant i be on the top list 

And fleshman 
it&#39;s funny that the name &quot;ben dover&quot; actually sounds like&quot;bend over&quot;

You can spot an SJW by watching the hands. They can not express themselves without their hands going crazy.

how isnt this a pyramid scheme?

I (don&#39;t) appreciate the offer, but I&#39;m not interested
