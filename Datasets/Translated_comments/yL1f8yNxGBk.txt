<a href="">1:42</a> &quot;TAMA NA&quot; hahhahaha

I thought a 2 was already made lol

I have watched this movie, omg masterpiece, we need maleficent 3 soon

AURORA IS THA CAUE OF ALL DEATH HERE. SHE IS THE MODERN YOUNGSTER WHO IS STUBBORN WHO DOESNT LISTEN THE ONE WHO RAISED HER. SELFISH BEING UNTIL THE END!!!

Whats the name of the song playing background

She wasn’t really evil . Watch the series its really interesting and she wasn’t evil

just finished watching again, best movie ever, very awarness giving that humans should evolve towards being &quot;angels&quot; and live with contact with nature, by &quot;building&quot; the nature, not vice versa.

Malefecent mistress of evil

Ellen fannig looks like candy candy because she is blonde and has pretty freckles
aurora is a giant pain in the ass

Woke bs

No one ever talks about the amazing lighting in these movies. In dark scenes you can actually SEE what&#39;s going on without jacking up the brightness and burning your retinas. Also, AJ and MP are a joy to watch.

I was watching the RAZZLE commentary when I remembered this thing that didn&#39;t happen

Aight. So this movie is actually really decent. However don’t make a movie where the main character/ anti-hero the actual hero then name it mistress of evil. She doesn’t actually do anything evil in this movie. They should or just put this title for the first one then just call this one maleficent 2???

I wish Maleficent had a 3rd Movie but instead of it being all about Aurora and Philip (except for the 1st movie), I want it to be about Borra and Maleficent. In the first movie, I shipped Maleficent with Diaval but I think Diaval is more of Maleficent&#39;s most trusted friend and I think Borra suits Maleficent more than Diaval, no offense.

Maleficent Mistress of Evil Staring Angelina Jolie Michael Pfeiffer Ellen Fanning is One Of The Most Greatest iconic films ever made in historyMaleficent Mistress of Evil ❤️👋

Wthhhhh......there is a Maleficent 2 ????😳😳........gonna watch this right away😎😎

Aurora got me so pissed in this movie cus the queen could&#39;ve died earlier without her being a phoenix is she didn&#39;t stopped her ....but it was one of my fave movies ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I watched Maleficent and Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil. Honestly, I loved them both. But I wished there could be a third movie where it focuses on Maleficent&#39;s individuality instead of focusing on Aurora all the time. Maybe it could focus on her past, especially her extinct race, and maybe her &quot;true love&quot;.

Mf Arora I really hate this kind of character.

Lady Gaga and save our Presidencies! Trump Angel came to save our lotten agency of country. Its a blessing for technology to assist us!!

Moral of the story is a spoiled brat (Aurora) still got what she wanted after all the fighting.

Angelina Jolie was born for this role🤤

One of the best trailers in the universe

I hate you f*<b>***</b> bitch Aurora
Do you know everyone Aurora is the disgusting f*<b>***</b> vilan in this movie I hate this movie because she look so innocent but inside of her she&#39;s bitch a greddy woman I mean how could she forget maleficent love, kindness all these years she&#39;s been raising and how did she pay for that not trusting her godmother not damn one minute f*** her literally this is 21centuries and you still believe that you can forgive you someone who hurt you the most I mean maleficent almost died for her I can&#39;t believe this is one of the shitty movie I&#39;ve ever watch and it because of that aurora bitch Disney come on I know you love fantasy but this is too much when it comes to human faith

When all the beat started comming in at the same time I was like: awwww sh**

They should make a another Maleficent Movie

Walt Disney is spinning in his grave. These remakes need to stop right now. Can this company be creative again? Hate both Maleficent movies with passion, they are shame for the classic from 1959.

She looks so good when her hair is out after being wounded!!!!!! IM IN LOVE❤️

This is clever, they set up the storytelling of the trailer to present the story as the queen would have told it, where maleficent is the villain, and is just evil.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s called Mistress of Evil because Maleficent becomes evil, but actually, I think it&#39;s the opposite.  To be master over something (or mistress , in this case) means to have power over it.  So I think it&#39;s called that because this is the movie where she finally overcomes evil permanently, freeing herself from it&#39;s bonds.  Because that is what it TRULY means to be the Mistress of Evil.

this is real?

Best movie

since these movies i rly have the BIGGEST crush on angelina 😭

Every time I think I can’t possibly get any gayer an intimidating, pretty, and tall lady proves me wrong.

True

Disney made 3 big mistakes:Anne Hathaway should have played Belle,Michelle Pfeiffer should&#39;ve been White Queen in Alice,Emma Watson should star as Ingrid in Maleficent.Simple as it is.

I watched it a couple of weeks ago. Good movie. Not great. It had a good story. Angelina Jolie plays the part so well.

That wing spread!

so they did an aunt viv with prince philip.......ok i see

Netflix please

Aurora is the stupidest character ever made..

Oh! I love Disney world!  I know some of the original stories that are presented by Disney. The original stories are really sad but Disney blends them to be so beautiful that you can&#39;t do anything but believe the Disney story. And I didn&#39;t knew this movie, Maleficent 2, was released last year (2019) on my birthday ( 18 October ) I am so glad! Edit: Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t watch it last year!

What a bad movie...so bad.Loved first one.

love maleficieent so badddd
Maleficent Mistress of evil👉

I heard from a reliable source that tyus has Groots origin story which crosses over with guardians. Also it is confirmed that they will reference it during guardians 3 in a dr strange sequence.. makes sence to me since disney owms everything now..

Honestly the movie was pretty dark

Me and my mom just thought it was dumb I mean they could’ve thought of all those ideas at the beginning but no Aurora is just running around in a castle because she was lost no plan again and meanwhile love the maleficent people just went for war with zero plan again and then fairies are trapped in a room oh this is the trap let’s not go to the wedding

I wish they make a sequel of the dark fey story how maleficent races born

After watching the full movie . Meeh😑 I just find it frustrating. The role of  characters so dumb. Aurora and Philip. 🤦🏼‍♀️

too much spoilers lol

They recast the prince for WHAT. Dhjsjsjs what was the purpose lmao

Norse

bruh the way i love the both movies.

The ‘racial’ casting is painful to observe.Every box ticked in the crowd scenes.Apart from that,not too bad.Perhaps how Game of Thrones should have handled the final battle.

Hii

I still haven&#39;t watched it yet. But it looks better than like a marvel movie

pantera
When your mom ask you to do lots of work  ( lockdown )🤣🤣Me: mom this isn&#39;t you 🤨Mom: you do not know me 🤣🤣

To be honest though....I really wish that they told Maleficent&#39;s story through the original storyline rather than screw up the other characters to make Maleficent look good. I mean,, the writers changed King Stephen from a funny and protective king to selfish and evil, the three fairies went from being bickering but competent care-takers to downright idiotic, Prince Phillip went from dashing and brave to dumb, his mom went from being non-existent to being way out of line, and Aurora went from having a personality to also being dumb. Only Maleficent had any depth and sorry but that&#39;s not good writing.

They should have a third of this movie.....funny I always saw it and thought it was a horror film but my sister introduced it to me and I cried especially when beasty tears brought back maleficent to life....Angelina beautiful beautiful movie I loved it

So very disappointed, why didn’t maleficent kill all their asses smh

I love maleficent
<a href="">0:34</a> (PINK FAIRY) Umbridge is that you?😲😱

I’m so confused

Am I the only completely unsatisfied with that ending lol

They showed to much in the trailer

Me: where is the pretty boy, Hanry Turner or what from the firs movie?And what is Liam from Darkest minds doing here with lond hair?!

This was the best i just watched it

Disney always has CERN looking portals in almost every single movie..this one shows the devil coming through one..shame on you Disney

Jajaja beastie

Angelina Jolie is beautiful and amazing in this movie, just as she was in the first one.  We loved it.

Plot twist: the king was really the sleeping beauty of this movie

Maleficent: <b>exists</b>The queen: <b>peace was never an opinion</b>

Me : mom , I got 2 marks cut in exam because of silly mistake😔.Mom: you should have been careful 😑Me : one can never be too careful <a href="">1:32</a>

The goat at the end has a huge dick. This movie feels so Wrong

BEST MALEFICENT MOVIE!!! Was great

Malifesent I love you😍😍😍😍
Watch the whole movie in my channel!😉

The only redeeming quality of this movie, in my opinion, is Angelina Jolie and her cheekbones.

Not same guy playing philip in this movie

wtf is this shit no wtf did they do like do they think they were smart no wtf it should have ended on the first movie.

This movie made me cryyyyy so much 🤣😢
Best movie

Music Behind?

A superb movie. Congratss to all that work for this epic movie

This movie was beatiful I just watched it. It was amazing my emotion were going threw a roller coaster

Work is best
Waiting for part 2 right guySs🤩😍😘
The plot looks like an excuse for action.

In one sentence Aurora was utterly stupid

What a great Angelina
This movie have some racist parts of scene watch carefully they have black actors and Chinese actors they dnt have Indian actors I saw only one kid his Indian I dnt know why white people thing of their self they are so proud when god created all human different and same equally this movie full of racism my point will be if you didt have Indian actor then you shouldn’t keep this kid and show people we are lower then you guys time changes our time will come aswell!!!

Sometimes the one who looks evil isn&#39;t the bad one and the one who looks good isn&#39; that good

When I was young Im really fond of Aurora (cartoon) the human ver. is hmmmm 🤔 A lil stupid?

Loved the first film to bits but my god this movie is a giant pile of shite. Reviews on this film went real easy on this. Very misleading.

maleficent will never dissapoint you.

I love this movie

Ingrith: If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say you were making a threat.Maleficent : well, do you?Ingrith: Do I what?Maleficent: <b>know better?</b> 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I literally have replayed so many parts of the movie mainly because of how insanely powerful Anjelina&#39;s dialogue delivery was.

I watched the movie and it was honestly so spectacular that I wanted to stay in the theater so that I could watch it again 😂 But one thing that I was a little disappointed by was the actor of prince Phillip. I kinda was hoping that he&#39;ll be an African American rather than what the original one looked like. Because I some what wanted to compare their appearances with Audrey&#39;s (From Descendants) but I found nothing 😭

A good villain
am i the only one, who thinks that second part is much more better, than first?

Philip: 5 years ago I..... I looked very different

I had goosebumps throughout this whole trailer holy shit, I didn&#39;t even know they made a 2nd, I need to watch it rn

a soy sort

yes yes I ts krokodil

angjelinagjoi it is a krokodil

<a href="">0:40</a> Maleficent’s brain is way to big <b>SAVAGE LEVEL 100</b>

Bro philip never look same from mlfcnt 1

Jolie was branded as the character in this maleficent movie but it turned out to be the best good beneficial plant
IT WAS SO GOOD!!!!!!! I love it!!

i hate the human girl she makes mistakes everytime because of love

I love it.,. Gonna watch tomorrow 😍😍🥰

If you can’t smile at least one time during the entirety of this movie, then there’s something wrong with you.

Trailer : “She’ll finally get the love of a real mother “  Me: I’m about to bitch slap a hoe

I am about to watch it...omgggggggg

The best movie I&#39;ve ever seen👌😍

Omg I wanna watch this now!!!

this is the foolest movie i ever watched..

ummmhhh is anyone watching here is a Filipino well I just hear the word &#39;TAMA NA &quot;.......<a href="">1:43</a>😅

It is just beautiful

I love this movie bought it on DVD Angelina is so beautiful even with horns and wings

This film is amazing . i watched it tonight.  Wow

This movie is s***..🤬🤬🤬
I actually preferred this new Disney version..... in reality mummy can be a bitch...stepmommas can be a godsend..and which woman wants to lay around on her azz waiting for a man to come wake  her?

🏨&quot;<a href="">#Justice</a>""
Watch my videos and I&#39;ll subscribe to your channel!!😊

I’ve always loved sleeping beauty but I just don’t like these maleficent movies they just took the whole story and put it through a train wreck maleficent in the original movie was evil ok bottom line and was destroyed in dragon form by prince Phillip and they’ve just messed it all up by making her like a good evil whatever she is I just ain’t buying it I tried to watch the first movie and hated it

I can’t decide if I like the actress of aurora or not

Well this looks like a shit movie

Let the movie to be excited, it is not a ETHICS class&#39;s visual show

Just watched this movie and i love it ❤

the story is stupid makes no sense. the first movie was good.

Jolie wasn&#39;t the best choice for her character. She looks ugly. 🙈

<a href=""> here to watch full movie

Lol, Disney always as token black characters in european based fantasies xDDD

I prefer the original story of the brothers grimm

This movie is better then the first

<a href="">1:37</a> HOLY MOTHER OF GOD ANGELINA

Maleficents Skin is clearer that my future

Stop with this forced “diversity”

The movie is awesoooomeee!!!🙌

<a href="">2:02</a> tell me what has happened? there was another creature with a big dick!

It was an ok movie but I was expecting more......

Liked the first one! 2nd one was way better, Angelina is an extremely talented actress! There is no one else that could portray that role so perfectly! 👍

Maleficent: Mistress of CheekbonesBut no seriously, this trailer is awesome! I&#39;m watching the movie today and I can&#39;t wait!!!

HOW FUCKING DARE THEY HURT MY QUEEN(who is meleficent ofc and ALWAYS WILL BE A QUEEN TO ME) and aurora, you stupid ass bitch 😤😂

A movie with a fkig idiot princess

Blockhead

Fcking Writer so sick
How is the title mistress Of evil have a connection with maleficent?

like maleficent
Aww I love Michelle Pfieffer&#39;s performrence in this one!

Maleficent nice to aurora Cinderella : ami a joke to you

When I saw the trailer I immediately hated the queen.

Personally hate this movie because Aurora was useless, and barely did jack. You can give me all then hate you want but I am flippin triggered to the max right low.

Aurora is a dumb and weak and lousy queen.. can&#39;t trust her godmother maleficient and trusted the other queen instead.. she only believe maleficient when she found out the truth but didn&#39;t believe her when she said she did nothing.. i dont understand why movies have dumb character to protect to.. and I would never sacrifice the life of a powerful and smart one to a weak type of person like aurora.. geez!!! The moors need Maleficient while Aurora can&#39;t help anyone but is needed only by a prince to get wed. Maleficient can do a lot more on earth save forest and humans too but Aurora only can show her pretty and pale face. We need Maleficient not Aurora so pleassssssse if there is a other sequel give her a justifiable death scene..

Is it only me who finds Aurora so annoying in this movie?

She&#39;s a beautiful Phoenix ❤

I came here to see the trailer but I just saw the entire movie in 2 minutes ... really ?? that&#39;s how they made trailers ??

wht they changed the prince for another actor?

Just saw the movie it was crazy, it feels like its not a disney movie

Hey guys I have the movie in my channel when you find it please subscribe me and like the video

Best part of this movie was the last part,absolutely  beautiful, good job to all those who made this movie possible. Love it an I&#39;ll definitely  rewatch it again :-) <a href="">#Best</a> movie ever :-) <a href="">#Angela</a> Jolie ur great

I really wanted to like this movie but it was just too senseless especially from second half, but I have to admit there was one of the best cgi I ever saw.

Lmfao she turn to a goat

Can we comment how amazing the score is!!

Did she get younger??!!!! I swear to god this woman does not age

This was honestly a terrible movie

The moral is dont ever do that badthink at your mother . And how ever how many u broke her heart , her will forgive u more than more  ..  wtf  im the guy is 22yrs old crying for this movie ... Goodjobs guy for whos made this film , Tq for this moral story .. may god bless you . 😭

I cried my eyes out after watching it, it was so emotional and touching 😭😭😍😍i like it so much

I like how she call her name &quot;Aurora&quot; <a href="">1:15</a>

This movie is beautifully made. It’s worth the watch

Umm where is Brenton??

<a href="">1:42</a> did I just hear “Tama na!” hahaha 😂
Gawd i love how magical this movie!!!

I&#39;m not even from an english-speaking country, but why do the princess speak in a british accent...? Isn&#39;t that an american actress, so why was it so important that she have a british accent? What does it do? Isn&#39;t it also a fantasy world, where Britain doesn&#39;t even exist?

MALEFICENT 2 is one of the best trailer in my movies life. thank you very much for sharing your video.

This movie was lit🔥

Fuck it! This looks awesome! Even if it&#39;s Angelina Jolie and even if it&#39;s a live action remake just for money. Just this once, i will set my biased opinions aside.

This movie is awesome to watch. I really appreciate Angeline Joline. Watch it on StremFlixPro !!!

Why is she so beautiful? I can&#39;t take my eyes out of her

Such a good movie and Angelina&#39;s performance is perfection in it. Loved that they chose Michelle to play the Evil Queen. What a great combo

Pfeiffer, always perfect.
Aurora - Dumbest princess ever.

Watching it now. I love the powerful portrayal of women and a mother&#39;s love 💜💜💜💜Angelina Jolie did an incredible job! 👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌

Wish to see movie about this flying being.... drop the aurora thing..

I had already watched this it is such a good movie ilove it

I have one word to say “ Fuck Dumb princess aurora”

So beautiful history and the idea behind.... Is fantastic but with a base on the real life.. Like those who believe that those who are different from them are the bad ones or those that should not exist when they are the ones that are full of hate... And that&#39;s how beautiful life has the range of different weird things and diversity.I hope so Walt Disney make more movies like this with this message

That&#39;s amazing the idea behind because they trying show in the movie the most wear people like malrficent is not mean are bad. They are good and one but the humans see them like bad... And everything Is inverse... Is the same in the real life

This movie is even better than the first one. But the first one outperforms in a couple of places, one of those exceptional case was when Maleficent lost her wings and her cry was heard from miles away.

Dissapointed....

Aurora was useless in this movie.

SPOILER ALERTMALEFICENT WILL DIE AND WILL NEVER BE BORN LIKE A PHEONIX😂
The only thing I desagree with this movie is the pheonix being black not being fiery or its real looks

The scene after the war was shit. Seriously? After all the chaos and lives gone cause of Ingrith&#39;s plan, everyone went Okay for a wedding? The rest before that was fine. Proper closure is lacking in this movie.7.7/10



 you can watch

This is such a stupid movie!!! Why can’t they just let Maleficent but evil!!! Smh!!!!! The ending was the worst and stupidest part!! Ugh

gay

Never seen so much multiculturalism  in a fantazy medieval movie in my life , The whole thing is cringe as fuckt,  realy some nasty force shit,   the fucking fey have black , asian , and white, why  they canty just be Fey ?

They didn't say "Mulawin".
I love the movie &gt;~&lt;

Is this movie Angry birds Live action?

dislikes  cames  from Goats...well,well

Ty Disney,Ty Angelina....this  movie  is Epic <b>******</b>

Such a beautiful movie...

Amazing story
So angry birds on steroids 🙂🙂

OMG YOU GUYS SHOULD WATCH THIS, IT WAS SO GOOD!!!!

best movie iv ever seen love it so much

meh

It seems this story has been going on wherever colored people meet Caucasians. Unfortunately, no fairies ever came to the rescue.

Angelina Jolie?? I fucking true love you!! &lt;3 WELL,...WELL!!  <a href="">1:25</a>
Truly amazing!!!  A must see for anyone who loves fantasy and hasn&#39;t seen it yet !!!   I actually cried tears of joy towards the end.  Angelina Jolie is amazing!!  👏👏👏👏

Yoooooo f*****$&amp;#%$ck this u torrent B.S  I downloaded both to watch them and they got the movies backwards so the 2014 was mistress of evil and the 2019 was the 2014.....so I watched the new one before the old one! <a href="">#lifeisruined</a> :(

Its good but i just hate movies that the evil keeps on killing and when male goes to kill her her daughter comes and be like stop this isnt u... bla bla when that bitch killed hundreds and she doesnt want male to kill her

<a href="">0:55</a> 😠

That girl’s character is so fucking dumb

I love you Angelina Jolie
This was a horrible movie. Aurora trows Maleficent under the bus instantly, like &quot;WTH?&quot;, she had zero trust in her. The dark feys are handled so badly. Where have they been all Maleficent life? Why she was left alone? And species that can fly wasn&#39;t able to secure a piece a kingdom to live in all this time, I don&#39;t buy it. The evil Queen was stupidly evil. The war had zero strategy dark feys  just flew in and that&#39;s it. Hundreds of thousands of fairies were slaughtered and a few minutes later they get married like nothing happened, and everyone is happy. The only good thing about this movie was Angelina Jolie and the visuals.

Glad to see political corectness at it best.Alot of black dudes...

well well...... i have no word to say anything. Celebrating New Year 2020 watching it 1st time...Happy New Year Guys......

i love maleficent so isn&#39;t evil .... evil is only humans

I hated the part when stupid Aurora stopped Maleficent to kill the queen. That horny beast always makes troubles.

They really are promoting sympathy for the devil in this

Oi people maleficent if Slovakian I’m Slovakian to and she lives in the same town as me ahhhhh

I so love this movie

Milking every drop out of the &quot;property&quot; they stole from the public domain nearly a century ago.. Shame on these culture vultures.

how did i not hear about this movie ????

Lets be honest Jolie missed having those cheek bones and horns <b>wink</b>

Why is aurora such a bitch?

Go beyondPluuuusss ultraaaaaa
I don&#39;t know about the horror movies that came up in this year but this movie takes all of them down cause damn, this is so lit. The best movie I&#39;ve witnessed in 2019. I swear.

&quot; What?&quot; First one.  To Aurora s statement. &quot; You are my fairy Godmother. &quot; 😆

Maleficent is NOT the mistress of evil. She is good.

The &quot;well well&quot; gets me every time😫💚

scary terry

Maleficent 3 is where hades comes in UwU

I also want to watch it but where?? Thank you
Anyone can tell me where i can watch the movie hd pls? Thank you

&quot;We go home now&quot; -my mother too

Really I like the part 2 ❤️😢😢and it&#39;s so emotional too

What a gorgeous evil...wwwooowwwRegards<a href="">www.leatherhive.com</a>

istg angelina jolie&#39;s cheekbones are so sharp they can stab haters by just existing

Does anyone know that in the french version of the &#39;Sleeping Beauty&#39;; there&#39;s a part after the prince wakes the princess, in which the prince&#39;s mother tries to eat her grandchildren?

The chills I get from just watching the trailer

Bruh now she’s bad but I’m still gonna on her side?

Wawwww very very very nice...
Jennifer Aniston should be hire as the Evil queen.

the prince in the film played by harris dickinson. You guys have you seen his movie beach rats? If not i recommended it. 😂

When malificent is kid hes beautiful

What is the name of the movie?
The background is the copy of lion king

Angelina Jolie is sooo gorgeous
Where can i watc or download this movie can anybody tell me

Remove the movie channels from my youtube page stupid scam the
Brilliance is the girl who believes in herself. This film shines with the Amazing Angelina Jolie....Pure Girl Power.

They making out that maleficent is evil, but she is not! Its the Queen and the humans that are triggering her

I may be a dude but it looks good

Where is brenton thwaites

I just watched the movie and I almost shitted myself

damn it!!
HBO..his darkest materials is great

DUH!! 😁
Well..we broke the cycle..to be a triangle..

Cliffs notes okay🤪🤟
Ffs maleificent meets the matrix🙄

Finally a new movie of this came 😁😁😁

Good movie indeed. Maleficent is a true queen.

Aurora: Look: you crashed my christening, ruined my sixteenth birthday, I would like to at least. Have. A wedding. Without any drama!

Evil

This movie is really good by the way!

Let me just say the queen in this movie is a gigantic B***h!

I know I&#39;m probably alone on this, but this movie is pure evil. The horns on top of her head should give you a clue. Disney is poisoning the minds of our youth with its satanic films. Don&#39;t believe me? Just do a search with, &quot;Subliminal messaging in Disney movies.&quot; Cartoon characters give the satanic horn sign, it&#39;s sick. Please get right with the Lord Jesus Christ and He will remove the blinders from your eyes. What you&#39;ll be able to see will amaze  you. He&#39;s returning soon so there&#39;s not much time left to repent of your sins and to let Him save you by the blood He shed on the cross.

Good grief! That’s hideous!

Always choose your mother

Just saw this and was totally different than I thought it would be! But would recommend! 10/10 ☺️

Disney is so satanic

Link plzzzz☺️
IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!

Dumb American commercial  kitch. Pain in my eyes and my ears and my heart and my soul.

The scene when Maleficent wakes up and meets her fellow fae was so aesthetically pleasing and unexpected! Now I want a fantasy movie about the fae race!

I really love Angelina Jolie, her acting skill and beautiness alwaya amazed me, when I watched maleficient in 2014, Im really amazed by her, she deserve more, LOVE YOU

Can we just talk about her cheekbones like wow 🤩

Lovvvveee this movie even im too told for disney movies but gotta watch part 2 😂❤️❤️👍

thanos: <b>snaps and wipes out maleficent</b>maleficent: <b>UNO reverse card</b>

I was looking forward to Seasone 2 because I enjoyed watching season 1.There were many things to see with scale, action, and story that surpassed season 1 and it was so fun.Especially, the visual beauty was beautiful.

This film is awesome! In 3rd part,Maleficent finds parents who also have daughter who wants to take Maleficent&#39;s place and destroy humans 😂😂😂 ?

IDC WHAT YOU DO PLEASE WATCH THIS <a href="">

I think maleficent on her cycle 1

I just watched maleficent 2014. I haven&#39;t watch this movie for so long bcs I already hated her on the sleeping beauty story. But after I watched the movie, it changed all thing. Can&#39;t wait to watch maleficent 2 🦋✨

Yas

I can’t stop thinking about the movie 😩🥰

The best movie EVER bro I was crying so much 😩 <a href="">#Maleficent</a> 🖤🦇

Watch maleficient movie here dude <a href="">shorturl.at/bTUZ8</a>
AJ is really beautiful

Maleficent is a pure evil fairy, the same as the other good fairies but evil, she wasnt ever the hard done to antihero, the prince saved sleeping beauty with his true love kiss, sleeping beauty had both a loving mother and father who survived into her happily ever after and nothing Angelina Jolie or her depraved friends can do will ever change the truth for a lie.

A goddess with flesh is always raped.But she is not.

I love Diaval so much 🧡🧡🧡
The movie is here on my channel
<a href="">

Theres more human sized fairies?

Well well........ Iconic!!!!

This isn’t the Philip we wanted

I've already seen the film at the cinema and I'm 11 years old
How could Aurora sided at the evil queen??!! Did she still remember that Maleficent is her beloved God mother that raised her and loved her so much??!!

Queen: tonight i consider. her my own.   Maleficent: well  this is my daughter u may not have her

UGH I WANT TO WATCH IT AGAIN!!ITS SAD AND HAPPY

Good God this movie was so friggin good😭

It&#39;s sad that she digs her own grave even deeper after taking on the role of Evelyn Salt and then getting rotten titties and broken uterus because God hated it so much I guess once you cast your own Doom you might as well just eat it for eternity she does the most evil b*<b>*</b> you possibly can she just worships the devil dumbasses.

i hate beautiful angelina but love evil

super nice movie. yesterday i wach this in cenima in Kuwait

The reason she do not want aurora to marry him is she got heart broken by king Steven and she thinks she be in the same condition

&quot;Love doesn&#39;t really end well.&quot;- maleficent

Its good film l like

Some scenes were seem like inspired by GOT. Example: last fight scene ~ Red wedding, When dark faes got down in front of Maleficent ~ s1e1&#39;s ending scene, Gerda ~ Qyburn

Thats scary

One of the fairys dye in the end 😂

I watched it Yesterday in the cinema

This trailer just told me the whole movie

The fucked up thing in this movie is that the reason of the kings death is aurora and maleficent.In the end and in the part 2 they are still friends and aurora treats her as her mother. Aurora releases the wings Maleficent only defended herselfBut the thing is both of them is the reason of aurora&#39;s father&#39;s death

Awesome Movie !!! Don’t forget the popcorn.

This show us that people are not born evil ,certain surcumstances make them evil i think. Or as long as we regret for doing bad things and try to do good we are not so much evil as long as we have a good side of us.

I can&#39;t wait this movie will play soon in the u tube!! Look so great movie. . Vote for my idol@AngelinaJolie 👍

Love it when she calls  her adoptive  daughter  beasty 🤣m2  19 a

SPOILERS:Maleficent just wanted to protect Aurora from getting her heart broken the way she did with Stephan. At the dinner scene, the queen’s goal was to anger Maleficent, put the blame on her for the death of the King so Aurora would turn against Maleficent and start a “war”.Personally, I didn’t understand the scene where Maleficent sacrificed herself to save Aurora from the red dust. Aurora isn’t a fairy, so wouldn’t she be immune? Kinda sounds to me like if that were the case, that whole scene would be rendered pointless

Loved this film! Dont know why rotten tomatoes and all those <b>cough</b> pro critics have it a bad review, but then again, you cant trust them when they prefer Batwoman over Joker

EXACTLY I LOVE THIS MALEFICENT 2

Friends: Hey, our results is out!Me: DON&#39;T, RUIN MY MORNING!

this is 10 times better than Terminator

You can&#39;t stop the girl - Bebe Rexha 🎧

I watched it on cinema, it literally didn&#39;t ruin the viewers expectation. I love it, it was the best.

This movie is really good! Angelina Jolie never fails to deliver!

Meh looks ok

This trailer was good because it didn&#39;t show what really happens in the movie. The movie was really good

<a href="">1:36</a> WOW😯That’s some outfit🖤😍
Did they change the prince’s actor?

OK I say this I didn&#39;t know fairies had horns, I didn&#39;t see part 2 but when a innocent woman is hurt by a man she loves it very painful. To me this isn&#39;t about good and evil but about true love and how it&#39;s channelled. I know what true love is, but same in real life women love tends to be more deeper and more caring and when that shattered retaliation takes a leading role in some.

Now we all wanna be a evil male dickens .-.

Isaiah <a href="">5:20</a> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

Me lookin at her cheekbones fr nearly the whole trailer 🤣😭😳

Loved the movie.

<a href="">1:35</a> wtf

At least she&#39;s not a lesbian.

i have the link of the movie

it looks scary little bit

Elle Fanning (aroura) the most useless character ever made, useless, annoying and stupid wish she never show up on the screen again

Lucy : Yeahhh lets make evil look awesomee!..good is lame..evil is the way..let them know that its ok to worship me coz im the saviour🤞🏼..you guys did a really good job in glamourising evil that people are not afraid of me anymore! Lets rot in hell! yeahhh! 🤘🏼Disney : Hail Satan

In fact it’s the best movie I have seen in the 2019 I highly recommend to go and watch it. It is going to make your day♥️

GREAT MOVIE!!!

They changed the actor for Phillip.Fuck didney

Angelina Jolie is super hot in that film also great character! Great film overall!

Ugh I love this movie so much!! If you can, please go see it. It’s amazing 💚

I&#39;m not the only one who hated Aurora&#39;s role rightAll throughout the movie, I was wishing maleficent to just forget about her since all Aurora ever did was to cause her pain and betrayal.

<b>that&#39;s weird</b><b>I saw the movie today</b>

I watched it!! In cinema! Its so beautiful! Watch it now guys!!

To be honest, I want to watch this more than Frozen 2

Aurora: This isn&#39;t you—Maleficent: You do not know me!

download fim malficent mistress of evil 2019 sub indo :



cinemaindoxxi*xyz/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-2019


Note: replace * with .
I&#39;m looking for comments about the movie but all I see are memes..😑😑

I really hope that she goes on a rampage because she knows something Aurora doesn’t about the mother in law/fiancé and she ends up being right and Aurora realized that after Maleficent apologizes for being cruel when she was angry 😭 I have see this now

I guarantee Maleficent is right about them not getting married and it turns out the mother in law is the evil one. I’m all for Maleficent being the good guy who just looks like the bad guy because she is being overprotective of her daughter. Please, please don’t make her into the bad guy when the first movie disproved that legend!

it sounds really cool 😁

Really liked maleficent 2 really entertaining. 10 thumbs up.

I love maleficent movie.I watch them in cinema and I love them.Angelina Jolie is the most beautiful woman in the world alive.I love love love Angelina and I want too see again with Brad Pitt.(LIKE WHO IS WITH ME).BRANGELINA IS AGAIN TOGETHER.Elle Fanning is new actor and she is soo cute.

Diaval (Sam Riley)  deserved more screen time 😔

I recommend this movie ,🥰❤️❤️ N I C E
Just seen the movie - WOW!!! 10/10-  BTW. Bring a hankie!!

I immediately fall in love with Angelina when she untie her hair!!!😍😍😍

When served a dish...Maleficent: Bird!!! Delicious!!! Diaval : Oh my God!!! I'm a bird. (in his heart)
love this movie enough that inspire me to make a halloween costume,  low-key a youtuber here 🎃🕸

this was probably one of the best movies i’ve seen

i feel like i saw the whole movie from the trailer

never been the evil, pretty like that

I just watched this movie. Honestly, this is a very beautiful movie. Movie for the entire family, totally worth it.

I just watched it, it was amazing..

Isn&#39;t that the castle of the beauty and the beast??!!!

I thought she was still a lizard but okay.

Watched it a few hours ago. Its 10/10 for me. Very visually pleasing and the story is very entertaining. Unlike most sequels it actually ties in pretty well with the first movie. It&#39;s really good I recommend.

I have been watched that yesterday full movie and it’s so very beautiful story.

Tonight I consider Aurora my ownMaleficent:Oh hell nah I went against my nature for this child

Great movie just got done watching👍🏼

Monster in-law 2

I swear!!!!.I just watched it and it was AMAZING!!!! Maleficent nearly died and prince Philip’s mother cursed the king it wasn’t Maleficent and there are more of Maleficent’s kind (there are more of her relatives!!!!!) One of my fav quotes from the movie :“Remember where you came from”“Curses are not cured,they are broken” (Not sure about the 2nd one but it was there)

philip is replaced by another actor 🙃

Maleficent not evil..she just want protect her child. &lt;3

The best story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
<a href="">1:46</a> You do not <b>Note is my liar is my Peyk</b>(Only Filipinos understand this😂)

Love Angelina Jolie &lt;3
This is the best movie ever all the other Disney princess movie remakes don&#39;t hold a candle to this.

Where can I download it

Shawkat comes to our entire cinema 😘
Maleficent will die( biggest spoiler )

U know i just watch that full movie its so great and i found out malifecent didnt curse the king the queen killed the king and there a happily kiss

I jinjja love this movie so freaking much. Ugh

Looks like inpired from a southindian movie ... I think name of the movie is <a href="">#Puli</a> lead actor <a href="">#Vijay</a>

I just saw this movie tonight and it was magnificent! Angelina Jolie never fails as Maleficent! And those little “kruk-kruks” are so cute!!! I think I’m gonna see it one more time! And I want Maleficent 3, also, in the near future!😀

I   do not Know  What To say about This       Full   Story Female  MALEFICENT 2   but        One  think   that  I Love to  Watch  When        this     MISTRESS    OF   EVIL  never  die       and THE  ENDING of it,  FeMALEFICENT       Safe   a    Lot of   Residences  and Unite        Two   World,  live  Peaceful  &amp;  Harmony         <b>***********EVER After Forever********</b>       Please   Take   This Jokes,  K.

I just saw it, such a great film, surprisingly even better than the first I&#39;d say!

Loved the movie but when I saw them fairies normalized through a pile of dust o was like HOLY SHIT O.O.............. those plants I be loving n hugging up was fucking fairies.........like I always tell myself that plants r a whole lot more than they look you&#39;d be surprised besides I talk to plants........why u ask? cause I thought it was normal n didn&#39;t give billion shits about what anyone said. T.T

Just saw this and was very pleased!!!! Way better than the 1st!! You won&#39;t be disappointed if you&#39;re wondering if you should wait or go to theater.

I love this film. I really love films which tells the story in the perspective of the villain. I made a review of this movie, kindly watch it :)

Felt like copied from “My Date with A Vampire 3....”“Maleficent” are a colony,legions...

Michelle Pfeiffer a truly beautiful  Hoolywood actress, who bewitched and impressed us with her beauty her class, her style and her acting. In scarface, to dangerous minds and even as  catwomen  in Batman. In so many movies was Michelle Pfeiffe the female heroine, , if she was not the female heroine, she was the poor, sweet, beautiful and lovly victim. Or in some cases the beautiful evil witch. And in all her roles we were bewitched by her.So how comes, she became in this movie MALEFICENT 2 an evil not  symphatic or wonderful  and even from the audience not liked character????what can the reason be?              THE REASON ISANGELINA JOLIE; whoever makes a movie with Angelina Jolie as her enemy will turn from a linewand star, to a we wish her death charackter. Angelina Jolie a women more beautiful than any women I ever dreamed of.I know every person has his own opinion but dont come me with Angelina Jolie is not beautiful  comments, because its impossible to discuss optic beauty with blind people.

Go watch movies like Godfather or Irishman, not these bullshits

I&#39;m seeing this at the cinema today woop woop! Exited but kinda scared tbh 😂😂😂😂

Maleficent Never disappointing me😭😭😭 this movie make me cry

Very nice movie

&quot;PEOPLE CHANGE IF THEY FEEL PAIN.&quot;MALEFICENT IS A PROOF THO:&gt;

First time I support devil 😈
That famous line: &quot;What an awkward situation&quot; &quot;well well&quot;

We wan’t maleficent 3!
I love love love the movie:)

Maleficent&#39;s a Dumbledore.
It was amazing, so worth it

This Movie Was Magnificent, I almost cry when Malificent died and Also I love how the story was created

Just watched the movie and it’s amazing! Made me cry once 😔😭

Really wishing this girl is going to be in the next part3 <a href=""> Watch her she really look like maleficent&#39;s daughter

Dope movie 🔥🔥
Good movie liked the 2nd one better than the first one

La Jolie is perfect

<a href="">1:20</a> mAlEfiCeNt iS a ThReAt To EvEryOnE

But, why ? I don&#39;t get the purpose of this movie the 1st one should&#39;ve bin it. It was a drag too. The story of this one seems forced too. Just like the last one.

Jean Grey: I am The Dark Phoenix!Maleficent: Hold my wand. 😏

they&#39;re trying to push this idea of Maleficent being a good character, creating whole new background of her. In reality, she&#39;s just a sour magician who didn&#39;t get invited to the party. And the revenge she chose is to kill the new born baby! Thanks to the three good fairies, Aurora&#39;s death &#39;sentence&#39; would revert to only a sleep until her true love can break the spell. What a nice lady this Maleficent is.

Lol I love disneyland paris

It was amazing. I just watched the full movie at: lushflix (dot) net.

Oz the great and powerful 2?

this movie was awesome i watched it yesterday

day by day i am getting obssesed  with maleficent  i mean the acting of angelina joulie an the movie and everything is just amazing espeacilly the acting skills of angelina joulie

Can anyone tell me the name of the song playing please ?

I think Maleficent is not really a bad woman she just trys to protect Aurora😁And plus, i like her dresses 😍

wait ..who&#39;s the evil here? 🤔

Aurora darling listen to your mother

I get it&#39;s been 5 years but prince Philip must have gotten some plastics done he be looking way different from the first film 😂

Just watched it today not thinking it could be as good as the first but wow im impressed it was AMAZING!!😍 i really want to watch the 2nd again😂

Maleficent 2 spoiler: 👸🏼-&gt;🐏
Don’t, ruin my morning!
Sora:”Donald ,hold ma keyblade”
Don&#39;t ruin her morning!
Then I just realized maleficent is good❣️ she just want The Best for Aurora she&#39;s so funny in the movie I just watched right now

i have not seen this movie until now! please no spoiler! &quot;don&#39;t!! ruin my morning..&quot;

OMG

Who watch the movie already?

Aurora please take care your godmother!!! She nice and want to protect you from evils

Who knew that Angelina Jolie&#39;s best role would be that of a bat shit crazy witch.... I&#39;m sure the transformation as an actor wasn&#39;t that much of a stretch for her.

I haven&#39;t watched this yet but I can already tell that the first part is better

I just watched it would totally recommend 5 star film I loved it

UWU

I saw the movie! It&#39;s the best film ! Crying alert at the end !♡

Wow amazing

The end gave all disney lovers CHILLS BRUH

<a href="">0:38</a>

When says says “don’t ruin my morning” I get literal chills. Like, her voice  givs me life, but at the same time, her expression makes me shit myself.

i just watched it and i

I think i love it

Can we have Mal(Dove Cameron) on the 3rd film😂

There is so much to learn from the movie, even if it is a fairy tale it uses dozens of metaphors and has a strong message. One is undoubtedly nature and the environment which we don&#39;t care about nowadays. The other is relationships, power, and many more. It is definitely a must-watch movie, I felt so refreshed and full life after the movie. Also, there is a need to mention that the film stands out with its cinematography; it merely was brilliantly well done. Good job!

Watched it today, its great

First of all why would u touch a needle in the middle of a creepy castle ??MALEFICENT is still an awesome character.

I love this movie i have already saw it

I was an amazing movie 😍

Today I watched in the cinema and we are like the queen should die and  Maleficent should win. I watched today bc my friend had bday

Soooooo dumb
going to watch maleficent 2 in an hour that is why I&#39;m watching the trailer (never watched the first movie )

Watched it yesterday.Still cant stop thinking about it😭.Her appearance right after she woke up in the lair was just sooo speechless😶.

big man do big poo
Maleficent&#39;s story is longer than the main character which is sleeping beauty 😂😂😂😂😂

Jenn murray 😘
Miyavi!

My brother is scared of Malaficent... this makes him go to sleep...😂😂

It’s very sad 😢

EEKKKK!!! I&#39;M SO EXITED

I love this movie 😍

i still prefer the cartoon version

It gonna be a good or bad end ?    Aurora gonna be with maleficent or who ?  Will maleficent die ???( for who knows !)

Rawr

Just watched it two times and tonight will be my third one ... im addicted its the best movie for me i really fell in love ^-^

And then I realized that she is Angelina Jolie.

When I watched this trailer I didn&#39;t noticed that there are many maleficent! I was shocked when I saw them in the movie lol

Thought I heard Aurora shout &quot;Tama na!&quot; at <a href="">1:42</a>

Maleficent is probably the protagonist. I’m really excited. I’m gonna go watch the movie now bye 👋Edit: IT WAS FUCKING GREAT. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS

IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! YʼALL BETTER GO WATCH IT!!
I’m 15 years old and I’m very eager to watch this!The first one was beyond remarkable and I hope this one exceeds my expectations despite the fact they are VERY high.

I jut watched it....

Here is proof that the good in the eyes of people have hidden bad behavior.. they don't know that what they think is bad has a good heart and does good to the majority..
Hey! What&#39;s so wrong with me that you had to cancel my marriage with my fiancee and attack my mother!?

Beasty movie ever!!

That was the worst movie. Such crap lazy writing!!

Why does the evil ones always turn out the best looking!

WAAAHH

My favourite princess movie is maleficent

Don&#39;t ruin my mornimg-
I love malificent Over all I don&#39;t like the movie because it turn out that the real enemy here is the daughter. Tsk Tsk.  Watch this movie and make your own judgement.  cinematography is good the story is bad.

The movie is so true, Daughters has always been a shame to their parents. They always choose bring   they parents into humiliating situatuation and destruction by their idiot wills. Tsk Tsk.

I just got back from watching this movie it was amazing graphics and everything I suggest everyone who wants to watch it go for it was 👍

Meleficent is my favorite

I already seen it spoiler alert the  villain is the mom and maleficent is the good guy

I watched the movie

Maleficent is a good mother. She’s trying to save Aurora. But Aurora didn’t believe her at first. That’s really broke Maleficent’s heart🥺. She was died by Saving Aurora but, she was waken up and become a very big big big birds and powerful. I love that part the most. At the end, the war is end and the Queen of Ulstead is the loser. Maleficent turn the queen into a goat 🐐 with horn😂. Prince Phillip and Aurora is getting married 👰.I recommended you guys to watch this movie because it is the best best best movie ever. Rating: 9/10

This is A GOOOD ASS MOVIE !!

I love this movie I saw it 5 times 😍 is someone like me ?

Yay a new 3rd sequel to the 1950 sleeping beauty and maleficent. (I’m watching it today)

This movie was awesome. My favorite Disney movie among the princesses story. Salute to the director and casts.

aurora was my role model of disney princess before, but when i realise how stupid she is now, I&#39;m moving on with Elsa, jasmine, belle, and mulan..

Honestly the trailer was misleading for me I thought the blonde older lady was aurora’s mother lol

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars: when I saw this movie I couldn’t stop thinking about it
Ugggh those cheekbones😍😂

Pure illuminati production peoples make bafomet human head
If only prince Harry had Maleficent to warn him before his wedding...

Could quite fancy a night in the sack with Maleficent.

Me to my alarm: DON&#39;T RUIN MY MORNING

Damnnnn this so lit 🔥

It  not interest and not fun.why in end of movie is happy ending. All line of movie it have kill and died. Omg.

Anyone know what the name of the cute fellow that looks like a mushroom from the beginning of the movie called? The one that got caught in the jar? :o 🍄

I already watch this movie!It&#39;s so lit and mind-blowingIf you think she is bad at this movie NO! she was trying to protect Aurora because the mother of groom is bad that kills moors do, moors and the people will have peace? Or forever war?WATCH THE MOVIE!**sorry for a little bit spoil the movie but WATCH IT NOW!love u maleficent🙈💙

Is the mother in law actually evil ?

Best movie ever Like if u agree👇🏻
Very cool film, lots of moral messages, like don't just look at people from outside, and we have to be able to live side by side with whoever it is, and also give mother's love for children, you will definitely do everything, the main points in this film are mixed, sad, happy, funny. All in all, the best film in my opinion.
who else fantasizing about maleficent ?

His kiss wasn&#39;t true love to begin with In the first movie🙄

Indra:Tonight I consider Aurora... My ownMaleficent: I know you fucking lyin👿

Queen Indra was the goat... Literally😂If you know you know

I don't need to watch it after the announcement, they burned everything
the movie was soooooo liiittt!!!!!!!

Disney has gone British.

THIS MOVIE WAS SO SO SO DOPE

Wow angelina jolie super...

poor maleficient for having such a dumb step daughter. aurora is the dumbest character ever created on hollywood.

We watched the movie and it&#39;s so beautiful. Worth to watch. Love it!❤👍

Mene Dekh li.. Kbki Hindi dubbed movie... Thik hi lagi mjhe to😂😂

I am going to watch it today I hope it’s worth it

I will be seeing this movie next thursday omg I feel like crying

In my opinion, I think the 2nd is better than the 1st

AURORA SHOULD’VE ENDED UP WITH DIAVAL

woooooooow

what is the  name of trailer music ? tell me please?

Just a ild guess but i think malefecient is pregnat with her own baby cause  this man says &quot;you spent long time to carry human but now.... you carry your own...&quot; i dont think thats the right words he say but i really think that malefecient is pregnant😅 its just a guess though🤔

Celebrating a female version of satan as a saviour? This world is getting worse.

Angelina was wonderful as ever but prince Philip was a little bit ugly. I&#39;d rather prefer Chris Hemsworth for the role of prince..

It's cool, it's really annoying, I hope the film is more exciting than the tailer
I&#39;m  support joli in this story

Soo beautiful movie😍😍
The one who watched the movie...<b>Maleficent X Bora</b> ❤️❤️❤️❤️

What a great movie

I just watched this movie. I TOTALLY RECVOMMEND IT

Saw it yesterday and its great.

It was soo good! I want to watch it again !

i just got home from watching it and i have to say that this one, in my opinion, is WAAAYYY better than the first. i love it, 10/10.

Why  malevolent don&#39;t ask auroral marriages because the  queue is evil

Done watching this yesterday ..so full of thrill 😁😁

Who watched the full movie and then watched the trailer?👀😂🍿🎬🎥Me🙋😂👇

&quot;Love doesnt always end well beasty...&quot;                                           ~Maleficent 2019True dat 😂😭💕
i loved the movie Angelina is the best actress ever such talent ♥️♥️♥️

i really don’t understand why people have to push dislike button,if u don’t like just move on and watch the porn!!

I never loved wings so much

I&#39;ve watched this yesterday, and I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s <b>AMAZING</b>

I watched it today :D

This movie was racist to show the black people all servants in the movie and the one black guy that saves maleficent dies trying to help her. Typical racist scenes for the black people in the movie. All shown as servants or people to sacrifice for another’s happiness!

This movie was amazing!

I just watched the movie today and it’s the best thing ever!!

I watched the movie and not the trailer first because I knew it would spoil too much! And I was right. If you think the movie will be good don’t watch the trailer!

Mom:wake up ur gonna be late for schoolme:dont   ruin   my     morningmom:*carries sslippers*me:MOM AM READY

Angelina is gorgeous OMG I’m forever a fan of her beauty (forgive my shallowness for once 😂she’s too beautiful)

Just seen it yesterday it was good i did a review on it check it out and leave feed back thanks

It's so good that we watched it yesterday
i watched this today in 3D, it was amazing

I hope for a sequel with Maleficent on having a 2nd chance on true love.

I don&#39;t like it 😒 I think this movie made for teens

Just watched it in cinema and it&#39;s so fucking worth it

When is part three and part four coming?

I’m so excited that they made Part one and part two

I’ve watched the movie awhile ago. I swear the trailer is unexpectedly different from the movie. The movie is awesome

I've watched it and the film is really cool... 😍😍
I just watched this movie last night, it was soooo magically amazingggg 😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
9/10...movie

<a href="">1:37</a> After this shows up I ready my self to say plus ultra but when I see <a href="">1:41</a> It wasn&#39;t in there lmaoI know this is not an anime, and It&#39;s a good movie to watch btw Hahhahahahhaha

I love Disney movies!!!!They always do such a great job.

Pls don&#39;t be mad I like the movie

Seein it today!

I just watched this movie..it won&#39;t disappoint. :)

Honestly, have you tried it a lot? He sold it and it became mine An awesome penis that any wife would wish for😍This is the doctor’s number👨‍⚕️ on WhatsApp <b>00212645760441</b>
Can’t wait 😍😍😍
So...  shes in a cult. Wonderful!Like every mother should be in!

Honestly, loved the movie!Just watched it today!

Om my god you can say it

Fuck

Kk

did she just say &quot;tama na!&quot; tagalog word. like. what?

well done.!!! angelina will be angelina.. awesome movie.. worth enough to be paid...!!!

I feel like i am the only male person commenting on this.....

This is so cool! My brother just sent me the text. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!

I cried two time in the cinema,The second time I was <b>s o b b i n g</b>

i just watched it, it’s so good.

Who&#39;s here after Lloyd Cadena&#39;s Baliwficent? 😂😂😂

So fucking great movie,make me laugh and cry in the same time

The movie was just “wow “( recommend it so much ) and one of the best Disney movie

I just went to see this and its the best movie I have ever seen. All 4 of us came out of the cinema wondering why it had been given such bad reviews. We all left confused cause we all just LOVED this movie SoooooooOOOOOOOoooooOOOOO!!!!!! Much!!!!!!

just watched this movie and I gotta say it was GREAT!

<a href="">1:26</a>I WAITING  FOR THIS WORD FINNALY!

It&#39;s pretty obvious, the demon lady was right all along and she was good all along and the queen lady is trynna manipulate the girl obviously they battle demon lady wins the end...

I am sure they cast some actors as favors or personal taste: They shouldn&#39;t. Michelle Pfiffer is The Wrong actress for such an, what&#39;s supposed to be, epic film. Elle Fanning, too, but M. Pfiffer more.

Just finished this movie watcing, it was AWesOme!!!!

What a great movie it was... bravo bravo !!👌😁🎉

Who’s here after watching the movie ? 🖐Thanks for the likes and happy holidays ! 💕

Is this m or ma15+

I watched it the queen cursed the king AND FUNNY PART AT THE ENDING MALEFICENT TURNED HER INTO A GOAT 😂🐐🐐🐐🐐

I just saw the movie and wooooo that movie is awesome it&#39;s probably my new favorite movie it has the right amount of action magic and emotion I can&#39;t even tell you how many times I wanted to cry in that theater but I didn&#39;t because I wasn&#39;t by myself lol. If you are thinking about seeing this movie please do it&#39;s worth it!!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

At first i was like.  Ugh..  Cliché storytelling.. But then..  At the last moment.. Holy fuck..  She&#39;s not alone

Dam this looks good

Maleficent is a QUEEN ❤️ 👑
Maleficent is magnificent! Angelina is life.

You NEVER insult a Mother or try to replace her. Oh she&#39;s gonna learn Today! lol

Jolie better not die in this or I will cry my heart out

I want to see this melfince story in the Kingdom Heart Seris game

I Love Malafect

I watch MALEFICENT 2 trailers for many times! And it never boring!! I love MALEFICENT 2 so muchhhhhh💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓Today is the dayyyyyyyy!!!!!!  Finally!!!!!!!
When in-laws bicker, all hell will break loose.😂

I hate Arora! Ungrateful daughter!
Today I’m going  to  the movie theatre  to watch this movie

Beasty should marry the eagle man. Stupid aurora

the movie is amazing !!

Please, tell me. Did they use the same prince from the movie 5 years ago?

<a href="">1:37</a> GO BEYOND PLUS ULTRA

Their fucked if Maleficent was already hard enough to deal with by herself. Now she got her whole species by her side.

Watched it last night on it&#39;s release day and today feel like watching it again already!

😱 Im so happy im gonna see this Friday

In the movie, I think Maleficent isn&#39;t really evil. She is just protective of Aurora, whom she has come to regard as her own daughter. She doesn&#39;t want her to be hurt in love as she once did. The truly scheming one is the queen, who I think secretly wants to create a pretext for war.

Oh oh oh oh this is really a good movie

Nice movie

This movie sucked

Aurora and the bird (forgot his name) have more chemistry than that other guy.

im excited to see ds movie..i love it..

Who actually is the woman who says: &quot;I consider her my own&quot;? Bcos her biological mother didn&#39;t die in the first one but then it wouldn&#39;t make sense for her to say that in such a way

I watched this movie it was amazing no doubt at all!

I just watched the movie an hour ago and it was so good, i would recommend it to everyone

I&#39;m going with my school to see it can&#39;t wait even that I&#39;m making only 4 hours in school

It comes out tomorrow im so late but it looks so goooooooood

Watched yesterday and i can tell that the movie was boring

argh god it&#39;s turned into cosplay.

But why would she be evil again? Last time she had a reason, this is just bs...

What name song???

My tears drop and thank god its happy ending movie..from the start till the climax my heart was trembling,its about truelove between mother and daughter,trust your mother girls,there is no need to explain beyond the matters until u did the mistake,love my mom forever..

Omg omg omg iam waiting for tomorrow.....

&quot;You do not know me.&quot; What? You lost your wings and then cursed a baby. And you repented of it later.

Who else is watching it this weekend

Hasnt anyone seen how maleficent was as a kid she was soooo pure like aurora! 💟🖤

Honestly i see where Maleficent is coming from

Philip: do you wanna m..Aurora: YEaash
this looks so phoned in

I&#39;ll already watch this movie..

Even if Maleficent is in the wrong which I highly doubt. I&#39;m still rooting for her.

go Jolie, keep your up
Lame

<a href="">2:15</a> <b>HEIMDALL IS THAT YOU</b>

I thought maleficent became a good person. What happened again?.....

Tbh when her eyes turn green it reminds me of killer frost cause when they both get mad there eyes turn different colors🤩

I am supporting a villain for the first time😂😶

I just finished watching it, it was so amazing ❤️❤️❤️
When maleficents eyes turn green you know shit is about to go down

Will all the other creatures on her realm suffer because of her own drama again?, Lol!

Wow, just 1 expression brought me to tears in a trailer at <a href="">1:48</a> strong! 🥰🤧

mom : wake up now or you’re gonna be late for schoolme : don’t ruin my morning

Done watching this earlier in Big Screen, It was AWESOME, COLORFUL and MAGICAL!!! love it!!!!

lol

damn angelina jolie is so gorgeous xD

I don&#39;t know why...poor maleficent...

OMG it&#39;s coming on my birthday<a href="">#special</a>😆😆😉😘❤❤❤
I’m watching this on Friday..can’t wait, I’m still rooting for auroura and malicifent!

In Elsas words You cant marry a man you just met. I mean right???

This year it’s all about the villains. I am team maleficent

I&#39;m sold... it looks intense!

All this happen bc aurora accepted the proposal , well done aurora

I hope everyone has more nood in the movie :&lt; I watched part one more than 100 times. legit :&lt; I want to watch the part 2 aaaa
Hype hype hype
Okayyy sooo is that guy Jared Leto? pfffff

Smoooth

😍My fav movie.. She don&#39;t want her daughter to fall in love.. Bcuz she already feel how hurt a heart broken was..

Aurora knows Malificent is Malificsnt but still calls her fairy god mother?😂Also you can’t exactly blame aurora for making those decisions when she has never really met anyone so of course she would jump to someone who loves her just like malificent did, she just needs to learn the consequences herself.

I always wait maleficent has her own story, she is an amazing character...

Wait whos side we supposed to be on

This about to be lit

I feel like I just watched the movie already with all the spoilers in this trailer

Very cool movie, I can&#39;t wait to watch it, from cinema in Indonesia

*5

I literally been waiting like six years to watch this movie

Please what time is the movie gonna be shown.   Its 18th what time please Wil it be available on cinema

WOW...Jolie Angelina again in a very tough and wonderful role which only she can do...superb scenes with so many colors engamatic feel it gives love to watch and as we love Angelina like angels love...

cant wait to watch maleficent beat the shit out of some humans

<a href="">1:41</a> &quot;TAMA NA!&quot;

OMG im looking forward
<a href="">1:45</a> &quot;YOU DO NOTE&quot; IS THE MADER OF MY PEYK! HINDI KA MUNA PAPASOK SA SCHOOL AURORA!

Oh snap...... tony stark become a pirates with ablity to talk animals

Love doesn&#39;t always end well, Beasty!Maleficent just can&#39;t move on from it.

Nice and im going to see the movie tho with my family so yup

Me: True love does exist. Maleficent: Hold my staff! I&#39;m aboot to end his bloodline!Me: Fuck!

Why should I go to the cinema!? I already know what happens! Trailer told me everything!!! like seriously!!

And her own was Mal from Descendants.

Elle Fanning is 5’8” but she seems 5’4” next to Angelina who is 5’7”.

I hate humans they always assume things like “Maleficent is bad and she cursed a baby” like do you even know how the baby ends and how Maleficent change? Well not really.. but yeah..

The Queen is liaising me off now

MALEFICENT 2: MISTRESS OF EVIL Official Trailer #2 (2019) Angelina Jolie, Disney Movie HD<a href="">
What is a tiger&#39;s favorite princess?aROARa

Free netflix<a href="">

Spotted Angelina Jolie in London at Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil premiere <a href="">

Maleficent....Dont ruin my morning..Love that statement.

Disney is literally taking our money this year😂

Well well well 😎

Or Maybe I could say that Maleficient is a real queen control....i&#39;m guessing so

what an ungreatful stupid child.... I mean the second the queen spoke to her mother like that she should have left. Especially because in that situation you could easily see Maleficent was being the bigger person. She&#39;s over protective of her daughter yes, but if someone really loved her she showed she was willing to give it a chance. Yet the queen insulted her on the spot speaking to Maleficent as if she were a stupid animal.

Why has she gone bad again for gods sake 😂

Well shit, Sleeping beauty has a lot more secrets than I expected

Maleficent is bae af js
I just hope Maleficent and Aurora end up married..

Swiper is going to snatch maleficent horns 😏

Melifecent is back as villain

Maleficent 2: The Horror of Stepmother

X V I - Darkness is the song that starts at <a href="">1:28</a>

Happy this movie was done I enjoyed the first one and love the actor that plays the Crow 💗

I thought the first one was amazing, but when I saw this trailer, OH MY GOSHHH!!!

It looks like it&#39;s a story of two mother figures being super protective in their own ways and now they&#39;re fighting for power...this is gonna be interesting.

<a href="">0:23</a> When you woke up to use phone and then your brother ask you to make breakfast... XD

my mom: &quot;get up for school&quot;me: <a href="">0:23</a>

I Swear her cheekbones are so sharp it could cut Wonder Woman&#39;s lasso😆😆

countint the days to see this movie

This was not needed

This is what I call a badass trailer. BGM intensified it 100 times. Rooting for maleficent. Go queen destroy them all.

Don&#39;t ruin my morning!!!! i am so addicted with this movie i can&#39;t recall how many times i&#39;ve watched the first <a href="">one.No</a> one can portray this role as powerful as Angelina.

Is maleficent aurora&#39;s mother?

18 is just about now

<a href="">1:37</a> dang malificent the outfit tho

What a wonderful trailer. I seen several times still unfulfilled. Angelina Jolie is so talent actress. I admire her always.

Another trailer that showed entirely too much.

Where is aish performance

another trailer? so Maleficent sure has her own race.  interesting

THE STEP MOM MADE MALIFICENT MAD ITS HER FAULT WTF 😂😂😅

Omg really!?

Male efficiency is no fairy tale xD

Ugh stan malificent all the way 💆‍♀️
CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING ON WHY NO ONE LET ME WATCH THIS EARLY AND WHY IT DIDNT SHOWED ON MY RECS

Like seriously x.x she changed her life for you. She became your god mother. SHE RAISES AND TRIES TO PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING HURT. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HER. AND THIS IS HOW YOU <b>TREAT HER?!</b>

All because u wanna get married!!!!😭

AS ANGELINA JOLIE AGES, she is truly becoming Maleficent - in the flesh ! Demonic possession ?

I&#39;m pumped. I cannot wait. I got my money lined up just for this movie. The Joker and IT can wait. Disney is first priority😍😍😱

Yeah, She and Aishwarya Rai have really similar voice. Nice choice for Hindi version. Kudos

Why is it i feel like I&#39;ve watched the whole movie..

no one can act better maleficent, than Angelina Jolie

Oh wow, yet another Disney sequel that nobody asked for.

Forget the horns those cheekbones are enough to pierce my soul.
