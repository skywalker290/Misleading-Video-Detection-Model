That&#39;s how Lily&#39;s Garden works
STILL GOATED,  MY MIDDLE NAME ENDED UP BEING SOME FORM OF LILLY HAHA

The way he said Family took me out 

Im so sorry on behalf of my country

do that he gotta get wacked

Dorine is my mom&#39;s name

I love it

9+…This is an e10+ game. Yep

This video traumatized me for 2 days at the past lol

That&#39;s how mafia works

It is a shame felix did not watch these in chronological order to properly digest the lily&#39;s garden lore. Alas, that just how it be on this beach of an earth.

The game is fun. I like it.

These stupid matching games…they’re so dumb and they think they can hook you with these dumb stories and drama…I don’t know what’s sadder, the content? Or the fact that we fall for it?

Developer: lemme make an adsAds:

If anyone is interested in these ads for Lilly’s garden bijuu Mike did a whole series

GET-A-LIFE-GAY -GUY DO YOU KNOW HOW RIDICULOUS YOU SOUND SITTING THERE JUDGING A GARDEN GAME - WHAT A FKG WEIRDO ……
Pewds: &quot;who cares&quot;Matpat: loooooooorrrrreeeeee!!!!!

Maybe Susan had childhood trauma of people making fun of her teeth

I hate Lilly&#39;s garden and her smile

theres a whole storyline and damn its confusing as hell (Game Theory made a video trying to figure out the lore and storyline just search lily&#39;s garden game theory timeline)

Damm 2 years gone by already

Look into Merge mansion. There’s so much lore and they’re using Kathy Bates in their live action ads. It’s too good

Lily&#39;s garden is like a soap opera 

The title alone ended me 

Don’t say Jesus Christ name in a bad way

Thank god i did not experience thisMy first time seeing this adsI mostly dont get ads cause i play gacha games like OP the Strongest,OnePieceTreasureCruise,IllusionConnect,EpicSeven

A

I shit you not, I just took a shit. It was MASSIVE. it came out fast tho? Am I pregnan?! AMOGUS

Helo

pewds: <b>LILLY IS A FUCKING...</b>.<b>WE&#39;LLBE RIGHT BACK</b>

<a href="">2:29</a>

me being named Lily 

She looks like zues!
Its funny how mobile ads are basically allowed to false advertiseShowing one thing in the ads then if you play its literally nothing like the ad

What you never played tuber simulator

Man, at least the ads were finished. Now there is just a simple style to every add I see, little stick figures. I don’t want little stick figure

I played it before the.shitty adds it was kinda fun

Hell nah I ain&#39;t , playing this game

Was it ever confirmed she&#39;s the one named Lilly?

Pewdiepie I saw many videos on tiktok about your song (Bitch lasanga) and your song got popular on tiktok and everyone they using your song :3

i think blaine went to find lilys teeth ngl

<a href="">2:36</a> good one, Sive

<b>I feel like Lily’s “garden” is supposed to be her BUSH.</b>

What he doesn’t get is NONE OF THIS HAPPENS IN THE GAME, The ads are bullshit lmao

my grandmother dislikes the vid

the sam'o'nella videos
Spotted Red Letter Media in Pewds recommended videos. 

<a href="">4:34</a> you can not tell me this is allowed and convince meEdit) I just realized this is here massaging her entire body not just that part but pewdiepie convinced me it was that

Lily had an abortion D:

I literally had a shitty game ad before this vid ;0

<a href="">9:38</a> if i learn to animate like that ima make someone hang lily above a fire and leave her there

<a href="">6:47</a> imagine a game rated 4+ and the ads is inside a stripe club lol

I love how he just roasts her 

i secretly think lily is my roblox gf

I have been complaining about this to anyone and everyone for almost a year now!! Those ads are horrible and I don&#39;t know what the advertising team are thinking with the majority of these ads. They suck.

Lily’s Garden has lore kinda

Apple : Bans FortniteAlso Apple : Doesn&#39;t ban This game...

Pewds: ok things are happening but whyMe:cause thats how mafia works

My name’s Lily and I’m ashamed.

The best investigation of this century
bro lily&#39;s garden is her <b>******</b>

Love the fact that Felix watches sam o Nella academy

How could my home contry do this

All jokes aside, this oversexualisation is not helping us, nor our children. Look how everyone is obsessed with sexual objectification now. What kind of message that sends? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I no saint, but bit things are going extreme these days. We will continue to objectify people until we change these things. Everything starts at little things. And people should care.

Pewdipe there&#39;s a theory video made by the game theorists aka matpat.

After game theory

The disgusting meme written all over my face

The game itself is good, I’ve been playing it for a long time and I dont watch the ads but  I do enjoy the game, and the story line is cute besides the ads. But my middle name is Lily so that’s why I got it at first. still, I’m glad this got recommended this now out of no where. I love pewds and have been watching him for 10+yrs but I do actually like the game as it is but I agree the ads are major shit btw the ads are nothing compared to the story line in the game lolI play solitaire and two dots more than I play this game but it is top,threeI’m nota Karen I’m just drunk lol sorry 

they should fuck the game and make it a series

Cant we just return to Angry birds and clash of clans

<a href="">0:56</a> my homie outa there

Merge mansion is the new lily’s garden

I love how Felix realized what sexualizing cats and dogs mean and just shifted the topic.

<a href="">9:20</a> Pewds be like: &quot;Ah, yes, lets sexualise cats&quot;

Omg Pewds needs to look at those app games that&#39;s called fashion something that always ends in a fuckup

<a href="">0:00</a> Me when I have to finish my homework

Me, a dane, just taking it in

Lilly&#39;s Garden IŚ weird!
that‘s just because you hate your mum.that&#39;s where all this shit come from

<a href="">7:15</a> KONO DIO DA

Applestore banned poopdie??????

Thats why I like Kitten Match. Its just kittens.

im ashamed of my country to make this

As a somewhat Danish guy, I beg your pardon for what my fellow danish people did.

Does anyone know where I can find a shirt like the one he wears in the Pixelings outro? It looks super cool!

What if you wanted to go to heaven but god said play now

She wanted to get rid of him

That&#39;s why

She slapped her while they were still together

I think the ex-cheating came first then followed up by her faking prego to get rid of him. So the slap is justified :)

Lilys divorce
I love how Sive managed to fit an entire essay about the history of oil and it&#39;s potential uses in two seconds

Yoshikage Kira as Blaine
who is lily and why isnt she in her garden

Does Lily not have any other clothes????

WATCH DANI

<b>h3nt41</b>

ik im late but am i one of the few people who never got this ad? i usually see genshin, ragnarok, or mobile legends

These ads are a disgrace to those who are actually named Lily. U have no idea how uncomfortable it makes me to hear my name for these kind of ads-

Watching this for a second is terrorizing because of the ads

<a href="">0:11</a>

ok

I like how the yellow text for Star Wars is just the Wikipedia for motor oil lol

The blonde hair dude in the ads looks frickin like Jojo

You Singled Out Her <b>Teeth</b> ?Very Reasonability

doesn&#39;t it seem everyone whos name is or is close to lily is a monster?

On behalf of all of Denmark, we would like to apologize...

Lilly is dump

It&#39;s fast-acting detergent.. so it&#39;s Det-Urgent.. I guess?
Lily&#39;s garden is like every Romcom ever that has a twist that doesn&#39;t make since even after they explained it

“Blaine” kinda looks like Jake Paul

i too, hate apple
“We to sexualize all the pixels”-PewDiePie 2020

<a href="">5:05</a> y&#39;know your average family game

No I don’t wanna play Lillys garden I want to torch the creator

What is even lilys garden  .

Mobile adds didnt just cross the line, they did a goddamn backflip over it

Your right you are;D

<a href="">7:48</a> made me spill my drink of laughter xDDD

<a href="">7:54</a> a danish company... i&#39;m danish i feel special now :D
<a href="">4:31</a> and this is why he left you

I love how weird it gets and the play now button is so happy.

Pewds is watching Sam Onella

Why was there two sam,onella vids there

That ad has randomly popped up two times in my life.

Google play has Poopdie

Except lego
As a dane i apologize-

The washine machine part was just--

Rewatch this video, still laughing my ass off on that dorime sounds i dunno why

No no no no no
Wait this video is from 2020?! The meme is true,I did not yet still process 2020

I love his accent so much tho

What he can fly?!?!

<a href="">2:15</a> and like a milli second after Man watches Sam o nella

&quot;Every time Denmark does something they&#39;re up to no good&quot; Lego is actually a weapon disguised as a child&#39;s toy

NO YOU MUST LOVE LILY

<a href="">6:43</a> they have

Lily needs some weeds pulled out from her patch

this entire video made me take 60 points of psychic damage

What if the husband wanted a baby and she faked it hmmmmmmmm 

imagine if this video was sponsored by Lilys Garden

Rrmember Evony?
What the fuck even is this?

Well believe it or not after pewd review the game, it would gains more views and download 

U got away with commenting on the teeth

You got me laughing so hard right now

WHAT!! He can fly!

The first time I read the title I thought it said I <b>ATE</b> her

<a href="">2:58</a> abortion center
I saw the lily&#39;s goddamn garden game on the app store last week

<a href="">7:49</a> The best words

<a href="">2:16</a> pewdiepie watched sam o&#39;nella video
The one who disliked is The Boyfriend In different Accounts

Lmao does anyone else notice that Lily’s mom looks like a hippie ?

<a href="">8:12</a> can you spot the nice?

God to you
I no longer want to be Danish

Anyone else notice Felix has two RedLetterMedia videos in his recommendations? Is it too good to be true that he&#39;s a fan of those hack frauds?

I saw a T-series ad at the start of the video

Me: is named lily*I am extremely uncomfortable with this video

How dare those ads make fun of my name

same

Bad mobile ads everyone speeks like owww woollooooooow a libil fifff geaaa omy good todee weea goner feet a libel fishy oppnint

i’ve watched this video so many times over the last year

Plot twist he did get demonetized for the teeth-shaming

Youtube recommended works in mysterious ways

Just got back from watching all the ads which was thirty minutes long, wow, the content is just wow.....I recommend people give all the ads a watch.

What&#39;s the background music?

I would be so dead if I did that to my mom .

F you sweden

Don&#39;t tell me that the washing machine vibrations are why she rolls her eyes.....or am I tripping.

As far as I understand, you haven&#39;t watched a Pasha Fencer commercial yet.

The mother looks like Yezma’s trying to fit in a video game.

Redlettermedia and Ricky Gervais in your suggested? I thought I was looking at my own suggested for a moment!

there was a Sam O&#39;nella academy video in Pewd&#39;s suggested videos section

At <a href="">3:51</a> WHAT IS THAT

The ads for that game are ridiculous lmao

SH IT

SHIT

The commercial: &quot;The new indie adventure episodic reality drama that&#39;s TOO HOT for T.V!&quot;The game: Ha hA ! bLocKs gO BrrRrrRrrRRrRr

as a dane im actually kinda cringed out that the mail was Danish. Sorry pewds

the &#39;A bitter pill to swallow&#39; video is about drugging drinks. the ex fiance and the mother drug eachothers drinks.

Little dose he know there’s a whole expanded universe

You stole from Peter Knetter

i miss when nintendo would give instruction booklets on the game and it had so much beautiful art in it, it was my favorite thing about getting new gamecube games, i used to have so many.. then i lost them i guess i have no idea, but now those shits are probably priceless artifacts, wish i still had them

Felix called it 12 seconds into the video-

All ads suck tbh except youtuber games it ruins  Crunchyroll b

he said denmark products were bad when denmark made lego

A World War III/war game commercial popped up when the guy kissed Lily’s mother.

If they would not waste their time with a weird game they would have been rich animators.

The ad that was first shown was literally my moms pregnancy in a nutshell

Who wants to live on the earth with Lilly

Awesome

I actually saw Lily’s guarden commercial and was so confused

<a href="">4:30</a> WTF DID I JUST WITNESS

This game is like candy crush

I can&#39;t believe this was a year ago, it feels like it was posted yesterday :(

<a href="">6:00</a>Giggity
Anybody notice how the music is actually from UP

LOL I recently downloaded this game not knowing about these ads and I was telling one of my friends about it and they sent me this video! I had no idea xD really inappropriate ads. Has nothing to do with the game, but the game is entertaining so I&#39;m going to keep playing it.

Lily making ahegao face

I fucking wish Lily&#39;s Garden was like the ads. Would be fucking amazing.

<a href="">4:00</a> please what is the background music

Plot twist: Lily&#39;s name is actually Stacy and that&#39;s why <a href="">2:09</a> happened (Stacy&#39;s Mom)

Make sure to have toilet paper on this date

the washing machine commercial played on my tv

the fuck you said about denmark

I never played Lily&#39;s Garden but those ads made me back away even more.

the ad: betrayal, incest, crazy people, pregnancy, family problems and deathThe game: candy crush

<b>advertises mobile app in 2021</b>

i actually play and like this game  

<a href="">2:47</a>. I can’t stop laughing 

&quot;Look at these creatures teeth. They are so disgusting.&quot;Pewdiepie 2020

To this very day Blaine is still riding his moped

Moral of the story: Everybody hates Lily.

You are in my homework Felix aka PewDiePie

to be taller!
THESE WERE ANIMATED BY THE GUYS THAT MADE THE SUBWAY SURFERS ANIMATIONS AND STUFF MY LIFE IS A LIE

1moth py your paymat
She looks like That Vegan Teacher in her 20s

That&#39;s how mafia works

Mobile legend AD BUT MONEY

Luke looks like Dean from the iron giant

What the fuck is their problem with washing machine

noooo cheems is corrupted

<a href="">2:16</a> felix is watching sam o&#39;nella Academy

One time Google put a VIBRATOR APP in the kids section 

Lol.. pewdiepie... you&#39;re a mood. And I hate to say it, but the ad for idle immortals is worse. It makes it look like it&#39;s an RPG type thing... but its idle... and I unlocked all the creatures within like 2 hours.

Plot twist:The washing machine is the Father

“Why?”

All I want to know is.... Why is this called Lily&#39;s garden?

Word has it Blaine’s still riding to this day.

i hope she gets so pregnant, has several kids, and then can&#39;t keep them or get her exes to help her...

Honestly I’ve been addicted to the damn story and creating the garden but I hate the “game” part. I’ve been wasting hours of my life cus of the unlimited lives I get for more stars to play the story part more

I feel like 0.1% of all mobile games aren&#39;t absolute aids.

Next I have challenge it hard I can’t even do it :(Play Lily’s garbage I mean garden

That first lily ad was so weird like the dad just left instantly

It&#39;s weird that the add don&#39;t even relate anything to the game

i just realized pewds never says were about to reach a milestone cuz he already has like 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 subs good job pewds (p.s.imma sub)

HHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

ive seen this ad so much but sometimes lily is a blonde

<a href="">6:07</a> im so evil and not innocent i immediately understood what lily meant<b>send help</b>

Was that fucking Sam’o Nella in his YouTube feed?!<b>ah, i see you are a man of culture as well</b>

She was enjoying her vibrations

<a href="">7:59</a> well in my chinese class this one kid from Denmark said the chinese rap = c-rap to my teacher so

lily looks like a young vegan teacher
I JUST SAW THAT LILY&#39;S GARDEN AD GOD THE CREATOR GIVED UP ABOUT IN THIS GAME

it give me garden scapes vibes
Raid Shadow Legends more like Paid Shadow Legends

when he say &quot;stop it &quot;me: GeT sOmE hEleP

He has the same bottle as me

I payed more attention to the video&#39;s title than the actual content because it made me laugh so hard

<b>Legends say Blaine is still riding on the moped..</b>

Evreone haets Lilys  garden
Lily

They changed that first ad for the game that was shown. The husband no longer GTFOs. He stays to help her now and looks very different too. I think they just got rid of Blaine and replaced him with Luke altogether.

Everywhere I go I still see it

I love dark humor suffer lily haha

<a href="">3:37</a> even if she did pretend to be pregnant to get rid of him, that would mean the mom would be cheating on her dad

<a href="">7:55</a> i am betrayed by my fatherland

I watched a compilation on every ad in order of lily&#39;s garden.  It was a rollercoaster, but I have to say that it was interesting

<a href="">0:11</a> Dorime in Vocaloid

I&#39;ve seen these before and thought the same thing. It&#39;s fucking strange, man.

Why does every woman in this AD has massive body parts????

I’m playing this game right now and it’s nothing like the ads

no break: sleepbreak: awoken

These are not ads,these are aids.

Me: <b>Downloads Lily&#39;s Garden For The Drama, Fun And Pregnancy.</b>Also Me: <b>gets frickin bejeweled</b>

Pls guys don&#39;t say Omg,Jesus Christ as a shock word pls guys 

I personally like this version of pewds

<a href="">2:10</a> Kira Yoshikage Jotaro father!

Hello Russians!
I really hate that game

L... lillililllillyyyyyy
And I dont know why it has a rating of 4.6 on Google Play... 

I didn't understand shit but yeah.
I’m legit watching this at 4am

Did you just say that denmark does shitThey invented Legos keep that on mind

When you realize the washer vibrates... I am scared! No, I misspelled, scarred!

very toxic
You got ad-baited
<a href="">9:23</a> jojo reference?
The gameplay reminds me of shitscapes

Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of this video. It definitely deserves a sequel to Pewdiepie&#39;s reaction to Lilys Garden ads because even more keep popping up.

i don&#39;t like Lily

Dorime
dorime is just like friday funkin

Gardenscapes: <b>&quot;First time?&quot;</b>
This kind of ad remind me of Homescapes ad  and those annoying game ads where they purposely pick the wrong option

when lily reveals that she faked the pregnancy test That&#39;s how mafia works

Yes  i would love to play in lily&#39;s garden and explore even more

Yup we out 

Well we made lego
When u buy a new pc from ebay <a href="">4:28</a>

Top 3 Things I Hate1: Ice Age Baby2: Lily’s Garden 3: garden scapes

Ha Danny Gonzalez would be proud

Lily is a-

Lily fu!!!

I hope they make an ad where Lily gets hit by a car and then the driver reverses over her already broken legs damaging them even more.

I see NTR reference ( ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)
<a href="">7:57</a> me a Dane crying in the background

My favourite one is the pregnant one

My rain after I watched that video: this is how mafia works

the ads are better than the game ;-;

Wait it&#39;s all memes

September

Proper Arabfunny meme at the beginningVery epic

My name is lily and I’m slightly uncomfortable

And you have not even seen the Dutch ads..

Got a Mobile Game Ad while watching this vid

Regina in indonesia was some kind of chips

2080:And here, children, is Lily&#39;s Garden one of the first ocurances to trigger the end of the world.

So cringe!!!!!!!!!!
i laughed when her husband left

<a href="">2:15</a> thats a lot of samonella

:0

Reminds me of Charlie

As a Danish person i will truly apologize for this mess

I’m danish and i now have a plan for immigration

The ads are more interesting than the actual game

Noo poopdie :c
I am from Denmark and i agree that this game is nut nuts, but you have to remember that, Denmark also envented hit man.

This gives out critikal vibes and i luv it

dis video is epic as hell

<a href="">0:25</a> seems like a twomad edit

Can’t believe this was almost a year ago

But seriously  she looked like she peed herself on the washing machine.

Invite  my friends to sit on a washing machine and then fall in love with my neighbor great choices and then slap my mom for making out with my ex husband I am just so smart .

i am disappointed of my country

That game has the same ads that doesn&#39;t related to the game of Homescape and Gardenscapes I think. Because the game is same gardening stuffs. 

Wow, Felix is a wee lil&#39; bit salty than usual, <i>innit</i> huh?

pause at <a href="">2:16</a> and it shows that Sam O&#39;Nella Academy videos are in pewd&#39;s reccomended

Ever heard of merge gun: shoot zombie
Pewds not picking up the pun for &quot;DET Urgent&quot; to now making dad jokes during Among Us is the character development I needed

I&#39;m like a 7th graders and the adverts  that I get on flipaclip are uncomfortable :(

I feel like this is false advertisement but then again I don’t know

One day my friend ate a erraser
As a Lili we do not acept herActualy im a &#39;Lili&#39; not a &#39;Lily&#39;

The pregnancy scene where lily was talking I tried to read her lips and she was saying &quot;ilk tuat&quot; LOLEdit: <a href="">3:14</a>

That&#39;s How Mafia Works!If you remember you are a legend!

WAIT WHAT IT&#39;S DANISH XD HVORFOR DANMARK HVORFOR!!

Even pewdiepie agrees lol
lily&#39;s garden is CRINGE
I love this guy

But u played game
Eww. (That&#39;s disgusting.The whole. &#39;Lily&#39;s garden&#39; is disgusting.)

I didnt know such cringe could exist

THERE&#39;S NO SHAKING OF VEGANA

Top 10 best animes ever

Got a mobile ad

What a disgrace to my name wtf

how is that 10 months ago? wtf

some guy:is this before or after her pregnancyme:damn

All the Lily&#39;s Garden ads actually have a YouTube channel...

You should play sky children of the light, it’s made by the same people who made Journey. It’s 

Monke

The ad where the guy is driving away on the scooter is the story of my life 

the times he was still funny

I found a copy of this ad by a norher game

<a href="">2:31</a> what tf is the name of that song I hear it everywhere

olppollloolollloo

About: I make videos. Okay... I need more content..

I just got here after watching dani&#39;s video on the same topic

My mom played the game Lilly&#39;s garden and she didnt know about the ad qnd she hasn&#39;t played the game ever since she saw the ad

They should just make the game episodic or make an animated YouTube series 

Lily be high

My mum plays Lily&#39;s Garden... I just realised...

Lily&#39;s husband looks like yoshikage kira from jjba diu

PewDiePie oye
why is this a game

Woman pleasing herself with a washing machine, this is how you know a man did this

They actually re-did that &quot;I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; scene twice, one with Lily&#39;s female friends and one with that neighbour dude. XDI&#39;ve seen the full story so far and everybody literally just cheat on everybody, it&#39;s so bizarre and it makes no sense. Also the mother dies and then returns after that? And Lily has a kid with demonic powers???

When yr name Whitney is on lily&#39;s garden why meeeee!!!

lily would make a lot of money if she had an onlyfans lmao

<b>family friendly</b><a href="">5:13</a> ye sure

<a href="">0:56</a> ight imma head out.

This vid is random AF but I can relate 100 percent lily&#39;s garden is trash

And then there’s the commercial where Lilly kills her husband because he likes ketchup and snores

<a href="">2:24</a> this make me laugh all video

a

Pewds: Lily&#39;s a f**king <b>WE&#39;LL BE RIGHT BACK...</b>

Wth did I just watchYou earned a sub

Hahahhaha

Hahaha

Why are 90% of mobile games just the same game??

Bruh what are these ads?? The memes added to these ads make it even more funnier.Thanks Sive (Brad 2)

The way the guy drives away the scooter is hilarious 

My mother loves Lilys garden XD.

i don’t get the washing machine ad can somebody tell me what it meand

Having played the actual game [using a hacked APK to skip the bejweled knockoff and just watch the story segments/play the decorating games] I gotta say the story was kind of cute and heartwarming.

THANK YOU I HATE HER TOO

<a href="">6:32</a>  lol the video got demonnetized

Next ad be likeWhat she get washing machine baby

Just look at the American lubatv lol
As a Dane I apologize for this🇩🇰

Okej, I admit to playing this game and single mindedly paying some google minions salary. Why? Because, like all these poker machine games. They Are Addicting. Also you get to make a &quot;garden&quot;.  *face palm*... Don&#39;t be fooled either by the &quot;traditional&quot; advertising or even &quot;sexualising&quot; .. Because the game &quot;storylines&quot; are woke, woken? Fts. Game no likey boys, their germy and Conan style intelligent... Which is why I skip any story to fund the minion.... Who now apparently is my neighbour.... 

Are we not gonna talk about the ones where she murders people and buries them in her garden

Game: lilys gardenMe: lilys garbage...
HONK

Where&#39;s the pregnancy!?

That ad is so much worst than mobile legends ads

Dorime
<a href="">4:30</a> WTF

the four thousand dislikes are the game owners

<a href="">3:48</a> WHAT IS THAT IN THE BACKROUND O.O

Last night I downloaded a game about texting. You&#39;d expect it to be just sending fake texts to people. But no, it also includes minigames of fixing a phone, and pulling pins so all the emojis end up in a container. Those minigames I mentioned have their own games all about their respective premise.

Omg I&#39;m dead
I hate cell phone game advertisements so bullshit much hatred

<a href="">8:24</a> he’s kinda bad
When I sawed that at <a href="">4:25</a>  then kept watching and what&#39;s this it&#39;s family friendly I just pursted into tears with laughter

We all know what garden she is growin and its not for 4+

<a href="">2:59</a> Every woman after 2 days of dating.

Why are all the newer games just rip offs of candy crush with sims building shit for flavourEdit: and random sex jokes and shit while being promoted as FAMILY FRIENDLY

Petition for Pewds to play Lilly&#39;s garden so we can kill it completely.

Hey your are the bested youtuber in the world you are god to me I praise you

My mom is on like level 2000 on this shitty game

this &quot;game&quot; ( maybe ) must to be +30

<a href="">2:14</a> le slap
It&#39;s just Homescapes but crappier... and Homescapes is already CRAPPY!

what about the ad where she legit murders her husband by smothering him

Thanks pewdipie for sharing this commercial Merry christmas 
Legend has it that blaine still mounts the vespa

I saw one advertisement for Lily&#39;s Garden where her husband leaves but comes back with supplies for the baby. That was sweet

Ever game  like this is just candy crush

I am from Denmark, and I apologize for this. I did not like whatever this was, and I think its bad. Just wanted to put that out there.

<a href="">04:39</a> is when I understood why this game scared Pewds lol

IM OFFENDED BY DENMARK

<a href="">3:14</a> Kira is that you

I feel like the creators of Lily&#39;s Garden commercials are just trolling people at this point with how ridiculous their commercials are

Pewds: &quot;Have you ever noticed how crazy things are out there?&quot;Me now: 

I hate Lily’s garden and her teeth too

Im danish and now ashamed of my contry

Pewds: I hate Lily’s garden and her teeth Me: who doesn’t

Gardenscapes is worse i get the fricking add every second and it&#39;s a clickbait

Raid shadow ledgends is frikin evry where

These are the most horrific ads my 11 year old mind has processed

Where&#39;s the garden pary tho call it bad times with lily

Pewdiepie is mean to Denmark and me (But yes danish games are so fuking wierd

I was watching  a yt vid and  saw these adds so many times I deleted yt and reinstalled it

<a href="">0:57</a> when dad goes to get some milk

Mobile game ads in the past: good quality, and trueMobile game ads now: haha ads go brrrr

I want a times lapse of that man riding away

DUDE I GOT THAT AD THE FIRST ONE AND A COPY

Her husband looks like gulman

That Vespa

HOW IS THE GAME FAMILY FRIENDLY, THE AD&#39;S DON&#39;T LOOK FAMILY FRIENDLY.

The ad had nothing to do with the game, and it had nothing to do with a garden, I&#39;m confused.

Me: trys to find video that was on also the videoAlso me: proceeds to see video right next to the videoIm not sure this meme made sence

This is cursed

Lilypichu be crazy

I think I literally contracted autism from watching those ads

i cant read coments bc im laufing too herd-hard

I got a really bad ad and thought it was part of the video.

The one kid that installed Lilly’s garden 

Who is watching this 6 months after it was published lmao

If she can do that with a washing machine... don’t give here a smart fridge.

That Chad that got lily pregnant did a Jojo reference

So.. not gonna lie.. this game is actually kinda fun. Roast me if you must. 

Danny Gonzalez is going to be so mad

We are not talking about vodoos terible ads?Or is it just Asian?Also mobile legends terrible ads

The washing machine one has me FUCKED UP I laughed for over five minutes

my mom better play Bubble Shooter than Lily&#39;s Garden.

U are right about the first one

Blaine looks like the Chad meme

The ad I saw for this game was the one where she finds out she&#39;s pregnant, tells her fiance. EXCEPT!!! It&#39;s not the blonde guy she tells it too, its they dark haired guy she tells the news to. And instead o driving off on a vespa and leaving her, and steps out for a moment, then comes back with gifts for her.

Wait dis game is danish o fuck I’m danish ahhhh my future is coomin

I got an ad were she freaken killed that luke guy with a pillow just because he put ketchup in his dinner and left the restroom cabin sloppy and then she upgrade her house and whatever

The gameplay is like gardenscape lol,and gardenscape maybe the ad is trash but (in the game there is minigame like the ad) the game is good my dad in gardenscape is 6000,so the game is consisten,and i&#39;m not  a bot guys,and i&#39;m not advertising the game

Legends says blaine is still riding the vespa

This is not family game

Felix: Have you noticed that its gotten crazier out thereMe: <b>looks at date of upload</b> Jan 13 2020Also me: Thats just the beginning

The game is a match game with a story line. The game is g rated.  The ads.... hilarious...but the ads are PG-13.

Blaine is like a roach....he won&#39;t go away... You have to tell him to go away like 10 times in the game...and he still shows back up. Haha

The game is actually pretty cool....and addictive.

Did I just get a PewDiePie ad on a PewDiePie video? Yes I did
I got a pewds phone case ad while watching this

Scam

Ugh

<b>i got a pewdiepie ad before this, i didn&#39;t hesitate to stay</b>

Did Felix just say “sexy angry birds”?

I missed this kind of pewdiepie, he looks like a pancake now

Felix clearly salty tryna play it off

I got the pewdiepie game add while watching this lol

Wtf. Seriously...

Hello, I'm Mr. Bolainas.
<a href="">3:15</a> I seen this one but the ad was cut out and she was in the hospital and randomly was at her house decorating her house

Did lily just get off on the washing machine?

I would like to provide an update: Lily and Luke do in fact have a child now. I believe the kid was born two weeks ago as of the time I am writing this.

I actually played the game, and I skipped through the intro. Never knew there was this much back story. Wouldn&#39;t have skipped it 

Where does the “garden” part come??Or is this game just “Lily’s love life for four year olds”

So uh... where&#39;s the freaking garden???

Lily&#39;s Garden is literally the most pathetic and hateful crap I have ever seen. Even this &#39;&#39;intro&#39;&#39; they&#39;ve did for the characters is literally bad, at this point just do a actual game that looks like your fucking ads, jeez.Plus the original game is a whole boring mess, and ALSO rated 4+, how they come with these stupid ads while profiting from a &#39;&#39;friendly reputation&#39;&#39; on Google Play. Honestly Google?...

I see too many Lily&#39;s ads. And I hate it

Yes I will trick my husband  that I’m pregnant and then get mad that he dated my mom and it is weird as f&amp;@k wen they sit on the dryers

<a href="">8:10</a> They’re not just telling stories, they’re changing lives

In the washing machine part I accidentally clicked off of youtube.

It should&#39;ve been Karen&#39;s Garden so it would rhyme. Also, she took the kids.

Pewdiepie you have to respect women

<b>I hate this god damn crappy lily&#39;s garden game</b>

Why does podipie look different here

Why didn&#39;t they just make it a YouTube series of episodes instead of having the game

&quot;wHERE&#39;S THE PREGNANCY???&quot;

Why have I never seen these ads? I actually play this game and it&#39;s  really lame. Not at all as spicy as these ads are. I wish it did have all the betrayal and pregnancy etc.   But no, just a lame strategy game.

btw on behalf of all danish people: wtf

I dont get it.. The game is named Lilys Garden, have absolutely nothing to do with gardens as its bejewled game, and the trailers have nothing to do with either of that too ?

<a href="">2:35</a> ...

That Advertisement Is Same Powered In Rick Roll

Well I didn&#39;t know about this shit until now so thank you pewds for ruinning my day

The door
I saw the add follow up first, and I was like:

ADVERT REVIEW

<a href="">2:30</a> where can I find that song in the background

when he says denmark in his videos and ur danish :,)

Why need a boyfriend when you can get a washing machine?

Play Lily’s <i>garden</i> if you know what I mean

🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵@# brofist
One day I just think of this video randomly but I remember the title as &quot;I hate Lily Teeth and her Garden&quot;

On behalf of the Lily community, WE DON&#39;T CLAIM HER

I’m starting to think they’re making their ads shit unpurpose so that youtubers will react to them and thereby give their game more attention and more potential customers. The old “all publicity is good publicity” accept theyre just making bad ads and not doing anything immorally

If you didn&#39;t notice it already blaire looks like he&#39;s holding air on the motor cycle

It’s dark web ads
<a href="">0:55</a> can’t have crap in Detroit

I instinctively tried to skip the ad PewDiePie was watching

You have the same water bottle as my uncle

Lily&#39;s husband reminds me of Kira Yoshikage.

<a href="">0:57</a> I fuckin died laughing at the guy on the moped,he left with nothing dude he straight said &quot;fuck it,I&#39;m out&quot; and DIPPED LMAO!!!

The ads tho

I’ll rest in Denmark :’)

<a href="">0:11</a> d o r I m e

<a href="">7:46</a> kiss the glass and the beer in your hand so that she is lucky and she kissed 2

Lily&#39;s Garden seems like it wants to be a playable sitcom and I&#39;m here just asking WHY

<a href="">8:00</a> name of the background song, please

<a href="">8:00</a> name of the background song, please

<a href="">8:00</a> name of the background song, please

PewDiePie don&#39;t say u hate someone, your fans are gonna literally kill them

uhm.. MY MOTHER PLAYS THAT GAME
<a href="">0:11</a>

Bruh

I want pixelings and will never play anything else EVER

I want pixelings and will never play anything else EVER

<a href="">2:16</a> pewdiepie x sam o&#39;nellaI saw 1 frame of it

I guess all advertising Is good advertising

19 year olds are 4+

Ah yes, when times were simpler (even tho it was just a few months ago)

Bitch lily: <b>doing yoga</b>Guy stops by:Lily: <b>ses hes butt</b> Also lily: <b>Suprised pikachu face</b>

Pathetic I hate her and her <b>gums</b>

They used a washing machine as a vibrator.

When pewds said, it&#39;s a Danish company, I immediately got a cinnamon roll ad,  just thought it was ironic

<a href="">4:37</a> voice crack
<a href="">3:08</a> Backlash because fathers who yeet themselves are not cool

I was almost called Lily but my dad was like “No, let’s call her Lucy!” Or something along those lines....

Hey. I’m danish.
i got a pewdiepie&#39;s tuber simulator ad on this video

In finland its &quot;joka kerta kun ruotsalaiset tekee jotain se on jotain homoa&quot;Translated &quot;everytime swedes makes something its gay&quot;

Thank you for the video, everything is very clear!
This is on par with car commercials with weird shit happen, while it has nothing to do with the car being advertised

I’ve seen the Lily’s ads a lot kinda getting annoyed by it.

<a href="">0:10</a> <a href="">0:11</a>

It’s a good thing I don’t have a garden. (check the name!)

When you said it was danish i literally spit out the water i was drinking, wtf i&#39;m disappointed in my own country&#39;s people

w e l l -
my name is Lily! 
<a href="">4:34</a> LMFAO

This was this year! This feels so old

I watched the bitter pill to swallow ad, and it&#39;s about date rape drugs. But hey, 4+ family game!!

When i was watching i got a ad a bull driving over a bull good job youtube

Was that a Sam O’Nella video I saw in your recommendations?

lily: <i>i’m pregnant</i>blaine: <b>aight imma head out</b>
On behalf of the Danish 19 year old, we are sorry for what our country have done.

Pewdiepie watches Sam O&#39;Nella Academy
“Denmark is always up to no good” no wonder LEGO hurts to step on

The 3D models look like they’re from a 3ds game

<a href="">7:47</a> hahaha XD omg pewds hahah
I watched the ads for the game and there are so horrible!

All games ads lie and will never stop lying And will lie forever!

Mobile ads will never stop getting worst and more annoying!

TRUE

YOU HATE LILY AND HER <b>TEETH</b> OMG INTENSE <b>HATE</b> BIG <b>MAD</b>

that beginning video game we call legacy of discord, i recommend it

Maybe the mom incident was before the pregnancy incident?

<a href="">7:58</a> I&#39;M FROM DENMARK 🇩🇰Jeg er fra Danmarkwe have made the LEGO!VI har lavet lego

Lily is a lesbian

Lily&#39;s garden: makes ad.                          Memers: hold my beer

<a href="">3:02</a> I swear I choked on my drink lmao

When I found out that this game was developed by a danish company, my inner dane threw up

It&#39;s basically cliakbait

She&#39;s pregnant with a dishwasher

I just realized lily&#39;s garden is a ripoff of gardenscapes which is a ripoff of candy crush

If this was about pizza, they would still be together cuz he just drove away for a pizza party:b GET SOME FACTS BOII

Scp-Pewdiepie
I don’t get it
As a criminal case player I see this ad every day

<a href="">0:20</a> thats equivalent to saying minecraft is cubical

Who would’ve thought that a cheap puzzle game to lead to incest, fake pregnancy, Jeremy Kyle and dr Phil material.

I think they&#39;re making more adds on lily&#39;s garden bc many people watch it

omaigoid yeshHate her

Vibrator.

Legend says blane is still riding on that moped

Poopdie is back on the App Store

<a href="">7:22</a> look what happnes to lilys body

My mom play Lily’s garden
<b><i>washing machine</i></b>

Speaking of Lily&#39;s Garden, I saw a commercial for it on t.v. I was.... Certainly not expecting it.

<b>Im pregnant</b>Husband: Aight imma head out

Yes we danes are crazy

I really dodged a bullet because my name is Lilly (it’s actually Lillian but people call me Lilly)

What&#39;s funny is that the ORIGINAL ad was that the dad came back with a baby sized shirt

&quot;It&#39;s like watching the latest Star Wars film. Ok, things are happening, but WHY?&quot; This is the best description of the new Star Wars films

WHAT HE CAN FLY? Wow this is Assisin

Who knew sitting on a washing machine can make you so powerful

It’s f*ucking cocomellon

I’m tired of raid shadow legends. I downloaded it and it wasn’t even good. The graphics are okay but the gameplay is boring.

Lily has made videos

Lily: I&#39;m pregnantBlaine: haha vespa go brrr
That ‘dorime’ transition was so clean.

Bruh
Lily probably grows weed or something.

<a href="">2:42</a> leaving this for me.Freaking love this.<b>w h e r e ‘ s  t h e  p r e g n a n c y ! ?</b>

Dorime. Interimo Adapare, dorime.
lily&#39;s husband be looking like <b>giorno giovonna</b>torture dance: <a href="">6:00</a>
<a href="">0:55</a> Is this Kira Yoshikage i am very confused

ngl literally teared at these lily gardens ads xd

I&#39;ve actually never seen a lily&#39;s garden ad :/

Just look up &quot;Lilly&#39;s Garden - Too spicy for the pepper!&quot;-I&#39;m very disappointed...

<a href="">0:56</a> i don&#39;t know why but i can&#39;t stop laughing

Why hate her teeth

yesterday i was playing Subway Surfers and there was a video we’re Lily KILLS Luke (the “neighbor”)

I also hate teeth

<b>The title made me use the ugly laughing faces</b> 

Lily has big vs

When lily gets pregnant after the washing machine incident, she says &quot;dan, this is your father!&quot; <del>washing machine intensifies</del>

I

he should see it rn

Pewds: I will sexualise all of my pixelings.Marzia’s simps: YES YES  YES  YES YESY E S

<a href="">3:28</a> bruh where are the tears? She wasn’t even crying

The newest one is Lily lying in her bed, calling someone

Pewdiepie watches sam&#39;onella?
Poor lily. I swear to god, if you don’t apologise, I will unsubscribe to you and sub TsERieS

My mom is playing Lily&#39;s garden and he is more than level 180. Disturbing

They look a bit too calm on the washing machine for a family game

Is it just me? Or the Mom in Cocomelon and Lily are like the same(?)

<a href="">5:28</a> No, I look like I am trying to squeeze out a turd, because I am.

Kissing scene of me and my crush:Expectation: <a href="">7:41</a>Reality: <a href="">7:39</a>

It&#39;s like if HuniePop <b>tried</b> to be family friendly.

Everybody gangsta until her husband drive away

The washing machine scene wth

Is it just me, or is there a hand moving in the background? 

WTF this game is Job of satan

I hate this boring games -_-

Was that sam o nella in his recommended?

Regina means Queen in Romania

I literally saw Lily&#39;s Garden for the 1st time and got so fucked up in the head filled with anger, cringe, and laughter.

I played it before seeing the ad. The soap opera-esk ads have NOTHING to do with the game&#39;s story.

Hey, I'm Danish
Hey I&#39;m danish
Wth. This is a kids game! Omgggg she literary. Omg. Ah.

<a href="">5:08</a> was the very first ad I saw for this fucking game when I was playing Empires and Puzzles or something, and I couldn&#39;t help but be like: What the fuuuuck?? Now all I see is the pregnancy announcement with Luke.

something tells me Denmark is celling gang

Felix, I do not accept your apology. It&#39;s a fucking match 3 game which advertises Lily herself forcefully trapping a child in the dryer and turns it on to max. AND SHE SMILES, SHE THROWS UP A BIG OL&#39; GRIN WHILE THE CHILD IS MOST LIKELY CRYING FOR MERCY!(Edit: AND GETTING A KINK OUT OF IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!)

I played poopdie and it hud

<a href="">0:20</a>Wow he’s flying

Bejewelled: How dare you disrespect me like this

<a href="">0:11</a> Dorimeitzeemohrataparaedorimeamumuamenoratedaelateedaemoedorimeamenoolmenadepadariamenodimedae
<a href="">1:35</a> why does he look like Yoshukage Kira from &quot;JoJo&#39;s Bizzare Adventure&quot; lol.

E

what the hell is the timeline

Was that miku dorime in the beginning?????

I&#39;d like to share that I got an ad for Raid Shadow Ledgends...

 lol  idk why but this is funny 

My mom plays lily&#39;s garden seriously bruh she is at like level 800 or smth im this close to showing her the ads

I&#39;m such a weird die hard fan of these ads

Anyone named Lily comment down below I wanna hear ur apologies on behalf of being a lily

Lily Stellmacher as someone with the last name Roberts I would also like to personally apologize

lilly: no no no blaine small PP, luke big PPapple: this is VERY age 4+ content, who doesnt want to talk about doing naugthy things?

ok so she is pregnant then she tells hen divorce cuz baby and then sad but what as that to do with the app?!

heh.

Plot twist: this video is a add for Lily’s garden

As a dane i would like to apologise for lilys existence

Wtf lol

Agreed, all mobile ads (except for pewdiepie’s games) need to be stopped

Waa

When i was watching i asked myself how da fak people get this in their ads that is impossibleAnd here i am i get this fricking ad now

Raid would love to get a sponsership with you

4+ family game and one ad has her very obviously signaling how her exs goncho is small and her neighbors is longer than the width of an average human... Like wtf

I am so flippin ashamed to be a dane

Kira yoshikage leaving Lily will always bring a smile to my face 

Why

When she sat on the washing machine and made that fckn face I almost dropped my phone in astonishment

Whitney as Whitney

I GOT A PREGNANCY TEST AD IM SHOOKMAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

<a href="">2:15</a> I smell sam'o'nella
Bad game

Literally my favorite part of the vid Dorime

Pewds then: &quot;They are tricking the 4 year olds!&quot;Pewds now: (Plays Cocomelon intro before every video)
