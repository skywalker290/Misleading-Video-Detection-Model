Disney We Want MALEFiCENT 3.

I hope Disney make a spin off movie of the Dark Fey, about their root, history and origin. I found really interesting how they divided into 4 different realms based on bioma. We want more stories about Maleficent with her kind Dark Fey!!!

Why is Maleficent turned into a sort of good guy in these movies,  she was the bad guy in the original fairytale

My favourite film of disney

Offensive to the original glad it flopped

I liked both parts of the movie

From the trailer the movie looks soooo awfully boring. I just can&#39;t force myself to watch it even if it seems to have positive opinions

Its connected to sleeping beauty.

Amazing movie...Truly masterpiece19 july 2023

She&#39;s Mona Lisa.
2020 Disney movie on DVD I watched the sequel to the villain fantasy magic movie
movi name plj

back when Disney made good films.

Hello aurora doesnt tell about her crush to her mother and the mother never loved her also the mother always mad at her because the baby get something different since she was born. — aurora is the prettiest girl, and she said &quot; U are my real mother &quot;I don&#39;t know about the POV but this cool movie that i&#39;ve ever watched

Yall aurora is angelina jolies daughter vivian

The maleficent movies are still my favorite live action retellings ❤

what&#39;s the song at <a href="">1:57</a>?

i&#39;ve heard about this

So excited to see thisss😮😮❤🎉

Great movie, just like the first one.

Best movie ever
Please upload this movie full

My only issue is that it&#39;s claiming to re-write Sleeping Beauty. Why not be alternative timeline where factors of Sleeping Beauty were alterd. The story is great but what it&#39;s attached to is what keeps some people negative or avoid the film completely.

3rd part loading Disney..?
No matter what u read in reviews this movie is absolutely great 1st and 2nd one!... love it

Disney&#39;s maleficent: mistress of evil

They named it wrong, the original name of this movie is: Horned Gara Garı
👍👍Angelina ❤️
Love it skskskkskssj

What happened to Aurora? Love gets you nothing. Many gave up when children started dying, no report back from the Parents. Matilda should open her arms to her sisters, at least Fiona stayed as a dragon

So Maleficent is female giga chad

i thought it was rated pg-13 😡

I Can&#39;t Wait For Maleficent 3 Mother Of All Fairies

Dharma or adharma

Continue your witch craft let&#39;s see which one wins

Shown in:The Lion King IT: Chapter 2Hustlers The Addams Family

Angry Birds Movie 2 and Abominable AMC theater

95% this movie is about love, from mother to daughter ♥️

Good adventure movie
While love makes you weak, hatred gives you the strength to face everything.

DON&#39;T RUIN MY MORNING😈😎😂👊💪
WELL WELL😍😎💪😈😂
Not as good as the first unfortunately. Felt very thrown together and random.

Imagineers, you should create Maleficent 3 - In 2015, I went a guest in the Disneyland Paris I didn&#39;t see anything about Maleficent I was so disappointed 😞 when I win wings again I am planning to visit at Disneyland in USA at the moment only birds can travel around the world 🌎. I believe you should ask team Imagineers of  Randy Paush in Carnegie Mellon University when You decide to create Maleficent 3

Amazing movie with great actorsEspecially Elle Fanning

Sleeping beauty?
Please movie name

Disneyland

Angelina Jolie admitted that she still has the pair of horns at home.Angelina Jolie herself picked Lana Del Rey to sing Sleeping Beauty (1959)&#39;s &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; for the end credits.Maleficent&#39;s magic changes colour. When she is good, her magic is gold and when she is evil, her magic is green.Diaval&#39;s make-up (in human form) consisted of &quot;crow&#39;s feet&quot; on his face and bodyAll the actors and actresses in Maleficent were partly chosen to be in the movie based on their uncanny resemblances and/or likeness to their respective character counterparts in Disney&#39;s Sleeping Beauty (1959).For Maleficent&#39;s horns, Angelina Jolie wore several headpieces with different weights. One headpiece was so heavy that Angelina would have neck pains right after and therefore was not appropriate for her more physically intensive scenes, such as her flight and battle scenes.Maleficent is a fairy but notably resembles more of a harpy, the hybrid, winged creature from the Greek and Roman mythologies with the parts of a woman and a bird.The last major film of special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. After this film, he retired from the industry in 2015 due to lack of good work.Maleficent&#39;s prosthetics and make-up were inspired by singer Lady Gaga, particularly on her &quot;Born This Way&quot; album cover.Angelina Jolie&#39;s Disney debut.The film&#39;s cast includes one Oscar winner: Angelina Jolie; and two Oscar nominees: Imelda Staunton and Lesley Manville.Pax Jolie-Pitt, Zahara Jolie-Pitt: Angelina Jolie&#39;s children appear briefly, cowering in fear of Maleficent during the christening scene.The name &quot;Maleficent&quot; is derived from Latin and literally means &quot;evil doer&quot;. There is no reason given in the film for Maleficent, as a young, good fairy, to have such a name. When she does start to become destructive, the name matches.

The fairy Maleficent - as a warlock who not only channeled natural disorderly powers, but raised hell&#39;s forces - is a necromancer as a warlock - Blizzard Entertainment need not use a company&#39;s characters.

Thanks madam Maleficient👹💫 🙏🏿😭Special for you, choose 5 my products
Beautiful

That is a movie from Disney plus!! Of maleficent 2 mistress of evil 2019,11. I like that new Netflix!! Original, family movie of the black Cauldron , the spiderwick chronicles and the Huntsman!! Part 2 winter war.

Maleficent loves aurora she take care of her like her own daughter even if she is evil maleficent is the best she us savage cool solo

I can&#39;t believe Aurora is stupid and  weak-minded like this, killing and endangering her magnificent mother because of that  guy. if I were maleficent I would never forgive her

Is it just me who thinks that diaval and aurora should&#39;ve ended up together? Because like in the first movie prince Philip&#39;s kiss didn&#39;t wake aurora it was maleficent&#39;s true love&#39;s kiss. Plus in the movie it shows how caring diaval is towards aurora

I want a part 3 Maleficent:The Daughter Of Aurora

COOL

Phillip should have brown contact lenses since he had brown eyes in the first film/movie. In this film/movie he has blue eyes.

Am impressed on how Diaval,aurora,maleficent,and the 3 fairy&#39;s, they still look the same after 5 years.

Now it&#39;s time to care for your own

There is no union there will be no wedding. Well well

Love doesn&#39;t always end well besty

Update: it’s just been announced by Disney that a third film is currently in Development

I don't know what the fuck Cruella is. If she is a whore, she is your bitch Eve, not Lilith!
it was kindness and love which betrayed maleficent

Ryan can you tell this people that I was the one doing this for 25 years, that you don&#39;t have no access to digitally producing. Maybe like that they will understand and you can go on with your life and your Dominican mistress and i can go on with mines. This production is the only thing uniting us. Cut the leash.

And then...once upon a time...it never happened !! For Digital Productions, Visual Effects and Engineering, please pay accordingly. Thank You. Sincerely yours... Princess Aracely Martinez...the one and only.

Well Well

&quot;well, well&quot; has always been iconic, STAN <b>QUEEN ANGELINA JOLIE</b>

Aurora pissed me off in this movie. She was acting so dumb and it was triggering me. First she invited her mom to the dinner knowing that the mom of the prince didnt even like her , how did she not know it was a trap ... Then she betrayed her and was easily brainwashed &amp; Almost got her killed because she wanted to not pay attention and be dumb.

this is the best movie everyone should watch it as it shows the true meaning of love. Love is the most beautiful thing in this whole world but true and pure love is very difficult to find, and it also show that love is not something which is only between man and women, It can be between a mother and daughter, it is something that make you care for the other person, protect them from this cruel world and love them till the end. ❤️

The trailer revealed too much

My last movie in Theatre before Pandemic. This was the last movie which I watched in the theatre, don&#39;t know when the theatre will open. Now Disney Hotstar is the best place to get all these movies.

Aurora is just annoying!!!! I hope later more focus on maleficent more focus to her happiness

crazy movie
I truly don&#39;t understand the horrible critics reviews on this movie. I enjoyed ever passing second. From the anger from conflict to the worry of constant danger to the sadness of loss to the relief of happiness and contentment. I felt it all. Of course there were parts where the movie was rather silly but again this movie a disney one, it&#39;s meant for all ages bht tailored carefully for its younger audience. Truly a masterpiece.

Please Dubb the maleficent movie 2014 in hindi.

Are there any Arabs? 😢😭😩
Hi disney can i invest my stories in disney please say yes

I couldn’t believe it’s already been 3 years. Felt like we just watched it in the theaters yesterday.

Music?

This was actually a great movie lol, was not expecting to enjoy watching it so much. Was also lowkey dark and violent? Like people were dying left and right throughout the whole movie 😂. And the whole locked chapel scene with the moors being attacked was actually so dark lol. Did not expect that from disney, and honestly it’s what makes the movie that much more enjoyable. Loved how much lore is added and how it connected to the original sleeping beauty. With how much action and fighting happened, the ~2 hour movie passed by quick!

At first Disney only showed typical princess movies but now it&#39;s improving and this one was the best ever

When will you come please?

I wasted 2 hours in my life after watching this movie

Yeah this is the last movie to watch at the movie theater before Covid-19 Hopefully I can come to the movie theater again this year or next year...

I love her

I can just imagine Jannah , imagine how beautiful that would be

Go beyond the fary tale. You do not know ME

Well well

Don&#39;t ruin my morning
I kinda feel disappointed with this. Many lost their lives to the war, and a lot of things to consider and then Maleficent just turned away with that in an instant and then boom, happy ending. Not to mention the Kingdom massacred the fairies, lock them up in a cathedral as they disappear one by one and then we just got a lighthearted ending. It’s more favorable to me if yes, let’s say Maleficent forgave them (in the blink of an eye lol) but she realized that because of that, humans and fairies can’t really co-exist and she part ways with Aurora for eternity. Idk, because of the plot structure, this should have at least an ending similar to this.

Angelina Jolie is the best actor for Maleficent because her accent is so AWESOME for Maleficent’ voice!!!!

I really love only maleficent role love you maleficent 😍😍😍😘❤

Are Disney in a woke-war against men? After this film i&#39;m not longer in doubt.I just saw the sequel to &quot;Maleficent&quot; with Angelina Jolie. In fact, a Disney movie coined for children. No man has a role of significance in the film. The men who are there must find themselves playing supporting roles; weak, worthless or unconscious (literally, the king lies in a coma through most of the film). Women are the strongest forces, on both sides. The Queen, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, spins a plot so viciously that I think no man could make it up. But who executes her orders? Armies of men. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see an army of women led by a man. But the opposite is obviously not only accepted, but desirable. Also this message is clear; men get to find themselves in women at the top!It is also the men who have to pay the price when the queen (woman) loses. They&#39;re being slaughtered in droves. But who&#39;s fighting on the good side? Both men and women. It is suddenly okay to have a more balanced distribution between the sexes.The Queen herself? She is transformed into a goat towards the end of the film, but gets to keep her life. Had a man in the same villainous role gotten away with life?The answer we have already received, in the first film about Malificent. Back then, her nemesis was a man. He died at the end of the film, having fallen from a tall building.

Aurora was a bitch in the middle of film. Like someone you have just met is insulting your mother and you are like &quot;mother calm down&quot; &quot;look what you&#39;ve done!!&quot;

Love both Maleficent movies

Go Beyond the Gary tale

Ahhh that&#39;s just mother&#39;s love 😘😘😘😍 ...  sweet🙈

Nobody, literally nobody:Le Maleficent:         &quot;Well, Well&quot;!

Wow.....

Malificent Is a good guy At the end

Stephen could&#39;ve been king without cutting off her wings. All he had to do was marry her. Win Win Win for him.

Is 2014 movie better than this?

Surely the Queen and Maleficent get together
Feel like today what you want to be tomorrow.

Could someone lend me the Disney plus password to watch me malevolent 2 please ??

Was I the only one who cried for this movie?!Like come ooonThat was *Fantastic*😍

How to make the soundtrack for a trailer:Hit the drums like you&#39;re having a seizure.Done.

Melefecenta as like demon or fallen angels from biblie hole

Love Maleficent❤️..great movie in another perspective...worth to watch 🔥🔥

I like this film interesting and very touched;)

currently waiting for the third movie

deshae frost

hey iam watching custers last stand staring  ben hur

mxr plays

Almost sounds like Male Defikinc
Raised by Movies n Comforted by the net norp

1 year old already!Didn’t seem necessary to make a follow-up but I actually found this one more enjoyable because it builds more of the world Maleficent inhabits, the mythology is much bigger than we thought better action scenes, too and the costume designs are spectacular the choice Maleficent faces here is sticking to protecting those like her or holding onto her humanity with Aurora it&#39;s all about aggressive action versus pacifism, uniting a kingdom based on politics vs love, and whether or not wiping out the enemy is best for ruling an entire people there&#39;s even a Biblical element towards the end that may feel like a cop-out for most viewers but it comes full circle considering the fairies&#39; rich history if you didn&#39;t get enough from that previous movie then this one does try to step it up a bit more

The trailer is so good but the movie was kinda disappointing

Great trailer. Whoever made this trailer, sure knows how to give goosebumps.

<b>*MAJOR SPOILER. STOP RIGHT HERE IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T WATCHED*</b> I have never been on such an emotional roller coaster. Like when Conall died????? When we all thought Maleficent died???? When they freaking gas chambered the creatures of the Moors?😭 I have never been so emotional✋🏽

I hope this movie gets a 3rd movie.

PHARSA Tank Build

I said no.

Magnificent is so so so beautiful

I love both movies!!😍😍😍💣💥 Cried for both of them! Love Angelina in this she SLAYED in both movies! I love their relationship , her and Aurora 😍😍😍 especially when she call her &quot;beasty&quot;

And I think Elle Fanning was the perfect person to play Aurora.

Also I think Angelina Jolie was totally the perfect person to play Maleficent.

I like watching the real live Maleficent then the cartoon Maleficent.

Im from Viet Nam

MALEFICENT REALLY SAID “no❤️” 😂
But next time we have to meet a lot.. Amen.
Disaster will come. Amen.
All of it rubbish compared to the cartoon Maleficent. She was much better.

The most beautifull... !

Beautifull

Wow what a movie

This is adult or not??

Themaleficient is the most great movie

FutureA third Maleficent film was announced to be in development in September 2021, with Angelina Jolie being attached to the project. The first draft of the script is already written, reportedly by Linda Woolverton and Evan Spiliotopoulos.Disney confirmed that month that the project is in the works, with Jolie expected to reprise her role. In November, during an interview with D23 Inside Disney Podcast about Jolie&#39;s film, Eternals, she hinted her return as Maleficent in a third film.

SUMPAH INI FILM KERENN BANGETTTTT DAHH

Angelina Jolie is the best!!

You spend time caring for humans Now it&#39;s time to care for your own

Don&#39;t ruin my morning. Love doesn&#39;t always end well bestie.

Is she ever get HER TRUE LOVE KISS?

⚠️⚠️Spoiler alert⚠️⚠️Everyone noticed that after being a phoenix, Maleficent's wings changed, some feathers became bigger, the team thought of everything for true transcendence
Well well😏

Thats was so sweety

Angelina Jolie is Magnificent 🤫🥺😭🥰🥰🥰
Malificent is not the evil here, it’s the humans

I just today watched this.... And hated that you guys showed her so evil in trailer.... She didn&#39;t deserve be shown this evil!!!

Disney: Let&#39;s make Maleficent as hot as possible. Malleus Draconia: <b>coughs in Disney</b>

Best movie

It should have been called Queen:mistress of evil or something because the Queen were the evil one while maleficent didn&#39;t actually do anything evil really

This was a good movie Good plot beautiful graphics could not have asked for more this is the lady maleficent Life from the sleeping beauty she should be in Marvel&#39;s she got more powers than them... all this to be king took her wings for nothing still died at the end of the movie Stefan was a lame I must have to see part two to see why she turned evil for good but this was a good movie I was very surprised... She should be on avengers if you ask me...

Aurora being maleficent&#39;s daughter be like: My mom&#39;s hot checkk

The bird is lowkey hotEdit: I mean the bird as a human not a bird bird

Director : how much VFX you wantProducer ; Yes

The best Disney live-action movie. Angelina Jolie is perfect 😍 We need Maleficent 3 🖤🖤

I loved this movie i hope they make another one 💖💖💖

Im do glad i got the movir it is SOOO AMAZING!

Who is from Poland?
I just wanna say the outfits in this movie are wicked

Angelina jolie plays maleficent perfectly in both movies and wen she had her wings back she looked stunning,beautifull and stronger. I love both movies

That&#39;s horror movie

Sad how talented Hollywood actresses in their 30s only get to play the villains in Disney movies bc that&#39;s all the roles Hollywood has to offer for actresses over 30

We fvrt movi👌
&quot;You don&#39;t know me,&quot; said every YA movie ever.

Disney doesnt understand what being a villain means

I am beginning to hate all weak protagonists characters in movies ended up killing the lives of those who were trying to protect them because they wanted to show mercy (fuck you aurora, youre just a pussy) . I wanted aurora to die in this movie... I would kill anyone who would kill my family...

Is it just me or do you love it how they don&#39;t show about the other fairies like her? But then in the next part BOOM get wrecked you do get it

Only Angelina Jolie can say “well well” so evil like. The best cast member for the franchise. She must love being evil!🙂

I always remembered from when I was a kid how scarey she was yet so elegant, great sense of humor. I am so happy we all manifested the movie through our love to be a fairy. Whats the philosophy of sleeping beauty and the meaning behind the spindle wheel?   And Elenor Audely had an excellent voice. Maleficent 2014 was incredible. Just enough elements from the animated movie to do justice! Good job Linda Woolverton.    Love tonight from Chicago=    Paul DiGrazia

I just watch second part or i need to watch first part before second part ??

Nothing to see here ppl, just another angry mother in law

Me dreaming about good stuff Alarm  clock ringsMe: <a href="">0:20</a>

when will it be out of Netflix

Maleficent is one of the greatest Disney characters ever and Angelina is absolutely amazing, perfect casting in two brilliant films.

I just watched it and it&#39;s so good

They had the audacity to change the prince and give him the same name as the first one smh

Amazing wonderful great 😍😍The queen of the queens is MALEFICENT

The only thing i hate in this movie is maleficient&#39;s so called stupid daughter!! she is soo annoying and gets everyone killed...she doesnt even deserve to be a maid forget a queen !! duhh!

It was so obvious that the queen would end up being the antagonist. I wish she would’ve grown to appreciate maleficent and her people, and fight along side them against something else.

I can&#39;t help but think that Disney is trying to send a message

Why did they title it Mistress of Evil when she isn&#39;t the villain? 🤔

Amazing sequel! Amazing! ❤
Maleficent is my favorite Disney Princess movie, though it is focused on a villain. She&#39;s the most kind hearted villain ever. No one could have played a better Maleficent than Angelina Jolie 😭💜

the red headed girl literally ruined the movie. jk the movie was so good but that girl was a horrible character in the movie lol.

I hope you guys make a 3rd movie of maleficent about diaval and maleficent being together as a couple. The fans are really shipping this relationship between maleficent and diaval because diaval is in love with maleficent. I hope you guys really do this after this pandemic because if so I will be buying a ticket to see it Lmfaooooo

Maleficent 3 please 💕

I watched it today on 17 may 2020 . Thanks to Disney hotstar 🎉Disney .. expecting better promotions in India .. though I see it&#39;s improved in recent times. I feel sad to miss alladin , Maleficent 1, 2 on big screen .. graphics are stunning. Love you Godmother  💕💕 💕

This movie deviates too much from Sleeping Beauty. I don’t like it, wasn’t Maleficent killed by the prince at the end of Sleeping Beauty?

<b>dont you just love when a movie is realesed in your birthday</b>

Where is wizard of OZ 😊

Me : look mum , I got full marks Mom: how on Earth could this happen??Me : <a href="">1:44</a> you do not know me 😎<b>Mum shocks daughter rocks</b> (not in the case of maleficent)

I like this movie a lot

Excellent
Mom: get your butt upMe: don’t ruin my morning

It’s not the same Prince ?

When i saw Maleficent with Dark Fey, i saw the man with white-wingsi imagined that Maleficent will fall in love with this white-wings Dark Fey (a man that helped children to learn about how to flying in the air when Malficent in the Dark Fey place).After that, i realized, can Maleficent has her own true love? I mean the real true love of a man.I knew that Aurora is her true love of a child and also find a Prince that really loves her, but come on....... Maleficent should be falling in love again and ended like the Prince &amp; Aurora🤣This is just my imagination:) I am sorry if my english so worst.

I like malificent ourora is not

full movie link pleas

Yo why&#39;d they replace Prince Phillip :&#39;(

This movie is the luckiest movie of the season. It was meant to be released this spring 2020 but pushed back to october 2019 and ended up with a 1/2 billion @ the box office.  This needs a very loud Maleficent Laugh across the globe.

Me: Im in the comment section with a thought of a comment, that after scrolling down has already been commented before, im talking about the one with 3.5k likesAlso me: hopelessly complaining about a comment that has already been taken, just like everyother girl in my dread full life...

cringe couldn&#39;t bem e

The background music’s lit. Angie slayed in Maleficent!

Black is not always evil# Maleficent 🎬🎥♥
I LOVE YOU MALEFICENT

Watching This Movie With My Dad

A snake will always remain a snake just like the way evil always remains evil 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I just watched part one, Angelina Jolie is amazing in everything

Worst movie

Does ANYONE know what bird Maleficent&#39;s wings were designed after??

This film is one of the most amazing films. We want more parts
this is one of the most epic movies ever

I made some jokes /YTP about Maleficent, please visit my channel 😊. Thank you!

Look out everyone! The one good Disney remake of 2019!

Is this a good movie also for a 23 year old male ?

Just watching this movie. And the real evil are HUMANS!

It really turned out to be a fun movie. I recommend everyone to watch it 😚
All the story lines all ridiculously boring. As it is absolutely meaningless. Too much to watch with all its absurdity to the whole new level.

She is so beautiful...  ( Jolie)

JENIFFER LOPEZZZZZ😎😎😎😎
I like you very much, I love your movies
Menim en cox sevdiyim kino

This is one of a  great movie ive ever watched!  You really nailed it angelina!! Youre the best!! 😍😘😘☺️

<a href="">0:37</a> &quot;In the dating game, as soon as we leave, memories slowly fade, and new flirtations arise.&quot;

This movie...... &#39;A shitload of Faeries just died... lets have a fucking wedding party!&#39;....

Stupid dumb bitch princess, i was more mad at her then the evil mistress. Maleficent gets hurted everytime coz of her dumbness.😠

One of the most obnoxious trailers I&#39;ve seen in a long time

Linda Woolverton really improved her dialogue for this film.

Yes I&#39;m Rambo.. The... Vissti....

Zxzzxzzzzzzzzzzzzzyou
Alarm Clock BeepsMe :Don&#39;t ruin my Morning.
The movie started really good and realistic but as expected it ended up being the same old disneyyeishhhh niceshhh fakeishhh bullcrap!!so they were at peace but till when???

am i the only one that thinks aurora is useless? like all she did was scream and jump out of a freakin window. she didn’t save the faries a lot of them were killed cuz she’s infatuated with the prince(who got all the credit in the end, like wtf)idk why i’m so angry. i just am.

No more drud tina

Wait a minute didn&#39;t the mother die in  the first movie ?

How much this movie earned

Am I the only one who didnt like the movie?

What happened to the handsome boy grom the first one that met aurora for 5 minutes? They should&#39;ve kept his fine ass

Disney is certainly producing awful movies these days.

The movie is good, but the princess wastes money while raising money and is in love with men, useless :))))
I watched this movie and the casting of Angelina, Elle and Michelle was perfect. If the box office doesn&#39;t flop, Disney should make part 3. I think if you write a good script, you will be hit again.

I really wish they make a sequel, I love this movie so much.

I love this movie with Angelina ,she&#39;s prefect for this act.

They said there will be part 3 the christening I can&#39;t wait!!!!!!

Satanist spotted.Maleficent looks like satanic God Baphomate.
Wow. This looks absolute dog shit. What happened to the REAL maleficent that turned into a dragon and wanted the princess to rot in a bed? Ugh.

I like the movie version of red wedding

When Maleficent first dies in the climax it was like Thanos snapped his fingers

First you must watch the movie, after that you can watch the trailer//

so the evil stepmother is hotter than sleeping beauty

I recently met my future son in law. I don&#39;t like him much...I turned into maleficent without realizing it... Oh well I am British after all.

This wedding was almost a &quot;RED WEDDING&quot;

WOW!! O_O Can&#39;t wait to see this on big screen!! But before seeing this on big screen I think we first save money so that we can but a ticket for cinema. Check this link <a href=""> and learn how to make money online. :)

I loved every second of this.Even shed a little tear. So beautiful.

I find the actress who played Arora sooooooo bloody annoying. Couldn&#39;t they find someone prettier

it&#39;s great film

What are critics meaning by &quot;Overly artificial visuals and muddled plot&quot; ???

Anyone think that Angelina Jolie could play the role of Hela very well ?

Disappointing cringy AF...the prince,the queen and her psycho bitch ..and Aurora too🤦🏻‍♂️kinda wanting to tear them limb to limb 😌but its just a movie so..🤷🏻‍♂️

Prince united two kingdoms?  wth what he did?  chillin around?

I dont know why but I want a movie about Revana vs Maleficent...

That queen is so annoying

Excellent movie trailor .good
Best movie

Awesome movie...💜💜💜
Such a beautiful movie. I&#39;m so glad things turned out happily in the end. No one could play Maleficent like Angelina Jolie!

superb and wonderful trailer

Maleficent you are so beautiful

We need melificen3 plse can u dir3c 5he melificen3

This movie was utterly shit. Do not suggest watching it unless you are a child.



you do not know me 😈

stupid movie. don&#39;t ever watch this because you will get angry, it feels like watching a long-living Korean soap.

Such an amazing movie! Loved it so much!

I have the book malenificent! It is really good to read!😈👿📍

So beautiful history and the idea behind.... Is fantastic but with a base on the real life.. Like those who believe that those who are different from them are the bad ones or those that should not exist when they are the ones that are full of hate... And that&#39;s how beautiful life has the range of different weird things and diversity.I hope so Walt Disney make more movies like this with this message

One of the most beautiful fantasy movies ever.💚

nice movie

it really bothered me that the queen kept saying things she knew would aggravate maleficent, so she could get mad and she could prove to everyone that she was evil when she never was to begin with

She maybe your mother but she is not your mommy

Just rented this from Amazon along with the original for a double feature tonight.

Anyone on maleficent side ? And wanna destroy human too ?

What creature would forgive humans? not a single fucking one thats who. Bullshit movie

Now



Stupid movie. The princess and the prince are the most useless people in the world. Bring nothing but harmful to people. So fucking stupid.

<b>Watching this was such a memorable cinematic experience, just the story in total it&#39;s such a great movie</b> 😭❤

Its all about sleeping beauty

<b>I just watched the movie, now I fcking hate AURORA ! She&#39;s just annoying</b>

Same shit every year.

Just OSM..💗💗💗

All new hollywood movies are cringe damn old version was scary when i was growing up.

Bad writings bad actors except queen and Angelina jolie only 2 of them know what they are doing rest is bunch of pple who dont have no idea what acting is but its really not my call to make but cmon disney u guys can do better

can we appreciate the fact that this trailer had ZERO SPOILERS LIKE HOLY SHIT THE MOVIE THREW ME OFFFFFFFFF

daaaamn dis looks gud
whole movie in fast forward

Well 1st on was good but second was whole new level i liked it.

The trailer spoils the movie

still beat tho

Perfect movie 👍 nice acting 👌 unbelievable Angelina jolie!!
wait did i just watch the whole movie?

Can u dubbed in telugu

Guys what if it was jenn Aniston playing queen Ingrith....

I watched the first and second Maleficent in one go just hours ago. First movie was awesome. But my god this second one is kinda awful... Angelina Jolie is still amazing tho

Still people watch fairy tails??

Bruh I wouldn&#39;t mind cuffing maleficent she baddd

We absolutely want the third part!!!!!

Couldnt watch it because of the blacks. There where no blacks in our cultural heritage.

Why so many black people in a european style movie. This is cultural appropriation. Kings and queens , princes and princesses and knights and magical people are european not african. Why are we no longer allowed our own story&#39;s.

If am on the scene while this movie is made, i will kill aurora my self, am okay with a movie without extremely stupid character like her

He doesn't care about the evening movie ❤️
great movie

Angelina is workin&#39; those cheekbones,isn&#39;t she? lol.

Judgement Day“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne.  All the nations will be gathered in his presence, and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left. “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.  For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home.  I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’ “Then these righteous ones will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?  Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing?  When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ “And the King will say, ‘I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me!’ “Then the King will turn to those on the left and say, ‘Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons.  For I was hungry, and you didn’t feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me a drink.  I was a stranger, and you didn’t invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn’t give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’ “Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?’ “And he will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.’ “And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.”

Matthew <a href="">25:31</a>‭-‬46 NLT
<a href="">

So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

Galatians <a href="">5:16</a>‭-‬21 NIV

Wow

if pidgeotto was a waifu,...

sheisuhBIRB!!
I wish they would remake Ariel to have dark skin

My gosh...those cheekbones are so sharp that she can shave her Pitts..

Mom: Son!! GET UP FOR SCHOOL!!ME: Dont ...... ruin my morning.
The every word that comes out of maleficent&#39;s mouth was like a spell, so magical and it&#39;s kinda badass. I love her God!

I shouldn&#39;t be on the evil side, but maleficent is lit.

They also did really good at teasing less of the twist in this movie

Dude I cried so much in this movie like no lie

Why is Maleficent’s &quot;look&quot; more brown than black now?

<a href="">Translated</a> Full right before deletion 2019
fuck off feminism

<a href=""> watch full movie maleficent part 1 and subscribe guys Thank you

This is my favorite movie ❤️

Skuze me, no such thing as 100% pure as the driven snow. That&#39;s the duality of our human existence! That&#39;s why we relate to good vs. evil movies. We all see the heartbreak of imperfection of it all cuz we all relate. ❤

Ohhh i love to watch anjelna as nagtive

what is this high cheekbones race .. a super model race or something??

This movie was epic 🧝🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️✌🏻
Does this movie has a kiss scene?

Thats my mother everyone. I can tell by  the black horns.

How did this only make $484 Million?

Malcolm McDowell only played psychopathic and sadistic characters. The guy was really crazy! A Clockwork Orange left memories... ☀ ;)
1 like = god will forgive us 💖❣️💘️🎈 💞 O:) :)
Nice movie

It seems to me that it’s better audible and effective in Russian
I don’t even consider her as a villain because she does the things she does for a reason not because she feels like it.

It isn’t 2010 it’s 2019

She&#39;s my role model, a strong and kind hearted woman.

I&#39;m clearing my history :D

well well!

Wow, the movie is very cute 😚😚😍🤔yeah
Why they replaced Brenton to that shitt* ass dude.

So, Maleficent is like The great leonopteryx (Na&#39;vi name: toruk meaning &quot;last shadow&quot;) of Avatar movie. 😃

i like this trailer music so much .. obsessed

Mostly.. desperate house wives of medieval time line... 😐

Can&#39;t wait to see malifecent2!!!!!!!!

<a href=""> href=""> out Oman National Anthem on Google Play! <a href="">

This movie is satanic. Disney has turned so morally corrupt. If you don&#39;t believe me, just do a search about it. For instance, they use the devil horned hand sign in many of their cartoons. Also tons of sexual explicitness. Jesus Christ is returning soon to judge the Nations but he loves you and wants to offer you eternal life! Please give your life to Him before it&#39;s too late. And stay away from evil movies like this!

that wings super amazing!!

Am I the only one commenting with one hand like if u get it

Yeah let me have of that I love her ⚡ :v

apparently this is what happens when you press the “Royal Marriage” button...

Darshan

i kinda liked the beginning of the first film, but hated the ending. i might hate the beginning to this film and might hate the ending to it as well. im so attached to the classic cartoon animation, even

This movie i&#39;love. Maleficent is beatiful

Is it avabile for my age

Hello i havent whatched the movie yet but i want to is it creepy i mean im 11 lol so ye

THERE&#39;S NOTHING I COULD SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE BESIDES A-MA-ZING !!!!! THE BEST DISNEY MOVIE I&#39;VE EVER SEEN 😍💕
Love doesn&#39;t always end well~Angelina Jolie
i got to watch this for free but it was actually good

LOL as if Disney can make a dark bad ass movie, give me a break!

Michelle Pfeiffer is very beautiful.

I like this one

1 like for sorry to God 3:) (y)

this is how my mother reacts when I wake u late in the morning😅😅

sorry god that I watched this  (y)

Love the 2 word dialogue of Angelina Jolie from part 1 as well as part 2 &quot;well, well&quot;😍

I saw the movie at cinema

Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil is a waste of time and an absolute boring piece of trash.

So good

My responsibility’s: paaay attention tooooo me. I ammmm important. You will regretttt nottt listening tooo meeeMe:” Don’t ruin my morning”

Is it good

Whoever chooses, Allah likes it, no pressure 😦😦😦adtagfiruwlah 💜 💞 💜
Please release in Hindi

This movie was awesome! I can’t wait till it comes out on dvd! I could watch it over and over

Time to clean my search history 8|

Where is ashwariya

Disney: most live movies we own have some good cosplay princess with enhanced technology.Maleficent: hold my lipstick.

I already seen this but i just can’t stop watching this cause Angelina Jolie she is just so Gorgeous and i love her accent and voice

Some people will move on and won&#39;t watch this trailer again but not us!

Saw this movie 🎥 with my girlfriend it was good

Maleficent is super good the movie who already saw it

trash
I find it funny how Aurora is on the side of her fiance&#39;s family rather than Maleficent. Girl, your mother raised you for 21 years! Will she deceive you or mean any harm to you? I can imagine the pain Maleficent must feel when Aurora turns back and looks at her in a disdainful way.

I watched the whole movie in this trailer. Glad I don’t have to pay for it 👏🏽

I except more than this from Angelina but it is still the best

Omg

My boyfriend and I decided to watch it today. And I hair stood on end while watching the movie. It was awesome and gave me mix emotions because the movie is full of twist. I love Angelina Jolie too.great actress

The story was so good and the visual beauty was so pretty. Maleficent&#39;s motherhood toward Aurora was so touching.

This film is awesome! In 3rd part,Maleficent finds parents who have also daughter who wants to take Maleficent place and destroy humans 😂😂😂

I’m about to watch this right now I’m at the movie cinema

Stupid movies

This is the best

Such a suitable role for an evil narcissist. Angelina Jolie takes a story about a princess &amp; of course makes it all about herself. There’s something seriously wrong with her.

<a href="">1:33</a> nice outfit 😉
She is so amazing

Malefizzzz turkeyyyyy 🖤🖤❤️
1 like = 1 billion times sorry to god

Seen the movie in cinema. Was really amazing, amazing 3D efects,  the movie itself was more then expected! Really loved this and would love to see it again!

this movie was amazing!

I love this movie they are the shit.

Just saw it, and all I can say is: AMAZING!!!! I hated so much Michelle Pfeiffer&#39;s character and her crazy little red-haired sidekick (Gerda something, I think?). But Angelina Jolie was at her top. She has such a presence on screen and--- oh, that scene when she wakes up in the cave.... she is just SOOOOO BEAUTIFUL. Now I can&#39;t wait to see her in The Eternals 😍😍😍

Not one male hero.

AHH OMG I AM SO WATCHING THIS

Just watched it, IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE. everything looks so dreamy and majestic, absolutely loved it!

Possibly even better than the first!

Humans are Hilarious... loved that part

Love angelina jolie
I love this movie maleficent 2 angline jolie best actor forever 😍👍xxx

This film is really awesome!!! Disney never disappoints
I didn&#39;t know Maleficant was a good guy, interesting twist.

I just came to see the pronunciation of &quot;Aurrora&quot;
She Phoenix = rebirth

You're a movie evr
She is jealous i think... i wish i can watch it. but i have to wait....I think she is acting like this because her first love betrayed her.

Me: Oh? Maleficent part 2? Let&#39;s watch this trailer!Trailer: Here&#39;s the whole movie, hope you enjoyed!Me: Oki...   I guess I just saved myself $20 then? Could Youtube NOT tell me when a 3rd movie comes out please  lol !

Awesome ❤️🔥
Who ever hasn&#39;t watched it yet needs to see it. It&#39;s the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen. There is literally not one boring scene. Every second is better than the last and you just can&#39;t stop watching

Dont spoil my morning!

Don’t RUIN......my  ah urg  urgggg climax...Abouuut tooo arrrr yessss yesssss 😎✌️🚬
The queen is real evil! You can see when she touched the crossbow at the beginning.

This is such a good moive

how i wish i could watch this movie in cenima because im too busy

I already watched the movie and let me tell you.... Maleficent is one of the best villain ever..

Was anyone seriously expecting this movie?
Angelina Jolie is in a secret satanic cult. She&#39;s another Allison Mack she may seem sweet &amp; innocent but she is not!

I really wanted Maleficent to be together with Borra in this film but then I realized it probably won&#39;t happen :))

Who is impatiently waiting for the movie?
I see all the movie in cinema maleficent is good and auroras mother to but I don&#39;t belive it

I wacth this film

I Watch MALIFECENT 2 already.The movie is Great.I highly recommend you watch.It&#39;s worth your Penny/Cents.Bring your family and <a href="">friends.You</a> will enjoy it.

The film is really fun 😂😂😆😆😍😍 guaranteed you won't regret it. Let's get together friends&quot; my country 😂
Who is thinking about descendants’s maleficient ?

This movie was so good and so much better than the first one

My favorite Disney live-action

Great movie.  Better than the first!

This movie is amazing the trailer doesn’t do its justice just insane ❤️

This movie was ten times better than the first one! Angelina Jolie is PERFECT as Maleficent

I just watched this movie todayIt’s definitely a must watch. Best movie I’ve seen in years 0-0 :)))

U lalla
&quot;Aurora my own&quot;Maleficent : what kind of devil r u bitch?

Disney: On October 18th-Me: On October 18th I will go to school, watch the trailer and smash the school computer.

The horns are natural.

Whose here after bebe rexha can&#39;t stop the girl??

This is a standalone film right? We can just watch it without having to watch earlier movies?

i didnt watch the first one. why isn&#39;t Maleficent dead yet like she is in the original

I seriously doubt that Angelina Jolie would allow her own young kids to see this movie. If she did, they would be scared, and frightened of sleeping alone, so they would want to get in bed with mommy and daddy......oh wait,  &quot;Maleficent&quot; is their real life mom....so they would probably want to sleep at grandma&#39;s house....and years later when they became adults, they would be telling the psychotherapist not only about their mom, but about the evil characters she played in movies that scared them into becoming confused dysfunctional neurotics.

🙄

Mess with maleficent and you&#39;re going to bleat for eternityyyyy

The movie is amazing, so beautiful. Worth to watch

Holy Shit Kendis!  IT IS ON!

Angie😍
Well well🖤🖤
How much you rate this movie ?/10

It is soooooo GOOD , even better than season 1 !!!!

I love this movie, so amazing

This movie is terrible. There is so much satanic garbage in it. It full of MK Ultra too.

Just been to see it- my favourite movie of the year, loved it.

amazing movie

Angelina Jolie&#39;s cheekbones can literally slice my neck and I&#39;d still say thank you.

Great 🎥 would definitely go see it again n again n all over again

Maleficent here is more green and less purpleMaleficent in descendants are more purple than green

I wouldn&#39;t describe her as evil. she&#39;s a tad maleficent, but not evil.

pretty good movie! but i have to say something.....ALADDIN IS BETTER!!!

I LOVE MALEFICENT

Oh holy shit I want to see this!!! I literally JUST watched the first one......This has been one of my favorite Disney characters since I was a kid, and I can not believe Disney made such a beautiful movie!!

10/10 AMAZING i want to watch it again and have the dvd😂

I know it&#39;s monday but <b>DON&#39;T</b>ruinmymorning!

Song in the backgrounds?

Oh, by the way Malificent did not kill the King!

Aurora : LeMmE pRoOf YoU wRoNg MaH dUd Like if you’ve seen the movie maleficent: mistress of evil and think its amazing

Lov this movie. Make me feel like want to keep watching it again and again and again. Awsome movie!!!!

Angelina Jolie is my all time favorite actress ❤🙌

Saw this movie today...very good!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Maleficent

I hope there is a part 3 and it would focus on Maleficent alone, her origin, the tragedy and end with her getting her well deserved happy ending.

I love this film. Even villains deserve a happy ending. I hope there is a third installment, focussing on maleficent alone.I made a review of this film, i hope u could watch it ang let me know what you think.

Who else saw the subtitles “you’ve spent years caring for a shoe”? 😂😂 Hahaha jokes aside this movie is really awesome!! Love Maleficent so much!! ❤️❤️❤️

<a href="">

I&#39;m going to see Malificent with my bf in a few days, can&#39;t wait!! 😊💗

Plot twist the Queen is the threat

I love this 😍 maleficent 2 so good i has watch thisSorry if my speaking english not good im not england peapole

While watching this, as international relations student i keep thinking why philip&#39;s mother is realist person that sceptic about cooperative and always want to war meanwhile philip is liberalis person that still have positive thinking about cooperative and unite 2 kingdoms can make peace

Bit of Fury Road chucked in i see.....

Can’t wait for the maleficent 3 👏👏👏

Maleficent did the great job isn&#39;t it 👌

Yikes! What is this even about??

Omg ima see this movie on Wednesday I’m so excited AAA

Glad Disney still knows how to milk the masses’ teets. Hard pass.

<b>Maleficent</b> : <b>You do not know me</b> <b>!</b>We truly never knew her...till now.

I saw this film and it's really beautiful and at the end it's very moving
Uhh guys i noticed a delete scene u hear<b>You did not know me</b> at the trailerWhen i watch the movie in the cinema..All i heard is justAurora:*this isnt you*Maleficent:*u did not*Aurora:*yes u do .. and i dont know whats next..*

<b>hohoho</b>
<a href="">

Satanic Garbage!!!
Where’s the Oscar?

Queen: She will finally get the love of a REAL mother.Maleficient: Hold my beer

I watched it and...I fell in love with Borra

This needs Dr. Evil. It could be all happily ever after, or happily evil ever after.  Imagine everyone in group therapy.

Is that a different Philip?

I feel like I don&#39;t need to watch the movie after seeing this trailer

I think the Prince&#39;s mother is evil. Why else would she insult her like that?

Top

I just loved this movie SOOO much. Angelina was the best. And the story itself was very moving and heartbreaking. Maleficent is definitely n.1 Mom of the world!!!!

This soooo Games of thrones.... i love it

MALEFICENT 3 PLEASEEE

That &quot;Well Well&quot; line always gives me everything omg

<b>Who else thought that this movie didn’t need a sequel anymore?</b> 🙋🏻‍♀️

To be honest I relate to this movie on a whole new level when Maleficent&#39;s shot by the Queen and Aurora cries. I was a witness of my mother trying to commit suicide, but same as Maleficent - she is alive.

angelina jolie kills children you freaks
In this movie her girl is stolen..... In real life, her Husband (Pitt) was stolen !!!

there is no movie worth more watching in cinema than this , this masterpiece

This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, the plot, the cinematography, the CGI and autors...fucking goosebumps entire movie ....

Its going to be one of my favorite movies now n for the rest of my life.... waiting for the part 3👍😍😍

masterpiece and real love

Maleficent is magnificent

If you think about it, Phillip&#39;s mother is to blame for the entire issue. Maleficent was willing to give the union a chance. But Ingrith thought it was a good idea to antagonize Maleficent and try to take the one person she loves most away from her.

Angelina Jolie born for this role.

Boy&#39;s locker room: <i>&quot;Our kingdoms will be united!&quot;</i>Girl&#39;s locker room: <b>&quot;tHeRE wiLl bE a wEdDiNG!&quot;</b>

The Thanos Snap even invaded this universe!

She will finally get the love of a real mother ??? Yea I would of been hot to 😂😂😂

So no one is going to comment how hot and ripped is Borra.

Best disney movie
Angelina is the definition of a queen

The dog loves a guy. I watched the trailer but I couldn't even watch the movie
<a href="">2:11</a> <i>oh shit</i>

For those who thinks that Maleficent is the bad guy in this movie IT WAS ACTUALLY  QUEEN INGRITH*INGRITH  HIRED THIEFT TO STOLE FAIRIES FROM THE MOORS (it was at the start of the movie) AND SHE KEPT THE CURSED SPINNING WHEEL IN THEIR CASTLE *SHE PLANNED EVERYTHING FROM MAKING MALEFICENT ANGRY AT THE DINNER SCENE(if you guys watched the full clip of the dinner scene, ingrith keeps telling Maleficent jokes that are below the belt *AT THE TRAILER YOU MAYBE THOUGHT THAT MALEFICENT HURT THE KING, IT’S ALSO INGRITH ,SHE STABBED KING JOHN(aurora saw it when she tries to prick her finger again on the spinning wheel)*SHE IS BEING PLASTIC TO AURORA *AND THE QUEEN INVITED THE MOORS ON AURORA’S WEDDING BUT IT’S ACTUALLY A TRAP, when all the moors were inside the church, the guards locked the door so the moors couldn&#39;t get out.(and when ingrith said “start the music”) one of her servants played the piano and every time the servant pressed the piano a chemical powder will come out and when the moors smelled it they will become a flowerI have watched the movie yesterday and it was amazingIf you cannot understand what I am saying SORRY FOR MY WRONG GRAMMAR Go ahead and watched the movie

Just got home from Cinema.  Done watching Maleficent and it is damn superbbbbbbb!

Guess what if Disney make Blackpink KTL for a background music for Maleficent  ...damn

This movie was so good! It deserves more love. Angelia Jolie is the perfect Maleficent and Ella Fanning has perfectly grown into the role of Aurora. Her and Phillip were so cute. It was just so good, if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, please do so!

You speend time carying for a human now is time to carry for your own 😮 i wanna take a wild guess is she pregnant 🥶 end of the clip she is hiding her body omg omg omg prying my wild guess is true that last part got me thinking

This film same like film rafunsel

Maleficent isnt the bad guy i know aurora isnt her child but she basically got her child taken away from her

best in 2019

Where Maleficent turn into a Efficasent. Only on the philippines.

This movie is the best ever!

Relly so so scary

I really love villains. Their story is very wonderful if you try to understand them.♥️

So Michelle pfeiffer spread the wrong story of sleeping beauty

Costume designers: how many costume changes should Maleficent  have throughout the movie?Directors: Yes

Am I the only one who was surprised by her outfit in <a href="">1:32</a>, Maleficent is officially the prettiest and the only villain I’d support

Miyavi 💜
Next year must be showwing the next season😆😆👍👍👍

Even in every fairy tale you have war...I'm sorry. Very beautiful film!
Awesome...

what happened to her cheek bones

Don’t! Ruin my moorning 😂 get it Ok imma leave now.

I&#39;m more of a tv series person but this movie is amazing! It&#39;s so full of imaginative things and every moment is so exciting. Plot is very well thought out. All the characters and casts are perfectly fitted for the role. Like seriously, you&#39;ll see what I mean when you see the movie. Every scene just leaves you amazed by the wonderful sceneries and actions. I am very critical of movies and quickly see the flaws but maleficent 2 is flawless.  You wont regret watching this movie.

Angelina Jolie and her mighty cheek bone

I watched this :DSpoiler Warning!&quot;Connans got shooted and die by iron bullet when Maleficent shock see a Tomb Bloom is disappear&quot;Sorry if i give you the spoiler, bcz the film is so cool!(I watched in cinema)

this was an INCREDIBLE movie.

Loyd kadena brought me here

Angelina Jolie actress is the best ...

Amazing movie 👍👍 better than the first movie and so action packed.  Angelina and Michelle both amazing actresses 😁👍

Boy was the kitchen on fire 🔥 at dinner in the king castle between the queen and Maleficent 😓😓😓

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t like the first movie neither this one..

Angelina Jolie is just marvellous !!! I seen it today !!! Im very anxious!!!

Just saw it. Loved it. I want more.

So yesterday i finally got to watch this movie. While watching it, it gave me the chills and i know it&#39;s not just the AC in the theatre (Lol). It also gave me some kind of emotions deep inside me that i just wanted to scream out... And i did...This one scene, it was so majestic and amazing that i clapped and shout and i didn&#39;t even hesitated or think before i did it, nor did i ever think if i would look stupid if i was the only one clapping but i was so fucking surprised when i made the whole crowd row by row clap and shout too. Yesterday was literally one i can add as another one of my best  days ever!

Imagine if Malelficent vs Devil Jin. Or a guest character in Tekken 7.
WOW! I watched it and it was MAGNIFICENT!

Awesome movie . Love from india. Just incredible story and graphics

Just watch this movie today and ohh god Angelina Jolie was terriblly beautiful 💓💓

I loved it, it was a great movie.

The world government is increasingly immersing children in Satanism - to get used to the future that they are preparing for them.

It's so good, watch it, Le Phi Sung Max is so beautiful
- Well Well...💙💣
I Watched The Movie EarlierAnd some of my Favorite lines were&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t love a person from who they come from you love a person from who they are&quot;

Maleficent vs Scarlett Witch, Disney make it happen

Congratulations, you found comments in Indonesian here.

Who else thinks that Angie is gorgeous ?

Its 0ut the shit your film
E per femmine

I loved it

&quot;Five years ago I thought I lost you forever. There is no curse that could ever tell me away from you. Will you marry me?&quot;&quot;Yes&quot;&quot;Mistress, I have a little bit of news.&quot;&quot;Don&#39;t ruin my morning.&quot;&quot;Philip asked me to marry him.&quot;&quot;No.&quot;&quot;I wasn&#39;t really asking.&quot;&quot;Nor was I, love doesn&#39;t always end well beasty.&quot;&quot;Trust me. Let us prove you wrong.&quot;&quot;You have done an admirable job going against your own nature to raise this child but now she will finally get the love of a real mother. Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.&quot;&quot;There is no union, there will be no wedding!&quot;&quot;What have you done?&quot;&quot;We go home now. Aurora!&quot;&quot;Maleficent is a threat to everyone because you are best to protect you.&quot;&quot;Well well.&quot;&quot;One can never been too careful.&quot;&quot;God Mother! This isn&#39;t you!&quot;&quot;You do not know me.&quot;&quot;Tell me what happened.&quot;&quot;There was another creature.&quot;&quot;You&#39;ve spent years caring for human. Now it&#39;s time to care for your own.&quot;

&quot;Dont....ruin my morning!&quot;Best line ever❤

It is a must watch movie, I watched it and it&#39;s awesome!! Watch it in 4d

Guys, I recently watched this movie , it&#39;s beautiful and great. It has breathtaking visuals and has beautiful scenery and acting, mixed with a tinge of humour. The storyline was great and the movie was just awesome. Absolutely loved this movie. Would recommend this to everyone.

The best Disney movies ever seen

I just watched this movie, and all I can say is that.... I NEED MORE MALEFICENT SERIES!!!!!

Can somebody tell me who&#39;s the real antagonist here? And who&#39;s the protagonist?

Before watching the film: The Queen is EvilAfter watching the film: The Evil is the Queen

Ugly movie

Awesome Movie! Good storyline, and touching.

Watched it on first day, it was AMAZING!

Jolie Angelina is back
Is there Vietnam here? Please tell me about the movie
BROO I WATCHED THIS MOVIE and its soo visually stunning!💜 angeline jolie was iconic. this movie is beautiful.

I want Aurora to Maleficent.. That&#39;s it

Fabulous, fascinating, it takes you right from the start into an emotionally captivating and visually powerful fantastic world! I'm thrilled and carried away, more of this please! (｡♡‿♡｡(✿ ♡‿♡)(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤w(°ｏ°)w
More HD and More Colorful.

Mother this isn’t you!You do note know me !Narinig konanaman si youdonote NAGEXIST PALA SIYA!

So does the other mother have powers? I mean a puney little bow isn&#39;t gonna stop Maleficent lol

Who all is rooting for maleficent? ... Everyone: Yes

The movie is actually really good, better than the first. Definitely worth watching, especially the ending. 👍👍

I think the reason why it has fall short opening because of the trailer... It shows she&#39;s the antagonist here. But after 3days because of heresays. The movie already reached hundred million dollars. The artistic way of promoting a film. Thru mystery

Me and my kids just saw this movie and we loved it totally recommend it 👍🏼

To bad it bombed :)c

Spectacular Movie!!! The Villian surprised me. Beautiful ❣️ I cried. Nature and Trees. She rose from Ash into a Pheonix. I told someone I would do that. I did.

This movie was epic! It so disappointing how its not a huge box office how they predicted it when it even better than the first one

who agrees confirms with like

Maleficent movie is great, put it in the now logo, example on 10/23/2019
Wow this looks terrible

Such a great movie! I went and saw it today, I really recommend it!

This is honestly the best movie ever if you haven&#39;t already seen it definitely recommended

I have watched this before NOOBIE PERSON!

The other queen is so insulting!

Where is the movie now? What is this dizziness?
These are the only good disney live actions.

Now if Jennifer Aniston played the villain queen this movie would be in the history books!!!!!! Would’ve been sooo dope because you could actually see and feel the tension between the two!

I just got back from seeing it. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!!!!!! As a huge fan of Maleficent, and the fantasy genre, it was just as epic as I wanted it to be. It&#39;s now my favorite fantasy movie of all time!!!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the fantasy genre, and Maleficent as well!!!!!!!!! 10/10

Im so glad and happy and grateful that they came with the idea to make a sequel, this movie was so good to watch. Way to good. Go watch it.

I have seen the movie i loved it so much!!❤❤

Maleficent vs Catwoman

I WANNA GO SEE BUT MY MOM SAID NOOOO UGHHHH

This was my second best movie 2019 after John Wick 3👍👍

Queen Anjelina Jolie is the only one suited for this role 💪👍👸❤️

looks visually stunning but is there a story there?

best movie so far I&#39;ve ever watch
Disney lost a lot of money on this one. No one likes Jolie, or Pfeifer any longer. Neither one are twenty-million-per-movie actresses anymore, either. So, whomever budgeted this movie should be fired. If they wanted this movie to be successful, they should have tried other or better actors.

I just saw the movie. It was better than I expected, quite a treat 🎃💥🎃. As great as the first one, I&#39;d say. Beautiful and fierce with a strong story line, what can I say. Angie did a great job. The spinning wheel is on this one too, and plays an important role. And YES it is true, Maleficent can turn into a dragon but you got to push her limits to the point of no return. Something we did not see on the first movie. And if you have seen STARDUST (with Pfeifer as witch Lamia) there is an inside joke they used at the end of the movie on Michelle Pfeiffer...lol (you got to see it to find out....)

Saw the film yesterday. It was brilliant. Looking forward to rewatching the first one. Angelina Jolie is a great actress. Really enjoyed it. Had no doubts going in I’d like it. And after leaving theater I loved it.

I watched Maleficent (1) several times; Maleficent (2) is enough for once;

Too much battle scenes; Some moments remind me Mad Max and Game of thrones; The scenography and costumes are amazing;

Why they replaced the actor for the role of prince Philip?😊

what&#39;s the name of music ? so good

Leave malifiecient alone.......................

I watched this movie today and it was amazingI totally recommend watching it👍

angelina is the best... Forever

Didnt maleficent took off the crown, so she should have her hair out.

The movie action and animation is sooo good and smooth but for the story maleficent1 is somuch better...  This maleficent2 is a little boring the story is so soft and easy to expect what will happend in the end :c. Ill give 7/10

I have watched this movie today  that was so good. But was for kids. The mother of the prince is the real animal.

There is always two sides of the story and we always think the villain in the story book is always evil and stuff but there was always a reason why they turned evil if u look at their perspective and malificent felt like aurora her daughter was taken away from her

Ok good trailer but I&#39;m going for Lal Kaptan. Will see this on lappy.

This movie was AMAZING!

Just watched the movie. Angelina Jolie... magnificent. Absolutely stunning. But the sh*thead Aurora, I wanna slap 👋 that b*tch’s stupid face rly bad

Mst watchReally love it😍😍😍😍

It was a very great movie

Thanks for showing me the movie in less than three minutes.

I don't think it's the mistress who's really good :v
Who&#39;s here after watching the movie?

I&#39;m watching it at the cinema

I might watch this at the cinema its looks good

See the movie, if i&#39;m Aurora, i just want to love Maleficent, love her, love her, love her!!! Prince just be a friend.

Ok but I just watched the movie, and I wanna say smth about the movie so spoilers I guessI didn’t know that maleficent actually have such a beautiful hair, like DAMMMNNNN

My favorite movie is back😍
