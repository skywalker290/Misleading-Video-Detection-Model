This show seriously needs to make a comeback and Simi Garewalji is an amazing host. She let&#39;s her guests finish. She understands their emotions and is very humble unlike other talk show hosts and this interview with Rekhaji is pure gold. Simiji talked about Rekha&#39;s personal life struggles with so much empathy and with utmost respect. Truly beautiful.

Damn her accent 🔥
Simi ji I am waiting this in 2024 exactly 20 years later..you first interviewed Rekhaji in 1984 as shown in this video..Now please do another interview exactly 20 years later when she turns seventy..You both are amazing still and very much relevant and living Legends so really looking forward❤😊

Simi beautiful beautiful lady 💞🙏 THANKS
By God she didn&#39;t change in those 20 yrs!! She looks amazing. She must be in 40s during this interview. Look at her so pretty.

Fantastic Engliah by Rekha ji. Hats off madam !

Rekha isn&#39;t just beautiful, she&#39;s equally wise and strong, true example of feminism. Icon for all.❤

Beautiful interview

Trollope

Rendezvous with simi is far far better than koffee with karan

Good that she is grateful after terrible time she&#39;s had. Now things are better for her

Proof Rekha ji does not age.

Simi ji as interviewer and Rekha jibsuperb!artist really worth gold to watch by common  viewers  like <a href="">us.No</a> match of her talent even today in 2023 there is only any only one Rekha and One Amitabh bachachan .♥️👌🙏👍

Oh my God
Oh good god
Never seen this kind of personality,eloquence and fluency...

Sickly sweet....a lot of answers not accepted and hidden, Rekha.Bless you ❤

How’s simi 57 in this and Rekha 57? what even

Oh my god. What an elegance!!! Simi is great to deal people with different energy levels. The show&#39;s tone is beautifully even and watching any of her interviews is just calming, thought provoking. Even our amma jayalalitha was comfortable with her

These are the kind of interviews which can be referred to as &#39; classy&#39;❤

She is such a poetic lover and this interview is like a therapy❤

Both are looking much more better than their past video!!

<a href="">10:18</a> to <a href="">10:40</a> ...and yet her wishes never got fulfilled ❤️‍🩹

The guys here to learn English Communication.. please like

in a bit of second I was worried about Simiji whe she asked about her marriage with Binod mehra <a href="">22:40</a>

She is a fake in this interview, specially about her childhood and parents relation, can clearly sense she is just jhoot boling

Heart wrenching.

When she was talking about her mother, it made me feel like I&#39;m bit like her who is always drunk and dizzy in love. It just hit me really hard

Watching them feels like meditative

Simi agerwal please teach karan Johar how to interview... You&#39;re the best..

She is no diva or mysterious. Its just her makeup and hair. She has had father figures who have groomed her  since her childhood to be an actress. She just lies and makes up things along as the interview flows. And she tries so hard to sound classy throughout the interview. Thanks to Simiji for unmasking her.

Care and providing is love

She got defensive I. The end

Koi ladki h jab barish Hoti h bachhon wala song h n chak dum dum

Rekha Ma Simi Firewall Maa AAP Both of you are loving me very much.
Wow  its the first time i am watching her and her story about her father reminds me of my life..😢❤ i am from South Africa.

Very nice

I wish we people learn this beautiful &amp; promising point. Rather it should be a learning for us and especially those individuals and families who interfere between two love souls. Actor&#39;s response about his Mother-Father&#39;s relationship expressing frankly that having three wives is common in South India and this is very true about South India, &quot;Who are we to really say anything between couple&quot;. Mature, frank and brightest responses from Actor Rekha. This kind of maturity is not seen in our societies - neither in individuals nor parents and never in youngsters. I did not experience it.I interacted with so many senior citizens but no man/woman have this intelligence, wisdom, honesty and frankness with open minded attitude. A loyal male friend is sweet, wonderful, intelligent and humorous but lacks this maturity. Great interaction, and I&#39;M HEARING IT AGAIN. Ms. Simi Garewal&#39;s grace is unparalleled in Indian cinema and as an Interviewer. <a href="">#gratitude</a> <a href="">#thanks</a>

The way she looks at the world is so fascinating!

Their accent&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

RESPECTED, REKHA  SPEAKS ENGLISH IN A  EXCELLENT WAY THAN OTHERS

REKHA HAS GIVEN ANSWER WITH PATIENCE

This is an insane interview to exist on national tv

Rekha ma’am is so stunning and so progressive love it ✨ (also I love the voice quality and the picture quality of the video , they both sound so refined )

Wanted another Interview with Rekha Ji now

Rekhaji is so iconic!

Wow just wow. Eloquent, graceful, intelligent, independent, selfless, mature, enlighten soul and a role model Love you Rekha From South Africa

Rekha is gracefully LYING THROUGH HER TEETH.  SIMI IS SHOCKED BUT GRACIOUSLY COVERING THAT REKHA HAD THE AUDACITY TO DENY ANY AFFAIR WITH ANY MAN.  EVEN A MARRIAGE

Rekha is always amazing!

She s deadly gorgeous inside out....❤

Very good

This interview is holden: a life lesson and also a class and style lesson ❤️

I extremely admire simiji...so graceful n elegant...she should start again this show.. please please do start from old actors..we want to know about them...helenji.. dharam ji..aaha parekh ji...and many other whose spouse are still alive... good about your show is it&#39;s very polite and definitely not gaudy and loud as others... please simiji please consider royal families as well...

I don’t like Simmi. I love REKHA
All she wanted was to have a loving family 😢

Man rekha has such a sexy voice

Only the skin tone and chiseled jaw line has changed

Compare this with Jaya Bachan and her husband&#39;s interview where they openly say her husband isn&#39;t attentive. Home wreckers everywhere come in wrapped packets of seduction. Even at her old age she behaves like some kind of teenage diva.

wow, it sounds therapeutic , wish they take interviews like this rather than so much fuss and so m uch drama. This interview gives more character to the actor- actress and give us more insight on the life they lived and how they live it now.Really appreciate the time, efforts.

Wowww i just loved this interview ❤❤❤❤ every answer has my heart Faar better than coffee ☕ with karan❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Simi seems to be harping on Rekha&#39;s childhood a little too much. It got uncomfortable after a while

Dammnnn!! I wonder why always who need children end up not having it

Watching this is so good ❤

Poor soul…how she had to lie sooo much to coverup for her childhood deprivations !!!her tough time she faced in early years in Bollywood!!!

I jus feel lik listening to her thts how her communication is..Rekha..

What a lady

I think none of the great man has born who deserves Rekha jis love

Is there Simi ji's interview also?
So???

This interview needs to be done again, now that almost ANOTHER 20 years have passed 🥰🎉

What a grace

She is concealing and justifying her pain

Clarity of thoughts is amazing

This is called Grace people GRACE!!

We need hosts like simi Grewal and her show is awesome ❤😊

Simiji&#39;s chat show is MUCHHHHHHH better than today&#39;s boisterous shows. I felt the conversations in her episodes were meaningful &amp; mature.

She looks like a lier to me…. Speaking about her father and Amithab Bachhan… no offence

❤Rekha ji❤ After listening to this , lot of viewers can relate themselves ❤ God bless you

<a href="">

It is absorbing the way Simi Garewal ji  creates an ambiance for the intimate conversations,as if,  you are a part without their knowledge, secretly listening to them. you love to be in it up to end.

I&#39;m not referring to the show with Simi Garwal.  It was great!  Period!  Rekha&#39;s endlessly photographed and poured-over face was a screen onto which her emotional hungry admirers projected  their dreams of flawless refinement or fantasies of desire or lust.  She possessed a face that the camera embraced and an emotional range  that was both compelling and varied. Her voice was husky and this came in handy for all those emotional roles that she essayed with aplomb.  My favourite Rekha film was Agar Thum Na Hote with Rajesh Khanna.

She is very manipulative...the way she answers and twists the answers of her previous replies..she truly is an actor..she is acting even now in the show..

I love Rekha and she is so so beautiful. I also feel she is a lovely human being who just wanted true love and she didn&#39;t ge that. She would have been an amazing match for Amitharb. Shame theire love story never had a happy ending. I love this woman and more respect to her ❤

Rekha sounds like crazy.

The bi queen Rekha ❤

Rekha jaisi lover is too rare ❤

This is what is called definition of dignity

Rekha 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Amazing women I just love her 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
10000 times better than koffee with karan

I&#39;m just mesmerized by watching her!! I mean how can somebody be so beautiful and bold at the same time. She&#39;s surely like a magic ✨ like honestly i can hear her whole day!! :) Bigggg huggs and love to this beauty❤️❤️

Respect ❤🙏❤️ to both Rekha and Simi Jee for keeping the conversation so poised, elegant and inspiring 👌 Unfortunately nowadays we don&#39;t have these real  interviews anymore , it&#39;s just show and propaganda!

Deja vu
She&#39;s the &quot;IT&quot; girl of 80&#39;s

No translation 😢
I also love someone and she is no longer with me, I still love her and think of her all the time . ..

Most honest interview or should I say therapy session I have come across.. made me emotional listening to her😢

My all time favourite, powerful and graceful voice

Its painful to hear dis bful soul😮

Rekha is so condescending. She had an affair with  Amita . They have both decided to keep it a secret. She is like a Gloating. It was an emotional love that brought her such satisfaction she is content for life. This is such a fake woman .Jaya was upset for a long time her husband was an affair with Rekha.

Wow Rekha English is so good!! No Indian accent

Can u guys believe that when she was a bit chubby and dusky beauty and a newly introduced actor in the movies (probably after her 1st movie) in an award show or in something like a Filmy Party Shashi Kapoor saw her and said that She won&#39;t go so far with such personality and  dusky complexion... Then Mina Kumari ji who spotted her as well told Shashi Kapoor  &quot;ur wrong she has that fire inside her🔥 Mark my words she will rule the industry one say...&quot; Such a visionary Mina Ma&#39;am was then... Every single word she prophecized turned to be True

REKHA BEAUTI IS VERY UNIQUE IN THE WORLD..MOST IMPERESIVE.

<a href="">14:05</a> &quot;I still don&#39;t&quot; i felt that..!

Vibe between them is so off Simi seems nervous in first 2 minsRekha s presence is so commanding

Her English is super sexyy❤‍🔥
Rekha ji love you too ❤
both beautiful women &amp; achievers in their own way! They do so much in their one life, really amazing!

But what i feel is that she was not honest with interview

My heart ached when she said i wanted to be married and have lots of children

Rekha&#39;s height is 5&#39;9

<a href="">4:10</a> idk why simi finds it difficult to believe, a woman could be happy with love without commitment. Back in the days, society was open to such unhinged love &amp; relationships. People didn’t care about weddings. I’m from south, I don’t belong to that era, but I’ve been told, men would just go &amp; bring a girl he loves, home. It was acceptable to have a relationship outside of their marriage. Many south actors from 60s, 70s had these things going, with multiple women/men in their lives and all. Children born in those families had a normal life, because nobody thought it was abnormal or dysfunctional.

I watched all three parts and I&#39;m literally crying as I can feel Rekha ma&#39;am s pain during her evolvement, I can relate that &quot;Aliens&quot; word and Only &quot;Never Giving Up Attitude For Any Kind Of Storms In Life&quot; kind of people and also those who has the more strength to turn the Pain into Power can relate these episodes of Rekha ma&#39;am and I really fell in love with Rekha ma&#39;am, May you live long ma&#39;am❤Love you so much Rekha ma&#39;am❤

Her voice is soooo soothing and pure😭❤️‍🔥🤌🏾
When she gets anywhere command power of being a true real woman who knows how to deal with problems because she had dealt a lot in her young age

They don&#39;t shoot interviews like this these days, don&#39;t they.. Now it&#39;s all about masala.

Look how she is interviewing and look at karan!!!

My heart goes out to Rekha. But what is more is that she survived and thrived.

This is the type of interview... now-a-days Karan johor asked about sex to the actress and they also related their own ways too.

How beautiful she is, there is some kind of mystery in her eyes.
Rekhaji is iconic 🎉

She called Savtri “Savitri amma” and that’s literally the cutest thing ever 😭😭😭😭

Can we even compare koffee with Karan and this splendid show

Next year will be another 20 years since this particular interview aired.

Amazing Interview <a href="">#5423</a>
<a href="">22:40</a>  <a href="">22:58</a>  <a href="">24:10</a>

She seemed like covering all the pain she went through

She’s too beautiful for words

I am totally like this... however i can&#39;t gracefully portray what i am

Rekha spoke about faroq Abdullah..is cm of Kashmir used to date her

Her eyes speak volumes
Rekha is lying straight up!!

2023😂😂

What a beauty Rekhaji

I love Rekha even more today.  Respect to her.

Karan johar sikho kuchh this is what we called interview ❤

Aishwarya speaks the same way

<a href="">

Rekha is graceful and so beautiful wowShe looks the same in 2023 wowShe oozez seductiveness she talks so beautiful she is literly a diva❤

Rekha voice my God ❤
Rekha&#39;s interviews are therapy❤

How she remembers every emotion of her’s in every situation in her life in her past is just amazing!

The OG!!!! KWK can suck it.

Deepika rekha g hema g shri devi g sound indian beauty

GG was a womaniser....only tat worst father

Lady with sari with classy look and talking in English ...what a combo Rekha ji

Thinking of her father what a waste he is. Just find a beautiful girl make her fall in love, make love then make babies and just move on. It was the same case with Savithri and her kids. Gave them a very bad and traumatic childhood I can imagine. Bad example of a father, man and human.

I see myself as Rekha after 20years:)

Madam Rekha speaks good English.
Just compare this with KWK....... elegance and grace being replaced by gossip.....

Rekha is a woman who never received the love of a father neither the love of her life ✨

All of this but to be in a relationship with a married man is not cool. Yes the man is also to be blamed but a woman should never be weak and selfish enough to sleep with someone else’s husband. This is shameful. Fun is when the man marries the side chick and then cheats on his now wife so pls stop promoting this

What beautiful interview i just love it🥰😘

Rekha lied in interview a lot.. it’s really hard believe any of her answers. 20 years from this interview she will say something else.

Many things to learn from this amazing human being... Wow she said she is healed and happy for what she have. No crying over past. That&#39;s amazing.

rekha is ICONIC, so graceful and beautiful wow ❤

The way she said about her childhood dreams that she wanted to get married ,have, children and get a loving husband  brought tears in my eyes

<a href="">3:37</a> - I don&#39;t remember that (that her father left as she was a baby)<a href="">6:07</a> - I do remember him as a baby<a href="">#confused</a>

<a href="">14:00</a>

I really never knew this rekha... Thank you fir this interview... Love and lots and lots of respect for rekha mam ♥

When she said they all were married, we have 3 mother&#39;s 💕💕

She is an icon❤ A beauty

Imagine making a talk show work with absolutely no interest in their sex life. It&#39;s surprising.

deja Vu... wow....

aishwarya roy talking like rekha
Good gracious she&#39;s breathing taking beautiful 💓

Whats with the fake accent bancho

She&#39;s just so stunning 🥹

Rekha&#39;s bold makeup is the highlight of her classiness

There is something about Rekha , so mysterious and attracting. She carries a lot of pain but hides it in a beautiful manner. she  no longer wants the rest of the world to get access of that pain  because they would want to sympathize with her . She wants to keep it closer to her so she gains strength and gratification.

I have never come across anybody who hasn&#39;t praised Rekha&#39;s charming personality.

Rewatching this interview years later, I have new found love admiration of Ms. Rekha. I am able to see no much more depth in whatever she says. I am stunned at the comments people too - people are really revolved. So much to learn from this interview and the comments on this interview. You all are amazing !

I&#39;m shocked to know she&#39;s Gemini&#39;s daughter

Wow, we need to get biography of Miss Rekha ji <a href="">#biopic</a> movie

She&#39;s so graceful, an icon for real.I could never imagine the pain she went through, i can see she&#39;s so sad yet she carries herself so beautifully. I&#39;ve never seen her or anything but after this interview I&#39;d love watch her movies, this was ethereal. She&#39;s so strong love her

Simi could have been a world-class psychotherapist! She ticks all the boxes!

This looks more like a therapy session than anything else 😂😂😂

I’m here after instagram reel
My god her dream was to be loved by someone and have children.... unfortunately she is single with no child 😟

So politely she lied about her family background

That jawline and those cheekbones.....

I&#39;m crying at the same time I&#39;m regretting why I came across this interview. I&#39;m emotional person and I can&#39;t forget . Sometimes you feel destiny is against you

She carries herself like a QUEEN!!!!!❤❤

Has anyone questioned her regarding dressing as a bride when she’s not married? Like with sindhoor? Can anyone answer this?

&quot;Anything that&#39;s filled with Romance is not easy but having said that I think Romance is beautiful.. no matter how difficult it seems...I think Romance is wonderful...it&#39;s worth it!&quot; Such beautiful lines🥺♥️

The clips of this interview is like going viral on Instagram. .so being rekha and Amitabhs fan .. so i am here to watch full interview

Scornful Jaya is nothing in front of you my Lovely queen💝💘🌹💕

Elegance, Beauty, Intelligence, Class, Hardwork, Struggle, Endurance, Well behaved, composed, so honest and much more... She is Goddess,  ...There is no male counterpart to match her😍😍💖💖💕💝🌹💐

If God is called as Man then he&#39;s my soul man ...omg this line hit truly ✨👏

I remember watching this show on TV more than a decade ago, on star world I believe. A more recent one than these episodes maybe, episodes of Deepika, Anushka, Ranveer and so on. It was the time I had lost someone important. This was a very warm and comforting show. Unlike the cringe worthy and provoking ones. This one was so natural and flowing. Good old days.♥️

Iam sorry to say but some women shouldn&#39;t become a mother, it&#39;s not a role for everyone. And her mother is one of them!!

Honestly, her life could be a movie.  Trauma caused by her lack of a father figure.  Being forced into the ugly world of filmdom at that age.  Being used and abused by men all during her life.  Her husbands suicide with her dupatta.  Maintaining her dignity and identity through all of this.   Hiding the pain from the world, because she knows that nobody would be able to understand her.

Oh god this woman&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Why the uncomfortable questions ?

Rekhaisbeststar

Look at the grace of these women. So soothing to the senses. It is sad listening to the interviews of actresses of today&#39;s generation. Education, grace and modesty needs to come back. Literally want to throw up when kareena kappor, anannya pandey, malaika etc speak 🤢🤮

her energy is unbeatable. such an elegant women.i love her sm

Why is she denying the marriage with Vinod Mehra? 22.40

Simi was an aggressive interviewer, she dug into guests personal lives like nobody’s business

Her words clearly express she has nothing more to loose🙂

Rekha 🥹her journey is very beautiful! So beautiful how eloquent she talks about healing

Rekha is very cool.. But simi&#39;s English is also Epic

Rekha is the most relatable and realistic

Simmi ji rekha ji two great actress  my favourite  actress  I like you
Who is here after watching insta edits of this show like me.

Both ladies are beautiful❤

<a href="">14:11</a> &quot;I still dont&quot; has something very deep to say

She did kne movie Sansar dat was a bit of her story

Sushmita Sen at present possess the same vibe as she usher around her through her elegance!!

Who all r coming after bb pliz like

Yr she said, &quot; deja vu &quot;

Everything she speaks is so poetic, i can listen to her for hoursssss

Rekha ❤😭
Oh my God both of their voices are so comforting!! It&#39;s more like you are listening some peaceful words❤️❤️and rekha i am insanely in love with her husky voice❤️😳

I came to sneak a peek at her shows after watching her in Bigg Boss 😍❤️She is gorgeous and so graceful 💟🙌🏻

I think you should come up with Rekha ji in 2024 which means against 20 years later from 2004..

Fantastic
Princess D Vibes✨
watching for the 3rd time..

Wow Rekha is cute

What year did this air?

Coco Chanel vibes
The best decision I made today was to watch this interview!

Rekha ji is beautiful outside and inside... Her English at that time is much more better than today&#39;s stars... She speaks english normally no showoff...Dressing is soo cultural it&#39;s most attractive side of her...

I worship Rekha! 🛐
When you wanna both be her but also be beside her, dear God. MUMMY. What a Goddess.

Women like her are so Rare … im not Indian but I watch her movies.. majority Indian women are very talkative.. she hve such pose, elegance it’s magnetic she pulls you in extremely sexy

This interview is strange. Very passive aggressive and lots of shades. The eye rolls. 😆

Rekha, She is so much ahead of her time. Truly one of the timeless beauty and a persona

this show seems way ahead of its time

Me at a point hating all men in her life, gosh she&#39;s so special 😭

Rekha&#39;s level of maturity is too sacred for the world to comprehend

Oh my god. Rekha has been through a whole lot of shit. A traumatising, unaffectionate childhood. Never received either of her parents love and attention, her father literally refused to acknowledge her. Mother who made her dropout of school at such a young age, crushing her dreams and desires. Never cared to listen what she wanted in life, sent her away from home. She was in a totally different city having language barrier, no one to look up to. In a shithole place like Bollywood. She definitely ran away from the sets not because she wanted to have ice cream or have a break she used to run away because she hated there, she hated her job. Of course she was suicidal because this was way too much for a 13 year old to take. It’s even hurts to imagine what she has gone through.

I love how honest she is. ♥️

I think this questions are over the limit and intrusive. Rekha still is being polite and respectful even though the questions should actually be asked about films and not her personal life

Sushmita and Rekha speak  well and amazing 🥰😍😘

Gemini Ganesan  is a Bustward.... He tried to fu.... hiz own

Jhuti ka interview

Beauties ❤️
Her voice 🔥 Queen!!!
CHHOR DENE KE SABB BAHESNE LAGTA HAIN...✌✌CHAAR LAAT MAARUNGAA MARR JAAYEGAA
Rakha amitab would have been such a cute couple

Really wish we have interview like this in today&#39;s time. The poise, the Grace and the articulation is immaculate.

When this show was telecasted

Strangely, no male person was nd is there with her....like nobody could be by destiny.

Was this the interview where she almost confessed to being attracted to women 🤔 although given the openess today she might&#39;ve told the press

I think she&#39;s very inconsistent and tries to pass herself off as someone she&#39;s not really at her core. It looks like she hasn&#39;t really dealt with her feelings and traumas. I feel bad for her for that.

Rekha ji has her own journey of life, ofcourse this is hard truth that parents gave their children tough life, but Rekha ji has proved that her parents life has no bad impression on her professional life, she becomes strong and set example for many women to be strong in every situation of life, she is goddess

Love you Rekha Ji. You are so sweet and beautiful.😍😍😍

BOUNDARIES!!!!!!???????

Rekha Ji is a gay icon

The way she praises her father and mothers, let me tell you Savitri had a depression due to rthe flirtatious and wayward life of her husband ie, rekha&#39;s father, Rekha&#39;s mother started working in young age as she has to feed her family,  her father never acknowledged her or her sisters. her mother Pushpavalli was still married to her first husbaand even while she was living in with Rekha&#39;s father. all these women had terrible life and life was not very sweet for Rekha either

I just love how Rekha Ji answers every questions so beautifully. She&#39;s honestly such a charming lady. And this interview is exactly the way it should be. Simi Garewal Ji feels more like a therapist. Can&#39;t stop adoring 🥺❤

Once i become famous actress in film industry i want to have rendezvous with my my favourite Simi Mam🥺🥺...

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find my next relationship in this comment section. Such beautifully empathetic people.

Rekha ❤
Grace grace and grace.  While the world is grumbling for what they didn&#39;t get, it&#39;s great to thank for what we got. Huge learning Rekha Ji.

Watching in 16th Nov 2022✨
I needed to hear this. When she said she healed….gives me hope. That healing is possible. Trauma does heal. There is a light at the end of this tunnel.

Her dream was to settle with loving husband and have children. But look at her no man no children this how life changes you with time.. Rekha ji is just amazing ❤️

Looking at this interview made me realise what truly being grateful means. She never once told about her tough stories in a way that would reflect that she is seeking attention or sympathy. She told her story as a movie story. Completely fascinated and so humbled by the life’s ups and downs but coming out as a graceful person. Hats of to carry such attitude after a hard life. Loads of love Rekha the legend.

Anyone here in 2022 ?

I like how Rekha interview is not at all perfect it&#39;s just like us like one time you are so happy with all the attention but at the second time we know what are the prices we are paying so we are sad also at the same time so she just let it out all of it it&#39;s not like she thought she might look like a double one here telling something the one time and another thing and the same time but that is what actually humans are we all feel to think that time

for someone who claims to have no use for words to express herself she gushed an awfully lot about bachan &amp; imo quite inappropriately considering he was a married man residing in the same city &amp; working in the same industry.makes me think they were for sure in a relationship &amp; this was a way for her to covertly talk about (the big/biggest love in her life) without pissing him off.Yes she seems very wise but being hopelessly in love with a married man? Nothing wise about that.

She never got what she wanted!! That hit hard

Def caught Simi in disbelief at some of Rekha&#39;s blatant lying.

She has so much childhood trauma. The fact that she defends everyone is a huge sign of trauma. I hope she has healed.

Anybody will fall in love with who she is💕 I don&#39;t understand how can amitabh leave her

I love Rekha so much she’s a queen
Longing
Wow, Rekha was still beautiful! Rekha ka till or bindi bhi sone ka hona chahiey thaa.

Rekha&#39;s mother tongue was Telugu. She learned english in school which she attended till just class 9th. And then she learned both Hindi, Urdu and Tamil which is a lot !!! She became so fluent in Hindi by herself that she dubbed many South Indian actresses including Sridevi.

Actually it was legal for Hindu men to have multiple wives until 1956 &#39; only if the women are unmarried &#39;. That&#39;s why Gemini&#39;s marriage with both Alamelu (his maternal uncle&#39;s daughter), Pushapavallli and Savithri Garu were all possible. But as divorce was not available for Hindus until 1956 and Pushapavallli&#39;s first husband Rangachari (with whom she had Rama &amp; Babji) just left her without divorce, so she couldn&#39;t assert her legal rights as wife of her second husband, Gemini.With Gemini, she had her third &amp; fourth kids, Bhanurekha &amp; Radha. And after Gemini, she fell in love with a way better man named K• Rakesh, a renowned cinematographer and became his legal wife. Pushapavallli had her fifth and sixth kids, Dhanalakshmi and Seshu with him.

Aish well spoke like her because of that batchin family hate her because success women will always be hated

After listening this lovely talk, I feel that, Rekha&#39;s life is a pure running river, and  today I got a drop out of it to make my life beautiful. Although, I felt like, at times, she talked very cleverly, but Simmi being a great interviewer, made her to answer openly.

No ones dreams come true. Everyone imagine... but few people can luckily fulfilled their dreams. It&#39;s life move on forget yesterday welcome tomorrow 👍👏

Relatable childhood.. I get what she has been through and why she is what she&#39;s (both good and bad aspects of her life). It&#39;s like looking into a mirror, emotionally.

Any day Rendezvous over Koffee. Please come back Simi. 💕

She lives married in her own loving 🌎of feelings, that sindoor looks so beautiful on her she radiates beauty.

She is so gorgeous

belated happy birthday Rekha ji you will remain queen of hearts. love to you

she didn’t speak straight about anything even in such an intense interview with 3 parts!

❤️❤️ I love you my Dharma wife Shri Mati Bhagya Rekha SV Prasannaru ❤️❤️
<a href="">3:10</a>

🔥 KP Chand 🔥 Happy Film Life Story 👍 Yes 👍
Omg. I just came to know about this channel..👍👍👍😘😘😘😘My love rekha...😍😘😘😘😘😘I have the same love story..Even name is same..

Aishwarya Rai looks like Rekha&#39;s daughter
Her English is so updated and the accent is amazing for that era. And she is gorgeous and elegant 😭🫶🏻❤️

I understand her when she says not knowing what a father is doesn&#39;t make that empty space in your life. I never realised my father never lived with me.

Gorgeous rekha attractive eye
Savitri amma ❤️
Rekha ji is epitome of  a woman who wants a man but doesn&#39;t need <a href="">him.My</a> role model

Simi Garewal: Did you fall in love with that man?Karan Johar: So now that you&#39;re dating Mr/ Mrs XYZ 😂🤣😂🤣

Like this if you think we need a Netflix special with Simi ji having fresh new rendezvous &lt;3

They speak so soft and calm my ears are blessed

At that time, when we spoke English, there was not much arrogance in it, we used to talk in a very respectful manner, today we speak English in a modern way, there is arrogance in it, such words are also used, arrogance is visible in one's body. Language
Who is she? I&#39;m confused 😂 is she married to bachan.?

What year was this from?

I am  huge fan of Rekha&#39;s voice, her sense of dressing and way of carrying  herself....such a Diva❤️

Simi gives more like a therapy 💗

Simi G, has the talent of interviewing folks with precision.  Great job

2022.8.6❤️
I&#39;m scared now as my life is going to be like this. My desires are also same. Have family but can&#39;t happen

the amount of misogyny Rekha ji had to stand against is hard to imagine! she is such a gorgeous and intelligent AND a strong woman! I wish she had more confidence in herself and her attributes! but alas...

I binge watched all of your episodes on YouTube and I have to compliment you on how good they were! I was born in 2004, so in no way was I able to watch them &#39;live&#39; but through YouTube I am vicariously able to live in that era. love you simiji ! not only are you an amazing journalist but you are also absolutely gorgeous! please come back with &#39;rendezvous&#39;! would love to watch it together with my family!

She talks so gracefully so as simmi mam luv her intetviews aajkl bollywood mei aise shows dikhte nh bs bkwas kra lo sb se phunche k lye khycb hota nh you really need to come back mam😊😍

Rekha demonstrated poise and great sportsmanship given the rapid-fire and somewhat pretentious line of questioning thrown at her,in particular re: her estranged father. Had the roles been reversed I believe Rekha would have given a superior interview as one can see that she&#39;s a good listener.Beautiful set for the interview. Love the water element and reflection in one shot. Minute <a href="">8:30</a>

She didnt want to admit her real feelings or tell the truth about her childhood

The only and only problem with rekha is that she just fakes everything a lot.

Look at the grace Simmi ji have!!

rekha is so attractive much more then todays miss india or miss world

Purely Authentic Purely Bold and Open thats what I love about Rekha ji

Rekha Reminds me of priyanka chopra..independent  selfmade

At <a href="">21:57</a>, she speaks: they&#39;re just scarred. After that she speaks something like: you just! That sentence is not properly audible. Can anyone help please?

Didn&#39;t like Rekha&#39;s responses at all. Very guarded, at times fake, and then she almost snaps at the question of her marrying the man. Why appear for an interview when you&#39;re not prepared to answer honestly? Simi does ask tough questions, and everyone must know before appearing on the show.

nice blog <a href="">
Y r u so harsh with her simi ?

Rekha g collapse all the liberalism and so called feminism in just part one of the interview 🤣🙏❤️❣️ but at the end legend for a reason

The legend

Her fluency in English wow.... beautiful voice.....👌

Wow

Rekhas such a beautiful human being inside and out..with so much hurt and pain she went through not only in her love life but even as a kid....shes so positive about everything and everyone...not everyone has the courage to hold themselves together after going through so much in life.

I think either she&#39;s still delusional or doesn&#39;t want to air her opinions in the public. Like the way she talked about her father and when simi brought up the topic of her suicidal tendencies.And when she says she doesn&#39;t feel bitter because she has healed. Healing doesn&#39;t mean forgetting how you felt or what happened to you instead it means you accept what happened and move on with a better understanding.

Wow

Amazing
Isnt she something else? She is such a strong woman yet so relatable.

<a href=""> and Big B story in Kannada

Two of the most beautiful women sitting together

She was 55 in the interview. She looks absolutely fabulous. Bollywood ddnt make use of such beautiful and talented actress.Kate Blanchett can be super villain in Marvel movie at 49. Why can&#39;t she be casted in good films?

<a href="">

I wish every woman gets loving husband children bcoz they feel very happy n complete in life..women are very emotional

Just because she didn&#39;t get Amitab,the whole bollywood portraid her as a &quot;tragic figure&quot;.and that&#39;s bad.

Her voice is so relaxing 🥰❤
This interview is so theraupathic !

Wowwww this talk show is really amazing! I got to know this talk show when I search Ratan Tata interview and I thought the host is not an Indian cuz of her more like British accent and so I Google it n came to know she is an Indian actress and now I can&#39;t stop watching all the interviews! I&#39;m loving it!!

<a href="">

The supremacy of rekha&#39;s voice ❤🔥😩

Nice and lovely

Simi Garewal is hands down the best ever  host in indian talk show history

What a painful interview.

Excellent Rekha!! Love her versatility as an actor.

Listening carefully we understand how struggling childhood days she had... She hid her real sentiments and feelings deep down in her heart... She was an overburdened child... No  real happiness no joy, only from set to set shooting, making money for her family

<a href="">

She&#39;s so beautiful 😍
I love to fly  to my problem is that

She is beautiful

Simmi ji is great...she must start again..she can make anyone speak life..such a lifestate respect..good.but sometimes lit tough for anyone.

Rekha g !You are the combination of inner and outer beauty. You are poetry, you are rythem, you are the face of sensitivity.You are blessed with a Golden 💛 heart.May you live long 🙏 ❤. Simi g after watching one episode of rendezvous I become addicted. Grace, elegance, in white attire you look like a fairy.

She’s so beautiful can’t believe Indians thought of her as ugly in her early years

Her relationships failed because she never had a relationship with her father. Healthy relationship always begins with parents first

How should be a host?? It is an ideal hosting.

Gosh we have normalized abuse of young girls by Bollywood. We gotta stop looking up to them as role models

Rekha ji is a woman of substance

She still looks better than all the Bollywood actresses

Rekkaji
Both are so articulate in carrying out this free-flowing conversation.

The way Rekhaji talks ❤️
When Bhanu looked behind me or looked at everyone….
Anything filled with romance is not easy, wow!.... You can clearly see she&#39;s reciting what she learned from her mother but also her personal experiences.

So much she sufferred  atleast rest of her life let her be at peace

Looks like aishwarya
I am south indian iyerA fan of Gemini ganesanThe way Rekha gives her reply so much impressedEven though so many people hurted her she never <a href="">minded.so</a> greatDaily I  am watching thisvshiwI am great fan of RekhaA great <a href="">lady.no</a> one can be compared with her

🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰pakistan
Love.Keep.so.nice
Her words and the way she speaks is so impactful and strong. What a personality.

Hello madam dont try to push the whole blame of your father actions and deeds on  WHOLE SOUTH INDIA okay South mein aesa bikul bhi nhi chalta hai thik hai aur yeh cheeze kahi bhi nhi chalti hai me in my wildest dreams cant think or accept the fact that having multiple relationships is okay in South India or any part of the country it just portray the wrong image of south india here yeh sirf apke ghar hua hai ya apke ghar mein chalta hoga pure south ko yaha wrong portray mat kro dont try to blame or Shame whole south india just to cover up ur fathers wrong deeds and i feel like you are  following ur father&#39;s legacy but in a indirect way like he was married but was still into various kinds of women even till his last breath and you are single and still into married men  and specially you being a south indian first saying this is more astonishing for me!!!

She is amazing in giving all the good gurl wale ans

Daddy issues

She is absolutely gorgeous on and off screen 😍

Simi is just taking digs at her this is so crappy

My all time favorite actress.Rekha ♥️

The epitome of Class, Elegance, Beauty..that&#39;s Rekha..Absolutely Gorgeous🧡

In 1974 a friend from India gave me an autograph - it was from Rekha - I still love her ♥ Grees from Germany .

The most incredible woman on planet earth 👸

Watched Mannahati - Savitri (rekha&#39;s step mom&#39;s story) movie this week &amp; coincidentally watching episode of rendezvous. Truly amazed.

I also watched one of her work in 🇩🇪. She with Hrithik Roshan And Preity Zinta it was an alien movie.

Rekha sahi looks
Imagine being so hurt that you dont feel pain anymore But that pains got her experience and knowledge which  makes her strong , fierce and legendary 💘💜

Rekha doesnt give voice to her own real feelings

Rekha s Been  psychologically abused  not recieving ANY comfort or LOVE……She grew upp without a father…. abondoned and ignored by a selfish ,,,,selfcentered,,,,,,immature man 🥲🥲🥲🥲he dameged Rekhas entire future🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲

Love the way Simi brings out of best in people, though they&#39;re already lovely 🤍🤍🤍 but the calmness Simi oozes! ✨

The grace of 80s and 90s ladies just cannot be matched, so ethereal ❤️

Now rekha is much more popular and successful actress then her step mother Savitri....

My mom is a copy of Rekha... Im so lucky to have her

Now almost another 20 years since this golden interview!

They learn foreign accent

For the first time I didn’t like Simmy’s reactions towards Rekha at times ! I mean we could see it

Simiji please come back with your show!!!!!!!!!! It&#39;s desperately needed 😭 especially in this modern day &quot;woke&quot; generation. You&#39;re a force to be reckoned with. LOVE YOU 🙏🏽🌻❤

@SimiGarewalOfficial you really need to work on your accent. It&#39;s too made up.

Gemini ganesan such a womaniser

Why everyone turns their tone to seductive one here. Can&#39;t they talk normal?

home wrecker Rekha She dated married man such a Shame 😡😡😡
Rekha lied about Vinod Mehra and Simmi was so shocked and exasperated.

People are saying that she is hiding her pain. Don&#39;t know why?. May b she wanted to live her life this way only. I don&#39;t know why society put so much pressure on someone to lead life in a predetermined way. Also people makes them feel pity. It may be that they are living life on their own terms and out of their own choice. Not everyone wants the same path. May b that they have found their own path and are comfortable. So please stop making some feel like losers

Omg .today I really fall in lov with Rekha

I feel so bad that she had the worst man in her life , she deserved so much better

Whenever I feel low, I come here. There is so much I relate with rekha ji. An abusive alcoholic dad. Docile mother. Emotional neglect. An unrequited love. Her aloofness. It&#39;s like advice from someone who has trodden the path same as mine. And simiji is a secret therapist I guess. Cathartic interview overall.

Awestruck by Rekha Jis Jawline
When your healed your past does not phase you. That’s why she speaks about it like no big deal and that’s why it doesn’t pitch her soul. I’m proud of her she’s one strong woman!

It is not always white 🌈
Culture Guards 🌈Alva - Why not? You don't have money 🌈Money 🌈Don't eat 🌈You don't deserve 🌈Ok Kill him - Buy Alva 🌈 In Queue 🌈thanks ❤️
God bless you my dear ❤
Zeenat Amans english is super superior articulate and vocuabulary is so advanced. Simi is alsi superb enounciation prouncuation etc. Priyanka  Chopra is also superb. All the others mediocre except Kangana Ranuat is well bred superb english language diction etc. Worse us kareena kapoor and her sister gowri khan shows lack of education etc.

The way she is talking 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I came here after watching mahanti.....to know her relationship with savitri amma(as rekha addresses her)

Sweet.

Is that mole on upper lip is fake?

Your voice is full of hidden pain.....  Being matured is always a last option we are left with ....enough is not always enough for the world.... I love you being innocent forever.....

Always cute.

<a href="">23:05</a> ohh that awkwardness..god why am i here 😌

Is this a therapy session lol

I thought I ll watch it for just 2 mins but omg I ve ended up watching it all and searching for next part ❣️ what a charismatic personality

Respect for you Rekha ma’am. ❤️
Her exceptional journalism was suggested to me through yt algorithms, and honestly as a Moroccan from North Africa, I&#39;m struck by her level of professionalism and otherworldly elegance!

It&#39;s a show of a different plane..but her painful childhood pains us too.God Bless Rekha ji n the most loving anchor/interviewer Simi ji.

I&#39;M IN LOVE WITH THIS EPISODE !!!!!!

That poise, that grace, that elegance REKHA - the epitome of graciousness

🌺 Such a peaceful interview 🌺
May you always remain happy.🙏🌷🌹🙂🌹
Nameskar Rekha mam ji.❤️🌟🌷🌷🌹🌟🌷🌹🙏 Nameskar Shemi Graval mam ji. Beautiful intelligent women, I salute the feminine power.🙏🙏🌟🌷🌹❤️Beautiful Heroines of India.🌷🌹
A true saying that (we are living someone&#39;s dream) hum name and fame k piche bhagte hai aur jinko mila hai unse pucho wo ye pakar kitne akele hai. Really heartbreaking story she&#39;s been through a lot. working since childhood couldn&#39;t even complete her education. Forced to do a job in which she was never interested due to financial trouble. And now she has name &amp; fame but still alone. Pain can be seen in her eyes. lonely ness in her voice. We are blessed to have family, education, friends a normal life and still we complaint most of the time. May god fulfill all her dreams 🙏

So many uncomfortable questions, so gracefully asked and answered. Such were the interviews in those days. Wohoo 👌

Great English fluency…
Rekha is a mystical goddess, she says things, but she is also hiding a lot, she lives in a fantasy world.. she pretty much thinks of Amitabh  Bachchan the same way, she says her mom thought of Gemini Ganesan! Parents do influence their children in many ways &amp; children unknowingly follow in their parents footsteps!

Both women are so fake and acting here instead of being natural

You just can&#39;t take your eyes off of her, oh my god, she&#39;s so majestic.

I just like rekha she is soo beautiful and smart and she humble as well ❤not like jaya bachan😒

Rekha oh God that elegance!!! No present bollywood actress can match that

I don&#39;t think if she was honest with her replies... I might be wrong.

Both of them are so sophisticated

The intro cringe

Soo anyone here after watching Mahanati movie ❤️

Her accent but ...

She is drop dead gorgeous like common
The standard of this conversation is no match with today’s interviews, in my opinion. Rekha is an absolutely charming person and so is sima

Oh Rekha ❤️ Favourite for all the time

She is damn beautiful

Her eyes looks so sad yet beautiful like a deer’s eyes

She took her life miseries like a joke... 😅

So many similarities between Jayalalithaa and Rekha.

Her lipstick shade ,oh my god
she&#39;s super strong!!!!!! she had a chance to complain and blame everyone who ruined her life with wrong choices and people who back stabbed her but she let it go!!!!! because she knew that it&#39;s absolutely baseless to complain they would not even understand her pain

I was so wrong about her until today.. I was so wrong😪  what a lady👏🙏💖My whole perception of her changed..  She is a gem🙏🙏 God bless u🙏

How time change to from then to now.. beautifully questioned and soothingly answered. Simi is all time best host. Rakha is gem

I never get tired of watching this vidoe.

<a href="">22:00</a> sach dekhlo iske Amitabh Bachchan chhaiye isko

Rekha speaks with depth. Simi can&#39;t get her level of answers.

Rekha is a Very Happy person..Blessed one💕

Rekha is such a Golden hearted Superstar..Superstar of Bollywood 💕

This bought tears to my eyes

Timeless!!

How brave she is... !!! Oh god,, she is best

I love you rekha ji
At the age of 13 she had this desire for marriage and children!? I don&#39;t know why I just can&#39;t put my finger on her... Simmi seems like not satisfied and curiosity on her statements.

honestly its all fabricated lies , to sound interesting or avoid saying the painful truth . she just keeps dodging every question with  answers of similar essence . definitely hurting and trying not to be bitter and accepting everything on a different level of consciousness.

Love you rekha mam🥰😘😘😘she&#39;s so beautiful
She is so stunning. Myyyy God!

<b>Iron lady</b>
actors and actresses from 70s, 80s and 90s have very good English accents Now days celebraties have very poor English accent In between I am a pure desi 😜

From viewing all 3 parts..I come to the conclusion that Raka is living almost a fantasy life....in denial of Real Life...making statements that are meant to confuse and only she has taken this &quot;higher road&quot; in life. Acting is still going on, but in real life...Simi&#39;s interviews are amazing though!

Painful <a href="">life.One</a> couldn&#39;t ever figure out what her life Was.Without a Father who could Love n a Mother to take care...She was a queen of Bollywood by her hardwork except for she did not do Sholay🙄.Just imagine the Personal trauma she had been through.She was a Bollywood beauty that every man craved for.God Bless you Rekha Amma 🙏🙏

The interview is more a competition between rekha ji and simi ji about who looks and behave more elegant ..and you&#39;ll notice that throughout the video ...rekha ji has &quot;ada&quot;

Evergreen beauty 👍Some are born with beauty and bliss naturally so are youGod bless you madam 👍Truly SOLOMON 🎭 the man behind the mask

The most beautiful and graceful, yet the fate betrayed her at every stage. She is broken at every level, yet so graceful and heavenly beautiful. I pray that she will get the life she truly deserve in the next life. I feel her pain. No one is as beautiful as you are in the ENTIRE Bollywood!

They are so beautiful

So beautiful and inspiring story of Rekha

Such a pretty lady with a strong heart🙏🏾

Life is so unfair! :(

Her eyes,voice and features are amazing. Simi looks much younger n cute

SIMI ji you must come up with a NEW SEASON of &quot;Rendezvous&quot; 🙏🙏🙏🙏

this women is my inspiration.

These two women are my ultimate Bollywood crush. This interview is a treat....

<a href="">10:10</a>

This show seriously needs to make a comeback and Simi Garewalji is an amazing host. She let&#39;s her guests finish. She understands their emotions and is very humble unlike other talk show hosts and this interview with Rekhaji is pure gold. Simiji talked about Rekha&#39;s personal life struggles with so much empathy and with utmost respect. Truly beautiful.

she’s literally so pretty omg

Rekha answers questions like a top politician.
Both ladies are elegant,gorgeous and so so soft spoken.

Great ki Rekha Hindi ke shabd bolti hai. I don&#39;t like the pretentious put on English accent at all. If that is an effort to sound sophisticated, then quite amiss. Rekha sounds perfect though.

The way she praised Savitri garu ❤️ SAVITRI AMMA

Simi ji is so gracious, elegant and charismatic...her dressing sense, her  voice , her  charm all are so way ahead of her time....such a magnificent and rare personality

Aishwariya has copied this, I just got the idea! Baat karny k style main jabi amitabh nay banaye bahu 😄
Rekha was my first crush as a child. To this day, she amazes and mesmerizes me

Best line- what happens between 2 people, who are we to say anything, everyone&#39;s mature enough....let it be...

The audio is 2 tonal…why? Like some digital effects but they have destroyed the audio actually. Can’t understand clearly

Her beauty is simply breathtaking!😵💖

Rekha&#39;s voice is just like koyal yrr

Is it just me, or does anyone else feel that she and Bachchan are probably secretly together?

Rekha is beautiful but an actress all in all. Nothing about her interview sounds genuine. Sad.

I&#39;m just mesmerised by the way in which they are speaking in English.

Beauty with brains.

She is gorgeous, beautiful both inside and out.

I keep watching this interview just out of sheer admiration. I think even as a man, a lot of other men in the comments would agree with me when I say that I admire Rekha’s strength and ability to reinvent herself. She has only gotten better at acting and has always been no nonsense as a person. Knowing someone like Rekha, given her past but also her sheer mettle and raw talent, gives me hope that it’s never too late to turn things around. Or live your life on your own terms. I love this interview so much because I feel like Rekha said everything she needed to, and Simi asked everything she wanted. You just have to read between the lines. Rekha knows how people are perceiving her, she knows where the questions are going and what would look like avoiding an answer. But she never lies. Verbally maybe, but she knows she’s telling you a different story with the way she looks or non verbally responds. Rekha isn’t graceful because it’s professional, she’s graceful because it’s practical. She already told everyone the truth to her life here, just listen to her story. Watch her. Even better, like all mentally ill people, she really knows how to crack witty, ironic  jokes while still indicating the truth of the matter. Love u Simi ma’am, love u Rekha! We hope to see both of u back on the screen, and will always appreciate your true selves.

Rekha you are satyam shivam sundaram but don't associate name with abhitab bachchan
What a beautiful and elegant women

Rekha is a good actress. She wearing sarees beautifully. Such a wonderful Lady

I love simi garavel voice. What a voice. Super..... B

Her voice and priyanka chopras voice, uff

Rakha Amma is so beautiful, gorgeous and Timeless beauty.  love her.

It’s so sad reading the comments in this video that so many view Rekha as a tragic figure simply because she doesn’t have a husband or children. Not every woman wants to have children or a husband and there’s a difference between being lonely and being alone. Rekha to me is a symbol of strength and courage, a woman who rose above a dysfunctional childhood, broken romances who had the courage to live life on her own terms in a patriarchal society. Rekha should be celebrated, not pitied. This is my thousand time watching this interview and with each viewing I learn something new about womanhood. ❤️ you Rekha and Queen Simi ❤️

These women amaze me they are like the epitome of womanhood so elegant and strong

Her story  emotionally is similar to jaya ji&#39;s story

She&#39;s look like a Bond girl to me

The Ultimate DIVA The Beautiful Actress

Simji is the best and noone can denied that love her ❤ and also 90s and 80s actress and actor was the best 👌 ❤

She is NOT underrated.

wtf is that &quot;south mein yeh chalta hai&quot; ? As if in the north everyone is a virgin. Dharmendra? oh yeh!

Rekha is undoubtedly an ageless beauty ❤ a complete woman one can aspire for😊 A gorgeous and graceful woman👩 A role model for many..

This was worth watching n worth listening

I love this beautiful  lady,  speak the truth ❤. Love  your self my dear.

I wonder why rekha copies big b all the time. She should be her original self . She lost chandni as nobody likes to see a copy cat and sridevi got the  role and she was amazing and fabulous.  Its so boring to see rekha copying others this is why she lost herself.

Rekha is so gorgeous, evergreen.

Namaste to All our Simi darling fans!!!Who wants Simi MDM come back!!! and one vote with like!!!!please I am requesting to all..please vote till  reach to Simi MDM.

Rekha still looks gorgeous. My favorite actress,Her best movie in my view is bahurani. Looks so beautiful in saree

Your show is so classy Simi ji. Thank you for bringing us The Ultimate Diva.

OMG!! She is soooo gorgeous!!!😍😍😍😍
I just wish someone had hugged her in her childhood and told her it&#39;s ok and comforted her. The whole conversation is... A little uncomfortable to watch because Rekha is like an image she has built for herself and you can no more know if a person exists beyond that image.💜

How can someone look not only beautiful but this hot at this age?? I mean she&#39;s the definition of timeless beauty.People like to dismiss it by crediting the makeup behind her beauty which is ridiculous because it&#39;s almost impossible for any other person to look this stunning even with all that makeup, dress and jewellery in that age. They might look just good but in case of Rekha, it&#39;s different. Only she can pull it off with grace. Great genetics I must say!!

This reminds me so much of Simi&#39;s interview with Jayalalitha. Both were successful strong Ladies who suffered extreme sadness in their lives...

Love the way she is...❤️❤️❤️
That mole is fake ..... Isn&#39;t it ? Does she put it on every day ?

How poetically she is speaking.wonderful❤️

She wasted her beautiful life in mad love of Amitabh nothing gainedAmithji selected his family leaving her alone

sixty yr old still looks sixteen

Kya sundar hai ,but overdressed in 2021

Rekhaji is so beautiful and bold lady handling her life lonely with all pride of a women.

Totally a fake lady😏

Rekha is Rekha for beauty 🙏

My god you can see how hurt Rekha was by her father&#39;s disinterest. It&#39;s hard to even hear her talking about it.

At <a href="">2:04</a> Simi asks Rekha do desires and dreams ever change...talking from personal experience desires and dreams never ever change they stay with you for life and grow old with you... until those dreams and desires are not fulfilled into reality one will always deep down have those same dreams and desires as they did decades and decades ago... however with passing time the wanting, pining and yearning for those desires decreases over time with age, but somewhere deep within you your dreams and desires keep growing with you and stay with you forever until and when they are actually fulfilled.

No words. Very few people get to live such a remarkable life. These are real actors, acting since 3 yr old. Not like these &#39;strugglers&#39; of today.

Both are so calm with smily face talking the baddest days of their life♥

How does she manage to look so attractive at this age

I HEAR AMITABH VOICE IN HER
All I could make out of this interview is that her father was ruined a lot of lives, pretty much of a narcissistic personality disorder. He really tricked a lot of foolish women...

Decent  lady

Rekha is so graceful.😍

Let me say what rekha didn&#39;t want to say. May be she didn&#39;t want to unnecessary bring controversies, which is very understandable.Gemini ganesan&#39;s 1st wife is his own cousin.they were married very early. Gemini got with many women later . He was a play boy. Pushpavalli, a telugu actress was an extra marital affair of Gemini. They were never married. She got pregnant , but Gemini didn&#39;t love her that he wants to take her as his wife. Gemini then fell in love with savithri, another telugu actress and married her. So, he had 2 wives. Bobji and savithri. It was allowed back then, as polygamy was banned only after 1956. Pushpavalli, mother of rekha, was never given a wife status by Gemini. That&#39;s why Gemini never cared for her children .. rekha and her sister. He just used her and didn&#39;t take responsibility.Rekha in this interview is being very careful not letting anyone know about all this. It could be that she is embarrassed about revealing all this. It&#39;s quite natural. But, she hated Gemini , her dad  which is true. Gemini didn&#39;t even know how rekha looked after being an adult. He one day saw her on cover page of a magazine and was asking someone next to him like &#39; who is this hottie?&#39; that&#39;s very very disgusting. He had a lot of partners even after becoming very very old.

<a href="">13:00</a> when she said that in punjabi with full expressions and proper Punjabi accent ...a south indian saying that ...i mean wow....

Yeah back then everyone spoke either Punjabi or Hindi because most of the people working in acting industry were Punjabis or had Punjabi background(musicians to actors ..all big names were punjabi).Dilip KumarDev AnandSahir LudhianviKapoorsDharmendra Balraj SahniJeetendraSunil DuttRajesh khannaYash ChopraRamesh SippyDavid DhawanVidhu Vinod ChopraKaran JoharSubhash GhaiDara Singh etc etcList is endless

U r so lucky that u r staying with Ur sister children , independent , rekhaji  u r like my sister  lalithac

Which year was this filmed?

You are diva,so feel happy, don&#39;t go behind supper star, because they used and throw but my concern is that ordinary man will make happy more than so called supper star

I guess Simi is not happy wid Rekha...her face shows thr fact🙂🙂

Who came here after watching TikTok video

Simi&#39;s voice is kind of ASMR to me..

Oh Rekha!!!  She is soo gorgeous!!

its 2021.she is more beautiful now.i love her so much

Wow such a elegant interviewer. Kudos to simi you have set a benchmark that no one will ever would be able to achieve

She is so gorgeous as a human being. Rekha.

A diva till date (2021) but a deprived personal life, No fathers love, wanted to married and have children but never married

she is such a great host . love her .

Rekha has taught me to always show respect even after all this pain. Lots of respect ma'am. 👏
Evergreen beauty evergreen voice
Perhaps the transparency in her thoughts makes her so different from any other actresses of her age. She is gorgeously intelligent in her own way. Lot to learn from such personality. 🙏

Everyone here after Indian idol 😂😂😂.......me too 😂
Rekha is no doubt beautiful But not vry honest talking about her parents

Great sharing!🙋🙋🙋 Must watch: Rekha rare photos😎🔥🔥

In her situation many would have killed themselves !! Industry is repeating it with Kangana now . Hope she fights it through like Rekha !!

I love you Rekha ji you r my themost favourite god bless you ❤️😘😘😘
Both are talking like contestants of a beauty pageant 😅

Love this woman...so muchhh.......you are deserve all the happiness

<a href="">12:23</a>

Simi is herself such a gorgeous lady.. Then comes Rekha. I have always felt pity for her

Rekha is literal goddess, I see her as my deity

Savithri kuda Malaga strong undi untee bagundedhi
After seeing thiz interview I feel always karma works out! Gemini ganeshan chesina mistakes and thanu savithri alone life  ki karnamayadu thana childhood lo father prema ledu Ani thanu ela badha padindhoo same rekha father undi kuda prema podalekapoyindi .  husband prem ki duram ayi alone life lead chesthundhi same  savithri ki Gemini  chesina papam rekha ki chuttukundi.but she is very strong leading her life after all thizz

She doesn&#39;t seem real. It looks like as if she is acting here as well.

OMG! Rekha ji gives me goosebumps. She tickles me with her style. What grace!!! Wait, she never went to school and she speaks this well?

I have seen pure girls with pure heart &amp; dreams like loving husband..marriage n babies dont get them but fake hollow gold diggers are mostly blessed with a loving man ..home..marriage everything..&amp; they abuse all these things for their own selfish motives.

She is gorgeous

She has daddy issues

She said south mai chalta hai ,not true u can’t have 3 mothers in south rubbish .I can sense Rekha is living in a fantasy world .

In Bollywood nowadays,there&#39;s no one as graceful as Rekha.Nor anyone as great a host as Simi.

south me yeh chalta hai????? wht is.she blabbering???

wow...what a great soul...I dont know if anyone else..can see it...she is extremely spiritual...and I think her soul has touched some great hights in the spiritual world....a truly blessed person and soul &lt;3

Simi garewal is all the warmth and elegance. Finest hostess ever.

Banu Rekha Jesus Christ loves u and died on the cross for ur sins. He rose from the dead and is still alive waiting for u talk to him read his word daily

Rekha ji is all about : earn everything in life time but still her hands are empty 🤲🏻 Sometimes life is very unfair 🙁

Gorgeous 😍😍 rehka love uuu lovers from sudan ❤❤❤❤
Lots of Respect for Rekha ji

If you listen to her parents story , it&#39;s no ones mistake and at the time they fell in love divorce was not possible to a married woman and that&#39;s y , Pushpavali could marry Gemini Ganesan , and thier love story does Remind me of radha Krishna&#39;s love , cuz they just dint want anything , no acceptance just love ❤️, it&#39;s just beautiful and we all should respect that 🙏

1.45  see her nose then. She has a better nose then. Plastic surgery made her nose looks like how her nose looks now. Plastic surgeons take a huge amount of money and spoil a  lot of people.

&quot;Anything filled with romance is not easy&quot;

Amazing Host...Your Voice is Mesmerising ❤️
Gorgeous, yes. But truthful, no! Rekha is too cautious of her every words. She knows well what will uptake her image. It is a talent too...

This was 2004 which means she was almost FIFTY here. My God, she was blessed with incredible genes. She looks F*****G amazing

What an honest lady!!!?



Two very beautiful ladies. Love them both.

Gam of bollywood

I dont know why she look like durga maa



She has suffered a lot but still has managed to keep her dignity and elegance. A true warrior...a true diva. My heart just broke when she mentioned about her dreams...

She is so humble and soft spoken, gentle and feminine....I love her always

Fakeness personified.. Mind blowing

Life can be so cruel.... Rekhaji was deprived of love and affection since birth.

The most beautiful actressYou are charmingJou are beautiful actress
Oh sundary that woman

Rekha clip from 20years ago seemed like she’s so happy and this interview doesn’t have that happiness and smile

What year was this?

Multi talented, quick learner, eloquent and heart broken.... that is Rekha . Amith Saab ditched her big time . There is no big secret .... s

Rekha&#39;s rendezvous is the bestest  of all

Rekha its gordeous

<a href="">15:10</a> &quot;ohhh&quot; exactly me at that moment 💕

Oh god what a goddess vibe she has. 💕🙌🏽 So deep and rich words 🌻

It is very very evident that the interviewer had not much respect for her, her facial expression and her rolling eyes and there&#39;s a valid reason for it..... If you watch this interview again and again, Rekha is contradicting herself after each statement....Infact she lying hands down.... I feel ashamed to watch it as her lies getting caught again and again She seemed to have an agenda to gather sympathy for her life, she&#39;s a great dancer actress etc, but as a human she is not very good.... Lying, deceiteful and cunning types, something about her that you get instant dislike.How can she generalise South India mein yeh sab chalta hai by her parents..... Not a mature thing to say.

Rekha ji didn&#39;t speak a single truth but her eyes said it all.

I pray for her long nd healthy life

I always  pray God to have an opportunity to see  my Goddess - Rekhaji.

Simiji pranam  l like. Rekhaji as a goddess. When l see her on screen my fingertips spontaneously touches forehead for salute nd say 1000 salute tujhko Rekhaji

For not having father figure; what&#39;s her fault. I felt the some sensitive points should not be touched.

A Real Women in every sense...Rekha has clearly an example for any women who been sidelined by male chauvinism... She broke the backbone of all Men who came across and she was highly cheated by all men..

So Successful yet so humble :)

Dear simmi, why you remember her that, dark and sad memories now, she is awesome, DIVA 🥰🥰🥰🥰

Lol guys, never Wright any of your feelings down.

Rekah went sad and uncomfortable there.

Rekha 0 Rekha it&#39;s all over your face. Why not just admit it. The woman on the left, is very sharp and cunning. No point denying it😬

Rekha  is  very  beautiful

She is gorgeous Rekha ji u

Simi is very elegant lady. She very well behaved even when Rekha said &quot; Are you mad?&quot; or many other things where her attitude was not very appropiate.

Interviews before were very elegant and truthful. Interviews now try hard to over sensationalise anything and everything.

breath taking beauty ..even after so many years.

Best of all rendezvous❤

It&#39;s universal truth that, those who always  love and wanted to be loved  will be left all alone . I don&#39;t know why this happens.  But it&#39;s fact . They have a huge vacuum to accept all the love in this world . They have ocean of love in their hearts to reciprocate .Still they are given nothing and they are got nothing . After all this they are flying high with their dreams their hopes and their love . LIFE IS IRONY . @<a href="">10:22</a> it breaks severely .

How could she not find love? She’s a beautiful human being, both inside and out... I’m so confused

Simi, Only two peoples answered your questions with truth are1. Jayalalitha2. LN Mittal familyMost Bollywood celebrities are giving foolish answers..something diplomatic. Not from their heart.  Stop interviewing Bollywood star kids they are not yet all star&#39;s...please interview big, inspiring personalities from all the field...so many are missing.. Great TeachersInspiring FormersDoctorsPolice Ex ArmyScientists Engineers Business mens/womensSocial servicesStartup stories DirectorsKind politicians .....many many fields ...no time..

Reka ji, I am glued to my android watching your harangue with the gorgeous Simi the presenter, listening to the deep  interaction highlights the tremendous courage and determination  that has made you what you are today, specially at such a minor age enduring family responsibility and doing every thing possible to keep the family in place,brings an impact of tremendous honour to you  Reka ji, you are a respectful lady with a great IRON fist. You really deserve a great striking applause and a Honour which is so deserving. Decades have passed by and  still you the same REKA we saw on screen many many years ago.All the way from Srilanka, Jacolyn.

Oh

Words Fall Short To Describe This Talk Show..  It&#39;s So Warm N Candid...  Hope Simiji Comes Back With A Bang,  The Way U Make Ur Guest Comfortable Is Commendable...  First n Last Talk Show Ever I Watched...  Hope To See You Soon...  The Best Rendezvous With Rekhaji,  Jayalalitha n Benazir Bhutto!.

Queen 👸
The simmi itself about to cry

i am sorry that your father was such a loser as a father.u deserved better, and he missed out!

Unbelievable and unbeatable  REKHA.She can beat anyone in everything in bollywood in terms of art n artists.

Rekha is an inspiration

I dont like this interview of Simi which is very wrong. she asked so many personal questions to rekha which made her uncomfortable. It is not her fault to be in this position.  She need not face these questions.

in that 20 years, she has maintained her beauty absolutely well...

Both gorgeouses are my style icon, being in my 20 , I am heads over heel fan of them,

Rekhaji is epsulittely genius  actor,everyone want to see  her, want to hear

Afraid of her age it seems. At this age it may be so.

I love you rakha maam. May God bless you more 🙏❤️😇
Good morning and happy Diwali she&#39;s always beautiful

Amithabh and Rekha Matched Well....... Jaya not at all.....

Rekhaji.ands simiji is the most popular and greatest artist

T0t

Where did we go wrong in all these years? The interviews these days in our country are all BS.

Any idea when was this interview taken?

Educated, full of sophistication, and gently articulate Rekha Ganesan continues to be an icon, quite towering over the men in her life. Great lady. Love this two-part interview.

&quot;A message to Amitabh Bachan:Love is anything but cowardly.If your heart hasn&#39;t opened enough to claim your feelings courageously and proudly,its nothing but a sickness that is feeding your lustful desires while hiding behind this honorable word called love.Love is something that gives life..it doesn&#39;t leave someone barren and wandering alone for the rest of their life.You dont use people in the name of love and there is nothing glorifying in it...its disturbing and sad

Looks ish

I have always liked. My childhood consisted of her movies,my mom acting and singing like her.

An amazing wisdom lady, Her beauty, her work, and now her wisdom will always remain—the Lady of many ladies. Time will heal all the pains, and she managed to darken them out. As a man watching this interview gives me many listens and gives lights of hopes! Long live, and happy remaining time in this world, lady Rekha❤️🙏🏻 Thank You for sharing this video.

<a href="">14:00</a>

She looks better than when she was a young girl or a young artist. I saw her on BBC without any makeup and she looks like simple Indian girls and she is soft-spoken, talented, and nice in heart listening to her interviews. Magazines, tabloids write or wrote all kinds of bullshits to make money, she sang Mehedi Hasa Gazal in that BBC Urdu service interview.

She is stronger than she seems I must say her soul is more beautiful than her physic

Rekha is the most beautiful lady. Her expressions the way she carries her self surely she deserves the title ma’am I’m gonna call her rekha Ma’am out of utmost respect

SATYAENDRA SIR MADE ME HERE

Sometimes a very successful person is brought down to earth.
Im crying

Rekha is so elegant and eloquent

this whole video is so asmr😂

I love you rekha a lot. How do u maintain urself so beautifully.  U look just soo soo much beautiful. Plz do gimme some tips. U and Simi too. Simi do come back again fast please. 😃😊😇👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻♥️❤❤🌹🌹🌹love ur show. Love u rekha. Ur my favorite.
I think actress Rekha had a rich life and wonderful childhood because her father was Tamil superstar Gemini ganesan but in this interview she revealed all her life. Rekhaji as a woman I love you very much all are told you are the real Indian beauty. Simiji super interview

Shez gorgeous
Rekha is lying repeatedly, she was hurt by her father immensely.

Simi ji, I have always found you very classy. My respect and regards to you.

Ok everything aside, both ladies have amazing makeup on..

Beautiful and elegant ❤️

Very graceful rekha

I met her 2003 or 4 may b silver saree  at airport expo dubai our diva she was taking a selfish nd like was just next to her

Nice 🙏💯💯🗡️🙏🙏
Dearest Simi ji 🤩🤩🤩....How long before you come back with your most ELEGANT presence.......l will keep pestering you till YOU DO🙏🙏🙏🙏......It is TIME to Come BACK and do what you do SO BEAUTIFULLY.....WE have LOVED YOU TO THE MOON and BACK.....PLEASE , I want to SWITCH ON MY TV once again.....Please ....Please....luv you 💓 💗 💛 💖 💕 💓

Two gorgeous legends!!!!❤️
This z how a host shd be...  decent ... lov u Rekha ji...

Rehka   gouges  flower   beautiful    best   actor   god  bless  you  long  life  with  out  any  problems  amen  best  luck  amen

It was &#39; between then &#39; ? You had a &#39; Relationship w/your Mum, Aunt &amp; Grandma - why not your Dad ?? Is it &#39; Hindu&#39;ism &#39; too ? You were a &#39; Girl Child &#39; , and they seem &#39; Undesirable &amp; Second Class &#39; ???

she isnt even accepting her marriage to vinod mehra, she got married thrice, n still amitabh bachchan is blamed to dump her. Very complicated woman i must say n  unsatisfied as well.

Is she single is yes I can understand why she is single?

She is so sweet thank god she got healed

Rekha&#39;s voice is so calm and  relaxing...

Is this an interview or therapy?

She is sooooo perfect, but sadly with imperfect life😞

I&#39;m an American who has never seen a Bollywood movie. This video came up in my suggestions. Never heard of this woman before. But she&#39;s one of the most stunning women I&#39;ve ever seen!

Rekha is adorable. Both Simi and Rekha possess such grace and elegance 🙏🏽

She is incredibly beautiful.

Poor Rekha
I don&#39;t know how to say,But there&#39;s this pitch calmness in Rekhaji&#39;s Voice. Which is serene♥️.

Two women who love children wanted to have but didn&#39;t have...

Hats off to Simi for doing her research and interviewing in such a graceful calm manner, however I felt that Rekha was not receiving the questions very well especially when she replied ‘Excuse me’ when asked about her marriage...surely she would have known that questions about her life would be raised and if she wasn’t comfortable answering questions of this nature don’t give an interview where you are in complete denial..you can tell this lady has experienced a lot in life and her coping mechanism was to shut out that part of her life..I enjoyed the discussion but would have preferred if Rekha would not have been so defensive/evaded questions..

When she responds to questions with &quot;I don&#39;t know Simmi... &quot;somehow you can understand it..

I believe that she is a very good actress but she spoils other people's house and destroys her own house. Rekha cheated with Jaya Bachchan so that her house would be happy.
Is it just me or do I feel Rekha ji &amp; Simi Maam look like mirror images in terms of body languages, personalities and the way they complete their sentences for the other!!

It is very sad that people say how classy this show is and at the same time use its comments section to bash other shows like koffee with karan

This interview seems like reading autobiography...great

My heart breaks after knowing about Rekha&#39;s life ...such a strong lady u r 😘

Simiji don&#39;t say savitrhi... Say savithramma savithri garu.. savithriji... She was the legendary actress of South India... Great actress.. mahanati..

Beautiful REKHA..one of a kind! Ultimate Fashionista, Diva, face of elegance of the sub continent.

What simi askng...n rekha answering.....she dont remember wat she written at 13 age....which ws turning point...fully fake

Simi ma&#39;am can you plz reply to my question? Were you really astonished when rekha denied the marriage? Had you warned her about the possibility of such questions?

I just ADORE both these gorgeous ladies 💕 They don&#39;t make them like this anymore...

This interview is so mesmerizing.... They both are gorgeous and their voices are music to my ears....

,,,,,, Lots of love,,,,,,, God bless you,,,,,,,, Kerala

Rekha is soo strong 🤔

This is beautiful talk show❤️

I came here after my english tutor said to see the interviews to improve my english and also we can learn how to handle that question and answer spontaneously.

At 55,she has that thick hair,wow

Rekha  I ur biggest fan
Rekha ji, when u said u only wanted to be married, have lots of children n have lots of love from someone who truly cared,at that tender age when u were pushed into films, u looked so sad... It almost moved me to tears.

There should be a biopic on Rekha&#39;s life.. such a genuine human being.. love her

When she said &quot;Loner&quot; even now that line broke my heart 💔

She looks exactly like her father(gg)

Lovely to be a part of a Wiccan convention! No way you two can be so very gorgeous all these years if not Wiccan!!! Really love you! Always had!

It is like this with me too, I can't find what I want, I can't find anyone who doesn't eat, whether it is career or marriage, everything is the same.
In which year you took this interview Simi Ma’am

She&#39;s so beautiful still

I used to think bad for men but since I got married, omg I can&#39;t tell you guys husband is better than me. Any day. Such a nice human being, passionate about everything, happy with your freedom to do anything, funny sometimes, inspires and consoles you time to time. I have the best no I have a great great husband. Love him beyond my life ❤️😍😘 you developed and cherished me Prashant. As I said I&#39;ll take the bullet in front of you. 🤓😅

I wish she would not hold and give an honest interview that would help a lot of young girls save their lives.

<a href="">20:35</a> Aishwarya Rai 🤭
<a href="">#Rekhaji</a> has Good Voice

Both are so artificial

Rekha....go find a man.

Why is nobody talking about simi Grewal beauty

Whos watching this after watching mahanati savithri if not watch it now to know true colours of that wicked cunning womaniser Mr Gemeni ganesh

Ok so totally floored, like OMG, she&#39;s so classy

Elegance personified..❤

OMG REKHA......Never knew of these things....YOU ARE THE BOLLYWOOD ICON. NO ONE CAN EVER REPLACE YOU. lOVE YOU AND ADORE YOU. SIMI.....YOU AND REKHA NEVER EVER GROW OLD !!

Such a lovely interview 💕💕💕
Mother and father's love is the most sacred and precious thing in the world... ❤🙏🏻
Tamil beauty :)

I have fantasy around rekha for around last half of 50 yrs

She does n,t seem less than a mystic speaking. A kind of Godly beauty. Who says worldly ppl are less than any  spiritual person

I like it Beautiful

After seeing this interview ,I have a huge respect for Rekha ji... She is still so so grateful abt every thing 💗 n look there are ppl with abandunce of comfort still complains... In the end I must say , the outcomes at the end ,n the way u choose to see things n life is important ... Dam important.. n that&#39;s what&#39;s make a difference .<a href="">#respect</a>.

I love the way you present it

Mam you need come back the show must go on

She says she is not educated but I feel she is intellectually very high than most of the so called educated heroines niow, and she speaks so well.  But she still is a closed book with lot of secrets not opening up on anything.We are just hearing what she wants us to hear but not what she actually feels within.

Her voice is so mesmerizing

She is still pretty alright but she seems to be loosing it a great deal

She is good at hiding her feelings. Very very good. Simi really tried hard to pinch her to let her reveal the real rekha but rekha was just too smart. I have always lived this show, but rekha dodged simi, absolutely. Otherwise simi is very skilled host.

So beautiful 😍
Her secrets goes with her.. None of the secrets spilled.. though Simi tried best.. She doesn&#39;t trust anyone. And we don&#39;t judge her

I really wish all the episodes come on the television it would be great...

The way she speaks, her thoughts, she seems to have lifted herself above earthly pleasures.

The brightest stars have the darkest stories.

I can see Aishwarya’s mannerisms.

Lot of pain her eyes...😪😪😪😪😪
She is more awakened and talks about things people are talking two decades later after her interview . ‘ the healing’ and all . She is so calm altho simi is intrusively digging.

Where r u Simi ji. Please be back😭.Be back with this grace warmth and the genuine interest to understand the person sitting across. We have lost this in the current world of sensationalism bytes n controversies which only offers us frivolous talks.. please be back pls🙏🏼

Is that a mole on her head or is it the  Indian thing some ladies  wear

These women look the same

She is not happy as a human being.

Thought i ll watch the show for 2 mins but ended up watching the entire show. Man she is an iron lady. I can only imagine how lonely her life was in her childhood and even now. Respect 👏

Why Simi ji feels more like a therapist talking than an interviewer ☺️

Sounds like child abuse

Her mother was so beautiful too

She&#39;s beautiful 😍
Rekha has always been honest real n mystical..❤️❤️❤️
I&#39;ve heard of Rekha - my parents talked about her but then again I was so engrossed with my own gen&#39;s actors and actresses but it&#39;s really interesting to see the previous generations stars and their perspectives.

Simi mam i love ur way of presenting .. ..and people are pleased to tell all their stories to you..

We are Indian, Agr ye baat chit hindi me hoti to bahut log isme shamil hote I throat 🙏🏻💐
Y to pull out her emotions?

Do u ever feel like this... Aishwarya Rai and Rekha&#39;s attitudes and face shape  similar. Rani Mukherjee &#39;s and JayaBachan&#39;s face and smile are similar. Amithabachan&#39;s wife  JayaBachan and abhishek bachan, the son of amithabachan... married Aishwarya Rai.

How beautiful she is ❤❤❤.

Ok so thers the plastic surgery...but how much more can  a person look better...Rekha is def a very gorgeous lady,even without the beauty regime Imo...she speaks good English...much better than most actors today...Amitabh Gemini had shattered her psychologically and emotionally...she must hurt alot...she deserves a good guy in her life.

She’s had a difficult life. She wants to fly because she feels bound and tied up, someone who never had freedom to voice her own opinion.

The best way to put tragedies aside and smile.

Rekha&#39;s an absolute sweetheart. Fact she mentored Sridevi and was so watchful and genuine, makes her golden

Love you rekha

Rekhaji...your eyes will tell everything...full of pain...pain..pain..Pain...

It has been 40 years almost

Omg she is so elegant. Queen of Bollywood

Yes mam Simi ji plz come back ....this kind of aura we aren&#39;t getting to experience these days....

Savitri amma 🙏
i am a 21yo girl who lives nowhere near india but i somehow stumbled upon this show and ive been mesmerized ever since. even if ive never heard about the guests, the way mrs. simi makes them open up and just speak such life stories along with a soft voice, its more than beautiful. many of this shows episodes touched my heart. thank you

Whenever I watch her interviews I feel life and god can be unfair . You can get everything except what you  exactly needed and wished. She is a ocean of tragedy and sorrow, yet she is a successful women 💕

All tears in eyes!True.. if you haven&#39;t tasted something, you don&#39;t know how it is!

We love savithramma pushpavalli Amma and Rekha madam... We don&#39;t like Gemini Ganeshan

Anchor don&#39;t say savithri... Say savithri ji or savithramma ....she is lagendory actress... Mahanati savithramma... And pushpavalli Amma... good...

How can someone be so vulnerable and so confident at the same time why I can sense the burried pain in her voice or it&#39;s just a effect ......I don&#39;t know why I felt that ease on her face is symbolic to a havoc

Looking at rekha speaking out about her life itself makes me teary

Rekha&#39;s beauty can never be expresses its beyond words

I saw alittle disconnect wen spoken abt the marriage wth Vinod mehra.. Either Rekha ws lying or Simi dint do her homework., Either ways, as a strong women tht Rekha is , she ws quite straightforward in sayin &quot;It wasn&#39;t imp&quot; &amp; Simi had to take it..

She was so guarded....I felt.

Miss Simi please bring your show back! I love your video&#39;s ❤️❤️❤️
Was she lying about Vinod Mehera?

Anyone in quarantine 2020
She is daughter of Tamil actor Gemini ganesan..many Bollywood actresses came from Tamil Nadu..Vyjayanthi mala, hemamalini, Sridevi, Meenakshi sesathri, Vidya Balan, Rekha Gemini Ganesan

How she&#39;s trying hard to seep her tears.

Rekha yuur father was an asshole and not a charmer.

How properly is grief organised. Not a single tear shed. I like you Rekha

Rekha jee is a twin flame

Such a well spoken lady rekha is!

Simi mam...

Very grounded,discipline speaks her mind lot of sadness from long time ago I see her she was in love with only one person in her life ,but never got him only ment for him .shes versatile actress ,a real Diva better than Hema malini, and shri devi.

Grown up with her songs ❤️..She is really an Ultimate Diva

What a lady!! Perfection personified. ❤️ she deserved all the happiness in the world. 😞

Why didn’t this women ever adopt children, or become puppet or go on long vacations. Movies made and broke her.

Wow I&#39;ve never met her , heard her in conversation. Thanks Simi Garewal....for this

Such a complete passionate woman with so many unfulfilled wishes yet.  Life was so unfair to Rekha.  She deserved her own man and home so much.

I never told anybody what I feel. ❤️💔❤️

Dear Rekha ji, you belong to a class of those emotional and intellectual humans that are going extinct. Love and regards for you and your journey.

Lamboo ji should have marry Rekha , somewhere deep down in Lamboo’s heart he still misses Rekha so much

How will she reveal d truth? Vinod Mehra had wife &amp; children.Amitabh also hv fmly...she dont dare to talk abt her affairs with them...maybe she want to protect their fmly

No marriage with Vinod Mehra??but director Saawan Kumar, Vinod&#39;s neighbour revealed tht they were very mch in love.Vinod was d only man who loved her very sincerely &amp; they got married with the help of Moushami Chatterjee&#39;s husband.

That is wat is called beauty

Night queen.ctg.
Thanks you for all these beautiful episodes.   I love listening to people&#39;s stories, to learn about why they succeeded,  failed, lessons they&#39;ve learned, how they picked themselves up, and forged ahead!  I hope that all these lessons makes me a better person... Thank you ma&#39;am.  -from your fan here in Nigeria!

I&#39;m suprised how honest she is and well spoken but she has a sadness to her

Gemini the man right or wrong but his child 6 girl 1 boy they are very genuine they are lead good relationship. That&#39;s the gift for three mother&#39;s

So beautiful Evergreen Actress😍😍❤❤
Oh my god..... I dont knw why but i really can feel her...life can be unfair sometimes!!!! And rekhaji....respect...courageous and dignified woman... 🤗 And also she is damn gorgeous 😍

She is a complete woman. Strong , wants to give lots of love to someone worthy , has a heart filled with secrets , pain , love . I am not a fan but I respect her very much. That father of her tried his best to screw her up for good......but she fought it. Respect ma&#39;am ❤️

She was not beautiful earlier.

Some of the greatest Mysteries in Life is how some of us can be so Wronged in Life but move on. Love is an illusion. Don’t get trapped by it. True Love means a tear for a tear, a shoulder to cry on, someone to ask you whether you’re okay and most of all the bond that can never be broken. It’s Sad that many People like her look for that but end up with nothing in the end.

So much sadness in her eyes

She is a beauty....

Inspiration.... truly ♥️
Savitri amma..❤
Can she tell me how she healed I too want to heal

The class, sophistication and soul searching in this interview is almost unbelievable. It flowed like a poem composed out of melancholy and bittersweet memories, yet it&#39;s strangely healing and heartwarming. It&#39;s a standard for how a candid interview should flow.

I like your way of speech.

I think Rekha lied on purpose about her relationship with Amitabh.

Jzz mesmerised by the way they&#39;re talking😍....how difficult her life had been

They&#39;re sooooo elegant. Aspiration 101

That beauty spot is so perfect.

she is hiding a lot of secrets. she didnt let one out  no mattery how hard simi tried.

Rekha, its hit me here ❤️

Am watching this for second time... M really not tired of watching Rekha.... She is wonderful

Rekha is indeed a very strong Woman, She is down to Earth , Humble and Full of Love to give, She is well Read, poetic, Romantic at heart still.. After what happened to her and all that public humiliation , Read her biography , industry people labelling her too, Husbands death and so much more, she still Smiles. How many cases do we know back in the day and even more today where Women committed suicide because of their Loneliness , Breakups, divorces etc.But she stayed strong despite the humiliation hats off to her courage, Havent seen her more transparent than this. Good show Good interview. So Real !

Anyone in 2020?

I will forever love Rekha, she’s one of the most beautiful ppl in the world, even as of today.❤️

What makes me most wonder is how Rekha could not settle for a decent husband from an average family, good income and charismatic personality. While I do believe she was hungover with Amitabh Bachchan for most of her youth but she wasn&#39;t that old when she married Mukesh.

I think the Rekha of today is far more guarded in words, very diplomatic...the old interview of 1984 shows how true and clear she was , it is in the eyes.

Her father was a rascal.... entire south india knows that

I born in Artificial generation Past❤❤❤❤❤❤
I had come across this show a while ago and the first episode I watched was the interview with Benazir Bhutto. I was really mesmerized by the host’s way of conducting the interview. She is definitely one of a kind and if a classy, dignified and sophisticated show like this were to be aired on TV in today’s date, I would definitely start watching TV again. The aura of the host is really captivating. God bless. Love listening to these interviews.

I think this woman is completely deluded about the relationships in her family. Her father clearly neglected her and she seems unable to see it or even acknowledge it honestly.

She doesn’t look real it’s look she is acting between her interview

Really Rekha is great spirit.. I love her all films

A heart-broken lady who always searched for a true love and protection but always got deceived from every side.

Rekha, her mother and her sister were the ones who suffered a lot because of Gemini Ganeshan... as he looked after his first wife who was legally married to him with his parents&#39; advice and Savithri madam whom he loved dearly ... and there children eventhough later he was separated from Savithri amma. But the suffered ones are Rekha&#39;s family.She had to act to earn a living even at a very young age and also she didn&#39;t taste the love of a father. She lived literally like a fatherless child. Her eyes were filled with  tears when she mentioned about her father coming to school to drop the other children...and never noticing her.

We can understand she needs be live like a normal human life . You are great women rekka madam 💖

First few minutes of the interview,Simi is trying to wrap her head around the weird family setup!

Rekha Gnesan is great of film industry

The name of that person is Badi Kutti Cheej.
Who is here after watching Mahanati?

This session seems like a healing session to visit the past pain and acknowledge it and let go off as an experience and forgive who may have hurt or get hurt in the process.

old  is  gold  but gold is rekha

<a href="">04:43</a> haaaaaaaa

💟SIMI
My favorite actress !!! It’s a pity that he doesn’t have children!!! It was necessary to get a child from a loved one!! Namely Amitab Batchana!!!!
she speaks good English with little accent,must have had a good education.she had a rare combo of both beauty and grace.Her movies depicted such traits.

She is unlucky in terms of men in her life

Tears in her eyes
<a href="">10:14</a> - <a href="">10:40</a> 💔
The pain in her eyes is killing me

Rekha looks awesome and stylish in simple dress and with out make up. Jewellery does not suit her.

Feel sad for her 💔

Rekha is gold!!But lately I&#39;m liking Simi so much,how calm and compose she is she amazing too..❤️

Sushmita Sen and Rekha seems to be soul sisters who shares similar life lessons and values.

Rekha’s voice is really good 🙂

2020

Daddy issues.

Acceptance is enlightening.

I know the face of struggle and suffering when I see one. She has seen it all. The good the bad and the ugly. Nobody, love to relive those times.

come back here after waching &quot;mahanati&quot;.... u will relate to her savitramma

What a great interview..! Her way of interviewing is great.. Very civilised

Kash ye hindi me hota to acha hota 😔
It&#39;s lovely to hear her .

her voice is so sharp.

My question to this pretentious and hypocritical Simi Garewal is... why didn’t she ask this question about the affair with amitabh.. when mr Bachchan had come down with his wife? Is it because he comes with his wife painting a familial picture? Whereas; she comes here- a single woman- which Indians have a problem with attaching an image to Rekha and her strong and single persona. How convenient and disgusting ms Simi!!!!

Rekha could have become like miss havinsham...someone who despised the world...yet she chose the opposite...such elegance and beauty

<a href="">10:02</a> <a href="">10:10</a> No Never

It&#39;s sad not knowing a father&#39;s love. You can see its hurts and difficult to express.

Beauty epitomized , grace comes alive...<a href="">#Rekha</a> mam ! ❤ ❤ ❤
Karma returning back !  A classical example of Karma returning back. Never try to take away another person&#39;s &quot;food&quot;. You will NEVER get happiness. She looks sad. Desperately sad. Amitabh also faced his Karma. Amitabh also is in the same pathetic condition. What goes around comes around. Good luck in the future, Rekha.

In those days my wife and I never miss Simi  show.Of course, in my bachelor days I had seen the film Sidhartha  in Liberty cinema Bombay after  having seen the photos of her and Shashi Kapoor in Illustrated Weekly of India.. Watching this episode  after becoming a father and showering affection on my daughter and son and to my grand daughter and grandson I literally became emotional to the 13 year old girl child of Pushpavalli and Ganesan .Pushpavalli who acted in Samsaram Tamil film and asked her children to beg after her husband left her reminds me now that same Pushpavalli had to ask her daughter to act in film to earn money. In the seventies her affair with Vinod Mehra and suicidal attempt and later newspaper report that she ate Upma which had cockroach  etc are well known.I was a bachelor then and used to read all film magazines like Screen,Star&amp;style and filmfare.I pray God no child boy or girl should have the experience of growing up without love&amp;care of both the parents.Divorce terrible disease.

As a South Indian, I&#39;ve always wondered whether Rekha has ever mentioned why she never acted in the south but went directly to Bollywood? After all, she did say that she didn&#39;t know the language either and had to learn it all. I would think being the daughter of Gemini Ganesan and Pushpavalli may have opened doors once he acknowledged that the girls were his.... perhaps that&#39;s the answer itself.

Rekha has gone above and beyond. 💓

<a href="">15:55</a> sec 😔But then ... <a href="">17:07</a> sec 💜

Rekha seems so in denial of her past, I feel like all the bad things eventually got to her and now she&#39;s broken, hiding behind the &quot;healed&quot; façade.

She is an awesome actress

Kangana ranaut is like Rekha , I could see similarities

Having watched the movie Mahanati about the great actress Savitri..It’s interesting to get to know other side of the story ..The movie failed to show how the other women suffered! Also it was very common back then, for upper caste men &amp; men belonging to elite families to have mistresses! Women willingly fell for such men ... !

In my eyes I have seen eternal beauty. Love you mam
Its 2020 already

I wish she would have married to amitabh

Simi aunty she is just wow trurly a icon must say.... she have a sensuous voice talking abt rekha aunty!!! She is very strong ldy inside out she is open book but still a mastery!!!

Lots of respect to simmi Ji.for such wonderful <a href="">interviews.zero</a> % nonsense.

I love rekha so much
Simi how can i write or talk to rekha...??

Watching ,this is 13th January 2020.Feeling in love with Rekha...downloaded and watching again and again...love from pakistan rekha

2020 anyone?

Lov u rekha 3000 times... 2 elegant ladies.
She is still hot , bless

Still hot . The hotest of all bless

Is polygamy excepted in South or is it just some societies og South India that accept it? Genuinely curious, here.

Recently watched Tabassum talkies&#39; episode on Rekha. Rekha lied here about Vinod Mehra because Tabassumji tells you the truth on that.

2020 anyone?

Rekhaji is not at all happy with her questions

Jaley pe namak

Anyone in 2020

Omg.. can&#39;t get a true answer..rekha is really a tough nut.. even JJ ji interview looked believable n JJ s answer were genuine.. 👌

Rekha lies often. She is a superb actress no doubts. Acts very well in real life too. Contradicts her own statements and lies about Marriages.. well done. Still a beautiful heroine.

These actresses and their bubble of self-denial and distorted lifestyle being aired to softly introduce to us as the new standards and norms in the society...good accents, good clothes cant hide the truth or reality it eventually comes out that bastard children are result of an unapproved way of life, they are discarded by such loony parents and then forced into a lifestyle of a lost kid subjected to exploitation...some people desperate for money still exploit their kids its a shameful side of glitz and glamour

both looks and talk abnormal

I relate to her when she said i am selfconcious around men

Rekha and Aishwarya Rai should play mother and daughter.

Rheka..the independent,  beautiful woman ..not shy to speak out her heart and soul....its how every woman wants to be ..but scared to be..

What a terrible father she had

Rekha speaks far better English than the modern day celebrities. Hands Down !!

Very appropriate questions and explanation by Rekha mam

Watched real Rekha in 2019 dec  : ohhh

She&#39;s a mysterious creature❤️✨ People can&#39;t resist falling in love with her charming personality. Love you Rekha ma&#39;am. Wish if you and Amitabh Sir had married, such perfect couple!💗💗💖💖
Hi mam I&#39;m from Tamilnadu.. I really admire you for the way you put your questions u r one awesome woman... Lots of love mam... These days no one bother speaking nonsense in their shows... Urs is what is perfect

Dear Simiji, the description you provided in this vedio about Rekhaji is so apt! I think more than any of us audiences could ever able to describe her, you did it so perfectly. As you are someone who knows her personally and of course the insight and impeccable human understanding you have is unparalleled. The way you let your guests to open up their shells in most beautiful ways, it&#39;s so heartening. I love it what you write about each guest in these vedioes description and the brief intro you gave in beginning. It is a natural and humane touch to your interviews otherwise todays noisy chat shows are just looking for breaking news stuff, hosts filled with prejudices and fakeness. It is a pain to even watch them.But Rendezvous is so natural, unpolluted, flawless, so so captivating and like a breath of fresh air only because of you and your charming persona! Rendezvous will always have special place in my heart.  💕

It&#39;s a women&#39;s world back in 1984 and then this rendezvous in 2004, exact 20 years later, a lot has changed but these two elegant women are almost same, beautiful, intelligent and a treat to watch. I wish in 2024 also they sit back again after 20 years of this rendezvous and talk about life, love and everything else. There is a lot to learn from them. The screen gets lightened up with their mere presence. Honestly these ladies have defied ageing. I request and wish for another classy show like rendezvous with Simi Madam and of course first guest my favourite Rekha Madam :) Since you are friends with her, if you happen to meet or call her anytime please tell her how much we admire and love her for what a beautiful human being she is. I wish all the happiness to her.It&#39;s a treasure to watch this show on YouTube now because i was not even born then when this interview aired. Thank you to Youtube and of course Simi Madam. You have no idea how special is rendezvous to us 🙏🏻💕

Shes a majestic creature bollywood is not good enough for her

HI ,Raka ,you are looking gorgeous  at your <a href="">age.you</a> were my fanticy girl growing up in Guyana in the west although  you are old enough to be  my mother.i wish you the best of good health and you will always  be loved by the people of the west indies.

Love her lipstick
Aap Manoj Kumar aka Bharat Kumar ka interview kb logi Simi ji
Rekha Didi, leave the whole world and come, your younger brother is waiting for you.
Rekhaji is just eternal ❤

Money doesn't matter much. Life can be so difficult. It's a pity to see. How many people have cried from the other side of the world.
<a href="">11:20</a> it would have been nice if they really showed all the advertisements

Watching today  Nov 23 ‘2019 😊😎

Without make up she looks soo beautiful

I wonder why i felt like that....How cruel this world...

Greetings CMji, I am very happy to see you sitting with a film university like Rekhaji. My salute to Rekhaji also.
This is just so sad. Not having a proper childhood, being pressurised to do a job she didn&#39;t like, unrequited love,repressed feelings, lack of paternal affection or even minute attention. But I have a huge respect for this lady for holding up like this. We can feel her crying inside.

10.24 I feel her ...her dream never full fill but that&#39;s not so big and difficult dream that&#39;s can&#39;t full fill !!! normally people had this things but she  deprived from normal life ....fathers love ,husband love ,child love even she not get mother and brother love properly 😢

My love

Nice

Omg rekha have a very difficult life first no father then no husband and now no son, she supported her family n sacrificed herself for them.

I guess this is pain. More than her words, her eyes flash pain.

Simi hit a nerve when she said that Rekha’s mother wasn’t married to her father.

Nice voice rekha ji

so sad , that era of true beauty and class is gone //// u can see her beauty in her but her eyes tell a different story really feel sorry for her hope she finds peace she deserves it

she is so lovely...

real inside and outside beauty

Even in spite of everything..., think about the past which you remember and you are alive... but this skill is not there for everyone... you love life like this.
&quot; i dont think he noticed me&quot; ....  who??...my father ...😡arre..wahh..kya father hai??WTF???..😠😠

She is a lady who knows how to love.

Her makeup is to die for 😭😭😭😭❤❤❤
her words r like poem &lt;3

Now I’m really angry with Gemini Ganesan and Savithri ! She is such a great soul😥

Matured talk about her family. Hats off

Watching this rendezvous, I&#39;m feeling confident and her words are really helping me. I&#39;ve gone through so much pain and suffering. Thank you Simi ji ,it is through you we knowing their struggles, and I really feel emphatic towards her.

English accent was wow..  two great actress it&#39;s a institute of advanced studies in education and experiences and skills to the best way to the best

She is so mesmerising. ❤️ Beautiful, poised, elegant and very smart.

two gracious ladies defying age...what a Rendezvous!!! One of its kind.

Rekha looks like transgender..I don&#39;t find her beautiful

I have lost the count of how many times I have watched this particular rendezvous with The Rekha.She is someone who is beyond explainable, a true diva, a woman of substance!Thank you Simiji for making her comfortable and took so much out of her heart. She has never poured her heart out like this before. What a beautiful conversation between two elegant and gracious women.

Life is so harsh 🤧

watching this interview in October 2019!!! Still mesmerized.❤️❤️

I feel so emotional watching this.

Both are looking same

I love the way you take interviews mam. Can we see you taking interviews of these legendary people again.?

10.09-10.39......

Beautiful lady

I find similarity between Rehkaji and Aishwarya rai

both women breath taking beauties with brain

Rekha&#39;s father and amitavh bacchan made her believe all men in this world are nothing but pigs walking around with two legs and two balls without a spinal cord😒😒😒 I hope she find peace in her life each day, she deserves it❤

You interviewed many stars simi in your show..but you didn&#39;t interviewed sridevi .....i think you must have approached her but since she was shy and introvert she must not have come....

REKHA, UR da boom! You should be clone. As the saying goes. If you can&#39;t handle the stress. You can&#39;t handle the success. HALLELUJAH!! GIRL, you got a huge LOVING HEART. More BLESSING TO YOU. UR ONE OF KIND. LOVE AND MUCH LOVE TO EVERYONE.

Always stay BLISSFUL REKHA JI &amp; SIMI JI ....
These eyes are crazy about the fun, there are thousands of them..chorus
You are very dear Rekha ma'am..☺❤️love me
She has gone through so much. But still she is the best

A LOT of bullshit FAKE personality

Petition to bring back this show 🧡

Rekha is always beautiful💕👌
If simmy talk in hindi that would b better to understand and feel the  the feeling of rekha g becouse we are indian and there are so many people who dont understand english.

She is the personification of sheer substance, elegance, strength and Bollywood splendour

Life is hard on some people.

I feel She is very self centered person.

Depression looks like this. ☝️

It is so strange, Simi asks Rekha about her love affair with Amitabh Bachchan and pulls a face when she denies meeting him at a friends&#39; place for their dalliance. Now, she didn&#39;t ask the same question to Bachchan when he appeared on her show with his family. Also, one can see her utmost respect for the Bachchans but dropped guard when talking to Rekha.

nice rekha😭😭😭😭😭😭
So painful
Her mother is pushpavalli Telugu... Father Gemini ganeshan Tamil..
