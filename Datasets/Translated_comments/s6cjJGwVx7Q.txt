Ranbir and Amitabh are superb actors....and they are both together....you have boycotted Tamasha...and after watching in internetall comments were &quot;tamasha is masterpiece i don&#39;t know why it became a flop&quot;.....again do it cause the director¬¥s actors efforts are nothing....so guys boycott Karan johar but not the efforts of actors like Ranbir and Amitabh...

Avoid this garbage. Don‚Äôt see don‚Äôt support these cheap people.

Dekho sablok future of sadak 2...

We should never watch this film. In this film, the actual story of Vyad Vyas of Mahabharata has been mentioned in a very wrong manner. Who said that Brahmastra is the god of all astra? Pashupatastra, Brahmashirsha astra, Narayanastra - all these astras were more powerful than Brahmastra - the actual Mahabharata was written like this, no man knows these things. Mainly, Arjun had the knowledge of Pashupatasra and Brahmashirsha astra, Ashwatthama had the partial knowledge of Brahmashirsha astra and complete knowledge of Narayanastra. But Brahmastra was somewhere near the warrior. Who said that Arjun's Brahmastra was neutralized by Brahmastra Chodkar? Due to the curse of Lord Parshuram, Karan had learned the Brahmastra and Arjun could never cross the Brahmastra. Mahabharata is a beautiful story. It is not right to attribute any element of this story to the war of Kurukshetra as a falsehood. These foolish people, in their quest to earn money, do not even kill thousands of years of old love stories. By making a story in the last sidhi maan, you can also see something or deceive the public. By the way, one cannot expect the best attitude from a religious production house like Dharma Productions.
Vogous.

Better don&#39;t release this film with same old  actors.

Superior Astra is not Brahamastra. Its Shiva&#39;s own Shiv Pasupatastra and it&#39;s locked by Lord. Shiva himself for Kaliyuga period.

When it will release

Flop hai movie

What a fake.. real bhramastra is with Lord Hanuman given to him by Bhramadev who he is still alive on this planet waiting  for Lord Krishna&#39;s last avtar...
