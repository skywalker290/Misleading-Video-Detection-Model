After 4 whole years I finally obtained this phone 🫡

I just got this as a gift yesterday

<a href="">1:13</a> is bro gliding?

2024 revisited

Watching this to make my iphone 11pro max feel brandnew

Looking forward to get it

Hi Love

<a href="">14:01</a> 😮
Nice! I am planning on purchasing a refurbished version of this and wanted to look at how it is. Helped me a lot!

Shame they won’t bring back that beautiful green color every year.

Still my favorite design in all apple&#39;s line up

Still think greatest cold open MKBHD has done 👌🏾👌🏾

Watching on iPhone 11 Pro

Still using my 11 ProMax after four years, and am honestly finding it difficult to find a reason to upgrade to the 15.

Getting mine soon😊

Bought a refurbished one for 320€ today! I was using an IPhone 7 before this with a maximum battery capacity of 60%. So I&#39;m really excited to be able to get through a day without charging my phone 3 times. You&#39;re video&#39;s helped a lot with deciding, so thanks for the awesome reviewes!

Watching this on a 15 pro max

I’m watching this on iPhone 11 Pro Max lol 😂

now with the 15 out, the camera bump back then looks kinda of awkward

<a href="">14:05</a> crazy that none of that came back to the 12 pros. 😂 Apple had him hyped for nothing.

“Coming soon”🤡
Who’s here watching after getting their IPhone 15pro ? 😂

The one on the 15 pro max is HUGE (which I don’t mind anymore). Can you believe we got mad at this?

Watching right now on my iphone 11 pro which I bought last month hahahaha

The 11 aged so well

Great phone, bro. This dude is a genius and a very good civilized guy and good looking too lol.

I am watching this in 2023 on my iphone11 pro contemplating upgrading to iPhone 15 pro All I can feel in gratitude for universe and feel abundant. Thank you

Believe me! This was the best Pro iPhone version Apple ever made..😊

<a href="">4:53</a> This is the feature he said he really misses. One he never used much.

Watching this on my 15 pro max. Time flies.

Watching this on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and realizing how far we come

Watching this so my 11 pro max would feel like new

Doesnt that camera bump look reasonable now.

People back in the day really thought it wasn’t much of a step up. 4 years later, this phone is LEAGUES better than the XS

Shit this was in 2019

Watching this 4 years later as a reality check before buying the 15 pro. I can’t see enough of a difference to justify upgrading 😅

Just the intro was incredible!

bro how did he know that promotion was going to be called pro motion wtfff

Her King
I like to watch mkhd great videos so much :]

H    i

Me watching this on a iPhone 11 Pro 3 years later

Amazing intro
2023,still can&#39;t afford this but here watching again. 🌚

Underrated Video…

This might sound silly but even almost 4 years later this video feels legendary to me. The intro is fantastic, the on screen graphics look great and are well animated, and the actual content is incredibly engaging even though it&#39;s about a phone that&#39;s been out of production for almost 3 years. Not to mention that, in my mind, the iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max was the start of the iPhone being straight up better than nearly everything else every year (I still prefer android by a lot but it&#39;s hard to argue against the fact that every iphone since 2019 has been an absolute beast)

I sill used my 11 pro I still love it And I notice your bigggg hand I like big hand guy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hi

Was my dream phone in 2019, now in 2023 I finally bought one today after my 13’s screen died on me 😂 but damn it’s fast, especially for a phone that’s almost 4 years old.

Glass is glass mine crack 😂

WHO ELSE IS WATCHING THIS 4 YEARS LATER BECAUSE WE JUST GOT IT

Now i can afford this 🏃

Watching after 3yrs

Who else is watching this because they are getting one soon 😂😂😂

Finally I bought it😭

I watched this cause you look good and talk well❤❤❤❤

Me in 2023 after the IPhone 14 came out glad I can finally afford this phone.

Is it water resistant?

years have passed away and i finally got to buy my iphone 11 pro max 😅

<a href="">3:56</a> Marques: RIP 3D Touch

4 years later and I might be able to buy one

Watching it on iphone 11 pro max in 2023. I just sold my iphone 12 pro max and went back to this one. Battery is madness even camera is quality even now.

Anyone else watching in 2023?<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a>

Now I can afford the 11pro, it’s coming in tomorrow.

Wow

I can’t wait for my phone to arrive

Still no type c

Seeing lag in your video intro for the first time.. 😆

That puppy though

Do i need i phone yesCan i afford noSo do i really need no🤣

I know I’m late but I’m about to get me self 11 pro

<a href="">6:39</a> That&#39;s the biggest flex a tech youtuber could ever have

Have the 13 PM. That camera bump is crazy large

Fun Fact: you can disable the ultra wide preview thing he talks about and wants to remove, its called “View Outside the Frame” in the camera settings

I personally got the standard iPhone 11, and that was because I prefer the cheaper model and the extra camera isn’t necessary for me because the cameras on the regular iPhone 11 are still really good.

having a iphone 14 pro and looking at this video is crazy💀💀

Crazy how small that camera square looks in 2022!

Still rocking this thing, will try to keep it for 4 years. 💯

Bro I can’t believe it’s already been 3 years since the 11 was released!!

What confuses me is the normal iPhone 11 has a bigger screen than the 11 pro 🤔

I have to watch this video 3 years after just cuz i can afford it now

iPhone 11 pro: “huge” camera bumpiPhone 14 pro: Hold my beer
This is the best phone review channel on youtube. Keep it up!

Guys please don’t buy Apple product My newly purchased 13 pro max screen becomes dead within one month.Many people having the same issues.Apple product no reliability.You will loose your money

watching this as the iphone 14 is being sold, jesus the camera looks so small

this phone looks weird nowadays, the camera looks off for some reason

Rewatching on 11 Pro to feel like I have the flagship 14 Pros

Watching it on my georgous iPhone 11 Pro after the annoucement of iPhone 14 and Pro. The decision will be made soon 😂

I love his intros

Get to the point like turn turn off T0o long to get to the point lock unlock

I wish apple would go back to the rounded sides. I upgraded to the 12 pro when it launched as I thought it looked super clean. But the flat sides are nowhere close to the comfort of the 11s

is this still worth it in 2022? :)

I am not book smart but street smart yes!!!this young fella smart about these phones!!!Very Very good presentation sir

why when making/taking a video….there IS NOT a pause button Friend has one those POS galaxies and when making/taking vids he can pause then unpause and pick right up as if it was 1 continuous recording which makes me want to change over

Just upgraded to the iPhone 11pro from iPhone 8 and I love it!!!

The reason Apple slightly lowers the volume buttons is to prevent you from using your old case, so you are forced to spend money on a new case. They dont want to change the design too much because they are afraid to lose customers to fear of change, so this is why they do it.Also, I would never pay that much money for a flimsy little case like Dbrand Gripcase. Thats a joke.

Lov ur videos Who’s watching this in 2022 💕

The intro song should be a part of a villain entrance in a movie/show. anyone agree?

Looking back at this the only reason i got the pro instade of the normal iphone 11 is the screen OLED panels are unbeatable

DUMB

Wait untill he sees the iphone 13 pro max battery life

just bought used for $495 today!

I&#39;m watching this because I&#39;m getting mine soon lol

You are cute.

Ummmm.. was the dog posing for the picture?? Lolol

<b>They took two iPhones later to make your predictions.</b>

It’s was a nice $300 discount to get this phone now even though it’s still ridiculously expensive costing me $800 and will still have many years to go, the only thing I hate about this phone is no 5g, but we’ll just like with 4g in the past of LTE, there’s going to be a better version of 5g in the future it was a sweet upgrade coming from the 6s Plus

Tari mani biki

2022 and a broken iPhone 8 Plus brought me here

I like watching stuff that I can afford in 2022

cool

The damm record player scooching back in!!

Still worthy in 2022? Thanks!

I like your videos, I also own a 2022 Tesla M3, upgraded from a 2021.

You can actually turn on &amp; off the ultra wide preview shot in camera settings lol

How many of yall are watching just because you want it cause i am

After 2 years i still cant afford it

I’m watching this in 2022 on my 11 pro 😍

I’m gonna get this before I turned 23 😬

I got this phone a few years ago when I switched to Xfinity Mobile. I got it t just to try iPhone after having Android for over 10 years. I wasn&#39;t disappointed with this device but after a few months I did miss my Samsung as the iPhone couldn&#39;t do a few things that Android could (main thing being not able to connect USB storage device for file transfers). Went back to Samsung and got the S22 Ultra.

Getting this in a bit so thanks for letting me partly know what i&#39;m in for lol

wsh

This is the phone that’s the best for me. I would buy it even if it’s 20 years from now instead of all the new phones that would come out fr

You just add the word Pro then the cost goes up 300 to 400$ more

Mm mm mmmm that intro was smoooooth

just went from  the  8plus to this

Anyone knows the intro song name?

Why does it look like he was reviewing the Pro Max instead of the Pro? The phone did look a little bit bigger tho....

Watching this in 2022 it&#39;s funny to see how small that camera bump is😶

Me after saving 4k
Finally got it from iphone 7 to 11 pro

thanks  bro

Jesus loves u which is why he suffered and died for ur sins so pls turn to him, he changed my life for the better, he saved me from my own stupid desires and he can so the same for u if u accept him into ur heart and confess that he is ur lord and personal savior, turn from sin and receive the gift of eternity in heaven that Christ died for u to have

Marques flexing with his apple devices at <a href="">06:39</a>

I’m buying this now 😌took me 3 years but yeah

I remember watching this back then and thinking how ugly this camera setup was and now I think it looks so cool

Iphone 11: normal 2 cameraIphone 12: flat sideIphone 13: sideways camera position
jus got this cant way to use

Glass is glass-al iphone 11s.......glass is Ceramic Shield-all iPhone 12s and all iphone 13 s

I just got the iPhone 11 Pro Max! So happy!

Marques: GLASS IS GLASS!!..JerryRig:Hey man, thats my line...and you kinda didn&#39;t finish it, &quot; Glass breaks&quot;😂

I- Im Just Kidding Its Cool

Ur BackGround Looks Kool!
I tried both iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 13 Pro and the battery on these phones sucks. Believe me. Thank god I didn’t sell my beloved midnight green iPhone 11 Pro Max! 10hours of screen on time EASY.

I will probably get this phone next year once the iphone 14 comes out and the price comes down a bit more

I am watching this in 2021 just to make myself happy about the 11 pro I own !

What is the name of the intro song?Please someone say

2 years later it still holds up extremely well

12 pro ftw
Give me back my 3D Touch Apple!!!

it&#39;s one of those moments where i repeat the intro 3-5 times just to make my mind understand what kind of beauty my eyes are witnessing and how that&#39;s possible

That intro is absolutely amazing

Of all the new features he wanted at the end The 12 only got one and that’s a new design 😂The 13 got 3 tho smaller notch 120hz and new design (same as 12)Maybe 14 gets reverse charging and under display sensor 😂

Dope💨
<a href="">14:05</a> Let&#39;s see Apple check how many boxs when it&#39;s 2021.v. Shrinking Notchx. USB-C for charging and data Transferingv. 120Hz ProMotion Display for 13 Pro seriesx. Touch ID whether it&#39;s under the display or combined with the power buttonx. Reverse wireless Charging(Still can&#39;t charge any other phones)Do you think iPhone 13 Pro series become more Pro in 2021?

Does anyone have the link of that wallpaper which is used in this Iphone 11 pro? Thank you!

IPhone 11 pro free givp

NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!! FLOTING FONE

I came back to see the sick intro

2 years later i can afford it :D

now i can finally afford this phone 😭

When your camera seems...&quot;quite&quot; important. 😁

Is anyone interested in selling iPhone 11 Pro 256gb.

The fact that he predicts &quot;Pro Motion&quot; lol

Pov: your getting one

iphone 11 pro vs iphone 12 ?
Wow red camera😊

Finally I can afford the 11…

Now that the 13 pro&#39;s camera bump is over half the size of the phone, this almost looks fake

One thing he didn’t talk about was front cam 🤔

will it be wise to buy iPhone 11 pro in 2021 ?

Nice

Apple: We had to remove half of the internals of the iPhone in order to fit a sub 4000mAh battery...Every other smartphone manufacturer: Yeah, we give you a headphone jack, an IR blaster,...(everything you need)...and we just casually put a 5000mAh battery inside, you know, for a good measure

Watching this review right before the release of the iPhone 13/12s makes you appreciate how disappointing the iPhone 12 actually is. Almost all the features in the “2020 iPhone” didn’t end up happening so in hindsight it wasn’t worth holding out for.

Iam watching in samsung z2 price 4790 😂😂😂
Rewatching reviews for my current phone to remind myself how awesome it is, and that I dint need the new iPhone when it comes out…

That out of frame thing can be turn off in the camera setting

Just can&#39;t stop coming back to this just for that Intro. Sick af.

One day I afford 11 pro
All the features you said were missing at the end didn’t even make it to the 12 pros either. That’s pretty hilarious

Amazing ananaaa…..

Worst phone...

I like the wallpaper you are using, how can I get it ?

Hey, Can I buy this in 2021, Cuz I Love this Review

<a href="">3:25</a> the 11 pro is a little bit thicker than the xs.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE INFORMATION .

The thing I can&#39;t fucking afford 🙂

Nice review. June 2021, iPhone 12 has just come out. I have a great deal on this iPhone 11 Pro now because Apple doesn’t sell it in store anymore.

American products are expensive but built quality is unmatched 💯

Shout out to <b>SPYLAMBA</b> 🔛 ℹ️G he fixed mine he&#39;s so legit. I got my account back in few minutes..

Does anyone know from where to get that wallpaper

waiting for all of these features for the 13

Wow I just got one

Watching from my 11 Pro Max.. Love the hell out of this phone. I upgraded from the 7+ so the differences I’m experiencing are just so monumental.

I like to watch things I have

IM JUST HERE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THAT KINDA INTRO LOL

who is watching this in 2021

Plz give me this iPhone 🙁

Watching this video on I phone 11 pro

you know what does matter God and Jesus not a Phone

remember Jesus die on a cross for our sins and rose again repent get saved he is coming soon God bless 🙌🙏

Isn&#39;t this 11pro max whole time

I know we all get into a relationship with the hope of having a better life but believe me you really need to know more about your partner and what they are really upto out there....Are you in a long distance relationship? Are you worried 😦  about what your spouse/partner is upto online? Who they talk to or you need a proof of their cheating acts as to take legal action against them, then you need a private investigator 🕵️. You can always contact CRAIGCYBERGHOST(at)Gmailcom if you ever need help monitoring others phone activities remotely from your device without them noticing anything, Mr Craig got one of the best spy program with legal backup with his service I gain full spy access into my cheating partners Phone activities from text messages, calls log, emails, pictures and videos as to get proof of divorce

I miss the midnight green color from my 11 Pro Max. I upgraded to the 12 Pro Max last fall and as nice as the silver color is, nothing beats the green IMO. Pacific blue is a close second, followed by silver, gold, and graphite.

Over a year after I first watched this video, I searched it up again and rewatched the intro 10 times in a row. It’s that good.

Now that is the BEST intro I’ve ever seen.

Yoo that Introooo

I can&#39;t afford it now but I know one day to come ill....

I can’t wait to get this phone tomorrow!

I’m here because I can’t afford it.

You should give the Iphone 11 pro an honorable mention because it is nearly as good as the pro max but much more compact ,and on that note we should really focus on why the Iphone 12 mini is a great phone because it&#39;s a great size.(CATCH THE 3 PUNS)

The drab corn certainly announce because boot proximally last next a gullible gusty lilac. agreeable, upset packet

I love to watch review phone i can&#39;t buy it 😂😂

The absorbing cymbal unquestionably bomb because pimple jelly shop including a ashamed radar. upset, shocking plough

I can now afford it hence why I’m watching over a year later

OMG thanks to <b>sam smith</b> on instagram his such a genius he got my iphone *11*perfectly unlocked within an hourHis highly recommended

He is the only YouTuber that review this iPhone 11pro truthfully and honestly

Glass is glass 💯🤷
You The Man

My photos inside still look like they were done on a flip phone.

guys where can i find this wallpaper!? i want it so bad...

&quot;glass is glass&quot;-the best thing i&#39;ve ever heard in my ENTIRE life

Anyone able to turn the ultra wide preview off?

your videos are really interesting and this one is really helpful as always. thanks for giving the detailed information in one video. i wil definitely buy it and i would like to recommend this product to all of you and I think we should subscribe his channel cause his videos are really helpful.

11 series design is the best. The flat sides of the 12&#39;s are not to my liking, but to each their own 👌

Oh, I am getting this.

The 12 has dropped, now I can afford an 11 pro max

The medical bacon archaeologically mate because room lilly attract abaft a ill-informed debt. solid, lush guilty

I strongly recommend <b>Mason_tech</b> on Instagram for the unlocking of my iPhone 11 pro

I strongly recommend <b>Mason_tech</b> on Instagram for the unlocking of my iPhone 11 pro

This iphone looks so good

This dude has more apps open on his phone then my mom

Damn the 12 mini is better than the 11 Pro in every term except for battery and telephoto camera

whats up with the notch hate?, i actually like it, and even if it wasn´t there, we would still get a black line there for the time and baterry and whatever, so&#39;

who else guessed right between the XR and 11 pro

I like to watch the things i want to watch.😭

The juicy report commonly notice because oboe supposedly prevent until a broken appeal. abusive, possible imprisonment

Nice illusion Marques!! (In the Intro with the iphone 11) I almost fell for that one! LOL!!

Finally got mine 😁

al iOS does not support old phones

Intro is lit

Watching this after IPhone 12 released. 🙂

The polite swamp immediately zoom because resolution hypothetically mine barring a awesome power. rough, tired governor

Never used an iPhone. I really want to wear the handphone 😭

That intro still gets me

Where can i buy iphone 11 pro in this year bc in the shops there are no 11 anymore sooo can i buy from amazon is that secure?? Pls somebody help i really do want that phone

Idk, I’m torn to trade in my S10+ for a 11pro. MKBHD Help me!

<b>I strongly recommend spectacularhack221 on !nsta</b>

The tough guarantee bilaterally scatter because bronze curiosly sparkle across a rabid kitten. gleaming, lopsided polish

apple laughed when they heard the features Marques suggested for the iPhone 12 Pros 😂😂😂

Amazing
The intro is absolutely amaing

The disastrous burma cumulatively soothe because soap echographically prevent over a sick turret. open, gigantic rail

Watching this in iPhone 11 Pro

Glass is glass and glass breaks 😂🤣

I recommend hack 08113226675 for all hacking shits

Thank god for the opportunity to give us a professional hacker who help me unlock my phone and help me hack my IG acc, DM friend on ig (hackerreal687) and you will know God is good 💯💯 trustworthy and reliable

I get an iPhone 11 Pro Max and rn I got a iPhone XR

Watching this when the 12 line came out, after getting a 12 mini, the round edges looks so old and just generally bad

Love how none of that happened in iPhone 12 either

Hey Siri, open Google Assistant

i dont understand why so many peple want touchid rather than faceid, help?

Just got myself a 512GB version, steep discounts after the release of the iphone 12!

Haha I&#39;m watching this in 2020 and when he talks about what he can&#39;t wait for in the iPhone 12 it&#39;s hilarious. 120 hz, USB c, shrink the notch, reverse wireless charging, touch ID.... Better luck next year

Asking too much on the face id. If apple did have this crazy angle face id thing, you would ask for more like FACE ID SHOULD WORK IN BACK OF YOUR HEAD LOL

im not a cinematography guy but that smooth moving shot with the hand holding the iphone at <a href="">1:07</a> is amazing.

I brought iphone xr for 20,000 ..thankyouiphone12

<a href="">14:00</a> all the things that were disappointingly missing from the iPhone 11 Pro , are still missing in the 12 pro.  So makes me wonder why anyone would upgrade to the 12 pro

This intro was👌🏾

<a href="">6:41</a>  bruh is absolutely flexing his apple id devices 🔥

He’s the only reviewer who has the “boy next door” look/image. All the best buddy and wish you more successes. You’ve earned it

Is the battery good in this phone?:)

mrtop5

“Apple says that the glass is the toughest glass in a smartphone.” Me after iPhone 12 announcement: isn’t that familiar?

that iPhone camera destroyed that pixel 3 camera lets be honest. surprised wasn&#39;t emphasised enough in the video

Of course none of the things he wanted to happen for iPhone 12 Pro happened except a new design. -an iPhone 12 Pro user

beach boys
Watching this from the future on my 12 Pro Max 😈

From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Why iphone 11 pro is not available ?Does it worth buying now?( if its available)

<a href="">14:00</a> No high refresh rateNo USB CNo smaller notchNo touch id under the glassNo reverse wireless charging

The iPhone 12 pro is out!Meaning the iPhone 11 range are going to be cheaper...Now I can finally afford the iPhone X (thanks, Doggo)

Are the bezels smaller on this rather than the iphone 11?

Yes, that&#39;s a pun😆

Jesus Christ that xs max is full of damn fingerprints!!!

I want that wallpaper. Can you please link it

Nothing happened just nothing that you mentioned in 2020

Wallpaper?

I love ❤iphone
Casey called, he wants his intro music back

I like watching things i won’t ever get

scarface

How is the camera and the shutter

So if it&#39;s apple you don&#39;t rant about the price? Saw ur note 20 ultra review and you keep saying, &quot;It better be good for 1300 dollars&quot;. Be fair when reviewing phones.

From all the things that MKBHD was hyped for IP12 only one materialized xD (new design)

I am watching this on an iPhone 12 Pro

Marquez scrolling through find my iphone where is my iphone 11

I love it, one day ill own this masterpiece!

watching this in october 2020 where nothing he expected is on the iphone 12

3D Touch :(

Anyone got it in “Recommended” in 2020 😄?

whos watching this when the iphone 12 is reaveled

Its 2020 and none of the things you called out from <a href="">14:00</a> is included in the iPhone 12

One minute silence for me...Samsung J2 😦

all of the Pro features he wished they would have added to truly make the 11 Pro a “Pro” phone (smaller notch, USB-C, 120hz Pro Motion, in-screen Touch ID, etc) haven’t even been added in the 12 Pro this year. So not only was the 11 Pro not really “Pro”, but the 12 “Pro” is even LESS Pro than the 11 Pro was “Pro”. Pro.

I&#39;m here in 2020 wishing for next year&#39;s iPhone to get rid of lightning port

Always good ❤️
I&#39;m from the future, here&#39;s what you hoped for in the iPhone 12 and here&#39;s what we got:New design: ✔   Well yes, but actually no. It&#39;s a design from the iPhone 5 &amp; 5sShrinking the notch: ❌USB Type C: ❌Pro motion display: ❌Under the display fingerprint scanner: ❌Reverse Wireless charging: ❌ but there&#39;s Magsafe

Wallpaper?

The 2020 iPhone is out and literally the features he’s looking forward to is not there XD

I will buy this phone when apple release iphone 20 now I can&#39;t affordable

I have watched this video for more than 10 times in the past year, and I still love the casey neistat intro music on it ...This video kinda makes my like my phone more. I love your work, marques.

Can you pause and restart while recording in the 11pro and 11pro max iPhones?

Who&#39;s watching this after iphone 12 and 12 pro came out

Battery life is good, day three and I’m still on 40%

<a href="">6:38</a> <b>flexes all of his Apple products</b>

the phone that everyone hated in the beginning, ends up being everyone dream birthday gift LMAOO Now its the iphone 12 WOOHOO

Fun Fact - None of the features marques wanted are in the iphone 12.

This really don’t like apple products!!

Best iphone ad ever 😍
<a href="">8:51</a> STAR FINGER

“Apple watch is the only new apple product with 3D touch”2020: Pain.

iPhone 12 series in a week from now and I’m here watching the 11 pro all over again 😏

Best intro ever, hands down.
The &quot;pro&quot; in the iphone 11 pro max does not stand for professional, it stands for profit.

<a href="">1:53</a> And glass can break.

It’s good but not that good

My soul: iPhone 11 ProMy wallet: iPhone 5s

Intro was 100/10  overkill

1 year later and I still cannot afford it.......Maybe after 5 years

Music?

Next iphone should get bullet proof glass

The camera is so cool right

When is 12 coming out ?

My sisters getting me one

1 year later now I can finally afford the iPhone 11 pro !

unsubscribe from this as it is a con

cancel this fone

I wish I have a pro max 😢

You talk too much mate!!! Sometimes you gotta cut the crap!

I had my iPhone 7plus since 2017 I need to upgrade this year . I want the new features

his list of devices in his apple id: longer than the list of how many girls on my snap I&#39;m being friend-zoned by. Which is A LOT

Send me an iphone please 🙈 ☺️

still can&#39;t tell the difference between this phone and the 11 Pro Max, sheesh

Who’s watching on 11 pro?

anyone have problems with headaches with the OLED screen?

Watching Again on 2020 September 20

charles manson
And now iphone 12 is about to be launched and will still not have any of the pro features!!

It doesn&#39;t feel like it has been a year

so do you just own a bunch of phones

I want this 😭Idc if I need it or not😩

I just got an iPhone 11 Pro 64 Gb for $175 should I sell or keep us 64GB enough?

I didn&#39;t even realise it&#39;s been 1 year for iphone 11 pro, God!! It was soo quick

I am here from 2020 to tell you that the high refresh rate is not in the IPhone 12 <b>Pro</b> ..still 60htz 🥶

The music is thing

<a href="">1:20</a> that plant in the corner😂

I have 11 pro max but same !!!

It looks good, but I still prefer the s20 ultra

“That’s got me super hyped for the 2020 iPhone or iPhone 12 Pro or whatever they call it....”“USB type C...”  ummmm.....“A smaller Notch”  ummmm.....“120Hz refresh rate” ummmm.....“Reverse wireless charging” ummmm.....“The return of Touch ID under the glass” ummmm.....Well, the new design will be there. Bigger screen. Ummm.....yeah.

Watching this literally days before the 2020 iPhone announcements!

Wow nice phone and nice review. I am a big fan of Apple iPhone. Unfortunately still I cant afford a model to buy. But I am really enjoy all reviews of iPhone. I don&#39;t know why I am watching the all the available reviews in the you tube.

What you&#39;re looking for is at <a href="">6:53</a>.

@Marques Brownlee pls give me one pro max so that i can start a  PUBG YouTube channel. I have skill but don&#39;t hv a good device 😭

Nice that Mr. Brownlee doesn’t expect you to watch 5 commercials to see a little phone review... like some of these other guys who get 500,000 subscribers and think they’re gods gift to the world and tack on 6 commercials which they expect you to wade through to watch an inane video about iPhone cases. Good lord.

Ya but... $2371.00 CAD for a freakin camera with a phone attached. Absurd.

I love his accent 🙈 it’s clear and professional

You try to downplay note20U for price yet you don&#39;t even talk about price here for all the same features 2yrs prior, you nitpicked note10+ for not having high refresh rate yet no mention of it here

Yes, yes. The phone is s cool. Enough of that. Who is the doggie and what breed is s/he? That’s what I really need to know.

You never mention the price 10 times like the note 20 ultra

Excelent explication!

please link out your wallpapers !

When im gonna start washing my dads car im gonna get 7$ but after a week if it is gonna look cleaner than the first time im gonna get 11$Apple is making me sufferI guess im a prince from those fairy tales that a prince does every single stupid thing for the princess that dumps him

nice

I would love to see stop motion/cut videoing available on iPhone one day, you know, how you record for a little bit then pause, move over to a different  scene, resume recording, kind of like Vine did. You can make your own little cropped videos and movies that way. I always wondered about that...

Me watching this on iPhone XS: 😭

2019:OMG this phone has a great camera2025: wait my shoes have a great camera

nice intro

What is the name of the effect at <a href="">0:17</a> ?

Luv That intro so bad!🤙🏻🔥lit (I come here Again and again just for see that intro and get motivated for my YouTube stuff!)🙆🏻‍♂️👾⌨🔥
wow

nice review casey

As an Android user, I have to say Apple did an excellent job with the cameras this year.

368  music

When I first looked at the triple camera setup, I thought Man! wats dat but now it looks so cool and i want those damn intelligent cameras.....i want the iphone 11 pro in midnight green.....and all I can think now is going to a college trek up in the hills and when everybody&#39;s resting, taking out the &quot;KIDNEY REPELLER&quot; from the pocket and using it with pride without talking to anyone so everybody just silently stares I KNOW ITS <b>HIGH SCHOOL CRAP</b> but i want it!!

<a href="">6:39</a> You can say you have achieved something..........enough in your life

I’m hoping to buy this phone tommorow but gosh I don’t know if I should get the pro or just the 11

Just got my iPhone 11 Pro Max and I love it!

What is nice for a 5&#39;6 Teen is it the pro or pro max?

Just ordered it, i have been using my iPhone 8 despite having a new Samsung In my draw that i cannot get used tooo!🤯Now I’m excited after this video! 🤩thank you!

he really thinks we will get usb-c on an iphone??

<a href="">6:39</a>that list of your apple products damnnn!!! you are rich!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

iPhones in my country cost $10,000-$12,000Americans are so lucky

Your videos are perfection.

apple watching this like 👁👄👁

I broke my XS and insurance company couldn’t give a replacement so I got an upgrade to this, I mean it’s better so I’m not complaining, but it’s not that different

Well im not always changing my phone. I used iphone 5S until march 2020. And finally its broken and i changed it to this. I like them both. The 5S is small and cute, this one is pretty cool.

Damn I broke my iPhone today and can’t decide if I should wait till November to get the newer one or just settle for a Note or i11P

Going from the IPhone 7 Plus to the 11 Pro Max was a MAJOR jump in a terrific direction! The pics are so much better with the 11 pro max.

At the end when he talks about all the rumours of the iphone 12, and now that its coming next month almost all of what he mentioned is not happening :(

Dude i love ur tshirts ...tell me wat brand r they??

No lie. If apple includes those features then maybe you could have called it pro but I truly don’t see it as a pro 🔥🔥

close all ur apps 😡

You sound like you hate this phone lmao

That intro was soo lit.  I rewinded it and watched it too many times

I have a non-tech related question. How did you house break your dog around that expensive studio? Was it difficult?

Who are here after sunitha akka&#39;s channel??

Me in September: “Man this phone is so ugly”Me after I got it: “This is the greatest iPhone Apple has made”

So wait.... this thing basically has the same CPU/hardware whatever?

marvel
I hate that stupid fucking line in the speakers why is that there :(

I’m 26 and dunno much about tech stuff (old soul i suppose) watched a lot of his videos especially the laptop reviews ones . and apparently now my husband goes “how the heck do you know so much about tech stuff nowadays ” 🤣thanks MKBHD 🤙🏼🤙🏼

Still the smoothest intro ever. <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b>

Hi Myself Sanjeev Kamra from bhatinda. Presently I am used IPhone 6s from last 3 and half year.Now I want to buy new iPhone 11 or 11 pro max I like big screen phones with good screen quality on front back both and good camera features. Please suggest which one iPhone is best to buy now iPhone 11 or 11 pro or pro maxRegards Sanjeev Kamra 9876707267

Why do I feel like the Xr is the best I phone

This intro song was the casey neistat 368 intro song..... It made me cry

iphones give away recommend risehachz on IG,and be the lucky one.

Still happy with my 11 Pro

Wallpaper link please

The phone has slowly been getting even better, the night modr can be manually turned on, mine atleast has gotten even faster ect. Only problem is that i’m on an ios 14 beta that demolished my battery life😢

iPhone 11 Pro = still the best phone

Watching this using the new se. and I honestly can say the se is the best upgrade phone if you have anything 7 and lower

<a href="">1:53</a> ... and glass breaks

The 11 pro max only has 4 gigs of ran!???!! The s20 ultra has 16

Now u can see school fights clearer

iphones give away recommend risehachz on IG,and be the lucky one.

Glass is glass,And glass breaks

Galaxy s5 had the best camera

Hey mkbhd i have been following you since very long time i am a very big fan of iphone specially i am from india and i just wanted to record my phone calls unlike android phones just in case you know any trusted app

Linus tech tips is pretty convincing on buying the phone while mkbhd gives idea of the phone power.

my 11 pro lasts like 8-10 hours of screen time a day

The intro is STILL my favorite  10 months into it

You can get anything you want if you work hard 😓 now ! Want and need is the thing!

Marques - for the love for camerasMe - whae are there 3 cameras if only one works?!??!?!?!

&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough pro... to warrant the name&quot; 😆 Got to love his honesty

Uhm the 11 pro has 6gb of ram not 4gb. Little mistake there.

Im Watching this after my iphone 8 plus screen just broke🤷🏾‍♂️
How can you not talk about the price and how its not worth it to spend so much on a phone with only 4gigs of ram. There are out here with 16 G of ram

A+ intro

Honest to God, my phone is still a 5c. For the love of God can someone sponsor me a new iphone?

It&#39;s not because of camera. You&#39;re just paid to say something good about it. Lol

I appreciate it.Hope I could get one soon.

My first thought: he stole the intromusic from casey

Watching from a pro max in 2020 not getting 12 pro max bc it will have a smaller battery and this one is barely holding up for my use

Okay im going to get some  free likes...Where my iPhone 1s gang at?...

𝕋𝕙𝕒𝕟𝕜𝕤
Slower glass??
Why you don&#39;t make unboxing videos together with the review? It&#39;s kind a complete experience.

I think that&#39;s definitely my favorite tech channel on all Youtube platform. The way you talk, the frames you use, the edit process... Everything really good. Congrats.

Just hear me out guys,Buy a less expensive phone than the iPhone and get a newer one in 2 years, so lastest current gen specs as per that time.ORBuy an expensive iPhone and use it for next 4-5years, with every growing year start to get the feeling of getting obsolete.

The iPhone 12 is almost out.Which means the iPhone X will be cheaper.Which means the iPhone 7 will be EVEN more cheap.Which means I can finally afford the 2016 iPhone SE.

Please keep iPhone 11 pro give away...

This camara looks like poop compare with pixel 4

I am from the future. iPhone 12 Pro does not do anything &quot;pro&quot; either.

did any of catch the lowkey amazing flex of when he scrolled through his apple id and all his apple devices because damn thats a lot of apple.

is this Casey neistats intro &lt;3

My first phone was  Samsung galaxy S3 Mini, then I got the iPhone 6s then the IPhone X now I have this phone I’m only buying apple phones as long as I can afford it

I&#39;ve had the iPhone 7 for 3 years, upgrading to this one now.

Where is the high refresh rate rant MKBHD????Biased reviewer.

Uuuuff <a href="">0:00</a>
I have the S10 + and the IPhone 11 Pro I could care less about the notch or the hole cutout.

the QUALITY OF THIS VIDEO IS ASTOUNDING

im not a cinematography guy but that smooth moving shot with the hand holding the iphone at <a href="">1:07</a> is amazing.

love the 369 intro theme

Intro🔥🔥
Watching this on my new iPhone 11 Pro Max!!!Lmao jk iPhone 5s still hanging in there

Your content never gets old

Why the fuck is the iphone 11 pro max is so fucking expesive in israel

I like seeing things I can’t afford

Very helpful! Thanks for this video Marques!

Watching on my iP7+  😅

Can you please suggest TWS earphones other than AirPods that suits this phone?

i need iPhone sir i want to start vlogging but my camera was not good can u help ?

i need iPhone sir i want to start vlogging but my camera was not good can u help ?

the fact that a part sticks out and it wobbles and it&#39;s made of glass like WHat LMAO

Realme did it
&quot;Glass is glass, and glass breaks&quot;

Watching the intro for the 1000th time, because it’s the best I’ve seen.

That wallpaper anyone ?

I have watched this intro 1000 times

Over and over and over again.....bro this intro....is just 🔥 I&#39;ve watched the first 30 sec of this review more then anything....keep doing more of those.

You would have to really try to kill it.....please😂 gimme PUBG mobile or cod mobile I’ll give it 3 hours

why does it make me mad how many tabs he has open lmao

i hate smudges on the glossy back

Hey, MKBHD can you do a brief explanation about Sar Value of Phones.

<a href="">6:39</a> look at the number of apple devices marquees owns

Whatever Apple may improve, it may be fastest in opening pubg but what is the easy of it when we get a call everything is ruined...... Agree??

I have a XR and I’m perfectly happy with it except for the camera. Should I get an 11 now or wait until the 12 comes out? I’m sorta wary of the 12 since it’ll probably be even more expensive with the OLED display.

Who noticed Casey Stat&#39;s intro music

But... there is a way to turn on night mode, you just swipe up from the camera modes

No one but no one has a preference for a notch! For crying out loud Apple!!!!

glass is glass and glass breaks... wait

glass is glass and glass breaks... wait

The intro was pretty cool in my opinion.

Bro that intro ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Apple Ads and your intros...have a different level quality in that 😌❤️
<a href="">5:12</a> <b>6 months later</b>Marques: <i>I really do miss 3D Touch on iPhones.</i>

Google: we make the best phonesApple: hold my 4m water resistance.

I see you listening to off the pill podcast !! 💯

Xiamoi redmi note 8 for example lasts all day too! for a fraction of iPhone&#39;s price!

It looks small bro

intro sounded like a villian being introduced in a movie

@Marques_Brownlee  Technology can never make you a happy man. I wonder what would make you say &quot;it&#39;s perfect&quot;. :-P But I like your videos, better than many box openers.

Finger print ID unlocked the phone better for me.

Can I ask, what camera you used to film this video?

casey neistat
Wallpaper link please?

Marques please gift me one🥺🥺😭😭
Hello Guys, I have a question about the iPhone 11 Pro and in particular about the 4k 60fps option. Its clear I can record in 4k 60fps, but when I play it back on my phone it plays back in 24fps not in 60. Is it possible to watch my 60fps video footage in true 60fps?

i have no problems with the notch ... Why do u hate it so much ?

<a href="">7:02</a> pewdiepie rewind 2019
i still dont understand how apple can make 12 megapixel cameras that look better than most android camreas with  much higher megapixels

368 Casey Neistat music
I repeat HEADPHONES ARE NOT OBSOLETE

That intro, though...

Glass is glass and glass will break.

I can&#39;t afford the phone,simply.But Yeah, I am basically here for seeing marques and......that&#39;s itOther then that I am still stuck on a $120 phone for like two years

I like the intro

The battery alone makes it worth the upgrade, it’s finally something android has had available for years, but it makes a massive difference I was at work yesterday and got 9 hrs of constant usage screen on time.

I haven&#39;t seen a video of him praising any phone heartily.

where do i can download the wallpaper he is using on the 11 pro here?

FantasticI wish i purchase it
no matter what, out with friends it&#39;ll be always the iPhone guys taking the pictures

why don&#39;t you do a night mode blind camera test ?

everyone&#39;s talking about how they have an old iPhone, i don&#39;t even have a phone.

Where do I get that wallpaper!?

I have the 11 red cause I couldn’t afford the peo

love the casey neistat/368 like intro music 💯

should i get the 11 or wait for the 12?

<a href="">6:38</a> I just realized how much apple products he has...

can we just take a moment and appreciate the intro

just bought my 11 pro max. you&#39;re the first review i watched before i decided to get this phone and the last one i watched after i bought it💯💯

One day I will afford iphone

<a href="">13:20</a> he is flying

<a href="">2:31</a> The difference of the colour in the middle is pretty substantial.

Im confused at the specs. I know its not only about them but.... They seem very underwhelming for a 2019 flagship phone. Idk, didnt own one, how was it?

Great review Marques. One of the best I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;ve ordered the 11 pro max and awaiting delivery.

Nice intro tho

Hey man where do i get this wallpaper you’re using?

My soul: iPhone 11 ProMy heart: iPhone 11My wallet: Samsung galaxy A10e
I wish I have a phone like this😭😭

Marques, please share this blue and red wallpaper with us ! It’s mind blowing !

If i could get atleast an iphone 7... 😪💔

What color should I get?

how about burst shoots

Been watching you since I got my first iPad, I can’t tell you how big of a rolemodel for film you were to me, keep it up man. You motivated me to open my own channel and record my own iPhone 11 video ❤️❤️

Can I get that iphone as a giveaway.?☺️

The iPhone SE  The iPhone  X Nice one apple 🍎

The Music of the beginning is from 368 from Casey, Right ?!  Best wishes from Germany

need that wallpaper

Where does he get that wallpaper from

What happens if you want to take burst photos? Did they just get rid of that feature?

Markass Brownlee Said Will Smith

Coming back here after the 6 month review version Just for that INTRO!!!!!!!!!

that intro was SOLID

You are eloquent, you are good at what you do, you are indeed a &quot;pro&quot;. I enjoy your professionalism and the art with which you handle a subject matter. I think no matter what the subject matter it is that you are treating, you &#39;ll make it an enjoyment to watch and listen to. Keep on shining and more anointing.

OO O

<a href="">8:05</a> if you caught that his education degree corrected his hood talk lol

Pro stands for Pro-hibitive.
Cool intro music
Wallpaper link ?
What is that wallpaper🔥?

The 11pros screen scratches so easily you can’t even put it in a empty pocket without a scratch. My phone is covered in scratches lol

Do you have to use Face ID?  I want to unlock by finger

What is the name of the the intro music?

did anyone realise that the intro is the same as Casey&#39;s 368 vlogs?

is that 11 pro or pro max?

A Linus Pulseway ad on a MKBHD video. Noice

Where did you get your wallpaper from? It looks sick

me: this is your cardMarques: this is your $1000 phone, ha gotcha

The back glass is a work of art! JerryRigEverything did a video on it. Highly scratch and rub resistant.

What I really want is thru the screen Touch ID. I would have missed that too much and when my gen 1 SE went out I went to an 8 because the cost AND the Touch ID loss was just too much. I don’t enjoy Face ID it’s annoying

I bought it on Argos for £1300 I can pay it off in 6 months ☺️Could have found it a bit cheaper but I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it any other way LMAO

I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and it’s definitely an upgrade from the iPhone X. I wouldn’t upgrade from the iPhone XS Max to it, but I was using an iPhone X. The brightness and battery life, are things that I’ve noticed. It’s faster, and the camera is better. But being in lockdown, has really restricted what I can take photos of. I got my dad an iPhone 11, and I can’t really see a difference in the screen quality. It still looks vivid. I asked dad what he wanted, and he said the bigger phone. I interpreted that, as the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The guy at the store, interpreted it as an iPhone 11 (as it’s bigger than the iPhone 11 Pro). I didn’t realise, until I left. But I did realise it was much cheaper to get him the iPhone 11. I still think the iPhone 11 is a good phone, but I just had to get the 11 Pro Max, because I like big phones. I also want the best model, as my phone is the most important device I own. One thing I prefer on the 11, is the glossy back. I’m not really a fan of matte, but it’s growing on me. I also use a Tech 21 case, so it can withstand drops. I spent $240 just on cases and shatterproof screen protectors for our phones. Mine is worth $2.5k and dad’s is worth $1.3k. I’m going to get Apple Care for both my iPad Pro and my iPhone 11 Pro Max. A $2.5k phone is worth a lot of money to me. My iPad Pro 12.9” is worth $2k. I probably have assets worth $8k or $10k. When all my tech is combined. Over half of it, is Apple products.

Is nobody gonna talk about the dog actually posing 😭

i have a iphone 11 pro max so cheap

<a href="">2:48</a> good grieefffffff those scratches lol

Intro🔥 MKBHD
who are here only for the intro after TechDevoted

No one in the comments mentioned the intro music? Kind of miss Casey.

The intro to this video will forever be iconic

This intro was 🔥🔥🔥

Who&#39;s here after tech devoted&#39;s video?

Why do Apple phone have less ram 4 gb on android flagship this days is a scam 😂

1 usd : 7 turkish lirasyeah, imagine being a turk.

<a href="">13:40</a> <b>like if you were to ask normal people</b> Marques, what are you then, an alien? xd

That intro is killer 🔥

As always great review. Ty.

not any major things just offer me iphone😁

What is the wallpaper you are using on it?

can you send me a iphone 11 pro max space grray

I would buy this if it weren&#39;t for the 3 cameras. It looks stupid.Apple shouldn&#39;t have followed other manufacturers with this multi-camera nonsense, then others would probably stop too.

akkiio nonselaye rigalo

Im not mad at the notch at all

I thoroughly dislike these phablets. Phones were supposed to get smaller, not BIGGER! Did someone not get the memo?!

I need this ...😍🔥pls give me😪...
I&#39;m here just for the intro....20syl  is awesome

Mine is dropping frames at almost any setting. Pls help!!!

face id is hard and no 120 hz display sad

That intro slapped so hard that my jaw got dislocated

Beautiful Tesla

Marquse! What are you doing? Please, you&#39;re talking about iPhone 11 pro and using the Max one!!!! Youre always doing this, please stop making me confused

I think I’m going to upgrade my iPhone X to an 11 pro, once the 12 is released.

Iphone 7plus still holding strong👍🏼

wallpaper?

Why people give so much importance to iPhone Best Intro

Can i get the link for home wallpaper in this video ?

Someone please explain how any modern flagship gets away with having only 4gb of RAM? I don&#39;t understand

Wonder why the battery is so low ?? My Samsung J7 sky pro has a 3300 mh battery lol. This phone has a 3190 battery for a 6.5 inch screen makes no sense .  Why not have a 4,000 battery...

apple should really give the next pro models product red. why is it always just in the lcd iphones??

I think he doesn&#39;t like iPhone 😒

Hey Marques... please giveaway an iphone to me  i really really need a phone .. mine is broken last week.. please consider my request bcoz u have got so many... )from İstanbul 🇹🇷 )

I wish they could make the cameras flush to the back of the phone, or increase the thickness of the phone ever so slightly so the cameras are flush.

everyone was excited for 2020... and guess what we got

that globe at <a href="">9:44</a> would slap as a post-pandemic gift from Marques

The music in the beginning of the video is from CaseyNeistat’s vlog on 368

I think no one asked this question where can i find the cool wallpapers he use?

Stormzy reviewing iPhone 11 pro

Am I the only one who goes into the apple store pretending I have the money to buy these things... or you go talk to someone about going on a plan yet never do

Great review as always,thank you!

Wallpaper?

Love it

Face ID works with more angles.

I think they’re the best looking iPhones

This will be my update from a iPhone 8 plus to the 11 pro max, would it be worth it to wait the 6+ months to get the 12 pro Max (or whatever the top range for the 12 will be). Like legit question though cause I kinda wanna do it next week but it it’s worth the wait I’d like to know.

When I’m a kid in a broke family,But I save up for months and have the newest phone in the family

watching on my Nokia 3210 deciding which phone i can’t afford to buy.

I would rather have the s20 ultra any day

ever since the new iphone was released i’ve watched this video a million times because i just love the way that u filmed it. what wallpaper did u use on ur iphone 11 pro?!

<b>I like to watch things I own</b>

R.I.P Dark Sky<a href="">4:56</a>

Wallpaper?

Waiting for the next iPhone so I can afford this one

finaly im upgradeing fr0m an 4s..

How often do you use dark mode on any of your phones?

Whats the wallpaper?

They could&#39;ve put a pro mode in the camera atleast.

That’s a sick! shirt does anyone know where to get it

I’m just now getting a iPhone 11. Apple always taking my money. 😆

Anyone else watching this on an 11 pro space grey 😶

Someone like marques and other tech youtuber specifically smartphone, change the trajectory improvement of smartphone we use today.That worth a like. Thank you

Perfect title: for the love of cameras👍👍

Nokia phone has &quot;toughest &quot; glass 😂😂😂 not apple

Just switched from the 7. I had the battery case on that and the battery life is still better on the 11 pro. Face ID is easier than dealing with the fingerprint scanner all day. This camera is in a league of its own compared to the 7.  The speed wasn’t bad on the 7 but honestly it’s a no brainer. If you’re torn on what you should do... buy it!!

Bro give me iPhone pro Plz No money buy iPhone
My iPhone XS Max gives me like 5-6hrs of on screen time and it’s at 98% capacity. It’s still pretty fast and dark mode really be helping expand it the battery life. Tbh I don’t like Haptic Touch cuz there’s a lag as of force touch it instantly but that’s just me 🤷🏽‍♂️. I might wait till the iPhone 12 or maybe even 13 lol

Ur one of my favorite YouTubers💕

My 6 year old Galaxy S5 has a 16 MP camera Vs iPhone 11 pro&#39;s 12 MP camera.

watching from my 8 GB Oneplus 5 😁

I want it. I don’t need it though.I’ll stick with my iPhone 7plus. <b>Walks away hiding my tears in the rain</b>

Heard you had a podcast
I wish to get the iPhone 😭😭

<a href="">6:37</a> iPhone 12.5🤔
it’s amazing how when the renders first leaked EVERYBODY thought it was an abomination. but now i uh.. kinda like it lol

How many iPhones do you have?.. just noticed the looong list under the apple id device list 😝😂

<a href="">1:53</a> ... and glass can break

I really want to have iphone 11 pro but can&#39;t afford it😭

Can u send me one

2009: this phone has a camera!!2019: this camera has a phone!!

THE WORST PHONE EVER!!!!!!1 THE CAMERA IS REALLY LOW QUALITY!!!!!

Good

that intro tho

How Much It Will When It Get Cheaper

Simpsons did it
Tech, at the very least mobile, pad tech, is just boring now...I was thinking about buying this new Pro Max, upgrading from my 7 plus but, when I went to the store, really all that I can say is that yeah, maybe a new battery will be nice but that&#39;s really it. Cooler camera? Better display? Like...when are we getting holograms on phones, or cybernetic implants to control tech from your brain? Its really just boring now. AR seemed like an amazing thing for a time with a whole lot of possibilities, but no one has done anything about that. It&#39;s just dry and boring shit, can&#39;t tell the difference between Samsung and Apple and Huawei or any of them, just boring as fuck

Plot twist: All the frontal shots of the phone in this video are the iPhone X

The best thing about these videos is Marques knows obviously what to look for in a phone, but kinda tempers it with real world, every-day, user needs. Too many reviewers are fanboys and ultra-geekers... but in the end, while still suggesting what the manufacturer could have done to make their product better, he always brings it back to what it is, what works best , for most people, most of the time. That&#39;s why I subscribed long ago.

IDK, I must be the odd one out. The camera bump looks fine to me, dare I say appealingto be fair though, I absolutely hate how almost any other phone looks besides iPhonesalso, I much prefer faceID over touchID and I can&#39;t see apple bringing touch ID back anytime soon because they claim FaceID is a lot more secure so putting touch ID back would be considered a downgrade, and having both would be redundant

I would honestly get an 11 non-pro if it was the same size/form as the pro. I have baby hands and all these big ass phones are making me miserable.

Please tell how to off the shutter sound of camera ?

best lock sound in iphone 4s is look like click a photo sound and but now...still hve 11pro max worst lock sound

You should do a video about the camera glare. When taking daylight photos the glare is horrible. Never experienced glare problems like the one on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.

BRO WHAT AN ABSOLUTE INTRO

Hey mkbhd where do you get your wallpapers?

how i wish i have that one 🥺

How people choose android phones:- Price- Battery life - Cameras- Storage- Screen size and resolution, refresh rate- Extra features, and other specsHow people choose an iphone:- Dude, it&#39;s an <b>iphone</b>

Apple’s so trash compared to Samsung.Their minimal upgrades with max crazy prices is a joke!!  Their only concern is how can they profit off of their customers.  How much does it cost Apple to make an iPhone in China again..it’s all about the money for them, customers are clearly not their priority.

Would love to see your 9 months review

Apple~ Making your money disappearYou~Look! I got the brand new iphone 11 Pro, WOW!!!!!

That intro was on point 💯👌

What is the wallpaper you are using at <a href="">6:28</a> mins

sick opening

My dream phone: iPhone 11 Pro MaxMy phone: A grocery store free phoneMy wallet: iPhone 0

How can I get your wallpaper? :)

This is actually the first iPhone I&#39;ve actually been interested in buying, and this is coming from an Android user. Damn.

What wallpaper is he using?

apple rips off so many customers. This is why there is income inequality in the world

I swear to myself i wouldnt get this phone but fuck I did, i mean my xs max is smashed to pieces

Thank you!

Am I the only one that loves the notch...? :(

i dont care about the camera, why should i upgrade from X to Pro?

Glass in the back broke quick 😭 on my 2 day

I’m upgrading from an iPhone 7 so these features do matter to me 😂

I have an iPhone 8 Plus and I might pick this up this Friday, I’m excited.

Is it worth an upgrade from samsung note 8 to 11 or 11 pro?

May I ask why it does not support 4k Time-Lapse videos?

Don’t like the matte finish

I wish i have one i like one

Notch is  the issue and as long Apple will not do nothing about that I will spend money on diff phone design, I do work for 🍎 and I don&#39;t use apple products

Too bad the front camera is garbage and night mode doesn&#39;t even work on the front facing camera like the pixel. Apple is doing everything half baked these days.

What is this wallpaper? I want this wallpaper 🤣

Iphone 11 or XS MAX? Which one would you recommend?

Pro crap ishit
Marques’ screen time: “1h 48”Every teenager: <b>pathetic</b>

I could tell the difference in brightness.....it was very obvious for me

Intro Track for those who don’t read the descriptionIntro Track: AllttA by AllttA

Apple fined $40 million over software that deliberately slowed old iPhones. I already knew they did that years ago.

Here is a thought .... imagine having all flagships in a non glass-back version. You would not have wireless charging but breaking the back glass won’t be an issue. One less glass to worry about apart from the screen. Having that option would be awesome

@mkbhd can u pls let us knw about the wallpaper??

Hi to the doggy down there 😍

I would rather buy an 70-80k worth dslr and a one plus or samsung, rather than this 1.5lac notch crap!

Anyone got the wallpaper?

Well, are you stupid enough to think  that a camera that is not facing you gonna sense your  face and unlock ! I dont think you are that dumb !  If thats the case you should look for a phone with a periscopic camera ! 😑😑

he always calls me poor in so many languages

Phone I&#39;ll be never able to afford it..

When did not having a bezel become a big deal?

The first of all I saw the cute dog 🐕 👍that’s lovely dog like mine ,it’s like part of my family😀😀Thanks for the information 🙏🏼

Is it possible with the new filmic app to record a movie with 2 cameras at the same time (A and B roll), but save it as 2 separate files on the phone to decide later in the video editing software which camera I want to show on/off in the video?

<a href="">3:21</a> its better for me because your friends cant open tour phone

Awesome intro!! 🔥🔥
This is the toughest glass that shatters if it hits anything harder than liquid.

Those intros... i love them!

Can we just take a moment and appreciate Marques&#39; effort to detail at <a href="">5:10</a>

Still flexing my iPhone 6
We need an iPhone like 5s body with edge to edge display and a punch hole camera in the front, and with all the new features of iPhone 11 pro. Because we still love the 5s design ❤️

I have a Samsung S10  with the worst camera 😔 might cop this

Ya’ll stuck in 6s etc while im here Still loving my 5s even tho its not that big and old

MKBHD: &quot;Glass is glass&quot;Jerryrigeverything: &quot;And glass breaks&quot;

Do you think it’s a good upgrade from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 11 Pro?

When he was scrolling through all his apple devices my Jaw just DROPPED

something I don&#39;t understand is how people are &quot;super disappointed&quot; in the pixel 4 for having only 6 gigs of ram, but no one says anything about the 11 Pro for having 4 gigs? What?

THIS IS JUST A DAMM PHONE!!!

I bought an S9, July of last year and even though I am a samsung user for phones. This phone looks incredible, debating whether or not to save for it. Any help?

If i was to do this presentation i would def do it this way ;) i have to get an iphone today and ur videos are really helping me!

Hi. What smart phone do you use personally and why?

This is how many times he used ✌😐✌

Did you not say &quot;glass is glass and glass breaks&quot; because JerryRigEverything has it copyrighted 🤔

iPhone 11 Pro has AWSOME SCREENAWSOME CAMERALONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE

for someone who reviewed apple for years, im surprised how little you actually know about them.

To be honest, im watching this on my iPhone4s.

<a href="">2:47</a> heart shatters by looking at those scratches

its that notch that gets me ,SMH

the intro freaked me out

Has anyone already gotten the fucking wallpaper?
Still got a iPhone 7 bouta upgrade today
Do you guys think there will be a camera upgrade for iPhone 12??? I&#39;m skipping out on the 11 because I still love the X, but how about iPhone 12?

I feel like the way apple Design the cameras on the back is not really about good looking,but to distinguish its apple products from other products.

Link of this wallpaper please!

<a href="">1:52</a> glass is glass, and glass breaks.

Iphone 11 pro or note 10 plus, i dont know witch to buy. I am now using s9 plus.

Roses are redViolets are blueThere are three camerasIn a square cube

Maybe focus on making the phone durable(the phone is made out of glass???). I broke the back from a fall off a table and was told i need a whole new phone. Fuck you Apple.

My friend just bought the iphone6Like, why the fück would you buy an iphone 6 in 2019. And it still costed 300€! I got a brand new samsung a50 at 300€. I just don&#39;t get those ppl that buy super old phones

iPhone or iCamera ??

Does iPhone 11 and 11 pro both have the same camera?

Still rockin the iPhone 6. And I’m an IT Application Developer that writes code for a living. No big reason to change.

Who else has a 5S 😂😂😂💔💩

I don’t even care about the notch, it’s totally fine as long as the display is full.

<a href="">6:40</a> - dang his Apple ID is FULL

Hey marques! I&#39;m a fan here! Throw me any unused mobile phone you have. I&#39;ll give it to my daughter. Lame, I can&#39;t afford to buy her co&#39;z I&#39;m broke. Thanks! Appreciate it.

Jeez the way people complain about every new iphone not being as world changing as the original iphone. What a bunch of spoiled brats we’ve become. What would have to do in order to change the status quo? We’re already completely addicted to these things, im honestly worried at the prospect of these getting any better.

I like this iPhone 11 I have one like every feature.

it&#39;s the worst camera to happen at that kind of money league ! the camera to beat is huawei p30 pro and ,mate 30 pro!  &amp; samsung note 10 u might be having 10 million followers but that doesn&#39;t make you right. iphone is the US product and of course . then of course the trade issues between US china Socio Economics politics  and influences     💹🔑📉📈

BEST. INTRO. EVER.

sooooooo excited, im getting an iphone 11 pro on january 20 2020

Campare OnePlus 7t and note 10 plus..

Apple fucks

I am amazed by the camera, my friend took a picture on new year&#39;s Eve with fireworks in the background and I was blown away. Only thing apple has to do is make the switch to usb c and my next phone will be a iPhone

Am I the only one experiences lens flare in night whenever there is light source?

Who else is watching this video on their iPhone 11 Pro?

Watching this on my iPhone 6

Hey bro ,what kind of camera u be using for your reviews, their always super clear 👍🏾

I personally say the camera looks dope! But it’s my opinion

Well that was reassuring.

that intro tho

<a href="">9:28</a> is why apple is so bad.&quot;I would turn it off... But I can&#39;t.&quot;

Nice information! I just got free Samsung S9 phone cuz I signed up for a giveaway last month. I&#39;m happy af. Give it a shot - simply find Samsung Giveaway Monster on Google and join free of charge.

Where can i get his wallpaper ?

It&#39;s amazing

Upgrading from iPhone 7 Plus to 11 Pro Max today, can&#39;t wait :)

I like how he lowkey be flexing his tesla with his home screen. 😂😂

Is it Worth the upgrade?! btw i have an iPhone x/10😊

That intro was sick

I lost 32% watching this video on my 6s 😭😭

Is he using true tone or not

Where can I get this wallpaper?

just got the 11 pro. loving it so far!

Watching on my iphone 11 pro max (im so glad im 14 my parents bought me this cuz i strive and do the best i aint flexin)

Where you got the wallpaper

this is when apple makes the best iphone everno notch but it still has face id3d touch is backtouch id is backtrue 120hz display unlike fake ones on tvs5g4 cameras in square setup like the 11 proand overclockability in the os

your opinions sucks

Marques Brownlee everything is well done even tho there&#39;s a notch hahaha

If you buy Iphone you buy a device, if you buy android you buy an advertisement machine..

Just upgraded from the 6s to the pro max. What a difference lol

my iphone 5s last 30 minutes
Which color is the best I am confused between gold and space grey ?

I just upgraded from the 6s yay haha

just got my 11 pro in xmas 🤩

I bought the iPhone 11 pro max and returned it last week as the video quality was poor. The 1080 was smudgy and to be honest, my iPhone 6 took crisper footage in 1080 (not joking). The 4k was ok but took up so much storage. I think apple have forced the 4k so much that it has impacted the 1080 quality on the phone. But conveniently no reviewer talks about this. Also there is a lot of rave about the wide angle lens but once again nobody mentions that the whole image quality degrades with that lens. Try the wide angle in less than sunny conditions and you&#39;ll see how bad the pics look. Also I did not find the battery to be as great as they say. It was average. The plus points are that the phone feels premium (&amp; at that price it should do!), face unlock is fast and ios13 is a very fluid experience. If you must buy this phone, go for the iPhone 11. It has all the good stuff (cameras without the wide angle gimmick, ios13) and is £400 cheaper! But for me, all 2019 phones have been disappointing. Hopefully 2020 brings some game changers

Wallpaper link please.

Give me 4 hours I can run that battery dry.

Watching this from my amazing midnight green iPhone 11 Pro!! :)

I’ve been stuck with an iPhone se for 4 years and hear his complaints about the phone. Smh

Design: barely Display: slight upgrade Battery life: majorHotel: trivagoYour mom: FAT

I honestly really like the camera cutout (thanks to the fw3a flashlight)

Nice

i have just bought iPhone 11 pro and got problem . when i shoot video with high efficiency format i am not able to open up .mov files in my computer it opens only with audio not video. But when i shoot video with most compatible format it does work so does anybody has solution for this ? please ??? so that i can shoot in high efficiency format. thank you

What they mean by Face ID angles is if the phone is on the side of your face, it will still register. That’s what I think anyway

wallpaper ?
Contact <b>gordonhacker297</b> on Insta-gr@m he got my IPhone x max activated.. He&#39;s realible and honest..

Apple should put this video on their app (Apple Store). Great start. Great song. Great review. Great iPhone.

Looks at my iPhone 5s Me:*sniff* you’re fine
He just passed the baton to Zacks when he said glass is glass😂

I wish every youtuber had the microphone HE USES. LOL His voice is so sharp.

Thank you for making this review. It covers the pro&#39;s cons and &quot;pros&quot;😅 Yet isn&#39;t very hard to understand. Because of this, i&#39;m going to upgrade to the pro.😁

He’s the only reviewer who has the “boy next door” look/image. All the best buddy and wish you more successes. You’ve earned it

almost 10 mil!

I give it a 5/5 because rubbing the camera feels nice

Apple: it’s the toughest glassMarques: GLASS IS GLASS

Just a quick suggestion, instead of leeaaaaning towards the phone, how about picking it up?yknow, using hands?not an apple fanboy, just another human being.

I swear apple says the same thing about the glass every year.

Glass is glass and glass breaks A great man said that 😎

This is why i dont watch this guys reviews anymore what an idiot and annoying attitude

On my iPhone XS, iOS 13&#39;s Face ID speed has improved by a good amount and is very, very welcome. But it&#39;s not enough. I expected better from a AUD$1879 phone. The pinnacle of unlocking speed was fingerprint on my 2015 Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (RIP). Instant.
