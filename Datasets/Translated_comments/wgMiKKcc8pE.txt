Do comedy bhai gyan mat chodo
My first encounter with breast cancer came in 2015, when I was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or stage 2 breast cancer. At that time, I decided to have a lumpectomy to remove the small portion of my breast that was affected, followed by eight weeks of radiation and treatment with the estrogen-blocking medication tamoxifen. I had hoped that the risk of any future malignancy arising in my breast was slim after that course of action. And yet, five years later, in July 2018, my routine annual mammogram showed something suspicious, so I returned for a biopsy. The suspicion was confirmed: I had developed DCIS again in one breast. This time, it was closer to my chest wall. After several months of research and feeling unsure of what to do, Mark had finally decided to pursue treatment at Cancer Treatment Centers of America️ (CTCA), where they told us about Dr. Harvey herbal world, and his herbal product Propolis Lecithin Capsules at first we were surprised hearing them talking about herbs and roots but know they work hand to hand for the fact that Dr. Harvey had cured so many patients of cancers and other diseases so we decided to give a try. And then we contacted him and the told him about cancer problem, so he told us what to do and assured us that he is going to cure me of his herbal products made from natural herbs and roots just within two weeks, we never doubted him because we knew CTCA can never turn us down. so told us what to do and we followed his instructions and he told us how to get his herbs so we got it and gave instructions too on how I should consume it so I followed his instructions and my husband never left me behind. so started going with the herbs just within 7 days i was already feeling different seeing myself feeling strong and the lump gradually disappear then other things follow. So the second week i saw myself strong so went for checkup and found out nothing was absolutely there. Absolutely I was overwhelmed and filled with joy unexplainable. And my local doctor here was surprised so I&#39;m here just to let you all know that money is nothing compare to your health.. Health is wealth. so want you all to contact Dr. Harvey herbal world via WhatsApp on +1 475 522 1289,

I was diagnosed with intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) in October 2018 after breaking my hip. The tumor was the size of a peach. I underwent surgery in December 4th in which they removed 60 percent of my liver along with my gallbladder and three lymph nodes. I then underwent six months of Chemotherapy in pill form in which I took the pills twice a day for two weeks, and then a week of rest, then repeated this for six months it was not still getting better till i came across my ex worker whose mother was a survivor too that  told me about the special DR.HARVEY on how he cured his mother with his herbal Products so i collected his contact information thecn when i got home i contacted him and explained everything to him he told not to worry i should just send my reports which i did so he Prepared the herbal remedy and told me to purchase it which i did and he delivered it to me and gave me Guidelines on how to make use of it i did this for 2/weeks before going back and carry out Another test today I&#39;m free and totally cured all thanks to almighty God and DR.HARVEY God bless you sir.

You can contact DR.HARVEY VIA EMAIL:[Drharveyphytotherapy@yahoo.com]

WHATSAPP:+16785689096

This is also true in 2021,

For girls

Good work. I love both your content and message. You are a very great person.

After knowing men also can have breast cancerNow I&#39;m in depression

@BB KI VINES.... if you are watching my comment please make one video on Oral Cancer... As a Surgeon I regularly see and treat around 7-8 cases per month in my hospital. It is more than breast and any other parts.. please increase the awareness regarding Oral health bro...

So much respect for Bhuvan

Sad thing is he could not talk about symptoms in hindi

Bhai am a science student    But I am not sure that this things will be shred by u     Such wonderful information.

No. 1editor and actor

Currently 3.6k people have disliked this video.I can only say a sentence for them &#39;Kon hai ye log, kaha se aate hai ye log&#39;

This is indeed special ️. If you are reading this Bhuvan sir then it will be the happiest thing for me.... But mujhe pta nahi chalne vala. I wanted to say that your videos are just awesome always with some educating topics and special characters that you play. There are some more topics I hope aap samjhoge like... The gap between understanding of parents and us...1.Specially when it comes to an entrance exam and career choice. Bahot pressurise kr dete hai. 2. Sex education not only that what we find in books but kya krna chahiya kya nahi... Relationships and sex... Whom to trust or not. Galat step bhi ho jata hai kai baar. Lekin koi baat hi nahi krna chahta.... Sabko ye lagta hai ki hamare bachche ke sath kuch galat nahi hoga.3. Duty towards nation jo yaha koi samjhta nahi hai... In my surrounding4. Mental state of everybody how to be happy and make others happy... Every body is lonely deep inside..  and this mobile phone has taken the place of our loved one..And no body talks about to stay happy and to behave in that way so as to make other happy.Aur moral education ki to bahot jyada kami hai... I wish If I get a response from you!

Love you BB... You are really a very good human....️️️

Mere mami ko hua tha ek bar lekin bho cure ho gya

Today is women&#39;s day So,Happy women&#39;s day to all the women&#39;s
