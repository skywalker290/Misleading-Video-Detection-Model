SHAME ON YOU FOR CURSING THE HOLY FOOL YOU FOOL!!! THE VIRGIN SAVED YOU!!! GRATITUDE IN ALL ITS GREATNESS!
Who leave so many dogs! Hey police where are you? Livestock breeders of bad times are cancerous to society (they don't eat, don't be afraid)
he wants to smell you
We've planted hashish over there, you shouldn't cross, that's why we have so many dogs
You're a cop to our paparazzi. take it easy, take the baby out because you filled it with shit
What business do you have, the cane-wielding, uncivilized one who doesn't even know what the word law means...And now they're walking free.....Greece, your majesty
Stupid, out of touch with dogs - they don't yell at dogs like that
Look on the bright side, millions of views, you should thank them
A pack of dogs and not a sheep to guard them...
I cried😂😂
You know how much I laughed when I saw that... Then I thought they were going to eat you... keep your cool 😂
the funniest video ever
And yet the bike saved you, that's why they were afraid and didn't rush...

Did you finally confess or are things still like this?
It takes 3 sheep to feed them a month

Listen to what the other one is saying, as if the road is opening for him. He had to throw two candlesticks at him. Fuck your education
Listen to what the other one is saying, as if the road is opening for him. He had to throw two candlesticks at him. Fuck your education
There are flocks here says the shepherd. In our mind, what are you saying, it's a road for everyone. I love your education, you Vlachs
Finally what happened? Did she sue him? Did the gentleman state he is a police officer or did I mishear?
very serious until the moment of the shepherds 😅😅... here and there..... anyway, the guy knew what he had to do, very correct
Dude I've been through this not with 25 but with a single wild one that was ready to mount me. I felt your position. Glad you got away with it don't laugh they would eat you
Hey mlk, you too should have called the police on the spot 😒
AHAHAHAHAHA

Who is this Jessica and how's she supposed to help? But joking aside, anyone who is concerned about &quot;balanced&quot; Dog training complaints should come out of such a situation unscathed and think about what exactly prevented further escalation.
I had also experienced something like this when I was 13 with the bike, only there were 3 dogs but almost twice as many
Shit Dogs

I've had a deaf wolfdog happen to me so the gun does nothing
HE SHOULD LIKE A MAN LIGHTNING 2 SLAPS AT ALL ALL THE DOGS AND TWO MORE AT THE SHEPHERD
&quot;Weapon&quot; which emits ultrasound (&gt; 20kHz) at a deafening intensity for the dogs. 😂
I find you too much man. They only wanted to smell you 😂😂😂. Seriously now, kudos for your reaction
And then people ask me why i made my <a href="">#short</a> about it..people on youtube are simply dumb, and cant understand a simple joke..

the biggest threat in these parts is neither wolves nor bears but sheepdogs...
the shepherd had an itch hahahahaha. he tells you not to go through here, there is a flock hahahaha listen to what the shepherd said
Both me and my mother have been bitten by cow dogs with motorbikes on different occasions (we had the motorbikes, not the dogs:). In my case, I was driving and one got in front of me to slow down and the other came from the side and bit me... it's happened to me many times before, but I escaped. In the case of my mother, the same pit bulls, she was a passenger in my father's motorcycle and they bit her on the leg as well. In every case like this, we the motorcyclists get it out of the way, don't let them throw it at us... and all this in the middle of the city of Chania, not in any countryside... And the municipal authority plays it ignorant
In their bad weather That's why they want them, to make the uneducated laugh That's why
Tsoglanakos. He really should be sued.
Helladistan
Shooting of both dogs and their owners!
Dogs protect the area and farmers take them to protect their hens if you are in the wilderness and no cars pass and they see you, it is reasonable to pass you as a threat and want to drive you out of the area, that's why the farmers train them

I think I would step inside that lake in this situation :) I went mountain biking on Sithonia 5 times over last few years and EVERY time I was met at least once and in one ride three times by Greek shepherd dogs. Those HUGE ones. Once 6 of them chased me full speed because it was a slight downhill through the valley. All other times it was uphill and luckily every time there was a man somewhere to call them. I once asked the shepherd will I be able to pass through on the way down and he told me that if he&#39;s not there I should move VERY slowly. I still don&#39;t understand how can this be legal? Because it really ruins such fantastic trails through incredible nature. The worst part is that as soon as you climb to the top, and a lot of different roads and ways open up, you immediately meet these dogs and some of them are very aggressive. I thought I learned that it&#39;s safe if you get off the bike and slowly walk. This video proves it&#39;s not always like that.

You haven't been to Turkey in rural areas to see 20 dogs in each herd of kangals, you won't have time to blink and your eyes will have eaten you.
You don't need to curse all Saints 😊
You are right. But you're not a police officer.
If women and children passed by 😢
The man had a pack of dogs.. He took them out to feed them.. A tiger guards them 😅!... Seriously now.. Well done to the courage of the cyclist!
This is how murders happen...
he almost died but he said: very good
Logically, they have the corral to feed the dogs
I like the reaction of the Albanians, what else can they say &quot;It's okay, they won't see you&quot; if you blow the whistle they will stop they are illiterate they don't know how to look after their animals the other one in the meantime as if he has just woken up ANYWAY I see the area as very dangerous especially at night they won't leave even 1 pedestrian standing to walk around
You should have had a gun.....
Luckily you didn't fall into a pack of wolves....😂🤣
The only thing that is certain is that everyone entered the comments and directly judged the incident without having put themselves in the shoes of either of them.
There is only one solution! Fola, not for dogs for idiots who abuse dogs!
Yes, the dogs teased you, not the humans
You will never catch the Virgin Mary in your mouth again! Panagia.

The Stanes are in nature, logically, dogs must be there to protect wolves and thieves, corrals do not do their job, so we make sure to be ready and as cool as possible, whistle, water, branch if we are on foot
They want to smell you
Anyway, I see two dogs with a strong aggressive tongue, showing teeth, etc. The rest are sharing tails here and there and showing curiosity more than anything. Not that I wouldn't have cried mints, but let's talk now.

And the bosses in Greece are like dogs.
One reason I fear cycling and hiking in Greece, I grew up in a village and still have traumatic experiences with sheepdogs…
In Indonesia, if any dog ​​is fierce, its head will be separated from its body tomorrow
The supposed owner is for many fapes
&quot;If she was a woman she would have been eaten alive&quot; feminazi triggered
A month ago in Thessaloniki I was walking with a friend and we were attacked by 12 sheepdogs like these here. Luckily there was a tree next to it and we climbed up. Sheepdogs are the greatest danger in the Greek nature and even in a corral they can go outside.
I was running, he says to save you... K is coming slower than the delay itself!!! Mercy! It's happened to me.. Hiking, countless times and I've dropped something dogs!!! There is no such thing!
Oh the scumbag.....she must have fallen for him...She fell for him!! I understand him...

Complaint on the spot, not me
Same scene as Gregory Peck in the Etruscan cemetery in the movie The Prophecy!!!!Hahahahahahahaha!!!!!
One of them is fine, you move away, and if he is just guarding, he doesn't take you hunting. Here, it's fine, the work stinks and the kids have so many dogs, we live in Greece, real estate + basic needs get around 700 euros, food to feed so many dogs how much will it cost you, if possible. And if the dogs don't eat well as an owner you will start to regret the day you took them over and they looked distressed, here the guys bought a whole pet shop let's say with so many dogs, the same with a pack of wolves setting it up for you, the guy got it, only with them he really wouldn't be spared. the fines (killing the animal is never the solution, especially when it has an owner), the right thing is for the owner: A.) To be deprived of the ownership of the animal as he is deemed completely irresponsible for its careB.) It is meant to cover with his own costs the necessary medical treatment that the injured person will receive from his animal, he is obliged, the injured person is not to blame for anything that was attacked by any other owner's animal.C.) Obviously the owner of the animal who acted against any victim, will must also pay the corresponding fine or additional penalties may be imposed on him based on the law.

What kind of shepherds are there? They think that the mountain and the roads belong to them.
They want to smell you
😃😃😃😃

Poison. The owners need to sniff. ValVik.
I was running from everywhere to save you! No, don't be afraid, they wouldn't eat you.
this would of ended really bad had the owners not come in!!

All 50 😂😂
Always carry pepper spray/repellent.

This is why china eats their wild dogs😁

They want to smell you soooooo 🤣🤣🤣 Joking aside, I in particular would have passed out or dived into the lake back...
25+2 animals
You ar lacky man, dis is not wilde dogs...

The other shepherd comes galloping...lol...😆 😂
Why free this dog call police👮

- Did you get food for the dogs?- No need, the cyclists are fine.
A lot of audacity. And if you have dog lips, you are obliged to keep them closed..
If they threw you down, we would even eat the bike.
At least you don't march...
<a href="">2:41</a> &quot;if you whistle once they stop&quot;.... Meanwhile exactly 2 minutes earlier: <a href="">0:41</a> 😂😂😂🤣
Did you finally chase the shepherd mate? This shouldn't stay like this...
Everywhere I saw two of these pups were in other mischievous moods...
So once me and a friend of mine were returning from fishing, I had a DT 200 the friend behind me! Stop, he says, I know how to calm them down!! Stones.. They would eat us, I tell him hold on!! I march one, I leave with souza and I pressed and made 2!! that's how we saved her
Guys, just kidding, if it was a woman or small children they would have devoured them, this is not funny!!

Hey, what kind of dogs are these
A few years ago, 4 sheepdogs jumped out of a corral and fell on me while I was driving by and they started biting the sheet metal.
I've seen this in a nightmare
It's like a movie, when the bosses pop all the voices stop and the acting starts
The other man, instead of saying sorry, is already talking. Selfish jerk
What are they feeding all these grasses?
Special route, red bull 🐂, what happened in the end, you passed through there again
I'm sure you're passing by on purpose and bothering them all the time. I saw your other video too. By chance you also had the camera open. Leave me alone dude...
Don't be afraid, they won't bite you, man, and when I see a dog running at me, I don't scream or shout because we were afraid because the dog doesn't know us and it might bite
-These are a bit wild ..!😅😅😄
He should not have been given to them, he should have filed a lawsuit on the spot to take away his corral, the shepherds think that the road belongs to them and that they have the right to have their dogs free
I hope you got the millions from them 😅

DISASTER HOW MANY DOGS GOD AND LET THEM OUT AN INCONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PEOPLE HERE A DISASTER HAPPENS THE SAME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE BUT I IMAGINE THE MAN SHOULD HAVE SEE SAID ABOUT EVERY PEOPLE IN M.....
Don't shout it out don't grab any fines for abusing a dog...
Anyone who has lived through a similar scene is not laughing at all, the penultimate time I escaped with a bite, because the shepherd was nearby ... he tells me you didn't have a stick .. the stones don't catch ... I took two pieces of wood the day before yesterday, I'm going again ... only I don't I was eaten I climbed the rocks like a spider..I saved her with an inkwell... now I'm looking for an alternative self defense no horn maybe a pole like boba fett. Because the choirboys don't mess around..
You have to go around with a carousel... Not for dogs...

Well done to the man for his composure!! Anyway, I would have thrown myself... The other guy wants 50 dogs, keep 2-3 at the most, for your herd... not 50!
You didn't file a lawsuit, nor did you hear an apology! A hole in the water, pointless video!

For these events, extremely serious measures must be taken against the owners of the dogs, who are nothing more than probable murderers. If it hadn't been for their intervention, the cyclist would certainly have been mauled. Not everyone has the intellectual capacity to adopt animals.

Dude, only your soul knows what you pulled. About 5 years ago, our friend's dog fell on my uncle and four men did not do well. Luckily she escaped. I imagine what it's like to have 25 sheepdogs fall on you...
Don't be afraid to play they just want to...

This particular video was analyzed on a BBC show if I remember correctly and they said he did exactly what he had to do to keep the guy alive, if he sat still or tried to run the bike he was dead!
If she was a woman, she would have been eaten alive!
And you're a policeman, after all
When you accuse Andreas Papandreou in the 80s-90s in a Greek cafe...
Hey, you're dead, what's this?
this is really a problem, you want to go to nature and you are afraid of being killed by strays. I don't know if having a loud whistle helps or even better with ultrasound.
TO CALL THE POLICE WHAT DID YOU SAY AND BEGG THEM?
An incident from 2012 has it on makeleio as news today.
never on the mountain without a weapon
If this happened in any America and it was actually a cop...I'd still be burying dogs..
He spared her...
Don't be afraid to be smelled, they want my cuties..
As he shouts how not to attack him? Before he shouted the dogs were not aggressive. When they see the other person outside themselves they will attack it is logical!!
This is the comment in Spanish you were looking for
They only want to smell you and play!

Hey, I'm laughing 😂😂😂😂 where he says marry your Virgin Mary, don't urinate
It will do them good, the road is not private if he wants so many dogs freely to teach them not to bite or to put his flock together with the dogs in another fenced area. I had prepared for the news on the channels "biker angel in the sky"
The friend has become a shepherd and he managed well! He did the right thing!
I had a similar incident when I was 9 years old with 8 dogs and in the village. Since then I don't want to see them
Take it easy, they wanted to smell you 😂😂

Unforgettable video
O.M.G 😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨
And also what he says about the woman, has come to pass. At the point where the herd I came across, a short time later, while hiking, was attacked and eventually ended up in the hospital.
I have been in a similar situation with 21 dogs. It is neither pleasant nor easy. However, one mentions that &quot;if you whistle they stop&quot;. It worked for me. With a whistle they started wagging their tails. It does NOT mean compulsion is the right approach though. It takes effort to achieve it only if you can. Voices are also another good approach just smell the tension and go on the attack. I note that although I was once bitten by a dog I have no phobia, on the contrary I love them very much.
If you whistle once they stop
They just wanted to play hehe

If the shepherds had not escaped, he would most likely have videotaped his own death. Fortunately, everything went well for the man and we laughed too.
Don't worry though, bones eat too
ok I wouldn't want to be in his position but whenever it comes to my mind I cry :) . Sorry mate honestly, be well always
What I see about women and feminism Because the gentleman said if it was a woman I have to say that I am very sorry, he is absolutely right he was 100 kilos as much as he was if a petite woman passed by there was a chance Not even 1 in a million that the dogs wouldn't have attacked her
File a lawsuit, you worthy one

I love dogs, but like aggressive people -I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to shoot them. If I&#39;m on a public roadway and even two dogs could easily kill me, I would react with appropriate violence but only in defense of my life and without apology.

Hello,.. any chance someone could please translate what the cyclist said to the dog owners? Please and thank you!

2021 are you doing??
He uploaded it to YouTube so we can help him laugh. Stupid

The place is full of such big-headed dog owners, they don't bite! I will not say about the legislation!

That's what you buy dog ​​repellants for
&quot;They don't eat&quot; ... says t@gari at 2.37&#39;. What can one say, the state is again absent and they think they are in their own place. Hostus, rent for every square meter of land they use and you will see how many people become people who respect human life because if he was in his position and was more afraid or fell down they would have killed him
Failed attempt at intimidation by the cyclist. As soon as he saw that the shepherds were not chewing, he said to inform them that he was a policeman. &#39;&#39;I am a policeman&#39;&#39;. Unnecessary information. I'm an Aquarius too. What does this have to do with the incident? Would it make any difference if the cyclist was a baker or a stall holder? If you think you're right, file a lawsuit.
Since he has the courage at the end and laughs !!!!

Just kidding, the man is right. If you want to have fifty mutts. But make sure they are bolted to your fence. Otherwise, people are at risk. I had a similar incident. But luckily there were only two German ones and I caught the chuck! 😁

What happens in Greece with dogs does not play out in any other country. I have returned to mountains in Italy, Switzerland and Bulgaria and felt completely safe. Here each shepherd has 10 goats and 15 dogs. You can't walk or ride a bike. Let me also remember the man who was killed in Thessaloniki this year and so many attacks that are carried out by packs of strays or by sheepdogs.
If I was there with a gun I would kill myself. You can't get away with anything from here.... At least I would have left quickly and with a pain.

Lawsuit wants the little guy to play it dude afterwards. The spoiled brat also asks for change. Did the biker finally sue? Because then, if something happens, he is jointly responsible.
The bastard said there's a herd of coots

My good friend PODILATIS,you had to put immediately in prison this bastard young man,who instead to say to you sorry 1 milion times,he was arguing and opposing you.If i was instead of you, i was putting him in jail with my two hands.Bravo my friend for your generosity and braveness saving your life and not giving a punch to the face of this stupid shepherd.Merry Christmas my friend!

Those are greek shepherd dogs

The thing with dogs is terrible in Greece!!!! You are at risk of being bitten, eaten, scared.... In other words, I am obliged to put up with on a PUBLIC road, and even a lot with ASPHALT, every small or big dung that every moron or moron decided to feed and keep on the sidewalk barking at me, snapping at me, nz chasing me or biting me??? And are answers the &quot; Doesn't bite &quot; , &quot; Never mind &quot; And I don't know what! Go to hell! Do you want a dog or dogs???? Take everything, put it in your house, in your kitchen, in your bed, write your fortune to them, marry them if you want, but don't play the stranger who is just crossing a village or city street!!!!

50 dogs to guard the sheep, i.e. each sheep has its own personal guard, whoever was there would have X... on him
Boss, if you didn't raise your voice, they would eat you... the dogs were running right and left, if you were to take them from the middle, they would drown you... and the other one, instead of saying sorry, tells you from above... yes, they don't eat humans
Don't be afraid, they only want to encourage you to go up the hill, they realized that your pace dropped and they wanted to motivate you...

(because the Greek also takes out the court decision before the judge)5. I have faced dogs like lions but it was 2-3 not 10 also I have killed the Lernaean Hydra but I don't say it don't be sad Heracles......Mercyssss Besides these are idiots who leave such dogs will kill no human

When you yell at dogs quietly, isn't it normal for them to bark and growl when they feel threatened? If you hadn't yelled like ..... there wouldn't have been so many dogs gathered and you would have been able to cross your path cool and nice 💁🏼‍♀️
This was entered national geographic, I'm not kidding
you should have sued those who would come after you and trample on her... there is no need for kindness to such people.

Several times in a similar situation but never alone always with one more person and we get off between the bikes. If there is any wood nearby, you take that too.
They have surrounded him, men, how can the man escape?
The other says what do you want and you cross the street since there are corrals here. It's as if the road is theirs or you shouldn't cross because they've been told to keep the dogs out of sight.
You're laughing, the same thing happened to me right outside the lidl in Kozani, 1 kilometer from Kozani - Thessaloniki. Fortunately, a young man stopped and helped me escape from the strays. The classic response of the police was, it's not our job, call the Municipality... Oh, you people who want freedom, dogs.....

It happened to me that I was running in Tritsi park and a Malinois dog rushed at me, creating a mess on my calf. I just caught up and collected my leg. Instead of apologizing, the owner told me that I was running. Classic complex people with the wild dogs. I also had a dog for years but when it was in public I didn't have it free and let it eat. You softies, don't be donkeys. A little responsibility
They only want to smell you!!!
Don't be afraid he wants to smell you.

What is the joke of the case? Even if the man wants to leave, he cannot, the dogs have closed him in and squeezed him.
I bet the Vlach is hiding there with so many dogs. Anyone who knows knows that they don't need so many dogs.

In case you are wondering what they are talking about, the guy that comes running is the owner of the dogs. He is a sheepherder that keeps these dogs to guard his sheep. He said that the biker shouldn&#39;t go through that road. The biker got furious because this is a public road meant for bikers and kept saying that he was lucky to escape alive, that the dogs were close to attacking him and that he is gonna sue the sheepherder. In the end they seemed to calm down.

I have stitches from a sheepdog on my hand😂 you don't mess with such dogs.. Especially if you also have a bike... Then God be with you
Guys, I would go down and tell them: Come eat me, let's finish an hour earlier

You uneducated people when you don't know you won't talk...You keep blaming animal lovers and put them on another level as if they are not human..Clearly in the video we see that humans are irresponsible as always and not the dogs who are doing their job ...If it was fenced and it was inside, nothing would have happened...But it's usually the dogs and the animals in general that you don't have an education to blame...

Let's get together with the goat marriages
For all the pseudo culture chicks in the comments...Let me remind you that this was a SHEPHERD DOG. This breed of dog (because it is a specific breed of dog) will attack <b>anyone</b> who trespasses on their owner's property. With these dogs, you don't play it cool. They will kill you, or at best, seriously injure you. The only way to push them away is to <b>shout as loud as you can.</b>Otherwise mate, good luck... And you really look like you're serious about the &quot;dogs self-confidence gone down&quot;... Besides that it wasn't the dogs that were the victims. The cyclist was the one who would be slaughtered on the spot if he did nothing. <b>BECAUSE THE CYCLER JUST YELLED FOR HIS BODY INTEGRITY.</b> He did nothing else. What would you do? You see in front of you the herd of wild sheepdogs. With their teeth out and their mouths foaming. Would you stay in a state of nirvana, which in the final stretch would kill you, or would you defend yourself? 99% the second. Because when your life is threatened, you don't think morally. You think about saving yourself. And don't say &quot;quiet baby&quot;. 25 sheepdogs attack you. Oh my god, I fuck your fraternity. And also, that fucking phrase: &quot;ONLY IN GREECE DOES THIS HAPPEN&quot;, man, <b>Dude,</b> these things happen everywhere. And worse. Do you really want me to quote you about similar incidents in Germany with Rottweilers and German Shepherds? Or in Russia? Or anywhere else? These kinds of incidents happen everywhere. But a specific one happened and was recorded by a cyclist in Greece, who was attacked by a pack of sheepdogs. It's not just happening here. Just a resident of Greece happened, while filming his mountain biking, to record this incident. <b>Nothing else.</b> But it does not only happen in our country. And I assure you that it is not the worst. Still others say that this shows the violation of animal rights in Greece. Sorry, sorry...Since when were dogs attacked? Because the cyclist swung his bike forward? If he didn't do that, then he'd be dog food. These types of comments I get all raving about are for the following reason: those who leave these types of comments are the same pseudo-cultural leftists/marxists, who in order to force the their vile ideology in every aspect of Greek social life, they say that Greeks are regressive in everything, and that at all costs we must become &quot;socially responsible towards animals, towards equality (so as not to be sexist &#39; Greeks&#39;), regarding homosexuality (so that you don't react when abnormal people kiss small children on the mouth and strip in front of them and have orgies) and * regarding &#39;nationalism&#39; (so that you are not racist and the immigrants commit crimes while you give them benefits, racist Greek)&quot;. Everything is connected. And the fact that the pro-shepherd comments are from the same people who support them. Sorry for the rambling.

I love dogs but this Greece has a problem with dogs 4 friends have fallen off a motorcycle from wild strays I've eaten 2 times attacked by a herd.....they go they mate them sell them and then the other one can give up and no one only the dog has a problem and if it's wild the trigiro...Shut up and stop breeding without permission
Are you fucking the other person or not?
GUARD GUARD WHO IS THE GUARD HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where are the animal lovers to start &quot;dogs are babies&quot;And something else dude, well springs up, then how did you come back?
A brave Greek

He wants to play
The luminaries have 25 dogs which they have trained to be watchdogs and let them loose on the street. Obviously they will eat a human since they are GUARDS. They protect the area pointed out to them by the useless bosses. We also have the idiots swearing at dogs as if they wanted to eat a cyclist. I hope the lawsuit was filed.

You who say you're going to sue him have also put their faces without their permission, so you too can eat it badly

Keep a nice iron and lay them down one by one.. A bullet in the head each and bye.. And to any animal lover who comments another bullet in his own head as well.. And so in Chania we go delivery with the motorbike and they were chasing us on a main road with some mules moving like this, you will either run away from the dog or from the car that will crash you in your attempt to escape the dog..
Border collies are... 1,500 euros each... you can't even call them wild strays

I believe they wouldn't have killed one or two of them if they were the wild ones, the white one was combative, the others seemed calm, especially something, but they just sat and looked
I like that he put the title in English to get international dimensions WHAT A FOOL
I know he says I'm from a village with dogs. As if you are from a village, you must know about dogs. Terrible argument
Top lines though guys the other says &quot;be careful they will eat humans they don't eat don't be afraid&quot; and when he was looking away the dogs were coming one by one closer to pounce and the other one said &quot;aman the supports stop&quot; here the other one went to have a heart attack and was shouting and nothing happened, you are working for us
Well done to the cyclist for his composure
What do you know about dogs, you're kidding us. With the shouts and gestures you go to drive the dogs away? Just so you know, dogs with shouts and gestures get angrier. You are also from a village
QUIET REI
You uploaded a video where because you got laid you started yelling and threatening. Below, most of them went even further and write about weapons, guns, euthanasia and generally killing people and animals. Meanwhile in the video it is clearly seen that the dogs became aggressive because you were hostile towards them. The &quot;if she was a woman&quot; constituted the wretchedness of the video. In general, download it, please, we don't need any more reasons for hatred to be born and reproduced.
MY SECRETS I'M DISAPPOINTED WHERE ARE YOU?
Other dogs, other sheepdogs. The wildest dog is the Greek shepherd. They easily devoured him. However, they don't have so many dogs only for sheep... The work stinks.

Fortunately, you got me out of a difficult situation with the next video you uploaded, when you're riding around in the dirt with your bike and especially next to the corral alone, you're more likely to be raped by a geek, now as for the comments that encourage you to file complaints, next time you are at the zoo do a somersault in the lion cage and when you come out in the form of poo, file a complaint,
The guy on the bike is violating the privacy of dogsShowing their faces without their consent!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone who blames the cyclist is like that idiot who owns the dogs....just

Now you know what it's like to be a Raid Boss.

This "I'm a policeman" and the &quot;I will sue you&quot;.. as if someone who is not a policeman does not know how to sue.. &quot;I will tell my uncle the policeman and you will see what he will do to you&quot;!!!
The guy is riding a mountain bike with the wheel to drop them and they died in pain.
I've been in a worse situation... I ALWAYS calmly got down to their height, reached out without fingers to let them smell me (ah and without shouting like the lord from here does, they scare and become more aggressive. Hard for some to understand) . The bus driver was soft, but even the one with the bike STILL doesn't know how to behave in these situations.
Calm down, the dogs wanted to smell you 😂😂😂

If she was a woman they would eat her. <b>FEMINISTS TRIGGERED</b>
Animal lover means inhumane. Because they put the life of the animal above the life of the human. The dog attacks you? Look at you, baby, nothing happened... the dog attacks you and you punch him hard in the mouth and then he runs away whining? dozens of depraved animal lovers are thrown and threaten to press charges against you.

If only I had a carbine in my hands and I would have drained everything
As soon as I opened the video, dogs in the neighborhood started barking, so I said to comment... There are many truths about the dog, the most competent person to comment is Mr. Panagiotis Melas on his channel. but I will also say an almost indisputable truth: the dog is, through the domestication of crossbreeds, artificial selection and the like, a new species which, at least through human intervention, arose from the wolf, which is a cow animal and sometimes a man-eater. So how true are those that Panagiotis the hayabousas will tell you what I wrote to you.
<b>WANT TO SMELL YOU m0n0 !!!1!!!!11!!!</b>
The softie who goes baby in the pee!
Hahhahahha reyyyy
They want to smell you
In such a case, you do not curse the Virgin... quite the opposite...
I suggest that we should write the comments in English so other people can understand too

Popo

The other guy doesn't speak at all, he says... he's Albanian, you fool, he doesn't know Greek...
They would eat me
Are you an idiot too? You should leave straight away
They want to smell you...
They would make you a snack 😅😅😅😜
give the dogs man and get 3 bears to do your work for her
THEY WANT TO PLAY GTPS
If he was a policeman and he killed any dog ​​to save his life, everyone would curse the policeman. Hey you stupid you all animal lovers.. You have leveled everything!! A human life is worth less than a dog's. Why am I saying this? this? when a man defends himself to save his life from a dog and throws balls at him breaking any teeth from the &lt;&lt;poor&gt;&gt; little dog or do they stab the dog to save its life, you would say old man you hit the unfortunate dog, what was wrong with you to hit it alive..while when a dog attacks a person they send him to the hospital you are all hahahuhuhu come on big man it didn't kill you anyway, how do you do that, an animal attacked you out of instinct, if the whole pack attacks you then you should speak up and not just one dog (if the whole pack attacks him, he won't even have time to shout for help), an animal is... THAT'S RIGHT AN ANIMAL!! And an animal cannot have the consciousness that a human has..come on mlkes.You make fun of people who are in hospitals while a dog if it strikes and has made the first attack then you defend it..
Hahahahaha, I can't +1 if you're Greek, give me a sub as well😉
Hahahaha... what business do you have going through there???? What is it?
I cried
Guys, I didn't see any sheep...
The dogs had taken out their teeth and if they started the game it was over..
Don't be afraid, they just want to smell you. 😅
you won't put the Virgin Mary in your mouth again, softly and softly
THEY WANT TO SMELL YOU!!
It's not like... They want to smell you
I hope he got the dogs do paint. We also have cat lovers who support them. They put dogs lives before humans. Dead dog
If I saw so many, since I can't, I would die of terror
Hahahahaha if I file a complaint he says I'm a policeman 😂😂😂 and the other guy has his pants off

He had no sheep, good work hashish guys! He had them guarding his crop 🤣
Well said
Did Panagia protect you and curse you? Shame, although you have all the rights except the blasphemy. Please don't do it again.
Don't be afraid to play they want
Dogs bark at bad people ... and yes man will have what he likes ... hey .. the Rottweilers would eat him poor man .. UST
Fuck you man, the magic is gone
Don't be afraid to smell you, he just wants to..

The dogs are not harmed, this shepherd is to blame for letting them loose
He is right, very right
In a zombie apocalypse, how easily do you escape it?
Well, it sounds good to you too! What business do you have riding your bike on a public road that is for that purpose? what business do you have to go on a road that was made for you, my dear! Listen to what the other person said. This is what happened to us in Greece, guys, the other has 25 shepherd dogs like a cow, and it's his fault the cyclist who passed by and scared him! Hahah... What did we pull!

The dogs try to steal his bike. Luckily it was the wrong size bike for the dogs.

If they have 25 dogs, imagine how many sheep they will have..

WHO IS BUSTING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD?
I know from dogs he says... hahaha!!!!! He had to get off the bike and talk to them nicely and politely...at first they were wagging their tails, then he started shouting aaaaah,,,,uuuuuuuu,,,,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.....and they responded accordingly...
tutorial...how not to treat dogs...
Dude, next time you see a donkey dog ​​in the distance on a country road, jump into the lagoon if it's nearby, good time, and they'll swim the rest of the way. You don't have to wait for the rest of the company. Or have a tomigan with you, alternatively.
Wild Greece should have been the title
if one started to bite him he would be bitten and the other species had taken their place behind the chumps I would have fucked them one way or another
Not even a bear approaches, not a wolf!
-Don't be afraid, they don't eat (In the middle, a dog swallows his right leg)
&quot;The animals are fine. Not like humans.&quot;&quot;Don't be afraid. He doesn't bite. Every day I leave him alone with the baby and he hasn't done anything to him.&quot;And I wish they would eat you. Who thinks that because you have a dog in your home you have become both zoologists and environmentalists.
g70ful And here's the proof of how stupid you can be that you threw your shit out of your own accord.. in all your comments you judge the cyclist and say that he put his bike in front of him as a shield as well as just by the movement of him bending over to catch a stone would frighten 20 sheepdogs who have been taught to protect their space..that's what you claimed in your previous comments...and right after that you say that at most 2.3 dogs fell on the slab from what I understand and you couldn't to cope... they tore your shirt and you fought, you tell us... where did your knowledge with the &quot;stones&quot; and the bicycle &quot;shield&quot; go? you idiot? You are only for criticism, but from what I can see from my mind, you moron... If it was like you say, you fool, we would all grab a stone and because there would be more than 20 sheepdogs, we would go into the sheepfold and take a sheep... what a fool you are playing..Yes, ESPECIALLY the village dogs are taught to bark as soon as they see someone bending down to pick up a stone..while the dogs in the cities are taught to rush in a similar situation hahahahahaha what else are we going to read mercy..Unless you meant that the village dogs have it innate by themselves to understand the movement of &quot;&quot;I bend down to pick up a stone&quot; and they calm down... Whereas the dogs in the cities respectively don't have it in their instincts and just rush at you frantically.. which if you actually think about it like that you are at least tragic.. 🤣
That's where you get a revolver and start shooting both the dogs and the bosses
And then the pseudo-animal lovers come out and say why they are poisoning them.
Come on man, I lost myself watching it on video, and it was all beasts!!?
Friend, you should know that the more you shout at them, the wilder they get
No, brother, they wanted to smell you
Holy friend you had
I await feminist comments on &quot; if she was a woman she would have been eaten alive &quot;
How out of touch you are, you have no idea about animals pity.
Let the dogs be afraid of the people, man
you are cursing, but what does it mean, it is not a permanent installation, but a stable one with a stall, does anyone know this, he has a job there. road again, from here it starts neither the dogs fly nor you, on this road you know that people pass by, you don't give adieu to stables installation, good evening to all
Gamw tin panagia sou 😂😂😂
Hey man, how did you threaten the animals with the bike like that? Aren't you a little embarrassed?
They would eat them alive!!... &quot; We have things here...&quot;..&quot;they don't eat, don't be afraid..&quot; imitation
The fact that they have dogs and run them free without considering that someone might walk by and pounce on them really drives me crazy. Everywhere in Greece the same scene, be afraid to drive around, because some people don't take care of their dogs

Next ride. Put a whip in your back pack.

Speaking Russian?

THIS IS A SCARY SCENE. I WOULD HAVE KILLED ALL THOSE WILD DOGS.

uploading a video with an english title and zero actual english in it is top tier trolling.

Just an English comment coming though

I have no idea what they are talking about but I&#39;m guessing the cyclist is blaming the 2 guys for the dogs. I&#39;m so confused can someone explain what&#39;s going on

If I were in his position, he would take out his work weapon and I would drown them in bullets..
