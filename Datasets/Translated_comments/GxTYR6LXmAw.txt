You wanna walk on water?<a href="">

Those are sick

Hahaha! I always used to joke about there one day being a Nike Water and not Nike Air!

They should make ZamZam ones for Muslims 🤔

U know satan shoes

The fact that u step on holy water is a blasphemy

<a href="">0:55</a> Treasure of Nadia Overworld Theme😂😂😂

Lil has x 😂❤ he’ll noI need the Jesus ones

Nike : Thanks Ozark for the few drops of water 💦 👍😂🤣

boy, this looks like a chinese shoe with a defect embedded by mistake (bubbles inside coz a machining failure :-D  ) but, lets go for the practical benefits of these bubbles  - &quot;water&quot; - how possible is this to be compressed from a human weight - well.. at least the entire structure can expand at some point.. BUT adding air - well - this can be compressed :-D

soo you pay $800+ or more for water what is the world come to

Lil Nas X disliked this video

what about the stripper with golf fish heels? been done before and better nike!

This was made to Counteract the Satan Shoes.

worse than satan shoes imo

Imagine a water edition of every Airmax

Me :Mom he walks on water!Mom : who? Me : Mom : where&#39;s my broom stick.

C’mon guys let’s get rid of the HOLY WATER and just focus on the kicks! (They really are a nice pair of trainers)......NIKE AIR MAX 97 💯❤️👍🏾

1,000

hello. Are they original or copie? I&#39;ve got one but i don&#39;t know how can I spot them. Thanks

DRIP

Isn&#39;t it disrespecting Jesus to wear him as a shoe?

Water max

You literally cannot wear this shoes without walking like a God.

They are water max

lixo

That’s cool.

Imagine walking up to church with these bad boys. Jit bouta have the holiest drip at church ong

Imagine wearing this and the santan shoes

Naw there’s no difference from lil nas X version … that’s crazy they even put blood on the tung with the crucifix..

Yet again, Christianity is used for its true purpose. Commercialization and profiteering.

The stupidest shoe I have ever seen in my life

Stupidest looking man I have ever seen in my life

You can pick those ugly shoes and shove Up the Wazoo

What is ugly looking shoe

The cross represent sex worshyp Jesus in number in Greek ys 666 the name op the beast in latin mean earth pig comes hebrew that mean abomination correcty Yahushua Rew (REV;13

I&#39;m gonna buy these shoes if I have to hurt myself for it❤️

They have a stain 🥲

Jesus shoes
<a href="">3:34</a> literally had no clue what he just said 🤣

Would these be acceptable as church shoes?

Hi. A quick question. Does India make Nike shoes?
Me on Nike by you

they&#39;re fake. the water needs put in the AJ retro 1s. My reasoning is that you can&#39;t see holiness and admittedly they were banned like christianity occultism should be :D fuck your casadro right mike?

I love that when you took off Cross when you wear ❤️❤️❤️

Love it .. really nice gesture ..

Oh my holysneakers

God.. let me go back.. Oct 8th 2019.
Ok hear me out, what iiif what if they had coca cola inside of them?

<a href="">3:37</a>Song name

Ah…perfect for all of my christian Hypebeasts

I really want them

it is just a shoe filled with water .....what is soooooo special about them ?????????

This is not real

The Pope Francis should get these

Liquid, contrary to gas, is non compressible. Kinda defeats the functionality of the cushion.

The father at my church wears these 😭

African kids looking at this😧

When the bubble pops I guess it will be more obvious when there’s no water left in them 🤣🤣

100cc ink with 1 drop of holy water

Nike Water Max

i have holy water from jordan

That is… this is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.Yea people are gonna look at you alright, they’re gonna look at you and think, does that idiot have water shoes?

<a href="">3:45</a> reminded me of the meme sound  lol!

Nike really said lets do a collab with jesus

water in air bubblee

I like the Satan shoes better

all fun and games til that water evaporates lmfao

When it pops?

When li nas x became vegian

It’s a colab with Jesus.

I ever get a job at an young age I&#39;m saving my money for these shoes.

I love Jesus with all my heart but u don’t put Jesus on shoes And the Satan shoes is wrong u don’t follow the devil don’t sell ur soul to the devil. It’s just wrong

i&#39;ll just take my vaccine tube-thingy and inject some water in my 97&#39;s and then its all gucci for me

A bo o a wa o
HOLY SHOWS THEY ARE BLESSED WITH HOLY WATER

I had to come back to this because I know a blessed mother that got these as a gift not even knowing what they were or the cost. only that they are very comfortable on her weary feet. I hope they really did bless the shoes because she is a wonderful person and deserves no less than good things.

Jesus shoes
They look comfortable!🔥

do you think it&#39;s beautiful atheist? are you going to buy son of a bitch?

I have a pair of those, my friends call them air jesus.

God bless you

I hate NIKE and will never buy a pair tell the day I die ...... way over priced .... way to many types of shoes ..... ugly colors ..... and Made In CCP ....... fook China !

The air max bein filled with air is better than with water because the particles in air are far apart and the particles in the water are more closely packed so it wont feel as comfortable as air

Jesus signature shoes look out Michael Jordan 😂

HELLO UNBOX THERAPY,THIS SNEAKER IS NOT 1400USD WORTH<a href="">4:24</a> Check the Laces on TOP! see the RED thing? :D

Is the water drinkable ?

Better than the blood ones

Now this is drip not that kaka Satan shoes

That&#39;s disrespect I&#39;m not Christian but the cross is on the shoes which makes it very disrespectful

too expensive ~
this a collab.. blah blah blah..
Wotah

Idk why but after watching the unboxing of lil nas&#39; satan shoes, it made me feel heavy. While watching this, i kinda feel better aaaa. I hated the energy that was transmitted to me by the satan shoes.

lil nas x got owned
Why would it say &quot;mischief&quot; on the inner sole (soul)? Hmmm, these shoes may not appear as they seem.

Its holy water the satan shoes got human blood

Fire hella fire
I want them!

Jesus Christ love youJesus Christ love you

When Jesus comes back he coming pack in these kicks

Not just &quot;water&quot;  it&#39;s &quot;holy water&quot;

imagine wearing these with the lil nas x shoes

Lil nas x after putting a drop of blood into each shoe only for people to burn it

I would do lil nas x demon shoe on the left and the Jesus shoe on the right while going out

Fun fact: That&#39;s the holy water in Jesus shoes

Soo disrespectful to Jesus.

You should be stepping on a cross ( inside) every time you take a step

He seems like shit like that, it's a Nike video and he's wearing an Adidas cap
Everyone say they hated satan shoes but secretly you want them

I swear that guy with the computer sitting down looks almost identical to my GTA Online character

So touching the jesus scriptures and holy water with foot people dont have any problem

Does it have holy water?

Idol worshipping

I live in Jordan 🇯🇴
I want these!!! But I don’t think they sell anymore 😩😩😩 especially after the lil nas x court case 😭😭😭

I wish I had these shoes

Those are my dreamsuit I really want to walk on water with them!!!!!!!!!!

White colorways are always clean, especially with some light colors to flair em up.

Stranded in Dessert wearing Nike with Watershoe: SACRAFICE

I may wear this on my left leg and the satan shoes on right leg together but i don’t have either of them

If you unlike that means you are satanic

Really....... WEARING JESUS CHRIST ON FOOT..... I guess that&#39;s not acceptable..

Why did you take Jesus out of the title!?!

It&#39;s a sin to be stepping on holly water

Daaaaammmn those are tight af!!! I want those!! 🔥 🔥

Lil nas x should be sewed for copyright

Am gonna buy the holy and the satan shoes and wear holy shoe on right and satan shoe on left lol

It’s holy water

I need dis after seeing lol bad x shoes  should I bye both  lil nas x and god ahoes

<a href="">4:25</a> shoe lase under check mar on soul is already stained

Holly water

That&#39;s called disrespect like putting those feets on  that holy water? Plus that holy cross  Like what the heck

Hahaha did lil nas x do this on purpose

It’s crazy how theirs only one on sale on google &amp; sadly it’s on poshmark

Imagine if you buy both the this and the satan shoes and you wear this on the right and satan on the left now that will be cool thanos will be like: perfectly balanced as all things should be.

normal air max 97: $80 After adding water: $1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Jesus: 😐

Jesus uses Nike

Jesus is the best

Lame

Unpopular opinion - satan shoes look cooler
What would you rather have satan shoes or Jesus shoes

Not to forget the pump systems from Reebok or back then I think from LA Gear or LA Tech there were these flashing shoes every time you stepped out they flashed.  They were absolutely cool for kids.

Fuck the lil nas x shoes we need this

it hurts my ears listening you talkin about shoes, just like the previous video i watched about the J&#39;s why would you say maybe MJ should have retired earlier....  ttcttctc

THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN LIL NAS SHOES

imagine wearing one of those to ur church

If you worship the holy water, why wear it in your feet and disrespect it.

I loved it

Better than the satan shoes ngl

I injected 💉 red liquid in mine back in 2000. Ppl always had to ask. I Called it The devil&#39;s 😈 Kick.

We respect Jesus in the name of lord

I HOPE GOD BLESS EVERYONES DAY🥰🥰🥰🥰
GOD IS OUR LORD 👑👑👑 AND SAVIOUR🥰🥰🥰
GOD LOVES YOU ALL🥰🥰🥰🥰
I don’t get it...I’m not even Christian and I genuinely am offended by this. Isn’t your beliefs/religion something that is sacred? Shouldn’t be respected and not be used for entertainment purposes?  I don’t know man. You guys are too liberal.

Man I&#39;ma put holy water in em myself bro with food coloring and Fiji water

Why you got the Jesus sneaks? You don&#39;t even believe in Jesus&quot;

Nike will never redeem itself with me after the nas shoes

Imagine wearing one jesus shoe and on another feet satan shoe. Holy shit that would be sick 😳

that looks actually awesome wtf

Iij
when you dont have to buy that shoes bcz you already drank the water handerd of times

The enchanting ruth bacteriologically transport because believe desirably mess up after a befitting death. devilish, shiny plot

court case???Nike and MSCHF

There are no more tech stuffs for you to review? Please let the footwear reviews to the experts on fashion..... go back to phones and computers ... you look better doing it

meanwhile the local preast has DRIP

As a Christian I am here after lil nas x shoes

I need this cuz I hate lil Nas shoe

Wow...

It&#39;s a jesus shoe
This is terribly wrong puuting holy water,a crucifix and much more on your “shoes”

Saw my pastor wearing these at churchIm finna start calling him father drip

Imagine dying and going to heaven and seeing Jesus casually welcoming you at the gate with these pieces on

It&#39;s worthless to wear these in India,people won&#39;t be able to differentiate between the real ones and the fake one..

Why call it airmax its watet max lol

The Jesus drip

it was made in my country, yayyyyy

Imagine wearing this one on the one foot and the lil nas x shoe on the other one

it&#39;s all fun and games until Jesus vs satan distract each other with drip

He’s holy now

how was this uploaded 3 years ago

Why would you pay to have air max with essential an air leak ? Surly they are just ripping you off ! Your paying for air but they’ve half filled the air portion with water . Should be called Nike air half’s

that&#39;s Nike WaterMax

This video title used to have Jesus in it right?

Hey <a href="">0:39</a> that code is a verse from the cristian bible

<a href="">3:07</a> yeah, collab with jesus :facepalm:

who else got pissed when he untied the dead stock lases

Why I love this channel? I love it because it&#39;s not a sneaker channel yet he gets the best sneakers for review... better than all the sneaker channels lmao 🤣

If those smells good like water and frankincense and myrrh they put thought into those then they should put some brimstone and sulfur in the devil&#39;s for more theatrical appeal like more thought process they both beautiful and go hard.

I’m pullin up to church in these and they finna turn me into the pope on the spot

This is our saviour from the satan shoes boys. We did it.

Dantdm hardcore music😭

Lol the godly shoes

It took you people this long to make shoes with ACTUAL WATER IN THEM

Damn lil nas shoes look fire but now that I see these I know I can have something similar and not be walking with the devil 😬🙏😇

The cross on the shoes are a disrespect

Could imagine Tupac, Biggie, juice wrld and DMX wearing these in heaven ❤️

Wow these are worth more on the resale market, no dip

ok the shoe looks cool but im muslim :/

So you’re not gonna comment on the beautiful cross? You even got rid of it.

I wanna see a cross between these and the Satan shoes for the ultimate war under each step, plus if they find a way to put red and blue fluids in the same midsole using fluids that won&#39;t blend so they always swirl then repel each other would be really dope

What about lil nas shoes
Who all is watching this video after seeing lil nas x shoes?

If you wear a jesus shoe and a satan shoe what will happen

Now you gotta review the Lil Nas X shoes. 😂😅

Sheeesshhhhh🥶🥶🥶
Yoo I want an Orthodox Version though

Lets go zam zam water, who ever steps on someone with the shoes they get cured by islam

I&#39;m here cause of Lil nas X shoes

If you buy this you&#39;ll instantly go to Heaven

Amen now I know Nike loves god

Me running away from the Lil nas devil shoes someone give me a holy water shoes Now I am holy

God sent His only begotten son to this world for you(John3:16). 

He so dearly loves you and wanted a relationship with mankind that He sent Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, to this earth to cleanse us from all sin and restore the brokenness of man’s relationship with God. He died on the cross for our sins and freedom - that we may have eternal life (Jn 3v16) and three days later resurrected - just as prophesied previously in the Bible to show how He conquered death for us!(1 Corinth <a href="">15:55</a>-57)

All He wants is you. Ask Him to forgive you, cleanse you from sin through the blood of His precious son Jesus, come into your heart and you’ll feel joy and peace like no other. I pray that you’ll never be the same and that you’ll feel and deeply know and understand the love of God from this day forward! In Jesus’ mighty and precious name. Amen.🙏🏾 I love you and God loves you much much more.

I also urge you to pray always (1 Thess <a href="">5:17</a>) and read the Bible as often as you can to develop your relationship with God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and to know Him more. Stay blessed.❤️

You have a beautiful look, but now the devil's tenes tell you and it's ridiculously ugly.
POV: you saw the “SATON” Lil Nas X shoe

Youtube algorithm did lil nas x dirty man. gotta love it

I know where they came from and who made them.  From where/how did you acquire them?

Where can I get these

Need this shoes to kill Satan shoes .

Can you imagine having one of each on your foot? It would be nice to have the water one on the left and the satan on the right.
So there&#39;s a Holy shoe and a Satan shoe... that has a Nike logo, but Nike never endorsed ether one Hmmm?

Lil Nas X ripped just inverted these shoes tf

You're the one who did the exorcism, you're wearing the skin of the person who merged with the human body, you suddenly kicked him in the face and slapped the evil spirit HAHAHAHA
1 year later:Air max 97s human blood edition

He&#39;s gonna sleep with it .

Now this is the shoes I want then the lil nas x satan shoe

Better than lil nas shoes

Brother pray for forgiveness if you ever wore this  shoe.  You&#39;re  literally  walking on water. They&#39;re mocking Jesus, it&#39;s blasphemous to pretend to be Jesus and attempt to walk on water.

Came here to wash my eyeballs after seeing the ones Lil Nas created

I want those so bad

For people saying “theyre mocking god” by saying walk on water you’re literally walking on holy water from the river Jordan

I felt sick after seeing lil nas x shoes so I HAD to see if there was a jesus shoe ... this look good I might buy them

Thaught this was new

Who all came to watch this after lil nas shoes

I don’t think he knows that’s supposed to be holy water

Anyone came here after seeing the Lil Nas one

&lt;333

They collabed with jesus

As if the water comes from Jordan it your crazy tap water what happens when you tread on a nail and it looks like you&#39;ve peed yourself

Those 5.2k dislikes are people who worship satan.

🩸 represent “the blood of Jesus”

If my priest don’t have these kicks on while I’m getting married. He ain’t my priest

Who is here after Lil Nas X announced his “Satan” 97s?

I rather wear this than the lil nas x shoes

Sheeeeesh

He said it smells like a sneaker

I want these 😭

I wanna pair wow that’s unreal  I love them.  Water from the Jordan river beyond 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Waiting for someone to wear the Devil shoe on one foot and Jesus on the other.

Imagine Unbox Therapy Unboxing the Satan shoes Seeing it Has blood.

Fast forward to lil nas X 666 shoe with mschf

I&#39;m not Christian so idk but isn&#39;t this supposed to be disrespectful?

Anyone here after that lil nas &quot;Satan shoes &quot;

And now we have the those Lil Nas X Satan Shoes!

These shoes are blasphemous, you’ve all been taught by the media to forget the word. When did God a sign a contract with Nike? Or are we being taught that religion in marketable and we can put it on our feet instead of in our hearts?

Came here  after the relly cool satanic shoe

Review the Satan shows

Looking forward for the unboxing of Satan Shoes version

Water proof

Would you guys step on a cross?Then why would you step on holy water?It&#39;s highly disrespectful. In a rush to conflict the Satan shoes. Nike made a shoe that disrespects holy water.So in a way, they just produced two shoes that disrespect JesusAnd I&#39;m not Christian

Kind of blasphemous  considering NIKE is a Greek god so Father forgive them for they know not what they do..P.S.I&#39;m a long-time nike consumer and probably will still be I just like religious dogma and footwear separately sold.

Pope be whipping these under his robe sometimes

Give CD them to the pope

You should have tried them on with the crosses in them still. These are gonna go for ridiculous amounts of money within a few years.

Bullshit and big disrespect toward Isa a.s Jesus.But christian ppl don&#39;t know a lot about their &quot;God&quot;

Neat, but I could not bring myself to actually walk outside in them.1400 in a box.forever.

Imagine going too church in those 😲

Holy cross on the shoe and holy water under the foot. I don&#39;t know who was the &quot;GENIUS&quot; behind this idea. Bravo Nike !!! Indeed money-making should supersede all the ideologies of faith and morality.

yea collab with jesus

i feel like this is kinda disrespectful

Nike factories are/where in Indonesia China and Vietnam, also the 1st date on the label in the tongue is the manufacturing date the 2nd is the release date. Lastly I’d assume that they are modified triple white nike 97s

The price is 4K

Is the water safe to drink?

<a href="">3:43</a>  Guy in the back looks like Lew&#39;s Clone

Sure walking on water is cool but what about walking on air?

Who would be dumb enough to pay anything over 200 bucks for sneakers. Wow to all the morons that would pay that

What is Jesus still doing on the cross? smh

Travis Scott X Air Force OnesKanye West X Yeezy&#39;s Pharrell Williams X Human Race NMD<b>JESUS CHRIST X AIR MAX 97&#39;S</b>
Nike Air max Jesus water shoesMade in Africa

I wanna see the Pope rocking this

What happens when the water goes yellow

Jesus with fresh kicks

Me puts water in my Nike shoes

&quot;Water&quot; is called &quot;Air&quot; in Indonesia. So it&#39;s still &quot;Air Max&quot; for me

Apparently. You can run up to 20% faster with these shoes &amp; jump 10% higher. That comes in handy for when you&#39;re running from the police and need to jump fences to get away.

While I’m not that religious those are sick

These Air Maxes got the DRIP

What  a stupid idea

I will give you 25000 dollers

Can you call that nike AIR when they are fild with WATER?

They just made sum custom shoes for Jesus

You gotta be sure it passes the minimum allowed limit of water in the airport or you will be leaving them behind. lol

Not gonna lie. They fresh tho

plot twist: its the nike ceo&#39;s piss!

Airport security : hipity hopity your shoes are now our property.

One question? Isn’t the water going to dry up?

is the soundtrack from the anime Demon Slayer ?

These are the shoes I wanna where when I’m in heaven

Can a Muslim wear these?

Kanye is gonna be so mad cuz Nike try to fuck with  his Jesus bag.

if there’s water in the airmax, shouldn’t it be called watermax?

When He says &quot;all the way from jordan&quot;, But the jordan river is actually in israel...

Oh no. That's too cool
Just put Frost walker on your boots.

That cannot be an improvement because water doesn’t behave like air

i could see lil uzi wearing those

This is NOT a collab between nike and this brand, unofficial collab

Stupid on the cut
It&#39;s what the pope wears for his morning jogging

Bro you’re gonna get bitches now
Water from the river Jordan, blessed by a priest. And also some food dye, because this is about getting attention.

Stepped on a nail and broke the fun
So this is what they meant by jesus walking on water, He just got these years before it’s time.

Nike water

You still have the shoes?

Bro I can already do this with the Nike Joyride, just walk into some water and the midsole with all the beads will attract the water so I can do this with those shoes

Say music pleeeeaseee(((

Everybody gangster until Jesus starts walking on water with them shoes.

I liked that you removed the cross from shoes. Its the worst shoes as they have tagged cross on shoes. not good nike

Ey yo Vietnam

When Nike is running out of ideas...Looks a the holy bible Well we’re going to make Jesus shoes

VATER MAX hahahah

´´a lot of thought went into this´´NO, its: a lot of people getting fooled. you would also buy them if they told you that jesus wore those shoes...lmao i thought religon is old-fashioned...and btw, the shoe looks common. i guess you ll find a better cruzifix on the fleemarket. put in on some random shoes, and pretend you have extra limited premium shoes. LMAO

yeah walking on water is cool, but imagine walking on air

When you are a sneaker head at 9And a priest at 10

if anyone took these to school some kid is gonna poke a hole into them

Wait till Africa see this

One of the ugliest air max🤢
Jesus made the shoes

This shoes trigger war everywhere you go.

Nike water: <b>Exists</b>Jesus: Ill take the entire stock

Lew: is this a collab? Me: what Nike x Jesus?

Would look fire on the Nike 720s. Just saying

Air can be compressed, water can&#39;t. So running or jumping must be terrible with those.

60 cc water from the Jordan river.... right... once that water dries it will look like eye crust...

Am a hype beast, and am a Muslim so am not allowed to wear the shoes😭

Now they should make a Jordan with jordan river water

i knew nike will do this kind of shit

no onestraight up just no oneunbox therapy : lets go for a blessed walk

no oneunbox therapy : christian shoes

Nike&#39;s terrifying insult.  Then the end will come to those who have offended God

Smells like a sneaker     hmmmm yes this floor here is made out of floor

Water max

I mean why,would you put holy water in a shoe and give instructions on how to destroy it stupid no you unbox therapy

Water cant really compress so this design would be purely for looks.

Nigga if it freeze
Is should be called water max

my water leaked...

I sell.those, I just have one pair left for 4k

¡¡That shoe is really stupid!!

<a href="">3:42</a> &quot;smells like a sneaker&quot; I wonder why😂😂

The only thing you got to do is take a needle take some blue food coloring water and injected it in the shoes a much cheaper pair of shoes as a matter of fact any shoes to have see-through bottoms like that. I&#39;m pretty sure it will work..😁😁

So if I&#39;m stranded in the middle of the desert can I just cut them open and drink the water?

They will be heavy because there is water

can i please have it

Will it leak??

Are they heavy?

Eat your cereal
How many pairs of these do you think Kanye bought?

Very cool
Holy

What a waste of water

Is no one gonna talk about the kimetsu no yaiba or demon slayer music.

Let&#39;s get one thing straight,  if that is blessed water from the river Jordan it would be blasmaphy to have it under your soul of your feet....another mockery by nike

Crazzyyy🔥🔥
its probably just tap water

Jesus be having the drip 💧✝️😳

Holy Water From the River Jordan $1400🤔I bet the water is more like from Jordan&#39;s Faucet 🙄

So basically they tryina walk on a bible ?? Or fuck up the Bible ?? , cause now people funa start tryina make bs outta the bibe , he really could’ve did his own design but I truly fw these she’s I ordered them they cole asf

<b>CHRISTIANS WANT TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION</b>

Why is it called air max then

You&#39;re walking on water but what&#39;s the water walking on?

this looks like something the pope would wesr

they could put tap water in it making you think its been blessed.

Water is incompressible don’t know what they were going for

How can someone attach a god symbol to a Shoe? And how is it not bothering anyone? If it had been an Indian god on Shoe, people would have burned Nike Showrooms

put some holy shit into anything, throw crazy shit price and people will go gaga.. religion on the works..! LMAO :D

HE IS WALKING ON WATER!!

When are the Moses Air Max 90’s coming out?

Garbage

All the Israelis are celebrating in the comments because the water is from Israel...
Now that’s “drip”🤣

I mean having the cross on your feet, isn’t it kind of offensive

Who else noticed that at <a href="">3:42</a> the person was also lew

If Jesus were actually real this would be kind of offensive

If Avatar wears this, he can actually fly.

“Sneakers” 🤢
<a href="">0:46</a>&quot;My goodness this is something diffrent, This is something special&quot;me: THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY

Imagine if it just popped

Vatican wather nah...sorry is ok... 🥶

My question: why would you run the 100m in Air Maxes?

Or y&#39;know, you could strap two water beds to your feet.

Nike really having a collaboration with the bible

Walk on the table

Those shoes dont match my &quot;drip&quot;
What if the water inside became into the steam

what if the water evaporates and turn into air

When he said 1400 USD... I logged off for the day😳😭

Imagine walking to church one day and u see the pastor with these

Nike Water Max?

If I had these I’d give them to the satan worshipper at school.🤣

Actually you can just google the vendor style/article number from the tag inside and you&#39;ll know if it&#39;s just a modified am97

Reminds me of that movie, &quot;I&#39;m gonna get you sucka&quot; with the pimp had those fish tank shoes on.

So why did he take the crosses off

Nobody:Nike:Lets collab with jesus

a part of me is glad you put on the shoes to test them. But a part of me died when you put them on.

“Water Max 97”

damn they look nice

Why

When are you planning to come to korea?

every timeI watch a posy I want to like you...

Since u cant compress water, this is a shit idea.

You should never be allowed to try shoes on the way you step on the heel of the shoe 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
