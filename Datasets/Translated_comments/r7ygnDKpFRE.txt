This video is before MKBHD top Notch puns were a thing 

thats the iphone x :(

I love how wrong they were

I literally just  REplayed ALL your videos looking for THIS ONE SONG!

This guy had the iphone X in his hands before the iphone 8 came out? Top tier

AAAAAAAnd that’s exactly what it looked like

I love that he hasn’t change the title after the name was revealed as “X”!

2021 

watching this in 2021 lmao

Little did he know this would be iPhone X

crazy looking at this after it was released, basically the 8 was just model pushed out to give them more time to finish up and tweak the x

<a href="">2:51</a> Is the snake real?

Iphone x supposed to be the iphone 8.And 8 and 8+ should be the iphone 7S and 7S plus. They just changed the name of their products

its funny watching this in 2020

Im watching this in 2020 August 11

Wow, I&#39;m surprised at how close they got. I mean, obviously not the same name, but still....

Lol iphone 10 xdd

2020

Fake is iPhone X

this model is better than iphone x

when you know its the  iPhone X‍️‍️‍️
When a clone has thinner besels than a real one 

Watching on my iPhone 11

&quot;Top sensoe pertrution&quot; lol, it&#39;s funny how it&#39;s so common these days thay people have a name for it now.

Drunken girl fucked streeper
I’m just the newest comment lol

I wish the iPhone 8 looked like that!Also they predicted the future of the iPhone X 

Iphone x lmao

dude he literally leaked the iphone x before iphone 8

Damn this just goes to show that apple wanted to come out with the iphone x model a lot earlier

Boy were they wrong!

Um it the iPhone X

Funny watching this in 2019...

Okay, couple number of iPhone numbers off, but you&#39;re good

That is A iPhone x

Throwback to when MKBHD nailed the iPhone X design thinking it was the iPhone 8

vabeo

We call it notch these days.

X*

Fake iPhone x worth $50

That dummy iphone x worth $50

My mom has an iPhoneXR and my dad has an iPhoneXS MAX

Who&#39;s here after the iPhone Xs and Xr are out?

<b>COUGH</b> I PHONE X NOT 8 <b>COUGH</b>

Who’s watching this right before the 3 new 2018 iPhones release 

say deceived yeet
Hey

iPhone X*

Quite similar

Back then everyone said this phone looked ugly as fuck, now they&#39;re saying it has the best design 

Please give me a iPhone x giveaway please,please

This iphone x now. So maybe you can make many of the and sell them as clones. You know

This is so funny because everyone saying this is ugly but this was the I phone 10

Give link to buy

lol dats iPhone X
Where i can buy that model

This is X, not 8

boy were they wrong!

X

this device and brand are overrated and overpriced. I love my lenovo vibe k6 plus, it is a deadly cheap device compared to this, it doesn&#39;t have all the features, but why would bother having a smartphone better than a device tha has already digital recognition, hd recording, 16Mega pixels gesture recognition... and everything else for 1/6 if the iphones price? Screw Apple, seriously!

Spoilers It&#39;s Iphone X

I saw a figdet spinner
I&#39;m confused between iPhone 8 and Samsung s8. Could someone please tell me the battery life of an iPhone 8

You mean X?

How come wireless charging does not work with the metal back but only on the glass back?

This Iphone X

HE IS LITERALLY JUST HOLDING THE IPHONE X

Well we now know it has a black bezel

Looks so much like the actual x

iPhone X Anyone?

Fake dude
This looks pretty good !!

O:

Why did people think the iPhone 8 was going to be the iPhone X

Here now in December 2017, damn, this wasn&#39;t all that off besides the name haha

Best phone hands down
ehm sir thats the iphone X

Who else cringes when he calls the iPhone X the iPhone 8

Funny how we all thought it was 8

Iphone x is my bedroom

Did the iPhone 4s not have a glass back back in the day? I just remember the trend of putting highlighter ink in the back when your phone smashed lol

This ugly

I like iphones iPhone is top

the iPhone X doesn&#39;t even support hi-speed wireless charging; still years behind Samsung

Shakka-say nada
Do you think my iPhone X can recognize my face in theater  or in dark places  or how about eyes contact ...

Fuck you iPhone 8

The iPhone 8 is black.
iPhone
Watching this video after the official launch feels a bit weird..

1334x750 display? LOL

Phones shit. Bye Apple hello android!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I Used Clips from this Video in my video. Don&#39;t Worry I Gave Credit. Thanks for being a big inspiration for me.

Later, apple will launch invisible iphone.

Holy shit, this was spot on.

I&#39;m just waiting for TechRax to Destroy this Phone 

Steve jobs would never have let this happen to iPhone.

Was that a real snake?

Seriously the design is ugly

When it was actually the real thing...

&gt;still no aux portwhats the point

OLED...screen...Samsung has been using this for years, Samsung is already on AMOLED................come on Apple!

air power is copy again but not even available until NEXT YEAR...................YEAH ?

Hey @MarquessBrownlee !!Can&#39;t wait to watch your video on iPhone 8 and iPhone X !!!If you start iPhone 8 or iPhone X give away, please do consider me !!                                       -Your huge fan

Perfect match 
the video actually predicted the iphone x..

That&#39;s the concept? It&#39;s always not right

Jokes on you¡!!!!!!!!!!!!

Too bad it&#39;s the same damn thing as last time

Keep on Dreaming :D

Nice fake leak man

It looks like a I phone 4

I love the new look! If I knew this was going to be the new design I would have thought twice about buying the Oneplus 5.

totaly awful...

Can anyone tell me where is the fingerprint sensor in iphone 8

Man.. This iphone looks like every other girl from a far distant.. So sexy.. When you turn around.. Damn.. I can spell it all over.. U G L Y!

<b>well, why buy a new one?</b>
Amazing Video of Apple iphone 8. Good Luck for your future my dear.

it's funny
How will facial recognition work in the dark?may be infrared !!!hmm to be frank looks kind of like LG Q6

<b>Ugly AF</b>

This js the first time I have to agree with those people who are calling iPhone UGLY.

Lmfaooooo, I&#39;m done apple made a fucking Samsung phone
awesome video...sir

If this is what the iPhone will look like then it&#39;s over for Apple.

End of Apple

Looks ugly , a black front may give it a better look. S8 looks better. If they want to use plastic back then s8 OR iPhone - feel will be same

iPhone 8 very ugly Don't let me know, Turks, where are you?🇹🇷
Woow 

faith ahead teacher throat amid evolution increased blood.

OMG! even a prototype model looks excellent the design of the phone. am expecting more from apple, will be more better then the prototype he just reviewed.tho i&#39;ll miss the Home button.

iphone copies galaxy series.

Looks like the Droid RAZR M from a few years ago

the camera bump..humm no one can solve that problem!

That so ugly ......
Why apple logo can&#39;t be a fingerprint sensor?

if ever that is going to be the design of the real iPhone, then fuck them the front is decent but that camera placement is so shitty! It would look 10 times better if they kept it horizontal!

You have so many view all your videos are over a mil or reaching 1 mil

Did he forget that the iPhone 4 also had a glass back?

Cream routine decrease wcfrap frame response public slide nearly bottom honest identify.

That ugly as hell

its like a iphone 4s x samsung galaxy s8 . very ugly apple , verrrry ugly

No Finger Print Sensor
This looks too ugly ......!!!!!!

This is basically a failed Essential phone

If it has white bezels, I am actually gonna kms

I suspect that the iPhone will have this look with a camera a speaker bar at the top as a branding feature. Like, everyone can identify iPhones due to their round button at the bottom, even if used briefly in movies, etc. With the home button gone, I guess Apple needs a way of making a frontal statement in the phone, otherwise it would be just a generic piece of glass. Brands don&#39;t like generic.

I actually like the white bezel and the top cutout makes it unique.. at first it looks weird but its growing on me. At least it would look different from the whole screen thing every manufacturer is trying to do.

Seriously folks...what is left in phone development??  Nothing really exciting is coming out now....we have now reached the limit of size and slimness...so now what?  What will be the new thing?  I see nothing new and exciting on offer?

Steve Jobs would be so depressed with the progress Apple has made...

new design sucks
Are they going to announce iphone 7s and 7s Plus or this iphone 8?

It really looks ugly

Apple still haven&#39;t fix the budging camera. Hope the iphone 8 sales drop will change their opinion.

Guys chill, it’s a dummy model. Not a $1000 dollar model made by apple

What happened to the edge-to-edge display? I keep seeing these &#39;dummy units&#39; that look awful AND have narrow bezels on all sides! This would really disappoint a lot of people - including me.

iPhones are just getting uglier and uglier... Never been much of in Apple guy, but I really prefer the design of the iPhone 5, it just felt way more solid and sturdy

THE CAMERA LOOKS LIKE A TRAFFIC SIGNAL !!!

Hey Marques, this Everything Apple Pro guy releases a video every 10 minutes. It&#39;s just a rehash of every rumor he can find. I absolutely hate watching this guy and won&#39;t watch his videos anymore. He is Mr. Click Bait. Your videos have more substance and I enjoy watching you.

This is just like an Android phone BTW I think this is a proto type

iphone 8 looks horrible..
Just found out my job&#39;s giving me the new iPhone 8... I&#39;ve never used an apple product before... figured I&#39;d learn about it here. Currently using a Pixel XL.

THE SCREEN IS FUCING UGLY!!!!

damn...its ugly af

the reason why i dont go android is because of the way their cameras look. The camera on this looks absolute shit

Nice..Phone

Shit Ugly look i phone 8

How would one get there hands on one of these dummy phones?

iphone 8 leaked by apple employee,check my channel video is for limited period, it might get deleted

its not pretty

Samsung S8 design is 100x better than this shit!

theres no way they would release something that ugly

Nice iPhone 8
Apple:a new year Samsung you can’t copy my model iPhone just use your weird vertical screen I don’t need it Samsung:Apple you know what your iPhone 8 has a traffic light camera you should shame about itApple:excuse me your Samsung note 8 has a robot eye camera Samsung:well it’s more better than you,just see who got lot sell of this year 

That is one ugly ass phone with that cheesy white bezel looking like a play phone

HeheLolYuck
Brother, that&#39;s one ugly-ass phone.

Yo is that a real python?!

Nice looking Android Phone Wow
I will seriously laugh my butt off if the iPhone 8 looks just like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus model (the camera location is the same) and the only difference is that there is a full touch screen with the home button on the screen and the finger Touch ID is on the back...and wireless charging (but the charging pad is sold separately)....all for a whooping $1,000.00. And let&#39;s not forget the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus models will just have wireless charging. Hmmm....maybe I&#39;m wrong but if the iPhone 8 will look like the dummy version in the video than I&#39;ll just hang on to my iPhone 7 Plus until Apple no longer supports the software for it....which will probably be when iOS 15 comes out LOLOL =D

im gonna be so honest but thats ugly

i love apple but shit that looks terrible so far the galaxy s8 looks the best but my issue with that is the phone isn&#39;t wide enough.

This can be the iPhone 8 .Because should you have an iphone and we not ?

..ssheeeeitttt! ..if apple keeps this up... i might have to switch to that bad boy!..shoutout to that shakka tune by the way !!

The bezels look ugly

Looks like a bootleg samsung

what about the home button????!!!!

Make bezels black on all the models and IM INN BABY

I don't get it but it's cool.
Fuck this I would buy iPhone 7 plus then this shit

We all know it&#39;s not gonna look like that

I think this is really ugly.

Apple or Samsung, Reply down below!

I was hoping for a better design =( . I guess I&#39;ll have to wait for the iPhone 10 lol!

ugly..
god it&#39;s ugly

what a price bro

I don&#39;t like how the screen is narrower

It looks shit. I hope that&#39;s not how it ends up looking.

Whoever thinks new iPhone will look like this one in the video, doesnt&#39; know anything about Apple.

Ofcourse infinite display like samsung
sensor bump, and camera bump and this is going to be 1k $.

Looks like a samsung tbh
Looks like a child&#39;s phone.
i started missing iPhone 3GS while watching this shitty stuff :))

Looks like if Samsung and Apple had a baby.But it had autism

It&#39;s looks like a shit

Hmmm . I don&#39;t sure the new iPhone 8 in 2017. But I think it in 2018.   --<i>_(       )__</i>--

Hmmm . I don&#39;t sure the new iPhone 8 in 2017. But I think it in 2018.   --<i>_(       )__</i>--

1k for a iPhone???? 

That phone looks retarded

Nope, I wouldn&#39;t buy it if it comes out looking like what you just shown us.

Looks ugly ..get s8 or v30

looks weird

Do people not like the edge to edge display or something? I&#39;m an android user, but I think it&#39;s awesome - been waiting for Apple to put something out like this for ages.

The camera is not in the middle.I don&#39;t like the look.

I hope this is what the phone actually looks like. Absolutely hideous

So how many colors does the IPhone8 have？

Looks like trash 
i&#39;m sure the black model will look better. the frame is weird in white

After spending a premium on a 3 version older device, I hopefully will be able to get it in 2020!!! :-)

The only thing developers should care right now is battery life, and iPhone does great in this part, got Samsung galaxy 8 and battery life sucks hard.

Samsung fanboys be like &quot; what a bunch of f&#39;n copycats!! &quot;

How we gonna unlock our iphone in a dark room . 
those white bezel is UGLY!

How can I get iPhone 8???

Looks like trash i am fucking disappointed in apple

ugly..
ok wtf with the back camera? oh my gosh, I will not buy it if it looks like a horror iphone

Irrelevant, but I got so hyped when I heard &#39;Say Nada&#39; start playing

But the hat is new.
Tbh, i love this phone. Not the white front, the black front. I really want to buy it it‘s so beautiful to me. Damn apple

Ugh. Not too much of the fan with the look.

I can see you are too biased towards iPhone 

Wasting time with a fidget spinner....

Isn't it Antenna Picto iOS 11?
Lol

i swear to god if they say this phone is the first phone with a thin display.

I don&#39;t think anyone is willing to pay 1,000 dollars for an iPhone.

Im using a iphone 7 right now and i think im not gonna upgrade. I was thinking bout it but this new iphone doesnt worth to my money. Damn it looks like 100 dolar android phone. Where is the metal back? Where is that luxurios iphone 8 ? If they start to sell it, apple will fail for %100.

IT&#39;S UGLY!!!!

Lol snapple

ugly AF

think ill just buy an iphone 6 outright instead of upgrading to this lol

Apple have great products! BUT..  Apple seriously? is this &quot;The Future&quot;  with that traffic light camera? other than that it&#39;s fantastic!

i was about to switch from android to iphone just because of imessage but now im like nah this phone is ugly as shit. the only thing apple has going for them is imessage and facetime. take away those two and youve got a average phone that is way overpriced. androids still blow this thing out of the water.

Camera looks ugly
Dude they basically brought back the best iPhone look from 4th generation... Awesome ! Too bad I&#39;m already deep into Android

Honestly, I&#39;ve had an iPhone for years, but holy shit, it&#39;s ugly as sin!

The iPhone 8 looks ugly as f**k

The front bezels drive me nuts ugh

It almost looks like an HTC

Fuck that, I just want the 5s design back.

UUUuuuuglinesss!
It looks super nice with all that screen!

Ballpython !
And here I am with my Alcatel one touch PIxi 4

Ugly !!! Come on MK don&#39;t be scared to say it

That looks ugly. Sorry.

Iphone 4/4s had glass backs. Surprised you didn&#39;t even mention that

Worried shock across pose doctrine writer.

Looks like an ugly android phone.

I&#39;m still waiting for the iPhone to catch up with my old Galaxy S5, never mind my new S8!  Ultra-Display, 4K recording, microSD support....

Those vertical dual camera is major turn off for me

No fingerprint ? now Facial Scanner will be easy to break I mean someone picks up my phone and Unlock it by simply facing it toward my face while in case of fingerprint i feel more secure

you have uchiha itachi&#39;s under eye lines

Lol everyone was complaining how apple phones looked outdated with the home button and big bezels but once they fix it you complain about it looking ugly and like an android?? Alright mate

ugly design

Jesus is King! &lt;3

Not good. People likes the home button which also works as finger print scanner. That&#39;s kind of the identity of an Iphone. But they removed it. So it&#39;s not iPhone anymore. It&#39;s another phone made by apple. 

Lol S8 and Note8 soo much better.....

I&#39;m an android user and always will be

Looks like a cheap asian phone..
Where the home button tho

Am i the only one that loves both android and apple? I love fucking up my phone with all the customization on android though lol

Every year I say that I&#39;m not going to buy the new iPhone before the official announcement...then every year I upgrade to the newest iPhone as soon as it becomes available. I give up, I surrender, I know that I&#39;ll be buying it as soon as preorders are being taken. Yes, I admit it...I&#39;m a complete Apple sheep.

Just get the LG G6, it looks exactly the same as this... but better made.

It doesn&#39;t look too bad. They are bringing back design elements from the old iPhone 4 combined with the iPhone 7. I don&#39;t really like that screen cut out on the top though.

Wtf was the point of the iPhone 7 it shouldn&#39;t even exist

please get the fidget spinner out of the shot

Why can&#39;t Apple just use their logo at the back for the fingerprint lock?

where is the home button what do u do??

Samsung s8 is better.

Why are we blind to the fact that mobile technology has been and still is really dry. Give us something innovative!

Will there be a headphone jack or will it still be an unusable piece of shit?

Cool you got a ball python

A Snake on The Table!!!

That phone cost 1000$, these iphones be coming out way too fast and way too much. I&#39;m good with my iPhone 6 Plus, I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all

Looks shit tbh

What kind of design is this 

If the end product honestly looks like that I&#39;m not buying it&#39;s ghastly

Are they coming out with a iPhone 8 plus?

Does anyone else not like the design of the iPhone 8?

Just a note. The iPhone 4 had a glass back. Do you think no one remembers?

i really appreciated all the cool background props haha

UGLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!

The white frame around the screen is awful looking..

To all those saying how ugly it is etc, just remember that when the iPhone 6 was announced everyone said the same thing, purely because the design deviated from what was custom at that point. Also, this is just a concept still, no one truly knows until it&#39;s released.

new cam is whack

Ugly

The iPhone 8 will be my first IPhone, will you do a tutorial for  it, me, us? And how do I add my picture to this thing.

Guys, its just a phone.

Shit,..I never knew i would say this ...but that shit looks UGLY.!

you know what apple business strategy is? &quot;Not first but BEST&quot;

Does anyone else think it doesn&#39;t really look like an apple product? (I know it&#39;s a leaked based model or whatever, but still)

Still, I rather just continue rocking my S7. Why buy an s8 or note 8 or an iPhone 8, when you can just by the s7? which is equally as good as the others, but yet cheaper.

Damn that thing is uuuugly

I think the black model with a black themed wallpaper on the phone would make it look amazing

Looking so poor i7 is pretty good

So ugly
still a little curious to know what will the so called &quot;gate&quot; be this time..

Is that a Ball python u got?

got stuff¿???????¿
I want iPhone8
Very disappointed with the new design, it kinda look old....nothing new....

Home button?

Apple removes the Fingerprint scanner for:OLED display, Wireless charging, Small bezels, Power button(like Sony&#39;s smartphones) Facial Recognition.I say it&#39;s worth it :p

Sorry. Looks cheap.
Iphones are going worse

The intro music is trash my dude

Open the IPhone 8 and put the iPhone 7 system

I really want an IPhone but if it&#39;s looking like that then Samsung for me.

well thats certainly a different design than what i was expecting from Apple, i thought they would go back to their roots with the design, but it makes sense to adopt a trend and perfect it, that is basically Apple&#39;s motto. that being said, no fingerprint sensor would be a bad idea imo. would the face scanner work in the dark? why not make the apple logo on the back a sensor? that would be classy and functional. unless they are doing it for security reasons, then i would definitely understand since fingerprints are considered evidence.

And people still said Samsung is copying Apple design

Where did you get it?

it look like a android in front view lol

Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8 battle whos gonna win?

Just get a galaxy same thing

Ugliest design made by apple!!gonna buy ip7+ instead

Wow. Rectangular and a screen ....wow. Just wow.

i currently own an s8 but i think i will switch to the iphone 8 (not 100% sure because it is not the finished product so i will decide then) and for anyone apple vs android tbh i don&#39;t even care anymore it&#39;s both operating system are nice and i personally like the iphone&#39;s &quot;simple&quot; design (my opinion don&#39;t rant)

I&#39;m on the annual upgrade plan so I&#39;m getting a new one regardless.  I love the fact that i&#39;ll be just slightly bigger than the 7, but with the same screen real estate as the Plus. Can&#39;t wait to get one.

Hey...how come in the bit with the screen on part it still uses the dots for the signal strength bars?

Marques using that shakka in the intro, I like that

The screen size includes the portion that is the earpiece and the cam? The earpiece in the middle seems to take away from the screen size.  Watching something in the iPhone 8 will be smaller since it&#39;s not going to wrap video around the earpeice.

wait for iphone 8 guys
i want iphone 9

Thank you so much for not making every video 10 minutes long.

The camera on the back looks stupid af. I liked how they put it horizontal in the last iphone. Where is that iphone 7s?

And Finally .....looks like a Android!!!!... lol

i actually find the front pretty ugly ..

samsung is king...

looks ugly af

It&#39;s humiliating and ridiculous that iphone anniversary model have some issues with this or that peoples paying 1000s of pounds or dollars and theses idiots instead of be prepared they doing everything in rush in last moments. It&#39;s really not funny, they doing idiots from the peoples which are waiting for something amazing and here we getting again some quickly constructed sh....t. That&#39;s how i feel, they lost respect in my eyes and I&#39;m a big fan of iphone, but limit of my patience gone. I will not buy iphone in this year because i will not let them cover my eyes by releasing something which imitate iphone 8. Count how much profit they will get from selling new iphone and ask yourself, do we should worry something about or we should get that what we deserve for by staying loyal to them products.... we shouldn&#39;t think even, do we will be able to buy the iphone after will be released? It will be free from any construction defects? Should be fully tested and ready long time ago because it&#39;s 10th anniversary fuc.... elllll!!!!!!! What they think they are? It&#39;s just a F Phone

Wow that a nice model of Iphone8

Fake video

What&#39;s next apple,u gonna take away the goddamn home button?

I rather wait for the note 9

The camera layout of the iphone 8 kind of looks like a vertical LG G5 camera layout

Holy fuck I have urges to hold one of those models....

Im just just watching these comments crying and laughing. Like i like Apple and Samsung. I find it funny and sad that is everyone fucking crying like 9 year old kids that dont like the new i phone. Who fucking cares, thats a fucking Phone! Care about the real things in life pls. And i know my english is shit and i dont care about grammatic.

You need to improve your motion tracking. Use a plugin for Ae. Cuz the &quot;3D camera tracker&quot; is shit

Glass Getting closer to the corners? Yes, that has been the case for a few years, and yes that&#39;s a problem.

I&#39;m currently really happy with my iPhone SE. I also liked the iPhone 4 I owned before this. I use an iPad and a Macbook as well. Apple really knows how to make really good products.

THE NEO-GEO IS WAY BETTER THAN THE XBOX X(for its time)

Looks ugly

I like it

Lit

Now, I love iPhones and I am an &quot;Apple fan boy&quot; myself.... but that is one ugly ass phone!!!

this is one gorgeous phone, well done apple.

Wait woah what happened to the home button... probably won&#39;t even get a virtual key. iPhone 7 and 7 plus no head phone jack. iPhone 8 no home button. iPhone 9 no anything at all, you just pay Apple cause you can 

I like the iphone but ur better off with a samsung or LG i hope samsung has promotion with Sprint

I&#39;d rather have a full metal back than wireless charging through glass.

Since when is having small bezels copying android phones?  you guys are so extra lmao

The white version is uglyI like the black version

iPhone shit , Samsung Shit . Just buy Asus Zenfone its cheap and strong !

Firstly ,they should try to keep the sar value low 

They copied galaxy s8 infinity screen

fake

Am I the only one who think it&#39;s an ugly phone?  hopefully  the real i phone 8 is diffrent

money scan responsible southwest white pump jail baseball pressure.

idumb

Galaxy looks shit and very cheap beside iPhone prototype. iPhone rules. Greatness.

&quot;You have bug eyes&quot;.

Give me one please Iphone 8

Dang, it is ugly to put out front sensors like that

I like android more but I really like the style of the new iPhone :)

This iPhone will be quite ugly from the front side. I think the display around the front camera.

Iphone 8 with the bezelless display still has fat bezels...

iphone 8 is gay

Is there a headphone jack?

Which fidget spinner you have

iphone is so fucking gay lol

I&#39;ll stick to my OnePlus 3T....way better than this. Period.

99% off the comments are people that hate Apple and go to every video involving the iPhone 8 and talking trash.

ugly ass phone

Glass back. Yep that&#39;ll break easily.

I&#39;ve been waiting for this phone for longer than a year and I hate the design. I actually love the iPhone plus size.

looks like that new &quot;essential&quot; phone brand

I&#39;d rock that iPhone 8 can&#39;t wait to see and work with it

iPhone 8 fake from China lol

Your videos are great. Keep up the great work!

Yeah. I think so 

What fidjet spinner u r using

Iphones are better than samsung phones...SH*T I DON&#39;T HAVE POP CORN!!!!

Ugliest phone ever im not buying that shit

I don&#39;t really see the point of upgrading your phone since every year they come out with a new one anyways. Still on my 3g.

Stoplight

Just buy the oneplus 5, it has 8 gigs of ram.

Marques fam.see you jamming with BBK.  proper lit bruv.

So ugly, why didn’t God take away Cook?
why does the essential phone have no camera bump but Apple can&#39;t flatten the iPhones bump??

The iphone 8 looks too cheap compared to the 7

I dont think thats the design for iphone 8. Apple leaked the blueprint for all the major companies who makes accessories and want them to make accessories for iphone accessories. End of the day when they will release the iphone 8 you dont have anything to buy. You must buy all the accessories from apple. Thats my point of view. 

looks like a 2013/14 HTC phone.

Is that a banana?

ill stick with my Nokia 1100

Shittttt there&#39;s a war between apple users and android user LOL How to start a war: android is a piece of shit, apple is better. This is a joke they are both pretty good.

I love my s7

Looks like an old samsung

Whoa am waiting for IPhone 9

eesh not feeling that design or the glass finish being back, glass is a fingerprint magnet

Still look the same as all the other iPhones  smh... I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s innovative... finger print scanner, iris scanner... only now there doing that... Samsung&#39;s been doing that for awhile already

Looks like shit

don&#39;t know how I feel about the design , Its not pretty , but its not ugly, hmmm....

fuck android i want this iphone

this can&#39;t be how it will actually look that thing is ugly af

Samzung looks so ugly, still buying it even it explodes..how silly samzung fans.

Apple 2016 - 5.5 inch normal fat ass phone...Apple 2017 - 5.5 inch normal fat ass phone part 2...
BRACE YOURSELF!! THE iSHEEP ARE COMING!!!

S8. Period.

I still have iPhone 5 and here Apple making iPhone 8-_-

Hi isheeps, just came here to say that s8(plus)/note 8 is far better than this junk. Let the salt begin. <b>grabs popcorn</b>

I&#39;ll wait until I here it from Apple...

I highly doubt that top sensor bar is going to be covering up any portion of the screen like that. More likely the screen will end before that sensor bar begins. Otherwise all apps are going to be a pain in the butt to look at.

The iPhone didn&#39;t always have a metal back up until now, the 4 and 4s had glass backs.

Samsung&#39;s better~
Who uses an iPhone anyway?

With the removal of the chin I wonder how hard it&#39;s going to be to reach the bottom row of main apps

I wanna boop that snek.

Yeah this is the real iPhone 8

So Apple copies the Essential Phone design and no one says anything! If it was Samsung doing it people would say how unnoriginal

Never been this happy about why I always choose samsung instead of apple.

I think iPhone4 is best.

wheres the home button??

Why tf is icrap tryna copy Sam and look at the iPhone 9s and the galaxy s8

I was ready to buy galaxy. But after the despicable PC sjw act by Google. I have to buy iPhone

Fuck that Technology demo! that snake was alive!!!!

SAMSUNG NOTE 8 AND SAMSUNG S8 
Next time, I will definitely buy a Samsung phone.
I&#39;ll stick with my 3 year old iPhone 6 -.-

Really had to get the fidget spinner in the shot huh.. Lol

This phone is ugly as shit and I would rather have the s8 (I am a fan of apple literally typing this on the SE)

Idk what&#39;s the obsession with iphones, they look like toys, and the specs are nothing impressive, if you call yourself a tech head and you&#39;re stanning for iphones so hard no matter the quality...Sumn is off. I feel it&#39;s so popular because there was a time when it was the most innovative and became mainstream and then it became a status symbol it&#39;s like if u don&#39;t have an iPhone you&#39;re automatically broke, but given the amount of broke people I see with iphones...hmmm. stupidity.

Am I the only one who noticed the snake in the shelf? Haha

Did you pay for that Shakka intro?

I just came here after watching the Note 8 trailer. I couldnt stop laughing. What an ugly fucking phone this is in comparison

Have fun with your new iPhone, its a Galaxy S8 Great Value Edition lol!

Apple users must love that camera bump while using this phone on flat surfaces.

What if u have a twin?...

Very ugly old design is better

Apple is turning into fucking Samsung, there phones are getting shitty now...

Watching on iPhone 4s

ugly
it does looks like LG G6 ! ,
innovative, creative, and primitive

I&#39;m not any sort of apple fanboy at all. But I started to kinda love apple when I first saw the 7 plus. And I think I&#39;m never gonna like or want to get hands on that 8 model. For my own reasons, I don&#39;t like it.

Is this has fingerprint scannor?

Glowing logo is available on i8 or it is same as i7

the mighty Apple is playing catch up

ugly phone yuk

No. That doesn&#39;t look very attractive at all. Just. No.

I&#39;m so glad to see a str8 guy with nice clean nice looking hands! Lol!

Apple, helping idiots who are technologically impaired look &quot;smart&quot;

Lmao people fighting in the comment section over a cell phone. Get over yourself already, apple with their expensive products and shitty hardware has so many of you brainwashed. Get over yourselves already, just look at the specs in their products.Example: *shitty ass car that&#39;s worth nothing and doesn&#39;t start*: $0*shitty ass car that&#39;s worth nothing and doesn&#39;t start but has the apple logo*: $10,000+

That looks like a Motorola  and the dual lens in the front, that&#39;s what Oppo is doing. And yeah where is the touch ID?? Are we gonna see facial recognition?

This phone would look so much better with less of bezels on the sides, now it reminds more of an essential phone. And that dual camera placement is the ugliest I&#39;ve ever seen, camera bump makes it look even worse.

I AM AN IOS USER OF 6 YEARS BUT I WANT A GALAXY S8. TELL ME WHY I SHOULD STAY WITH IOS

butthurt samsung fans in the comments

LMFAO all the Apple Fanboys be like &quot;it&#39;s ugly as shit!!! Don&#39;t do it Apple&quot; and it&#39;s the first iPhone in a Decade that doesn&#39;t &quot;look like an iPhone&quot;. These fucking snowflakes actually DONT want the phone to look different and they are why it hasn&#39;t in 10 years. Cuz they are conditioned by Apple to want, in fact need, the same phone every year thus making damn sure Apple still reaps billion in profits WITHOUT actually doing anything remotely different. Now? They actually change something and everyone is losing their minds. I laugh from my Pixel in Quite Black (blatantly making fun of Apple). From this Ivory Tower, I see a lot of cockroaches with Apple logos running around like they&#39;re on fire and it&#39;s AWESOME LMFAO

OMFG ITS GORGEOUS

Apple : no more back glassSamsung : added back glassApple : fuck , let me go back to back glassSamsung : no more back glassApple : UuUUuuhhhhh !!!
Hey, I&#39;m an Apple dude, but I freaking hate the look of this phone so far, hoping that apple changes the borders and edges...

Drops it, breaks in half

I&#39;ve been missing the glass back since iphone 4s

Let&#39;s face it, apple has completely lost it&#39;s design. But I mean I guess things change. ;/

Yeah looks pretty... Ugly af. Why Apple why?

your videos look insane on my 4K TV

No average Joe is paying $1,000 for an phone though

is it bad that I only have a flipphone? (It&#39;s better than nothing), I usually see kids after school while waiting to get picked up, which their like 7 years old and im in 5th grade and there holding a iphone 7 being all sassy and stuff, what has this world become?

That snake gotta go, lol.

You  stupid ass idiots....stop saying that Samsung is better just cause it&#39;s cheaper,because to tell the the truth..deep deep inside you guys want the iphone

The beauty if iphone is whenevr i use other andorindi my minds says shall i chnage my phone but when i use my ohine again my mind says you have the best theb why do you need better,haters may comebt anything but a iphone is iphone only a true fan knows

I hate the design it will look like the cheap smasung s8,wil lstick with ip7 i think the such design is not necessary for iPhone when it sells like a hot cake.

Daaamn... Look at that nice piece of smartphone ass next to the shitty iPhone. The Samsung looks cgi good.

Iphone 8 is like the old samsung galaxy s

Mkbhd tailosive tech and everything  pro are beastssss

Soooooooooooooooooooo ugly . . .Realy realy ugly

This looks mad ugly for me, no offense to those people who love the design.

a like for that cutie little snake! &lt;3

The ICrackInYourAssCheeks

I phone prices are very high the first year .but after a few months the price becomes half..that shows how cheap actually apple is.whereas Samsungs price never goes down.. cuz it&#39;s expensive not like apple

That is no more innovation phone

I don&#39;t like the chrome bezel... I don&#39;t like the fact of the phones bigger phones keep getting bigger and bigger phones how do you fit it in your pocket.  4.7 inch display is perfect if they could shrink the body to fit 4.7 display

Am I the only one that is not digging this design? The sensor bar makes it look awful to me.  Im both an Android user and apple user but for some reason I think earlier iPhone models look better. I suppose its the sacrifice for more screen real estate.

This shit is fragile af you&#39;d definitely need insurance on it

Apple please don&#39;t copy android do what&#39;s been working

The iPhone 8 is ugly...

Is it just me or does the iphone model look like an android!!?!?!!

Why not just have the fingerprint reader on the back similar to what the pixel have? In regards to the home button, why not just do you what android does and use a digital home button?

Is 3D facial recognition going to let me unlock my phone if I wake up in the middle of the night ? Wouldn&#39;t it need extra light from the phone screen? If so, that&#39;s not gonna work because my spouse is a light sleeper and I have to keep the phone on the lowest setting so as not to wake her up.

Doesn&#39;t iPhone 7S come out first.

This rumor about face recognition is not practical, how are you going to pay with the phone?  put it in front of you and then pay?!

Depending on the price and availability, I will either get the iPhone 8 or 7s. It will be easier to connect to my Mac, and it will last longer, which matters a lot because I don&#39;t change my phone very often. This is personal taste, but I prefer the iOS to other phones&#39; because it is cleaner, smoother, and there are some iOS-specific apps that I would like to be able to use. Also, despite better specs on paper I was surprised to see the iPhone 7 still beat the Galaxy S8 in a couple speed tests. One thing that I disagree with is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, because currently the sound quality of bluetooth isn&#39;t as good as analogue,  however since I listen to music on an iPod I won&#39;t need to use headphones with the phone much anyway.I&#39;ve resisted getting a nice phone for years now, but it&#39;s become increasingly difficult for me to live without one considering how app/phone reliant society has become.

Tbh it ain&#39;t even ugly. But when I upgrade from my 7 next year I&#39;m just gonna get the 7 plus I&#39;m not wasting more money it&#39;ll be cheaper by next august while the 8 won&#39;t ‍️don&#39;t wanna be that broke

iPhone 8 or Samsung galaxy S8 Plus ?
1 word fuck samsung. Oh shit thats 2 words xD

that shit look like my old nokia windows 8 phone...

Sweet uncle 
Hello, i like your videos
It&#39;s upsetting that apple has took away the headphone jack because not many people can afford to buy air pods etc

I just can&#39;t see Apple doing that sensor bezel at the top like that... I don&#39;t know anything about the rumours so that might be set in stone but if they do go for that the S8 will still look a lot slicker in design. If they do the bezel I think it will be in black to match the display when it&#39;s off, even on the different colour options.

And to answer the Q: Hell nah.

I&#39;m love in

That is NOT edge-to-edge......

Say no, nothing Na Na Na
why does it look like my old motorola razr M?

This is a fucking shit the iphone are famous for the button. Where is the fucking button?! I want the button!

remember sony xperia

I&#39;m sick and tired of isheeps saying omgggg iphone is the best sooo innovative man they can suck this big fat dick ol apple brainwashed niggas

Marques Brownlee or EverythingApplePro?

Maybe that frame on the screen will be clear? Idk, that looks pretty ugly lol

All the Apple vs Samsung talk... Show me the Samsung (or any Android) that gets official security updates for 4 years from the manufacturer. Samsung makes great hardware and shit software. Source: had Samsungs from 2012 until last year.

THIS IS FAKE NO WAAY

Everyone&#39;s raging on about Samsung and Apple, meanwhile I&#39;m quite happy here using my 2 year old Nexus 6p...

Yo great video !! . I was looking for your thoughts on the Essential Phone but couldn&#39;t find anything. Are you gonna be making a video on that, I would love to hear your input on it.

Ugliest thing I have ever seen.

Regarding fingerprints, they aren&#39;t really that secure anyway. Your phone is literally covered in them, they&#39;re easy to get and the sensors aren&#39;t that hard to fool. You&#39;re more likely to be secure with a good password than your fingerprint.

Please iPhone 8 is already obsolete before it comes out

Global obsession on the bezelless displays...Yes, sure these phones look good but I appreciate software features more than doubtful design solutions.

I work in apple store...this is not i phone 8, nobody can know the new i phone 8

i will buy a samsung galaxy S8 plus 

So many salty fan boys, both phones have their ups and downs and one will always be better than the other in some aspect. Some years Samsung will be ahead of apple and vice versa. Also other companies like LG may take the lead some day

Dude, i like your channel but please remove the snake man.  I hate snakes.  Many people do and this is a big deal.  Enough to be a channel watch breaker.

It&#39;s ugly

no

I&#39;m

sony

In India we buy the iPhone for double price like iPhone 7 plus for 2400$$$

anyone else notice the spinning fidget spinner?

Where can u find the clock in this phone?

I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s sooooooooo ugly

Iphone is a fucking product. Regret buying this fucking expensive shit.

LOL at the spinner

Thats gonna be a problem with people with full/hardcore make up on

It&#39;s ugly

I have one question: when you looking a YouTube video on this panel in landscape, how it will look like with the iSight-Bar with auricle and co? You will always have a cut on one side. Maybe we are on the wrong way.

Pretty much an uglier version of &quot;The Essential Phone&quot;...

the ugliest design ever

Are there any Russians?
IPhone&#39;s are overpriced af

The model just looks... Weird. Idk, I&#39;m just not a fan of it. There&#39;s just something off about the look, but maybe the software will improve the look/feel of it?

apple invent smartphone, dont imitate innovate

Very good for making significant changes
And this my friends is why Samsung is better then apple.

It&#39;s weird that they shrunk the phone. Seems they will release some VR device in the next years. Also the amount of sensors in the front side is strange, like if they not only want facial recognition, but wanted to make an avatar of your face for VR use. Aside of that, I don&#39;t see too many uses for telemetry on a front camera that&#39;s going to be used for selfies, unless it has a thermal sensor also, that could be useful for health related apps.

What about we just waits for Apple to announce it instead of talk about HOW the new Iphone might look like.. Pleas enlighten me! I&#39;m an IOS-dude but just dont get the hype about the new phones? It&#39;s just around the corner.. WAIT for it...

So my girlfriend can unlock my phone while I&#39;m sleeping with my face ..... Nope samsung it is

Samsung Galaxy S8 review on this channel 2.8 million views. iPhone 8 model, 4 million views. Apple &gt; SamshitSays everything  

Don&#39;t like it? Don&#39;t buy it, simple as that. But I reckon sales will, dwarf any android or Samsung phone on the market, despite costing more.

my fiance has iphone 7+ nice phone but dont do full screen photos,only while recording, i hope 8 series will get this issue fix.thanks

You got your music from Spandau Ballet. Classy.

Holy shit that looks ugly af

Flat side would be awesome instead of rounded one.

only i think its ugly ？

Not a fan. Apple is out. Pixel is in.

Finally! That&#39;s one good change in design, I guess, ey Apple?

Nice job apple and steve jobs, making millions in a third world country that assembles your parts for free. Child labor is a wonderful thing.

Wow that looks shitty

UGLY

what up with snake at 2.55

The thing on the wall on the right side is not in line with the others :D HOUUUS THAAAT POSSIBRUUU?? :D

The white bezel ....... Why would they wrap the screen around the camera sensors? Odd.

SAY NADA

apple: hey can i hold the s8?Samsung: yeah just dont steal anythi-Apple-BOONK GANG WHOLE LOTTA GANG SHIT YALL KNOW WHAT IT I-

It looks ugly

i will buy . this is good

This is actually pretty good! It looks so legit!

D*mnLook just like iron man mask

I can&#39;t even get a new phone anytime soon but even if I could I wouldn&#39;t get this new iPhone. I currently have the iPhone 7 and it&#39;s okay but this new iPhone does not look good to me at all. I was hoping that they would take some feedback from what people have said they don&#39;t like but I don&#39;t think they ever will

You got a fidget spinner and a snake and lots of flashing things, my ADD is going ape shit, jheez

Plz do
Plz I want a strong start to continue with confidence

Plz promote my channel
Plz

Plz

Looks realllllyyy similar to the s8. Smaller bezels, glass back, Apple wasn&#39;t really steering towards those things until the s7 or s8 did really well with that design.

its 2017 and people are still fighting over which phone is better?  Just be happy your mommy and daddy bought you a expensive phone 

Samsung just made an evolution of the smartphone. Step up your game apple

Marques, coulda left a warning before dropping a snake in that shot. Came in for an iPhone video, left reminded of my phobia.

Do people actually care about wireless charging?

People gonna find out hard way how actually useless is the bottom part of the screen on a phone with no bottom bezels. 1) If they put the footer such as usual tabs on the very bottom of the screen it will throw off the balance as it will require you to hold the phone much hire and end up being top heavy. It will also introduce a lot more finger or even worse hand travel2) If they keep essential button functions such as home button it will most likely remain the same size on screen as its current physical counterpart thus reserving the same amount of screen estate as current bottom bezel. Sure it would hide it self on the scroll and maybe get the back button next to it or some sort of app overflow menu but it still would not yield much of advantage over a current bezel as it would reserve the space for the current hardware function. If they intend to make the basic function software buttons smaller then go read number 1

Will Apple be launching Apple Watch3 this September? Or this year???

I&#39;m surprised Apple hasn&#39;t removed the charging jack since they&#39;re all about a &quot;wireless future&quot;

So if someone knocks you out they can scan your face and take your phone and credit card info and other info, thanks

This phone looks pretty ugly!

nah i&#39;m good i&#39;ll stick to my iphone 7 atm then probs switching to galaxy s8 or google pixal,  i don&#39;t really like the desing especially the camera placement but i am still looking foward to see the official features tho

Kind of wish it was bigger...but will defo end up getting it if the camera specs are better than the 7+

Looks awful and prob has low end specs like every iPhone but people still gonna buy this. Jesus Christ.

uggly.

Purple Bathtube
Where is the time going to be on the home screen?

What if I have a identical twin? You f***ed up

Is fake this iPhone

Tf apple.

looks alike like that apple is trying to look like samsung, and i remember the days when samsung wanted to look like apple phone

I love you
I like the Kevin Durant cameo tbh

A solution
It doesn&#39;t look impressive... it&#39;s actually kinda ugly...

Ok is it just me, or does this iPhone look hideous?

What is sweet, sweet 5, or just look and use it
Can&#39;t we just stop the whole Samsung/Apple battle or even better, Android/iOS battle? They are 2 different phones/OS and everyone has different taste. I used to be strongly against Apple in iPhones, but I finally decided to buy an iPhone 6S Plus and I couldn&#39;t be happier. the phone and OS suits me more and I really didn&#39;t like Android back in the day when it got on phones buggy after 1 year of use and I haven&#39;t experienced that on iPhone. I can&#39;t say how it is now and I believe Android is a great platform, but I don&#39;t prefer it... Stop acting like children and stop the hate

I like it, but white front just doesn&#39;t look good anymore... only black fronts maybe?

Looks fuckin ugly
the chrome looks so cheap

Apple better get rid of the white front display in the iPhone 8

I think it&#39;s ugly

Make a video on nokia 8

S8 still wins.
2017 the yr Apple plays catch up design-wise

Are you from Trinidad?

My eyes it&#39;s so ugly it&#39;s soooooo uuuugly MY EYES!!!!

lol, no thank you. I&#39;m a person who spend over 3 grand for my PC. but that shit is retarded.

That chrome metal frame and the buttons on it look cheap af

How can facial recognition be safer than a fingerprint?

When does this phone sale?I&#39;m Japanese.There is not much information about this in Japan.I want this phone.Please tell me.

No headphone jack is a total deal breaker.

Lmao Samsung got rid of the side bezels years ago with their edge displays, good to see apples still 3 years behind as always.

Apple is the best shit producer ever.

Ugly as shit

After Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ design and specs, for Apple there is no more steps to go down!

Its fire and shit

3D FACE THING? No please, really. Had it on android for years (ofc) and it sucks. Typical apple. Im out

Isn&#39;t the iPhone 7s supposed to come out this year, not the iPhone 8?

the front looks so awful, not as clean as samsung s8

I don&#39;t like it... It looks like a privacy screen protector made on it...

that looks like where motorola should have gone with the razer with that forehead

triggered by the fidget spinners in the background

Hope the final design isn&#39;t as ugly. It looks like an iPhone 7 with a transparent case on it.

Not loving the spinner and the snake props.

Samsung: Trend setters of premium quality and rulers of the smart phone kingdom. Iphone: Been making dummies and calling them phones since 2007

What an ugly ass phone...

I WIL BUY EVERY YEAR THE NEWEST IPHONE! TAKE MY MONEY APPLE BOSSES!

fiveultimate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

Why is this comment section just filled with ranting android fanatics (Samsung fanboys more than anything)? We get it you hate iPhones, no need to preach like the end of the world is near. Funny thing is you go to an Android phone video and there is also ranting about how iPhone sucks.

Why is there a snake by the phone?? :O

That snake scared the shit out of me

I mean people break their phones anyway. <b>holding a cracked phone</b> lol

Great Quality= MKBHD Big Fan!!
Looks sick 
I hope it comes with a black bezel. That white sticks out

Those white bezels are killing me if the iPhone 8 has white bezels I&#39;m to losing faith in apple the white bezels are ugly ass fuck + the fact that no home button and no headphone jack, don&#39;t even get me started on the vertical camera

ugly af

I prefer iphone 6/7 body, and the iphone 8 is ugly.

The s8 is just sexy as f. This is plain ugly

Samsung galaxy phones still look better

I don’t believe such an ugly i8
How are they gonna make cases for it

u r ma nigga!!
The iPhone looks really good, bigger screen in a smaller body. Love it, why has no one else thought of this? 

I hate the camera

Marques doesn&#39;t care if you agree or not with anything he says. Marques is only interested in the number of views he gets. More views equal more money for him. Marques is a happy man.

its ugly no thanks

Without the home button, it looks just like Android...
Sooooooo the copied the S8. Got it.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and I was planning on getting the next iphone just to try apple but I don&#39;t know about that now. I just don&#39;t like the design.

goodiPhone 8, iPhone 8 model, iPhone 8 unboxing, review, iPhone 8 review, analysis, dummy, model, iPhone 8 dummy, iPhone 8 display, screen, iPhone 8 screen, mockup, ios 11, iPhone, Apple iPhone, Apple iPhone 8, unboxing, MKBHD

I bet the new iphone will be an inferior to android phone as always and apple will charge over 1k and stupid isheeps will pay that money

I phone 8So stupid they gotta stopMaking moreiPhones

sheep time

Hate the model they changed there design all the I phones before looked the same this one looks so different

That Vertical Dual camera on the back is ugly AF!

Instead of making tons of videos based on guessing how this f... phone will look like there is more interesting things than this for now. They will release it it will be the big thing for how long one week? You will see functions and “new” things that other smartphones had already and then what....

look so dope.....that would be great if the fingerprint is on that apple logo....

I think it&#39;s ugly or at least jarring.  Doesn&#39;t photograph well and I am very skeptical of 3D facial recognition.  How well does it work in low light?  What about when I am driving and want to do simple tasks like advance the track ?  Lots of questions that need answered.  Intial reaction is to stick with the safer 7s design which I am sure will have the same fast internals.  Or at least wait for 8s

Didn&#39;t the iPhone 4 and 5 have glass backs?

Are there Arabs here? 
the black canvas on the right is misaligned

xiaomi mi mix looks a bit more clean than this, and original because of the earpiece... nevertheless, at least apple is doing some kind of new stuff

RIP OFF OF SAMSUNG S8 EDGE!

If this was an Android phone everyone would just talk about how shit it looks.

RIP IPhones. every year they find a way to shoot themselves in the foot. the design from last years model was a lot better than this year. but no mater what everyone is still going to buy it. its been 10 years of iphones and they still cant manage to keep up with the tech that is currently out there right now.

This will be the last great iPhone. The move will be towards cellular tablets. Why put up with a tiny screen when you can have a nice tablet? Cellular speeds are increasing making video a must and 5G is insanely fast. Incredible we went from basic phones to the iPhone and will go back to basic phones. You simply don&#39;t need that capability in a tiny screened phone. I&#39;d like to see a phone the size of the original iPhone released.  The only thing that will save the iPhone is if they turn it into a mac. You can plug it into a larger screen and use it as a computer. The iPhone will be a hub. Bottom line it&#39;s definitely not worth $1000. And of course they&#39;ll go with face only. You can&#39;t feed the gov biometric database otherwise.

iPhone now looks lyk crap.. they removed the signature home button now it lyk any other Android plus they decided to twist the camera vertically..Damnn

Who else got iphone 8 convirsel befor the vid?

I like this!!!

where i can get that wallpaper??

I would rock this phone, but I don&#39;t need it!!! UGH!

yesterday i farted in the apple store,evryone got upset at me.Its not my fault they dont have windows

Can you hold up a picture of your face and it will unlock too?

Becoming less unique, soon the only difference between Apple and android will the the price tag that comes with the logo

No iphone 8 yes samsung galaxy s8 nice good video
This phone looks like shit and it&#39;s obvious that Tim crook is all about the dollars at this point. Where the innovation? Where&#39;s the justification for the price? I upgraded to the 7+ from a regular 6, and it&#39;s become apparent that I will be keeping my 7+ until Apple Gives INNOVATION! And if not, I will be going back to the galaxy note

Looks like an older galaxy note.

Terrible tracking, it didn't work. To the top!
Your lisp is hurting my ears

Funny how,Apple users always hate Samsung,but copy their displays and ideas....

Im a Apple fanboy since the iphone 3GS

Please make a video on LG q6

Wtf? That phone looks horrible sorry apple

Desing  /0Price/799....From now ,Waiting Samsung S9....

thanks I am finding out more about 8. braden brand sister reality tv.

ew。。。
Horrible design.
I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s the ugliest phone I&#39;ve ever seen I would rather the old models

who else likes their own comment to get the ball rolling?

The screen is OK. The overall design of iPhone 8 is total crap. I understand it&#39;s only a prototype... So keep my fingers crossed it looks much prettier than this piece of shit.

apple just riped samsung and android look with the 8

looks like a samsung device
so much click bait
These iPhones look worse and worse with each new version...
The model looks very ugly imo. I&#39;d stick with the 7 instead of buying that.

what price iPhone 8 in usa

Watching this on galaxy s8 glad i didn&#39;t wait for the iPhone 8

Oh no bby what!!! is you doing??

Am I the only one who was freaked out by the snake

bro this phone is so ugly god damn

Anyone else see the fidget spinner

why is this guy popular lol.. plus hes black

I think it&#39;s very ugly. I&#39;ll keep my 6s plus.

Pixel 2?

IPhones are a trend that&#39;s why they sell. Also apple treats their customers like dumb Ass&#39;s. And no I&#39;m not biased I have had an iPhone since the 3gs. They also stupidly removed the headphone jack to make the phone slightly thinner like we give a fuck. Y&#39;all just justify it because your minds are programmed to take whatever they give you with no questions or logic.

The Iphone is just turning into a Samsung

Fuck u

Is that yamaha hs 8 speaker in the background?

Where&#39;s the home button??

What do you say, English people?
Looks like some Chinese toy.
Essential phone?
your fidget spinner  are  .awsome.....

we need a curved oled display. glass back will be awesome. fuck a case!

That is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ugly sos but it is

Bruh..... It looks like a ANDROID SMARTPHONE
But I gotta admit that that thing is UGLY

Iphone 7 looks are way better!!!

Why no close up shots?

that glass back is ugly af. it looks like a shitty year 2000 sharper image product.

where do you buy this Prototypes?

ugly af

This is just a mock-up, right? not official.

what about siri

Help me pls my iphone 7 like a put it in the water for a like a second and then the front camera doesn t work like there some sorts of bubble and also my home button doesn t work and there s like a band up in my screen (idk if u understand) like small tirets idk what to do its the second time I broke it and my parents will be desapoint if they know it (idk the english very well )

it looks ugly, seriously!

nice clickbait
when the glass back was on the s6 samsung with wireless and the s6 edge like 2 years ago

Nope

glass back? well that&#39;s old

TBH i have a iPhone 7 just because i like the software, but my parents have Samsung 8&#39;s and i would say they are WAY better than the iphone.

<del>lets make it so that it breaks even easier</del> GENIUS!

Apple is usually AHEAD of the pinnacle designs of smartphones.Whether you like it or not, that is the design of the future. As a designer, we appreciate what Apple designs. To the average consumer who does not have a vision of design, it might look ugly. But to us designers, it looks fantastic.Going to get the new iPhone as soon as it is out. Afterall, I do make 75k annually...

The 6s was the last iPhone worth buying

That fidget spinner rotates like by itself. The center of those things don&#39;t move like that

No 3.5mm Audio Jack AAAANNNNDDD no thumbprint reader, no thanks.   hate to say it but im going back to Android.  The the 3.5mm Audio was something i was hoping they would wake the fuck up about and bring it back but it was a long shot... but no thumbprint reader?  NOPE, not going to own a phone that doesnt offer that. I like that at night in bed if i want to buy an app or a song while laying down i can just slide my thumb over and boom, it knows who i am and verify&#39;s it and my purchase is downloading.  I don&#39;t see the facial rec and its sensors pulling that off smoothly or on the first or second try.  The Fingerprint reader on the power button would be cool but for those of us who run cases it would make it non useable so thats pointless.  fuck apple, you screwed up the iphone over these last couple years so damn bad.  Can&#39;t believe the Pixel is going without the 3.5mm headphone jack too, that is just so retarded.  Its going to suck that im going from macbook pro, ipad pro, 2 apple tv 4&#39;s and an iPhone 6+ and going to ditch the phone to go with a samsung more than likely.  There goes the connectivity between all devices thanks to stupid decisions at apple.  Fuck off Apple and you retards in charge

The iris scanner is just a gimmick the fingerprint scanner worked fine, the only reason why people are going to buy this is because they are I isheep, they think the iris scanner is cool ( it isn&#39;t its fucking dumb ) or they like the design

At least it can&#39;t be hacked like android

Sure am happy I&#39;m waiting on the 8 and even then I&#39;ll wait like 6 months after the release to get the bugs out...looking better then the seven I hope the camera gets upgraded because Samsung has gone above and beyond with theirs

Steve Jobs &lt; SAMSUNG
It&#39;s funny because this is like what LG did. They just reduced the top and bottom bezels, but the side bezels are still wide AF.

the snake!!!! it was breathing11

Doesn&#39;t really have that crisp clean design I like from apple.

Will a glass back increase or decrease the weight?

That random fidget spinner tho

Hmm I&#39;m still rocking the iphone 5s, I was gonna wait for the 8 but I think I might just get the 7 plus.

No matter what people are going to buy the iPhone 8 because it&#39;s the iPhone 8 no matter how ugly(or pretty) it might be <b>NO HATE ENTENDED</b>

Is it just me or this actually looks like shit...

Finally IPhone Made It !No Bars/lines on the Back !I Like It ! No, I actually Love It !

I think it looks ugly galaxy s8 plus looks much much better

No! I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s smaller than Android phones. Been an Android user my whole cell phone life! My family kids and hubby would like me to finally make the change to iPhone. My Son told me to wait for this new iPhone 8. I&#39;m not sold so far!!! I&#39;m waiting for the new Samsung Note to come out.  The one thing that concerns me is the screen size and weight of the iPhone. I like the battery life of the iPhone. Thank you

It is really small nothing is batter then iPhone 6s plus

Black iphone 8 will match perfect on that screen

bro what camera do you use its so high quality

And shit alive the Samsung.
That fidget spinner&#39;s center moving...

Japanese
ewwwwww its a snake in the vid its alive

I&#39;m not unlocking my fucking phone with my face or eye. Fuck that.

That white bezel is disgusting. I hope apple is sensible enough to make it black regardless of the colour of the back of the phone.

no, this is ugly.the back is like iphone4, the front looks like freaking samsung and htc!!!! WHY WOULD APPLE CHANGE ITS ICONIC HOME BUTTON!!!

This thing I hideous! I would be embarrassed to show this to people.

Steve Jobs rolling in his grave

LMAO, IPHONE 8 WOULD NEVER LOOK LIKE THAT! NO UGLY WAY!

There is no button?!

Was it just me that saw the small snake??

Where is the clock in the status bar going? The top bezel hump is in its place. I hope it&#39;s not apples way of making you buy a smart watch.

Well i am loving that fidget spinner :D

shit&#39;s ugly as hell

I&#39;d buy it if the price isn&#39;t ridiculous

2016 genaration No 3,5mm jack 2017 generation No battery :D
If Apple Sued Samsung for using the same shape on their phones lol can Samsung sue Apple for copying everything they do?? 

This phone fake 100%

every single person who gets it in white needs to get punched in the face

They should place the fingerscan on the powerbutton

All this guesswork. I Think folks Will be dissapointet

Haha Spandau Ballet intro music  nice

That&#39;s fugly

Glass back copied from samsung

Ugly ugly ugly!! 
that snake though

yo marques quick question, what do you recon is the best windows laptop for video editing around the 1500 pounds mark (1900 dollers aprox), I work for a local production company primarily using pc and running adobe software - and I&#39;m looking to match that performance with a laptop, any recommendations?

Why are they going back with the super fragile glass backs like the iPhone 4?!?!Bad move, Apple. Bad move.

I just like scrolling through the comments and being like, <b>DEVICE WAR 1 &#39;SAMSUNG VERSUS APPLE&#39;.</b> And the screen seems a bit too wide. It&#39;s exposed to damage.

Ok I&#39;m going to keep my 6S 

You know what I&#39;m just going to say it...The new iPhone is fucking ugly.

I&#39;m surprised many people in the comments don&#39;t like this design because this model is actually my favorite one to date. To be fair the white color doesn&#39;t do it justice, I think judging by the glossy material that this phone will look much better in black. The glass back and the chrome edges look more classier. The larger screen to phone size ratio is much more practical than buying a larger phone for a larger screen with bulkier edges. The only thing I didn&#39;t like with this model is how the white edging on the front facing cameras is awkwardly placed. They should have just extended the edges instead of keeping the corners bare. It&#39;s not like the corners are going to be actively used or even touched, so the design doesn&#39;t feel effective. It will also distract users when playing games or watching movies. I don&#39;t even know how notifications will be placed when the edge stands in the way. I feel like the majority will purchase this model in black so the awkward top edges are less visible with the black screen when turned off.

Proof of samsung fanboys&#39; stupidity:Oh yuck look at the iphone 7&#39;s bezels so freaking ugly! Omg the s8 is bezel-less!Now that the iphone 8 is gonna have less bezels than the s8:Look at that ugly iphone 8 designGuys seriously WTF

I think iPhone 8 is ugly

Moving back to android

That screen design could allow you to see the time and battery life whilst in a full screen application like a game unlike now it&#39;s hidden to save screen space in most.

Aesthetically it looks backwards

Meh....just another yearly smartphone.The next upgrade for me will be when a smartphone comes out that doesn&#39;t break when you drop it, and one that a thief can&#39;t simply hook up to a pc and flash the os and imei. Those are real improvements but ones that will reduce their own sales. So more than likely we will just keep getting better cameras and screens.

<b>U G L Y</b>

I&#39;m just gonna buy xiaomi phone.
I herd is going to be around 2thousand dollars . Watch how fast this will be sold out

Apple copying Samsung with the wireless charging, iris scanner glass back and small bazels if things were the other way around there would be apple fanboy outrageOh and apple phones are overrated 

So disappointed about the glass back. I used to have a galaxy s6 edge+ and the glass back cracked on the first drop.

Not my Iphone

Ugly as fuck but people are still gonna buy it.

Ok I forever have been using an iPhone but let&#39;s be honest this looks ugly as shit compared to the S8

All zak
The camera looks like street lights smh the phone is ugly I was gonna buy it

Look I&#39;m not an apple fanboy/iSheep but i honestly think this phone looks nice haha, i pove iPhones and apple products and don&#39;t really enjoy samsungs purely because of android, I&#39;m used to ios and i love the look and feel and flow of it but that doesn&#39;t mean i don&#39;t  know that samsung and android phones are far superior in technology, software and creativeness, but i honestly just want a nice looking flowy phone that i like to use for simple things like social media, videos, photos and games and to me the iPhone does it well for me

this is proof that apple has been slowly dying ever since jobs passed away. this new design looks like a lot of lg and samsung elements awkwardly bolted onto a perfectly good iphone.

I hope it doesnt look like this for real. That top bit with all the sensors and speaker is absolutely hideous.

Hey Marques. My name is Kyle. I was working at the Chick-fil-A you ate at an hour ago. It was so cool to see you! Hope you enjoyed the food!

samsung is looking tight AF after this, but i cant leave now, everything i store digitally is apple...dammit

looks like shit

Dock for a lot for a lot and then the way I will have

Just ewww

Looks ugly as shit

I think the black color of this will look better to hide the top sensors...

It doesn&#39;t look fururostic at all...

V NICE TO SEE AMERICAN BOIS GIVING GRIME A BIT OF LOVE ️️️
I hope OnePlus doesn&#39;t copy this...

Wait what phone does it reminds me of, i cant put a finger on it...... oh wait yeah, Galaxy s8

Watch out for all of the Samsung fanboys who are getting proper salty in the comments 

It&#39;s hideous!!

Camera looks like a traffic light
Feio!

I had facial recognition on my Samsung galaxy s4 mini, like 5 years ago...

I don&#39;t mind top and bottom bezzles if they aren&#39;t huge and preferably are black. I think people wanting a phone that a giant thin screen only device is so strange. I prefer to keep my devices pretty, so more screen just sounds like more smudges and a gimmick. These super thin phones also just slip out of your hand, especially the larger ones. I like when phones had a bit more shape to em. Not exactly a brick, but something like a slightly larger screened iPhone 4S would be perfect. The Galaxy S5 was the first bigger, thin phone I owned, and also the first phone who&#39;s build constantly annoyed me. Eventually it&#39;s shape ended up causing it&#39;s demise when it had simply slipped from being leaned against something (since you can&#39;t put a phone on it&#39;s side anymore), fell on a rock and completely killed the screen.

This is not actual a model this is the actual phone they removed everything but the shell of it innovation at its best

Watching this on my s8 like... Yikes  still happy I didn&#39;t get an iPhone. Left that shit 2 years ago and never going back 

Looks terrible.

Just Get yourself an S8.

Marq B please quit with the snakes bro. Good review by the way.

Best looking iPhones were 4 and 5. Nothing came close.

V uglyyyyy
SEXY GUY, LOVE YOUR LONG FINGERS

It looks like absolute shit..

He talks cute af
I was an iPhone person for a long time and still love Apple but traded in my 6S+ and I got a Samsung S8+ and honestly after these renders and everything I&#39;m happy with my choice

Apple removed headphone jack, now the home button and then.... the camera?

Plz can you speak in hindi

Gorgeous

Even though the older iPhones had huge bezels, I like them for their clean look. The iPhone 8 honestly looks ugly to me

thats an adorable ball python!!

Is that an actual snake?

The iPhone model is cool, but I&#39;m more impressed that a Shakka song was used in the intro!

looks like a damn toy hope all this isn&#39;t true

glass back??? ..iPhone 4????..

Am i the only one who thinks that this design is shit?

Lol it&#39;s so ugly
 i stay with my iphone 7. Until they realize that this phone looks like  LG phones . So embarrassing design

I am pretty sure in the future, Apple will come out with customizable phones just like laptops.Adding a headphone jack-400$.Adding screen-600$ etc. In the end we will have a phone which costs as much as all the organs.

WTF

I&#39;m good! I love my Galaxy S7 edge! Waiting for the Note 8.

can you give me any smartphone

Pixel still sucks.
...so my old ip4 with a glass back is similar...;--),,,,,,,

Looks like a bathroom sandal

Life is about choice. No matter what consideration Samsung or Apple. Choose what you like . Simple

LG G6 ?

thanks for the video Marques, but damn the iPhone 8 looks ugly

yeah I&#39;m very interested and curious

This is one ugly ass phone.

I will never buy an apple product because someone has probably used it, and my proof is the bite mark on the apple. Yep not buying it.

The iPhone 8 reviewme - look at that fidget spinner go.

I will stick on my Charlie Cunningham - Minimum (Chill Out Your Heart Remix) until the iphone 10 release.

Apple always surprises. No matter how many leaks come out, they always manage to drop some shit nobody expected. They do it every year. I&#39;m reserving judgement until actual release.

Double the thickness, double the battery. I&#39;m still looking for a modern smartphone which can last all day and go far into the night.

Reasons to in subscribe you

That&#39;s one ugly phone

Honestly the design looks mediocre...when he says it looks super premium...I am done

didn&#39;t think they could have made such an ugly phone

Seems like the designs just get worse as time goes by.

You guys do know this isn&#39;t the official model right? This is the model THEY came up with. THEY made it look ugly and cheap, not apple. At the beginning of the video he said it was a representation of the leaks and rumors...

I don&#39;t don&#39;t like iOS so I&#39;ll never buy an iPhone again but damn that phone looks beautiful, don&#39;t get the hate at all.

Yea I&#39;ll stick to the 7 if this is real

Ugly eew

Is this guy related to Bruce Lee? Cause Brown Lee! Ok, that was rubbish.

Yeaaa I&#39;ll stick with my iPhone 7 128gb. That shit is HIDEOUS 

Someone remind me to comeback to video after they release the actual iPhone 8 design.I wanna see if it&#39;s legit lmao

: OH MY .....meh..

I want the iPhone 8 :(Never mind, I want the IPhone 7 instead.

Wtf happened to the top.. that shit looks ugly AF!!!!!

If there really is no finger print reader, I will be disappointed. I don&#39;t want to have to pull my phone out, hold it level with my face, and stare into the camera like an idiot every time I want to unlock my phone.

No, facial recognition can be faked with a photo, or video, fingerprint is a lot harder.

Apparently there&#39;s an update of the Electronic Image Stabilisation on the OnePlus 5.. quick update video? ;)

i&#39;ll just keep my 7
Where did you get the wal piece on the wall behind you? The red and black

The Greatest iPhone is the 6S. I&#39;m sticking to it until Apple figures out wtf they&#39;re doing.

I&#39;m an apple fan, and I own an iPhone 7+. I don&#39;t think Apple would that phone, how it is here. I believe the idea about the display is right, and I believe in that camera bump, but I don&#39;t think they would put out, the phone like this. The frame is very ugly i my opinion.

iphone 6s best phone ever
Impossible it will look like that at all

The vertical Dual Camera is so Hideous.

Oh my god I hope this isn&#39;t real.  This looks fucking awful.  Great video as always Marques

That&#39;s the most uglyiest phone I have ever seen

Does it slip out of your hands as so many other phones (including iPhones)?

Well I said &quot;what about in the power button&quot; on your last video cause I don&#39;t think you even mentioned it. I&#39;m still going with that, I bet the fingerprint reader will be there.

You didn&#39;t (or may not have in this video) mention the fact that apple removed their iconic home button.I&#39;m not a apple user (but am a fan of the change) though wouldn&#39;t some people dislike their being no home button?

I phone just copied the s8 everything about the screen iseas are from s8. Iphone cant make ideas for them selves smh.

Looks like poop

I want it. Can I trade my iphone7 for the 8?

That fidget spinner gave me cancer but MKBUHD saved me.

iShit iPhone 8

Is there a video about your lighting setup? It&#39;s ridiculously good!

ANDROID WANNABE

So when you watch movies or something you have a speaker and camera and sensors on the side of the video.? Or do you think it blacks out on top and squares off the video ??

I’m switching over to Android. Sony Xperia.

Please give me one iphone  please

The iPhone 4 and 4s had a glass back

The top cutout omg. I never feel ashamed in my whole life. Fuck you whoever you are who designed this.

The camera bump, that fugly notch on the front? UGLY. Period. The whole white bezel versus metal frame. Wow. That&#39;s more than ugly. Looks like a very cheap Chinese idea of a phone.

It&#39;s ugly. Come on, say it!

from 1 year and for 2 years if future i will keep my iphone 5c , i will not upgrade they cost too much

This phone looks sickening!

Nice intro!

this shit is terrible

Where is charger port and headphone jack !!

This is sad... Reminds me of when PS4 started raping the shit out of Xbox sales

I don’t think that there will be a white front. I think all colors will come with black bezels on the front.

I have an S8+ and am in love with it. When watching HDR content or 1440p youtube videos the screen is just incredible.I have a Macbook 12 inch 2016 Model and LOVE it! Full Apple OS is just gorgeous.Looking at this Iphone I have to say it is a let down (its not out yet I know) and we all know Iphone OS is restricted as hell, you cannot arrange the screen icons, lets use that as a base.Now all those who criticised Samsung, they set a BAR with their infinity display, this is what all phones in late 2016 and 2017 will have, some form of an infinity display. Apple keeps removing things, no jack, no SD card, no finger scanner (potentially) only thing they add was the cost for this device, hope they price themselves out of the competition and people use their hard earned money wisely. Poor stay poor because they suck with money ;) give a poor guy 5 mill and he will be poor within 3 years. Be smart guys.Its not innovative, new, trend setting, next big thing. Its a crap outdated device only with an Apple logo. You will behind as you always have been buying Iphone.

It looks like an iPhone 4, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8 mashed together

Thats some EPIC editing on after effects putting the screen on the phone

So fucking ugly man

nah id rather stick to S8 plus

Looks shit tho

They&#39;re running out of ideas and innovations.

it looks like a fucking idiot

Where is home button

I think there shouldn&#39;t be so much buys for this phone, it will be just awesome looking, but not worth the moneys. iPhone 6s has everything you need from apple.
