Also if you are just sitting there not paying attention then suddenly see a snake coming you don&#39;t always watch how they are moving you see snake and think oh shit run or grab. As soon as she grabbed it you can tell she realized it was fake

If you guys took time out of your day to look it up they pranked her but she didn&#39;t know. Her brother and sister were hoping she&#39;d run but where they live they used to catch snakes all the time. Yes he was pranking her but she didn&#39;t know it and she grabbed it right up thinking it was real

The cobra looking dead

Good try I see someone you sing a fishing Rod and cobras can’t move straight good try

Cobra looks fake
Everyone is saying that it’s fake but I’m thinking of what happened after she threw Cobra

The people who thought this was real has no brain 1. Snakes dont slither in straight lines2. Theres a shadow of a man with a fishing rod3. Snakes dont frickin flop on the ground and bounce like wth

FAKE FAKE FAKE

A cobra NEVER moves in a straight line, they always move like some kind of worm lol and you can clearly see the man holding a fishing rod

It&#39;s FAKE THE SHADOW WAS SO OBVIOUS

Be honest you didn’t find that it is fake you watched inside edition!

U see the shadow and they never go in straight lines

Its easy to see that its fake somehowThe other people think, oh wow she brave, well they didnt see the thing over there, if you dumb well Ok...

Cap

Whos here because of ibside edition just me ok

There’s a shadow of a man holding a fishing pole. And plus cobras aren’t that color. She is in Africa I can tell and cobras are in India. And cobras don’t move in a strait line. And when she threw that cobra the cobra tumbled on its back and didn’t move

FAKE

Why do People still dislike?The Videos still good!Even tho it&#39;s Faked.Everyone who disliked, stop Holding your Phone upside down!

The snake is fake because they go around you they don’t go one by mission yeah

That is fake because I saw a shadow of a guy reeling in a fishing rod

Look in the shadow on the right bottom and there’s proof because inside edition made a video about this which is FAKE. Thanks for reading

this is fake in the right corner you can see someone using a fishing rod to bring it in AND a cobra doesnt move in a straight line it moves in a s form

Wow did people actually believe this?

Fake

Fake

You can see the reel in the background, and snakes don’t move in a straight line, they curve in a figure eight shape. This is faker then Kim Kardashian’s ass.

What language are they speaking?

There’s a fishing rod as you can see in the shadow

1. Someone behind her is holding a fishing rod 2. Science has never found a cobra close to its colors 3. A cobra doesn’t go straight it’s moves in a S path 5. A snake wouldn’t flop around when it dead like that or after it’s thrown it will still be able to slither around/ to you 6. This is just a hoax

<a href="">0:02</a> look at that shadow of a fishing rod, hmm......

Yu not good

Cobras move like an S shape not strait and who is that shadow of a guy looks like he have a fishing rod this is fake watch Inside Edition WTF

Its fake

FAKE

She fye

Cobras don’t move in a straight line
nice fishing rod and fake snake

Fake

You can see the dude is using a fishing rod to pull in the snake

WOW THIS SO FAKE!!

So fake even faker than ben franklin as president

This is fake

FAKEFAKE!Watch Inside edition sweetheart.

Guys everyone knows it’s fake but it’s still cool to look at. The snakes pattern isn’t like a cobras (underneath pattern.) There is a shadow and it shows you the fishing rod. When she tosses the “snake” on the ground it doesn’t move and it just flops onto the ground like dead weight. Also the way it’s moving isn’t a way a King Cobra would move. As you can tell even a little kid can tell the difference. But it’s meant for enjoyment, so, ENJOY it! 

You can tell it&#39;s fake because if you look at the shadow it shows the man with a fishing hook

I don’t understand why people hate on this video so much. It’s an obvious prank they tried to pull on the young woman and they’re not trying to fool viewers into thinking it was a live cobra attacking. I think the video is amusing and lighthearted. I don’t understand what the male voice says but it obviously sounds like he’s having fun. Thank you for sharing this video.

Fake!

how can anyone think this is real

That is so fake

Idk y everyone is saying its fake, when the lady grabbed the snake, she killed it by snapping its neck. So when she threw it it landed like that. and the dude with the fishing rod was legit just fishing with a long ass wire. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so yall r dumb...

Yes , this is fake , but it is actually a prank for the girl..

Fake

that is fake you can see a shadow rolling. the snake the cam cought it

This is FAKE

Fake so fake

hi

Oh sheesh, so fake.  Fooled me the first time I saw it, though.

Look at the shadow. It looks like a guy is reeling in the snake with a fishing rod. Doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not saying this video is fake but it seems suspicious.

Theres a guy with a fishing rod attached to the snake.... and snakes dont go in a straight line!.... And The snake looked like it was dead!!  Its Fake!! EXPOSED

There&#39;s a guy pulling a fake snake with a fishing pole and also king cobras don&#39;t move on a straight line

Fake they were moving it with the fishing rod 

uber fake

fake than wwe

So Fake It&#39;s funny

Fake

You can see the fishing rod in the shadow honey

ahhahahahhahaa

1. Dogs reactions and the other people reactions 2. Coloration of the Cobra3. You can see the shadow to the fishing rod4. Cobras can&#39;t move that fast and can&#39;t move in a straight line

fake off
You can thank Michael Jones from Achievement Hunter for showing me this short video.

There is a fishing rod reeling in the snake and cobras don&#39;t have the abilitie to go straight so it is claimed to be FALSE 

It's fake dude you can see one of the men in the back has a fishing rod and that snake looks dead so it's not even true and a snake doesn't just go straight it makes a kind of S while it's sailing so this video is not true people would believe it if the shadow of the man behind was not there.
You see the person holding a fishing rod lmao..

Anyone else see a fishing pole

Fake. I saw a man using a reel. Also, it looked dead after throw.

What they didnt show was the snake coming to her house that night with a silenced pistol

Meh it was funnier when Geoff watched it.

I heard about this, but after seeing it, it&#39;s so clearly a fake snake.

I saw this on Achievement Hunter. It&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s fake.

Oh, it&#39;s fake. I thought for half a sec it was real.

Achievement Hunter sent me here

Came here from an Achievement Hunter video

Fake or not, Geoff Ramsey shit his pants at this

Does anyone NOT see the shadow of the guy reeling this thing in?

at least hide the fishing rod so that we cant see it because we saw the shadows

fake!!!!!!!!!!

cobras don&#39;t open their hood while slithering. They only open their hood after they rear up to strike.

FAKE

who else is from bills channel

What a crazy place to live! :-)

Why are all these comments arguing that it&#39;s fake? Did you think for a second it was real?

The snake is moving in a straight line

super fake.  real snakes do not move like that to begin with.  the dogs not getting excited give clue that they are used to this fake snake.  also snakes do not attack just like that unless they feel theathened.

Fake off
fake stop doing this u can see ur shadow holding a fishing rod if ur going to do this again u need a better plan don&#39;t u

he used a fishing rod and reeled in a toy snake fakeeee

this video is fake because u can see a man&#39;s shadow on the bottom right corner with a fishing rod wheeling in the cobra

fake cuz that was not a slither that went in a straight line

this is fake if you look at the bottom right corner a guy uses a fishing rod to reel in the fake snake you can see the shadow of the line and the rod

This video is fake as fucking shit.

This is so fake look at the shadow at the bottom right corner he has a rod that is obviously tied to the &#39;snake&#39;

your using a fishing rod so fake!!!!!!!

You where fishing it out this video is lame

FAKE !

so fake

First of all that snake  was going 20 miles per hour on grass plus the shadow shows theMan reeling in the snake and its true and the dog  would of freaked out from the umm &quot;snake&quot; plus It has a rubber texture

1. Fishing rod being reeled in, in the bottom right shadow2. Cobras never move in a straight line 3. Cobras can go that fast I got those all from a video I&#39;m not smart

fake

thus is fake  no way someone can do that

SO FAKKKKKKKE

so fak it funny

THIS IS SO FAKE 
I wonder what happened after

lol i just came here to say its fake! cobra&#39;s dont charge like that hood out like this toy

Man if your trying to fool someone at least get your shadow out of the video and don&#39;t make the snake THAT fast

SO FAKE ITS FUNNY SO SOSO FAKE!

fake

It&#39;s so fak, it&#39;s funny!misspelled on porpoise

theres a shadow of a man with a fishing rod so its fake

fake seen the shadow in the biggining

Fake

Fake

obviously it&#39;s fake omg that&#39;s not the point. her friends were trying to scare her with a toy snake / fishing rod thing and the way she reacted was not what they were expecting lol, if most people saw a cobra barreling towards them they&#39;d just scream and flail like an octopus.

1: Cobras slither in a zig zag motion, in the video it wasn&#39;t2: there are no cobra species with that color in the video3: when the girl catches the cobra and throws it, it looked dead like a toy4: in the bottom right corner there&#39;s a shadow of a fishing pole5:SO FAKE IT&#39;S FUNNY!!!

At first i thought it was real, then i saw a fishing rod and the snake sounds wooden.

Oh yea! It is fake.

The guy has a fishing pole it&#39;s fake

i see a man reeling a fishing rod

It is not a real snake. It is a fake snake and we can see that it is attached to a fishing line. It is being reeled in by the one with the fishing rod whose shadow we can see on the right bottom of the screen.

Unepic! I don&#39;t even know this, but.. that snack looks so............. :(

FAKE

kek

you can see he has a fishing pole in the shadow

fake because behind the girl there&#39;s a shadow of a man with a fishing ro

she knew

This is fake at <a href="">0:00</a> -<a href="">0:05</a> the man in the shadow has a fishing line and was reeling it in when she throw it it looks like it&#39;s dead it bounce and lay down

This is so funny even though it&#39;s fake

LOL

this is so fake because the shadow

This is craziest think I have ever seen

Fake

fake

I thought she was awesome until i realzied it wasn&#39;t a real snake..  but i suppose she is still.. .

1. The snake crawls straight and fast, ...with its hood open!2. When grabbed by a person, it does not wrap around the arm.3. The shadow of the fishing rod is visible...
FAKE

fishing pole shadow <a href="">#duh</a>

<a href="">#givepewdshisdiamondplaybutton</a>

Even the dogs know it is fake.

this is fake as hell you can tell by the way it moves. cobras don&#39;t move like that and the the shadow of him reeling it is a dead giveaway

this fake there&#39;s a fishing rod and I got information from billschannel

fake you can see a shadow on the right and it&#39;s a fishing hook so they tied it to the rubber snake to make it look real

Fake!

is that a rubber snake getting reeled in and then i see a fishing rod in the shadow is this fake

Fake the shadow shows the dude reeling in a fishing rod

SHE KNEW IT WAS FAKE! SHE WOULDNT OF JUST TOSSED IT OFF LIKE THAT IF IT WAS REAL! bottom line she still got some bad reflexes/hand eye coordination

duh fake
Besides the fishing line, a cobra would probably never do that and they don&#39;t even move like that.

You can see a shadow of a fishing rod and hear it in the background .... 100% REAL DEAL

this is fake.....look a shadov behind girl

fake the shadow show a person with a fishing rod catching the FAKE snake and so she can catch it!

I see the fishing pole, and he&#39;s reeling it in. I&#39;d like to see if that South African girl could catch live cobra in action.

Oh and the shadow of the guy using a fishing rod to reel it in

Dude it&#39;s so fake I&#39;m laughing snakes are faster then that including the king cobra 

In the shadow there&#39;s a guy with a fishing pole and Cobras don&#39;t move in a straight line.

It&#39;s fake. You could notice the corner that there&#39;s a shadow of a fishing rod. So the &quot;RUBBER SNAKE&quot; is attached to the fishing rod..  

They tied the snake to a fishing rod

This is fake.

It&#39;s fake because I saw a fishing rod in the shadow of the man

Who thinks this is real? Look at the silhouette of the man. He is holding an object that looks similar to a fishing rod. He connected a string to the snake and pulled it along the grass. The first thing I noticed is the way the snake behaved. Why would a snake become hostile when the people have not harmed it. A snake would never do that.

Its fake

She is a legend, she controlled the snake. Seriously i mean it&#39;s totally real guys. Legend says that one day a woman will be sent to earth to prove that we shall not fear the cobra. She fought the evil with her hands and threw it away to demonstrate the south african &quot;gulu man hunu el chapo guzman polo gotto&quot; method of controlling the evil. Also, yes i&#39;m a troll and if you actually read through all of this bull and believed it...You deserve a medal son! Have a great 2018 €verybody and remeber to stay unhealthy.

Sooooooo fucking fake. She&#39;d run like a chicken if she saw that cobra 

Faker than islam(e) is a religion of peace

this is faker than those local whores that want to fuck

Yeah, the girl totally did not see him with the fishing rod at the start, and she totally wasn&#39;t &quot;in&quot; on the whole thing given her whole bodylanguage during the vid, not to mention absolutely zero reaction to noticing the cobra racing toward her. A premeditated stunt.

You can see the guy with a fishing rod and the cobra fake

Wow

strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

so fail
LENA HERE COMES SNAKE, SLALOM
She says like:There you go bitch!

what are is this so i know i have to stay away from it?

Hahah so fukin fake..just look at her boyfriends shadow with the casting rod.. xD

Fake

you can even see the fishingrod they are using to make it move, you see the shadow at the botom of the video

Brutal!
Hahaha...ay wonder how many people got fooled by this xD

when looking at the movement of the snakes body one can clearly see that the snake is in fact face and us pulled by something. A real snake propelles itself forward with sideways movements which the snake in the video clearly doesn&#39;t. Nevere the less a good video with a great reaction from the girl. Nice orang mate.

fake bullshit.

Fake snake

Fake! À Guy is holding à fishingrood that u Can see in the Grass!
