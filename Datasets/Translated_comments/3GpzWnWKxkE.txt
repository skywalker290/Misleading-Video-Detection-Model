We must stop looking for silly excuses for the death of the lion, some humans are crazy and like to kill animals to feel powerful, that is why education and values ​​are important, understanding the logic and seeing that the man attacked the lion and not the other way around. the lion just like that, get away
They killed a lion but the one who attacked the lion was the man, the lion was like that, get away

We are going to eat ALL THOSE WHO DARE TO OBSTRUCE JUSTICE &amp; THE TRUTH
They should have let him be eaten, they killed the Lions because of that suicide
A dead lion and an innocent but confused man with broken parts. Instead of feeling sorry, everyone is worried about which of the two to judge with hatred.
Poor lions, they were not to blame, it is somewhat understandable why they would want to save the man, but if he is mentally ill and no one takes care of him, he will attempt suicide again and the way mental health is treated in Chile it is very likely that he will. They have already left the man alone.
León: Chilean menu of the day ql wn 😂😂😂
This is how they become disturbed and fanaticized by religions. There is nothing worse than being fanatical about a religion that all it does is take advantage of its parishioners.
The worst thing is that they sacrificed the Lion 😢
that crazy man should not be loose... mentally ill
Yes but they killed the lions that were not to blame
The idiot who tried to commit suicide was saved at least most of it... The lions did kill him, and the worst thing is that it was useless since if the person really wants to kill himself he will try again. .. I just hope that next time it's with a gun.
If the man wanted to commit total suicide, they would have killed him and not the lions.
Even though he is crazy, what is the lion's fault??? I mean, if a ctm that crazy attacks me!!! Let me do whatever we want, totally ta piteao?
They would have killed him, he was totally crazy, it was a lost cause.
The lion made me feel sorry for him :(
I don't believe that in the end they kill the lions😢😢😢😢!!!
Stupid, Your Idiot Life!
how good the lion is
murio?

Yes, they killed the stupid guy from another body, those lions
I HOPE STUPID PEOPLE HAVE EATEN IT
Damn stupid!
