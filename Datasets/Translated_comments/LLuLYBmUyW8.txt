So Aaron Paul almost got hit by a what on top of a what?

<a href="">6:03</a> that happend to me before but luckily the ground was snow so it didnt hurt too bad

James Cameron doesn&#39;t do what James Cameron does for James Cameron.James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron.

Classic

Wonder how traumatized some of these people are

Bruh i have one slipped disc and it never healed... how did hers heal in a month?

Super

So why the FUCK is Jackie only #10?! That&#39;s bullshit.

I disagree with this list heavily

For Jason statham don’t forget Ivan drago and blade

Why do people think these videos are countdowns? Are you that simple!?

Jackie chan almost died In almost every movie

Oh how I loved cast away grabe

commenting everywhere challenge

you forgot about dylan o’brien in maze runner: the death cure

I would like to see a list of the top 10 actors who did die on the set. Vic Morrow I know about.

In case you didn’t hear this tody: - good morning - you look beautiful - your outfit is hella cute - your hair smells good - good job - you’re smart - keep going - stay strong - bon appetite - you have great music taste - I love you - good night - love you guys ❤️💛💜 if you can please watch my last edit❤and please subscribe to help us do more....

Uma Thurman - Kill Bill Vol 2,Daniel Day-Lewis - Gangs of New YorkBob Hoskins - Super Mario Bros

Jackie Chan is one of the greatest actors of all time

You could make a whole another list about jackie Chan nearly dying on set.

what

The only person who almost die on set and is the black actor and I don&#39;t know his name and he was on Rocky 4 and Sylvester S. and the director and they had to stop it. Who are not in the list are Colin Farrell and Jet Li and Matt Damon. James C. in The Passion of Christ. Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman.

Jim caviezal was struck by lightning filming passion of the christ

So they use real sword 👀👀👀

jackie chan deserves the first place in the world

They are only few who do their own stunts, otherwise they&#39;re performed by stunt double, so if actor could&#39;ve have this many close calls than how many stunt double might&#39;ve lost their live and even if they get injured during scene unlike celebs they dont get to much attention and care

I&#39;m so glad Isla Fisher didn&#39;t drown. 😥😥😥 She is too sweet and pretty to die. 😗😗😗

jakie chan was so lucy to escape death

Bloody ads ruin your viewing!!!!!! 😒

2012 premium Rush is my movie bike 🚲 because I’m a cyclist 🚴🏻‍♂️ it make me happy

This list is random isn&#39;t it🧐

Expendable three is my favorite movie ever

Jackie Chan will not die after getting shot in the head

hellollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

The thumbnail shows a villian, wha?

<a href="">4:29</a> Haha, it&#39;s funny because she&#39;s permanently crippled

For those wondering why at <a href="">0:40</a> Harry Potter is in the montage, Daniel Radcliff&#39;s stunt double was paralyzed while filming. Still don&#39;t know why this wasn&#39;t on the list but in the montage

It&#39;s funny because Jason Statham is the most badass of all the expendables in real life

Why isnt jackie chan on first place

OKAYYYnumber 1 Jackie Channumber 2 Jackie Channumber 3 Jackie Channumber 4 Jackie Channumber 5 Jackie Channumber 6 Jackie Channumber 7 Jackie Channumber 8 Jackie Channumber 9 Jackie Channumber 10 Jackie Chan

I wish jackie is top 1 since his spine is already gone after those dangerous stunts 😂

Jackie Chan is Jackie Tank, he should be number 1 in the list.

Did she say jackie chan has brain damage for playing in the rush hour sequels?

They missed to include when Dolphn Lundgren hit Stallon&#39;s chest so hard during Rocky IV set, which left him in ICU for 8 days.Edit: NVM. Saw it on their Part II

Even if any of these people did die they would recaranate, we would see them back on camera (Depends on what they are) Even if they aren&#39;t the same person. Acting i these peoples passions. (Sorry for my scientology)

Jackie Chan 10 ag you guys are mad

your list is bullshit , jackie should be first

100% of the comments:JACKIE CHAN IS NO. ONE??!!

Where is Sylvester stallion he was in the hospital for 4 days after a bruised heart on set in rocky IV

Why is JIm Caviezel not on this list? He went through it when filming Passion, geez.

jackie chan allmostt dies in every movie

Just do the shit stunt that no 9 girl got that spot while Jackie got 10 what the fuck mojo your list is always bad

Who agrees Jackie can 1. Bruce lee 2nd and sylvester Stallone 3rd who agrees

Rush hour was dope fuck you mojo

I agree with all of you about Jackie Chan, he should be #1.

I love how Tom Cruise is in the list I kept waiting

that wasnt kate winslet that was a stunt woman

I apologize for being honest and right but watch mojo never ranks them from worst to best they should not be getting crap about who was first and last because you want to get your way they involved him in the video so get over it and get your life together and respect them.

Jim Caviezel, accidental lashings, a dislocated shoulder, pneumonia, a lung infection, persistent migraines, and getting struck by lightning. not even an honorable mention.

Why wasn’t Jackie Chan number one I’m going to dislike because of how disrespectful you are and how many times he has almost died but continues to act

Jackie should be number 1

WHAT jason stathem

Who is watching this in quarantine

Tom hanks got corona

Honorable mention : Dylan O&#39;brien in &quot;The Maze Runner : The Death Cure&quot;

That is just stupid Jackie should have easily been 1st

I hate that you always speak so much in the video

Jackie deserves a way higher place in my opinion, easily the number one spot. He&#39;s had so many near-death experiences while acting because of his pride of doing his own stunts. The man deserves respect.

I was watching Jimmy Fallon and Jason Statham I told his expendables three story

Brendan frasiers&#39; is an honorable mention? He actually died during that scene

Everybody gangsta until the comments got mad because of jackie chan being on top 10

anyone watching in 2020

There be these people who almost died on set and then there&#39;s Brandon Lee...

I only cliked on this cos a jason statham

You forgot John Connery in James Bond from Russia with love

1-Jacki Chan2-Tom cruise3-jason Statham

Jakie Chan deserve number 1.

Jack Silcock Dislocated His Shoulder And Knee On Set Of Thor The Dark World When He Portrayed The Role Of ThunderStrike

O

Jackie chan should be in number1 fuck think well know things better before you upload this types of videos.

Shit directors

I never knew that Michael j fox was almost killed during the hanging scene!

1. Jackie Chan

I think its all for jackie chan..

Its normal thing to jackie chan..

she was lying

Kate winslet ia using a stand in so she is safe look carefully in her face its not kate

Jackie Chan deserves to be number 1

you forgot jason statham in crank 1 when he was in he was in helicopter

Another joke watch mojo, Jackie on being 10th.

Idk how Jackie Chan is still alive tbh

What about Natalie Wood? As a child, Natalie Wood fell into a rushing river during a film scene, and almost drowned. This gave her a lifelong fear of water, which is ironic, because she would drown in water years later.

Tom Hanks survived &quot;Cast Away&quot; but might die of coronavirus instead.

Man Jackie chan is a legend

Jackie chan

I almost died watching this list

<a href="">10:44</a>No, Jackie Chan should be on number #1

Well acting should be passionate

i didn&#39;t hate the lone ranger.

Burn on Jackie!

You took stupidity to a whole new level watchmojo....

I would never be a stunt double. Did u hear what she said? They were excluded because they knew what to expect. Does it at least pay well to be a stunt double?

10 - Jackie Chan9 - Jackie Chan8 - Jackie Chan7 - Jackie Chan6 - Jackie Chan5 - Jackie Chan4 - Jackie Chan3 - Jackie Chan2 - Jackie Chan1 - Jackie Chan

I would have to ask about doing a top 10 on injuries from shooting the film pearl harbor&quot; unless that film was already done🤔..??

&quot;Get to hospital&quot; what was this recorded in england b/c that&#39;s  how they speak in england english &quot;it&#39;s  get to the hospital&quot; in united states english 🙄..!! SMFH..!!

Yeah Jackie&#39;s  good but I THINK JET LI MIGHT JUST GIVE HIM A RUN FOR HIS MONEY UNLESS THEY PERFORM A FDIFFERENT TYPE OF MARTIAL ARTS THAT&#39;S  THE ULTIMATE QUESTION🤔..??

What you say bout the rush hour movies?imma give this a dislike

Jesus that’s one of my biggest fears; not even the boy who cried wolf but the actress who cried good “acting”. Like ffs man how are people supposed to know you’re trying to signal if you’re literally in that specific role and in water it’s fucked they should have thought of some sort of signal like form a T with your hands but at least she got out.

Jackie Chan: Weaklings die, big deal

James Cameron says that they let Kate Winslet think she was going to drown and claims he knows what he&#39;s talking about because he&#39;s supposedly almost drowned more than once? alot of times, he does come across as an arrogant douchebag. and Jackie Chan should be number one on this list seeing how many times hes nearly died from his injuries.

Don’t think of Jackie Chan’s accident on set that almost killed him...think of him cross-dressing by wearing a Chun-Li costume!

Jackie Chan is king.

Dylan O&#39;Brien maybe??!! 😢

We don&#39;t see anything that actually happen in these it&#39;s just u mumbling

Legend says the outcry for jackie chan being number 1 on this list still echoes til this day.

Jackie survived all his near death stunts because he&#39;s got the Armor of God

During the filming of lone survivor they set off a mortar right next to mark wahlberg and it blew up in his face luckily he wasn’t injured you can check this in a video about the filming and marky Mark is the one who tells us this

That old spice power guy is terry from everybody hates Chris 😐

Hey WatchMojo..lots of love from IndiaWell...here we have Indian Superstar Amitabh Bachchan who almost died while shooting the action film &#39;Coolie&#39; (1983), but thank God, he survived...

You forgot Jim Caviezel from The Passion Of The Christ who almost died on set, by asphyxiation being on the cross, playing as Jesus!

Tom cruise

fuck Spielberg and fuck Star Wars and WatchMojo

Now u see me

Well where is amitabh bacchan he nearly died at the film of koolie

Jacky he is the best always the best

O,MH

When Dylan O’Brien hurt himself in a The Death Cure stunt.

Very terrible list. Almost as bad as that rush hour joke &amp; puting a fake swordsman over a real one.

<a href="">6:30</a> <b>JASON STATHAM</b>

I think number 10 is number 1 they have it in the opposite

well no Jackie Chan did not like doing rush hour 2 or 3 he said so himself he just did them simply because he felt he owed it to the fans

I came to see jackie chan, but you showed him a bit soon maybe, he did deadly stunts throughout his prime time, he almost faced death a couple few times, I don&#39;t think he deserves number 10 on list he should at least be 2nd or 3rd

daniel craig, you are forgetting daniel craig lost his four teeth while jumping from a crane scene in james bond casino royale.

Jackie chan should be no 1

Me: <b>Risks life to save a little child and gets shot 300 times in the chest and survives</b>Watch Mojo:Meh let&#39;s put him in Number 100

<i>The</i> <i>Cay</i> book is just like Cast Away

Video 11.11

Here’s an almost-killed-while-filming scene involving Sean Bean:Sharpe’s Regiment (1996)<a href="">

How about actor from Lone Survivor (Mark Wahlberg,Emile Hirsch,Taylor Kitsch and Ben Foster)

&quot;Could have been wounded&quot;......... sums up this !

I can&#39;t believe Mr Chan is number ten

Dominic purcell schould be in the list

Hi

like if baho ang besong

Jackie Chan: Hold My Beer.

Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, she drove that convertible car into a tree and was hurt, and I think to this day she blames Quinton for making her drive the car and not have a stuntman do it.  I forget which movie but Jackie Chan had this stunt where he was sliding off the edge of a roof, no rope or net. He actually almost feel off but grabbed the edge by a fraction of a second.  You seem him literally praying and thanking god as he was dead if he missed the grab, no chance it was like 20 stories fall.

On my oppinion Jackie Chan should have been on top and not Tom Cruise.

Y isn’t Jackie #1

It wasnt Kate in the stunt it was a stuntdubble they used cgi

i agree with the comments... jackie had many near death experiance... u shud have put him on number one, but i guess white is white, right????

Jackie Chan should be the first on the list .....No one comes close to him on almost dying making a movie ....

My life has changed and you can also get $6351 try this and you won&#39;t regret it <a href="">tlcpplcom.icu?/9MVT5C</a>

Dylan&#39;o brien almost died filming maze runner 3

Dude Chan has way more than anyone else

i have experince death before i was nearly drown at a hotel pool before my brother rescue me i was 6

You really put some thot falling down some stairs over Jackie Chan.

This is the biggest bs ever why tf is Jackie Chan at no.10

Jackie should not be on the list.He should have his own list.

JACKIE SHOULD&#39;VE BEEN FIRST

I knew Tom Cruise would be on one but I thought the movie would be MI 2

Actors who almost die what about are boys at sea no one gives a shit about the actors that almost dies

umm thats not how you say statham

Diane Kruger - Inglorious Basterds.

Wrong list. Jackie Chan is supposed to be number 1.  These guys suck at these list.

I didn&#39;t want to know how they nearly died, I wanna know how they died. LIKE THE TITLE

near death? no actually a broken arm

Jacky deserve top spot

That’s a Good Picture

Kit harrington for having on of his balls stuck in a machine in the game of throne set😂😂😂

I like how they&#39;re selling hoodies for 16 euros but why are the phone cases 22 euros?

Tom HanksPassed AwayHmmmm

you put someone who cut his hand 8 ranks higher than Jackie Chan??? don&#39;t get me wrong I like Tom Hanks, but damn! you put Jackie in last place!!!?? are you guys doing your research. Unsubbing for incompetence

I was thinking Jim Cavezial (sp?) would have made it for The Passion of athe Christ. He was at death&#39;s door because of what his body had to endure everyday just to get the film made.

Johny knoxville?Stev-o?Any of the jackass cast?

Jackie chan he broke fractured sprained bones I would put him in #1

The Titanic scene when they&#39;re running from the water was stunt doubles with the faces cgi&#39;d.You can totally tell in the blu-ray version.

this video is exactly <a href="">11:11</a>

Omg lol my mamaw use to say(I needed that, like I needed a hole  in my head) fuckin A! That made my day

Who was expecting a Fast and Furious clip

My step dad learnt how to dive with Jason stathen

Kate and Leo didn’t nearly die, it was supposed to be like that so that it makes the audience sit on the edge of their seats

Why is nobody mentioning the Jim Caviezel was struck by lightning during the filming of Passion of the Christ

what about Jason Statham in the meg

Jackie Chan is one of my favorite martial artists

If Kate Winslet died, then their would be no flushed away

Before watching this I’m guessing Tom Cruise is on this.

Tom cruise should be every pick.

Almost isn&#39;t good enough!

<a href="">0:39</a> you said we&#39;re discluding stuntsmen but Jackie chan is a stuntsmen

<a href="">11:11</a> let the magic happen

<a href="">10:43</a> no I do not agree with your list

Chan number 10? Are you serious? ?? Jackie is beyond comparison in this list.😂😂😂😂

That was Kate’s stunt double😂😂 they just projected her face on the stunt double

“We are not going to be including any stunt men” number 10, jackie chanB R U H

How did anyone dislike the Lone Ranger? That was a great movie

The jackass crew

Actualy only Jackie Chan can died in his movie 🤔

Anyone 2019

Top 2 things that made me scared of everything1st: last destination2nd: watchmojo

jackie chan praject A stunt

<a href="">#1SHOULD</a> BE JACKIE CHAN

i cannot decide whether this horse is stupid...or pretending to be stupidnot comedy gold but ok

Cruise looks like Oliver Queen at Lian Yu

J. F. Christ  are thesy trying to kill those people

Eli Wallach in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. After his character Tuco, escapes the train and uses another passing train to cut the handcuffs, he almost gets decapitated by one of the carriage&#39;s access steps.

Sword porn really

Bruce Lee&#39;s son died on set. There was a scene where je would get shot with a real gun that was supposed to be empty, only it was loaded and he actually got shot.

Now You See Me? That looks like Saw

You guys sound ridiculous, you dont want to show stunt doubles, cause they know what they are getting into, but you will show the big stars that want to do there own stunts.  The big stars know what they are getting into too so what are u guys talking about.  You mean you don&#39;t want to show the stunt doubles, cause they are not relevant and nobody cares about them, and people only care about famous people.  Just be honest

Come on, Jackie should be at the first place. This legend saw death on every set

Jackie should be on top of the list ,u guys know nothing about movies,and sets

Are u kidding me!? Why is Jackie Chan on the 10th spot!? Have u seen the scene in the movie &quot;Project A&quot; where he landed on his neck and head!?.. Jackie Chan deserved all the ten places 😒😒

I think y they list Jackie Chang no10 is that u have to see his failures first cos he nearly died in fact in rank no1



I almost had a near death experience from watching this list but I drank my Mojo!! Ha!!

Jackie Chan should have his own list...maybe every movie credit sorted 10 to 1 by closest  calls

10. Jackie Chan9. Jackie Chan8. Jackie Chan7. Jackie Chan6. Jackie Chan5. Jackie Chan4. Jackie Chan3. Jackie Chan2. Jackie Chan1. Jackie Chan

Jackie I like. But I.Fischer and Cruise, would the world have been a better place. No malice but money could have when to better cause(not sciencentogly, spell check plz).

Kate wasn&#39;t the one running from the wave..

Dayene Kruger (if it is wrote like this) strangelt by Quentin Tarantino in the scene before Aldo gets Arested.

Sly Stallone in cliffhangar

Who else thought they would show Jason

Flying skateboards? I assume you were going for hoverboards?

I still think Depp doesn&#39;t deserve all the hate in the world. I mean, he nearly got trampled after falling off his steed! Poor Depp, no one on this list deserves to die in general. Especially him.

<a href="">2:10</a> worst way/time/situation for people to misunderstand you ha.  i can believe they didnt have certain hand signals or codes

What about Mark Wahlberg? A mortar exploded 2 feet from his face when filming lone survivor.

When that rock fell from the RV he knew somewhere in one of the many many alternate dimensions he was killed by it.

Wow,  the early commenters were big Jackie Chan fans. Maybe you WatchMojo should do another list. That one should include Uma Thurman who nearly died in a runaway VW for Kill Bill. Cheers!

The passion of Christ actor Jim Caviezel almost died multiple time in the filming of the movie but you didn&#39;t mention it.

Maybe their talking about the best or most known actors

You’re so full of shit

Tom Cruise will die young.he thinks hes invincible. Rein it in Tom.

Kate Winslet&#39;s,oh what a shame.

HONESTLY JACKIE CHAN&#39;S NAME SHOULD BE AT 1ST

You guys are sooo stupid Jackie Chan should get an award for being the one with the most near death experience and hell no your list is so frickin wrong go redo it.

Jackie Chan should bhe first

Never say swordporn again...

Who are the people behind Mojo?Maybe 2 or 3 are brilliant researchers!You didn&#39;t include one French Film.

Stupid countdown!

Fuck u watch mojo. Are u kidding me? Jackie chan number 10? Do u mean this is list from level?? I can&#39;t believe it. I am start unsubscribe u. Fuck

Malcolm McDowell should have been on here during the filming of a clockwork orange. When the police officers try to drown him his oxygen mask failed and he very nearly died

The last jedia 🤔 hmmmmOhh the last samurai

Ridiculous Jackie Chan should be at no1

If you subscribe to me I subscribe to you

Love you statham from Pakistan

Jason statham ran off a dock bridge injuring 2 crew members NOT a cliff

Play video, skip to #1,no Jackie Chan! Crap list and disliked.

The expandables 3 terminator, Rambo, punisher, transporter and blade were in the same car.

I think number 4 should have been no. 1

Shouldn&#39;t Amitabh Bachchan be here

Who came for Jason Statham?

WILSON!!!! WILSON!!!!!!!!!

Why is almost everytging 10 fps

Jackie Chan has to be on this oh heck he was first

This was absolute bullshit!!Kmft

It doesn&#39;t surprise me that Tom Cruise almost died on set. Glad he didn&#39;t though.

2019????

You should just compiled top 10 near death experience by Jackie Chan! He is legend!

this is bullshit

At least Jason Statham wasnt expendable............................Im not sorry :D

<a href="">6:28</a> Jason statham is not pronounced how it looksWith the accent it sounds more like (sta - tem)

Oh I understand Tom Hanks could of died from a cut on his hand

Jackie chan only number 10??? he should be on top 5. probably number one.

&quot;I should have die many times before&quot;... quote Tom Cruise. Don&#39;t worry little boy, your time will come!

Is weird I have seen all of these movies except the honorable mentions

You just said excluding stunt men as they knew what they were sighing up for and the first one you show is Jackie Chan doing his own stunt there for who must have known what he was sighing up for

Are you kidding. Jackie has a hole in his head

Where is Sylvester stallone, his heart got knocked against his spine

Jacky is risky

So Tom Hanks is on there because he had an infected cut on his hand that &quot;could&quot; have poisoned his blood but  didn&#39;t...

What about the girl who acted as Jamie

Jackie Chan never die

Really Tom Cruise over JACKIE CHAN

Jackie chan has so many near death scene

Oh not Jason Statham

Tom Jane got thrown down a staircase in punnisher

Viggo Mortensen had not one but two near death experiences while filming LOTR and neither one was on the list??

Chan should have been number 1

Eli wallach was  almost killed 3 times during the filming of The Good, the bad and the ugly. Research it, though I can tell you if you ask.

No:1 is Jackie Chan

Another one that Tom Hanks almost died. The movie Angels &amp; Demons. He and another guy are stuck in a room without oxygen. Lucky he had a gun and tried to break the glass.

The Thing: When Kurt Russell tosses the dynamite at the Blair Thing, he didn&#39;t get clear.  For realism, John Carpenter used real dynamite.

Jackie Chan NO# 1. He is an IMMORTAL

You forgot “The Ugly” on the good the bad and the ugly almost got hung by a faulty prop rope accidentally drank acid on set horse ran off into the desert and was stranded out there for a very long time and was an inch away from being decapitated by a step on a train

Trought slits and drowning are the only things that really make me squeamish

Tom cruise is amazing but he&#39;s better when he&#39;s doing crazy stunts mission impossible

jackie chan needs to be on 1st rank and than tom cruse.... i think so

But fr hes 51!! HE LOOK LIKE HES IN HIS 30s!!!

Are you kidding me Tom cruise almost could have been killed this one time so he&#39;s on the list AND number one??!

Eli Wallach was almost decapitated by a train while filming &#39;The Good, the bad and the Ugly&#39;!!

I know Tom Cruise will be in this list

what a shit list

Wilson needs to be rescued!!!!

1-10 Jackie Chan

Bruh I knew the bow u see me 2 seen was real, like I was actually worried cause that scene looked entirely too real

What about Eli Wallach who was almost killed during the train scene in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly?

The rock acualy did a movie scene with REAL killer ants and those things can kill ya in one bite hell they can kill an elephant in one bite and the rock was covered in sand when shooting the scene and he almost died cuz of it

Almost...

Jackie chan will always be the legend of stunts and self taught martial artist

I knew it and I figured he would be #1 but I thought it would be for a mission impossible

I&#39;m commenting before watching the video I&#39;m guessing tom cruise is gonna be so n here

search youtube &quot; Coolie movie 1983: Amitabh Bachhan Highly Injured In that Scene:Old Hits&quot; He was in hospital after that scene

just watch the mentioned movies and make correct decisions

None of the above

Key Word: Stunt Doubles<b>USE THEM!!!!</b>

Why wasn’t Daniel Radcliffe’s backup here? he got paralysed for life for gods sake

Jackie Chan will be pissed if he sees this list.

Kit Harrington

Are you FUCKING serious Putting Jackie chan at 10.................... NONE of the others could measure up to near death experience he had.

The fact that it is called the last samurai you should assume there would be a lot of sword fighting

isla fisher- now you see me&quot;me: omg i remember that -.-

1 like= 1 paid respect[r.i.p paul walker]

Actually jackie chan must be the 1st he almost die for that its head injury noob list

Woahhhh why the shade at Rush hourThat film is sick

What about a new hope? The actor who played Greedo nearly choked to death in the mask

The punisher where Kevin Nah accidentally got stabbed

Bitch the rush hours are funny.. 🖕🏻

Mission impossible fallout, he almost died as he fell off the plane.

No Spoiler alert ?!!!

No person is ever hung. They can be hanged though.

Hi 👋

1: WHY were the swords sharp at all?

A new one:Dylan O&#39;Brien when a car came undone from the cables on set of maze runner: death cure.

James may almost died in top gear

That sword movie fits Keeanu Reeves better.

there is the one in Escape 2: Hades

Now you see me is insane!

These lists never seem to mention Patrick Swayze nearly getting killed while riding a horse in a movie- he ended up breaking both legs.

1-Jackie Chan

Jackie once had to get through multiple electric shocks while going down a an electric wire full of bulbs.

Jackie Chan police story

Jacky one

Lmao that protein joke :3

They take risks  in the name of acting;it Grace,mercy of God for this far to them

Jackie chan literally fell to his death and came back to life, how the fuck is he not number 1.

If Tom can survive not being murdered by socs, he can survive anything.....Oh wait....

Jackie Chan should be 1-10

anyone die from booty sex on set?

Does anyone remember the scene in The Phantom of The Opera where Roaul, played by Patrick Wilson, did a crazy little manuver, and jumped on a horse without a saddle?  I wonder if he almost died during the filming of that scene.

you forgot about johnny noxs ville

fuck you... rush hour sequels were great..

ironic she said Jason Statham swam to SHAW (only true Fast And Furious fans will understand lmao)

Left off another Tom Hanks. It was in the movie Philadelphia. It was told he almost died because of the weight loss he had to lose. Need a part two of this Top 10. Would love to see one come out. Just glad nobody was killed

Tom Cruise on 1?  This is Idiotic! If, then Chackie Chan should be on Place 1! We only should remember about own Stund doing Backrounds. Chan, because he wants that the Audience dont get joked on. That the Audience can see , what is true Possible and not Fantasy... . --- Cruise complete different. He is a known Scientologie Permanent Commercial. Same way as John Travolta. Only at Cruise, he is so much into that Believe, that he cares a shit about his own health. Goes so far, that even sometimes, Ensurence Companies reject to accept him as customer because of Stunts. And all only because of his Scientologie believe. ( 1 Example was a stund , where he was too close of possible loosing one of his Eye. He insisted on that stund, and more or less all companys rejected to make ensurence for that )

jackie the man who every  movie he made its a neardeath experience and have the record guiness for more stunts for a living actor  its 10 sigh

Bull shit! I immediately stopped watching when I heard &quot;number 10 Jackie Chan&quot;. What a bunch of crap!

Jim Caviezel!!!!!!

Hanged, not hung.

Cruise at #1, really!?

Aaron Paul&#39;s story was straight up butterfly effect.

I cut my head pretty bad when I was 10 but my mom took me to Urgent Care and had me stitched up within a couple hours; according to WatchMojo I could make this list.

I respect that Tom Cruise does his own stunts. But if you’re in a movie with lots of sword fighting, does how many times you ALMOST got sliced really come into it? Some of his costars probably did get hurt.

You forgot Bob Hoscings in super Mario Bros movie

Kane hidder Friday the 13th he got burned

I do kinda agree with everyone. I found out about at least 13 instances where Jackie Chan was injured on set. And more than just falling off the tree could have killed him.Also, maybe they should keep James Cameron away from water. Add that to a list of things James Cameron should avoid, including sinking boats and former television hosts who might be mad that Cameron called them &quot;piles of s***&quot;.

the actor who played Arragorn? you gave him a nod, but in the first LotR movie he had an actual dagger lobbed at his head, and he had to deflect it with a prop sword. when watching the movie, you can actually see several shards of the blade go flying as a result of the deflection

Easy math:       #10    &gt;     #1+#2+#3+#4+#5+#6+#7+#8+#9

Richard Kiel AS Jaws

Agreed Jackie Chan should be NO.1

Yeah I guess if you almost drown on multiple occasions that you must be a professional dumbass that cant swin in an inch of water lol... Maybe take sum swimming lessons damn dude or stay away from water cause you obviously pissed Poseidon off something fierce 😂

Oh shit nigga

Statham? What was deadly dangerous for the diver in that situation?

Whitesnake

that must&#39;ve been so scary for the one in Now You See Me and for Kate Winslet

<a href="">5:52</a>

Jackie chan Isla fisher Kate WinsletJaimie Alexander Michael j fox Johnny deppJason stathamAaron Paul Tom Hank Halle berry Joseph Gordon Brendan Fraser Jennifer Lawrence Michael fogTom cruise 

First off, what the hell is sword porn?

You Guys Are Liars................Titanic  was Fucking Shot In A POOL!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jackie chan should be at first

And you forget The Rock

I knew Jackie Chan was in it

How about viggo morteson barely deflecting the hurled dagger on set?

Jackie Chan should be number 1

No wonder why there are rumours that Jackie is dead

nice

Jackie Chan - number 1!

these guys know their movies i.ll give &#39;em that. however i do not agree with depp making a wrong choice with loneranger, i mean his character is the only thing saving the movie he.s great at it

Great list, but a cut on the hand just doesn&#39;t seem to be worse than sever back injuries or HOLE in the skull. Enjoyed the video though, thank you.RDA91AVFC

Jackie Chan in every fucking movie :D

spartacas

Please like this comment

My fav was the one of Kate winslet on the titanic set

jackie should be 1 to 10

Jason Statham is the real action star

putting jackie chan on no. 10 is pretty stupid, but that &quot;brain damage&quot; joke/dig is fucking insulting.

I loved the Lone Ranger tho

most foolish human research on this topic

Jackie chan number 1 stunt man in the world.

all of them

Halle Berry. She banged her head on concerte and broke her arm while filming &quot;Catwoman&quot;

jackie chan won&#39;t be on the list because he&#39;s number no 1 nobody i mean nobody replace him.

what about sly stallone and his broken neck?

Vigo Mortenson deflecting a REAL dagger being thrown at him

Jakie chan  needed to be on 1st

WORST WORST WORST LIST EVER, seriously??? JACKIE CHAN, The Legendary JACKIE CHAN @ number10? quit posting bro, JACKIE CHAN deserves more than this other actors,

God Is Really Watching Thease Actor&#39;s Big Time,  I&#39;m So Glad That They Still Alive Thank You Lord

Jackie Should be in number 1

if it has anything to do with stunts, Jackie Chan will be somewhere on the list.

Johnny Depp IS NOT A HIPSTER !!!!

Wtf? did you really call him the &quot;old spice power guy?&quot;

directors should set some signal or any sign if the actor is seriously in danger or not ..

no

Jackie deserved top place

sullivan stapleton hit his head during filming on tv show strike back and he was in the hospital which cause the fifth and final season to be delayed for couple of months. You can see the scar on strike back and on blindspot!!

in the first Rambo movie.....Silvester Stallone almost die in the mountain from the jump scene.......

Isla Fisher could&#39;ve been #1

Thumbs down for Cruise being number one for a near miss, while Jackie Chan comes in at the bottom of the list for falling nearly 20 feet and almost cracking his skull wide open.  C&#39;mon Mojo....

Meryl Streep in Into The Woods,Kevin Costner in Waterworld,Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 2,Dylan O`Brian in The Maze Runner: The Death Cure,Daniel Craig in Spectre and Robert Pattinson in Twilight.

Jennifer Lawrence in Hunger Games Mockingjay part 1, Dylan O&#39;Brien in Maze Runner The Death Cure

Why jackey Chan number 10 ? And another Movie like a peace of shit ?

I LOVE back to the future!

when actor and actress r in the water are any complication (stunt) full action should be giving and preparation to rescue them

it should be acting not real

I HATE piranhas!

Amitabh Bachchan,  in film Coolie in 1982 before all this actor did their stunts...  He was punched in the stomach for real..though he was hit by mistake.. But the injury was so deep that he was hospitalized and nearly died if the operation didn&#39;t take place on time...  He should have been mentioned..  Please make your list thinking globally...

i don&#39;t agree... First is JACKIE CHAN....

Jackie Chan should be number one😨😨

Jackie Chan should&#39;ve been in 1st place.

Clint Eastwood was almost hit by a chunk of flying debris in The good, the bad, and the ugly. When they blow the bridge, a big piece smacks into the sandbag to his right. You can see it in the movie.

Don&#39;t worry about Jason Statham. If he fucks up a stunt on set he just Navy Seals his way out of that shit.

Clicked on the video cuz of sexy Jason Statham on thumbnail. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Jackie Chan actually got his skull crushed and only in 10th place? And his near death experience are far more then 10. The only correct thing about this is that it is his worst injury.

Why did tom Cruise keep shooting if his life was almost taken twice .

You don&#39;t have to say Top 10 all the timeYou just say &quot;10 actors who almost died on set&quot;

Eli Wallach (as Tuco) was almost killed 3 times during the making of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:  He accidentally drank from a bottle of acid instead of a bottle of pop; he was almost decapitated by the metal steps jutting out from the freight cars on a train; during a hanging scene, the horse he was on bolted and ran a mile with him on it, his hands tied behind him!  Should have made the list, but...

Isla Fisher:I am here if you need a shoulder (or lap) to cry on.:)

Was thinking that Winona Ryder almost drowning during Alien Resurrection was going to be on the list.

what about that Jim Caveisel(not sure how to spell) guy? didn&#39;t he go through the ringer in The Passion?

70 instances where Tom Cruise could have died... if there were only 71

Although the Rush Hour movies may not be cinematic legend it was a okay comedy and broadened Jackie&#39;s appeal in US markets. Before Rush Hour few knew who Jackie was (though anyone who watched martial arts movies was well versed). To suggest Brain Damage = Rush Hour Sequels... F@#^ You! 15 Mil is plenty of reason (RH2). Hell he couldn&#39;t speak English but was getting top $. Also as you suggested not counting stunt doubles, that was exactly Jackie&#39;s start so he DID go into the profession knowing exactly what he signed up for. Just bad-ass enough to continue!

Did anyone else click on the video because the time was <a href="">11:11</a>

And this is the problem with Watchmojo. They mention Kate Winslet&#39;s alleged near drowning incident and even mention that James Cameron has nearly drowned himself and they ask why that is. 5 minutes of research would have told you that most of those instances were while filming The Abyss, where not only Cameron almost drowned, but lead actor Ed Harris almost drowned and refuses to talk about the shooting of that movie even to this day. This was not a case of a dress getting caught in a door and spending half a minute submerged, this was a case of being under 40 feet of water, with the guy that&#39;s supposed to give you oxygen getting stuck far away from you. Would have made for a much more interesting list, but sadly The Abyss is not as popular as Titanic and these list are a popularity contest after all.

ahhh Richard Hammond for crashing a hypercar? no? nobody? really...?

I honestly (aside from &quot;Legend&quot; cannot watch ANY Tom Lose movie. He&#39;s just so dumb!

I think Tom Cruise in anything past &quot;LEGEND&quot; means he&#39;s an Oprah Couch Jumping Xenu piece of pious crud-bubbles.

Everything I have ever heard about James Cameron makes me think he is a monumental dickhead.

check my channel

johnny depp is wherein the demon balor entrance attire

What about Vigo Mortenson in two towers?And the  horseman that was almost trampled to death when his saddle became loose, causing him to fall off his horse during the ride of the Rohirim in Return of the King.

Ed Harris actually almost drowning in &quot;The Abyss&quot;. Nuff said.

Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines - During a scene where a tank fires at him, he was pulled back by a cable tied around his waist to mimic being thrown from the explosion of the shell, but during one instance the cable almost was pulled in time and he was almost killed by the blast.

The list was spot on, but Jackie Chan should have been at the top of the list, not the bottom. The has at least 1 near-death experience per movie.

I love The Lone Ranger but Depp&#39;s movie sucked.

Directors are sick.

it&#39;s pleasant how you add scenes of the actors from different movies as expressions

Jennifer Lawrence choked on fog machine fog?

Odd to choose there also interesting

This list&#39;s priorities are confused. You have a few <b>legitimate injuries</b>, some very serious, yet a coulda-but-didn&#39;t-happen death/injury came out on top.  What even? Just because he could&#39;ve died many different times in many different ways doesn&#39;t make it worthy of mentioning, much less the #1 spot.

I can only imagine how the stunt doubles are/still alive doing the extreme

If this was a 2016 video and included stunt doubles , it would have included Mila Jovavitch&#39;s stunt double landing into a coma for 2 weeks due to ramming into a camera crane on a motorcycle, also removing multiple nerves from her spine in the process

I agree with everyone who says that Jackie Chan should be No 1 &amp; I bet the people who are on this list would agree too.

this video is 1111 long

Where is Jim Caviezel from The Pasion??

Jackie Chan could have an entire list of the times he nearly died on set.

this list is dumb. it should be all................................ jackie chan in this list .-.

jim caviezel in passion of the christ.

Dude wtf? You leave out Bob Hoskins in Super Mario Bros?!  He barely survived that movie!

i think that nr. 1 is Jackie Chan

<b>Sword porn?? :O</b>

jackie chan should be #1 come on really....

Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible when he hangs on to a plane

was Stallone not actually hit by Lundgren while filming Rocky? (not sure which one) like he went to the hospital

how is Jackie Chan at number 10 :/ like he fell OVER 16 feet and got bone into his brain :/

hey man, i enjoyed the rush hour sequels

They forgot Dylan obrian

Jason Statham didn&#39;t see that as a near death experience because he does crazy, awesome stuff all the time in movies

Stop with the jokes, the Rush Hour sequels joke wasn&#39;t funny at all

Dillon Orian

Are these actors idiots

What about ben-hur?

Jackie Chan should&#39;ve been on top 1!

Man, they really need to improve movie hangings :)

haha watchmojo still hasn&#39;t found all the hacked titles :)

am i the only one who sees hack by a pozoecorp

<b>WHY THE HELL ARE THEY HANGING ACTORS FOR REAL?</b> Jesus Christ. Especially the one with Brendan Fraser! Like, what the actual fuck?! They need to make some sort of vest that goes around their torso and connects to the noose so that the <b>ACTOR DOESN&#39;T ACTUALLY GET HANGED.</b>

If Jason Statham died while filming that movie, I guess you could say was really....... Expendable. Ahahahaha heheeeee..... I&#39;ll show myself out.

<b>Gasps</b> ODO I&#39;M SHOCKED!!!!!!

<b>sigh</b> To think, we could have been rid of the plague of Depp forever...

Rush Hour is dope! Wtf??

This bitch always says welcome to watch <a href="">mojo.com</a> but who the fuck watches on <a href="">watchmojo.com</a>

jackie chan got his skull hammered into his brain n had a narrow escape from brain damage &amp; even death .. 16 feet fall from a branch n had his head knocked onto a stone and the others merely had narrow escape without much damage cost.

Jennifer Lawrence also almost died while filming Mockingjay Part 2

she insulted rush hour? I don&#39;t understand. WHY??????

WHY are this videos so adicting? :&#39;v its <a href="">2:00</a>am and im still watching

Martin Sheen had a heart attack on the set of Apocalypse Now = Honorable MentionTom Cruise ran the risk of maybe possibly being injured while filming a stunt with swords = #1That makes sense....

u know ALMOST

lol

lol

Brandon Lee almost made this list.

Tom Cruise = Legend

&quot;The old spice guy&quot;so, that&#39;s how his reputation is already done

What about tom cruise and the airplane in mission impossible

old spice guy.

Jackie Chan is my hero :)

this is such bs

... Where is the actor who played that guy in singing in the rain? He got pneumonia and nearly died because of the singing in the rain scene

#7 Johnny DAB!

The world´s sexiest hipster. I´d never thought of calling him that, but it so fits :D:D.

Jason Statham Badass in movies and RL

The one from now you see me was honestly so dumb. They should have taken the right precaution JUST IN CASE, with a warning sign or something.

¿&quot;Tuvo la chance&quot;? Que alguien enseñe a los latinos que la palabra &quot;oportunidad&quot; existe.

Technically, it&#39;s &#39;hanged&#39;. Not &#39;Hung&#39;

Did they leave out Buster Keaton because he was kind of asking for it? I mean, even Harold Lloyd climbed a tall building even though he had lost fingers after he had a bomb go off in his hand, but Buster, well... along with all his other insane stunts including one that cracked a vertebra, he once fell from the top of a freaking building! He should have at least made the list and I&#39;d have expected him or Jackie Chan to top it. What beats having your skull caved in for crying out loud?

i liked number6

seriously Jackie Chan number 10. it&#39;s just wrong.when you fall down and smash you head into a rock and have need to have plastic in you skull and stil survive. Then you&#39;re number 1 on the list

Harrison Ford in The Force Awakens

Add one of my favs to the list now. Dylan O&#39;Brien was struck by a vehicle on the set of Maze Runner 2. He&#39;s still recovering 2 months later.  Get well soon, Dylan!  xoxo

Ok, so do we REALLY believe they used anything but dull swords in the sword fights with Tom Cruise? REALLY?

wow, just wow no mention on how Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, and Linda Hamilton nearly died ALOT in Terminator 2, seriously they almost died like twenty times, first when they shot the seen when cops were firing at them at Skynet, then when they were shooting at the T-1000, and MANY MANY MANY other times in Terminator 2

Nwice

my near death experience caught my attention

What about the guy from the passion of the christ

Hangings, near death drownings and falls. No movie magic there! Wow!

I will someday be an actress

How about when the guy who plays lurtz in lotr actually threw a knife at arogon but the actor hit it with his sword

When i was watching Back to the Future 3 my dad told me the story of the hanging incident.

Charlie Chaplin could&#39;ve died in the lion cage, he was feet away from an actual lion

I love Jacky Chan glad he is ok

At the end of the video you could have made a tribute to Brandon Lee who <b>DID</b> die on set...

Jackie Chan got hurt badly and almost died, but is in the 10th place, while others had narrow escapes.

In the Wizard of Oz, the guy who was originally cast as tinman was poisoned by the paint they used. There was aluminum in the paint. He was in the hospital for so long that they had to re-cast tinman. He survived though. He went on to play Paw in the Beverly Hillbillies

they should just agree on a sign for when they really are drowning.

Ed Harris to this day is still upset with James Cameron for almost letting him drown during filming of the scene where he and Mary Elizabeth Manstrotanio were stuck in the submersible when the water started rising inside the sub in the movie THE ABYSS. James Cameron said he wanted the scene to show more realism before rescuing Ed Harris.

Jim Caviezel during filming of the Passion of the Christ

Jim Caviezel was reportedly struck by lightning on the set of The Passion of the Christ...

Kevin Costner, Waterworld?

11. Paul walker

Sean Connery almost die on set when he was filming the falling helicopter scene on film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963).

What about Brandon Lee in The Crow? Oh wait, nvm, he did die.

See Tom even said in the Movie He should of died many times. Glad he did not.

by your own perimeters for the list. Tom Curse should not have made the list for last samurai. He knew what he was getting himself into.

all these good likable people almost died doing their worst movies...wtf

It&#39;s so satisfying that the video is <a href="">11:11</a>

lady sith appeared in agents of shield around s1 episode 15 to 20 somewhere there i don&#39;t remember

&#39;this list excludes stuntmen as thats their jobs&#39;number 1 - Tom Cruise - the actor who does his own stunts :I

&quot;Jack&quot; a B-Grade short horror movie that I played the role of the killer for in 2000 would take out number one! One of the female victims tripped on cabling running across the floor of the green screen and fell forward onto the knife I was holding in front of her throat. She received a small cut on her throat, shut filming down for close to a week.

Paul Walker hurt so bad he died

Ok, Jackie is maybe nr. 10, by at least in 10 times more movies. :D

Ed Harris in The Abyss almost drowned...

I&#39;m sorry, did you just talk shit on rush hour 2 . . . .

Too bad Jason Statham didn&#39;t die.

What about Leonardo DiCaprio in The Beach? I had heard that he almost drowned. I think it was that movie.

Why such hate for the Lone Ranger?

This list is very sloppy. Many of the top ones were not even life threatening and were &quot;Could have happened&quot; I want to know things that really did happen!

Action movie

That was intense!

Honorable mentions are a lot painful to watch than the ones in top. Like wtf the top choices are really idiotic except some of em but wtf honorable mentions should be on top choices

Ray Winstone was almost struck and killed by a giant boulder when filming &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; but his reaction was so good that the director decided to keep it in the film.

number 9 omg

I was waiting for them to say they actually left Tom Hanks on the island by himswlf

the experience that  caught my eye was the one where that person almost died

i can&#39;t they do that like real in &#39;&#39;The Mummy&#39;&#39; because i been watch without realize it

There were two guardian angels watched over Kate Winslet and Jason Statham

Go away evil dogger

Jackie and cruise need to work together already damnit

Matthew Fox stabbed during Lost?

what about vic morrow

Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Spielberg himself announced that the film was stopped for a month because Ford suffered from a fracture in a fighting scene inside the temple.

muy ,interesante,el,reportaje de estos actores y la disciplina,q tienen en acer estas,peliculas

no offence but he was a white guy playing a native

None

That&#39;s an odd way to say &quot;hooves&quot;

how about Eli Wallach in the good, the bad and the ugly. he should be number 1.

WILSON

Jennifer Lawrence choked on fog... I&#39;m having trouble seeing that. I know the chemistry, but damn, you have time to move and breathe elsewhere. I like her as an actress but I really hope she wasn&#39;t trying to steal attention away at the time. Really I hope it was for the best: film, product, reality. Just seems off...

Excuse me.. But the &quot;RUSH HOUR MOVIES&quot; we&#39;re pretty good!

Jackie Chan of course👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Heart attack, going through the wind shield of a car and nearly snapping your neck from being hung vs infected cut...and first the first three are the honourable mentions? Really?!! Smh

this is all modern actors-this site is shit

Harold Llyod lost fingers- ever seen the ROAR (1981)-thats CRAZY!

what about when a punch from Dolph Lundgren caused Sylvester Stalone&#39;s heart to stop momentarily during the filming of Rocky 4

26,26,26 aramjДже

how did jackie chans skull being bashed into his brain lose to tom cruise standing next to his grandma while she was chopping vegetables??? watch mojo is trash...

Tom Cruise almost getting hurt should not be number one. Viggo Mortenson really did get seriously hurt, but only gets a passing nod? This list isn&#39;t up to snuff WatchMojo.

fuck u all

Hey , I liked the Long Ranger !

Hi

makes me wonder what is actually fake in movies

now you see me

now you see me

They should have had Eli Wallach, who nearly died on the set of The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. The horse his character was being hanged on ran off with him tied up on top of it. Somehow he stayed aboard with his hands tied.

jackie chan doesn&#39;t count because he&#39;s a stuntman who does his own acting.

The old spice guy!? That&#39;s Terry Crews you hacks!

wow wow .. nope Jackie chan is 1st for this you did a wrong thing

since #1 was working with professionals, switch him with jackie. Or add Jackies incodent of him having to fall off the helicopter into the ice and then falling through it again..

Eli Wallach in The Good The Bad and The Ugly??

Viggo Mortensen in Fellowship of the Ring. In the scene where the orc Lurtz throws a dagger at Aragorn, a real dagger was used, and due to the armor he was wearing restricting his movement, the guy playing Lurtz accidentally threw it directly at Viggo instead of the tree next to him. Viggo managed to deflect it, but seriously, what were they thinking using a real dagger?!

They don&#39;t need to stairlifts, she should probably just skip the high heels.

isla fisher voice ugghhh

It wasn´t a skateboard, it was a hoverboard, duh.

old spice actor, Rambo, Johnny Hurt his career for staring in a kids movie...you are disrespectful and rude...say whatever you like on your mojo shit but be respectful..they are artists you&#39;re nothing if you respect nothing

I don&#39;t get it, someone who gets a small cut isnumber two, someone who breaks his skull and get a pice of it stuck into his brain is number 10.Okay.

Jackie Chan should&#39;ve been number1

Talking about from the video

Agreed👌🏾😍😍😍😍👍🏾

Jackie chan 1000 ways to almost die

<a href="">9:21</a> I believe the term is hung

Omg if Johnny depp died..😭😭😭😭😭 I would literally never leave my house again!

What about the guy who played Jesus in Passion of the Christ? I heard he went through all kinds of dangerous situations during filming.

No mention of James Cameron <i>wanting</i> Kate Winslet to think she was in danger of drowning??

god :O

George Clooney fell off a chair while filming Syriana and hurt himself so badly that he started sneezing spinal fluid. apparently the pain was so terrible while he was in recovery that he seriously considered killing himself :o

It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio was the one who almost drowned

only Jackie chan and martain sheen really quailify

I think Jackie Chan having pieces of his skull pushed in his brain,, with a lasting hole filled with a plastic plug should have given him the number 1 spot. Anyone else with me on that?

i feel Jackie should have been a little higher on the list lol

burt Reynolds- Deliverance

Can u make another video of this and include Harrison ford breaking his back on the set of Star Wars the force awakens

Jennifer Lawrence choked on fog. Gas. She literally choked on air.

No Lou Diamond Phillips? Wow.

They get paid real well so that&#39;s da risk they take for money..

Willem Dafoe get Yellow Fever during &quot;Platoon&quot; acting. He was in delirium for 24 hours.

I like how the time for this is <a href="">11:11</a> (number of death)

Statham was a professional diver well before he went into action films. Could have been a life saver on Expendables III

The narrator is an idiot

What backgrund music is that?Sounds funky.

ummmm

Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. When the interrogation his head was smashed into a concrete corner and almost getting hit by the BatPod.

WHY JOHNNY DEPP!?!

Remind us never to take up acting... &#39;Cause it almost cost these actors their lives#MMM_RB

i laughed soooo much when it came up with martin sheen heart attack on apocalypse now right after &quot;jennifer lawrence chokes on fog machine&quot; hahah anyone seen heart of darkness? hahahahaa

I DONT UNDERSTAND...ALL of these clips are from movies....Which means there were cameras during EVERYONES incidents...So why are we only seeing glimpses of the movies where they almost died?I want to see the MOMENT they almost died, not hear people TALK about it.

your lists are good but your personal opinion commentaries are stupid

Woah. Time out. I can no longer trust this channels opinions, The rush hour sequels were the shit#MMM_Communit: <a href="">#MMMGlobal</a>

Woah. Time out. I can no longer trust this channels opinions, The rush hour sequels were the shit <a href="">#MMMExtra</a>

LMAO so hard at Cruise&#39;s &quot;I should&#39;ve died so many times more&quot; line and when it lands during the video.

Rly? Jackie Chan that got his skull crushed by a rock is number 10...and Tom Cruise that got some swords swinging to close to his neck is number one? Like ....seriously? He shouldn&#39;t be in a list at all, and Jackie should&#39;ve got 1st place.

Woah. Time out. I can no longer trust this channels opinions, The rush hour sequels were the shit#MMM_Community <a href="">#MMM_Pays</a> <a href="">#MMMRB</a>

Wtf was wrong with Rush Hour 2 and 3?!

jackie chan should be 2nd

damn

Now make video top 10 actors that DIED on set :D

ackie Chan fell from like 10 meters or something on his neck... Not only that, he has been injured many times before. He shold be number one! Mojo you gotta add a label on the number one spot saying sorry for your choise and that Jackie Chan should have been there! :P <a href="">#Mavro</a>

I&#39;m glad they survived, especially Jennifer Lawrence.

Whats the name og the background beat??

<a href="">04:43</a> Michael J Fucks

Tom Hanks is Awesome.

NO ONE DIED OF THEM! <b>Jesus Christ</b>

&quot;We&#39;re excluding brave stuntmen...&quot;Starts with fucking Jackie Chan

WHAT? jackie chan number 10 jackie chan should be number 1

THE FUCKS WRONG WITH RUSH HOUR :@

I was standing right next to the road and a car passed me 60 km/h,  Jesus, I could have died if I took another inch and ended up on Mojo&#39;s top 10.

lols at the very rare, and most amusing incident of an american using the word &quot;Bloke&quot; (8.20)

no bob hoskins?

can you do Top 10 Actors Who  Died on Set

Not even an honorable mention for Gregory Peck in 1956&#39;s Moby Dick? He nearly drowned when the &quot;whale&quot; he was tied on went underwater... Gossip says, he hated director John Huston for the rest of his life...

possible and impossible anyway GOD rise sun to every person

Jim Caviezel in The Passion Of The Christ. There were several instances where he was injured on set and continued filming. He was also struck by lightning and almost died of pneumonia because he continued to film while still sick. That&#39;s what I call near death experience. Not like half of what was listed here

How about Jerry Lewis in Cinderfella and how he nearly died at the top of the stairs leaving the ball?

Add to that Ben Hur

Too numerous to count serious injuries on Bruce Lee Kung Fu movies.

Fuck you rush hour trilogy was hilarious.

Didn&#39;t Charlize Theron injure her spine badly while making &quot;AEon Flux&quot;?

Actually jacki chan had more worse injuries so he should come no 1

Hank cutting his hand ? Almost dying on set ? Are you serious to make nr 2 ?

Guys/Girls: you ok Jackie, Jackie you ok?Jackie: Jackie always ok.

WHOA WHOA WHOA I DIDN&#39;T EXPECT MICHEAL

Rambo? to me, that&#39;s Rocky Balboa.

I&#39;m so confused as to why there was a boulder on the roof of the rv?

&quot;We&#39;ve excluded brave stunt doubles, as they&#39;ve gone into the profession knowing what they signed up for&quot;Immediately starts talking about Jackie Chan. Right.

How is this ranked?

Jason Statham didn&#39;t fall in the sea during a stunt. The car was on 1st gear and he didn&#39;t push the clutch (at all or enough) while starting it. Unfortunately for the &quot;experienced&quot; driver the car was parked near the edge facing the sea so it fell off. Good thing the doors were removed and he escaped fast. I know this because it was filmed in my home city Varna, Bulgaria.

video is <a href="">11:11</a> illuminati confirmed

I cannot decide if this horse is stupid or pretending to be stupid LOL HAHA

WAIT.. wtf.. when i looked at this vid b4 i clicked it i was like... maybe tom cruise is on thisMe l8er: Dafuq?

How the heck is Jackie Chan 10? He almost died over like 10 Times on set he should be number 1 in my opinion

Watchmojo is the most shitty channel of all. They just put some stupid arrangement with numbers to trigger people start commenting and discussing. This is no real service to the cinematrographic knowledge, it&#39;s a way to create viral videos. Total BS.

BLood poisoning? Come on  it could cause blood poisoning, not he had blood poisoning.   THis  video is really stretching.

Today, I have to register with Global. MMM. I feel good. I am confident. I think he can be good. please contact me,interest of 100% is rea  <a href="">#HashTags</a>: null

Jackie chan is not first? Who the hell made this list?

I love jackie chan

Yes

Holly crap, if Jason died who would be the main villain in Fast &amp; Furious 7???

Have just 35698452 scrub no. Joke xd

Nice video! Caen you pels scriba me xd

Actor Jim Caviezel struck by lightning while filming &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;.

Buster Keaton

There is this Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan who also almost died on set of a film. It was near fatal too..

Jackie Chan number 10, skip to see Cruise at number 1, not even going to bother

Deez nuts

I&#39;m surprised that Jackie Chan hit the 10th spot. And what about Bruce Willis?

Piranhas are NOT carnivores, they are scavengers!

Truth: We&#39;ve excluded brave stunt doubles..... because no one cares about them.

What the fuck was a BOULDER doing on top of the RV in Breaking Bad????

hahahaha.. TOP 10 &quot;ACTORS&quot;.... ?

Paintings are hung.People are hanged.

Ohhhhhhhhh armour of God that was good

Pff, i should be number one, i hit my toe on a rock on an rv

was gonna mention Brandon Lee, but that&#39;s none of my business...

The reason Jamie Alexander hurt herself so bad, is because WOMEN shouldn&#39;t do action. It&#39;s so unrealistic. They&#39;re weak and soft.

The fact that Jason Statham made the thumbnail is enough for me.

Not Actors but the stunt men

I had no idea acting was so dangerous. I thought they were just good at making it look dangerous.

PLEASE ALL WHO WANTS! Send a comment on what near death experiences you&#39;ve had? :) I once landed on my neck when doing a &#39;Gymnastic flip&#39;. The second time I was walking on icy cliffs with a girlfriend I had. Suddenly slipped right at the edge but I grabbed a small tree in the last second, caught it wrong somehow so my shoulder got dislokated haha! But if that hadn&#39;t happened, my body wouldn&#39;t have spinned around from back to stomach so I could get a grip on the cliff edge and get the sliding to stop in the right moment. Was about 10cm from the edge.

i knew isla would be there,just look at that scene tho

Sylvester Stallone should&#39;ve been in here from rocky IV when Dolphins Lundgren hit him and stopped his heart

11seconds 11mins and 11million people watched this illuminati confirmed

How the hell did cruise get #1 are you kidding me. almost any of the other are closer to death than that. what B.S. propaganda for the Scientology God

A horse would never step on someone. Unless they really cant help it, like if Johnny Depp would have been between his/ her hooves for longer and the horse continues to canter, then it would have been...bad. If you look closely, you could see that the horse jumped over him:-)

jasons a boss

v.v.

This channel speaks to naive people who live under rocks.

No 1080p? really? It&#39;s 2016 step up

Leo better win an Oscar for his near death experiences in The Revenant. He ate raw meat, jumped into the freezing river, and slept in a dead animal.

the tom cruise one is BS, they don&#39;t actually use real swords when filming do they? If so than there are some dumb MFers in this world

pfft, most of these are like well if this happened instead of this they COULD have been seriously hurt or killed. Meanwhile number 10 is a guy falling 16feet and cracking his head on a rock pushing part of his skull into his brain... terrible list.

drowning is one of the worst ways to go

Lightning struck Jim Caviezel on Passion of the Christ.. It should be there yea..

why was there a boulder on top of the rv

They forgot Rambo

Haha Jennifer Lawrence &quot;choking on fog machines fog&quot;

Jackie Chan should&#39;ve easily been on all of the 10 positions, but that wouldn&#39;t be fair, but yet again not being no. 1 in the list it isn&#39;t fair either

Jackie can should be in 10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2 and 1 place 😅

Do you guys honestly think they use sharpened swords in movies..There is no way that could be number 1.Jacky Chan or Jason Statham were far worse.

... I&#39;ve ell off my horse and it did step on me, and I&#39;m still here. I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t have killed him.

No offense but where do you get your information?

WE  WANT MORE BRUCE LEE

1111

for the Isla Fischer one, maybe a distinguished hand signal woulda done the trick

there is no doubt that Jackie chan should be number one

Jackie Chan stunt in a mall that hung on lights and almost got electrocuted to death

Lol yeah wtf was with that rush hour line XD

...11. Schwarzenegger almost died on the set of the film, when a horse he was riding during one of the film’s most memorable action sequences got spooked by a camera boom and started rearing up near the edge of a very steep drop (the actor estimates it was about 90 feet to the ground). Arnold managed to slip off the horse in time, and a stunt man pulled him to safety.

im pretty sure arnold almost died during the filming of true lies also when the horse almost ran off the top of the building while he was on the back of it

it&#39;s sad that in the &quot;honorable mentions&quot; we don&#39;t really get to know the story behind... when it&#39;s just a list of good or bad actors it works just to see the names but in this video the main thing is to know the events...so I am a little frustrated.. hehe

I am going to say #1 should be the last samurai but I would give it to the extra that got kicked in the nuts by a horse.

Jason Statham should get an honorable mention even though it happened after this video was put together when he almost drowned when his vehicle he was riding in fell off a bridge when filming Expendables.

This one time, I was walking down the street, and a car almost hit me. It came, like, 3 feet from me. Man, that was close. This other time, I was walking down the street at night, and I was drunk, and I walked into a wall...

None of these even comes close to a near death experience. And Depp didn&#39;t nearly get trampled. Horses WILL NOT step on a human being (scientific fact) unless they are trained to do so, or are entirely unable to avoid it. If you watch close, you&#39;ll see the horse intentionally change his canter to skip over Depp and avoid hurting him. Nearly dying? No, just a dumb guy falling off a smart horse...

Jackie Chan should be on all places in this countdown...

han solo didn&#39;t almost die, he did die

come on u missed amitabh bacchan he went to coma for doing a stunt

Vigo Mortensen, LotR: TFoR - Lurtz hurls a dagger at Aragorn by accident and Vigo breaks it with his sword.

Two lists and no mention of Lou Diamond Phillips who was almost drug to death by a noose around his neck tied to his saddle while filming Young Guns I I?  The noose hadn&#39;t been sheared in the back, which is a safety precaution, and during some shooting the horse he was on bolted, throwing him off, but the other end of his noose was tied to his saddle horn. The horse drug him through an entire movie set, busting his knee and breaking his arm on top of almost strangling him to death, before he finally got free.  It&#39;s because of that they later put in the arm stabbing scene, because Phillips really was wearing a cast. But a near miss from a Katana and an infection make the list? OK....

Seriously style people were right! WatchMojo sucks. They don&#39;t work hard. The worst accident it&#39;s of Jackie Chan who fell from a tree and something went inside his brain. Most of the people know that.WatchMojo doesn&#39;t work hard. Simply compiling list.Bullshit!

This stressed me out..

Haha back to the future

One that was missed was Scott Glen in &quot;Backdraft&quot; although it was not on camera, during the scene in which he and Kurt Russell are hanging 15 feet off the ground, and on fire, Scott&#39;s fireproof equipment once failed during a take, but the crew had the hoses on just as he gave the signal to indicate something was wrong

the prona

&quot;I should have died many times&quot; Tom Cruise, Sounds like he did that alot in Edge of tommorow

FILM SETS CAN BE DANGEROUS TAKE CARE

nice

WILSON!!!

I can&#39;t remember the actor, but there was the original scene (black and white film) where the front of a house fell down and the actor passed through the window, but the edge of the window almost hit his arm and nearly took it off. I know it&#39;s not technically nearly dying, but this video just reminded me of the scene.

amazing....who knew!

How about Clint Eastwood in the good, the bad and ugly? At the fight at the bridge some shrapnel comes flying just a few feet from his head.

I think that Jackie Chan should be higher, none of the other almost death incidents required sugrery and he did almost die

I would rather have gotten a sword to my neck and kill me then get eaten alive by pirahnas. Just sayin

1- bob Hoskins

Worst top 10 of you channel.

Well,Paul Walker died on set... ;((((((((race in paridise, pauly.

10mill views??!!!!!????!!!!?!?!?!???!?

How exactly are you supposed to &quot;almost get hanged&quot; in a movie? Don&#39;t they take any kind of protection measures?! You don&#39;t need that much of a brain to realize that an accident might occur! Gosh :/

Y the fuck did they actually hang Michael j fox in back to the future

RESPECT BRENDAN FRASER. GOOD ACTOR! MOST UNDERRATED ACTOR :/

Woah. Time out. I can no longer trust this channels opinions, The rush hour sequels were the shit

what about Fitzacarraldo?

i dont get the breaking bad one a bolder rolled of the roof of the RV what was it doing up there in the first place?

it&#39;s all safe, this is just bullshit

Jackie Chan has enough near death experiences to fill 1-10...

love this video 11.57

stallone almost died twice.....what about those ?.....The first one was in first blood when he fell out of the tree...it could have killed him....but he broke his arm in that.The second time was in rocky 4.....when dolph lundgren hit him in the chest and it supposedly stopped his heart. These were not mentioned.

<a href="">5:56</a> xD

NO NOT MICHEAL J FOX!!! well at least he didn&#39;t die

Awe man I&#39;d wish this video wasn&#39;t out already cause I wanted to deconstruct this cause I wanted Harrison Ford in this list cause he broked his leg while shooting Star Wars Force awakening

Wait.......   Aaron Paul was almost killed by a random falling boulder....

It must really suck having to work with James Cameron

What about Bob Hoskins in Super Mario Bros

<a href="">6:38</a> BRUH!! OLD SPICE POWER GUY!! i thought she was joking lol...

Honorable mention: Dimebag Darrel.

I just heard today that Harrison Ford broke his leg and ankle while filming the new Star Wars and JJ Abrams broke his back trying to help him LOL

apparently shia lebeouf almost dies while making the first transformers in the scene where he is running from the junkyard dogs. apparently they used actual police dogs and they ran right past the trainer who was wearing the bite suit and kept chasing shai himslef. source: i was bored enough to watch the directors commentary for it and micheal bay started talking about it when he ran out of things to say.

the word &#39;bloke&#39; never sounds right coming from an American voice.

Okay, come on, seriously? Jim Caviezel, Passion of the Christ: He was having a freaking heart attack during the crucifixion! His skin was blue-hued, and that wasn&#39;t makeup. Not only that, he dislocated his shoulder several times in the same scene. Still, he kept going, even after the doctor told him he would likely die if he kept going. That&#39;s dedication! Come on, people!

If there isn&#39;t one already, you should have one of actors who did die on set.

now you see me

I doubt Tom was in any real danger since I doubt any of the swords on the set were sharpened.

You forgot Buster Keaton. He was literally suicidal and did so many of his infamous stunts because he did not care if he died.

The one on premium rush

I can think of a few hollywierd types that should do more of their own stuntwork

WHAT THE HELL? Jackie Chan slid down a pole with lights and got electrocuted, also fell of the top of a MOVING train, got into a car crash and got put on fire causing burns to his skin in &quot;thunderbolt&#39; and much more! Jackie Chan deserves way more credit. This list, is complete shit! Next time, Do your research

The order is screwed up. An infection at #2 and a skull fracture at @10 ?

this is fine

#1 for almost getting cut and #10 for falling a few meters high and cracking your skull. Great logic Mojo

we are happy for MMM to get to Uganda.

now you see me

Why was there a boulder on top of an RV?

Jackie still suffers from the effect of that one instance and he is not number one. wonderful

Look here to find what you love<a href="">

<a href="">5:57</a> the horse is like &quot;don&#39;t said me is a stupid&quot; cute!

Militare✋

Tom Harks the best!!

Fuck off about Rush Hour

the name is misleading

Eli Wallach on the set of &#39;The Good The Bad and The Ugly&#39; had some seriously close shaves. When lying on the rail track to use the trains wheels to cut his handcuffs he didn&#39;t see the step on the train carriage as nobody seemed to notice it. It nearly decapitated him as the train passed. He also drank a bottle of acid that he thought was water - Sergio Leone&#39;s fault. And in the hanging scene where the horse he&#39;s on runs off, apparently they used a young horse that was nervous. The horse ended up getting a big freight and running off at a speed of 40mph with Eil on his back with his hands tied around his back. The horse ran for about 2 miles before stopping.

Getting your Bone lodged in your brain &gt; missing a sword by an inch!!

If Tom Hanks died, we wouldn&#39;t have Toy Story 3!

The lone ranger wasnt even that bad XD

It&#39;s hanged lol

How is Jackie Chan N:10 when he had the most injury, the stunt was real and it was definitely N1. Tom Cruise could have been cut ... Cmon people. I say Tom Hanks and Cruise should go after N5.

This was awesome

also Johnny Depp &#39;s saddle slipped OMG obviously they don&#39;t even know how to tack up a horse ffs and I count that horse as being very smart because it thought to jump over him instead of try to swerve away

Back to the future - the guys got skills I&#39;ll give him that - hardly anyone can jump onto the back of a horse like that Bareback Nevermind the saddle and usuallyb if they tried the horse would kick out

<a href="">5:17</a> You mean &quot;hanged&quot;Hung is something entirely different

Jackie Chan all day nr 1. not these pussies what a fucked up ranking

Are you kidding...the Wizard of Oz doesn&#39;t even get an honorable mention. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the intro of a webpage that deals with the topic; &quot;The Wizard of Oz was one of the wildest and most infamous productions of any movie ever filmed. Did you know that half of the cast was either injured or nearly died during production, and one potential cast member did — before she was signed onto the film&quot;. Buddy Epsen&#39;s (original tin man) lungs were ruined for life by silver dust and he had to be removed from filming and the wicked witch suffered very severe burns...just to name a couple.

Lord of the rings: dagger throw

Hung and Hanged are not the same thing... and Michael J. Fox does not look particularly &quot;big&quot;

Peta got kicked by katness and he was knocked out!

Jackie Chan is the only &quot;Actors Who Almost Died on Set&quot;

wow that was wow

The reason Tom Cruise is so good at avoiding injuries/death is because of his high thetan levels

im surprised they didn&#39;t include apocalypse now

I don&#39;t think you should have added the actors/actresses that perform their own stunts. Like the stunt professionals you acknowledged should not be included, they too know what they are signing up for when they agree to do their own stunts.

I know this is easy to say in hindsight but what Isla should of done is flip off the crew while trying to explain she&#39;s stuck. They would of known that wasn&#39;t in the script and they would be able to assist her

missed Gerald Butler in chasing mavericks

Their compensation covers the risk.

Dude Most Jackie chan&#39;s movie he does the film legit

almost a year later...

no that was dumb jackie chan should ahve been number 1 and tom cruise shouldnt be on there, the swords were dull

hey

What about Jerome Howard (A.k.a) Curly

jackie chan must be in the top

its very confusing, but i think only johnny  Depp surfed injury on set.

fuck yea bttf 3 and lone ranger two of my favorite movies

no i don&#39;t

Sylvester stallone on the cast of the expandables 1

I would have said Bob Hoskins from the Super Mario Bros. movie. He got stabbed four times, broke a finger, got electricuted and NEARLY DROWNED!!!!How did that NOT make it onto the list?

The Titanic is a true story

What about Sean Kanan in The Karate Kid III? I read somewhere that he was almost killed in the fight scene that takes place at the Cobra Kai dojo. Specifically the scene where Miyagi throws him back into the dojo (after Terry Silver says &quot;See the trail? I think he peed in his pants&quot;).  <a href="#trivia">#trivia</a>

and here i&#39;m sitting in Denmark and there was killed a person during filming they did not know it was a sharp loaded gun.

what near death experiences caught my attention,,,,let me think,,, aaaaa 50 caliber bullets tearing down everything trees rocks but me,,,,,

What about mark wahlburg almost getting blown up on Lone Survivor set

Jackie Chan in Every Movie he&#39;s ever been in

<a href="">

Arnold in True Lies, when that horse almost didn&#39;t stop on the roof!

Alice in the wonderland 2 is coming out next year!

Jackie chan always nearly dies on set

LAMMMMMMME

In LOTR the actor playing sam severely cut his foot during a take

Jacki Chan should be  #1 in this list .. So DUMB. dislike .

These fucking people are worthless! The hoverboard and the car in back to the future never ruined the series. Seriously get a real job skank

#1 should have been Jim Caveizal filming The Passion of the Christ.  He was struck by lightening twice, contracted pneumonia and dislocated his shoulder during the filming..

What about the guy who played c3po? Part of his costume came off and cut in pretty bad in the leg

&quot;Do you agree with our list?&quot;  Im not exactly well studied in the field of celebrities almost dying on set.

Jackie Chan was supposed to be on top of your list bud..

JACKIE CHAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN #1! What a bad arrangement you did, watchmojo.

In the two towers the actor who plays Theodon is accidentally stabbed by a spear weilded by an Uruk-hai

soo nob he&#39;s all not dead he&#39;s still alivive

I wish Tom cruise actually died tho

Didn&#39;t one kid actor  in a Friday the 13th movie have a heart attack?Or am I thinking of something else?

I soooooooooooooo agrreee

I was expecting mission impossiblein this video.

Jason you are a Tough Transporter

I thought all this mother fuckers where real bad Asses and people actually died that what makes them so rich?

Google Louisa  Oasi and also check her out on youtube

Can someone tell me why there even was a boulder on the roof of the RV when Aaron almost died? Wtf.

jim caviezel the passion  - he got struck by lightning

The video is <a href="">11:11</a> min long hmmmm

Enough about Jackie Chan, I think they put him at tenth place because he is The Jackie chan and that he can take way more than others and this isn&#39;t who nearly dies the most. Meh think what you wank

Jackie should have been first, just because the numerous times he nearly died... That man is insane!! In a good way ;)

Jackie Chan Should Be Number 1!

RUSH HOUR WAS GREAT!!!

Good vid

How is Jackie chan in 10th place?

A fucking cracked skull is 10 positions lower than prop swords?I feel like a white girl right now, I just can&#39;t even...

I guess Brandon Lee belongs in a different category?

A boulder fell off the roof of the RV?  A BOULDER????

Sylvester Stallone Rocky IV. Punched in the chest so hard that it moved his heart.

avoided death? One Karate movie master bruce lee died while practicing a gun scene there was a real bullet inside the gun the maker of the movie accidentally shot Bruce lee Dead.....

Winona Ryder in aliens resurrection . The under water kitchen scene she actually drowned for 4 minutes

willson!!!!!!!

Well, when they got SPOILER ALERT Peeta back he almost choked her on accident.

LONE RANGER and the RUSH HOUR trilogy were BOX OFFICE HITS lmao this channel is crazy untrue your making a channel on opinions ignorant idiots. They take shots about good Movies and actors all the time claiming this so called bad movies are damaging great actors careers lol like they&#39;re experts with opinions lol those movies did great at the box office and rush hour movies had sequels which means they did well duh watch mojo Lone Ranger was amazing I love that movie. just Unsubscribe I am they&#39;re crazy NO body&#39;s WONDERING about your channel NO body CARES @watchmojo you have the worst list and you guys bash good movies and actors that have more talent than your stupid Literally ignorant channel that&#39;s has no idea what it&#39;s talking about and look at the comments everyone agrees the only reason you have views is people wanna know what kinda bullshit list you out together and what great actors career your gonna diss again. Seriously eat some dicks and get a life I hope you read this and it sinks in and you end this dreadful channel or at least make it better and stop talking shit about great movies and artist how the hell does using you basic biased opinion appeal to all audiences like that&#39;s like me saying pirates of the Caribbean killed Depps acting career and I&#39;m saying that just cause I don&#39;t like it... Do you realize how stupid that would make me.. Knowing how great the movies did . Now you&#39;re doing that with so many great movies box office hits and movies that have had 3 or 4 sequels NEWS FLASH WATCH mumbojumbo movies don&#39;t have that&#39;s many sequels and end actors careers or stink. So get your facts straight and maybe I&#39;ll take you seriously! Stop spreading your opinions and show some facts. Gosh.

james cameron drowns in money, obviously

i have a big pines

seriously sword porn

Stallone was close to death in Rocky lV, when Dolph Lungren hit him so hard in the chest, his heart hit his ribcage and became swollen. He was intensive care for five days.

No Oliver Reed? For shame!

Something is very wrong with that horse!

CROOZ SHOOD HAV DYD

Ivete

Putting Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks in the &quot;honorable mentions&quot; was a joke. Tom Hanks was in a hospital the entire and and DIDN&#39;T get &quot;blood poisoning&quot;. It would be different if he had stayed on set and maybe got &quot;blood poisoning&quot;. And Tom Cruise &quot;Almost&quot; having an accident is like when you say &quot;I was so hungry I almost died&quot;. Now if his co-star had actually struck him, maybe. But they perform those fights under very strict guideline to make it look as real as possible but NEVER really put the actors in danger. The only time they are ever &quot;actually&quot; in danger is when something goes wrong. Cruise and his co-star were on mechanical horses. They knew how close they could get without touching. Now Jason flying off a cliff. THAT is almost loosing your life. Heck, even putting the &quot;bolder&quot; guy in was reaching. How was there a &quot;bolder&quot; on the RV. I&#39;m guessing it was a rock to hold a tarp or something and he jokingly said &quot;bolder&quot;.

Why&#39;s it always have to be a &quot;top&quot; ten?

yes

<a href="">9:22</a> its hung hanged is not a word

wtf is wrong with Rush Hour!!!!!!

did she say flying skate boards ruined the realism in b2d?  they have em now

haha seriously cutting his hand nearly killed him and jackie chan gets n 10 for smashing his skull. i mean people cut their hands on daily basis but  not everyone smash his head and live to see another day. but hey this is watchBULLSH...

i&#39;m going to stopwatching ur videos, u thing jackie 10th place????????????????????????

I watched &quot;The Call&quot; it&#39;s really tough to watch without your heart racing.

Hmm, Jackie Chan at number 10 and Tom Cruise at number 1? This isn&#39;t Top 10 Actors who nearly died on set or Top 10 Times an Actor nearly Died on Set, or Top 10 Scenes in which an Actor almost died filming...

How about top 10 actors who died on set.

Jackie Chan is number 1 no matter what anyone says

saying the last samurai was &quot;sword porn&quot; you a dumb ass it shows the true art of ancient Japanese culter, how dare you discrase it with such a remark

damn Jackie chan. He&#39;s  old now. Probably hurting more than ever cuz of those broken bones

Even Sylvester Stallone is a fantastically well rounded actor {LOL} compared to Jason Statham . Jason  can only grimace and grunt in every film.

WHY ISN&#39;T THE GUY WHO PLAYED GILLIGAN FROM GILLIGANS ISLAND ON HERE! ON THE EPISODE WHERE THE LION WASHED ONTO THE ISLAND HE NEARLY DIED! CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THIS!

10th Million person to watch this :D :) :P

i think Jackie Chan should be the first.

Jamie Alexander didnt nearly die, at best an honourable mention. The same for Aaron Paul, changing location before the incident meant he didnt get a scratch.

Jack Chan should be number 1 just saying

I don&#39;t like the shot at the Rush Hour sequels, those are hilarious!! And lone Ranger didn&#39;t damage Depp&#39;s career too bad, Black Mass was phenomenal and a hit.

lol 10M+ views.

Cruise did not get hurt, why is he no.1?  Is this channel funded by Scientology? Still love this channel though....

Jim Caviezel/ Passion of the Christ... pneumonia,  hypothermia, dislocated shoulder and struck by lightning.Tiz True

Leave it to Jennifer Lawrence to choke on fog machine fog. That would have been one of the most embarrassing ways to die.

Jackie Chan &#39; s Injury Looked Brutal!

Sherry Bailey    Personally I can&#39;t stand Tom Cruise every time I see that big self serving grin I just want to slap it.

wow, I thought being an actor was to easy

What? i love Rush Hour AND the lone ranger!Do i have bad taste?..

I&#39;m unsubscribing your channel if you don&#39;t make video of Jackie Chan top number of stunts where he got hurt bad!Seriously? Number 10 for him? I have started to doubt the quality of all other videos from your channel now. Rectify your mistake by making a tribute video of Jackie Chan.

i knew jackie chan would be in this.but din&#39;t expect that he would be #10

Jackie Chan is a shitty actor. Don&#39;t matter if he performs his own stunts.

they have run out of ideas

I won&#39;t watch now you see it the same again.

Now I clicked again accidently on this mojo video, I blocked this channel and they keep showing me their videos, wtf? they are everywhere

nbvgfdee vv xxxxx.

the Rush Hour sequels were amazing! fuck off

I almost dieded watching these movies

ehh Eli Wallach in The Good The Bad and The Ugly? he had multiple near death experiences during the filming 

<a href="">0:47</a> Fake

<a href="">0:55</a> good thing chan survived or who else would pose as the mlg boss?

Next video: Top Ten Actors who actually DID Die on Set

Amitabh Bachchan should have been on the list

Jurgen Prochow, was permanently scarred during the making of DUNE

you should do funniest black ops 2 kills pls I will sub

Isla Fischer&#39;s seemed a bit more severe than the others.

Really, Jackie shoulda been #1 on this list. Whoever thought he should be 10 should be fired

If Jonny Depp would have died while filming it would have been a instant classic and he would have got a post death oscar.

Bob Hoskins was stabbed 3 times, electrocuted, and nearly drowned while filming Super Mario Brothers.

Yes, I cried when Tom Hanks&#39; character lost Winston.  I admit it.

When a person is executed, it&#39;s &quot;hanged&quot; not &quot;hung.&quot;  It sounds bad but it&#39;s true.  Look it up.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬T H I S  C O M M E N T  I S  C O P I E D  A N D  P A S T E D▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

what are you talking about ?! lone ranger was great !!

HOLY SHIT!!!

*hanged

sword porn lol

Jackie Chan should&#39;ve been #1

Brandon Lee...oh no wait &quot;almost&quot; died. Thats what this was. :/

I&#39;ve nearly drown 39 times.

Brandon Frazier almost died on the mummy the hanging scene.

Amitabh Bachhn in COOLI

walking tall the rock Johnson when he&#39;s getting his ass kicked by the small dudes acaully broke his ribs and stuff

I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t wear heels... or skirts... or make up... or tube tops... or finger nail polish... or hair dye... or- dear God, why do women do all this? To each their own I suppose, but damn, literally risking one&#39;s neck and ankles for the sake of lifting the heels of your feet thereby causing the arching of your back while also adding some height... seems unnecessary, not to mention uncomfortable. If I were a woman, I&#39;d definitely pop over to the other side of the fence, as it were. Pants, and comfortable shoes. That&#39;s the way to go B) Oddly enough, I did enjoy that one time I had a pony tail however.

I don&#39;t not agree with the lineup of this list; and for sure Martin Sheen should have been on the lower end of this list.  His heart attack was a direct cause of filming that movie. Tom Cruise ? coulda woulda shoulda.  Jackie Chan was a pretty bad injury.  Tom Hanks getting sepsis is serious.  The rest, please!

say honestly....................................................................................

this is the worst count

JAKIE CHAN should be the FIRST. JAKIE is the BEST.    NO ONE COME CLOSE TO HIM.

&quot;James Cameron does not do what James Cameron does for James Cameron... James Cameron does what James Cameron does because he is, James Cameron.&quot;
