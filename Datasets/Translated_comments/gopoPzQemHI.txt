I hate pigeons too.

<a href="">4:17</a> which movie is this? 

You need to know that Censor board does not watch any movies. They get 50 people from diverse backgrounds to watch the movie and fill out a form if they had any objections.

Censor board approval ki bat kisi ail film mein bhi nahi dikhi why u have made this video stupid

The movie Yaarana movie sequence was copied by Chiranjeevi in the movie &#39;Daddy&#39;

Ooha scene is so disturbing If I were in her place, saale ko kheechke table se maarti 

bro stop using the word literally so much.

These matlab kuch bhi videos are one of a kind,good time to laugh with some hilarious moments to savour!

&quot;Abla hu Tabla nahi &quot;was actually good bro

The scene of Vikram was shocking to say the least

Hey Jammy what do you think about do Barra (the remake of Mirage) and is it going to open up paths for other filmmakers to make this kind of intellectual movies or gonna start a new trend of remaking outside India  masterpiece

you deserve kudos for not being biased against any one part of movie industry and analysing movies from bollywood, tamil, telugu and other regional cinemas. Im glad u picked up some south indian movies for this section, mostly youtubers just blindfoldly praise south indian movies to shame bollywood.

It&#39;s like &#39;rape&#39; is a household name in movies. They celebrate it followed by marriage.

The Houseful 4 scene reminded me that the something similar happened in Main Khiladi Tu Anari; Saif Ali Khan&#39;s character gets Akshay Kumar&#39;s character drunk and tells him that someone is harassing Shilpa Shetty&#39;s character, so Akshay in his drunken state proceeds to Shilpa&#39;s room to protect her but passes out, only to wake up with no clothes on and Shilpa&#39;s outfit torn crying rape. Then as Saif is pretending to reprimand Akshay there&#39;s a phone call between Akshay and Shilpa in which she tells him that I LOVE YOU KARAN I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU....Churake Dil Mera

Bollywood always normalise rape culture. Boycott Bollywood movies if they don&#39;t respect women

Looks like evolution takes a back step on each consecutive Housefull movie

Censor board are dogs! Haddi feko bas

B in Bollywood is bullshit

The pigeon scene is no mistake

I feel pity for some of 90s people who were fan of this kind of shit.

Don&#39;t waste your time on arguing on bollywood. Bollywood was, is and will be cringe for atleast 1 millennium

Everyone in the comments is just criticizing bolywood ignoring the fact that Ooga scene was more disgusting

this guy improved my vocabulary to the next level.



Don’t even have enough sense to use a pop filter but sure chastise the editor for trying to salvage a film plagued by troubled production.

You really got nice voice bro.

There is no censor board in India - technically. It&#39;s a board for film certification and that&#39;s it. You cannot have a genuine censor board in a democracy that supposedly has right to freedom of speech and expression.

Bruhh Indian movie mein pigeon nahi bacha saktaLekin vincenzo web series mein to sab chalta ha india ki nahi ha na isliye usko to appreciate hi karenge.

How long did it take you to write the Introduction line??

JanEMan Malayalam Movie Review kaar loo!!It&#39;s dam worth the time!!!!

Only Bollywood grandmothers would make such horrendous statements. ‍️

That Vikram scene was super unsettling and odious. Wtf. Tyrant and inhumane “hero”.

Bro you are too woke.

vai mera sar dard kar raha he

Savage

To be fair to madhuri, clark kent gets away being superman with the help of a spectacle. Marvel and DC give me a headache even today. 

South ki makkhi ki script issi pigeon ko dekh ke likhi gayi yeh imagine what if instead of nagin a pigeon wants to take revenge fast forward 2015 age of VFX hence makkhi came in play.

oh my god

Trolling movie is fine but bro “why you are reading script”

What’s funny is that I always thought  these South Indian films are dubbed in Hindi with these horrendous  translations…never did I imagine that the dialogues are actually that sleezy even in the original version! Thanks for opening my eyes Jammy!!! 

plz make review northeast movies

Wth....no wonder a man beating his wife with a belt doesn&#39;t shock...Like what is wrong with people?This was evidence on camera...Did the character redeem himself or was he STILL the hero?

What is it with Kriti Kharbanda and rape jokes?

Housefull 4 is probably the cringiest movie I hv ever watched.

That pigeon is an animagus form of Neville Longbottom from the Harry Potter series.

birds do take revenge though, especially crows

Why can&#39;t a pegion take revange.. Haven&#39;t you seen the movie makhi where a makhi takes a revange.. 90&#39;s inspiration reloaded. A makhi taking revange a makhi..

Brother ,I am your fan.yeh log khak manoranjan karte hain,bas  dimaag kharab karte hain.aise faltu logon ki kya jaroorat hain.kash  yeh cinema hi nahi hota .kaise bekar log hain yeh .inhe iocon ya idol samjhana bewqufi hain.they are nothing.lekin aap lage rahiye mujhe aapka presentation bahut pasand hain.,

That’s why I don’t like watching Indian movies(except for very few which have good meaning).

There&#39;s a pigeon rescuing scene in kdrama Vincenzo also. If you get time plz see ir



KABOOTAR KA BADLA HAHAHAHA

Sensor board is sleeping.

Interesting.. I noticed the background sounds given by jammy jst now.. I have seen many videos and failed to notice that there was a background sound..

Kabootar Ja ja ja 

I noticed the way you say kuch bhi . You sound like kuuuuch bhi but you are supposed to say it at once like kuch bhi 

He will always have some content....thanks to bollywood

Aakhir kabootar bhi toh insaan hota hai !!

damn- i never realized the googly scene was so stupid, it&#39;s a really good movie, i am a bit disappointed but what can you expect from a common village granny &quot;trope&quot; in a movie

Inzaghi to the rescue, if u know, u know

Very well explored! Thank you so much for all your hard work. These scenes are seriously disturbing and should be exposed as much as possible. Much appreciation from the UK!

Oo bhai jada English met jaro apna basa bolne ke lye srm krta hai kiya be

Housefull 4 should have been named &quot;the revenge of Kabootar&quot;.

Oooosm

It&#39;s most probably just me but the pigeon saving the day reminded me of vincenzo&#39;s injagi. Anyone?? I really enjoyed the drama.

Our censor board is so libral matlab unki ma shod ke aaoge toh wo Harz bhi na karenge but Uski ma razi honi chahiye

Googly was my favourite film back then

Bhai mene to movie dekha he chod diya

Ayyo algrow

The kabootar part was kinda cool ngl

And guess what??Xmen Apocalypse movieCensor board remove Apocalypse stating himself as Krishna

The last one was really kuchh bhii!!!!

They can show anything as audience I mean mass can absorb anything or everything if lead actors are superstars

India censored hanuman ki jai in black panther movie

Guys pls stop I can’t like all the comments they are hilarious 

You should have done the Tug lIfe Meme for the Gangster Pigeon, would have so funny!

Hindi bolne sharam athi hai

I miss the quality content this channel used produce... This is just clickbait

Stop narrating.. You&#39;re ruining the scenes

In 2019 I was 14 years old and liked this movie and now I am 16 and I am ashamed of myself for ever liking it . I mean i don&#39;t know have I matured in 2 years or I was out of my senses in 2019 . This movie is a real piece of shit .

Plz yogi ji convert bollywood name into chutiyawood

There’s a movie starring Rani mukarjee with an absurd plot defying morality and ethics. This movie filled with sexist , bigotry dialogues and belief systems had portrayed that a woman ought to marry her rapist. Even worse, she tries to convey her worthiness to her rapist by suggesting marriage and is utterly vile and undignified. I can’t remember the movie name. It was in 90s I think 

<a href="">3:58</a> Madhuri exactly looks like Katy Perry

Housefull 4 = 200 croBhavesh Joshi = 1.2 croIt&#39;s indian audience 

I absolutely admire this channel. He is not only talking the right things, but mixing it with humor makes sure it reaches a bigger scale of audience. I cannot believe of the regressive, sexist, racist, toxic scenes and dialogues movies have even today. Not just in Bollywood, even Hollywood which is considered super progressive. Making jokes on rape? Marrying the girl to the rapist? because of course once a guy takes a girl’s virginity he owns her right. It’s like virginity is like a thing or a contract to be “taken” by someone. Mind you the same logic doesn’t apply to guy’s virginity because woh toh Mard hain. Well I digress!

I’ve listen this voice in social channel 

Maine pyaar kiya is one of the best movie ever.....what are you talking about....if you don&#39;t know or have a talent in making contents dont bro cos ur embarassing yourself ‍️

Houseful 4 is used to convert black money to white by bjp

Padhte time itna dimaag laga letaa..

NCB should immediately search writers of these films,I am sure they will get some stuff there.

Housefull 4 was funny

There is yet another blunder about the pigeon in Maine Pyar Kia. Passenger/homing/carrier/postman pigeons fly only in one direction i.e their home. That&#39;s why you have to personally take them to a certain location and send message with them to the place where you have raised them. It&#39;s not like a SMS that it will go, find a person, deliver the message and will return with the reply.

In Vikram movie Ooha he is doing a negative role. He purposefully does it because he doesn&#39;t want her as wife. The movie doesn&#39;t support the abuse. There are some scenes in the movie like this used to show how evil he is. He is not really shown heroically in the movie. He is really negative in the movie and he also gets killed at the end by one of the actresses. The movie doesn&#39;t support his abuse. It is just a little too dramatic and yea the girl doesn&#39;t do anything about it, but doesn&#39;t support abuse in any way.

Our censored board be likeJohn wick Mai ka cgi khoon Kat do aur tobacco ke ad Mai asle jabda dikhana

You are right bro Bollywood movie is copy,inlogical,and bad

हिंदी भाषा बोलते वक़्त मुँह दुखता है क्या भाई या शर्म आती है?

What is the movie ooha about

Your voice is everything ..

Googly is a very good movie... It is beyond that old woman scene , the movie&#39;s story  is so good that we hardly noticed it.

Hindi or subtitles please

The last scene from googly in whole context of movie doesn&#39;t feels offensive as seen here separately.

I thought that scene of googly was funny

Housefull 4 =matlab kuch bhi^(kuch bhi)Probably the only movie which I quit midway..

By the scene from telugu you showed i dont think what you said was right better comment on the language you know dont try to fool waise bhi andh bhakt bahut hai hamare india main jise pujtte hai woh jo bhi kahe maan lete hain

You sound too fuckin robotic . Thoda insaano ke tareeke se voiceover karo yaar

The Bollywood films have become soo much cringey. Doesn&#39;t feel like seeing anything except south Indian. 

90&#39;s!!!20&#39;s ki movies konsi achi hai

Your accent hurt my ears.



ek hi mouth hai, kitni baar creep bolvaoge?

They censored Lord Hanuman&#39;s name from Black Panther movie when they were taking his name with respect.

Really disgusting dialogues ,

Kabootar ne badla le liya 

Bro a snake could really make revenge, why not a pigeon.

It should not be censored. That&#39;s the point. Wtf?

Dialogue kha hain

<b>Chutiya bana rahe hai baar baar bane banayen chutiyon ko</b> 

Pls speak in hindi hume English smj nhi aati

<a href="">6:32</a>  the idea must have come from Akshay... His Main anari tu khiladi movie has this sequence of shilpa getting him drunk and later accusing him of lootoing her .. And then the anari saif comes to tell cop akshay to marry her, aur bas pyaar hojata hai

out of context I love you 

Googly was flim that I saw when I was literally 9 or 10 I swear I remember how disturbed I was with that dialogue like that like excuse me what the hell I was small and I was so werided out and dialogue writer I don&#39;t how he thought that was okay it was annoying they mentioned raping like it was something very casual that shows the amount of concern india has on this like taht one dialogue can influence people into thinking assault is Okay I&#39;m really thankful u brought it up that scence is so messed up in my opinion

And they banned anime.



Ur sigh reminds me of someone

Just one thing bollywood is bullshit .

I just wanted to say...Your voice is really addicting

hahhahaha

Movie give very wrong message to audience subconsciously hero are generally cheaters stalker playboy but in real things different

I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong if a director is trying to make people believe that animals/birds have emotions too .....har jagha sirf logic chaiye ...i really appreciate suraj bharatiya for creating a human like space for animals and birds in no animal centric movies.

hey there is korean drama airing these days called Vicenzo had the almost same pigeon scene in its ep 15. Although in whole that drama is amazing but the sequence where &quot;injaghi&quot; the pigeons name comes the save the hero with his gangs of hundreds of pigeon when the hero was about to get shot was something hilarious and took me back to this scene of &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot;......

A master piece like mardanni is still dealing with censor board issue..where housefull 4 is jus okey

It&#39;s called sense of humour



grandma of 2013 = Supreme court 2021Ironic

Ur English is very well 

bro as a indian youtuber. can you please use more hindi than english in your videos

Dude that kannada movie dialogue at the end it is not meant to looked at, the way you are looking at... It is a comedy scene making fun of other movie scenes &amp; real instances which show marriage of rape victims, in a sarcastic manner.

The the he says ‘mtlb kuch bhi&#39; gets into my ️

I have a question: Don&#39;t you ever get copyright issues?

Do review Odia movies. It will give you content for a lifetime.Having said that, there are also great Odia movies that can pave a path to ur list of movies that are celebrated.

people are only blaming bollywood but i think south indian movies are worse. they will show women as inferior and who are dependent on heroes and who have nothing else to do rather than seduce the hero or just ask him for help. also they will judge the women wear in a very disgushting way. i think the south indian movies are mainly made by egoistic men also they will justify domestic violence and rape. moreover the film kabir singh is made from arjun reddy whose actor was vijay deverakonda whose films are always very bad for women.

Self promotion in between 

the pegion thing is a true fact thou

I really hate so much Bollywood

Don&#39;t have time to do so much research in films

Abe chuthiye

Censor Board banned Shinchan(also censored it) and also banned anime in India but WTF! These Bollywood scenes and creepy dialogues are still aired ‍

Wtf end wale clip ke subtitles hi hide kr diye pta hi ni chala kuch

People should know the difference between sex, rape and marriage.

Omg the first movie with Body double...LOL...on the other side how can people make joke on rape.. how do these actors allow themselves to speak or act these stuff....are these people normal ??!!!

Kindly talk in hindi

Movies are for entertainment, it has not relevance at all with real life.... Waste of time.... Why to explore

Bollywood heroes fight and win over a gang, Hollywood heroes fight and win over an entire nation and sometimes an entire planet...

<a href="">03:24</a>

They literally silent &quot;GLORY TO HANUMAN&quot; from black panther

Is there anyone here who like his voice?

I think directors and writers were closet rapists

House full 4 depict what crap Bollywood stand for

How dare u... that pigeon inspired JK Rowling&#39;s manifestation of phoenix 

I subscribed now. I will add some points about other movies. &quot;Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswati&quot;, when Ganga (Amitabh) is warming Jamuna (Meenakshi) who was freezing, he cant do it without having intercourse (we see the spiderweb breaking, used as a symbol). In a later movie, i think Saugandh, the director might have picked up that &quot;innocent trick&quot; of the previous movie script and subtly debunked it: Akshay Kumar is not having intercourse with Shantipriya while she is freezing to death, he is warming her like a decent boy would do. Okkk, in the morning, although she feels perfectly alright and with no physical pain at all, she is still sure that he raped her and she is trying to kill him. Maybe the directors should consider what women abused in their real life would have to say about it. (Sorry, i sent my msg by mistake before finishing it, i had to Edit).

Rape pe joke nahi hai, jhuta rape pe joke hai. Ladka ko shaadi ke liye taiyaar karne ke liye, ladki pregnant hone ka daawa karti hai, ladka taiyaar ho jaata hai.Raja, Masterji, jaisi kai film hai, jahan ladki apne pyar ko paane ke liye galat aarop laga deti hai.

Who knew that last kuch bhi would be  a reality... marry the man who r*pe you

Save  your time once again misleading TITLE 

David dhawan will get featured in every such videos

Thanks for watching Kannada movie

People were scared of pigeons back in the days

Please  speak in hindi

This is how it was portrayed in real life back in those days. If guy rapes a girl, the whole village used to get together, even the girl&#39;s parent agrees for that marriage and life goes on... Here, the two incidents which you have pointed out, Housefull4 is from a different century and the Grandmother has a decades old mindset.. Directors or dialogues writers are just trying to depict that... not 21st century ideology... PS: Ideal situation is to punish the rapist with the highest possible level and not get the victim married to him....Ironically, Even today (21st century) this justice does not happen in all genuine rape cases reported

David Dhawan chutiya hai

Ye naruto ban kar skte hai par ye sab nahu mtlb much bhi

Worst country.

Why isn&#39;t bollywood dealing in science fiction drama thrillers, or a physiological crime , jenres that are riding in the west.

All fucking movies....with fuc*<b>*</b> sensors...

Actually in Maine Pyaar ki ya, the pigeon in the flashback is different than the pigeon who killed Mohnish Behl

WHAT A FUNNY MOMENTUM THAT IS IN HOUSEFULL 4PREGNANT JUST AFTER A RAPE....THEN FALL IN LOVEhaahahaha

bhai it was joke in last scene

No disrespect but though Akshay Kumar is one the best persons but Houseful 4 is the worst Comedy Movie ever!!!!!

Bakchod angraj

Basically the Indian sensors are on drugs

Kabootar ka swag

The flashbacks of the bird sent me into a fit of laughter.

English is superband Good post exposing the idiots

I like the housefull series cause I love a good laugh. However, I remember cringing so hard when that rape joke played out. And yes, this fourth installment was not that funny.

Don&#39;t grape us with such type of shifty vidoes

I&#39;m in love with your voice actually..... &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot; sounded cool

Housefull 4 was disaster.

Pigeon

How on earth housefull is doing business 

I wonder how much shit you have to watch

you come up with nice content 

gyan bollywood pe pr totally english mai. chutiya sala

I appreciate the murderous pigeon. 

When I was watching Housefull 4 at my house, I was slept after Half hour of movie. Too much Overacting.

Bro it was the grandmother in googly.  She spoke like one. Very realistic. Thats how their generation was. You dont expect a granny to speak about feminism and all.

That Googly dailouge is bad!! And yeah a lot of it is bad and bullshit but Yash and Kriti&#39;s pairing was really good!!!!!!!!!  That&#39;s why it became a blockbuster

And they tell anime is second name of lust and violence so it is banned in india .?Wtf censor board

Chutiya bollywood wale 

When i looked at the title i thought &quot;every single bollywood song and ad promoting racism and objectifying&quot;

Where do you people live and what you are made from stand in front of me I will show you how ugly you are from inside. Just for blaming you made this you think you are pretty smarter than those generations. Criticisms should be Healthy or thought provoking,movie is for fun so many illogical things will be there like !in Spider-Man. Scenario that depict those situations based on the society they lived. What made you think you are in brilliant generation, our generation will be one of the most impotent generation that earth would have seen. We produce useless and worthless people more than any generation

I hate this flim

I want my Rs200 back for my eye treatment after watching this movie

Kuch Bhi !!!!

This things happen in every film industri,Specialy in South industry.Even in bollywood so many nusence are there.

Matlabb kuchhhh bhiiiii osmmmm

To be honest if u watch ooha full movie that scene u would realise it was intentionally regressive

Ohhh ohhhhh Ganja Ganjaaaaa...........

Yeh toh Houseful 4 ke scenes hain.not so bad because there is love in story.worse scenes of Bollywood were approved.why so judgemental without thought.

<a href="">6:37</a> main abla hu tabla nahi

One thing is very interesting you explain in  English and speak in between a little bit of hindi may be your mother tongue and it&#39;s more interesting whatever hindi speaking people do must be a gold standard be it double standard as well.

Maine comment kiya (2020)

I remember watching the 1st Housefull film in theatre back in college. It was bang avg, had a lot of lame jokes - the writing was on the wall for me once I saw Akshay Kumar engaging in a slapping match with a monkey and then later getting electrocuted and dancing like Michael Jackson as a result.All these years later and I haven&#39;t watched another film from the Housefull/Dhamaal franchise and am much healthier for it.

O zandu hindi bol

Yash rocky bhai kgf

The telugu movie Sarileru Neekevvaru should also be included in this list

Bollywood...chutiyapa overloded...

U r the best

Please make sure your translators aren&#39;t fooling you... I&#39;m sorry to make such an accusation on your translators, but the dialouges too irrational and irresponsible.

Seriously kuch bhi!

These scenes were stupid indeed and embarrasses us as an audience. But you lost me when you give a title that scenes should not be approved and say that the Censor Board have right to cut scenes from a movie. Dude, filmmakers all along the country are arguing for Censor Board restricting it&#39;s power to just certifying films and not interfering with the scenes thereby allowing freedom of expression. Of course a stupid filmmaker should be allowed to express his stupidity. Let him learn the hard lesson through audience response. If you have both talented and mediocre creators in an industry, of course talented ones are going to win over and dominate eventually. Malayalam Film Industry is the live proof for that. Totally disagree with your opinion that these scenes should be cut, just because they seem stupid, silly and intolerable.

Your content &gt;&gt;&gt; wtf is on with Bollywood logic

Bhai houseful 1 is the best but houseful4 cringe comedy and vulgar dialogue

Kabir Singh ko mention nahi karega ?

bc houseful dekha ek scene me hasi nai aaye. or man keya akshay chu kumar ko bolu ke aam bech gadhe tu

Nice

<a href="">2:47</a>And Blackbuck in &quot;We are together&quot;.

Amazing Jami

What do you expect from the censor board when they censor shows like f*<b>king SHIN-CHAN but they air visually disturbing shows like Crime Patrol with little to no censorship whatsoever.*sigh</b>

But the pigeon is so damn cute!

Even sarileru neekevvaru, also has a rape joke

Gxyfuhoj

It&#39;s 2020 and almost the end of septmeber, n i haven&#39;t moved past march.

I&#39;m always heard your voice  but dude you are hot

His voice kind of sounds like Akshay Kumar s

Finally people are seeing it and talking about it whereas this channel has been talking about it since long ago️

I stopped watching housefull franchise after houseful 2

UmmmI think the housefull 4 wala scene was copied from &#39;Dangerous Khiladi 2&#39; (btw this is the name of the dubbed movie cuz I don&#39;t know what the original one is, it&#39;s a Telugu movie)

this guy talking in english or hindi xd

&quot;Kabutar ne badla le liya&quot; HAHAHAHA best

Dude in love with your content... Best part is Matlab kuch bhi

South Indian movie oha totally disturbing

Whatever we say but revolution is coming slowly someday tried and refused productions channels name will be (working and successful productions ) .

Cringe

And these people don&#39;t allow animes is India

I love you sir

Love how you say “matlab kuuuuch bhi”

This scene is not from Ooha movie

Googly was a good film ️

&quot;rape karega toh shadi kar lena&quot; humor ke liyey yey line add karna tha movie wallo ko.. BC ittney sarey actors producers kisi ney v nahi socha yey unkey samney ho raha hai.

What a useless movie Housefull four was. This can only be expected from Sajid.

I legit like your videos even before watching them 

you talk very much we want content not your speech

Housefull 4 was they were showing&quot; something&quot; else in the name of comedy

You should eat ismart Shankar. It’s got a scene where the hero chases the heroine to rape her and then she falls in love with him. I couldn’t watch the movie anymore after that

2020 is matlab kuch bhi episode for us

I was watching Bala and left the theatre in middle of the movie because kuch bhi kuch bhi. I wasted my money and time 

U r voice 

I love this channel! No fake rumors ans No fake thumbnails! You also come up with great thought through these reviews and analyses

Matlab kuuuuch bhi

<a href="">

This Whole movie was a CLEAVAGE show and Bro not agree with Googly...Its IMDB rating is stil 7.4...SO it matters.

Housefull4 mei jammy tha muje Laga Kriti ke sath

Sheedha seedha ye kaho indian public  paidaishi chutiyaa hoti hai..

That Vikram movie is a pure horror.

Dont mk vdo for the sake of money.maja nahi aya vai..matlab kuch bhi!!

Hindi movie ko English me define kyu karte h

houseful 4 is the evidence thats humans need to evolve

Worst was ooha, Googly and Houseful 4 these kind of movies should be banned

There is a recent film on Netflix I can’t remember the name but basically story is a pan dukhan is opened in front of a SCHOOLGIRLS house and all local MEN come to ogle at her. It’s absolutely DISGUSTING. The main story is paan shop owner falling in love with her. Ermm excuse me but isn’t that ILLEGAL??  How can they pass such storylines for movies? 

Yaraana was one movie which completely defied logic

Sir your talking stis just owsome I love it so much

How can somebody like movie housful 4 I used to see this movie on star gold  one day but I can&#39;t tolerate this unusual  bakwass movie .I quit this movie in 30 minutes. Vv bakwass movie.

Housefull 4 is the worst movie ever.

Bro Housefull 4 is a masala film, it was meant to be over the top. Reason people went to watch.It would be foolish to think they would win any critics. You need distinguish between serious films and masala films. I hope you don&#39;t review Hera pheri and Golmaal. SMH!

Bro...were r the dialogues?

You know the film Oohaa is just an example Telugu film Industry is the most  patriarchal because the society is so, The women must be subservient that&#39;s the norm she has to suffer all beatings,  harrassment and mental torture for the sake of the children and the society, Oohaa depicts the same

Kabutar ne badla le liya

Mai abla hu tabla nahi, this dialogue was so disgusting I hated myself for even watching it. How come these dialogues are approved

Too much English

Well most of these are meant to be senseless dark humour. I mean that Vikram scene even looks like it feeds into the overall narrative of the plot. This video is actually KuCh bHi

Many times it happens in my school that children just go crazy when films like judwaa-2, housefull-4,war, race-3 and total dhamaal are out in the theatres (and many more shit)..... And I am like there are so spectacular films out there and they just want to watch plain nonsense.... As audience we need to wake up and start to acknowledge all the movies which explain us what happens in our society and what needs to change instead of watching senseless movies. This is a request

<a href="">06:50</a> The most shocking thing is that Akshay Kapoor even agreed to take part in this shitfest. You look back at his &#39;Padman, Toilet, Rustom&#39; and you see this, makes me wonder if the celebrities forget about morals when it comes to &#39;Kaise Kitchen Chalaye Rakhe&#39;. Let&#39;s just say that I was severely severely disappointed with him as one of my favorites, after knowing him being a part of such movie, where something as serious as Rape, is shown as something of a gag joke. Bobby...Eh. Ritesh? He&#39;s part of Masti Franchise so what more can you expect. The Actresses, very obviously chosen because they are hot, but possess no acting talent. N even if they did, they waste it in &#39;Tatti&#39; like these. Welcome to the new N- Bollywood.

Kash ye hindi me bolta h

Censorship problems.

Such a CRAP

Are bhai ab to faltu movie dekhna band kro

Kuch bhee

His reaction at <a href="">6:53</a> mtlb kuch bhi !!!!

Misleading title

Great video bro

What is this regressive ,it was a rage in 90&#39;s might not fit your perception but the aim is same to earn money from movies we can&#39;t dump it on the movies and director, they showed what the the people of that want to see, will you take your parents to cleaners who were there at that time enjoying those movies it&#39;s easy to critises  and difficult to make content today which is appreciated by everyone think about it jammy. What will you call what people are making today like mastizade etc and all buddy you need to understand that before bringing down the movies of the past because of their content I must say what idiotic things you are watching.

Bollywood should stop shaming LGBT community and make movies like shubh mangalam jyada saavdhaan.

Why are you talking in English?  Earning money by trolling a HINDI Movie...And you are narrating in ENGLISH....Bhai Ek no ka Desi hai tu...Zyada cool hoke English m mat bola kar....Trolling a Hindi movie in English language is disrespecting to our movie Industry &amp; Our Nation..Itna English v achhi nehi bolta hai tu.......Like Comment, if you guys agree with me...

South movies tottaly brain wash

Meri biwi ka jawaan nhi good movie

Father: Hardwork pays offSon:I understoodBollywood:R u kidding meNepotism:

Bro your voice is like kartik aaryan

Like seriously

I just want to watch anime ( English dub or sub coz I can&#39;t imagine hindi dub spoiling it ) in national tv

Disgusting &amp; embracing how censor brd insensitive...no Eyes or Ears either..my god

u missed the whole movie of humshakals ...  not to forget himmatwala as well

Kuch bhi

Apki English bahut acchi hai.

Too much blah  blah blah

Seriously.. You are looking for logic in Bollywood movies??

Hindi me bolo na bhaiya

Abhey maine pyar kiya 80&#39;s ki film 89 me releaseResearch karoRespect peigion

Yeh kya tha?!! 

Quality of content has come down.. always watch your videos with high expectations little disappointed with the video this time.. u have set the bar too high for yourself. Hope you come back with a bang, great content in upcoming videos..

Very boring video. Find some interesting subject to discuss

We just elect our political leaders based on the caste, colour, region,money, interest, bribery.. for five years...How would you expect a sensible critique and response towards a 2 hrs movie.. matlab kuch bhi ho rahaa hai!!!!!

Googly movie scene was a comedy . U have mistaken it   . So try to get only bollywood movie scene if you don&#39;t know the language

Its saddening and shocking how some movies have made rape n domestic violence as a casual and inoffensive issue, moreover add a comic aspect to it! That&#39;s why most Indian men don&#39;t have a problem with occassionally slapping their wives/children and have zero idea abt what CONSENT actually means.Dialogues like &quot;Ladki ki naa m haa hoti h&quot;, &quot;Hasee to Phasee&quot;, &quot;Agar wo mud k dekhti h to wo b tumse pyar krti h&quot; etc. have deeply impacted society&#39;s views on women&#39;s genuine responses. Directors, actors ask ppl to not idolize such characters. But they&#39;re well aware of cinema&#39;s influence on millions of life.. yet they always blame it on the audience. I agree that audience discretion is necessary but why to strongly portray such behaviors in limelight and glory.

Tu kaunsi dekhne de gaya in 3no mai se

Meri Biwi Ka Jawab Nahi‍️. The awful dubbed dialogues of the actors....why!!!! Was never able to understand why

U must watch the Mahesh Babu and Amisha Patel starrer NAANI... n wonder how did this movie got approved. 

Har south Indian star ka naam Vijay ya Vikram kyun hota hai

Ghere is nothing lile censor board but certificate board, they are no right to cut scenes but can give certificate if A or UA

Bhai tu bhi kuch bhi



Every industry work on demand, audience like these act so why will they invest their money in such movies which will not give return.

When Indians were watching sexist movies in the mid ninties, Americans were watching Friends where they had one night stands, kisses, relationships, etc. Wow our culture!! 

before making videos and passing comments on a movie research about the industry. Googly movie scene which you have included is not right.  Would you add the scene if same dilogues were said by any hindi comedian(Johnny Lever) in a movie? The lady who played the granny role in googly is a versatile kannada comedian. The motive of the director was completely different than what you comment. Please learn our languages first and do a good research before shaming them. Sandalwood is better industry than shitty bollywood movies, googly doesn deserve to be a part in which movies like housefull are added.

Ooha movie, that guy is playing a negative character.. hence beating his wife.. so the perspective is different there.. the sridevi-akshay starrer must be the remake of a superhit Telugu film of Suman-Vijayashanti..in which the female lead plays a very strong and brave woman from a village, who voluntarily involves in solving the problems of people in her colony.. her husband is a police officer.. and as the story moves, they converge at both wife and husband being victimized by the villain and they work together to come out successful..

Ur presentation is most unique and extremely enjoyable

Or b like cmt milte ager hindi mein bolta

Hindi nehi ati tere Ko.       hafe. Hindi.     H     English.    Kush samaj nehi Aya brother

U what u r shit.

Please make video on Tollywood....now days mostoff watching dubed movie

<a href="">1:17</a> The girl right next to groom is what Ranbir Kapoor would look like if he ever dragged. Correct me if I am wrong. 

<a href="">3:20</a> brilliant bird

Making of Houseful 4 was a crime!

Bollywood audience are dumb! Look at South Indian movies and their audience!

I admire the way you deliver!

Oki, i got you on instagram jammypants4.  I&#39;m a cinema student and i really appreciate your work on this platform. Because whenever i want to see something on YouTube,i just checked your channel. And i really feel bad  about what is going on with bollywood, but also i feel good. Thanks for making such videos.

I am not an animal lover nor their advocate but Yes I was happily &amp; easily convinced with the bird taking revenge in the iconic Maine Pyar Kiya. I think I learned this in my school books that animals also have brains &amp; certainly emotions too.

Thanks very nice video good job may ALLAH bless you all the best 

The false rape accusal scene is also in 2020 Telugu film &quot;Sarileru Neekvvaru&quot; starring Super Star Mahesh Babu. The movie is a super hit. Thoroughly disgusting. The Mannequin sequence was reused in a 2001 Telugu Movie &quot;Daddy&quot; Starring Megastar Chiranjeevi.

Please play the clips after narrating...makes for a better viewing experience than just listening without the scene that you&#39;re talking about

To be honest I think that Actors who gets older should retire as they should give other younger people opportunities

Nice presentation

Our sensor board decides whether or not a sextual scene would be allowed on the Basis of how their dick react while seeing the particular scene 

Please review perfect blue

Yaar itna bolta hai utne me hi bore ho jata hu.. thoda chota video banaya kar...

Teri biwi ka sachi m kou jawaabi ni

O.k.

What&#39;s the storyline of ooha then?

Dear admin of this channel, even those schemes are digestible but if you ever have seen any Bangladeshi movies of 90&#39;s or even present days, you may get either mad or senceless thinking that how much non sence and non intelligence movies can be made . You can try 

Some one in comment section : children in my neighborhood love house full 4 My brain: I will be surprised in least manner if there mother is EKTA Kapoor

Tujhe film banana chahiye

Sale hindi me bol kaminey

Anmol, very few channels have your consistency and content quality. A good time to step it up in terms of quality, something closer to WATCHMOJO&#39;s listicle videos. Cheers!

Tero commentary sun ke lag ra constitution ka koi section sun re..

Well I am happy that Indian audience is now evolving and is now able to distinguish between shiity and brilliant movie. But still we are not fully prepared for good movies

I didn&#39;t use Instagram but i finally saw your pic in this video.

Vikram s movie is v disturbing! And stupid! Dunno y he did that telugu movie?! And even that kannada movie!

Video and your work was great but i didn&#39;t enjoyed the video coz of english!!

Is this Kunal Kamra????

Explains my mother&#39;s excellent decision-making capability. She worshipped this shit.

hey its not the indian audience ,its the one and only bollywood audience.

Bhai english bol ley ya hindi plz

You have a bit of Kunal kamra&#39;s voice.

Googly movie was just so good

Cocaine is a bad drug

Yr tu chutiya hai ....Kya animal badla nahi le sakta..?

Hell I am so disappointed by Indians

This is the very reason why I watch hollywood movies only.

What&#39;s the shocking dialogue ???

Housefull a franchise that gets progressively irritating Best thing said

Googly is good. You are just exaggerated

I wanted to watch tumad ao hard but was age ristrcted to me bcs i was 17 and some months

Why anime in India ?? Sensors bord

I watched your few videos. Your videos make sense

The last one had me

Tumbadd was not nominated I think. It was gorgeus.

Bhai hindi bolne me sharam aati hai kya

I love ur voice ️

Bruhh in googly they showed grandmas character sarcastically better watch whole movie and judge before commenting on south moviesIn ooha hero is an bad ass he always harrase his woman and movie is all about how that women changes him and turns him as a good human

You find accurate content like this every month shows how patriarchy flows in the veins of humanity

O bahi hindi me bola kr na.. kuya bkws ha yr..

Your voice is attractive ️

Bollywood does not equal all INDIAN movies

The &#39;q&#39; in the Bollywood stands for quality.

I have a friend who watched Housefull 4, and said it was awesome. I mean, how, really how can someone have such horrible taste in movies man????

Hey mate! Your videos are good and the creativity you put into is also remarkable. But the shitty background music in every video is really annoying. I hope you you would want to take it off from your next video. It really gets into the head.

What movie is the movie name shakti Kapoor scene ? <a href="">4:22</a>

Line from Gangs of Wasseypur was so accurate &quot;sala hindustan mein jab tak salima hai, log C^¥+!ya bante rahenge&quot;

Tu long my ilaychi

Jb English hi bolni h to fir hindi q bolta h.  Ya fir hindi hi bol

House full4 is such a stupid movie we left the theater halfway through. What a waste of money for both movie goers and movie makers.

Maine pyaar kiya was 80&#39;s dude.......not 90&#39;s

Hindi me bataoo

Everyone would start raping who they are attracted to if it ends up in marriage, my god what a stupid scene from the movie !

Bakwas video.. waste of time.. aise kuch illogical chize har ek movies me hote hai.. ye koi nayi baat nhi hai.. kuch achha video banao bhai.. views k lie kuch vi mat daalo.. disliked 

Yr voice is cute

The rape joke was digusting!

You are chutiya

Chutiya

Am I only one who feels bollywood is on a downfall rapidly?

100.2 K unlikes 

In fairness you can&#39;t censor a scene because it&#39;s stupid

Husband removes mustache wife fails to recognize him...Indian movie logic..

Akshay kumar said he felt so embarrassed during that movie released after decade he never came out of his house fearing for interview

Jammy Arnab won the Kuch Bhi. Last scene dude you got me 

<a href="">6:38</a> actually in reality there are some cases where high society girls did that with their boyfriend&#39;s 

Abe saale please do some real Job man... U r just boring and irritating

People in the comment section are pretending to be sensible.. on the contrary, they are the ones who go the theatre and watch such movies..Heights of hypocrisy...

Insb ko dekhkar lgta h ...srk aur kajol hi best h ....

Khule aam Rape ko promote kr rhey...to sazaa kyu denge...Bharat Ratna de..Kudos, to the condition!

Sir u can make a full video  of  matlab kuch bhi series on yaar gadaar rap song of saif ali khan

Housefull 3 was most favorite movie of mine till now in bollywood

pant ji ko....hariom Bahut research karte ho maharaj....jin movie ko Koi ni Dekh sakta only u got guts... kya kaha abla ka tabla???

Her also arnabI think he is a joke

Housefull 4 was the worst franchise ever made. Story line and screenplay were forced to match comedy.

Akshay Kumar ne pakadliya ki kaunsi nas dabane se public hall mai movie dekhne aayegi Saal ke pehle hi ek aysi content waala movie banao ko log jisse connect ho saake emotionally ... paisa kamao... emotions bechke Fir houseful 4 jaisi ghatiya slapstick humor banao... aur public to chutiya hai .... jaroor dekhne jayegi....aur wohi huya Isikiye content a66a hone par vi movies hit nehi hoti ... kyunki hum chutiye hai

bakwaas

Kya AAP ye saari movies dekhte ho ?uske baad videos banate ho?? Because... Hats off to you... Love you Jammy!.. ,,

These movie maker are &quot;b class ke c category ke log&quot;

It&#39;s important to note that these kind of disgusting and problematic movies get so much hype and audience because of all the A-list actors (eg: Akshay kumar) that work in them. These people literally have no conscience and would do anything for money‍

hahahahahah

why not u make some video in hindi

Housefull 4 is the worst movie I have ever seen

What about some nostalgia guiltypleasure movies 

Bro your videos are like quite good and catchy but the only thing will suggest you is language.. U can have a transition of language to hindi too..

Movie language: HindiContent language: English.Ajeeb chutiyapa laga rakha hai, Respect your language and cultureKeys of your success

Your voice sounds like Kartik Aryan

You are missing &quot;Pyazz ko muth maar kar khana chhiye&quot;

Can anyone please tell the name of music in the start of video?

Bhai Hindi me video banaoItani achi engreji samajme nahi aati

Wtf Grandma? Wtaf?

Dude. You should create the content in hindi. English isn&#39;t bringing that humour.

U speak English very fluently it&#39;s very good to hear awesome

Vhkl

What makes you think the birds cannot have memories? Do some research before creating your content. <a href="">

Googly

Your voice resembles with the singer of song kaash koi mil jaye by &quot; Faadu &quot;

I didn&#39;t laugh once watching house full 4...

These movie scenes show the mindset of &quot;rape culture&quot; that exists in our country.

Your video was kuch bhi

This guy intellectualise films too much go watch a documentary instead.

Bahar me Gaya this all informations, man u have a great voice ️️ in love with it

bhai hindi main bana lo videos plz

Housefull 4 was a total trash

Jammypants4!!!!!! ...wtf is this!???

Good researched content.. We can get countless such instances in our great movies. Interesting thread

You missed out mein prem ki diwani hoon wala scene where kareena is playing the guitar in sync with abhisheks piano piece and gives the expression as if she had cheated on Hritik. That&#39;s like WHAT???????

Good content jammy  keep up the good work.

Mai ablaa ho tablaaa nahi 

Ohhho

Bro plzz don&#39;t try to find logic in comedy scenes it is just a try to make u laugh@googly @housefull

I really love your voice (both in Hindi and English), also your content is excellent and you very well explain your point..I can see your hard work in everything!!Keep it up!️

Sooraj Barjatya has no sense of animal welfare. In Maine Pyar Kiya thst idiot had the letter pasted to the poor pigeon.

Subject and content should match in your video... Dabba video



That sigh after Houseful 4 

Bollywood movies are so shitty

The old women was a such a bitch in her old times

THE LAST SCENE FEATURING ARNAB WAS THE TRUE   CLICHE......XD

Can we say we should add your dialogue delivery to most irritating list of stuff as well? It&#39;s very bad

Has anyone else watched the trilogy of Human Centipede?

Hahaha... &quot;main abla hu tabla nahi&quot;... thank God I never watched the movie Bala

Bhai enlis enlis bol raha hai bhardwa

Thanks for this great topic to make a video on!

Kabhi Kabhi faltu movie dekhne main vi Maza aata hai 

<a href="">6:33</a> a crying kharbanda  rofl

The googly one is a joke about the elderly&#39;s opnion on rape victims,I don&#39;t think it should be here cause although it is regressive it isn&#39;t untrue

I think it was a very good decison by me to not watch House full 4... Such Chutiya Dialogues.... Iss se ache Jokes toh Rahul Gandhi likh lete hain... Aur Even Modi Ji.. 

The Arnab Goswami clip at the tho. 

Aawaj se Indian lagta h Hindi bolne me sharam aati h kya

I am a kannadiga ,I am not expected that scene of Google will come here 

That&#39;s problem of our society romance is become rape people first make you best of life then they destroy you in every manner . It&#39;s not only makes man life destroy it&#39;s female as well. If you got chance punish these people then so make  there king throne get throwne away. Make them live simple life like others . If you love someone don&#39;t shy to share life with him/her. Money Rich lifestyle it&#39;s only happens when we start chasing our dreams rather been dreaming

Can u make a video to explain the story saifali khan&#39;s agent vinod movie and why these type of oo7 movies can&#39;t buisness in india

The last bit which had Arnab was simply the best!

90s movies 

That granny advice! Holy Pigeon! 

Kabutar ne badla le liya. How is it illogical? Don&#39;t animals have memory?

Kash meri English thodi or achi hoti

Me laughing oly for JAMMYPANTS4 

I really laughed at the end.. googly? Uff... Kuch bhi..

Can u make vedio about Vikram sir ... he truly deserves ithe is undoubtedly one of the most talented and legendary actors of Indian cinema

Heyy maybe u should have a video focusing on the critical reviews by some of ur subscribers n show thier opinions and reviews upon some of the movies in recent timesss u would get a whole lot of content n plus we would be able to knw the mindsets of people around in detail

The marital rape joke got removed from &#39;Pati patni aur wo&#39; because it was included in the trailer and they faced a huge backlash from the masses but removing this rape joke from &#39;Houseful 4&#39; was the job of the censor board that they didn&#39;t do. I don&#39;t know how the censor board functions exactly,sexist and downright disgusting sequences get approved while Deepika&#39;s waist was covered in Padmaavat because of idiotic reasons.

Why not review of <a href="">#Kaithi</a> yet

Brother do the review of PARASITE movie. Best movie I have ever seen, may be !

Just a small suggestions,,,bich bich me armab ko dala karo,,,maza a gaya.

Bro you forgot. Sherlock peagon in rup ki rani choro ka raja

Makkhi badla le Sakti hai toh kabootar kyu nhi ..

Chutiya BNA diya

Ur just a party pooper ! Chill n enjoy the movies!! Or go watch Friends

Video is nice but your comic timing sucks 

Your voice is sme as oggy bike blogger

Bhai, you left out the most iconic, sexist, racist, patriarchal movie of the 80s...Naseeb apna apna. Who can forget a &quot;dark therefore ugly&quot; Radhika singing..bhala hai, bura hai, jaisa bhi hai, mera pati mera devta hai...

For ur kind info.....pigeons used to delivers messages earlier.... I think they r much smarter than the girls u dance with

Ur review for Maine Pyar Kiya was crap

The translation of googly movie was wrong

Housefull series is &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;orgy&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;teri biwi meri,meri biwi teri,thats all and these people do &quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;time travel orgy&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;...!!!!

It&#39;s just a suggestion... you can create a list of &#39;Matlab Kuchh Bhi&#39; episode with classic or famous Hollywood movies

Animal rights bro...Animal rights

Dear TARP , if you can I request you to do the controversy on kunal kamra and arnab goswami. Kunal has put forward the truth on his channel. Check it out.Edit: I know this channel is not about politics.

Same rape comedy is there in Sarileru Nikkervu 2020 Telugu movie...u shocked by Granny&#39;s advice????...see this then... advice is from own MOTHER 

When you talk about hindi movies...at least speak in hindi.

I have subscribed just for ur voice and the way u explain.... professor ban jaa bhaai...

Bollywood should learn something from tamil industry... Not copy

Voice and accent is so annoying

Kabootar ke emotions tum kya samjhoge

One thing I found interesting is the part about the pigeon. Escpecially given that Makhi (Eega) performed really well. It&#39;s all about the taking and the scene&#39;s importance in the movie

Googly will always remain one of my favourites ️ its an amazing movie

Not  all  Bollywood  movies  are  bad .   It  is  wrong  to  make  judgement  on  the basis  of  few  bad  movies .   I  don’t  think  censure  board  is  wrong   In  censuring  cuss words .    Censure  board  censures  ,  certain  cuss  words   because  films  are  mass  media  they can  have  wrong  impact on  ppl  below 18.   Plz  see  good  side  of  movies  to

Censor board is only for removing Om Symbol from flags.....they cut off anything which can make you feel proud as an Indian &amp; Hindu.

I came back again just to say ki plzzz review Code M.I really really love Jennifer but I really really love you too.. So wanted to know what you think about this series before I go and watch.

More kuch bhi&#39;s please

Rerlease series..n plsss review kites

If you think this dialogues/scenes are anyway near sexist, plzz watch Swiped by Noah sentenio just one time plzz . Plzz review that movie

As a woman and the daughter of a gentleman, I found that Housefull 4 scene so disturbing. I had no idea, not having watched the movie and I&#39;m shocked that almost no major artist has condemned it even once, considering how the former director is already an accused under the Me Too movement. Isn&#39;t Me Too applicable for men as well? Where is the equality?

I have not seen housefull 4, but after listening to the abla tabla dialogue, I wanna watch it.

Yash and Krithi are the best from kannada industry 

Matlab, KUCH BHI!!! 



Yea....... It was all disgusting but why don&#39;t you make video on sexist jokes about men??1) housefull 4 had a scene where actress kicks Akshay in the balls and he says tukde tukde kar diye! It is misandry and sexual abuse 2) many bollywood movies have scenes characters make comedy out of male genitals3) beating husband is portrayed as funny and boys even gets beaten for proposing a girlPlease make a video on all that

Well come back Sasish tharur

Sir please start another channel in Hindi...

Super man  photographer ?

Bro can you change your into theme/song.. I like to watch vids on autoplay and hearing that music again and again can get irritating

@Jammy can you please review the malayalam movie Anjaam Pathiraa? It is a crime thriller and right up your alley.

I love this matlab kuch bhi series 

Sab haasenge idhar. phir bhi housefull  4 dekhne jayenge. kyuki haaste rahna haiShocking audiances

After grandma&#39;s advice my reaction Huh!

Kabutar ne tab badla liya tha and usko woh abhi bhi yaad hai uske saarein rishtedaar hag ke jaatein hai puri duniya mein.

Googly 

In America and other countries= creepy grandmothers or a good grandmother character whom everyone will love.Grandmother in India = he is a good boy. I don&#39;t think he will rape you. If he does rapes you marry him immediately What the actual fuck.Xd just a joke.Don&#39;t take this seriously

Kannada films in 90s were disgusting u can make a few episodes on matlab kuch bhi series n u wouldn&#39;t have even covered half of them ‍️ googly dialogue still far better 

Reality...when congress on govt movie maker make movie to praise them ..and when BJP in govt they make it to praise them.... bollywood bhi biki hui hain...

Im dead at your reaction to housefull and googly dialogues.  

‍

Masses Masses Masses, you need IELTS classes

Dialogue writers should be more responsible while writing nowadays since more and more people are aware of what&#39;s happening in our surroundings and all of these affect us in some ways.

Lol that Instagram plug

This is cyber bullying... !! Leave the past alone don&#39;t haunt them buddie

How Good newz wasn&#39;t here...I mean some of it&#39;s dialogues ...and scenes....that were extremely ridicoulous...

@Jammypants4- You never cease to Amaze me, love your videos and love the fact that you include southwest Indian movies as well.

Before The Fly in Eega (Makkhi) there was a pigeon in Maine Pyar Kiya - The Ultimate Revenge Story. Like Eega, the pigeon deserved his own movie where he embarks on a journey to avenge his parents and wife&#39;s death.

You forgot to add Padaiyapaa movie scene where Rajinikanth teaching a lesson to Ramya Krishnan, how to behave like woman. And also Varalaru movie scene where Ajith Kumar&#39;s character Vishnu who had an creepy behaviour, he sees Divya&#39;s (Asin&#39;s character) cousin when she take an shower in the bathroom and wearing an scantily clad clothes. He  attempts to harassing her and raped her.. And also there is another scene where Ajith&#39;s character Shivashankar who is Vishnu&#39;s father. His mother arranged his son Shivashankar to marry Kanika&#39;s character Gayathri. But she reject him and does not wanted to marry him. Shiva&#39;s mother dies and she get to know that Gayathri rejected Shiva. After her mother dies, Shiva is getting angry, he attempts to raped and impregnated Gayathri. It is disgusting, creepy, scary and violent.Those scenes were considered as a shame, inappropriate, borderline problematic and regressive. Please add those three scenes in the Matlab Kuch Bhi video.

Grandmothet: If he rapes you, marry him immediately...Kriti : Abbey Daadi.

Please make another &quot;kuch bhi&quot; video for movies like- hum sath sath hain, gunda(mithun) , jani dushman, kya kehan, main prem ki diwani hun , prem agan etc etc 

...matlab kabootar ne badla le liya... loool

I’m not at all surprised Hahahah 

kuch bhi

I wonder what happened to all those women  who protested when salman khan made the rape joke (sultan)  after the release of housefull 4 .Nobody had any issues with a woman making mockery out of rape!

You shouldn&#39;t forget the marital rape joke enacted by the god of sexist characters Kartik aryan in Pati patni aur woh. Btw Anmol you should be more famous bro, you are a gem for cinema lovers. 

I simply love your &quot;Matlub kuch bhi &quot; narration 

Movies and comments apart I&#39;d say you look like an late 90s guy who&#39;d feature in English movies with his half sleeves shirt on. No offences

You Rock. I have never regretted using my mobile data for any of your videos. Keep it up. 

Matlab kuch bhiii

There&#39;s a movie of sridevi with Salman khanChandramukhi, where she is a fairy with magical powersShe loses some power gem and is sent to earth to retrieve before the villain gets itShe finds a young boy who is like 11 years old, she grows him up into Salman khan using her magic and the romances with himWtf Wtf Wtf

Rightly said at <a href="">4:15</a> &#39;lazy disguise in Rab ne bana di jodi&#39;...I really cud not understand the mentality.

Its good that you have included all language movies not just Hindi. I&#39;d love to see Tollywood movies get raosted so they come up with better scripts.

Fuck you asshole...mainay pyar kiya was the greatest movie....fuck you dumb fuck...yaraana was the best movie

Please see the Tamil movie Psycho

Love the way he says, Jammy Pants 4 !

Very chutiya video. You can get lots of videos like this in movie industry. Watch gunda or loha movie. The entire movie was made of such scenes that according to you shud not be approved. Keep some uniqueness dude.

Whole Housefull4 shouldn&#39;t be exist

As expected.....those movies were so creepy...

Thanks for providing the intro song link

Arrey granny ke advice ko yaad rakhte huye Kriti Kharbanda ne Housefull mein bhi usko implement kiya.... for all we know that was her input to the, uh, script. Btw, bang-on description of the franchise.

It&#39;s just arbitrary nothing else.

The googly movie scene was a joke... That&#39;s how overprotective grandmothers react.‍️

Jammypants bad then 4? Didn’t see that coming !!!Ok most of this nonsense are female downgrading Can u do a vdo with how men r regressed through toxic females and are taken as jokes

Worst movie of Bollywood history house 4.....

Maine pyar Kiya should not be in this list , when movie is made from emotional point if view you cannot apply intellectual logics

I still can&#39;t believe that kabooter scene

I&#39;m shocked that you are alive after watching all this movies.....I really want to know how could you watch these?

When are you going to review Tamil movie 96

Never knew Arnab is your fan too...matlab Kuch Bhi 

Sorry jammy. I couldn&#39;t watch this video in its entirety... it was just too much to bear. I salute u though for going through the torture  of putting it all together.

I love the way you say-&quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot;.. Hayee dil aa gaya️

Arnab bhadwa sab jaga hai aajkal

I really love your voice 

You don’t have anymore content kya? This must be the 10th video I have seen like this

Why don’t you review  bengali movies??

I like your content and videos, but if you make videos in Hindi it would get more views and appreciation.

How did you forget the Indian version of superman staring Puneet Issar Dharmendra it’s matlab kuch bhi ka kuch bhi

I watched googly many times but never noticed that dialogue.

2 Kriti kharbanda Movies I guess Kriti Kharbanda is always high on weed by reading Scripts 

Bollywood means &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39;.

can you plzz review Korean movie name parasite  I think this movie deserve Oscar ?? ..Love you review ..Plz do this ️

<b><a href="">#jammypants4</a></b><b>, dear friend how many movies you watch in a day?</b> 

if a housefly can take revenge y can’t a pegion take a revenge ‍️‍️ lol

3 cheers for bollywood.. Hip hip Sorry, sorryNo hurray

<b><a href="">07:21</a></b><b> seriously</b> 

that smoooth instagram plug in tho

Yahan dusre pair ka socks kidhar rakha nahi yaad ata...kabootar Ko flashback atey....

Oh grandmother

You suck in ur narration

<a href="">5:39</a> Kabir Singh is nothing compare to this

Dont make fun on pigeons please...have you forgotten only recently they caught an ISI trained pigeon?

Make video on Afsos (Amazon prime)

When i saw googly movie and this dialogue appeared... Kuchh v like seriously..was my reaction..

Mr. Jammy you should have watched the whole movie Vikram was a sadist in that movie that is a female oriented movie where vikram was the villain don&#39;t judge by just one scene

The job of the Censor board is to give the film an Age certificate. They shouldn’t be asking film makers to cut scenes. It’s up to the consumer if he/she wants to watch a certain movie

Well i just want to ask you.. how much such movies you watch and how u enjoy the torture ??

In a Vinod Khanna movie a race horse recalls how his father horse was killed by the villain and at the end horse murders the villain.

Hindi toh aise bolta hai humara bhai jaise ehsaan kr rha ho hindi pe

Bhai tu hindi me bhi video bana please...

jammy, first disappointment so far...wrong title for the content .i  could not watch it completely

<a href="">3:13</a> after that me seeing a pigeon Me: 

Kya Chu... yapa haai yaar 

But housefull 4 girls were so hot! You can watch it again for them 

Pls watch crime thriller Anchampathira movie..

The censor board has nothing to do with bad filmmaking. And the scene in the Vikram movie is the reality. You are so brainwashed that you want to be an ostrich and pretend that a problem doesn&#39;t exist. Then you get angry when sex scenes get cut and claim that they&#39;re only natural. You are nothing but a big hypocrite and a chutiya.

You should watch and enter the world of the gujrati film industry

@tried&amp;refusedproductions:why dont you make videos on the technicality of films? like which films had the best color grading, sound effect, long shots, camera angles.. you can also make videos on bts of those films... then there is stories behind making films... I think that would be helpful to many young makers and understand the premise on which the industry works..

And Akshay is also in movies that have social messages! Yeah sure... One movie should make you think , but another you should ignore! If we had that intelligence there wouldn&#39;t be &quot;fake news&quot;, voter turnout will be zero etcetera

Try the marriage proposal of Raj Kapoor to Nargis in the iconic movie Shree 420And the movie probably named Doodh ka karz starring Jackie Shroff as a snake charmer. Aruna Irani played the role of his mother. When Jackie&#39;s character was an infant and his helpless mother was breast feeding him, a hungry snake appears and Aruna gave him some milk from her own breasts. The snake fed the milk and thus became brother of Jackie due to that debt. You can also try the Bengali movies directed by Anjan Choudhary. After the death of Satyajit Ray the Bangla movie&#39;s income was based mostly on his movies. I just feel pity seeing the kind of roles the iconic actors like Soumitra Chatterjee, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Suvendu Chatterjee, Dipankar Dey, Mamta Shankar, Savitree Chatterjee, Rituparna Sengupta, Ranjit Mullick had to do do. Ranjit Mullick, who started his career with Mrinal Sen and even acted under Satyajit Ray is now a days a subject of meme due to his roles in those bizzare 90&#39;s movies. Even actors like Soumitra and Dipankar who were the blue eyed actors of Satyajit Ray had to play some horrible roles. And the actress Sreela Majumdar who once played some strong characters in Mrinal Sen&#39;s film was just used to signify an ugly poor unmarried girl anf a burden to her father in those movies.

being a kannadiga, you had me laughing to bits in the last sequence.. lol! Arnabs kuch bhi!

To me there should be no censorship at all

when will u direct a movie?

I really like your voice, it&#39;s very subtle yet intresting

For me the highlight of &quot;Maine pyar Kia&quot; will be when Monish bahl tried to rape suman n when Salman khan save her instead of being guilty Monish bahl asked prem &quot;k chl me to rape kr raha tha wo to normal a pr tune kyun bachaya Teri kya lgti a? Or party me I sare log Monish bahl ki bjae suman or prem ko judge krty ain

Actually ooha word is used to scold someone in Telugu.

OMG that arnab much bhi made me laugh so hard 

Bhai ye sab to thik he lekin antmam avengers bale kya karte he I mean look at antman a particle can take u to quantum world and there u can see talk they do more stupid if u apply proper logic

Avenging pigeon

U ashhole kuch bhi post mat karo

Nothing is wrong with dialogue in googly movie.. it&#39;s how dadi character thinks as he is rich and looks like a gentle man.. even you can see shock on the actress.. disbelieving it.

@<a href="">4:11</a> hell even i can&#39;t differentiate them

Review the malayalam movie LENS.I saw the trailer and seemed intriguing!!!

Please share some good South  movies

In ooha movie , I think Vikram is a villan  who is cheating on her and subjecting her to domestic and emotional violence .. he is not glorified in the movie for his acts.. that scene was showing his villainous nature to establish is character. I think it was bold of him to take up a role to portray the horror of domestic violence by being the abuser himself..

<a href="">2:15</a> Tanmay Bhat in red shirt

pls chnge your microphone

Meri Biwi Ka Jawab Nahin was released in the same year in which Sridevi did her TV debut with Malini Iyer. The producers wanted to capitalize on that so they completed the film, brought dubbing artists to dub for the stars. Both the main actors refused to dub for the film because the producers got rid of the director. This is a film where no credit given for the director! Despite the cringy dubbing, the outdated concept and all this, it is still better than 80% of the Bollywood films released today! Simply because it has Sridevi, the best star &amp; the most talented artist India ever produced.

Hey! Sorry to spam here, but just like JammyPants4 here I am also an upcoming artist. I have made a game and I wish to get more audience for this. It is completely free, no sign-up or email required. It would be great if some of you could install and try it. Link :- <a href=""> :- <a href=""> you!

Is it possible to make a totally politically correct movie in snowflake generation?

The Master of such content - ONLY DESI channel!! you should collaborate with him..

Pati, Patni aur Woh made have been in the list if they had not removed the rape joke. That was even more messed up than the house full one

House full 4 disgusting scene does kirti kharbanda have some respect or brains

When u accept ega movie y not kabutaar taking revenge??

Also then I saw mahesh baby&#39;s mpovie from Netflix it was a take on TC&#39;s minority report. But the movie has so much wrong. A public murder goes unnoticed by cops but the antagonist  has all the money to buy rex and do his living  with no trouble. A psychopath with no education  but has the resources.. and gets punished for murders. But the protagonist  killing his brother  in public  was ok.. u can do an episode of that. May be

The question is how these dialogues are approved? And when the actors/actresses read the scripts dont they object?

Ooha Scriptwriters are totally gone nuts! How can a Hero(Chiyaan Vikram) get so intollerant at this level?

Jammy ur videos r lit n this was also a treat ️

Chutiya episode aisa ku6 bhi to 1000 milenge issse bhi wahiyat

This video itself is.. Kuch bhi.. Kuch bhi..

Try pitahmugam. I saw it years ago and just the concept hits me even now. Of a boy raised in funeral grounds and know nothing but the anth mantras. And recites in happiness and sadness.  Brilliant.

Matlab kuch bhi..

I used to love David Dhawan&#39;s movies only to realise  growning up how sexist they are !

Just like Pakistan, India has two parts. One that is living in the present and the one that&#39;s stuck in the 70s. They will remain their until proper education is provided.

Matlab kuch bhi series is the best 

Housefull franchise gets progressively regressive.

The last scene should NOT be one of &quot;dadi ma k nuskhe&quot;

The scene in movie googly was made to be lame and to show stereotypes



Bro honestly your sense of humor sucks, anything mildly offensive and you&#39;ll think it&#39;s problematic. I understand that comedy is subjective but you seriously just can&#39;t take a joke, you&#39;re a proper librandi

Am I the only one who get confused between Tried and refused and Triggered insan?

Sahi mein had hai

That line in googly film was offensive but movie was good though..

Outright being offensive,regressive and border line problematic...this is my favorite line from now on

But Maine pyar Kiya is my favourite  aajkal kaha banti hai itni innocent pyari movies. 90&#39;s was best

Bro googly movie dialogue was sarcastically said, which you couldn&#39;t understand..

Itna samjh hai film making ke baare mai toh  film bana toh.

Apne aapko reviewer ya bahut baada critise samjh ta hai.

Bloody asshole.

Do some respected work don&#39;t critise another work.

Jammy pants ko kuch kam nhi hai isliye bhakchodi karta rehta hai.

That grandmother was surely high

<a href="">7:30</a> arnab&#39;s potential reaction to kamra..!

south lndian historic heart surgery scene plzzzz

Matlab kuchh bhi!!!!!!

Approved dialogue k bare me video tha dialogue kaha hai bhai sirf scenes hai

<b>lovely</b> 

Meri biwi ka jawab nahi Very Bad climax but excellent management 

Last one was the most pathetic

not pigeon. mohnish behl had that flashback

Bhai . Hatsoofff u literally  watch every  indian movie !!!

The iconic dialogue &quot; mai abla hu, tabla nai&quot; 

<a href="">5:52</a>The writing of this film challenges your intelligence 

This is getting highly disturbing now. I think putting up a disclaimer/disclosure/warning for the younger audience at the start of the video will be a better option.Love Your Work by the way!!

Madhuri just looked like Disha Patani. 

Your review of jamtara was not great .

You always save the best for the last....... I mean, what was that???!!!

<a href="">5:20</a> What was &quot;Matlab kuch bhi?&quot; here?So you never heard of Men beating their wives before?

GOOGLYROCKY BHAI.

CBFC is and should be the final authority on content...

Censor board toh masti mein bhi nahi tha

Housefull franchise: Where Heroes get older and older, Heroines get younger

<b><a href="">6:36</a></b><b> To </b><b><a href="">6:42</a></b> 

That MATLAB..... CHALO ANYWAY

I want to wear a &quot;matlab kuch bhi!&quot; Tee shirt.

OH mY GOd

2012 me Makkhi badla le raha hai! Kabutar to phir bhi thik hai!

Brother! all the long to find  logic disturbs Indians  because Pagalpanti bhi jaroori hai yar

&quot;meri bivi ka jawab nahi &quot; : this is very intelligent thinking but lacking technicality.

Matlab khuch bhi never gonna end because it is Bollywood

Man love your Matlab kuch bhi series.

Last one was really shocking..

that is not &quot;censor board&quot;  actually it&#39;s CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification)

Alright. That OOHA movie scene was traumatising. Wtf. :| Housefull and Googly scenes were equally disturbing.

The kannada movie grand ma&#39;s character is taken from her earlier movies where she is straight forward in these things hence this doesn&#39;t look irrelevant to that movie..

We have evolved...sort of.But Sajid Khan and Sajid Nadiadwala never has or never will evolve.

Kuch Bhi ?

You have wonderful voice.

Arnab in cameo?? Kuchbi !!... Kuchbi !!

Bollywood is Sexist, Racist, Nepotist and Homophobic.

The pigeon is indian deus ex machina 

Hmm attracting audience by clickbait. Not expected from you.

The engineering student in me couldn&#39;t ignore MATLAB.

Dam i so happy i didnt watch this mess of a movie. HF4.

Sound problem in your attach movie segments.

Sir u r amazing... Keep going

Anybody remember that magical punch of sahid kapoor in R Rajkumar that killed sonu sood

10 saal ke baad release karne ka kya point thaa????? ...usko poochoo jiske paise lage hai....not yours for sure . So it’s easy for you to say

Abe bs YouTube bacha hai kuch bada krne ko kisi bhi industry mein janee se faat rahai hai apni yrrr Wht u all think.....jezzz

Idk this youtuber voice is feminine....!

Explaination ke bich main follow me on Instagram it&#39;s jammy pants 

Loved the bonus one..can&#39;t stop laughing 

@jammypants4 please watch the film &quot;Himmat aur Mehnat&quot; starting sridevi and Jitendra where he rapes and he never even apologizes instead slaps her for trying to commit suicide. Also another film of Sri and jeetendra called majaal where jeetendra as a lawyer legally justifies marital rape. Kindly watch and review these movies

That pigeon deserves his own spinoff movie where he embarks on a journey to avenge his parents&#39; death.

You watched these movies!&quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot;

Watch Ye lamhe hai judai ke and professor ki Padosan. How they completed their incomplete films is hilarious (unintentional obviously)

Bollywood is a Trash except few movies..

Dude that Houseful 4 scene. LITERALLY I was thinking &quot;what the heck did they smoke before writing that?? and how on earth did these actors not have an issue with that line&quot;??? I didn&#39;t spend my money on that movie btw. It came on YT and  I watched it and I have no regrets.

<a href="">3:12</a> you talk about a pigeon taking revenge??? Imagine a housefly taking a revenge in Eega. Isn&#39;t that kuch bhi??

Welcome to Bollywood...  All the chutyapa of the world happens in this film industry 

In housefull 4 i laughed when hero&#39;s father in law said wo dekho sone ki chidiya and kissed hero&#39;s mother photo. 

Whole &#39;Housefull 4&#39; is &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39;.

Japan was giving world &quot;Phantom of Baker Street&quot; back in 2002 &amp; our production houses this shit

Japan was giving world &quot;Phantom of Baker Streer&quot; back in 2002 &amp; our production houses this shit

Plz see arsad warsi slaps the heroine in front of her dada ji

Must watch hero Hindustani, you will love it

Matlab kabootar ne badla le liya.. Matlab kuch bbbb

In luka chupi (2019)  Pankaj Tripathi knocks on the hero&#39;s door wanting to also do his girlfriend cause she is not his wife . The dialog &quot; hamein bhi who chahiye&quot; is utterly disgusting and regressive.

How do you manage to watch such movies..?? 

Indian audience deserves movies like Housefull 4

Hats off to the audience as well as because of them this movie became  the massive hit. So why to blame censor board and all. Blame Indian audience

Wtf man,,I am persuing btechAnd i watched housefull 4 with my friends,,whole time we were laughing at savage dialogues,,how can u say movie not worth itIf can&#39;t get a laughter,,u r depressed as hell

Oh my God. The exasperation with house full 4 is so well timed. Actually this series is depressing even if i always lough.

Did u intentionally put kirti kharbanda&#39;s clips side by side... One in which c is advised to use R*** for marriage n one in which c actually uses it?

I think your intro is amazing but you should change the display pic of your channel a newer version btw amazing work!

Was Vikram anti-hero in that movie?

No one can beat mithun

About GOOGLY - the grand mother and the girl were strangers. Yash drops them. (just wanted to clarify that they were not relatives)

Hahahaa I liked it how you brought up our Kannada movie too in this..where as from one point of view I love Googly movie , and the other point of view where granny advices, it was definitely kuch bhi kinda dialogue 

Other : Mene pyar Kiya Tried and refused productions fan : kabutar Ka badha (dhugud dhoom dhugood dhum thrururur thrruur)

In Veeram Tamil movie the brothers convince Tamannah&#39;s character that Ajith Kumar&#39;s character can speak to birds and animals. This same movie is being remade in Hindi as Bacchan Pandey

So you mean to tell me Bollywood had a scene where they racist or prejudice against South Indians? Wow

It&#39;s hypocritical to ban art movies based on dark subject matters and then allow this garbage run wild in the cinema

Housefull 4 200cr+ nTumbaad 12cr+

Hahahhaha ..kuch bee..ending nailed it..hahaha

Before Eega(Makkhi), there was Maine pyar Kiya ---- A Revenge Story:)

You should watch the entire kannada movie googly, then you&#39;ll realize how stupid and sexist it is.. It&#39;s the birthplace of characters like Kabir Singh

Sir why dnt u just make a series on illogical and bizar dance steps and logics in indian songs that would be really funny i suppose

Pls movie clips bhi dikhaya karo with voice/dialogue..it would be more better and entertaining

Kriti Kharbanda 2 points 

U forgot to mention de de pyaar de

Hey Jammy. I&#39;ve been following your work for few months and I really like it. I would like see your opinion on a recent Tamil anthology &quot;SILLU KARUPPATTI&quot;. It&#39;s on Netflix.

Except that one line &quot; marry him&quot; from Googly. Googly is one my favourite movie in Kannada, and i have watched around 50 movies. You will seriously fall in love with Yash and Kriti.

Censor board is like a broken key from a keyboard. Either it doesn&#39;t work or it totally spams.

Only Desi has such a hilarious take on Maine Pyar Kya (among other Bollywood movies) that had me in splits. Good to see TRP digging on the &quot;kabutar&quot; here :D

House full should be full movie - Kuch bhi not just one scene

Bro watch psycho Tamil movie it&#39;s really awesome

Hey man! You said you were disappointed with Imtiaz Ali remaking his old songs. Just go listen to &#39;shayad&#39; and &#39;haan main galat&#39;. Of course, you were wrong.

You missed the scene in Sivakasi Tamil movie where Vijay critiicizes Asin for wearing shorts and sleeveless . Before she was touched by a man and blames here clothing for that man touching her

Brother watch &quot;HERO&quot;&quot;TAMIL MOVIE...its on Amazon Prime..a very good movie

Censor board - me chutiya hu!!!!!

Why the dulhan in the 1st movie looks like ranbir kapoor 

matlab kuch bi

Kuch bhi 

Plz make video on best action sequence And chase sequences.

That scene from googly made me cringe so hard

You really have a great vocabulary ! You are so freaking fluent at it ! My my...

I loved googly movie

-|=|-            -|=|-            -|=|-

Do something  productive. Idiot

Srously! Housefull sucksssss!!!‍️

A post with hilarious sad scenesThis one was 

Ch*du banao scheme of Bollywood 

Next video hindi ????

Houseful 4 creeped me out so much through that rape scene basically they were mocking the rape victams by writing such scene can&#39;t believe in today&#39;s we have to see such disgusting scenes

Bollywood creates WTF moments Amol - I&#39;m about to make a &quot; Matlab Kuch bhi video &quot; 

I cringed throughout the video!

hey if you are interested in suspense thrillers you definetly should watch these two telugu movies1.mathu vadalara2.agent sai srinivasa athreyaThese two are very good you will love them and both the movies are available in amazon prime

A rape joke scene in H4 is tribute Sajid khan.

You should watch sarilerunikevaru train scene and rip

Joker in dark knight party scene Joker :- i only have one question.... Where is the million subscriber this guy deserves... 

Grandmother&#39;s seen was made is comedy...

For Kuchh bhi episode Kabir Singh (Arjun Reddy) Deserves a special episode

1st film was a remake of a telugu film.

Censor board allows these illogical elements but when it comes to people working from pakistan they will have a problem

Censored board should name change to Cancer board bcoz the only thing they censor is Cancer product

Anyways...achcha scene pr aate hai..

Thank you for this!! :P

Bhai indian most underrated movies par video banao na please

Rape ko mazak bna liye hain saale!!!!Actresses taiyyar kaise ho jaati hain aise role ke liye!!!!

Good

Boring!!

Crying karbanda. 

Bro I love your work but do you think Bollywood will ever change... No man this is not reality

Jammy : follow me on Instagram.. Me : KUCH BHI ..

You only give your narration. Why don&#39;t you also show us the actual scenes! That would be more fun right!

so wrongly entitled

Kriti Kharbanda once said she had desire to slap Hina Khan because of her comments about South Indian Movies and the industry, yep Hina Khan sometimes talk trash and senseless without information but Kriti also is very much egoistic and bad taste of taking roles in Movies. I watched some of her movies and recently Pagalpanti (I didn&#39;t finished that movie), most of the roles she really protray woman as dumb and have no brainier type and yes she have some attitude problem also. I don&#39;t know what to say when celebrities like Kriti talks about women empowerment, also does movies where directors protray women as an object rather than human and they just be like &quot;movie mein Sab chalta hai&quot;, how irony and Hypocracy it is.

Check scene of hamla movie in which goons attack on Dharmendra car .. it’s fucking illogical as car was bullet proof and goons when understand it they break the car with hammer ..

This guy Farhad samji thinks he is a genius what a deluded man

When your country&#39;s supposedly &quot;cultured&quot; elders make rape victims marry their rapists, of course, horny &quot;cultured&quot; men are going to rape.

Bhai... Abhi bas hogaya... Bahut paka raha hai tu... Ab kuch naya kar

thank god there are people like you who have that guts to say it out loud that this is seriously f-in &#39;KUCH BHI&#39; yaarrrr...

WTH, Ooha? I’ll never watch that flick just for that scene. Is he a bad guy in the movie or something? Who the heck would write that for a good guy? Sheesh.

You missed bengali movies  just watch any bengali movie released between 1990-2010 . I guarantee you&#39;ll get so much content for your upcoming videos in this series.

Bobby Deol looks like Lord Farquad from Shrek

Animals are smart and have good memory and it&#39;s scientifically true

Career ho toh David Dhawan jaisa. Saala ek toh hit filmein banao aur paisa kamao. Phir unhi filmo ka remake apne bete ke saath banaake hit karao aur paise banao.

KUCH BHI.....matlab KUCH BHI....

Now, I&#39;m traumatised after what I saw...

Jammy can you please react to Vir Das&#39;s latest comedy special???

The &quot;B&quot; in Bollywood stands for B grade.

They censored madarchd and some casual kissing scenes in kabir singh but didn&#39;t censor any english cuss. And they have absolutely no problem with those unnecessary bob vagene shows in movies like mastizaade, grand masti, kya kool hai hum series etc.I think our censor board is full of horny old uncles &amp; aunties jinke khudke 17 bacche hai but still they object two consenting adults standing together holding their hands

I wait for your Matlab Kuch Bhi Episode more than any other videos.

In Tollywood  version of kick 2Ek kabuthar hi hai main hero And he kills the main villan in the end for killing his lover kabuthar  

The granny at the end seemed to have had some experience in the matter. ;P

Bhai love ur videos

Video Idea : I am not sure if you have watched Mani Ratnam&#39;s Tamil movie &quot;Iruvar&quot;, please do watch and get blown away with all technical aspect.. i would love to see your take on it... as your views are very similar to mine.. :)

Can you find a &#39;kuch bi&#39; scene from a malayalam movie?

Houseful 4 Puri movie ban kar Deni chahiye thi. It&#39;s a.......... Undefined

My father always jokes that back then he used to watch a lot of movies with his friends and whenever they Raj Babbar appeared on screen, they&#39;d proclaim &quot;ab rape hoga&quot;. ;P ;D :D

Ye episode tabtak chalega jabtak tumhara vakchodi chalegi

And I thought, I can watch it with family.

&quot;OOHA&quot;. Lol! That&#39;s such a double meaning name.

Jammy please make a video on Best movies/series to watch on Netflix with review! 

Rishi Kapoor was probably inebriated in reality.

You can literally make a lifetime, out of these &quot; Maltab kuch bhi&quot; episodes.

Plz make a video on rockstar

Did you just doubt the intellectual and capable capacities of a pigeon?? Unsubscribed

  Arnub: <b>&quot;KUCH BHI!, KUCH BHI!!&quot;</b>

Censor Board has always been on weed.

<a href="">7:19</a> lol So this was what yash doin before becoming rocky

Maine Pyaar Kiya should have been called &quot;Kabootar ka badla&quot;.

For Yaraana, Raj Babbar nominated for best negative role at filmfare awards, but i didn&#39;t watched the movie though.

Lagata app video banaoge

Maii bhi dekhen gaya tha Housefull4 andd also seen this scene and mujhe tabhi

Mere Biwi Ka Jawab Nahi. Christopher Nolan and Sam Mendes can take some tips on camerawork from this movie.

Even i thought the houseful 4 scene was really disgusting

&quot;Mere Biwi Ka Jawaab Nahi&quot; - Boney Kapoor during interrogation of Sridevi&#39;s death.

<a href="">7:19</a> enu idu?

Indian cinemas shows the mentality of the generations...and versatility... And you r doing a great job by bringing up this .

Thumbnail related video part <a href="">6:24</a>

Housefull 4 200 croreSection 375 15 crore Tumbad 12 croreThis is reality of our indian audiance

So many of Yash&#39;s movies have similar dialogues.. maybe not about rape but about how women should dress, behave etc. So cringey!

You should make these series on a weekly basis it&#39;s really great

Pahlaj Nihalani seem like a saint now.

You should watch Sarileru neekevvaru, Mahesh babu starrer for this kuch bhi series.. the whole heroine and family episodes will be just like Arnab shouting kuch bhi..

I was waiting for this category aur soch raha tha kyun nahi video ban raha hainBan gayaBird flashback is just out of the worldWhat angers me is, when many men are still trying to fight for the equality and dignity of women even after being labelled as &quot;dogs&quot;,there are brilliant minds who still think that making a rape joke or even creating a situation out of it in movies is bloody disgusting.Worst part is many audiences still view this as stress busters and many enjoy this kind of comic  dialogues...Hats off to these moviemakersThank you for the Matlab kuch bhiiiiiiiiiii(to the power of infinity)video of the <a href="">month.At</a> least your presentation made me laugh

Indian movie makers will never improve cause it&#39;s we who only end up saying matlab kuch bhi and do nothing...

Most South movies don&#39;t have much by way of logic anyway. Tamil and Telugu especially.

children in my neighbourhood  literally love housefull 4 and will defend this movie at any cost....this disturbs me

Is Shraddha Kapoor really Shakti&#39;s daughter?

<b>Matlab kuch bhi</b> permanent. Baaki sab temporary. 

I think the dialogue in houseful 4 was something like&#39;aapne mujh abla ka tabla baza diya&#39;

Bhai jis time p ye movies approve hoti h tb censor board wale ganja fook kr aaya hua hote h

Well in housefull 4 ..era which was shown was  100s of years back ..not justifying i myself hate these nonsense movies but just saying

I just love your work️

Even that pigeon had a better IQ than Salman bhai.

Aisi grandmother ho toh kitne rape case kam hote hai.. Matlab kuch bhi

IT&#39;S THE TIME FOR MATLAB KUCH BHI HEHEHEHE

Bollywood has literally risen on the backbone of B grade cinema if you think about it.

Love the anglicized Hindi of Jammy.

Another matlab kuch bhi....  

The Last two were so fu*king idiotic .

None of these still top Gunda and Deshdrohi. Hollywood may have The Room. But India has Gunda and Deshdrohi. All time classics.

Seeing Bobby Deol in the thumbnail, I remembered a film called Nanhe Jaisalmer in which a child tour guide is a die-hard fan of Bobby Deol. If that doesn&#39;t personify &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot;, I don&#39;t what does. ;P

The bonus scene from GOOGLY takes the cake, Matlab KUCH BHI! ‍️

Jammy Bhai may God bless you

Sensational trp

Akshay Kumar deserves all the kudos in the world to make it as an A list actor on his own strength after doing a lot of B and C grade films to survive. Rather than a certain star who always had the patronage of YRF and Dharma.

Omg hi

When you&#39;re so early that you don&#39;t know what to say?!  Btw this is my first time that I&#39;m so early &amp; I feel like this is an achievement in itself

Matlab Kuch bhi is  back
