Just wanted you to know that it&#39;s okay if you make typos in the comments below, we&#39;re all watching this with tears in our eyes 😭

Unique bangla cinema o korechen
Irfaan sir gone too soon..Aapki kalakaarintonhai hi uske saath aapki smaile bhi dil ko hamesha chhooti rahegi...And also been a fan of Parna as well and Tisha is fab as well.. Watched some webseries of Tisha as well and i muat say she is maazing ..Lots of love ❤️ from 🇮🇳..

It can&#39;t be called what Irrfan Khan does in this movie!! It&#39;s hypnosis, it&#39;s magic, it&#39;s one of those things you sleep replaying and dreaming about. Irrfan was the greatest to have ever done it.

Most of the people here don’t even know the plot of this movie is on True events.

Nice movie

Bogus film.
Nusrat Imrose Tisha 🤍🔥🇧🇩 my favourite
Irfan Khan you&#39;ll be always in our ♥

Just watched it on Netflix. Came here to meet people who are equally in tears. 🥺

Miss u sir Ji irrfan Khan
Farooqui and Trisha's strange distorted Bengali pronunciation should be a case for Khabana, Pabana, Yabana. All the film industries of the world try to retain the pure pronunciation and sweetness of their own language. But in every Nakt-film of Faruqi and Trisha, it is hateful to hear Tisha's broken Bengali. Khaba , Yaba, Paba, these are not Bengali words. These words do not have any regional language.
Poor direction, below average cinematography, laggy-forced dialogues, insufficient bgm. Only good thing is the color grading that creates a melancholic mood.  Having a hyped plot based on real life character is not enough. With such great cast it is a below average film.

This movie is so bad

We&#39;ve always wanted to see this film in our country on big screen.Still now we&#39;re expecting someday It&#39;ll get released in our country.This film deserves much more appreciation and attention.We are being deprived of this master piece.

This is from a legendary Actor and a legendary Director.

This movie 💜💜💜💜💜
Tisha&#39;s acting is just to of the sky. Truly an &quot;actress&quot;

After Jane I felt like you are my favorite actor😭😭
I miss you badly Humayun Sir!I miss you badly Irrfan Sir!

The best

Bangladeshi Movie Doob♥️
Truly a magnificent blend of Mostofa Farooki&#39;s directing and Irrfan Khan&#39;s acting, both brilliantly capturing the essence of the story. RIP Irrfan Khan, one of the best actors and a legend. He&#39;s genuinely the best Indian actor I&#39;ve seen in my short life and the best Bollywood actor in Hollywood.

Which neighbourhood in London out of curiosity as I too live in London

This movie&#39;s Based on the last life of Humayun sir 😍😍

Bangla ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chirkut's ``Ahare Jeevan'' in the background music. 🎶🎶
As a man he was like a god 💔😞
This legendary actor is doing a movie in our country called &quot;Doob&quot;. Every Bengali will remember your memory through this movie for the rest of his life. You will be fine wherever you are, sir. ❣🇧🇩

It&#39;s a Bangladeshi film. I&#39;m from Bangladesh. When I saw that film it almost felt like Irrfan Khan sir was speaking bangla since his childhood. The film was a masterpiece. Infact it&#39;s still a masterpiece ❤️ Such an amazing actor. We&#39;ll miss him. Lot&#39;s of love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩

Nothing came to the society but it felt good after seeing it.
Irrfan

<b>&quot;one can save millions, but sometimes millons can&#39;t save one&quot;</b><b>RIP</b> - Irfan khan

Releasing on?

Miss him so much
Omg it&#39;s a real life story based movie. Late Humayun ahmed was anwell known writter who married his daughter&#39;s friend at his old age. His daughter was extreamly talented but she left the media after her dad and friend made the sandal ...

Irfan sir was a legend. He was the great Indian Actors of last decade.No one can replace you sir🙏RIP💐💐🌹💐💐

🙏🙏💕💕💓💓😭😢😁😃😃 Legendary Irfan Khan Sir
LEGENDS never die. You can still find them in the MASTERPIECES they have created.

IRRFAN SIR!

Revolutionary road

I beg you @Netflix, please dub this masterpiece in hindi.🙏🙏🙏

Omg only if I have the courage to watch this after this gem the star we’ve lost

I don&#39;t understand bengali but I m only here for irfan😞

irfan sir love you sir
Watched the movie in Netflix. Absolutely marvelous! Mostafa Sarwar Farooki is a great director, and Irfan Khan is one of the BEST actors of international cinema! Irfan Khan portrayed the character of Javed Hassan in a way that seemed so real! The story is captivating. What I liked most is that the director focused on the emotional turbulence of the family rather than on the scandal. The reactions of the wife, children (especially Nusrat Imrose Tisha in the role of the daughter), their struggle to overcome the shock and humiliation, and finally reconstruction of their lives is treated with dignity and amazing strength! Hats off to the director and the entire team. We miss Irfan Khan! He&#39;s gone too soon. And Nusrat Imrose Tisha is amazing, as always!!

I am a simple man.. I see Irrfan khan in a trailer, I like it even before watching it.

He is ni more...  😥 painful i don&#39;t know why why my eyes started crying when i think or see irfan sir..  May now i realize he is a best actor...  And the story end ,past ,gone 😫

Loved his work 🔥

Irfan sir..... ❤❤❤❤😥😥😥
i heat bangla bangla
Can’t believe he’s no more 🥺

Hey friend, please make it in Hindi also.
Narcotics Control Bureau will file the first charge sheet in Sushant Singh Rajput case.


Narcotics Control Bureau is going to file the first chargesheet in Sushant Singh Rajput case after 180 days. According to sources received from the agency, the central agency will file this charge sheet under the NDPS Act. According to sources, the names of the accused arrested in September and October last year will be included in this charge sheet.


After the suspicious murder of Sushant Singh Rajput last year, CBI started investigating this case on the demand of Bihar government. The Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau were attached to the case as associate agencies after indications of financial fraud and use of drugs were found in the case. NCB worked most actively in this case.


All the activities of the Enforcement Directorate and the main investigating agency CBI have been stopped in this case for the last six months. If NCB files a charge sheet, the names of Rhea Chakraborty, Shouvik Chakraborty, Jayanti Saha, Deepesh Sawant, Sandeep Singh and Samuel Miranda can be included in it. Among them, Riya, Shouvik, Deepesh and Miranda are released on bail.


NCB also arrested many drug peddlers in this case but till now the agency has failed to reach the main kingpins. So far 33 accused have been arrested in this case. Three of them were arrested last week itself. Hrishikesh Pawar's name is also one of the accused arrested last week. Hrishikesh was Sushant's associate director.


Karan Sajnani, a British citizen of Indian origin, was also arrested in this case. 200 kg of imported marijuana was recovered from a person named Ali in Uttar Pradesh. Ali is also linked with Karan along with Rahila Furniturewala.


Apart from actress Dia Mirza, Rahila has been the manager of many other Bollywood celebrities. The suspicious murder of Sushant Singh Rajput took place on 14 June 2020. Since then, three central agencies of the country are working on this case. Agencies have not been able to get any major success so far in Sushant Singh case.

Miss you sir
Proud to be a Bangali

He is still alive in his characters, it is said that Irrfan has not left this world.
You are not here but your lovely acting is forever

You know how big even among legends he was that he declined to work in movies like Interstellar and The Martian.The three khans of bollywood Irfan Khan, Amir Khan and SRK.He was the best in the three khans.

1.5 million views in 2 days wow. I didn&#39;t appreciate his acting until I re-watched one of his films. One of the best actors India ever produced. Saying hi from Turkey 🇹🇷.

Do the trailer in hindi..

Does anyone have any medicine here to stop the pain in my heart while watching this ..

I don&#39;t understand bengaliBut that&#39;s the good thing about Irrfan,People don&#39;t need a language to understand him 🌼

Probably the first movie released long after demise of an incredible actor ❤️

we lost a GEM , irreplacable IRFAN &#39;Great&#39; Khan
Wow I had no idea that Irfaan’s last movie is set to release and I thought Angrezi Medium was his last one 🤭 can’t wait to watch it 😭

Thankyou for this trailer.... RIP legend😇

Brother, who is healing people's wounds?
When will this movie release

I&#39;m not a Bangali but trust me I understood each and every sentence of this trailer without seeing the subtitles. That&#39;s the power of Irrfan sir&#39;s  on-screen presence.

Love you Irrfan sir

Yeh to Bangladeshi movie hai

Still don&#39;t have courage to watch his movies...Why he gone so soon..😞

Salut

Anne Frank said - &#39;Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude.&#39;Hope we will learn how to appreciate and cheer up the authentic gems like him before they die/ before it gets too late.WE NEED TO WAKE UP BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE. &lt;3

But when did he shooted for this movie??Did he came back from heaven??❤️😍❤️❤️

I met him a few days before he passed away, it was a chance meeting as he lived in my neighbourhood in London. I greeted him and said, if we could have a photo, he said &quot;photo leke kya karoge, social media pe lgaoge - guftagu kijiye, saari zindagi ye mulaqat yaad rahegi&quot;, then we spoke about his experience in London and I will simply never forget his words...

This is how legends come from heaven 😭
