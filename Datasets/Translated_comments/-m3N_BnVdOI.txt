Fake AF looser!

Holy shit, is indeed the correct reaction 😂

Fake

This is the ogest videos of my childhood

Omg 😲 😱 I have heart atak !

He was scared but at the same time the shark literally turned away from him

I really don’t blame this guy for screaming. I would have shat myself too

Insane. If that guy was in there for a few more seconds he probably would have died

just a reminder that this video is purely doctored. It&#39;s not real. Cool nonetheless

What a stupidity. No  🧠 ?

You were so damn lucky..!!
Shark was like chill I’m not gonna hurt ya

How bad can your timing be lol. He jumps, friend is like “hmm maybe I should check the water now “

This is a vollege video edit

Well, that's it, this idiot won't climb over the fence anymore. 😂
I don&#39;t think that shark was hungry - it was just having a look see

The &quot;ohlbkbjbkjbnkjnkjn,mnkjndlkdm&quot; was legendary

It proves the whole splashing theory it wasn&#39;t that intrested in him until he was splashing all over the place...

bro he didn’t even fight the shark he kind of just splashed it away and i’m pretty sure the video is fake like they used an editing software or smth

It&#39;s fake! When goes under wather you can the waves are not coherent with the calm sea in the surface.

Fuck that

Shark: hey man I don’t think I recognize you at all but uh welcome to the harbor I guess. Anyway nice meeting you. Him: BLURUUROOUUGHHHHHH

Guy TV loves you
<a href="">0:59</a> DANG THE SHARK HAVE PORTAL ABILITIY TO TELEPORT

Where&#39;s the part where he fights it off ?

&quot;White Shark Do It Again !&quot; Instead of the Doobie Brother&#39;s song,  lol😅

what broke it for me is this dude straight like an I, finger pointed at the sea like he is some anime hero, screaming &quot;SHARK&quot; as if it was some hollywood trailer line while any normal human being would just tell his friend to get out of the water or something

A lucky guy😂

Does no one know this is fake? Also this is used in like 50 different fake shark videos

By the way it was video editing for people who think a man can jump directly into a shark like that lol

When Death passes by your side.

He took way to long to get out of the water,Fake.I seen an 80 yo lady move out of the water faster.

Definitely was a juvenile didn’t even look like it wanted to attack him

If the word panic was a video

Looks like BS.

who came here from sambutcha

Shark : why are you running ? Why are you running ??Man : &quot;That&#39;s Spielberg&#39;s fault.&quot;

Sharkbait clickbait.
there was no &quot;fighting off&quot; a shark. it didn&#39;t even take a moment to acknowledge you. he just swam right past you 😂

&quot;You&#39;re my hero...&quot;   - her

Well he has clearly played enough shark evolution to look around when leaving the waters…😂💯

Well he has clearly played enough shark evolution to look around when leaving the waters…😂💯

i went swimming here today 😭😭
MEGA FAKE VIDEO 😂

its fake though

Land probably never felt so good

Misleading title for views. You didn&#39;t fight the shark. It only spared you because sharks don&#39;t hunt humans. You could have just calmly swam away instead of splashing so much and attracting its curiosity.

&quot;🦈&quot;&quot;Namanmaimniamnmami&quot;&quot;🦈&quot;&quot;     &quot;
Too bad it’s fake and the shark spliced in to the footage.

I don&#39;t know about this one. It looks like the shark is post production.

The shark swam into the rock wall and disappeared.   😂

Camera man never dies
like this if you see the shark before he jumps in!

The sharks “dude wtf are you doing in my house”

Do I really need to explain that this video is edited?

I hate clickbait titles.

this guy&#39;s a moron

Caveman mode unlocked
I remember the first time I watched this I was sat on the shitter. It helped. Turns out it’s fake

Fake off
And he looks around at the tranquil bay with the nice yachts and the pretty coastline. It&#39;s as if nothing happened. Suddenly we realize how quick we are ended. How little we matter to the greater world. That shark could have engaged and maybe even drowned him. But ten minutes after, it&#39;s all quiet and serene and beautiful. Ah Nature.

Lesson learned. Let the other guy jump first and wait a good 2 minutes before jumping. As far as the comment below, sharks aren&#39;t vicious. Sharks are stupid. It&#39;s like being attacked by a Opossum. It&#39;s an American marsupial. Known for their very primitive brain. So with sharks. It&#39;s about a tenth as smart as any of the small whales or dolphins. It has hardly changed since before the Chicxulub Meteor extinction.

He should try it again

If this is not a montage 😮, then you are real fools, in Australia white sharks are just 5-meter monsters that eat seals, it’s good that you are so lucky, it’s good that it didn’t eat you like so many people
Can&#39;t remember where, but I saw this video get debunked somewhere. The only thing that might be real in this clip is the jump off the cliff - the shark parts are edited in.

I didn’t see a fight, I saw a man bomb into a bay then sh*t himself when he saw a shark. Nowt to worry about really… if that great white we’re hungry you’d be dead before you knew it

Apparently swimming means fighting over there

Genius, and terrifying every time. I did believe it, although my initial skepticism was aroused firstly by the tone of the high five and again later by the reaction of the swimmer once he was out of the water. But hey I don&#39;t know the guys, maybe being within centimeters of a prehistoric killing machine that&#39;s deciding if it will eat you doesn&#39;t evoke copious amounts of panic, fear, and terror in them? Some people are chill as. The rest of the footage worked brilliantly and I was ready to argue for its authenticity.

I actually jumped off this exact spot I live near it

Fake but well done

Don’t look like he’s fighting off anything 😑

Pretty well made anyway

I’d be to scared to make a move to escape worrying about my toes 😂

Phhhuuuuck that!!!

This fight could have been easily avoided by beholding the beauty of that monster from that pier above or a jetty below. The handsome studmuffin did not have to jump in his home, then shout at him.Jokes aside, Aussie man balls must weigh a ton!

&quot;man fights off shark&quot;...you mean dumb fuck discovers that white sharks live in the ocean.

Clickbait title. The shark was just having a look, nothing more.

I have no way of explaining this, but when he turned his camera around to face him again at the end, that felt like a very Home Alone reaction.

People without kidding belve this

I don’t understand why anyone would want to jump in the WAATAA in Australia when everyone knows Great White Sharks swim near shore? It baffles my mind.

I love how he’s scared out of his mind while the Shark is like “ah what a lovely day”

There is NO fight people. Im reporting for clickbait

Even though this video is fake, this stuff happens all the time when we&#39;re swimming in the sea, sharks swim near us and we never know about it. Sharks have zero interest in eating us.Next time you go for a swim, know that a massive white shark might be swimming around you.

That jump was high, damm dangerous, no way could i jump from that height.

Stuff not adding up.  I say fake!

Screaming under water was probably the worst thing he could have done. They are attracted to SOUND

So this man swam with a shark?

The shark was lucky that the guy had already had lunch earlier that day.

Strunz
HEROOOOOOOOO 💪💪💪💪💪
too clean to be Sydney harbour. He he. And i don&#39;t know too much about sharks so i could be wrong but it doesn&#39;t look like a great White.

Is this real??

First of all why u scream in the water u know they can hear u -_-

Dude stay the phhhuuuuuckkkk out of the ocean. We don’t belong in that sh**.

Guys this has proven fake

I thought it was real. F...

There&#39;s is fake guys

Women: you are my Hero!Man: jumps off the cliff...Shark: i wonder what that thingam be?HER,0: Underwater shitting ensues.

A minute of silence for those who think this is real 🤦🏻‍♂️

Ur lucky I&#39;m not hungry..................🦈

it is real??

why is no one talking about the fact that this is manly jump rock not the harbour tf. lies and false information

When your excitement of making a you tube vid takes a sudden turn.

He want to say just hello😒

Last words “holy shit”😂😂😂😂

The level of adrenaline was high...

What the fuck did he expect? The only safe body of water in all of Australia is a swimming pool, and even then you have to keep your backyard completely sheltered.

☠

So badly fake it’s not so obvious - pretty sure freeway whites wouldn’t be up in that close either - if it was a bull shark more believable fake

I already jumped in this rock. Fuck!!

When you don&#39;t really deserve a second chance, but you get one anyway.  Lucky guy!

is it just me....or does this video look kinda fake

I love how the universal language of seeing something shitpant worthy is AAAAAAH

Fake

HoLy sHiT

This video is fake

Welcome to Australia
cRazy
shark: ooo look a human! don&#39;t mind if i just... nvm i smell fishhuman: i&#39;m about to get eaten alive nvm he swam away

Uploader : Man fights pff a sharkDiver : bubbles up for his lifeMeanwhile The shark : what the f*** you doin man

what shark no attack

Badass Great White Shark
Is that in manly?

Man: AHHHH!!!!! 😨Shark: interesting interesting 🤔
When you&#39;re in the &quot;being the fiercest animal&quot; competition and your opponent is Australian man

Fake

That was looking like a directed scene from a movie, game or a book

I bet he won’t jump off there again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS IS FAKE STOP ACTING LIKE ITS REAL

WTF this could cost your life ! idiot . you are risking your entire life

I get sweaty armpits and agita every time I watch these scary shark videos.

Shark was like, yo dude! Chillax 😂

Last time I’d be doing that

Fact: Bears eat great white sharks.

I must have missed the part where he fought the shark off

Wheres the fight ?🤔

this is fake

I don&#39;t know. Theres someone really funny about how his friend yelled &quot;shark&quot; and dude starts swimming towards it LOL

No damn way will I ever get in the ocean

He didn&#39;t fight anything. This was disappointing

He’s never going back there again 😅😂😂😂😅

Wow man that&#39;s some great cgi..Good job.

I wanna pet it.

The seagull flying away should’ve hinted that a shark is near

it got 2 chances to bite. if u swim wildly it will bite because u look like a seal swimming like that. if one is near then calm down and slowly swim away.

Fake!

My thalasaphobia right now📈📈

<a href="">0:59</a>

How come I could point out the shark <a href="">0:12</a> into the video through a shit camera.....but a group of people there in person can&#39;t see it and are dumb enough to jump in?Btw, this man didn&#39;t &quot;fight off a shark&quot;.........if that shark wanted to eat him he would be missing his legs or dead....it was curious at most and the guy never touched the shark.......but people will say anything to get those clicks.....

That doesn’t look like a great white I think that’s a fully grown black tip reef shark

That shark just wasn’t hungry. I would poo myself for sure. 😮🤭💀

Fake.

Real

The shark: &quot;uhm excuse me what the actual f are you doing in my house&quot;

holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
My heart was in my mouth

THE GREAT WHITE NOPE

Cameraman never dies
Idiot!

Fake as fuck 😂

I hope that will teach him a valuable lesson to take a boat not just swim

First and last jump.  Soiled trunks like squid water.

It was really bad when the blood came out.
DAMNNNNN MAN this is TERRIFYING!!!

is more edited than wikipedia
thats what I would do....drop underneath when its close...swim away...repeat...if I had a knife, would stab it as it comes...but this shark was very calm....when sharks dart at you...yeah good luck...probably a dead man

This video is completely fake

The shark couldnt care less about suxh a coward

lol nobody&#39;s seems realising this is fake...

Shit myself watching this

Wanted a thrill.Got one.

That was CRAZY. My heart was racing!!!

He lying he didn’t fight it just swam near it poor shark looked terrorafied well he didnt hurt it alls well that ends well 😊

Friendly guy! He’s just curious  what everyone was screaming about

Bro the shark wasnt even attacking bro this guy scared for nothing

“Man fights off shark”?  I think they meant “shark evacuates area after swimmer shits his pants”

There was no fighting going on there, but if this is real then still wow. Shark seemed pretty chill haha

Fake

This is an old dis proved  fake video

This is fake.

Why does nobody noticed that this is the same footage from the man on the paddleboard that falls in the water and sees the great white look it up it’s the same exact footage the shark underwater they Gail. Everything one of them is fake and honestly that’s just not cool if I encountered a sword and somebody took the footage and acted like it was their own I would be pissed because that’s scary enough of an experience especially for somebody to take the credit. I don’t know which one is the correct one but it’s the same damn footage.

Oh my god, this video absolutely terrified me. Fairly sure i twisted my panties watching this LOL 😭🙈

If you&#39;re swimming off the coast of Australia, you deserve to get attacked by a Great White. 🤦

Very unproffesional shaky camera holding, ruined such a great opportunity to do it properly and do some great footage. :)

Awww, scary, you never know what will await you in the ocean, creepy like in the movie!
Damn is he lucky.

Nearly dead ..so lucky

<a href="">0:38</a> &quot;the words of fear under water&quot; 😂

I know the feeling. I once fell into my koi pond and the key is to remain calm.

I miss when this looked real to me.

The dude calling out to him is a hero

you officially can&#39;t buy another lottery ticket for the rest of your life.......your luck is officially used up

Australia is hell on earth 😂😂😂 snakes, spiders, sharks, crocodiles you name it it’s there hahaha

Fake and guy.

Man shits his pants in Sydney harbor

Pretty sure this video has been proven fake

Fake

I would have shit a brick if I saw that. That’s why I don’t swim in the ocean. Hell no but this video can’t be real. Great whites like the deep ocean and I don’t think the water is deep enough here

It's scary no matter how many times I see it
Fake as shit.

Dude didn’t fight off shit! That shark just decided not to eat him

To bad this is fake af

GoPro: &quot;Man Fights Off Great White Shark...&quot;Shark: &quot;Bruh. I didn&#39;t even start swinging.&quot;

I’ve had sex with 100’s of great white sharks. They’re very generous lovers.

Fake

100% FAKE.  UNFORTUNATELY.

The holy shit!! Was the best part of the video😂

more like man runs, from shark... thumbs down

Jesus, im good without the Ocean

When did you fight it off? I must&#39;ve missed that part

Liked the part where he fought the shark…

good fake ;)

That shark wasn’t attacking 😂 you would’ve been eaten if it was

Nice editing
This is edited, not real.

The amount of idiocracy in the comments 

No, it&#39;s not the correct course of actions taken, he&#39;s in a fucking panic, which anybody expect for a few very experience shark swimmers would be in a situation were they go from: <b>Look at my jump</b> <b>Big fucking shark</b>I understand thing are a lot less scary when you&#39;re watching it on a screen, maybe even a very small screen, but this shark is several times bigger than him.

Shark was like yak what the shit is this?

I would have distracted the shark with some chum, fresh chum!

That bwhlbbwhlb sound is fight? Ok.

shark is just che king up on you seeing if your struggling lol

faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake

This guy never again jump to water in forbiden area. Hard lesson of rules.

Fake

Not as scary as Jaws

Bro the shark was like ok you didn’t have to be rude about it

That acts as a prey.
Australia is legit just humanity on legendary

I heard that this was more faked nonsense

he didnt &quot;fight off&quot; that shark, he kicked and cried like little baby and crawled out of the water

The most famous fake video of all times. It deserves an Academy Award.

Australia is God&#39;s beta test of predatory apex animals like a trial run  to work out any kinks before he unleashes that update patch on the rest of the world lol that country you can&#39;t even  flush the toilet literally without having faced 10 kinds of death experiences and close call not even counting the insects and poisoning lol...the only thing colonial British empire got correct why waste ammo on a firing squad when you claim to own Australia and tend to use it as a bus stop lol that&#39;s 200% death sentence lol

Who fights? 😂

And that’s why ya don’t do anything in Australia.

That´s fighting vs a white shark? JJjjjjjjj,

Much better than Jaws!

As be sad before if you watch at 12 sec and 22 and 23 sec and more difficult to be sure views before the jump. This was really there. If it,s fake there is a huge producten proces with high quality for detail gowing in it. + i believe there just to be a Shark net in the harbour. Because of the many problems before in the 50 and 60 of the past century. So its for me 95% real, and very good posible

what a chicken

Not bad at all, especially the waving of arms and legs in the same frame as the shark. Unfortunately, performing said actions whilst screaming underwater won’t deter a rl curious Great White, in the slightest, from investigating ( i.e. biting) the skinny little thing splashing around in it’s hunting grounds.

This clip isn’t real but about a year ago a man did jump off a cliff in Sydney Harbour and accidentally land on top of a great white. The shark ripped him in half and he died

So fake. Badly edited

Great video is terrify !! Grettings from OMAHA WARGAMES.

Man switches to freestyle swimming with a great white in the water with him. If your gonna jump in waters with sharks, you should be aware of what triggers their predatory instincts. This dude got lucky that shark wasn’t hungry with all the splashing he did

fake vid it was clearly a dolphin

Fake as

Is that a Snickers floating in the sea after you got out

Love the bloop

So he quickly found out why they constructed a metal fence there lol

It looks pretty fake

Keep splashing stupid. aussies dumb AF when it comes to nature.

C&#39;mon mate, that was a bit dramatic wasn&#39;t it? Shark wasn&#39;t even after you. Dramatic title of vid. Lol. Wanker

Didn&#39;t fight it off.. You&#39;re lucky that big boy wasn&#39;t hungry! 😂

Fights off? Looks more like &quot;flees from&quot;.

This is so old..................and FAKE.That people still fall for this is beyond me.

Why is that water so brown?

great editing
Obviously fake, at <a href="">1:07</a> the swims to the left until its gone but when he looks out of the water the cliff is there

I would have died seeing that thing in the same place as me lol
What a moron, risking your life twice, jumping from a cliff and being eaten by a shark. So immature and irresponsible!

Man, better acting and they would have had me fooled.

The last thing you should do when you see a shark in the water is splash around. Glad he got out of there alive, but the reason the shark was attracted to him in the first place was the splashing.

Bro swim in a swimming pool ffs

Video is FAKE. Google it

Fake s fuck!
Holy shit. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d need to shit for a week after that. I woulda evacuated everything outta my bowels as soon as I saw that big fucker 10 feet in front of me!!! 😎🤣😆😀

Oooof, those underwater screams send shivers.

I don&#39;t know Rick, looks fake 😔

🦈 Nah.. I&#39;m full. Lucky bastard 🤣🤣🤣
Fake😂

Yeah I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is fake!

Did someone open up a bag of Killer Whale piss with Killer Whale lotion😝😉🙃

That shark was just as confused as him.

Tip: don&#39;t splash 😂 it&#39;ll just attract sharks

Editing... That&#39;s it!

The guy didn&#39;t even fight the shark all he did was scream underwater, and the shark didn&#39;t even try to fight him he just looked curious.

Wait, so is this real or not? I can’t really tell myself. 🦈

&quot;Man fights off shark&quot;The shark: im just chilling

This scene was rehearsed many times.  The shark is a way better actor.🏆

What video game is this

the shark was just existing lol

Is that real?

Wtf else did he expect? A herring? 😅

😂😂😂😂PENDEJO!!!😂😂

It&#39;s fake.  Don&#39;t you realise how rare great white sharks are?

That&#39;s just Bruce. He&#39;s in recovery. P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney

This guy made every possible attempt to make the situation worst. He jumping into such murky waster is asking for trouble. Then when he sees the shark he starts to splatter and make as much vibration in the water attracting the shark even more. Im suprise he made it unharm.

Well this a very great Edit, since they’re saying this is fake

if its all the same to you, ima just not get in the ocean. ever. for any reason.

somewhere in multiverse the shark&#39;s buddy is screaming aussie! aussie! behind you!

The moment he screams underwater and there are no bubbles visible rising in front of the camera, I knew it&#39;s fake.

Being that I live in Southern California...I really have so much respect for all Aussies for ever going into the ocean there beyond knee-deep water. FATN --&gt; Fuk All That Noise!!!

There should be a world wide culling of Tigers, Whites, Bulls, Makos, and black tips. Money for fins.

Everything, every critter on land or in the sea or in lakes can and will kill you. Then there’s their government threatening everyone with unemployment or jail if you don’t comply with their “mandates”. Or, am I thinking of the U.S.?No it’s both!!!

The human race are really the most stupid animal on earth 🌎

So fake.

Swim calmly back to shore, splashing like that makes the shark excited

It didn&#39;t show any intention to attack

Fake sharks live in salt water that’s a lake or pond

I can believe that if u keep eye contact with the shark your chances of survival r a great deal higher as is the case here !

Flailing around like this a real shark would have taken a chomo for sure

YOU GAS NICE UNDER WATER, THE SHARK IS BAD

BECOME.🤣😂😅
&quot;Dude, sick jump&quot;<b>underwater flailing and screaming</b>&quot;Was it something I said?&quot;

😮😮😮😮. A great white shark.
Don’t Ever do It Again

Not too sure this is real, lools very well done but there seems to be moments the shark swims right where the wall should be. It all looks staged to me 🤷‍♂️

Wow when i first saw thos video years ago i thought it was fake. This is terrifying. Could never be me.

That’s how he never went there again

Dammmm he got lucky as fuck man

consider my pants, shat.

That&#39;s an understatement!!You owe your life to your lookout.

Dumbass.

Fake

If that shark was hungry ....

Natural selection. Fucking piece
Oh that shark wasn&#39;t going to bother him if it was he wouldn&#39;t have seen it until it was too late... they are ambush predators

But .... to shit on a shark&#39;s nose?😂

No Swimming 🐊
People like this who put fake sht online, are criminal scammers nothing more nothing less It is proven that this video is edited By trash people

completely fake.

Who made this video, CNN?

So he did everything wrong with a shark encounter but fought it off?? The amount of frantic splashing would’ve irritated me too. That was a very small and chill white.

Most likely not a real video.  Its fake. If you notice it&#39;s two different videos. Nice try looks real.

He got his adrenaline shot up for sure

And thats how the Australian people never becomes old 😊

Nobody watching seems to notice there are waves/chop on the surface from the underwater clips. And the acting was really bad. 😄

Ok, if you don't encounter a poisonous spider, it's a toad, a snake, sharks, crocodiles or kangaroos that kick you. You have to have thick skin to live there.
That’s when he knew! He fucked up!!!!!

That was too close. He was almost shark food.

Eehhh sharks very rarely attack humans monstly surfers because they think they are seas and they only eat humans if there desperate because apparently to animals especially sea creatures we taste disgusting it swam near because it was curious what was going on and feeling all the vibrations form you panicking

That shark wasn&#39;t attacking at anytime we saw on camera.

The best way to avoid shark attacks is to stay out of the ocean, but if that&#39;s not an option, avoiding steep drop offs at the shoreline also helps. Like, exactly what&#39;s in this video, that&#39;s where you don&#39;t want to enter the ocean. That is, unless you&#39;re trying to capture Go-Pro footage of yourself nearly getting eaten by a Great White, then, that is where you should enter the ocean.

And this folks is Exactly why you don’t jump off of cliffs into unknown waters 😳🦈

In australia even when taking a shower you must be ready for a close shark encounter, waters there are extremely shark infested But this guy&#39;s also extremely lucky, he was under the merci of a shark that had absolutely no desire, no will and not intention to attack him and that is the only reason he survivedat many points in the footage, the shark got extremlely close to the guy, a couple of feet away sometimes and he didn&#39;t attack himNobody can explain why he didn&#39;t attack him, this footage is also in contradiction with all those theories brought to us by scientists where they tell us that if you ever encounter sharks don&#39;t start to nervously splash water because this will trigger them and keep calm while slowly backing away (much easy said than done), but this just shows that all these are absolute lies and BS and this videos confirms it and shows that sharks when they attack they don&#39;t care about being triggered or not, they attack humans and they do it because they want to do itso when you encounter a shark and he didn&#39;t attack you, that&#39;s only because he didn&#39;t want to attack yousome people still think that shark can mistake humans for seals or that sharks are friendly to humans ... if you still think this, you are absolutely delusional

What a situation!! Looking again at the shark was the best choice 👌

Isn&#39;t this that fake video??  Yea,,it is. That dude took forever to swim back to the rocks .  Great editing job though

Fake

Yes the clip of fake but it so real looking and very proud on the camera work and cgi if it is cgi tho crazy feels real g

Shark:oh whats this thing oh a human. Useless im just gonna leave it there

Hey buddy, how are you? Advise the next time we decided to jump into the ocean make sure the place is not infested with sharks already but you live in Australia, so how the fuck are you going to know where those assholes are gonna pop up so you’re lucky to be alive pal

Fake as fuck

That scared the shit outta me and I’m looking at it on an iPad

Have these people no brains? But is it fake video?

Once you are in water that&#39;s marine life world...don&#39;t even think fighting back

Fake Fake Fake.  I love how the people are all mischievously grinning before he jumps.   Why all the smiles if he&#39;s simply jumping int the water? As soon as he hits the water, the guy on the cliff is point and saying &quot;Shark&quot; like something straight out of a Jaws movies  That water is so black you can&#39;t see squat when he&#39;s standing on the cliff, but somehow the other guy saw it.

The Shark was like&quot; bro the guy I ate last week did a much better jump&quot;😂

Oh FUCK... FUCKING FUCK NO MAN!! lucky for you , for whatever reason that shark wasn&#39;t interested in you..... you&#39;re so lucky  he didn&#39;t take a bite just out of curiosity... you&#39;re one lucky bloke mate!!! Now go buy a lottery ticket😅

If that man didnt look under water and look at the shark, the shark would of attacked him while he was swimming away from it,it would of thought it was pray. They say best way to survive a shark attack is got to make eye contact with it. Sharks are opportunists when your not looking. 😂 💯🦈

I think this ares prohibited for swimming but there is no sign for that. They most put sign to educate people 😢

This is fake..

Great whites have no interest in humans. If there is a shark attack its usally them getting confused between humans and seals because the sharks natural food is seals but some of you guys said he should of made eye contact with the shark and you guys are right

Shark after realizing it was an Australian: ah hell NO!!

Nahhh .... just stay down there dumbass. Humans are ignorant.  I don&#39;t feel sorry for anyone attacked by a shark. Everyone knows there are sharks in the ocean. Stop acting surprised when you jump in the water and one is right next to you.

Camera man never dies
Oops... loooooool

Years later and debunked but people still think this is real 😂

Great Whites are pretty common in South Australia. This one kept swimming away though.

Crazy because he literally does everything you are not supposed to do and managed to not get eaten despite breaking every single rule.  You&#39;re supposed to remain calm or at least appear calm and you shouldn&#39;t flail or the predator will think you are prey in distress or injured and thus meant to be a meal.

I could be very wrong as I know next to nothing about sharks, but it doesn&#39;t look like a typical great white looks more like a black tip reef sharrk

Didn&#39;t see the shark attack him just keep checking him out cause he was splashing like crazy trying to swim

💥 Yet still wondering if the shark was going to chase him up the stairs

Were very very lucky,flapping around like that in water wow mate so dam lucky mate!!! I no I&#39;d of been same flapping about total natural reaction 😂but so lucky buddy

Holy shit thanks for the the addrennaln rush / clinch / flex and as a bonus we matched words once you got to rocks &quot;holy shit&quot; .... P.s. I take deep breath now l. Fuuggggg!! That was a big fish hahaha.

Shark: oh its the camera man 📷 man: 😱 🏊‍♂️Shark: make sure u get my good side 📷 man: 😱😱😱🏊‍♂️ 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♂️
This was a fake

Fake. And also the name of the video is misleading. He doesnt fight off anything

Fake

struggling and screaming was the worst route bro could&#39;ve took

Still one of the most anxiety inducing films ever. Good job.

U gonna do it again?

Fake or not, I know when you encounter a shark you&#39;re supposed to &quot;stay calm&quot; and splash as little as possible. I understand the science behind it, it&#39;s very logical. But still if I look to my side and see a great white idk how tf I would simply stay calm

Fake😂

Holy s*** is right!!

This is why I&#39;ll never live in AUS

Lucky for him,  the shark seems tummy-full and not hungry. Or else,  he would have been shark snack. 😆

Holly Shit Indeed

If it was real he wouldnt have made it out alive.

What a karnt

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

In sheer panic mode, I would’ve climbed out of that water as fast as I could, frantically run up those stairs, jump in my car, drive to the nearest church like a bat outta’ hell, and confess all my sins….even if I’m not catholic.

The guy should not have been flailing his arms. Maintain eye contact and swim towards it. As it comes to you grab it gently by the nose and redirect him.

That was scary but the headline made it seem like he was literally face to face with the shark and it was a bit of a distance away from him. He did the worse possible thing by flailing all over the place like a freaking seal. Hes lucky he didnt get bit. He shouldnt be in the water if he panics like that.

That&#39;s a pretty deep river. He&#39;s like a foot away from land and there&#39;s no sea floor in sight

Maybe that&#39;s why there were barriers, and maybe he shouldn&#39;t have gone around them.

He&#39;s lucky that shark wasn&#39;t hungry... 💀

I would never swim in Australia ocean!

Just a baby one

What a fool

Only dumb people are doing the dumb thing...

So he got to experience the ultimate adrenaline rush

Those fences might have been an indication of not to jump off the cliffs. You know, rules and such.

Another reason I won&#39;t go there!!!

Australia is where humans go to die

He faced the shark head on. That saved his life

Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
fake

I would’ve changed the color of that water to pee yellow

&quot;From now on we will be making our videos on dirt bikes.....far away from water...also i need my spare pants...for reasons&quot;

He&#39;s so lucky that the great white didn&#39;t lunge at him as if he was a seal.

This is defo fake how did he see underwater so clearly without goggles to notice the shark and be so terrified?

The shark was probably like: &quot;woah! you ok there man?! you just fell straight through the roof into my house just there!&quot;

legit proof that cameraman never dies

So did something really stupid, which could have costed you everything and than following it up with an excited social media moment? I sense a process of natural selection running it’s course.

So cute

And when did he fight???

Nice, but fake....

He did not fight it of he just swam away from it.

Stop kicking around dummy. Just glide through the water.

Australia!On land: Kangaroos to rupture your spleen and ticks that give you meat allergies, snakes and spiders that can kill you within minutes. In water: salty crocodiles to pull you in and devour you on your fishing trip, tiny jellyfish that kill you and finally probably the most formidable predator on earth besides the polar bear waiting for you just offshore. I’m never stepping foot in Australia no thanks.

The shark is just looking, nothing more.

This tool is in an area he shouldn&#39;t have been in anyway.

Looks fake

I got told this is fake

For a second i thought it was real. Im like how can someone that lives in Australia be that dumb to randomly jump in the ocean. But yeah there are people that dumb

Fake

Bro called running away “fighting off”💀

more false than the courage of that posh face

Yea um no not in Australia i will go swimming with a Animal that considers me food.

Don&#39;t splash so much water just face it and swim slowly. Since, they like chasing down a predator and take pleasure in killing them.

Technically the go pro made him a cameraman and you know the cameraman never dies.

Imagine chilling, cliff diving, jumping into the water just to find yourself facing a fuckn huge great white shark.

Jesus fuckn Christ and hell

Dude Didn’t fight off shit! He was panicking the whole time and got lucky.

Is this fake?

Nice cgi..

More like man turns water brown around great white

Fake as if he’s not seen it before he jumped off the massive cliff when there’s a bloke in a boat

Him splashing around like that, the shark would’ve dusted him almost straight away. Before even that, his jump into the water more than likely would’ve scared the shark away. Fake and gay

He has a nice belly buton

Him: panics and flails around in the waterShark: chilling outAlso shark: Isn&#39;t that exactly what they tell you guys not to do when you see me?

I heard screaming and splashing is the best thing to do when there is a man eating shark in the water with you.

is this footage real??

Fake

F for Fake

genuinely concerned that a lot of the people in the comments think this was a real shark… first of all it seems like they’re in a lake, now let that sink in.

Sick mate
The shark was more curious as to what the fuck you were

Superfake

When did the shark 🦈 jump off the cliff ?!

Holy shit indeed!!!

Nice fake dude, wonder why so many ppl r so stupid 😂 tjey ignore to realize

it’s a fake video

You can see something in the water at <a href="">00:10</a>

I’d probably be allergic to seawater after this meeting.

Could tell it was fake instantly

Fake

He didn’t fight off anything 😂 more like release brown particles

IS this the Real and original footage ? Lots of vidéos have the same

Fake or not, it would be more aptly titled “man panics and shits his pants after jumping like  a dumbass into the harbor”

Great production video.

This video is more fake than her love

Anyone else see the shark before he jumped I swear you briefly see a fin go by

it&#39;s fake right?

Nope

This is easily the worst thing you could do when confronted with a shark. Everything he’s doing is signaling to the shark “wounded prey.”

More like man panicked after seeing a shark. It was curious, not hungry ... Lucky man !

Shark saw aussie in distress and came to help....Aussie in meantime acting over dramatic !

Sharky looked more curious than anything If that shark wanted you dead he woulda leaped out and yeeted you back in the water

Fuck this….

I didn&#39;t see any fighting. I saw the shark circle in curiosity which is what they do. Realized it wasn&#39;t what it wanted swim away. I also saw a chicken shit human being, Who jumped into that sharks home.

I would not have felt sorry for the guy if he would have got eaten. Or even bitten. You broke into their house, Just like somebody who would break into our house. We just like sharks will do what we have to do to defend our house. Personally I think the guy is an idiot.

Fake

Where was the fight? Lame

This may be fake, but the amount of crocs there is crazy… they say you can’t go too the beach at night because there are so many crocs that you could sit on one and think it’s a log

That shark ate already

If this is fake, it&#39;s still the best fake I&#39;ve seen to this day 9 years later.

Impresionante <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
😂😂😂😂 So Fake
Sharks usually don’t attack unless threatened or they are curious then they use their mouths to feel if they can’t identify the object they see.

He did not fight off the shark if the shark wanted he would be lunch

He got lucky

In one part of the video there appear to be 2 sharks
He did not fight off the shark at all. The shark was just curious

Would have pissed my pants and froze

It’s fake. Look at :59 seconds. You can see two silhouettes.

Scary 😧 so scary 😟

Did you hear the &#39;squeaky bum time&#39; at the end.😅

That was barely a shark.  C&#39;mon man.  My last girlfriend was WAY bigger, and I&#39;ve had to fight her off plenty of times.

In my country this situation is called &quot;Cagaço&quot;.

So fake and incredibly dangerous to make a video like this. People looking for info on what to do to survive a shark attack would be completely misguided. Splashing is the worst thing you can do it would think you’re prey and come to you. Absolute clown looking for views.

I’d find the worst part to be just as you’re getting out thinking it’s gonna bite your legs off. He’s lucky. They can sense fear

Want to get attacked keep splashing around

Not much of a fight /:- \Not that my money was on the man in a real struggle with a great white. But this was a simple scare and run. He didn&#39;t even have to touch the shark.

He doesn’t look like he will never do that again lol.

A well known fake footage

Very lucky and stupid guy. When you see a shark. You DO not panic and splash. When it approaches your keep your eye on it. And touch the top of its head to push it away.

Holy shit... now that was an understatement

Fake

Holy shit indeed

100% Fake.

Fake

See as you splash in the water it follows you because it thinks you’re either injured prey or trying to run away from it. As soon as he turned around it changed its direction. You do not turn your back to shark, instead, you face it and go forward. That’s what I learned from all these reels 😄

the shark was probably just curious

Holy shide, said the aussie guy

Don’t live to die, bad trade

Holy shit 🤣
You should work on your camera holding technique during those moments.

There should be a way to flag fake videos posing as real so you can filter them out.

I like how the shark just looked confused

Was this real? Like this actually happened?

Australians are just built different lol

Its super easy to avoid this situation. NEVER. GO IN. THE OCEAN. Just swim in a pool or a lake. No sharks. Tho some polls will have gators.

Yeah, this looks so fake. I mean, it looks the shark is in on it. Fake prank!

This is by far the scariest shark video I&#39;ve ever seen. I back up too everytime I watch it lol

Tiny one. You were lucky. Btw you were aware there were sharks in Australia waters, no?

that shark couldn&#39;t see him and looked calm cos it was edited into his footage 😂

FAKE!!!

THERE&#39;S A SHARK!<b>swims towards the shark</b>

I don&#39;t see that I fight with him

What fight ? The shark is not interested in you at all

Already debunked...Fake video. The shark is clipping multiple time.

Photoshop asf 😂

Shark: Oh, hey, what’s up?Guy: <b>glgbsinsbjbe</b>Shark: Oh, okay, have a good day.

good editing but bad acting

How exactly did you fight it off?🤔

Lol didn’t fight him off shark wanted nothing to do with him, if he did this dude was toast

Geez, do they not have “Stand Your Ground” laws in Australia? The shark was like, “This btch was acting crazy in my backyard, yo.”

Hoax

Moral of the story, don’t go into shark infested waters😊

One of the biggest baits of all time

more like man panics and scrambles off the water after diving without recognizing there&#39;s a shark in there

Yeah…right.
I&#39;m not meaning this in a &#39;you&#39;re a scaredy cat way&#39;, but sharks tend to be quite docile creatures. Good job for not panicking too much and getting out safely!

Stupid . Left the poor shark hungry

He would die If splashed the water this way in a real encounter

I&#39;ve jumped off that wall. Place is called Manly.

A real Aussie would have gone for another jump off the cliff

Ever notice this sort of things all happen in a white populated areas of the world. LMAO that&#39;s what you get for not poaching. In bed with predators waiting to eat you. I&#39;ve been swimming in beaches all my life, most of the times I swam as far as I could from the shallow water. I have never encounter any human killing animals in my life.

9 years later or not, I would still be traumatised

Dude I’m so glad your ok
Apart from the shark it was a fairly uneventful swim.

He was just investigating but it would still scare the hell out of me.

I haven&#39;t seen any fighting. The shark was just not hungry. Lucky guy. :)

😂😂😂😂😂😂

Regular trip to work in Australia

43 Million views well done editors.

From the comments it seems only a couple people realized shark was edited, crazy... With audience like that AI will surely turn the world into ashes

fake

The pup didn&#39;t even try to attack.Lmfao&quot;Fights off a great white,&quot; my ass.

what an idiot
Next time im in a potentially dangerous situation im just going to pull out my phone and start filming it. 99.9% chance of survival.

Never thought about that jumping off small cliffs into water patroled by sharks is a very bad idea.

it&#39;a fake propaganda of Gopro

imagine believing this video is real

Definitely didn&#39;t &quot;fight off&quot; any shark. But that was scary

Huge.   Face-to-face!   Holy Shyt, indeed!

Yes. This video is true. I was the shark.

Shark: HEY IM WALKING HERE!!!!

Idiots and liars are the rule. Not the exception

At 58 seconds the shark pulls a teleport maneuver to the left of your screen. That&#39;s a supernatural 🦈.  I always knew they existed but noone would believe me till now. Im just happy the 🦈 , I meant truth,  finally came to the surface.

This has been repeatedly outed as an edit. FAKE.

I am of the opinion that people who go in water are dumb.

Splashing like a dumbass

YT: Brave man fights off shark!Reality: Sportsmanlike shark practices catch and release.

😂😂😂😂😂😂

You can see the shark was terrified. Imagine a crazy Aussie going full Kamikaze falling from the sky to pull a sneak attack on an innocent great white. Sharky Boy is probably scarred for life. 👺👺

I wouldn’t call that “fighting off”

His smelly feet kept the shark away

Fake as

Fight is a big word describing what happened

Lucky)
Nightmare

It's a terrible fight, the man punches him at least 50 times.
I would have been able to scare the shark away easy because i would have pooped so much it would have turn the ocean brown

Never thrash and try swimming away from them when they’re coming towards you, supposed to face them and touch their head and follow down their back

haha so fake xD

yeah you're completely fucked man
Ohh, what a lucky man he was!  😮

Farcry be like:

Warning shark attack eat you die. Don&#39;t place dangerous.

wluldnt call thya a fight but scary as hell.. shark would killed his ass

Now he will never know that his car warranty is up this July .

The new Far Cry looking hella realistic bro.

This looks really fake

Idk if it&#39;s your first time editing this kind of thing, but it was very convincing for a minute. I think the movement is what gives it away, something very uncanny valley about it that I just can&#39;t quite put my finger on.

This isn&#39;t real. If this was really in Australia, the guy would have grabbed onto its fin and rode it like a mechanical bull 😎🤙.

Lol I remember this video and finding out it was fake. Several news orgs tried to interview them and they refused. Great production quality though!

Fake

CLEVERLY EDITED SHARK FOOTAGE! EVERYONE OUT THE WATER....

That&#39;s what you get for trespassing

Ok, so maybe there WAS a reason for that fence.

Wow, this is crazy scary

Lucky you. You born again. Please, don&#39;t tempt fortune and don&#39;t defy nature never more...Shark should have eaten there...

He’s lucky he looks like avatar . On the otherhand Shark was scared shitless

FAKE!!! 🤡
He didn&#39;t fight the shark off, if the shark wanted him as a meal he would be done.

Good thing he turned and faced it, had he tried to just swim for it, he may have gotten hit

I don&#39;t know Rick...

GoPro: Shark Fights Off Great White Man In Sydney Harbour

Guy: <b>screaming underwater</b>Shark: Boooogaboogabooga!!!
That actually looked pretty real. But it’s not… Common

Fake video

Fekin hell, Im glad Im living in Ireland 😅

This is my nightmare

That was probably the shittiest reaction possible when meeting a shark 😂 act like prey and you may become it.

never anymore him escapes of a shark that way 😂

For a damn reason those bars are there, but these idiots don&#39;t understand!....

I mean … he just got in … wow that’s anxiety for you !! On a 2nd note here… his life was probably saved by the other guy yelling shark !! Good job  there 👏 you were splashing a lot though, I’m not sure if that can be avoided but I hear it grabs sharks attention even more … oh this was 9 years ago 😂

fake

Legend has it, he’s still swimming to the edge

Dude doesn’t fight off shit. The “shark” is clearly in a bulking phase, because it looks at him and realizes swallowing this frail, sackless dude would put him in a caloric deficit. He needs at least 130lbs per meal.

Click bait. There was no fight

Your reaction was very dumb and you are lucky he didn’t attack you because of your dumb reaction

That was obviously fake… technology now days

Bro I know that has to change you as a person man that is crazy

Australia the land where all the animals can kill you.

Absolutely terrifying and one of my biggest fears

59 second timeShark teletrasporto 😂

Fake as 10!

TENSE!!SHOCKING!!TERRIFYING!!FAKE!!

Thank the Lord that man was alright.

Ya it was all planned faker than the government’s If that was a great white shark it would of attacked with a massive bite

little did he know the scary part began after the jump.

Great White Shark

He Ain’t Fight Off Shit 🤣😂
Precisely why I don’t go in the ocean.

I wonder where that grin and that hi-5 went. 😂

yeah lets call this “fight”

You can clearly see the shark before going in 🙄

Is there any reward for videos like this?
Why am I more stressed out behind a screen

Fake

Fakeroni

Fake morons

Looks fake, the shark footage looks super imposed from previous footage.

Fake! look at the surface under water and out water... 😆

His Mom always knew he would end up a F-ing idiot

GoshSo glad he made it out alive uninjured

Poor..SHARK!!!! WT OUT HER DINNER😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭!! MUST CALL FOR GREANPEASE!!!!!
Scared to the point of peeing
fake

Another reason to avoid this god forsaken country.

photoshop

The only thing he fought off was the $hit in in his trunks

This is a fake as trump

This is Australia. We know better than to jump off into the harbour.

This is so clearly edited… baffling

It’s fake!

It&#39;s well done, but it&#39;s a fake.

Damn! Scary stuff

One of the best Fakes i have eher Seen

happy birtsday

This is so easy to fake. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was. Every time the camera turns completely black when it dives in or out the water, you can transition to any other video you want.

Damn... as soon as it started to play, I recognized this fake video, but the click has already been done, and so... one more click added.

nice video, not too real

You have got some balls, well done ❤

“Fights off” = panicking and thrashing around whilst the shark causally swims around looking curious and confused.

Fake Fake Fake Fake F U

Better come to Greece to swim, in Greece all sharks on holiday🤣🤣🤣

I know that was terrifying to come across but guys try I know it’s hard but just try to never panic and splash, the more you splash the more you will attract the shark because that’s when the shark will see you as prey we humans are not their natural food chain if it’s coming towards you face it and gently put your hand on  the nose and redirect it

And he left...😅
Fight.....I didn't eat it because I didn't want to
Man that was anxiety inducing!

I think he was lucky when he went under the water, because the shark just came and left. It shoud be safer than floating on the surface.

😂😂😂

Bro didn&#39;t even care if the barnacles cut him up

FAKE

There cant be on earth that much stupid people who actually think this is real wtf

Why do people think this is real?

Oh shit!!!

Struggle? Nothing about fighting xd
That sound he made when the shark approach him &quot;piu piu piu piu&quot; 😂

What were you yelling at the shark?? It sounded like  ÿammy, yammy, yammy  😦

And they say you have to swim smoothly. And he clapped his hands on the water like a victim, he fought
OMG😭😭
See a &quot;shaaak&quot; then splash around and yell underwater, it&#39;s what all experienced swimmers do once they plop in next to a great white merely wanting to offer constructive criticism on a cliff jump.

“Swim Charlie! Swim!! Don’t look back Charlie!!!”
STUPIDITY WHO WANTS TO DIE THAT WAY U IDIOT TRY IT AGAIN U GOT LUCKY THATS ALL

He didn’t “fights off” anything. Sharks normally don’t attack humans.

Better than any scene from JAWS

fucking hell....

It’s FAKE.

I know humans are limited on what we can do...BUT, at a time like that....I have NO DOUBT, that i could pull a Scooby-Doo and jump up out of the water and run across to land!

That split second between above and under is ill 🤧 🤦‍♂️
This is one of those &quot;out of the body&quot; experiences.

Why do people put themselves in situations like this? This guy is lucky as s**t.

Fight OFF ??? hahaha

- Point is Australia is nice to tourists, but it&#39;s tough on its own people. Congratulations, mate. You&#39;re one of us.- Are you saying what I think you&#39;re saying?  I&#39;m crocodile Dunphy?-That&#39;s not what I was saying at all.

F A K E

43M views for a fake video... that&#39;s crazy

😂😂😂

fake

what a dangerous beastly creature. i felt like he was ready to attack anyone. the shark was cool too i guess.

He was just looking around, he wasn’t gonna bite you if u weren’t being a spaz

holy shiff

I'm sorry to inform you, but the video is fake
I&#39;ve been watching a video about how to avoid shark attack by tapping firmly on their head , and your video came up next.

Trudeau determined the submersible imploded because it was not flying the mandatory rainbow flag during pride month.

He could&#39;ve been a meal of that Australian.

the shark just didn&#39;t feel like snackin&#39;

shallowfake

Just rotate it lol

Shark in that moment : &quot; Holy shit, HUMAN ! &quot;

Video is fake. Cant believe how many people is buying this. No wonder we are doomed. We can be fooled at any time.

Wasn&#39;t much of a fight! Shark: Hmm, what&#39;s this jackass yelling about?

Seems fake

This is the most hardcore guy I've ever seen in my life 😳😬
Lol the video is fake i&#39;m pretty sure i saw that somewhere but still cool none the less

Fought off?   More like The Great White let you live..   Next time jump into a pool..

shark: whatsup bruh..

Shark went home and told all his homie he was attacked by a human

human stupidity is infinite

So where is the fight ?  All I saw was shid in draws !  Lmao 😂😂😂

Dude you're lucky, I was scared myself
That &quot;Holy shit&quot; at the end it is the point where you understand that it is a scam.

youre not that tasty bro

This why I say people that swim in the ocean are stupid, you’re just a giant fishing lure.

He is alive bcs the shark wasnt hungry

Friend: 🚨“Shark! Shark!”Man swims in search for the shark 😂. Balls of steel.

Why will this fake video not go away

That was really well edited I almost thought it was real!

I almost got a heart attack

It would be scary if it was not fake.

Fake

i Hate Australia and i would never live in australia not for a 10000000000$

Everyone one when encounter a shark you give it the `Get Rotated` treatment

Bull bull bull
Aint no shark fighting.  Brown shorts, probably. 😂

Lucky mfer
FAKE

I did everything right. If he had swum away without turning around, she would have grabbed him. And so eye to eye he scared her away.
Fake

And the camerman always survives 😂

Not real🖕🏻
<a href="">0:41</a> &quot;numdudbdjfkfkkgkf&quot;
Fake footage

I love sharks , but panties would  be brown

If someone screamed shark you wouldn&#39;t swim towards it and start swimming underwater

What gives away that it&#39;s fake is that you wouldn&#39;t start looking underwater if you know there&#39;s a shark, and at the start he goes towards the opposite direction from where he should

“I wanted to talk to you about your extend car warranty”- shark

shark wasn’t hungry I guess, appeared to just be investigating the disturbance

Yo

It’s not for nothing that they put a fence there; it will be a lesson for the next jumper. Now every night he will piss in his sleep from meeting a shark.
People taking this easily never faced any danger in there lives. If this is real it one of the creepiest videos on youtube.

His friend yelled &quot;shark&quot; as soon as he jumped in 😄

This looks ridiculously fake.

Ya lucky this wasn&#39;t a tiger shark...

Honestly, quite well done, the shark footage is composited (Mostly) seamlessly. Hollywood awaits.

That HS at the end has cracked me up 😂

Man: jumps and started screaming splashingShark: wtf his doing?

1. At what point is he fighting? Seems like only fleeing.2. Is that real, or they played it + inserted two shark captures?

idiot

Moron alert
Why swim where there is sharks so irresponsible, glad the guy was ok .I never swim when I&#39;m on holiday where there is sharks .

Fake

Sharks dont joke around.
Jerk.
CGI everywhere

fuck no

If this was real I think that dude would&#39;ve been eaten. He&#39;s doing everything you shouldn&#39;t do. Flailing around, turning your back to the shark... those are all things that indicate you are prey to the shark. His ass would&#39;ve been devoured.

Only why I survived a shark attack was because I shit my pants. Shark had no match.

Suddenly a gallon of adrenaline enters your blood stream as a gallon of shit enters the harbor.

Plot twist. As he climbed stairs, he slipped, fell back in the water, and was eaten by shark.

It shows that it is fake
Wasn’t this video proven as fake?

Fact mine be like :- mene bata to tha

Fake

He fought it off?? No if that shark wanted to attack it for sure would have.. that dude was shitting bricks sharks know when you panicking.

Faaaaark that😵‍💫

Wait for the shark to latch onto your leg and then get a mate to jump off the cliff and give him the biggest fuckin people&#39;s elbow the world has ever seen

Simon Nellist 😢

Nope’stralia.

The underwater screaming is hilarious 😂😂

What a dope.

Dude Australia is seriously crazy.

Fake

When my friend shouted: “Shark!”, for some reason I thought it was an act. How did he see her at such a depth?
Smart... He knows the cameraman always survives.I&#39;m taking a camera next time I go swimming in the ocean.

fake

Feels pretty fake

This video has been debunked. It&#39;s an absolute fraud.

It was all fake. It was a marketing campaign by GoPro

she said ur my hero what the

Shark bait hoo ha ha!
Great white shark didn&#39;t even care XD.

Faking it: headline-making viral video hoaxes were funded by Screen Australia

FAKE

This video is faker than a Kardashian’s tits.

motherf*cker..... this man is lucky

I&#39;ve never seen someone&#39;s dick shrink so quickly 😂

This video has been debunked many times and people still believing it lol

“Fight” - more like flailing slowly and nervously. You can’t fight a monster like that underwater.

wasn&#39;t this faked?

It’d be more convincing if the acting was better and the camera wasn’t being jerked around so much.

I can still vividly recall the time I swam out about a mile with friends, looked down, and saw a great white moving up toward us.  I screamed, started swimming, and it took me a good while before I stopped to make sure my friends were coming behind me. I believe bears and sharks hold the same etiquette to eat the slowest.

Thets truly fake

It&#39;s always the final moments before they get out of the water that are the most tense. I imagine them suddenly being grabbed and dragged down to the briny deep, screaming and bleeding to death as they&#39;re thrashed about like a rag doll. This is why I don&#39;t swim in deep waters.

He was lucky

Fugazi
OMG! Inland waters are rich with nutrients so more sharks will be coming to shore

Sooooooooooo fake the shark teapots

As long as he wasn&#39;t bleeding or nothing he should&#39;ve been fine

Maybe that GIANT SPIKED FENCE was put there for a reason.

Man survives the ocean suddenly changing color and a shark appears

That &quot;MMMMBBBBRRRRGGGGGGG&quot; gets me everytime!  LOL!

That’s intense!!!

Rather him than me 💯

Oh so thats why cliff jumping is dangerous

<a href="">1:03</a> He told the shark to stay away or he would kick its nose, and the shark turned and walked away scared. That was really crazy

I don&#39;t believe that is ture🤣

The shark makes me jumpy.😂🤣

Omg

The shark : hey bro, just came by to say hi

Meanwhile the Shark is probably all like &quot;What up dude?&quot;

Awesome footage.

She probably already had lunch before...
<a href="">0:40</a> when nature anger

Shark dealing with the noisy neighbors again: <b>What business do you have here?</b>

This is Australia the guy is Australian he should know that sharks are in their  total bellend.

Fake video, but excellent production.

i understand the shark seemed relaxed, but boy i woulda shit myself right then and there LMAOO that shark was way bigger than the average human

Currently dropping a couple of sharks in the toilet bowl while watching this

He was doing everything you’re told NOT to do in this scenario

Where you from ordered this Shark Robot I want to buy it

I seen the sharks shadow before he jumped pay attention and that shark was curious if he was hungry you wouldn’t have made it to shore

I like the Shemp with his head in a fishbowl audio.

Terrifying!!

I greet you, my father
Why do you panic, just wanna sniff your stinky skin!

When did he fight it off ??? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Mf😂😂😂😂

this was confirmed fake it’s not even the same shark in each frame

That shark gaved you 43 Million views

I really can&#39;t understand, what do Australians thinking to jumping into water where there are crocodiles, sharks, etc

This is real!

Easy dislike.  Clickbaitingcunt.
How IS IT Fake ITS so real omg😮😢💀☠️☠️💀☠️💀☠️☠️☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀💀💀☠️☠️
he didnt fight it off that shark spared his life

More like pissed himself than fight off.

Years later and I am still surprised at the amount of people who believe this is a real clip... Not only do they believe but will argue about it being a real clip when a quick search of the internet will confirm it is indeed a very well edited video and so are several of their other videos. Well done to the editors as years later people are still coming back to talk about this.

4,5 metra

your fighting a male great white shark

How tf do you define this a &quot;fight&quot;? Didn&#39;t even contact each other

Incredible

Sheeeeeesh!!

Fake

Its now 9 year since this video dropped and still gives me a Goosebumps.

I like how the video title says he &quot;fought off&quot; the shark despite the two of them never once making physical contact in the slightest.

And if he's so stupid and hops in where there are sharks. Your own fault. In addition, the shark itself was just curious - no one would have seen it if it attacked.
Thos video is fake as fuck people. Not real. Great whites like open water  not that shit. And I&#39;ve seen this video before confirmed to be fake

Yeah. Australia&#39;s waters are lovely. But, from a comfy beach chair. Hell no would I ever get in the water.

Why do yall dumb assess do that shit

i do not believe i would ever swim off the coast of Australia.

hope hes ok

&quot;Sir? Sir! I&#39;ve been trying to reach you about your car&#39;s extended warranty&quot;

Australia is the place where you can test your mortality 😊.

Fake.

This performance is missing critical ingredients. Upon existing the water there is no sign of uncontrollable shaking and simultaneous puking and sh*tting

Shark “Jesus Crist bro, calm yourselfdown, you’re giving heartburn”

Just so everyone knows: If there&#39;s a shark in the water with you, DON&#39;T START THRASHING AROUND! You&#39;ll trigger its instincts and it&#39;ll bolt after you, thinking you&#39;re a seal!

It’s so funny that I met you when I jumped down 😂
Oh my gosh

Bro did everything wrong trying to get out of the water. Flopped around like a fish 🤣

Kicking and panicking is the worst thing to do when face to face with a GW. They think you’re an injured prey. Stay calm and if you have to gently push their nose  to divert them away

The most staggering thing about this video is how far down in the comments I had to scroll to find someone who didn&#39;t think it was real

Hire better actors.
Iconic meme

Props for the professional underwater footage shot 😮

Is this confirmed real? I mean it looks almost too good to be actually real lol

This was that video that went viral years ago, fake, if I’m not mistaken… I forget? I think from what I can recall, there were a few mistakes that the editor made… However to me it looks amazing. 99.9% sure that this was not real. Does anyone remember?TIMING OF “SHARK 🫵🏼… location, you’re not gonna find a great white that close to sure where there are no seals or reason for it to go inland like that… (beyond super low percentage), the color of the water is much different before he jumps, too bad water. It would’ve been much darker as you can tell from up above… It is a great job, though by the production team who made this, I’m actually more impressed with this, YouTube, video that I am many many movies that have this type of scene! Unreal! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼‼️‼️‼️‼️ no why would I give this a thumbs down, congrats to whoever made this! I know it is not real, but it is still a job well done when people have to actually research whether or not, it is fake or not! Props🎯‼️‼️‼️❤️❤️❤️

It’s fake but nice editing.1. The guy jumps into the water in the shade but when under water, the sun is shiny through the water.2. Only small ripples where he jumps in. But under water there is suddenly there are waves.3. He lands close to rocks/cliff, but no sight on and rocks or anything under water.4. The under water shots are Cleary edited from an ocean swim.

<a href="">0:59</a> here you can see that it is false
That was close! The shark almost got killed by that crazy Australian 😮 I hope he&#39;s doing alright 😢

Alternate title:  Fake video proves Great Whites don&#39;t like to hunt humans. Shark checks someone out, decides it&#39;s not food and moves on. Scamming Atention Whore:  I FOUGHT OFF A GREAT WHITE!!!

Wasn&#39;t this debunked to be fake?

That idiotic face at The end...

I think this video is fake.

can someone please get this fake shit off the internet

He fought off a great white don’t think so

I didn&#39;t see him fight off no shark the shark was just curious

Shark:WTF! someone just jumped into my bath

Should’ve said you were John Cena

Australia .... ALWAYS FKNG AUSTRALIA!!

I lived there about 13 years ago and I would watch people just casually swimming through the harbor. No way I’d have the courage to do it lol

faiquedemaiskkkk
Fake

It's funny, I've never laughed so hard
This shit is fake

Wtf

Crazy man! Thanks God,he escaped

Glad the guy is okay.  But there was no fighting as such.  The shark was curious; discovered he was alive, and lost most of its interest.  You survive as a big predator in the ocean by not taking risks and not eating things you don&#39;t normally eat.  Which isn&#39;t to say that people don&#39;t end up eaten by these things, but we aren&#39;t high on their list.  A nice fat seal on the other hand...

Fake.

The video is fake

i actually thought he was gonna kick the livin balls out of that shark XD

The jump was a C grade.
Even in Australia, you&#39;d never expect that to happen and in a flash! Thrilling at the same time, though!

Edit is spotted on <a href="">1:00</a> i guess

You mean &quot; guy is remotely near nature&quot;? He didn&#39;t fight anything off lol

Nice CGI

Stop splashing around so much...thats what draws his attention

These idiots need to be eaten ❤
This is fake

- Dad, what we&#39;re doing here?- Look, a food will fall from above

Idiot! Stay out of the water!

Don’t kick him you actually think your going to win against a big white

&#39;Holy shit&#39;

Never splash like that in a potential shark attack situation is what I learnt recently

beautilful fake 😂

This is fake!

fake

If this happened to me I would probably never go back in the ocean.

The chance of surviving this is low

Exactly Australia is a great place to visit online it&#39;s basically a death trap four terrorists and for scuba divers who ever wants to swim out in the ocean in my opinion they aren&#39;t crazy they enjoy it so go for it it makes you happy go for it but just remember you&#39;re in their neck of the woods. And a lot of people don&#39;t understand this great white sharks usually will attack you from underneath so by time you realize you&#39;re being attacked you&#39;re already in its mouth and being ripped in half not a good way to go out at all being ripped in half and drowning at the same time and then they&#39;re going to probably go deep and drowned you your ears probably won&#39;t pressurize your eardrums will probably pop it&#39;s just not a smart idea to go into the ocean for any reason. I hate the beach I hate the ocean and I hate every single f*<b>***</b> shark there is in there. They&#39;re supposed to be docile and there&#39;s not really that many shark attacks they won&#39;t bother you don&#39;t worry about it all blah blah blah scientist always try to protect them but the sad reality is especially great whites AKA Carcharodon carcharias these sharks are absolute serial killers when it comes to stocking their prey namely humans, seals other sharks other types of fish tuna they know what we taste like and they love humans to eat.

Aint no way this real

That's what happens when you jump over the fence.
fake trash

You can see the shark at the start on the right corner if you look closely

I remember watching this years ago but did not know it was wear I lives

Aaahhh yes Australia, home of Box jellyfish, great white sharks, deadly taipan snakes and box spiders. Very deadly place. Not to mention a government that will show up to your house and carry you off to a concentration camp at any time. Sounds like a wonderful place.Much better than America with our over militarized police force who kill at will with impunity. Our mass shootings every 3rd day, our politically divided population who are armed to the teeth and brazen criminals who will carjack, rob , rape or kill without consequence. Which place do you think is safer?

Escape from planet sharks

That shark said mmmm my food delivery arrived

This video is fake I know it

You gotta be kidding me.. Great white shark in that depth.. Is this even possible?? I used to think that they only roam in the very deep of the ocean..

His face in the end😂

Fake video

Fake off
Isn&#39;t this video fake?

It’s crazy that people still think this is real

Lets be real, if the shark wanted to he could ripped the guy in 2....he was just seeing what all that ruccus was about.

And that is why I only swim at public pools

Oh you safe

RIP

If you swim in the ocean you DESERVE to be eaten.  Wanna try again?

FAKE

My nightmare just came truth but glad it’s wasn’t my me. Thanks for sharing. Unedit and raw footage. My heart was racing!

Holy  Shit!!!

Man, I&#39;m good. I knew this was fake before even seeing the footage. I can just see right through this.

Making all that noise and splashing only draws them in more, worst thing to do is panic. Just swim, and watch your back because if they get too close you can attempt to redirect their noses.

This could have ended in a different way he’s a lucky man

Fake..... photo shopped

Australia seems like SUCH a dangerous place😂

what an idiot

The last thing he did was fight off the shark. In the first place the shark was not attempting to attack him. In second place he panicks and swims moving his arms too much. The last thing you should do if you ever see a shark

Look twice before jumping

Why do people jump in the ocean like that? You fools have no idea what’s in there.

I would have chummed the water, with ,&quot;brown and yellow,&quot; not on purpose though..😂

Literally can see the shark before jumping in and still jumps in 😂Then proceeds to flail around and splash about to attract more attention from it, and calls it fighting off the shark 😅He wasn&#39;t even attacking anyone.  Just swimming around.Sharks ain&#39;t that slow when they&#39;re attacking. He was just cruising around seeing what the fuss was about

I watched this video back in Vietnam. 🥱

Dumbass.

Give that man some new swim shorts please 😂 wow bet he won&#39;t be jumping no time soon lol

&quot;Hello brother, have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior?&quot;

Fights off? Typical bullshit.

Fake

The shark is just a fool...!!!!Just eat him.....!!!!!🤨

I&#39;d have coloured the water brown!

To-go order refused-
Imagine if this was real😳

it must be an aussie rite of passage XD 👍

I think that&#39;ll about do it for the cliff diving..

Bro that shark was just seeing what he was.  He showed no sign of aggression. Just came up and being nosy and its dudes over here screaming in the water.

Surely he knew there was a chance he’d encounter a shark before he did this! The world is full of fools, but they usually don’t live long.

This video is supposedly a fake edited video

This shit is fakeThe shark would 100% attack anyone who jumps into the water like that

When he got out and looked out over the water I said to myself &quot;holy shit!&quot; I&#39;m not disappointed he had the same sentiment 😂 wow! That was quite the experience he had!

Only idiots jump into water where sharks are

He didn’t fight off that shark . It was curious not hungry.

This is fake

Every resident knows that on that specific spot &quot;Harry&quot; is swimming  around. It&#39;s his home-ground. Multiple encounters a month took and still take place right here, on this spot. Every local would have warned you, but you got unlucky. Harry, that&#39;s how he&#39;s called, seems to be curious, but does never actually attack. Several people swimming came across Harry and he just comes up to them and leaves them be. On the other hand, I would not take the risk cause now a days Harry grew to like 16 feet. He became much bigger then here. But it&#39;s Harry alright,  I can tell you that much.

This is the moment when we realize that Life is a Lie😅

Shark 🦈 likes his dinner with &quot;a little extra adrenaline, please.&quot;

Jesus Christ dude,  you got concrete boots on?! SWIMMMMMMM!!!

fought it off???😂😂😂  It checked you out and went on its way.  MORONS

Too bad he didn&#39;t die for ignoring the fence and the sign saying not to jump

Fake nice edit though

This is why I don’t cliff dive!

Funny how AFTER guy hits the water THAT&#39;S when his buddies spot the shark

That fence was there for a reason

Hello, name&#39;s Bruce!

Everyone is an expert until they&#39;re in that exact situation. 😮

Hi, my name is Bruce!

I’m sorry but that shark was not interested in him at all 😭 sharks bite when they’re REALLY curious

It bet his ass won&#39;t be cliff jumping anytime soon lmao frfr!  Who does that and knows sharks are in the water? You ALL already know who🤨does! That was his lucky day!

Hell of a fight that guy put up. I was sure the shark had him!

Cgi

It was staged, the shark was in it with him lol

!😱🐬teres 🏞
Poor guy had a little dent on his nose

People still believing this is real lol

underwater humans are nothing

Pretty sure this is fake

This is so fake 😂

On today&#39;s episode of &quot;in the asscrack of hell&quot;...

Little does everyone know, this video is fake

The shark probably thinking about how this mf just fell right out the sky and survived. Id check it out too if i was a shark shit would get anyone thinking.

Shi fake af

Why so terrified, Jeez. Just give her a nose rub 😚

Fake as shit

Yall do the most stupidest shhhh bro

Bruce!!!!

That guy was lucky to have such an encounter; was no fight going on.

Poor Great White... He accidentally went into human territory waters... I hope he makes it out alive... I hope the humans don&#39;t eat him

Lucky mate.. that could have been worse! 🦈

Don&#39;t know which would have been worse....getting eaten by a shark or cut to pieces with contaminated oysters......Either way I bet he had skid marks in his shorts the width of the grand canyon....

Jumping into the ocean is like playing Russian roulette it appears, I love the ocean I love sharksBut from afar not enough to swim with them won&#39;t catch me in the ocean most of that is because I live in Michigan lol so I don&#39;t have to worry about that most we have is not so great lakes pretty safe to say won&#39;t be any sharks.  The way the shark came back it was wondering if you were food.

This video was proven to be fake…..edited.

I was waiting for &quot;it&#39;s just a prank bro&quot; from the friends at the top

Is this real?
