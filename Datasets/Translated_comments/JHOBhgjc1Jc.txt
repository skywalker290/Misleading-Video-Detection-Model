What did blud start saying after the lightning bro had me dying



I first saw this over 7 years ago and still think it&#39;s one of the funniest videos I&#39;ve ever seen

That shit must have been loud as fuck! The lightning strike is capable of rupturing your eardrums, it&#39;s actually well over the pain treshold of 120 dB.

A LOININ BOLL NEALI HEEEYYA

That thick Aussie accent

The lighting strike turned his teeth into marbles.

He did say it was dangerous down there

I can&#39;t wait for the English version

Lebanese English 
God says :No.

What has she done to anger Zeus

Thor was saying, Do Not Go In!   

that is the strongest Australian accents I&#39;ve ever heard. I live in Australia too.

I this a Russian Sylvester Stallone who grew up in Australia?????

&quot;allmagobbawbiyouorai?&quot;
Hold on, second I just found out this was fake by looking at the description, and they made other fake viral videos as well, damn! but this is still funny 

It&#39;s usually hard to make me laugh, but this one got me laughing so hard my ears hurt, and the comments makes me laugh even more.

the &quot;hiya&quot; at the end 

Why would you go out when there js a storm 

That accent 

oh no the consequences of my own actions

It takes a lightning bolt to turn an Australian man into a more Australian man

&quot;Ay baby slow down wait for me. Oh wow its pretty rocky heaheay.

Omgbabyareuarignt

Was he delivering a pizza for Pauly
JESUS CHOOSES COMBAT GEAR!!

Omg this broke my ears when i heard that lightning

I understood everything he said the first time I heard it. Am I insane?

This video is clearly fake for the following reasons:1) The colour of a lightning strike becomes pinkish-orange when it comes closer to the ground. It doesn&#39;t retain the milk white colour that we see from afar.2) The creator of this video clearly has no idea about how bright a lightning strike is, when it hits the ground. In real life, this tiny GoPro camera would have been completely overwhelmed by the brightness of the strike, based on how close the camera was to the impact. There is no reflection of the lightning on the ground either.3) If you look carefully at the place of the impact, you can see water splashing. In real life, water does not splash like that if it&#39;s hit by lightning. It just doesn&#39;t happen. Oh and speaking of water...4) The ground is extremely wet. In real life, the water would have conducted that electrical charge and electrocuted everybody around. Especially that girl/woman who was standing just 6 metres away from the impact.

... it&#39;s good to call on Jesus before lightning strikes ... &amp; afterwards, u&#39;ll probably be speaking in tongues !!! ... (-_&#39;|

And she&#39;s not dead?

The real way you can tell its fake without having to analyze the flash/water/pixels 1 by 1 looking for defects is simple. AS the lighting bolt is landing the girl starts reacting on the same frame. If this is 30 fps and she reacted same frame that would make her reaction speed less than 33milliseconds at maximum to be able to react that quickly (if its 60 fps then her reaction speed is pure fucking magic.) And that would be reacting to the LIGHT alone, not the sound which she wouldn&#39;t hear for at least another 58 milliseconds after the flash of light as the lightning bolt is at least 20 meters away and that&#39;s about the time it&#39;d take the sound wave to travel that distance to get to her ear drums. Not calculating the delay before the sound makes it to her brain of course either.TL;DR she reacted to light so fast the sound couldn&#39;t have even reached her yet at distances small enough to be actually impossible.

It&#39;s oh my Jesus come back here

Ok that&#39;s clearly fake! Everybody who knows anything.. knows that lightening strikes first, cuz light is faster then sound, and then the thunder always follows a couple seconds later! This is all done in one fell swoop! I call bullshit!

We all know this is fake right? The man is also putting on an accent. He&#39;s pretending to be Lebanese Australian when I think Media Watch proved he was anglo white as f Aussie. If he was Lebanese there would be SOME Arabic exclamations in there! His name is Richard Hughes hahaha

bro way dialect is that?

That&#39;s me answering a pop quiz

Boyfriend&#39;s metamorphosis:  from real Aussie to Bill Cosby (from Family Guy) in .001 of a second....

sounds like Bill Cosby omfg.

This dude has the coolest accent.  The first time I watched it I didn&#39;t know what language he was speaking, second time holy shit that&#39;s english.

&quot;Ooh ah it&#39;s pretty rocky here, ay?&quot; His whole performance almost sounded <i>too</i> woggy. Is he taking the piss? Dunno.Here&#39;s a theory from out of left field: He was making a funny video with his girlfiend, overdoing the stereotypical wog talk for the LULZ. When the lighting struck he showed genuine emotions such as fear and shock.... but he just stayed in character.Who&#39;s on board?

Russian Guy????? hahaha

I laugh so hard at this

I&#39;ve been talking like this all day lol

OMG PUT IT ON FAST MOTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sounds like terminator was high that day.

&quot;Almost&quot; <b>Hits a mile away</b> sure

R.I.P Headphone users

This has been proven as a fake. Made by an Australian production company known for cooking up hoaxes to get attention.

fake!!!!

If you&#39;re wondering what the russian captions say, here you go:- To Paris about municipality&#39;s work.- Here arrived in China.- And it cost&#39;s a lot, and will continue henceforth.- Doll ounce football overall weight.- 600 million dollars square, besides an intercept plan.Sounds like he&#39;s talking politics.

omg!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFUNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

When you translate the cc it says &quot;dollars an ounce football total weight millions of dollars square. In addition the plan to intercept&quot;

poor her
fuckkkkkkkk

So fake - really obvious from the sound of the &#39;strike&#39; amongst other things

OH MY FUCKING GOD

he sounds like bill cosby or at least like someone trying to imitate bill cosby

It honestly looks really fake but yet well done, how he conveniently stops in the perfect shot at the perfect time. Also how there&#39;s no other lightning apart from that strike, and lastly they walked by some rocks with a bigger heights than where the girl was

that's it ;)

At the moment the lightning strikes I recommend putting it at speed 0.5
For the dumbass&#39; saying he doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;true&quot; Australian, maybe that&#39;s because although this was filmed in Australia, the guy is actually from South Africa. If you actually bother to read the Dailymail article you would know that.......

Jesus come back here! oh my god baby the bloody lightning bolt just missed you! Holy bloody mother of god, Jesus, fucking, my god baby, come back, the lightning bolt nearly hit ya, oh my god baby... You alright?

the bloke sounds like he has a fake Leb accent.

I had to switch the speed to 0.5 to really understand what he&#39;s saying,

Obviously this reaction is fake. Otherwise the FineBrothers would already have sued this guy

Thats a heavy accent

Two lightning bolts talking to each other.She is shocking.

sleek the elite!

Dude this guy sounds like the one guy from deathklok

Actually, there were two strikes. Other one hit her bf

he sounds russian

He sounds like he ran into a wall.

lmao! did this remind anyone of supercalifragilisticexepialidocious! ?  it&#39;s like he blurred all words together!

Fak me his accent

fake 100%

&quot;She&#39;s&quot; cute... from what we can see at least.

If you were to stand that close to a lightning strike your ears would probably bleed.

AUSTRALIAAAAAAAAAAA

Thats Why Australia suks

Is this even funny to Australians? I mean that&#39;s just how they sound right? Haha jk. But really through......

Even if it is fake why can&#39;t we all just enjoy the video. I even think it&#39;s real

what is that accent ???

fuck Australia and their fake ass vids

Fake or Not, Shits Too Fucking Funny!

Just click cc at the bottom of the video and make sure it&#39;s in English. Word for word, the subtitles match up perfectly!

sounds like mouth full of shrooms....

it sounded like gibberish like he was just shouting words

Who cares if it is fake or not it&#39;s funny!

What a drongo his brain must have melted

that was cool

JEEZISWAPABLAGUBLO GITBAJHERIBLOD!!!!!!

LOL!! HAHAHA In a russian accent - Jesus come back here, oh my god baby the bloody lightning bolt just missed you. Holy bloody murder oh jesus fucking my god. Baby come back a lightning bolt nearly hit ya! Oh my god baby are you alright?

umm is he faking that voice

she has a nice ass. too bad her bikini bottom was probably ruined after that.

what&#39;s that language, im curious?

Thumbs down for vid, but LOL at the post-strike dialogue

What accent is this?

His reaction is priceless 

I thought this was real until I watched it at 0.25 speed and studied it frame by frame.  Now I am starting to think it isn&#39;t real -- however it&#39;s still a funny video either way.

Zeus is watching you

Who's here for Freshtorge?
Foo talkin with a mouth full of gummy bears

He was just rapping that new young thug

Don&#39;t care if this is fake it&#39;s hilarious
