Beached dolphins saved they were these mass strandings sadly are dolphins and pilot whales

They have spread the word among their species that we&#39;re friendly, for now.

This makes me think it was a test to see if they are still friends with humans. Dolphins are so intelligent that I really think it could be possible 

Thank you God for people like this in the world, may you bless them every dayüáßüá∑
There are zero women helping out. So often, when shit comes to shove, the ladies are well away.

Even dolphins use Google Maps apparently.

That&#39;s a great video. I will always cheer for you in Korea I&#39;m looking forward to a great video. Have a nice day.

God bless you

Wow, it's nice to help them 
God bless your heart. Two brave ladies.

Excellent work men
Glory be to the Creator, the Photographer

Gracias 
Absolutely awesome  restored bit my hope for the humankind

But why?

Why don't they take it away?
Really great, congratulations 

 Very nice

What a beautiful scene! Humans helping less fortunate animals.  I guess humans have a purpose too. This brought tears to my eyes.

Dolphins are not fish. They will not suffocate if stay out of water .  In that respect the &#39;savers&#39; timing was not that  critical. Maybe they should think of lifting each dolphin by pairs. Not dragging them by the tail.

I wonder if orca`s chased them in?

Greetings, bro, I&#39;m from Aceh, the beach is very beautiful... lots of fish come ashore, right?

I really think what people are doing to save dolphins so they don't die is beautiful.
I was amazed at the efforts of the men . The woman , who want equality just stood their and offered no help . 

Faith in humanity restored...

it&#39;s possible the dolphins were testing the humans,. and they reacted with compassion, community, a common unity, humans and dolphins together

Wow! Bottlenose dolphins!
Wow, when the man kind is at it&#39;s best.

What about the fish?

Good job bro

Love

It&#39;s like humans when they to suicide they get into the sea and when shark wants to suicide they get on land.

Dumm humans we are fine the tide was gonna rise in a couple minutes.

The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. Crypto is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak. Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I&#39;m an investor and am winning by applying the same method in every trade, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears) which is trading. Buy the Dip and trade, I have made over 16 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing trades with signals supplied by expert Jay Pelle FX .

So glad everyone was in the right place at the right time!!  but im so jealous of PPL walking by that has a better view of the actual dolphins!! seeing that YOU ,MR CAMERA MAN/GIRL was not helping y are you standing a whole continent away from the action ?

beauty in this world

Those dolphins were not stranded. Dolphins cam do that.

ad for apples new beach pod ^^now that must be some fabulous vacation spot for 30 dolphins to try to walk out of the sea - nah maybe they were hunting (hydroplaning) fish or they just got reeaally confused all 30 dolphins at once... maybe they didnt do this for the first time? or maybe..you can see that an entire group can be mislead by irritated leaders? hmm...  great atmosphere, everybody jumping in to rescue like they do this all day - and afterwards the cheering crowd - what a &quot;moment&quot;. faboo

Hi

Great job guys, and let&#39;s not forget that dolphins help humans at sea too, especially against shark attacks.

Amazing how they help them get to the sea right  away , without  taking pictures.

NO,There&#39;s a monster out there!!!

dolphins: LET THE INVASION COMMENCEdolphins: ...dolphins: help....?
No one from them tried to catch the dolphins for their benefit.That&#39;s Great!!

Great

Damn humans! Our invasion has failed, but we&#39;ll come back soon with a bigger army!

Nice

this is why dolphins help human

They were probably chasing small fish. Lucky nice people where there to save them or they would have died.

Great work
On behalf of the dolphins, I would like to thank all the residents there
what the fuk, pathetic. They&#39;ll definitely be extinct, at most in a few million years. Ichthyosaurs were supposedly identical to dolphins, though even more specialized! No wonder they themselves suddenly went extinct in the Cretaceous [25 million years before the meteorite], if they did stupid $hit like this it&#39;s no wonder.

I wonder why they headed out to beach themselves, though. It happened so fast...As if something was perturbing them or trying to hunt them. Sometimes rarities won&#39;t happen just because... Plus Dolphins are one of the cleverest marine mammals. They wouldn&#39;t beach themselves like this because they miscalculated their swimming orbit, would they?  Still, &#39; Glad they were saved.

Awesome! :-))))

Nice

Nice. Happened in Brazil.

Come on, brother and sister, any channel, stop by at my place, I definitely fully support

The dolphins were like; come to my belly you fishy...... NOOOOOOOO!

Human being 
We also want to see. Does anyone know the name of this place? Please reply in the comment.
where is this scene from
Geesh let them try to save  themselves before you start &quot;helping&quot; them before they even beach themselves , just so you can feel good about yourself and for the admiration of the beach thots.

God bless every single of you angels

I THINK THEY WANNA BE STRANDED THAN BEING EATEN BY ORCAS.

God bless these kind people...<a href="">www.incmedia.org</a><a href="">iglesianicristo.net</a><a href="">www.pasugo.com.ph</a>

12 thousand Japanese people disapprove.

They were chasing (hurding) Jack&#39;s, or rays. They werent stranded lol. But nice to see people help them faster than wriggling out with the tide.

Dolphin pulls a stunt like that in China and they will kill and eat them.  Shows the cultural maturity and superiority of the western culture.

Dolphine: want to feed,Human: save the dolphineLol

The dolphins c@me to say hi

Awesome job people

Who in the FUCK gives 12k  &#39;&#39;thumbs down &#39;&#39;....is there really that many Trumpanzees viewing this stuff ???

Dolphins are not stupid, they new that if they beached, the hoomans would grab them and take them back to the water, they were needy.

Love how all the women stood there watching instead of helping. Ldolphins aren&#39;t light so that was impressive to drag them out. Several dolphins too

Claps Not Enough.....If they listen even Now..I could have whistle until I get exhaust..!! Life Savers ....and guy who given great Visuals.!!!! ^_^ ^_^

Great job everyone there!

These guys are amazing! Such a cool experience they‚Äôll remember forever. Poor dolphin I wonder what they were thinking

Thank  you humans thaj you love animais üá¨üá™üá¨üá™üá¨üá™
A huge Russian THANK YOU from Transbaikalia!!?
&gt;Hooray to the heroes!&lt; But why are all the women just watching? None got the guts to help out?

Fish demonstrated to remind humans not to destroy the marine environment around them
Jotaro approves
Dolphins visit people too...
I'm glad it was during the day when people were coming to the beach.
Looks like a mass suicide pact.   Maybe dolphins also have crazy religious cults.

They all came for suicide, humans saved them

Parabens!
Brazil.
Thank goodness enough of the men understood the danger the dolphins were in and helped them.

I can‚Äôt believe you counted all of them!!Me: 1...2.... 3....? I am tired 

Great job 
Useless women just observe but don't help
Only respect!!

From <a href="">1:54</a> to <a href="">2:00</a>, the gentleman with purple shirt is the fastest one. He already knows how to handle the situation and grabs the Dolphin from his tails while others try to lift them from the middle of their bodies. Maybe ha had done this before; nevertheless, credit to all of them for helping these magnificent creatures back to their natural habitat.

But how many clumsy and useless people exist!!!
BRAVO  and thank you from The Netherlands

Notice how the dolphins just relax when they got drag. They know the human was saving them.

Notice that MOST of the people helping were men? Everyone wants to be a cowboy/hero. Couldn&#39;t risk looking weak in front of their partners/family.I suspect this because most of them would not behave this way and they see people in need of help on a daily basis.

The Sounds From the dolphins 

Great work
There are good people on the planet.

Ty and God bless you all

Cooperative people

Bravo! 
Well this shows that men and women are equal but women are good at something and men are good at something else.  You can&#39;t say men are good at anything so are women.  We should respect each other like how these women let the men do their job and gave applause to them.

Crying crying .thank all off you can not talk more.

I do not have marine knowlidge, but was thinking maybe the dolphins saw/sensed some danger in the see not visible to the naked eye.

That was so beautiful and awesome to watch those little sweethearts be saved by amazing people. Also I can‚Äôt help but notice that 12,000 people disliked this video?! Wtf is wrong with you people?!

This place is beautiful by nature... Prainha de Arraial do Cabo.
Thank dog they was dolphin, imagine if 30 of orcas...

Those Dolphins were trying to escape being hunted by Orcas. This Beach is a place with mounts at two sides. They had no way to escape else the dry beach. See one of the Orcas at <a href="">01:13</a> minutes.

10 star post you&#39;ve gained a Fan hereby the way I&#39;ve a small educational channel and It will be awesome  if you would join my youtube channel familyAll the Love

So much wonderful things to do by many people help out dolphins in water back to ocean Ô∏èÔ∏è

My first thought was the dolphins wanted headpats ._.

They are all the best men.

Pulling from the tail may hurt their wings 

Decent ! Well done people

That is called restitution to the planet to life
Waves push with more force in sea shore. So dolphins were not able to return. . Life is not that easy for animals ...Human should be protector of these animals

()n   
()n   
Why do people just film the save and not help when they see a lot of dolphins on the land

these are the guys
people r just standing there just help them for cries sake

May God bless each one of you


I am soooooo soooooo happy it happened during the day while bathers were out ..  Thank you to all for saving these amazing creatures Ô∏è

SAVE THE DOLPHINS! DONT BE AN IDIOT WHO TAKES PICTURES OF A DEAD ANIMAL!

Wow great job Ô∏èÔ∏è
I hope this was a natural phenomena and not ELF waves shocking them to shore.  Good job guys.

Thanks to all of you to save dolphins

It happened in Brazil, Arraial do Cabo, Prainha Beach

 These folks are in my prayers!!! The sooner people realize that us humans aren&#39;t the only 1s who need help, the world would be a better place.  &#39;2 friends are better than 1. That way, if the 1st friend falls, the 2nd friend can help him up&#39;.  This is in the BIBLE!!!  

Half the idiots sat there watching

Wow amazing nice ples  and subscribed New friend
They always help us. So it&#39;s time to return the favor.  God bless these kind souls .

Wow...! 
‚ÄúSo long &amp; thanks for all the fish!‚Äù

They were going on land to become humans you dumb shi+s they&#39;re evolving.

Great job... Thanks

The instinct of us humans wanting to help these Dolphins, is same as what I believe the Dolphins&#39; instinct of wanting to help us humans from Shark attack, drowning etc which were reported several times before.

I love this people

<b>SAVE THEM DOLPHINS WOHOO!</b>

I know its not right, and they need to be in the wild,  but I know if I was there, some part of me would of wanted to keep one,   Great job to everyone that helped out...

It's nice to see people saving these creatures....even if others prefer to watch them in their troubles.
chinese people will eat them all

Anyone who saves a dolphin automatically goes to heavenÔ∏èÔ∏è
The real Humans...

Gracias 
Good deed,
Thank you guys super well done

april 2, 2020 there was even a wild dolphin ( a thumbler, also to find on youtube now) in The Netherlands, followed a ship more day&#39;s. He was stranded 

after even swimming through a lock with the ship, stranded in a lock of Amsterdam. They managed it after the second time to release her to the sea with a boat again, again through the lock. I hope he find his way back to France in a healthy way, where he was coming from. I hope he will survive, our sea water is not so clear and there is a lot of ships sailing there and through the France-UK Canal.A dolphin traveling through the Canal and through a lock, very very rare, especialy in The Netherlands. Why would a dolphin do that in the first place in such busy and dirty waters?

This is the way we are supposed to be.  Have compassion for other animals with the exception of rats and other pests.

Good job everyone!!!
So why is there 12k dislikeasDo i swe humane? Do i see abuse? So i see anything bad?What are you disliking this video for?Also rhe cmameraman suck at holding his camera....

Once you watch enough of these &quot;animals being saved by humans&quot; videos you start to see a pattern. 95% of the time it is MEN who go out of their way to save animals. This video is a perfect example. All men helping while the women stand around and gawk. Us men really get a bad rap for being evil animals when in reality we are the more altruistic of the sexes.

They were probably escaping from the Orca&#39;s killer whales.

What is it?

apparently they not that smart after all

Did the tide bring them in?

yay happy ending for the dolphins!

The dolphins were running away from predators

Bravi

The dolphins are fishing. They use this technique to corner their fish on land and then slide back to sea with the waves. But this technique can at times get them stranded. But maybe they took a bigger risk by going even further to land knowing there are humans there that will help them back. Clever dolphins haha

Great Job

30 men 0 woman helping 
These people are all heroes, God bless them with happiness in life and the animals too, there are tears in your eyes when you see this!!!!Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
in these bad times for everyone around the world things like this make you smile again .

Heheheheh so sweet adorable
Why did they all swim up on the beach in the first place? Strange behavior. :p

Mashaa Allah
Nice

You know if they beached in the wrong country they&#39;d probably just get killed and eaten by people.

I love dolphins, brought back my memories of the edge of pacific islets in tahiti while in vacation..watched them flies high and speedy movement..they are so beautiful ... big thanks to those guys who helped pull these creatures back to the sea..such a kind heart of yours..god bless all those who are saving sealife animals back to where they belong..thank you.

Didn&#39;t anyone notice that a man first removed his slippers, then removed his shorts and then go for saving the dolphins at the starting 

Quite amazing to watch at the beginning. They, the dolphins, seem determined to beach themselves. looks almost if they have been scared, running away from something. I sort of expected  to see the fins of some killer whales chasing them.

If they encounter Vietnam, they will capture and kill them

Ur not suppose to help dophind onto water because they could be sick or hurt that&#39;s why they are on land to not drown

God job  BRAVISSIMI

Who‚Äôs watching today?

Put down the camera numb nuts

Great people

Why not just pick them up by the torso ? Instead of dragging their entire body weight by their tails and causing stress and muscular tension/strain ? :/

Maybe we&#39;ll live together, side by side, no matter what terrain we live on little dolphins.Just not today...... not yet.

Glad to see all the women helping

I&#39;ve seen a whale get beached but never so many dolphins. Why is this happening?

I wish the whole world was like this when it came to saving animals

heartwarming to see humans do something right

Aww... yall did an amazing job:)  this is something I would love to do..

Dolphins are so beautiful. I am fascinated by the beauty of the sea water. People have many human hearts.

Where is the video from and where is it from?
A strange phenomenon. Why did they go to the beach? That is the question
Maybe they just want to be on Land

great peoples always do great work.

Gooooooooooooood

Maybe if you just left them alone, they could have made it to their bicycles and continued the race.  But nooo.  Y&#39;all gotta &quot;rescue&quot; them.  Typical humans.  This is why you rarely see wild animals competing in triathlons.

Why did they beach themselves though, were they running from something cause it seems like unusual behavior for dolphins anyway I‚Äôm glad these people helped, all it took was one person taking action, others followed suit, well done people

Where is this sea?

dolphin
Dumbass fish
Their starving to death, to weak to resist the tide.  3/11/2011 Fukushima Japan 3 complete nuclear meltdowns.  The ocean is dead so nothing much to eat, it&#39;s a wrap.

Kdk bro

They want to hangout in town, you guys dragging them like usa airline passengers.

Poor dolphins! But they were lucky. Well done people! They saved them! Thank you, thank you to them!!!
This is in brazil, araial do cabo .

hello 240p my old friendi have come here to see you again

Which place is this

Why would anyone dislike?

wonderful! !
Good job
Well done guys

They should use deep  net at least one kilometre away fron the shore

People everywhere people!
People everywhere people!
HUMAN PEOPLE EVERYWHERE PEOPLE !!!

If not in Aden or in Iraq, no one will return them to the sea. Anyone who lets them down immediately has someone let them down. 
Tfw u realize Dolphins breathe air

Usually dolphins save humans from drowning, quite the opposite here!

I'm in the mood for herring.
They were either hunting or something disrupted their echolocation sensors.They sometimes beach themselves to hunt but I doubtt that&#39;s what happened here. Great job stepping in though.

Thanks to those ppl for not killing it for likes on there instagram

The reason why dolphins and whales beach themselves is because the submarines are sonar testing and makes the mammals go nuts! They end up beaching themselves! Its messed up! And the people need to recognize this!

If we were, we would give them away
