&quot;i think im close to beating it guys&quot; <b>is still in the titurial</b>

This reminds me when pewds played ARK

“Do you die if you die in this game?”

i miss pewdiepie.

as a subnautica enthusiast, it hurt when he said &quot;I&#39;m assuming this is procedurally generated&quot;

This is fucking 3 years ago???!!!

2020 was 3 years ago...?

PewDiePie Nice 🐟🐠🐟

Pewds: maybe i should go towards the ship?So who&#39;s gonna tell him? 👀

Ahhhh, it’s always good to see people overstocking on mushrooms on their first run.

pewdiepie says this game is so beautiful 2 secs later ew ew ew this game is disgusting

There are something worse then sharks...

great video! Im trying to learn how to make videos and yours are one of my inspirations. I have some videos up of subnautica and Im improving a lot because of you I think.

since the very first playtrough hes ever done pewds has been talking to inanimate objects i wonder why

I came here after days of following the news about the missing Titan sub.

felix! why are you always sucking on my toes

You are scared of creatures of the safe shallows its safe for a  reason

Pewdiepie I minute after being alone “my best friend fire extinguisher “

I don’t know why Indians hate pewdiepie both are good. Btw pewdiepie please don’t bully me I find you more interesting than T-series

<a href="">10:35</a>

Hes right

PewDiePie: A grown man playing like a child.

This has to be one of the greatest games I&#39;ve played.

<a href="">10:07</a>

PewDiePie next play subnautica below zero

Pewdiepie: Mushrooms!!!Literally all the people who play: plz no

<a href="">15:36</a> &quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating this game&quot; When he hasn&#39;t even made a base ;-;

I wonder if he will also get the fear of the ocean by the Aurora way witch is the hard way

As a reward, I shall give you my seed.

There are no sharks

BUTIFUL

Why do I have so many mushrooms - Felix, 2021

I played this game on my computer.But I don&#39;t play it anymore.Subnautica&#39;s still on my computer.

👍👍👍👍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

I have that game

Here before 40k

<a href="">3:07</a> same reaction of me seeing that lmao

I feel like every youtuber always grabs an inventory of acid mushrooms on their first playthrough.

This will be a good series

Pewds: finds titanium in Limestone &quot;YEEEEE&quot;Subnautica players: ...

Of course Sean recommend subnautica to him 😏

<a href="">4:58</a> every guy watching recognized this hand gesture

“Do you die if you die in this game”

to get seaglide you need to scan all 3 fragments

they fart poison

Honestly you probably chose a good time to play it. it&#39;s had a lot of updates since 2014 and 2015. and improved greatly

I love that he asked if there’s sharks seconds before encountering the Sandshark

Yo can make Titanium Out of Metal salvage

experienced players watching this and wondering why he didn&#39;t make a scanner

No shocks do you see monsters will kill you

Bruh his aurora wasn&#39;t on fire?

please bellow zero next

<a href="">4:37</a>. no its actually not procedurally generated, but you can spawn in different parts of the &quot;spawn&quot; biome

this is the perfect example of unity can look better than unreal engineUNITY DEVELOPER GANG 4 LIFE

do part 2 plz

<a href="">3:58</a> is that no way

The amount of acid mushrooms he picks up in the beginning makes me sweat 😅

New pet: cuddle fish

Pewdiepie: Are there sharks in this game?Everyone who’s ever played this game: I wish

I just love the undertale reference

Not even 4 minutes and he found leviathan.

&quot;Do you die if you die in this game?&quot;

😏🤐

“I think I’m close to beating it I’ve been playing for a while”

I&#39;m a part of your nine year old army general pewdiepie

&quot;Maybe i should swim towards the ship&quot;<b>HAHAHAHAHA</b>

Why does every beginner Youtubers for this game always pick up way too many acid mushrooms lol

I don&#39;t play this kind of game very much, but after vivid explanation and demonstration, it seems to be very interesting.

<a href="">14:30</a> what is you your dead that&#39;s what you is 😂😂😂

The most unsatisfying part is him looking for titanium and going past sm metal salvage

Levithen

seeing pewds going through what i went through feels sooo relaxing

Best game i ever played

Someone should introduce pewds to No Man’s Sky. It is like this x110% as far as building and exploration

Pewds: &quot;Maybe i should swim and get closer to the ship&quot;:Should we tell him?:No no, let the Man conquer his own fear.

I wanna see him go 600m deep.

You the best bro 🤗🤗🤗🍺🍺🍺

&quot;Can you have like a flipper friend in this game&quot;

Ahh your to big to plock!My mum next to me: o-O

<b>drinks bleach</b>

Glad you played it hahaha

Hopefully my Minecraft dog wasn&#39;t on there -pewdiepie

Pewds you should try the new Gargantuan leviathan mod when they release it😥

I think I&#39;m close to beating it because I&#39;ve been playing a wile.what you don&#39;t know

JESUS loves you very much and died for you 💔🙏❤️.

That is the most quick I ever seen someone find a reefback, xd

I slept on this game for a yearI&#39;m regretting life choices

O

dont say bad words or else i will unsub

I remember watching this during quarantine

idk why but subnautica always gives nostalgia vibes.

Felix: I assume this is procedurally generatedSubnautica: Cries

my anxiety everytime pewds doesnt scan something 📈📈📈

So sad he doesn’t make a play trough, i think he would have absolutely love the game.

<b>Collects every mushroom thinking it’s pretty or titanium</b>“WHY DO I HAVE SO MANY MUSHROOMS” 😂

“I think I’ve almost completed it” ha ha ha no we’re close buddy

Play subnautica below zero (its in early access so there is bugs)

I think I have nearly completed this game.Veterans: you’ve got like 30-50 hours left to play

Was swimming around 2 days and didn&#39;t figure out what tf I&#39;m supposed to do in game

yb better

I think I’m close to beating it. Hasn’t even fixed the starting pod lol

Who is your minecraft dogZoro

Felix: are there sharks in this game? Be honestMe, knowing damn well that sharks are the least of his worries in this game: <b>nervous sweating</b>

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

“I think I’m close to beating it” <b>literally hasn’t done anything</b>

&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating it. I&#39;ve been playing for a while.&quot;My guy hasn&#39;t even scanned a seaglide fragment yet is he for real

was the ship always that close?

Pewds&#39;s span in gaming is short and im glad he loved Minecraft

Just started the vid. Who else is waiting for him to encounter the leviathan with the name of Death minus Grim?

Him talking to the fire extinguisher was him losing his mind

Here in norway we use fishing rods

<b>REST IN PEACE</b>SubnauticaTerrariaCooking Simulator

Fun to watch

Kan jag träffa dig ås sokertopan I parken I knislinge?

I will never forgive you for killing that cow. It was so long ago yet my feelings do not budge.

It pains me that he didnt let himself enjoy the game as we all did.

I speak Deudchland 😆 ,,wie läuft&#39;s in Amerika?&quot;

Pewdiepie: &quot;I&#39;ve never played this game before, it&#39;s kinda nice.&quot;<b>*lightly plays pathetic Mode*</b>There you go PewDiePie, you&#39;ll have good pp-days.

bro the map of subnautica is so small compared to the planet, imagine you could explore the whole world

I have watched this 10 Times allready, please do more subnautica videos

How do I buy merch

Felix: i think im close to end i&#39;ve been playing for a while Subnautica players: keep dreaming Felix

<a href="">2:58</a> ei to tre hoppoo

You should try the mod return of the ancients.  It brings big canonical surprises to the game.

why does he not get the survival knife

The first thing people do in subnautica: gets high on acid

So the maps are different cause I spawned right next to what was basically the void

we cant see ur oxegyn

Pweds: I think I&#39;m almost done with the gameMe: Are you sure about that

Correction, it’s not a horror game it’s a terror game. The game makes you scared of what’s coming before it’s coming, nothing really kills you and that keeps the scariness alive and there at all time, terror not horror

Some random creature: makes satanic noisesFelix: “Shut up! Shut up! I’m Swedish and I don’t speak Deutschland!”

I started playing this game recently. my thalassophobia and submechanophobia is not having a good time

Pewd u are my fav now cuz you play this my fav game

i been playing this in vr so cool haha

FINISH THE SERIES! or else…

<a href="">3:37</a> Angry Jacksepticeye noises

Dang the next Minecraft update looks pretty cool

<a href="">5:29</a><b>impossible</b>

Come back You need to finish the game

Pewds:&quot; i think im close to the end of the game since ive been playing for awhile&quot;me who has played for 50 hours and still hasnt beaten the game: &quot;this is just the beginning&quot;

Hi

If you didn’t fill your inventory with acid mushrooms the first time you played the game, you’re not elite

&quot;What happens when you die?&quot;A: They take everything good from you, which is why you still have 500 mushrooms.

&quot;Don&#39;t hurt Swedish man in water ... We explode&quot;😂

Bro

Pewds: are there sharks in this game,2 seconds later encounters sand shark

Love ur vids

From the thumbnail I thought it was a cringe family friendly dad gamer

Fun fact: When pewds in the start said &quot;I feel like if that crashed it would cause a fricki tsunami or some sheet&quot;It probably did. Ryley Robinson (the name of your character) woke up from a concussion after being hit in the head by a medal plate that fell off inside the life pod during the emergency exit from the Aurora.This leads us to believe that a tsunami happened, but Ryley was asleep which could also explain why you arent as close to the Aurora as you would think as the tsunami would have pushed you away.(Note: I&#39;m not trying to hate on pewds i love his videos just wanted to let other people onto this theory lol have a good day)

AS A PERSON INTERESTED IN ROCKETS I CAN TELL YOU THAT SPRAYING A FIRE EXINGUISHER ON A FIRE IN A SPACE CRAFT WITH LIMITED OXYGEN  SUPPLY IS THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IT WILL KILL YOU FASTER

It is sharks yes, it is the Reeper

Came to this video fully aware of how goddamn cringey it&#39;s gonna be to watch. 😎👌

I had no idea Felix played Sub1, wtf!? 😱I&#39;m late absolute f**k, I know. 💀

this game is survival and horror game

&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating the game!&quot;<b>5 parts later</b>

Finish your series please.

I dont know why he didn&#39;t complete it

<a href="">15:35</a> not even close pewds not even close

Pewdiepie needs to play Outer Wilds

Please play subnautica below zero!!!!!!!!!! I think it’s better than the original

come back to the game ffs

Fills up storage with acid mushrooms, continues to dive deep and pick up more 🤣🤣🤣

&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating it&quot; <b>Still hasn&#39;t figured out the easiest way to get water, or really left the shallows</b>

Jack must&#39;ve had a real laugh watching this series

I wish pewds would finish this game :/

felix if you&#39;re reading this. FINISH THE SERIES

youuuuuuuuu curse

“This game is amazing!” 2 seconds later: “THIS GAME IS DISGUSTING.”

Me finding that pewds made a whole series on this:a surprise to be sure be a welcomed one

I wish subnautica would add a toggle run option... holding down my joystick is doing so much damage lol

if you have a thalassophobia don&#39;t watch.....

I love how everybody&#39;s first instinct when getting this game, is to get an entire inventory of acid mushrooms.

Jesus Felix, why do you have so many mushrooms

get a load of this guy, he thinks hes almost done with the game heh heh

um mr. pewdiepie you can find a friend its like a octupus  and its name is cuddlefish that you can play within

Experienced subnautica players referring to themselves as &quot;veterans&quot; is so cringey

even Pewdiepie cant avoid this urgent feeling of picking up tons of Mushrooms^^

<a href="">8:47</a> &quot;We explode&quot;Crashfish: <b>allow me to introduce myself</b>

a

Love watching him play games

‘Yea, that is titaniun’ picks up floater

Now you got below zero to play

Hope he plays the new one (even though the first one is slightly better)

Me: <b>Goes to creepvine forest on hard-core on first playthrough</b> Stalker: imma end this man&#39;s whole career. Me: <b>proceeds to not go in the creepvine forest forest for weeks</b>

He abandoned us, yet again.

<a href="">5:05</a>

A year late. But I wanted to wait until I got the game and then watch him play, anyways I want to see his reaction to the reapers

still waiting for him to give this game another chance

pewdiepie: did i call the spaceship a fish?veterans: <b>COUGH (lifepod) COUGH</b>

<b>white</b>

Why is he picking so many mushrooms 😆 I love it

When you realise his channel has had 27b views wow

there&#39;s a monster is creepy.

<b>euw euw euw euw</b>

The scariest part is it’s mostly accurate to the real world

Someone should make a 10 hour alterra boot up

Just watched jacks playthrough again. Never watched yours. Thanks reccomended

play subnautiker

My brain is hurting

That fish was swedish

Same, I fear the sea and forests. Plus. Infinity

Pewds: I kinda want to play this in VR, nevermind ill get sick.Veterans: I dont think being sick is what you should be worried about.

Pewds: plays for like 20 seconds and finds a biome I took 30 minutes to find Veterans: (ง •_•)ง

I have watched Felix since 20134 or 14 and i legit dont even remember he played this last year! I remember he played it but was it really last year? Saw zerkaa played it in 2018 lol wtf

my trypophobia in this video : 📈📈

Ahh yes Now I will subscribe

I don’t like pewdiepie

E

Things that make a reaper scary: fog that blocks your vision so he can stalk you, you hear him before you see him, he is probably the first aggressive type leviathan that You&#39;ve seen in the game so he scared you more bc you didnt expect it and now you have a slight fear of him. You will probably enconter him in a seamoth(for the first time is worse) and for attacking the little sub he has a &quot;special&quot; attack and it is designeg to bring you horor. So the fear of the reaper isnt actually him but the anticipation before the actual attack, whitch actually can&#39;t kill you or the seamoth in one hit.

&quot;maybe i should go to the ship???&quot;me who has beaten the game several times &quot;you have ultimately lost&quot;

I like this guy just like over 100 million people do

Every survival game has a pet minecraft this one idk if terraria counts

DE DE DE DE DE DE

YES now i can even scare me more even whit the deep waters while waching pewds ty for helping my mental helth

“Made with Unity”

Wish he took it seriously...maybe he&#39;ll do below zero n take it seriously

Felix: This game is so beautiful!Sea of Thieves: Am I a joke to you?

When anyone else says “imma get 1 million comments telling me I did it wrong” they are over exaggerating. When Felix says it he actually means at least 1 million people are going to yell at him saying he messed up. Crazy

555k likes

Cant believe he got Ruby so fast wow

<a href="">5:43</a> Did he just say &quot;The ocean has always been scared of me&quot;?

<a href="">15:13</a>

I don&#39;t understand why pewdiepie stopped playing this game

1  2 3 hej hopp och sket <a href="">3:00</a>

“Damn the game looks legit” -pewdiepie

Daddy Shark hates Pewdiepie

What is scary about this game

Game looks garbage

Conor mcgregor!?

Pewds: &quot;Is there sharks in this game, be honest&quot;Me: <b>laughs quietlly</b>

I just finished the game and came across this..... Wtf..... I DIDN&#39;T COLLECT MUSHROOMS!!

Imagine playing the game wrong

im really late, but yes there are sharks, i have one in my comtainment, i just got it last week so......

everyone’s first action in this game is filling your inventory up with acid mushrooms lmao

holy crap this was a year ago

love how pewdiepie thinks the spadefish was a reefback

PPPEEEWWWDDDIIIPPPIIIEEE

Imagine being 20 years too late to a game

<b>too lucky spawn</b>

lmao im so late but the fact he thought the floaters were titanium was just funny even though he was new to the game

I can&#39;t believe he approached the floater, saw it was called a floater, and said &quot;this is titanium&quot;

HuH

Pewdiepie: table coral 2 seconds later acid mushrooms! <a href="">3:26</a>

People in the present day we all know that felix just quit and disappointed us

I loved this game until I saw that I had to go beyond the shallow area and for a guy with thalassophobia I do not think that I will like the game

&#39;&#39;Full Playtrough&#39;&#39;

Swedish subnautica!!!!! Yes

I have thalassophobia but this is still one of my favorite games

Fish: Does nothing but yellow cloudsPewds: &quot;I can&#39;t murder them? That&#39;s unfair.&quot;

Every single player did this The mushies they pink i need more

Pogg

I love that every lets play he does he always makes friends with a non-living object.

<a href="">3:21</a> that is literally the first thing i did when i got in the ocean

Pewdiepie is dababby <a href="">0:02</a>

And with that, the series will never continue again..

I cringed so hard when he picked up the acid mushrooms.

I like Mr. Fuel Tank

My man should play the forest next especially since the sequel is coming out soon

<a href="">3:33</a>

we all had the mushrooms phase at the beginning

Glad Jack told felix about this game

It really is a horror game 😂

I love how ppl call subnautica a horror game when on ps4 its a 7+ age rating lol

Food

Pewds: &quot;it&#39;s ok I&#39;m not scared I have knife.&quot;

very nice

For your first meal to have been a spade fish and not a peeper... wow

I just got this game and it is pretty good so far.

<a href="">3:05</a> That’s the summary of this game

<a href="">05:40</a> no Felix it’s an europian thing

PewDiePie, Play Sea Of Thieves its... EPIC!

“I think I’m close to beating this” haven’t even gotten seaglide yet

I remember when i first played, i was in a cave and got exploded my the fcking cat/pufferfish.

Nu nu nu nu.You get titanium from metal salvage, not limestone

It was like a flashbang when he was holding the flare

Ur in urainas

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

He needs to make more subnautica videos

I’ve been watching you for years, and after 5 years I just realized I haven’t subscribed I’m so sorry 💀💀💀

I like how he doesn’t waste any time he’s like alright we is doing this

Pewds probably never have been in a beach.

ok . so im kinda getting the hang of subnautica now. i am playing the 2014 subnautica now . i already built the essentials like survival knife, scanner, repair tool,o2 tanks ,  radiation suit, and also the habitat builder. now i have literally no idea what to build. im thinking of maybe building a rebreather or a compass. im scavenging the blueprints for the seaglide too. should i start  building my base because i have the habitat builder ? any tips ?

I am from estonia and scared of ocean

Felix: I think I’m close to beating itMe:💀

Wait subnatica is a horror game

pewds: who will know what happensme: everyone who watched jack

Why is there a clip option

It’s pronounced led not lead

<a href="">5:00</a> casual ball scratching

pewds: maybe i should swim more toward the ship and see what i can findsubnautica veterans: nO

Still waiting for the next part

This game is fun

I think I’m close to beating it I’ve been playing for awhile. Jack with 75 episodes on his channel

I guess this is going to become the type of game I keep playing but never finish the story like MHWorld (60 hours in and not even on mid game yet)

<a href="">15:16</a> lol an aquarium to put in the aquarium you currently live in.

The word if watercheep win

Cuddlefish vs Minecraft dog!

one year ago, today

<a href="">14:34</a> subnautica creeper,!!!!!

Well I accually had my first reaper encounter when I thought of the dumb as hell idea to go the sand dunes.......I was freeked the hell out but made it out alive

@PewDiePie Hörrö, fortsätt med Subunautica :) Subnautica below zero finns snart med

How has it been a year already

UOOOOOOOOOOOOO🤩

Hahaha he’s scared of sharks geusse he doesn’t know about reapers yet

who is this bold man feminist gang all the way

Felix: “I am so good at this game though.”Me: You didn&#39;t fixed your life pod. You are not good at this game.

Felix: is afraid of a gasopodAlso Felix: isn’t afraid of a giant turtle squid

Subnautica subnautica subnautica

Always has been.

I’m really upset rn and I have to go to school and I can’t stop crying but thank god pewds exsists. Good thing I don’t have school tmr though I can cry all day

I really love torturing myself. Even though I have Thalassophobia, I still watch this 😀😀😀Even though most of the time, I just listen to Felix&#39;s voice instead of looking at the screen hahahaha

Him scared of gasopods leviathans

I wish he had at least gotten far enough to see the G.U.N.

You are so close I&#39;m a noob😒

<a href="">8:10</a> literally every subnautica player

Why every youtuber starts clauming tons of mushrooms

The aurora landed on an island

Next thing you know he finds jeb

felix is basically mincraft veteran doesnt know how to play minecraft

Pewds:i almost finished with the game me : laughing

I think I’m close to beating it me “HAHAHAHAHA no”

i know damn well all of us were going insane by the fact that he wasn’t scanning anything

pews: is scarred of oceans and dense forests also pews: plays subnautica and slenderman

It took him that long to play subnotica

<a href="">10:37</a> me when I have to watch my little siblings

Why are you playing in creative

pewdiepie like a seesaw, go game beautiful, then game ew

He should play the forest

The amount of mushrooms he harvests stresses me out

There&#39;s a sea dragon on 1200 dept

felix at <a href="">11:16</a> looking for titanium that piece of metal salvage :(

<a href="">17:26</a> lol Felix thinks he’s safe from the leviathan

Pewdiepie if you swim behind the ships thrusters you can get a pet leviathan

play subnautica below zero

Imagine if you were that one butt that was useless but raced to the escape pod. Imagine if the captain died because you had called dibs.

Felix when he got the o2 tank:Breathing is fun

Literally haven&#39;t watched him since the horror compilations but god <i>damn</i> I missed him

actually swimming to the big mothership for equipment would be the first thing i would do. judgin from the comments i wouldnt live long

shouldnt the first thing in a survival scenario be to find water? is this ocean not salty?

pewds:are there sharks in this gameme: nahh if thats ever thr case theres much worst

Pewds just confessed he never watched Jacksepticeye videos.

felix: i need titanium me: literally screaming metal salvage

&quot;A million people: you played the game wrong&quot;

you ruined it

Hei

Watched about 20 different youtubers/ streamers play this WHY DO THEY ALL FILL THERE INVENTORY WITH ACID MUSHROOMS

<b>test</b>

Pewds: Doesn&#39;t have a scanner and wants to go to the auroraVeterans: Anger intensifies

*grabs all the mushrooms in sightWHY DO I HAVE SO MANY MUSHROOMS

whowwww

&quot;This is so pretty&quot;wait until you get to the aroura when it explodes pewds... (people who played the game knows what i mean)

&quot;Will cause a tsunami&quot; BRUH ITS ALL WATER

Pronounce my name correctly

I can&#39;t tell if he is in survival or not

You should make a base

hahahahahhaaha

plock

Felix: I hate forests with a lot of woodMe: that&#39;s what a forest is

Awfull editing dude, all the time zooming on yourself ...what for? It is not funny, you are not 12 so it is no excuse there. Damn annoying, left on 3rd minute

It big flash is the dieettiä fish

So sad he didnt invest in the game or story :(

pewdiepie i have  subnautica

Who else is holding there breath while watching this?

please for the love of god!! Scan everything. Its like a main story to do so.

<a href="">6:50</a>if u close ur eyes and listen to him he sounds like a girl 😭

Why did he stop playing this? 😢😢

Felix: &quot;wow this is a beautiful game&quot; Two seconds later: &quot;Ew this game is disgusting&quot;

<a href="">0:15</a>“Jack told me”Of course he did

Imagine he found out about raft

felix : i dont like the ocean me : i dont like google earth’s ocean

GuY&#39;S iT&#39;S a mINeCrAft RipOFf

dude.... 9 months

so mewdiepie , have you tried the new arrival krabby patties with Extra cheese there  at KRUSTY KKKKRABS ??

I have played lots of subnautica and never thought of using a flare for light before torch and seaglide

Pewds- scared of gasopods.Pewds- loves reefbacks.

<a href="">13:54</a> :)you are :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

How did I forget he shaved his head?

I love how he calls this game fully finished

Pewdiepie be like this game is beutifull

fire no&quot;fire gone&quot;

&quot;are there sharks in this game?&quot;Umm no, but... You will see

i miss this

Bruh I don&#39;t know why he stopped playing this series was pretty good

I get really angry when people make mistakes in subnautica or spore so this is pretty much just me raging

My Sweden friends said hello :P

Hey Pewds please finish this series thank you

PewDiePie clearly didn’t put much thought into the power of a tsunami.

Hey it’s the kid from stranger things

this was so hard to watch felix lol

play raft

Pewdiepie: is thier sharks in this game?Me: well yes, but actually no.

In case anyone has not yet told you, this world is not procedurally generated.The map is fixed and there is a story plot that goes along with it.

I play subnotica on xbox

this game would be amazing if i didnt got stuck every time i played it

He basically made the knife cause he thinks its cool and did not think that he will made it to improve his suvival.Typical Pewdiepie😂😂😂

Felix might be the minecraft king but jacksepticeye  is the subnautica king

espanis

This game is a horror game for those with Thallassophobia.(The fear of large bodies of water)

Finish the game or peril

Ahh yes, another series felix didn&#39;t finish

Those gas mask manatees sound like fricken Tusken raiders.

Pls finish game

du spelar fel

<a href="">14:34</a> WHAT IS YOU?!!?!?! DEAD!!! THAT WHAT YOU IS!!!!!

First thing everyone does in this game is pick up acid mushrooms.The map isn&#39;t procedurally generated, your map is the same as mine.

Watersheep guides him in this world

Хоть он и не русский но.. смотреть можно

<a href="">3:40</a> its a reef back leviathan

U da god

Felix : Are there sharks in this game? be honest!Veterans: <b>psycho laugh</b>

Still waiting for him to finish the game

It’s called a gas o pod and it is pronounced peeper and the exposing fish has sulfur

I would love to see Felix play below zero

So  Swedens explode so that fish is swedens

Hey fellas this is a noob question, but may I ask how some people see the goggles on there screen and some dont? Is that just an option in the game menu or what?

I’ve waited 5 years for this

I’m so upset that he didn’t continue this ughh

Felix “this game is beautiful.”two minutes later Felix “eww are they f*cking that’s dis disgusting

a

Felix: &quot;It&#39;s so pretty, I love it!&quot;Also Felix: Never been underwater

I love how he passes right by the metal salvage when he&#39;s looking for titanium

KAPO

its so funny watching how similar our gameplay was, litterally its like he copied me lol

“i’m most scared of oceans and forests with a lot of trees” <b>plays minecraft and subnautica</b>

Have you played SOMA?

Dawg this game is awsome

Having just gone through the Subnautica experience, watching Pews jump into the game blind is so oddly enjoyable; every time he gets amazed or freaked out, I’m like: <b>I feel you</b>

This is hard to watch -subnautica veteran.

<a href="">2:59</a> svenska ja

Wow, he noped right after the first monster, that was epic

big iron

no there are animals bigger than sharks

Ja vi exploderar

I saw one meme and now I&#39;m watching this whole letsplay.

I like when he plays games but he dont play games that much any more really except among us but other wise idk

Lol that’s exactly what I did when I first played: grab as many mushrooms as I possibly can 😂

Pewds: sees gastropods &quot; WHAT the hell is that&quot;Me: You ain&#39;t see nothin yet

Never even finished the game

&quot;This is how we fish in Sweden, PLUCK PLUCK&quot;

<a href="">0:43</a> sven no. don&#39;t worry felix you there&#39;s a nice cat poster in the game. im sorry for your loss

You suck a this

Pewds: “I think I’m close to beating it”Everyone who’s played subnautica: it goes deeper

Your so cringey

Hej

I am titanium!!!!

<a href="">4:10</a> you like cheese pizza fish too? Hell yes, stuff those gills from both sides. Mmmm...

<a href="">3:07</a> my first reaction to the gasopod

<a href="">10:07</a>Pewds: Are sharks in this game?Me: <b>&quot;Just going to patiently wait until Pewds encounters a Ghost or Reaper Leviathan&quot;</b>

If you haven&#39;t already you should play ark and record it.

ew ew ew ew!!!! this is so gross. - pewds

Anyone else feel like Auto is worse quality than 1080p even if Auto = 1080p, or is that just me?

Hey Hey

You sound scarily like MxR!

blacksheep dsp bodypaint

This was soooooooooooooooo funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Ou can live under water

There’s no sharks in this game. There’s something more terrifying

If you like pretty survival games, play The Long Dark! No zombies also so that’s refreshing.

anyone come back to rewatch hoping he finishes the rest of the game?

<a href="">3:40</a> minutes in the game and Pewdiepie alredy saw reefback. World record

Jeg kan rigtig godt lide det her spil 🇩🇰🇩🇰I really like this game🇺🇸

Hur mår du

me before: subnautica is lame after seeing pewdipie : we live for subnautica

U should try the Forrest

Hey you should go to the ship for good

Did anyone else hella relate when he immediately grabbed all of the mushrooms? 🙋🏽‍♀️😂

At my school i sell G fuel and your flavor is the best seller.

*I think I’m so close to beating it, because I have been playing for a while”𝙋𝙚𝙬~

Me:Playing subnautica while watching this is epic gamer momentFelix:<b>gets vored by panel</b>

“Are there sharks in this game” everyone else: ummm yes...kinda...but worse

even aliens that are very scary

OMG TELL FELIX TO COME BACK TO THIS GAME

<a href="">15:37</a> ive played this game before and i laughed SOOOOO HARD WHEN I HEARD THIS

normal people play this game in 2016.pewdiepie play this in 2020

Annoying man-kid plays with head switched off.

Yo man I really love this game.

the real

should have played it in VR

I&#39;m building a custom pc and if I can get subnautica to look like this I&#39;ll be so happy

Hi

i subscribed to you

Sad that pewds hasnt returned to this game :(

My parents were arguing and shouting when i watched this. This took my mind off of it. Thanks pewds.

Well Felix doesn&#39;t have to worry about batteries...

Plot twist: when you escape the Aroura at the beginning, you’re the imposter escaping the ship after killing the crew mates.

6 months already?? felt like it was yesterday

It would have coursed a tsunami but due to gravity the aurora would have crashed fast there for your ship still wouldn’t have sunk

I’m noob I just got the game a need to watch a play through cuz I don’t know what to do

Lol fart fish

“I think I almost beat the game.”Veterans: <b>sigh</b>

Part 2!?😃😃😃

Lol he called the fart whale a farting darth Vader fish

You had such blonde hair Felix

I’m just glad he isn’t one of those noobs that craft a bunch of random things and doesn’t know how to use them

&quot;And I love this kind of game&quot;Me:Don&#39;t do this..don&#39;t give me hope

It’s darth vader fish

Pewdiepie: <b>says something</b>  Vetrans: Allow me to introduce myself

How is he doing so well

Damn he really found reefbacks that close to the lifepod? I didn&#39;t see one until I ventured like 300 meters away from the  lifepod.

I just got major amnesia the dark descent vibes when he said &quot;Just me and my friend fire extinguisher&quot;

subnautica is NOT procedurally generated game

metal scraps can be turned into titanium

PewDiePie: I think we’re close to beating the game!Me: actually not even 1%

There&#39;s one type of shark, the sand-shark.You encountered it here; <a href="">10:13</a>

You never know if you need lubricate-poods 2020

Im halfway through the game but from what I can tell... Ghost Leviathans are better than reapers

Him be like :let’s go to the big space ship.Veterans be like:there’s a reaper leviathan there LOL

Pewdiepie: <b>Breaks copper and gets it</b><b>*2 seconds later*</b> <b>Gets a pile of mushrooms</b>

ITS no sharks in this game🦈🦈

Sandsharks

“I love these type of games.” Doesnt even finish play through and skips some of best parts

Pewdiepie: Are there sharks in this game?Like 10 seconds later a sand shark attacks him.

<a href="">8:38</a>I’ve said this on countless videos, but this music “Into the Unknown”May be the BEST ambient music I have EVER heard.

Hey pewdiepie Do you onow SEA QUEEN?

Haha bald

How Swedish people react to an alien encounter <a href="">8:23</a>

How they make the first contact <a href="">3:49</a>

NICE

<b>i hope my Minecraft dog wasn’t on there</b> Me: and all your valuable shit ._. That’s not important??

Pewdiepie: Sick explosionme: <b>computer crashes</b>

I just love watching from new views pewds will be my carry

This is why pwedipie is the biggest youtuber ... Pure entertainment..

I’m good at that game your going to be good

I got this game in pretty release when it was first announced

Pewds: its like minecraft but not really minecraft.....HE FRICKING EXPLODEDMe: now thats  what you say a creeper

Pewds: we dont have much storage at all.<b>later</b>Pewds: still plcuking mushroms

Pewdiepie: god this is terrifying Me: it gets alot worse

Pewds I still don&#39;t like you every since you read that creepers are sexy hear me out fantasy

&quot;This is awesome, full of wonders.&quot;Laughs in reaper leviathan

I just got this game and im so excited!!

pewdiepie: horror gamesubnautica: PEGI 7

The funny thing is the fist things he grabs are 26266352616275453728 acid mushrooms....

İ like how pewds too lazy to a introduction

&quot;two things realy scare me. the ocean, and forests with alot of WOOD in it&quot;

The way he said hey hey I was dead

I have this but I need my game pass:(

<a href="">9:28</a> do you die when you die smh

Everyone’s reaction to the exploding fish “AHHHHHHHHHHHHH”

this game gave me thalassophobia

I miss this:(

Suddenly huge boost in Subnautica sales out of nowhere.

<a href="">8:54</a> famous last words

Why is he always so late to games like these

Little did he know he can play it in vr

I just finished subnautica I’m proud of myself!

<b>quarantine day 57:</b> revisiting the good old gaming week

i have subnautica but never played it yet. i will get to download it soon

The first thing everyone did in subnautica : got a shit ton of acid mushrooms

You should play astroneer it’s really fun it’s also a survival game

is there sharks in this game? me: um yes but no

2 hours in I think I’m close to beating the game👌🤣

<a href="">0:43</a> he would have even survived this m8

10:6 there are no sharks But there are more terifying things

there&#39;s legit no sharks in this game but something much much worse

Felix <b>takes tons of acid mushrooms</b>Veterans &#39;&#39;That&#39;s cute&quot;

(in swedish accent) WHERE WAS COCOMELON INTRO

Hey hey subnatica

Welp now I know what I’m doing on my 5.5 hour car ride today

Pewds died by oxygen at startMe: dies 4 times by putterfish in caves at start

<a href="">5:44</a> nope, most people find that horrifying

your so proooo!

Underwater tablet that actually works

I asked my mom is she can buy subnautica and she said: Su-na-u-hi-ca????

Did he stop playing?

i was eaten by the metal panel guys i&#39;m sorry-Felix 2020

hah I’m watching this even though I have thalassophobia

why does every single youtuber shit their pants at the sight of the gasopods....

You would think that playing hundreds of horror games that involve light sources, he would pay attention to the fuel of the lightsource, but no..Randomly using his lamp during daytime, watching the energy drain.. Also picked up over 40 mushrooms, and comes by some more and thinks, wow i&#39;ll definitely need more of these.Mate, starting to think you&#39;re not a real gamer

Felix don’t gooo to the aurora do it for your sanity

I am sorry pewdieipei but i do not like your voice

Bleach to disinfect water.   Aaaa

Felix: the ocean has always been scary to me.                                                                 Me: why are you playing this game this game can really terrifying.

Furlud papyrus:Pewdiepie:papyrus? Where sans?

are there sharks in this game?<b>far worse,my child</b>

why does every youtuber picks the acid mushroom as the first thing felix did and markiplier and I think jack

Can you send me the right cumputerAnd the game on it

Underwater stuff is always really scary for me, too, Pewds. Kudos to you for playing this! It&#39;s so cool to watch!

&quot;It&#39;s just you and me, Mister fuel tank.&quot; &quot;Okay, pewds.&quot; I laughed so hard! XD

You&#39;re the best YouTuber I love your videos and I and I love you

You play the game best you are better than me I just got the game so you are better than me and you&#39;re the best YouTuber on Nemo on YouTube

<a href="">2:33</a> nah bruh, that wouldn&#39;t cause a tsunami.. it would definitely cause some giant waves/ripples but they would subside. Nuclear bombs have been detonated under the ocean and even those waves caused by the nukes can&#39;t match the power of a tsunami. Tectonic plates shifting under the ocean is some serious shit! It&#39;s literally an earthquake underwater. And we already know how strong earthquakes on land can be...

“Im scared of the ocean and a forest with a lot of wood”

literally everyone picks up all the acid mushrooms in the beginning.

&quot;Did it just friken exploded!?&quot; -pewds 2020

Yass!

Hello

<a href="">4:07</a> USA cops be like: I took your child, Stop resisting

Yay

Don’t hurt Swedish man in water

Pewdiepie: are there sharks in this game Everyone who played the game before:  no but worse

u need  to make vehicles

<b>gets a bunch of shrooms</b>Pewds: why do I have so many mushrooms?!

I was scared shitless when I first played but hes kinda chill

When he said “are you serious” Siri thought he said hey Siri and popped up on my screen 😂😂

Jack: HEY REEFIESPewds: Eww what is thatJack: =(

Bro fist 😭😭😭

You should go explore near the back of the Aurora.....

Hey bro if u collect scraps of the ship you can turn em into titanium i believe you get 4 per scrap

<a href="">10:07</a>Felix: Are there sharks in this game?Literally 10 seconds later:Felix: <b>gets attacked by a shark</b>

Gaming decade

I got this game cause of you. completed it a few days ago after 84 hours game time over a month. realy REALY good game. thanks felix :)

When you saw the latter h

Can&#39;t wait till he goes in the lava zones, lost river and the jelly shrooms (ik he went in episode 7)

It&#39;s not a Horror Survival Game. It&#39;s a Terror Survival Game.

Dude you have no idea, you got a long way to go

I installed this game and quickly uninstalled it after discovering that I have thalassophobia

Play rain world it’s fun

Derix it may not have sharks but has giant monsters so be careful!

HEY HEY

I am proud to be a senior of the 9 year old army (I’m 11)

Pew: this is titanium<b>*picks up floaters*</b>

Minecraft cave sounds are scarier

Pewds: I think i&#39;m close to beating the game cuz i&#39;ve been playing for a whileEveryone: <b>Should we tell him? No? k</b>

Not procedurally generated, its a standard map. always the same.

What version do you have? EA or the FG

is it a swedish thing because of year walking? (idk if that was really a thing or not)

there some reapers

“PAPYRUS, Where’s Sans?”

Pewdiepie: Is there sharks in this game? Me: <b>laughs in leviathan.</b>

EmBR did it first.

Yo gasopods are the best things in the game ngl

So happy he’s playing subnautica

This game is given me anxiety for no reason

“I’ve been playing for a while think I’m close to beating it”

Just feeding the video more algorithm metrics.

Is he the first one to not be initially terrified of reefbacks?

Felix’s reaction is giving me life 😂

<a href="">2:11</a> why is it not in fire this is so wierd

When he said he thought he was close to beating the the game I laughed Soo hard

Im estonian

This game went from beautiful to disgusting real quick

“ I think I am close to beating it I’ve been playing for a while” yea you are no where near there

It&#39;s a terra game

&quot; I just need a friend and i can stay here forever&quot; Marzia:

But he has played this game before.

(ツ)

Guys he wants 1 mill coments telling him hes wrong lets do that

Cant wait till he faces a leviathian.

<a href="">15:30</a>  - &quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating it&quot; Lmao, sweet child...

Why does every youtuber when they first play this game be like: ACID MUSHROOM? ..... yes

Hi

Pewdiepie:sadly i eat BoomirangMe:I eat puffin

Imagine if this game was VR... 😐

Me waiting for him to see the reaper Leviathan😈😈😈😈

I CAN BEAT THIS GAME IN 3 HOURS!

He discovered that catching fish was a thing a lot faster than I did... For a while, I thought they were just background sprites to make the environment pretty...

Felix: &quot;Ew ,ew, ew! This game is discusting!&quot;1 second later&quot;Look at this, gorgeous.&quot;

What if Pewds is actually Conner McGregor.

“I think I’m close to beating it, because I’ve been playing it for awhile” (Just imagining Jack snickering watching this)

русские есть?)

I completed it yesterday

Subnautica is like 75 irl days long boi

Felix: I&#39;m scared of forests with woodMe: Hmmmm

pewdiepie i love you so much . but you keep getting insecure after you say something and you should be a bhaddie . i’m extremely not sober .

I like how he thought it was an indie game with not much depth and then got so surprised by everything

You never know when you’ll need lubricant pewds-2020

Well ok everyone reading this have a great day and have a nice everything and stay safe

I love subnotica and I hope you do too

Met my first Reaper Leviathan today. It was scary. When I was swimming away I could see its tentacles in front of me and I somehow survived. 😅

OMG GAME

Pewdiepie: I&#39;m Swedish we explode Crashfish: I&#39;m going to end this man&#39;s whole career

Why does everyone do the same things first episode. They just go into the ocean balls-deep without any foreplay. They get scared of the bulbasaur dudes and do a lot of acid.

After not watching PewDiePie for awhile, its nice to know he isn&#39;t loud and obnoxious as he used to be in older videos, no offense lol

From Malaysia ❤

Every single human being who plays Subnautica fills up their entire inventory with acid mushrooms in the beginning

Simp

😁👍

Me looking at Felix, knowing the main plot and end of the Subnautica: <b>Felix:</b> I think I&#39;m close to beating the game.Me: <b>laughs evily</b> You&#39;ll know soon ;)

idk if anyone has suggested this but i would love for you to play bendy.. You playing horror games is my favourite thing on earth

About Fucking Time

It hurts me physically how little he knows about this game

this would be better in vr

I watched EVERY episode of Jack&#39;s series. Thank you, Pewds

IT IS IN FACT A HORRER GAME I WONDER IF HE WILL GET A HEART ATTACK BY THE GHOST LEVIATHANS

Jesus Christ... Pewds atlast you played this shit. It&#39;s like I was waiting for you for years to play this.

i have my best friend, fire extinguisher.... &quot;it is normal to feel lonely after a long time without psychological contact, subject may befriend inanimate objects.&quot;

he should play the titanfall 2 campaign

Love this. Like and sub.

Sorry if I’m a little late but you can get titanium from those metro thing on the ground then turn them into titanium

<b>lmao</b>

He not even close to beat game I’ve been  playing it for a month and I’m still not close

sera que sou o unico pt que acompanha pewDiePie desde a epoca que ele tinha 100k

People who now every thing of this game be like aww shit here we go again

I bet he didn’t even name his mobile vehicle bay dronesLike if you know who Jeffrey, Billy, Samwise and Martial are

FLOOR GANG

Who else is watching this is 2020? Like if you are!!

Damn I wanna pick up the cave sulfur and those metal salvage parts that he didn&#39;t

I was waiting for him to meet the Leviathan lol

HE FOUNF A LEVIATHAN THAT I AHEV BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR AGES HE FOUNF IT IN THE FIRST 2 MIMUTES

It’s so funny watching him do his own thing grabbing hundreds of mushrooms

He this guy is pretty cool. He needs more followers.

где русские субтитры?

The first thing that anyone does when play Subnautica is fill their storage container with acid mushrooms

&quot;I must be close to the end of this game, I&#39;ve been playing for a while.&quot; Little did Felix know this game is about 15 hours long if not more.

YESSSSSSSSS FINALLLYYYYYYY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Action online is copying you lol

“Maybe I should swim closer to the ship.”:)

Pewdiepie: Its so refreshing to play a well made survival game. Pewdiepie three seconds later: This game is Disgusting!!!

Philip DEfranco hearing pews say let&#39;s, <b>aah shit here we go again</b>

Find a cuddle fish and you can make it your buddy

Tip for felix: You can propel your self through water faster if you spray the fire extinguisher behind you while swimming

Pewds says he’s close to finishing it while swimming in the safe shallowsYou poor bastard

Pewds: it seems we don’t have too much storage in hereAlso pewds: fills it mostly with acid mushrooms

Omg pewdiepie second time watching this Series please play subnautica below zero its currently a beta but its really well made still its already near done

We All Know Why He Put That Scuba Mask...B A B Y S H A R K

<a href="">17:26</a>

its funny to think that every subnautica first time players fills their inventory with acid mushrooms (including me)

Anyone play this game on Ps4?

Felix has already embraced his inner subnautica player by dancing to the music during a time when you really should be trying to stay alive

Pewds please make a series out of this

Jacksepticeye: recommends Subnautica to Pewds: Jacksepticeye watching him play&quot;What in the Non-Subnautica god f*** is this s***&quot;

Subnutica isn&#39;t a horror game it a survival game

Forest with a lot of woods and ocean are scary? next game is green hell i guess

Play journey to the Savage planet

Grabs floaters: “these are definitely titanium” lol

Sharks are the least of ur worries in this game

You Should Try No Man&#39;s Sky Beyond its an open universe Adventure Game you can Find Earth Like Planet visit planets you can explore Them, some time there are planets who can give you gusbumps Alart Felix Don&#39;t Be scare when you visiting a Ghost Planet or toxic planets, you can Build Base on any planet Like minecraft, you can fight online player if they pop up on your planet or on the galexy, So Many Ships Infinity Planets infinity galexy, and mainly all animals are creepy, last time a peranaha look like gaint fist eat me, its an awesome game to you should trythird person view and first person view you can play in any one
