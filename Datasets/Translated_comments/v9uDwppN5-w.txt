Satan is not allowed to talk to shawnda. Shawnda sounds like the name of a person.

I’m not a demon. But I want satan to be murdered more than I was. I want him to suffer the way he thinks people should suffer for him. And I don’t want anyone to suffer for satan.

I don’t like the way the singer looks but the song is ok.

I can't get enough of this song. I love!
Who’s here october 2022

Not many of their songs were charted on Hot 100&#39;s top 10, but trust me, Demi&#39;s songs are the worldwide biggest hits!!!!

<a href="">3:27</a>

And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. 

When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 

And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 

Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. 

And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. 

He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, They will respect my son.

But those tenants said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.

And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. 

What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. 

Mark 12:1-9 ESV

It sounds so similar to dynamite

I love her voice 
Neon lights! 
Imagine being so gorgeous, blessed in so many ways and you just fuck it up. I miss the old demi, I miss demi and Selena&#39;s friendship so much

Never gets old

Hold up. Did I just see an apple watch? They had those 8 years ago? Apparently I&#39;ve been living under a rock or she predicted the future...

08/28/22 listening because I love it 
These terrorists Lukini, Shainurovi, Ahmatnurovi from Perm, Mitini from Moscow,  Ahmetov from Alicante, Zenkovi from Perm, Morozovi from Moscow, their band stole digital copy of my body and my voice for making easy movies and songs to feed their terrorists group. Never publish their movies with  heads of their team members attached to my body. I never gave them any right to use digital copy of my body and my voice for making their movies or music. They must be in jaiL. I want them to get exradition....

The RaptureFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.Deuteronomy 30:19 R.MWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

I&#39;m sorry

A copy of “Be the one” Neyo 2012.

I love the track would loved to see the dancers shuffling with all the neon all over them would looked gold . My daughter and a few of her friends came through that dance era . Actually think it would have suited the dance track too. But hey I&#39;m just one woman in the whole world full of great ideas .

This song is the best :) (G28) <a href="">

I like demi she has a high voice

Seriously do you have anything better to do? I am here for your amusement. Hopefully, you all got through! I get to go home ALONE thank God...:) Let me go and don&#39;t ask for anything else that isn&#39;t given to every regular Joe

I didn't need to leave POP, I could have kept both, POP and ROCK.
Wow amazing Party song!️
awesome                                   sings

Missing Demi&#39;s song like this 

<b>this song was part of my childhood and I miss it so much</b>

2013, 2014 and 2015, without a doubt those were the best years of my life, including little stories about how you are in my life️, I can't wait to go back in time ️
Anyone else in the middle of 2022?

I love my queen so much ️️️️
I'm going to buy something to give myself pleasure
I don't know what affection is. I've never had someone to teach me what affection is. When I'm very sick with depression, I lock myself up for my safety so as not to hurt myself. I listen to your music and it calms me down. I swear. I can endure the sentence for loving whoever I want, I endure blows, I endure everything and I don't care about being beaten and pigeons, I am satisfied with having hope. I swear to you that I am going to hurt all of my lovato and that enough of enduring being hit is enough. Enough of putting up with homophobia because you like different things, I don't care what gender you are, it doesn't matter if you're a girl, boy or trans, it doesn't matter, we all have the same right to love and be loved and I hope there is a girl or boy or whatever. find and want to know me and whatever arises I have hope of finding someone who will teach me what affection and tenderness is duty it is sad that a young girl like me is alone but I am against everything now no one stops me and I go for We are all too old to endure, we are all equal and we have the right to love and if I want to kiss a girl on the mouth I do it or else I take my pleasure into my own hands.
Your songs relax me and boy I'm going to give up alcohol I know I can do it and I'm going to do it for you demi lovato you are my hope
I love Demi Lovato's songs, thanks to her I was able to come out of the closet this year and I listen to the songs all day and if they gave me the choice of who my favorite singer is, it is Deli Lovato, my favorite, she is the only singer that I really love. that demi lovato seems to be a good person and I thank demi for having released the song cool for the summer if she reads it I want to tell her that she is a wonderful person and that thank you for helping me if moving counts if you knew demi lovato that when I told my mother that I am pansesual and apart from that I don't feel like a woman or a man. Did you know what she hit me? She hit me with a bruise on my ribs and she beat me up but I dealt with her as best I could. the summer and I faced her and if I had had a girl to kiss her in front of my mother I would have done it but I didn't have anyone I swear to you demi lovato that you have changed my life I won't have anyone from my family but I can have it I like it, it doesn't matter what gender it is, I swear that if I had someone who would give me a hug, I might cry, but well, it's sad that a 20-year-old girl like me is alone without a job, she's a family with no one who can tell her, you need a hug demi lovato and I fell into a depression with anxiety and neon a lot of alcohol and at night I don't sleep because of the anxiety and depression because it makes me tingly and I collapse and cry without anyone to give me a hug and comfort me No one looks at me and the truth is that when I manage to sleep is when I listen to your songs that relax me. The truth is that I drink to not feel pain but the worst thing is that I don't have any friends. It's the worst of all but thanks to you I'm happy. thanks to your joy thanks to your beauty and thanks to your music I can put my mind blank and let myself sleep thank you for being a wonderful person I don't know how to repay you how grateful I am to you for changing my life and teaching me that when there are storms it comes calm down I think I know how to thank you I'm going to tell you a surprise I'm going to stop drinking alcohol and I hope you read it demi lovato I'm going to do it for you if I were your friend I'm sure we would be close, loyal friends who don't say confidential things I would like to one day be able to go to one of your concerts one day  from me
still vibin&#39; 2022 ️

Hi Demi

was so obsessed with this omg i’m so glad i remembered this

I just watched CLEAR BANDIT (SOLO)...AND I STILL LIKE IT A LOT...
Soon this song will become a rage on Tiktok, take note.
i remembered how my 7 years old ass got into emergency room cause of the liquid inside the glow in the dark sticks, i secretly bought a lot of it then i put it all over my body, my lips and i accidentally swallowed it causing for me to have a hard time breathing and after it, this song is prohibited to play in our house 

9:08 PM

Whose here in 2022

This brings me back to the eighth grade (2013-2014 school year).

Hi Demi xoxoxo

Love you always Demi! I remember listening to most of your songs while I was in middle school through high school. You still rock! 

Such a good song.  I have Demi&#39;s book about staying strong.

so who&#39;s still here :)

this beat&#39;s always running in my head.

Hope this song gets viral too

WITHOUT A DOUBT, SHE IS A QUEEN OF POP 
I love it 
How nostalgic
Hello 2022 
anyone remember the floating away from your bullshit meme, right after she posted this video? Iconic.

I love Demi Lovato
You can tell Demi wasn&#39;t feeling confident with her body in this video. She doesn&#39;t dance or show below her waist. Just in that dark silhouette shot. I wish I knew this before so I could leave a message to encourage her. Sorry Demi.

I was 14 years old when this song was released, it's from my teenage years, I love it. Demi Lovato sings a lot of slk, very ballad, high spirits, damn this clip. I keep listening as if for the first time 
Joao Pedro Estranho
I love demi&#39;s blue hair! And neon makeups on point!

This is my jam

2013: “this song is so beautiful”2014: “this song is so beautiful”2015: “this song is so beautiful”2016: “this song is so beautiful”2017: “this song is so beautiful”2018: “this song is so beautiful”2019: “this song is so beautiful”2020: “this song is so beautiful”2021: “this song is so beautiful”2022: “this song is so beautiful”

Jesus Christ SavesJesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.Biblical References:1. Romans 5:92. Romans 3:233. Romans 6:234. Romans 10:95.
