A lapse in my judgement while checking out ripped off sequences by Bollywood on the internet. Want to apologise to Apoorv, also known as @thatonedumbkidd on Instagram that originally created the comparative edit between Dabangg and 500 Days Of Summer. You can follow him here:<a href=""> internet is a scary place where the original author of inventive edits with so much circulation gets lost in the void. My apologies to him again. Check him out, he posts some dope film content on Instagram!

Make a video on Nayak the way anil kapoor creepily chases Rani in the beginning.

Ranjeet, Prem Chopra, Shakti Kapoor and many more villains made a fortune out of their hideous roles.

AGHHHHHThis trope of men dressing up as women to get into women-only places is sooo toxic. It just supports the stereotype that trans women are perverted men looking to assault women, and makes cis women paranoid and transphobic for NO reason. Trans women being cis men looking to assault women is NOT a thing. Trans people are legitimately transgender, and deserve to be treated with sensitivity in view of the pain they suffer every day at the hands of our society.I swear to god, it pisses me off when creators make this shit and market it as the supreme example of comedy when it&#39;s just plain insensitive toward women, and even in women, specifically targets trans women and alienates them even more in society. You&#39;re making cis women paranoid toward INNOCENT people. Seriously. Have some sensitivity toward marginalised communities. And, I do understand that Tahalka and Remo are not recent movies. However, we still have films like Laxmii, and Akshay Kumar was even given an award for his performance in that movie.I&#39;m not a trans person and it definitely is much more the right of trans people to call this shit out rather than me. However, even from the perspective of someone who has never suffered the issues specific to trans people (dysphoria, misgendering, etc.) I can tell the effect media like this has on such a terrorised community.Filmmakers, PLEASE make more responsible choices! Please, PLEASE do better. We need better from you.

I really like to mention here to Jammy ...u had picked up to watch the movie himmat aur mehnat...it goes so rightly to you for actually having Himmat to watch such movies and Mehnat to make the videos for us to watch...really maan respect for you and I always love to watch the videos and make sure I hear word to word of what u say...mind blowing research by you boy...hard work ..I mean lots of hard work ya...keep it up and going dude..

Every movie of rajnikanth

Fuck they ripped off 500 days of summer in Dabang 

&quot;500 days of summer&quot; is my all time favourite love story though it&#39;s not a love story..

Jeetendra movies are torture
Kashmiri women know how Tehlka was not that shocking

David dhawan&#39;s movies always have &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39; scene

i domt get why rrajkumar is good yes its catchy but the lyrics literally are&quot;tera picha kru to rokne ka nai&quot;how was this approved?

Even fictional stories comes with responsibility....

I wonder how much difficulty and cringe you got through watching all these movies just to make one video hats off 

Lekin cricket match ka score kya hain?

<a href="">2:47</a> wtf <a href="">8:25</a> What a father People actually had seen this movie in theatre 
And the girl is Urvashi Dholakia

In <a href="">2:29</a> in that movie they are making fun of indian army as well as Hinduism. As they are mentioning ganga snan and yamuna snan in a cheap manner where these words are holy and considered as mother river in Hinduism. This bollywood and tukre tukre gang always try to harm image of india and Hinduism. Like nasiruddin shah here doing the same. Such a shameless people they are.

Thanks for the intro 

I got this video recommended after his interview with Kangana 

Your ending statement with that scene. We try to act “woke” when in reality all we are doing is, engaging in cyber bullying unnecessarily blaming the wrong party and blatantly ignoring what is happening locally, lord save us from each other

You&#39;re brilliant!

The best part about T and R is it that it always hits the bull&#39;s eye.. Jammy is  a very intellectual person.

A person almost dies in firepolice office: &quot;...I have passed the fire test and have passed the fire test...&quot;
<a href="">2:30</a> them dressing up as women to make the most out of their creepy antics also in a way harms the transgender community. yk, conservatives who are against trans people and their rights as any other human beings love to use this argument which goes &quot;Trans-women shouldn&#39;t be allowed in the womens&#39; bathroom because there will be men who will use this opportunity to dress up as trans and try to assault women&quot; bullshit. If the western countries use this argument, then think of our oh so great conservative india. The more i watch your videos the more I realize how normalized these problems have become because of media potrayal. matlab kuch bhi?????

Shahid Kapur is my fav actor he is my crush but R..Rajkumar is yak &amp; Horrible movie it&#39;s really unbeatable movie it&#39;s a embrassing movie.

The makers didn&#39;t create bizarre and stupid scenes for that time.. It was all common back then. Please understand that the society itself was quite misogynist and shallow, so audiences also enjoyed these scenes at times.

Yaar ye Hollywood wale apne selmon bhoi ko copy karna kab band karenge yaar. Kuch toh apana original karo.

This is so sad And shame!!, that such movies are made

I know a blind fan who loves r rajkumar

Bro i was really analysing and feeling the same way about some bizarre movies n scenes from childhood feeling wierd n angry, giving  such bad msgs to society. Happy to see bro like u acknowledging society about stupid movies.

3/5 movies were before 2000 and our parents totally tell us the opposite abt the films then.

this just so horrible Victim  married to his abuser and  now he  now he can rape her for her entrie life legally with no punishment .

But the first tahaka scene is truth. In army woman’s aren’t welcome openly. There aren’t many woman in army coz there’s a lot chance of sexual assault even with men too.

Bollywood is disgusting. Leaving a few movies, everything is crap

Gandi Baat is Shahid&#39;s worst song. Ive been eve teased to this song so many times, its awful. im sure other girls have faced the same. actors in this day and age should be more responsible with what theyre telling the world cause they have a big fan following and influence

You need to be more un biased in reviewing

Tahalka needs to be banned

Your patience is commendable. To watch these movies is a project in itself. As always, great analysis video.

Nowadays I can&#39;t take sexist and racist jokes to that extent that if a soap opera shows Abala naari, i get frustrated.

Himmat and Mehnat is a good title actually, too bad it doesn&#39;t live up to it

kitni tuff english bolte ho...i keep switching between your vedio and google , btw i like your voice n command on language

Wow.. I would rather thank you and pray that your messages reach masses.. You are doing justice to the social evils that get pampered by this bollywood..

There is really no substitute for the word &quot;problematic&quot;. It fully sums up what these movies/plots/dialogues/scenes are.

Who are the writers and producers for these films?! They&#39;re the patient 0

Please make a play list of matlab kuch bhi videos.

When mineta is a pervEveryone: <b>hates him</b>When the characters in these movies are pervsMany people: <b>still like them</b>??

can you do one with homophobia in Bollywood? You would get like 10 parts to it...And they still have not given up on it and treat it as comedy. As if it is normal and society should applaud them for it.

Kabir singh was good it showed how being in a way destroys everything you have .

In my all life I watched only around 20 Bollywood movies just because I don&#39;t want this kuda to get into my brain. Even as a 10-year-old kid I knew how wrong all of this is.

&quot;Make you cringe to the core&quot; - definitely felt that -_-

I think Supreme Court fond of Bollywood drama so much dat they tried to  bring some plot in judiciary. Cji of sc asked rapist to marry victim so crime lol be spared

My soul is disgusted with Javed in Tehelka

I&#39;m hooked up with this channel . Amazing videos

cinema has big impact in our mindset while growing up to grown up thats why flim industry has to be responsible

What a quantity???wtf?? just Ew
Luv u jammy u r doing great
Saw the intro and immediately liked the video!! So creative 

Isn&#39;t Rascals a Remake of another movie ?

Indian filmakers would be like us as highschoolers getting into creative discussion when handed with school dramas and skits....make the audience laugh even if the concept or logic is literally fucked..... But we did better compared to all those money poured into the project.... Wtf do they think making those out of place slapstick comedies and plotless  movies....

Ur voice is 
himmat aur mehnat to phir bi 1987 me tha abi ke serials me ajj tk yehi ho rha....there is one in colours &quot;molki&quot; the lead actress sister chooses to marry her abuser that was also lead actor&#39;s brother...he had raped her, after knowing all this not the villagers or family but she said that as a punishment she will marry him...m like wht is this? maybe she swore to herself to make his life a living hell or smthing like that...but seriously this is so toxic...

Why offence at Millitary men? Are they not human? Why treat them like Gods? Respecting our protectors is one thing and acting to level of dictatorship is another.

Fuckkk,the last one is made my blood boil.No wonder the janta is so tharki and regressed

Jammy bro, long time subscriber from Canada. You post amazing content but I have a humble suggestion. Please change your intro music. It&#39;s too loud relative to the rest of your content. So, I find myself turning it down and tuning it up every time. Cheers bro.

Himmat aur mehanat was a real crap movie.

Someone should talk about raani mukharji&#39;s first film where court ordered her to marry her rapist and next scene she is shown dreaming of dancing on her wedding day with her rapist

The rascals said mast style and enjoyed the fun.
Waise Cricket ka score Kitna h........

Depressing !

The way we copy from other industries 

kangana ranaut is no more innocent

Why your subtitles are so misspelled.. Ya fir jaanbujhkr

And now we have cooli number 1 sequel which is worsen than anything, In 2020 nothing changed much for bollywood they are just supporting sexism and harassment.

<a href="">6:03</a> ayyo ayyayo ayyo. ...
Just like a scene from r..rajkumar there is a scene in  sillendru oru kadhal where the girl is standing in the middle of the road and truck is approaching her .surya tries to save her and in the process he tore her cloth and after that incident she falls for him by saying she is angry because he was only  supposed to see her body and not for the public and there are more harassing scenes which makes us question how did she fall for him .matlab kuch bhi

When Sheldon Cooper gets all political <a href="">

U must be a good person.

Random click..pr mast tha brother...
Why is nobody talking about the shitty movie Raja ki aayegi baraat it&#39;s just pathetic that&#39;s it.

You should also include BENASM BADSHA starring Anil kapoor and Juhi chawla in lead role

<b>Ending</b> of the video concludes it all in the end.

Rascals was the movie i have been waiting for TRP to finally include &amp; talk about in &quot;Kuch bhi&quot; .. and he finally did. 

Kangna  ..she sleeps with anyone

Wow man it&#39;s was amazing

I noticed one fight scene in kick movie is directly copied from Ironman 2&#39;s Scarlett Johansson scene

Which video did you talk about tahalkas villain Amrish puri?

You know what ; I really Appreciate &amp; Respect this ...

Hollywood and Tollywood rocks!! 

What about movie mehndi staring Rani Mukherjee?
Bahu? Which bahu? The one they raped and then tried to burn? How could they even try to get that girl married to that rapist and murderer? 

He rapes her and then lectures her and slaps her only to marry her the next day?! Why isn&#39;t she going to the cops or atleast running away from him? Why is the man not in jail yet? Matlab kuch bhi is an understatement! 

so isnt kangana the actress who is always mouthing off about doing feminist movies

Now we know why India is most unsafe country for women.

This is unfortunately, just 5 in over a thousand embarrassing moments in Indian films

<a href="">

I bet your next MKB episode on new cringe movie CoolieNo1

There r people in this country who have seen Breaking Bad and didn&#39;t like it, so u know I think debate should end now.

Now I realized that Bollywood has been worst since those old days

<a href="">

<a href="">9:10</a> have seen this just in memes and fb videos  jammy only you knows from which movie this scene was

But Tejaswini was a huge hit in Telugu film industry

Loving your intros lately
Trivia:-The girl at <a href="">8:54</a> is Urvashi Dholakia.

Kangana inner hate comes from the experiences on working on those sets like rascals, which she said  she did  just for money

R rajkumar&#39;s musicis my favourite too. But but but lyrics of its song gandi bat are problematic. Ya its music and dance make it so famous party song that we enjoy it forgetting the misogynestic lyrics but these are problematic too

LaxmiiBomb also said &quot;Agar mere saamne aa bhoot aa jaye too maa kasam kam chidiya pehen lunga&quot;
So censor board was having drugs that time and is now having the bad after effects of it , and cannot come out of it even till today. Lol censor board pls censor the directors before they come up with audio visual nuclear bomb and give us all a never ending painful radiation lasting with it for years by loosing our brain senses , cognitive abilities and permanent deaf and blindness.

Pls don&#39;t judge 1970s in 2020s...the bar of social equality and morality at that time was way less

I have seen atleast 3 memes from the scenes in this video in 2 days. Memers are watching Jammy&#39;s video and making memes out of his content.

Its cringe not creep ..

What is the intro music?

Bro why are you so anti- bollywood? You always project it as a pothole and promote the idea that one should stop watching it. I agree there are many negative aspects of it but you should also make videos on its positive sides too..

Intro was lit

These movies are shit. But i am not offended.

Score kya hua btw?
That &#39;Le public&#39; tag at the end though 

Rascals was a headache and was also very regressive! I don&#39;t know Tejasvini movie would be even 4 steps ahead

Bollywood should have grown by now and should have started making good quality movies which are more logical and more sensible. Bollywood now have enough resources and talent which shouldn&#39;t be wasted on masala movies.Take an example of time travel movies. Hollywood made a perfect time travel movie trilogy in the 1970s (Back to the future). In the name of time travel movies, we have shitty movies like Action Replay and Baar Baar Dekho.

Thank you for making such content 
I rewatched this film just to understand how bad it truly is . Made my day

Whoa !

The movies you need to watch just to make videos. 
You&#39;re about to hit 1M, keep going Jammy! 
Sorry  to say this but Literature is reflection of society..

The way u form u op ion not just state as soon as it’s trending but take ur time is beautiful to watch We all have such reservations n we take our time n m glad u do introspect while some ppl take it so personally that they spend all of their energy to prove that their initial thought was right, the ego issue, I have that huge n to see u so beautifully discuss it with encourages me 

Please watch Five feet apartIt&#39;s really a good movie

David Dhawan has just lost it. He should retire now. Just launched coolie no.1 trailer yesterday. It is huge money spending garbage film to salvage son&#39;s career. Nobody should watch films like these.

Jammy you are forgetting diolgues said by villians and side characters are not taken serious by Indian public you can see how cruel munna bhayia character but people loves divayandu and hates munna I literally shouted when munna died so, please add only the scenes where protoganists bizarre actions

R...Rajkumar ripped all the bizarre scenes from south Indian movies and unfortunately This is the last movie of legendary telugu actor Srihari

looks like you make your videos making fun of Indian movies..but you have to let people know that all this is ur opinion and ur way of looking at the movie

Tejasvini is really disturbing story.. there is a long long list of sexual assult and it&#39;s all being justified over one wants to marry the girl. Further more we live in a society where girl&#39;s personal sexual life is connected with her respect in the society and the ultimate respectful thing family wants is girl to get married. Where in real marriage was supposed to be a union of two people who respect, love and want to live together forever marriage seems like a scam of possession over an individual whole identity, and unfortunately it&#39;s very true in India.Raja ki aayege baraatMehndiCinema has long list of dramas and movies which teach&#39;s a girl that she is a property and needs an owner to it.

Urvashi Dholakia @ <a href="">08:54</a>
The running theme in most of 90&#39;s movies. A girl gets Sexually Assualted. Get her married to the person who assaulted her b&#39;cos her virginity could only belong to one man and if not the assualter then who else would take responsibility for her?? Forget that she is educated, forget that she is working woman, forget that she is self sufficiently independent woman who can very well support herself. Baad mein jaye logic. If she cannot get married to her rapist then her second best option is to die or commit suicide.

When do you sleep jammy?

Waiting  for review on Middle Class Melodies on prime video

Ek time pe apne parents yein movies dekh te the.... Can&#39;t belive this

For sanjay dutt it was okay...But for ajay...he told in his interview that he regret doing rascals

<a href="">3:00</a> movie name?
Why is complementing someone as &quot;most beautiful flower&quot; problematic?? Genuinely asking this.

<a href="">6:08</a> Sheldon 
you&#39;re going to achive 1min soon 

Wo sab to theek h bhai lekin,CRICKET KA SCORE KYA HAI ?!!!

Indian movies or Hindi movies  ?????
You can make a whole 30 minutes video on Jism ki garmi therapy invented by bollywood

He had us at the intro 

Once a wise man said, &quot;What is this? What is this? For what, why?&quot;

The starting was sooo bosss

I would say shekhar suman is legend...

If you start exploring Telugu and Tamil cinema, I am sure you will get triple the content of Bollywood in &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot; series.

Anmol bhai why do you watch so many movies?
jammy hates kangana still he use her picture in every other videos LoL

&quot;The thought of marrying your abuser&quot;Baby have you ever heard of stockholm syndrome?

Wo line yaad hai- &quot;jab tak is desh me cinema h, customer C* banta rahega&quot;Rather it should be- &quot;jab tak public C* hai, cinema aise hi chalta rahega&quot;

Alt title: cringe lvl 100 scenes in Bollywood

The Kangana we know now..... Is never going to do movies like Rascals....... That was a desperate time

We would love to see you do a matlab kuch bhi video on some music videos of bollywood. 

Salmon be like &#39; Who knows what will happen?
Your concept of consent is a bad joke.

Hey guys please do check out the videos of mine

Bro..HelloWatch VADACHENNAI alsoAfter I saw the zero cuts thumbnailed video, i suggest u to watch thatU may find similaritiesThank you

Tahalaka was better than Uri...

no plz
the intro !

This guys will get more than million followers or maybe more rham ten million

Thx...the classic, you watched again to see how bad it really is

These constantly remind me why I had such effed up views on issues like rape as a child.

Ye to meine jitni bhi Bollywood movies dekhin hain agar usmein kisi ka rape hota hai to us ladki ki shaadi uss abuser se hi kawadete hain ye to bhut common hai Bollywood movies main

<a href="">6:04</a> Kinda same plot of Rani Mukherjee's Raja ki Ayegi Baraat.
Love these videos. There should be more matlab kuchh bhi

You will get same content by David Dhawan even after 10 years.

Javed Jeffery was very much excited at the beginning of the scene.

Wow Dabangg is so original.

That Tejasvini scene was so cringe like WTF

Did you not review Welcome Home movie in SonyLiv app?

Why do u and I connect so well maaaannnnn I always thought about tejaswini it&#39;s the most stupidest film and now this video pops up

It&#39;s just whorefic

Nani hoga. Sir.

Ur bolllywod critic, OK guts if u have shown laxmi bomb collection.

You are absolutely right bro. Every thing cannot be accepted under the cover of art. How can the characters like this be called heros. Real shame.

What the fucking fuck did I just watch

11/10 for the intro

11/10 for the intro

Haunting bhaiya zindabad
no pls
Review banshee please its the most underrated show ever

@tried&amp;refusedproductions, a page on fb caled &#39;PostOast&#39; ihas recently copied your video into an article of &#39;8 times replacement happened in bollywood because of weird reasons&#39;. Do check that!         That post was also shared by &#39;The BACK Benchers&#39; page. It&#39;s a total rip-off of your research.

Ok

Anmol bhai, need to contact you. Pls provide your email ID.  Some feedback about few movies to be discussed

I remember calling Rascals a bizzare and senseless comedy when I was 14, that time my friends ridiculed me for not understanding comedy. Now I feel sorry for them and also am glad my parents taught me to differentiate between right and wrong at that young age.

Sad thing is david dhawan is still making these type of regressive  comedy

The intros are getting better and better everytime.

I am here to take English lessons as well 

Can you recommend a good horror movie???

I agree rascals was cringy

I&#39;m in love with this new intro

I fount out instagram store...named trendy_new_collectionThey provide free delivery nd COD Check out

You did not mention Jaani Dushman

Dishonorable mention: that jaani Dushman scene where manishas character gets raped and others normalise itEdit: dishonorable, not honorable mention.

I am keeping a count of all the months spent in lockdown with all the &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot; episodes that Jammy is releasing.

After evey&quot;Matlab Kuch bhi&quot; Episode, I feel &quot;What the fuck&quot; But the last film of this episode  literally made me nauseous

I am preparing for GRE and TOEFL. That&#39;s why I come here and note down the words you use. Thank you jammy pant sir.

I sometimes feel the anixiouness for the actors who are amazing but never get any work because of the buffonary in Bollywood and eventually they leave the acting world and we never get to see that Amazing potential.

These movies unfortunately have contributed to the rape cases to this day. Producers and directors have to come out and apologize for these movies and scenes which encourage domestic abuse, sexual molestation and rape

Petition for a matlab kuch bhi <b>Playlist</b> !!!! It&#39;s will help to re-watch this gems again... please..

intro and exit was lit 

That girl from Tejaswini became Komolika later. Just saying  she would&#39;ve suitably treated that creep

Bhai plz make review on three(moonu) movie

This guy asked what is the score of cricket?
Another hilarious video. Although, why did you censor the word &quot;rape&quot; in your video?

Naseeruddin shah and jawed jaafri in those roles  omg!

That wasn&#39;t Sridevi&#39;s voice was it?

I know a scene you can add to thisTheres a malayalam movie called Mr Marumakan, the movie is totally a bigOffensive pile of shitBut there&#39;s  a scene in which the villian character employs a guy to rape the hero&#39;s sister but hero catches him and makes him rape the villian character&#39;s  sister. These are added in for laughs that&#39;sYou can find this scene on youtube

Bro..have a look at andhagaram on Netflix ...

Please watch Hellaro.The best Indian movie of 2019 in my opinion.

Please review Sony LIV horror film welcome home 

Hindi me dekhta hai to hindi me hi video bna na
Why no one is talking about delhi crime winning international Emmy award for the best drama series 

Intro is really cool.

Hilarious! It was and will be MADNESS in some Bollywood Movies.Have you made any episode with the trend of Bollywood screwing up classic KOREAN Movies by remaking them  like Aishwarya Rai&#39;s JAZBAA, Sanjay Dutt&#39;s ZINDA, Amitabh Bachchan&#39;s T3EN, Randeep Hooda&#39;s MURDER 2 and god save the upcoming Kartik Aaryan&#39;s DHAMAKA!

This was so deeply disturbing to me. Such perverts are making movies in the name of film makers. It’s sad. Kudos to you to bringing it out.

This is the reason why I don’t watch Bollywood movies now..everything is copied ..songs...dance..dialogues..story everything..I like Malayalam movie

Anmol bhai...I&#39;m not your fan because your content is amazing (which it consistently is) but I am your fan because you accept criticism in such a beautiful way bro. And you are sooooo humble. Tu bohot aage jaana chahiye, na bhi jaaye to is sukoon se marna ki tu bohot sahi insaan hai.

What does MAT LUB KUCH BHI mean???? I have been trying to figure that out.

The fact that this ep is preluded by a scene from that infamous 500 Days of Summer (even though fir totally different reason) In which it entails of the obsession the male protagonist has for his counterpart... In later interviews and even on Twitter to an observation from a fan, Gordon-Levitt repeatedly warned against sympathizing with his character Tom, who &quot;develops a mildly delusional obsession over a girl onto whom he projects all these fantasies [...] That’s falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person.&quot; Levitt has made it evidently clear that in fact Tom was the actual villain and not Summer. The fact that this movie scene was used for this creep ep is truly chilling. Coincidence? Or not...

i feel so dumb sometimes for actually enjoying r rajkumar unironically. i need to re-evaluate my whole life

Had to like the video in the first 20 seconds 

Aye haye rascals was the worst movie ever 

At <a href="">1:59</a> spelling mistake of name amrish puri to amdish puri

bro can you talk about varun dhawan like i know people now are not liking him and tell he is not a good  actor(overacting and stuff) but he has done movies like badlapur and october but those movies earned very less and we all run to thratres when one of his overacting kmovies come to theatre like judwaa 2

I am afraid that one day we will lose our dearest Anmol to these &#39;Matlab kuch bhi&#39; episodes, he revisits such horrible content only for us, our brave hero Anmol  

Imagine watching Rascals at a movie theatre... I did. With my entire family. Ofc we didn&#39;t know what kind of movie it was. It was the only movie at the theatre and we were very bored so we went to watch it without reading any reviews. The awkwardness after the movie was done was unreal!

Nice video Jammy. Entertaining ones 

Some of these scenes are so sad, especially the ones involving the assault victims, that it physically hurts to watch. I wonder how can anyone even think that it is even slightly okay?

The jaw dropping &#39;kuch bhi&#39; moment intro  and might I say the best one yet.

Digress is one of his Favourite repetitive word.

Bp high hogaya ye dekh kay jammy bhai. What even!!! Disgusting to the core thank for saying out all this out loud

I don&#39;t like Salman but Salman se mast jalti hai teri, just like 1000s of other ppl coz he still makes money even after doing shitty acting, movie and remakes

&quot;Le Public&quot; 
“Balatkar” or “izzat lutna” was such a common thread in the 90s. How sensibilities have changed in 30 years!

Have you watched October?!! It&#39;s a bollywood film and features . It&#39;s a main theme is love all in all, and it does not included all the bollywood masala. Please do watch and tell me what you feel, please!!!!! 

I think you should make a separate  video on &quot; jism ki garmi deni hogi&quot; . according to copywood if a woman is wet or she has cold then  jism ki garmi is very essential for her .I think jism ki garmi is panacea , ye saale indirectly rape ko promote kr rhe hain

In R rajkumar there is a song   &quot;ab krunga tere saath  gandi baat &quot; if she is not accepting my proposal then I have right to do &quot; gandi baat &quot; saala gaana sun k kaan m harpik daal le aadmi . I think you should have included whole  Judwa 2 because Judwa 2 (Judwa ki sasti copy) is nothing but a creep and hazardous movie I have ever seen. If you make a list of &#39; mtlb kuchh bhi episode &quot; then most of govinda and dhawan&#39;s movies will be there .Tapsi in thappad movie :-  thappad nhi maar skta Tapsi in judwa 2 ( masala movie) :- varun tapsi k back pe thappad maarta h or baad m dono ki setting ho gai , is se Hume seekh milti h ki actors ko actors hi smjho bhagwan  ya ideal nhi ye log khud apni baat ko glt saabit kr dete hain

That parallel between Dabangg and 500 Days is so uncanny!

I remember watching Tejasvini when i was like 12/13 and being from a conservative I knew nothing about the guy was doing to the woman. But I still felt sick to my stomach and had a feeling that it was something bad and it shouldn&#39;t happen.

I can&#39;t even imagine how do directors narrate this kind of shit to the male and female lead.

You should use the initials - &#39;Tried &amp; Confused Productions&#39; when you make the &#39;Matlab Kuchh Bhi&#39; Videos.

Earlier, Rajkumar had watched a movie for the first time in his life without any reason but now I thought what I had watched.
Was it censor board then?

Somebody remind Kangana of Rascals next time she lectures about mediocrity in Bollywood!

Boycott this channel for showing our National Patriot - Kangana ji in an embarrassing scene... Jammy Mulla..

Where can i watch 500 days of summer ???

Hit like for &quot;What a Quantity&quot; 

I think you need to make a separate video on Mithon&#39;s 90&#39;s filmography you&#39;ll be too shocked to even &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi?!!&quot; even.

Jammy you&#39;ve gotta give credit for the intro to theonedumbkiddEdit : Ok already done. Noice

Watch public sex scene of Hollywood movie &quot;Crank 2&quot;, you will forget all &quot;matlab kudh bhi&quot; scenes. The cringe in that scene is at another level but that won&#39;t be criticized because that is Hollywood.

Dabangg won 2011 Filmfare for best movie award 
what intrigues me is that kangana ranaut was endorsing such problem content in films like double dhamaal and rascal and today she is talking about gender equality and feminism.a hypocrite by all means

Anmol..Please make a &quot;matlab kuch bhi &quot; episode on the creepiness of 80s hindi remakes of southern movies..You will get a lot of creepy content there.

Why dont you make a matlab kuch bhi on wolf of wall street. If you and the entire indian audience think this is all sexist, I wonder what would happen to all of you once you watch Wolf Of Wall Street 

With that intro you earn 1000 subs 

Funny how you are embarrassed of Bollywood lifting scenes from other movies and then go on to do the same with your intro. Hypocrite.

@triedandrefused .... Please do a show on durgamati..... But watch bhagamathie first and then on the trailer

A lapse in my judgement while checking out ripped off sequences by Bollywood on the internet. Want to apologise to Apoorv, also known as @thatonedumbkidd on Instagram that originally created the comparative edit between Dabangg and 500 Days Of Summer. You can follow him here:<a href=""> internet is a scary place where the original author of inventive edits with so much circulation gets lost in the void. My apologies to him again. Check him out, he posts some dope film content on Instagram!

<a href="">2:40</a> is the stuff of nightmares ️

You inspire to start something of my own....Btw watched around 30+ movies across languages and genre based on your reviews...️️️

I feel abused after watching this video 

Urs intro is getting better day by day 
I find some sort of manipulation and wickedness in this video. Disapproved of this video . Also matlab kuchh bhi episodes should atleast aim at aimiciable humour, this episode was far from being funny and even the messaging is of mearge quality. The video comes across as carefully edited lies and for some reason feels far from the free world, feels like Anmol&#39;s voice is no more making love to words. Honestly do away with such stuff where your mind is with fear and that you cannot even think and feel freely.

I was expecting you would mention about Sonakshi Sinha&#39;s character as well in AJ where she believes in good luck by looking at Ajay Devgan&#39;s balls. 

Tahalka was a documentary 

Brother, I have seen the video...But what is the SCORE?
Jammy man you&#39;ve been ssly working upon cool intros, keep it up mann

Anmol, I have one question: &quot;How do you make yourself sit through these movies, do you have some prep or a ritual?&quot;

&quot;Daughter I read the movie&quot;Bas Bihari movie, please don't be the judge of the society.
I just watched 500 Days of Summer today afternoon and seeing this intro was just delightful.

Yeah! Actors portray as Army Officers, but can&#39;t even have a proper Military Hair Cut.

<b>Now a days whenever I saw Republic TV, I remember MATLAB kuch b</b> 

Creepy content from 60’s to 80’s

David dhawan is one shit in Bollywood.

Ala Vaikuntapuramulo movie also has some cons.. if you watch it sensefully..

I think people should be penalized to make such crappy movies.

Jammy, would you please do your take on the movie Prahaar. I felt that has been a classic yet no one actually talks about it and is kind of forgotten

Your videos are good but you NEED to stop saying &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot;

Into was EPIC

And the Intro made me realize that Bollywood copies small scenes and Screenplay as well.

One of the problematic scene I found was in Yes Boss where Shah Rukh Khan pulls Juhi Chawala&#39;s Hair and says &#39; Muje aur Majboor mat kro &#39;. I mean dude, you planted love for your boss in her heart, which later she finds that he is married, You have forcefully made her your wife, you love her and then you physically assault her. Kuch bhi!

Arya smaj mein shadi or group marriage
After watching this &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39; episodes the only thing comes to my mind is how Anmol sits through the entirety of this mostly bizarre films. Some of this films are just weird mess for my lack of better words to describe it. Kudos to you  man! and feel for you too.

nikal
Btw , Cricket ka kya thaa?

Bro... Jallikattu went to oscars... Can you do one more video on this plzzzz ???

The victim girl in tejaswini is Urvashi Dholakia

Hello , I have a request . There was a video in which you had put a scene at the very beginning in which :A woman bumps her head into a wall and then falls into a suitcase with &quot;patt se headshot&quot; playing in the background.It was related to an indian serial most probably.I have been looking for this video for a lot of time but cannot find it . Please help me find it .

It&#39;s really good that you went back to your original work that got you all your followers instead of poking fun at other youtubers...clearly that wasn&#39;t your best of times

The movie scenes in this video made me cringe. It&#39;s so disturbing to think what we audience have been consuming all these years in the name of entertainment. This is GROSS...

Cricket ka score kya hai?

Dear your patience level.. I also need that much for my life.
Intro was better than the whole video

I don’t know if you have talked about this, but in Main Anari Tu Khiladi. And how Akshay Kumar and Shilpa Shetty get together. They tell Akshay Kumar that he raped her. And that’s how they get together. The worst part is that it’s supposed to be a funny scene

Bhai yar had hoti  hai , ajib  tooth fairy political correctness, keep that out of art.

Bro qna and face reveal

Meaning kuch bhi.
It&#39;s okay to root for an actor like Shahid kapoor and call him out for his terrible filmography. You&#39;re not responsible for God awful movie choices.

Brother I have not watched cricket!
Jimmy, what a pitty. Bollywood world is full of such crap. I sincerely request to direct your efforts to find out good movies and not such crap. There is no kind of satisfaction we are earning in any way by seeing such crap...

True.... I like the end one

You are the hope!

<a href="">8:48</a> The burn marks on an almost burnt alive victim look way too real man Make up artist ki jai ho

Stalking bring all Indian films under one umbrella

Are u having a fever??

A+++ for the awesome intro! I willingly forgive all of Jammy&#39;s multiple instances of mispronunciation n bad grammar despite being an educated individual bcoz Joseph Gordon Levitt is bae!

Indeed, R Rajkumar is the worst movie of the decade. I wonder why a lot of people like this movieNext time, include some awful scenes from Singh is Blingh

This might be the best video jammy pants has made so far

2020: coolie no.1 releasingI understand that people respect david dhawan a lot in the industry and even the audience. But you dont have to degrade a minority, a gender or a specific position in society to make comedy. Honestly speaking even the stories he made back then dont work now, because of how much it chooses the route to mock ppl and use females as puppets to make people laugh. It was truly disappointing when anupama chopra asked both varun and david dhawan what they felt about the derogatory terms used for older women and the action of slapping the women’s asses. They completely dismayed that thought by just saying that ppl like comedy. I would respect them if they had realized their mistake, because honestly it is one. Its not even about the effect it has on the audience, its about moving with the times. You are ruining the though process of ppl that we soo wanted to move with the times and toward a better place in terms of representation of people in society. If that is the case with coolie, honestly i am gonna lose it. Its not acceptable in 2020.

Kayaa yar you haven&#39;t made a review on &quot; jane tu Ya janena&quot;

No..r Rajkumar was a entertaining movie.. stop over analysing

Not only Shahid, plz Change your opinions about ranbir as well

Haha, My and Jammy&#39;s struggle in calling out cringy movies when they are Shahid Kapoor&#39;s... T_____T

COPYWOOD(btw they make such things because our audiences deemand is such creep)

I`m from Bihar and these fucking scenes represent the chapri youth. now I know who is responsible.............

I have given the video a thumbs up i like your work...but cring itna zyaada tha k i had to quit watching...rip watch time @jammy..nice work btw bro

<a href="">6:53</a> i thought he said &quot;grope.. her ass...&quot;  i almost said &quot;Oh my!&quot; and clutched my pearls like an offended grandmother...

Besides the drugs case Bollywood needs to be boycotted for its misogynistic approach too.

i got a headache from knowing these plots, wtf will happen if i watch the movie..........

Started for creepy Matlab Kuch Bhi episodes, subscribed for the Oscar level film suggestions.... Keep both of them coming.. Love and good wishes always ️ @triedandrefusedproductions

Jaaved Bhai and Naseer Saab would be too ashamed to remember Tehelka, not sure about Aditya !

Finally someone actually pointed out the problematic films Sridevi did and her portrayal of abla naari.Otherwise she would be treated larger than life for doing these same films ! Matlab kuch bhi.....

Lmfao the intro

grow up its just entertainment..movies dont change the world..they just come and go..whats next?..you will look at a black comedy and say &quot;how can they laugh at something so serious?&quot;..

yawn... Naseeruddin Shah is overrated.

BC jab bollywood movie ke hindi scenes ki baat hai hain hai hain to english ki ja bhi rahe hain
I was searching for heroine in R.Rajkumarr.

<a href="">2:21</a> I just wonder Naseerudin Shah takes too much pride in his acting skills which very much reflects in his interviews. He is a damm good actor we all know, but in future, I think whenever he kind of loses out on politeness while talking about movies and stuff, he should be reminded of this movie.

Missed this

Review pls telugu flim <b>middle class melodies</b>
After watching this video.. Tonny Kakkar is laughing in corner 

Evening was good and then you used woke public...

Make video on children movies in bollywood like chillar party, bum bum bole etc. Now-a-days no one is making children movies :(

These scenes in 90s Same scenes continue till today ..

Jammy Rascals is an ugly remake of Dirty rotten scoundrels starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin. The original is way better

Really!!!We are all enjoyed this movie and now talking they are all shit.....Truth is we are need to refreshing through this movie

Make a Matlan Kuch  Bhi video on Serials...

That yellow top scene and shake it saiyyaan... Rascals was somehow my introduction to soft porn back then

Fuck everything else, I just got to know that Anmol supports Arsenal, the Banter Football club.

Jammy You should Watch Marathi Movie Timepass...

Make video s in hindi too

You are so good

Can you please do a video on k pop and its acceptance in India, and stereotypes around the subject. Please

It was all planned ,   they were , and they are  innocently   seeding garbage into our minds from the beginning ,

These kind of things are evident even in 2020, just watched Indoo ki Jawaani trailer. Whole trailer was like &#39;Matlab kuch bhi&#39;.Make a video on that if possible

Jammy what happened with the kaali khuhi video?Wanted to know your take on it tho

Pls make a review on perfect blue

So, Tejasvini was meant to be a feminist film which promoted the strength and independence of women and yet the main plot revolved around a sexual assault victim marrying her harasser? Shows just money minded and unappreciative of the art of filmmaking Bollywood was. Still is.

Yaay kuch bhi is back

A video on Top 10 fighting sequence will be a good idea

Wtchng all ur videos since many years..nd nw sme of ur dnce videos tooBut i wll alws be a fan of ur true review.

Cricket score kya hai..... Hilarious

The amount of time I facepalmed ..that I got a huge dent.

if the movie makers have to seek approval from armed forces for any portrayal, which SHOULD happen, than i wonder why a movie like Gunjan Saxena steered out of this and later had people from forces not approving with the facts shown in the movie.

I think &quot;kuch bhi&quot; Tony Kakkar's songs and his lyrics will be used in long episodes of the series.
I have a video idea, watch this malayalam movie called Charlie! Please I beg you, give this a shot

Bro when you&#39;re about hit millions sub&#39;s plz make &quot;matlb kuc bhi &quot; episode.That will be epic.

I know the inspiration here is GemsOfBollywood, you can also collaborate with them

My head hurts after watching all these EMBARASSING scenes

Sheldon Cooper 
You could do a matlab kuch bhi video solely on David Dhawan movies 

That rant by Woke citizen deserves a sequel or extebsion ,but what we get now in our movies ,Kartik Aryan relationship monologues ,this tells something about our cinema and society

I think i should take some English classes from you

Tharki Ajay and Sanjay Dutt
Ya only bollywood is wrong. Baki sare industries toh dudh se dhule hue hai.

The funniest part is that I went with my family to cinema hall to watch Rascals 

How cheap mentality of Bollywood is .But they said that Indian man are cheap ,they always stare girls badly.But who teach this cheapness to them , obviously Bollywood

500 Days of summer  an awesome movie 

I was a kid when I watched Tejasvini for first time and the Common man scene is the only scene which I liked and remembered till now

Well done for another wonderful video. I know how difficult it is to criticize good actors, but it is very necessary. Your videos bring awareness in people who don&#39;t realise the seriousness or affect of such plots in the movies. Please keep doing the great job.

500 days of summer and Dabangg 

Last scene was iconic... Absolutely right with our country.

This video is funny and sad at the same time.   No words.  Appreciate your content, keep up the good work :)

The intro and ending are just epic 

That raja ki ayegi barat where woman married her abuser.Or humara dil aapke pas hai , judai and ladala  another  mind less anil kapur movie where in he enlightens audience  that  Contract Marriage or with  practice of selling husband is common.

lol why dont you include ur fav actor&#39;s recent films? happy new year,chennair express and so on, stop being partial lol, SRK ko include krna start kro and stop including and finding fault in all of Salman&#39;s film, stop being biased

David dhawan,..the gang that whitewashed dawood's money in the film will continue to creep in.
You are slowly becoming a memer For opening segment
Jammy spreading hate kangana movement proud of u

Is that Kangana The A grade actress in rascal movie wow 

You should make a video about present-day movies which will make us feel the same way. Movies ten or fifteen years back would obviously feel completely unrelatable.

I just realized I liked watching, Rohit Shetty movie as a kid.

Bfor calling urmila Matondkar a soft porn star...kangana should re watch her film rascal..............

Benaam Badshah
That woke men and le public scene at the last tho.

tht Sheldon&#39;s  scene

<b>Not 5, this is nothing, watch more u will find more than 500k..There was no need of making this video, everyone knows</b>

Jallikatu made it to the Oscars 

Review andhakaram tamil on Netflix

Bollywood movies are full of creepy and scary situations .Stalking looks romantic and fun in movies but its extremely scary and disturbing .Also  in Bollywood movies actresses needlessly wear exposed and revealing clothes .

Mard (1985) is also one of the cringiest movie.

Seriously .. salman khan literally ruined the dance scene from my all time favourite movie

<a href="">9:09</a> that had me crying
Anmol it&#39;s a request please make a seperate video playlist on animation series with explanation.

Sexual assault/abuser doesn’t do it. It’s rape/rapist. Just because it’s cinema and glamourised doesn’t mean it’s less gruesome

@even ajay devgn regrets doing this movie

There was a very annoying white outline in the last frame. Please keep it checked

Petition for jammy to make more kuch bhi episodes

Don&#39;t you think that Bollywood also portrayed Gays and homosexuals in a wrong way.. It is also a stereotype. Please make a video on this.

I find this admirable that Jammy has finally criticised Shahid for his awful movie selection too. This makes it more organic and authentic now as it’s good to praise your favourites for their positives but don’t hesitate to highlight their negatives too as required by the video requirement.Hats off buddy, you win me over again for your wisdom and authenticity.

People wont protest against such movies but they will instead protest against movies such as The Suitable boy, padmavat and many more. The hypocrisy of people is un-understandable.

Please review &quot;The Wailing.&quot; It is a 2016 Korean Psychological Horror &amp; Thriller. A masterpiece.

I think u see only best movies of south otherwise u would know how cringe 90% movies were made there

tejasvini was disturbing af...how high were the writers and producers to release such a stupid movie

You should sit in the committee who gives away awards to put some sense into them. Please teach them the true art of films. Bollywood is pathetic

now i can understand that why in India rape,stalking ,abuse, molestation are so common...

After watching movies/series like mad max,scarface,shutter island,inception,peaky blinders, the crown and so on bollywood looks trash (new).

Make a video on best films by Soumitro Chatterjee

Seriously This Is Why These Bollywood Films Don&#39;t Truly Deserves To Be Part Of The Oscars Thank God Thought Provoking Malayalam Movie Like Jallikattu Has Officially Been Selected For Upcoming Oscars 2021 From India

Welcome home recommend for u

How shamelessly they trolled Gangasanan

Waiting for baagamathie review

Mithun Chakraborty and Dharmendra with their 50+year old boyish look delivered the most number of &#39;kuch bhi&#39; movies and dialogues. You can&#39;t even rank their mishaps.It&#39;s not that they are not great acotrs but that late 90s era compelled many actors to do that creep movies.

How do you go through these horrible movies?

That Tejaswini scene is the sad reality of India

some of the scenes were so disturbing to watch

Very well put. But the show fails to shock based on when what we see in real life on TV regarding marriage of rape victims HIgh Courts have given similar <a href="">rulings.Movie</a> tho simply filmy.

<a href="">2:36</a> 
Kuch bhi episodes are the best 

Jammy could you do one about remakes again. Movies that are inspired from Hollywood. Or a list of Bollywood movies that are novel adaptations

When my friend ask tr his marks in maths Le maths teacher-clean bold.........

I remember watching rascals when I was  11 years old. My brother was 17. We bought a 6 in 1 DVD 5 of the pictures was good. We enjoyed but rascals. And we quit the film. That was embarrassing.  Later we watched it on star gold international where they actually cut all the creepy scenes. Yet we couldn&#39;t finish this. So problematic.

Great video jammy .
Kangana may b did this movie for money  as she told this in many of her interviews

Hye jammy , please review some of the best made movies in the history of cinema and that is korean movies 

The last scene though 
Most of the Bollywood movies are so cringy ,stupid .. illogical .........aaisa main nahi kahunga .....Most of Bollywood movies Chuttad, Lodalehsunbhosadpappuzamanchuranbhaskr,Zhaattad ...hai ....dil ko sukoon milta hai aisa bolkaar ....

Kangana Ranaut said in an interview that this was her worst phase in Bollywood specially being cast in Rascals and she felt that she didn&#39;t belong in this movie..she wasn&#39;t getting other roles owing to her straightforward ness and the Hrithik Roshan controversy

CRICKET SCORE
Kangana never approved of her character development in Rascals and also suggested that the bikini scene was useless. However she wadnt as succesful as the other 2 male stars in that big budget film and hence had to do it for the sake of her career.Even Lisa Haydon didnt like the movie experience, both of them had spoken about it during Queen&#39;s promotions

I felt off my sofa laughing after the last scene of cricket 

wtf., what was all this...creepy

Unbearable video 

From where you get this kind of movie 

Man I can&#39;t even see these scenes Don&#39;t know how people used to watch such movies back in theaters

Score kya hai??

I guess only thing to say about old 90s movies is that those movies were accurate discription of Stalkhome syndrome other than that nothing

Can you make a video on how to make Indian horror movies relevant again

BOLLYWOOD MADHARCHOD THA,BOLLYWOOD MADHARCHOD HAI,BOLLYWOOD MADHARCHOD RAHEGA

AJ is Baackk

I still wonder how David Dhawan thought Rascals would make people laugh.

Hey jammy! This was sooo effing hilarious, though really took a toll on my logic craving braincells. Can you next do a review on animation in India and how it went from audience favourites like x-men, dragon ball and zatch bell to a 24/7 screening of the likes of motu patlu and chhota bheem? Like, are these people still under the impression that anime is only meant for 5-year olds?! And that too when the heroes of the day get their superpowers from Laddoos and samosas like wtf?

Its crazy , i subbed ur channel when u had around 100k subs. Now we&#39;re heading towards a million.

Kangana is biggest creep in term on acting.. because of her bakri like vlice

On the contrary to matlab kuch bhi as being a funny or bizarre plot in Bollywood movies, this is actually this country of &quot;matlab kuch bhi....&quot; yes, you heard it right, it has actually happened in our country where the rapist and the victim had to get married to each other, victim was actually forced to marry her abuser. And its either in the same case or some other i don&#39;t remember but she (assuming it was the same case) got knocked up and was denied abortion, she was denied a decision of her own body.There are a lot of fucked up shit that happens in this nation.Just yesterday a law was passed in a unrealistic state of Uttar Pradesh about love Jihad an imaginary concept without any evidence or proof of forceful conversion.

Do dm. Saath m hilayenge.
When you said &quot;you want to know the bizarre aspect of the movie though&quot; i knew it in that very moment they will get married. Coz that&#39;s what happens in almost every other movie specifically of that time. <a href="">#himmat_aur_mehnat</a>

Woh sab toh theek hai but cricket ka score kya hai?

Although I always appreciate your &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot; videos, I always get a headache after watching these videos 

Yayy! Always excited to watch matlab kuchh bhi episodes!

I m pretty sure there will be embarasing scenes in coolie no 1

I LITERALLY wait for Matlab kuch bhi video every month !!
Bro make a video on will jallikatu win oscar

Watch, watch all cricket, watch all cricket
What even

Last scene 
Intro
<a href="">9:09</a> <b>preach!!</b>this is the kind of clips that need to go viral instead of everything stupid that has been going on these days!

The narration of the storyline of Rascals itself was so unbearable..

Another suggestion for a Jeetendra - Sri Devi movie is Mazaal . Just watch it . You will find Himmat Aur Mehnat much better . Some of the scenes are really pathetic in that movie .

I just watched temple of the doom   

The actress in Tejasvini looks like Sri Devi&#39;s daughter, I can&#39;t recall her name right now for some reason.

Poor Jammy  He obviously loves Kabir Singh and knows how audience is divided over it. Can&#39;t even appreciate fully, can&#39;t even criticize it fully.

did someone understood what Sri Devi said while attempting suicide?

Jallikkettu for Oscars ️️️️
The channel is now clearly prioritizing the manufacturing of controversial content to drive viewership.

Do watch Kalyug aur Ramayan , it has some great MKB scenes

This guy is such a Women wow. Liberal men are Women. What is one little thing that is wrong with Kabir singh? So if guys act weird in movies its regressive and if girls act weird its wrong portrayal of women this is the Liberal women minded Logic.

I think you should rename &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot; to &quot;What the F***?&quot;

Nice video bhai...
OMFG!! the first one!!these great actors had to do such embarrassing roles!

The most disturbing part is that it used to be law in many countries that if the rapist marries the victim he will be exonerated of the crime. It existed until around 1970’s. Even today in many societies it is practiced in one form or the other.

When it comes to depiction of armed forces over the top action Border takes the cake.I know the movie did its purpose.My uncle while being an instructor had questions being asked from Border movie reference.

He is so underrated he deserves 1m guys lets do it for him

Oops I thought the intro was some ad And then I realised this a few secs later LOL

I was very young when r Rajkumar came but still I found it creepy and disgusting

Tejasvini shocked me &amp; scared me to the core. I was really small when I saw it till that rape scene. I stopped the movie there &amp; felt haunted

Man i feel sorry for you. You have watch all this mind numbing bullshit just for us. We don&#39;t deserve you Jammy.

This is full on full cringe fest. You must have ultimate patience to watch these kinds of shitty films. Love your dedication bro️️

By &#39;creep&#39; you mean &#39;cringe&#39;, right?
This is ethically and morally wrong.You can&#39;t be making Matlab Kuch Bhi episodes on Indian cinema You will never be short of content then Indian cinema is 100-plus years of pure shit or bull crap interspersed with a handful of good movies.When 90 % of the content produced over the course of a century is Kuch Bhi, how can you make a Matlab Kuch Bhi every month Have some mercy 

Ooohhh so that fuckn sick movie is called Tejaswini.

That last scene...UURRGH
And this kangana says films teach us wrong stuff 

Will you also do the review of tenet also start reviewing foreign films and love you bro

<a href="">6:05</a> the scene is predictable.

When I see movies like Bazaar, Massom, Ijaazat, Iqbal, A Wednesday, Ishqiya, Sarfarosh I just can&#39;t believe that an actor like Naseeruddin Shah could also do such embarrassing commercial masala movies.

What is mean by mat lab kuch bhi?

Hey jammy loved this episode. It&#39;s evergreen. Please review SIR, it&#39;s a beautiful film. Will act as a tonic after all these kuch bhi

Jammy should get a big round of applause for his guts to revisit R. Raj Kumar once again.

Ur content is so classy....you should make some logical movies to save bollywood...most of the movies suck!

<a href="">8:39</a> is that Rajdeep Sardesai ?

Rascals was way ahead of its time. I mean way ahead...I mean millions and millions ahead of its time.

Intro is superb

When u spoke about himmat and Mehnat I remembered a malayalam film named kettiyolaanu ente malakha (available on Amazon Prime)...the film is an absolute portrayal of marital rape and the awkwardness and wierdness between the couple after the incident....I reccomend you to do an analysis on the same...cuz bhai something about that film is making the malayalam audience call it their favourite and I still can&#39;t figure out why

A movie like &#39; Rascals&#39; should never exist. The movie is so bad.

Angry Kangana fans incoming.
okay so 500 days of summer was a prequel of Dabbang,well didn&#39;t knew this

Anmol, quality of your content is evolving like a fine Italian wine! So proud of you!

Best Intro and Ending of TRP.

Only an arsenal man through and through can endure such content with utmost patience

Please watch and review &quot;Welcome Home&quot; from Sony Liv.  Its a must watch thriller.

Review gatham amazon prime

Anmol, Can you review succession, i really wanna know your thoughts on that show

You are dead right about the scene at <a href="">9:06</a>.... A few movies have tried showing the mirror to our India public but sadly nothing much seems to have changed.

How do you reseach for your videos? It&#39;s pretty awesome.

Just a point to consider.I understand the intention of this series is to point out the regressive and out right plagiarized moments in Indian cinema. But to keep mentioning the need for &quot;socially appropriate&quot; cinema can also lead to a severe overcorrection to the other direction. Ultra moralistic or socially acceptable content also leads to rigid thinking. In the end it&#39;s the exploration of art that always suffers. I feel the major problem and the reasons why cinema like these were made, is because of pandering and lack of sincerity from the creators (i.e, writers, directors and producers) to the story.Also, big fan of your channel.All the best.

Last time I was this early, Coolie no 1 still had Govinda as it&#39;s hero

Please make a video on the battle which so long kiski waje se movies k gaaane hit hote hain ,the one who composed sung, the writer or the hero of the movie whom it was picturized on???

Bro you forgot conversation btw Rajesh Khana and sridevi maqsad

Intro of the video 999999%

I want U as my English Teacher

Jammy, please do a video on obsession of k-drama by current teenagers.

<a href="">9:09</a> This shows the effect of Cinema and Cricket in our society. Even in corona times, IPL took place and movies are releasing on OTT platforms. Why? So that the citizens are occupied. If they have nothing to do, it&#39;s dangerous.

The last one was preposterous. I am disgusted by the fact that such movies were approved by the censor board.

U r right but these films are made for money only. We don&#39;t expect anything good from these movie makes.

It&#39;s our Bollywood,you will always find portray of Hindus, Indian army,hindu rituals and Hindu gods are very bad and pathetic and will always find a muslim character as saccha mulsaman....

watched 500 days of summer after your recommendation and absolutely loved the movie. ps: i watched it for the same reason you did

Jammy, make a video on eeb allay ooo and chaitanya Tamhane&#39;s work.

I was thinking that movie making is essentially a field of creative arts but a section of bollywood has only considered it as a profit making industry so they produce shit after shit in the name of entertainment and they justify it by saying that public wants to see it but I personally have come to realise that this justification maybe put forward only to hide their own lack of talent, skill or creativity coz public is surely looking for more varied options rather than just formula films. So blaming public for bad content creation by bollywood is a argument that should no longer be used.

Claim your here before million views.

What&#39;s for 1 million celebration?️️️
Gone are the days of shahid kapoor of Kaminey and haider, now he jumped on the bandwagon of remakes. Hopefully the remake of recent Suriya movie on Deccan airlines founder with shahid doesnt get made. Come on his career from r.rajkumar and Kabir singh to telugu and tamil going forward is just remakes.

We are getting close to hit A Million

The ending thouIts sad but hilarious  Lol

Agnipariksha?  you can&#39;t make this shit up man.... wtf..
Now Jammie is in comic mood.. it suits him to the fullest...

Like for the last scene from tejaswini

I wonder how you keep your cool after watching such trash! How do you detoxify?BTW good job calling a spade a spade and exposing Bollywood that makes sweeping claims of producing art.

Kangana Ranaut - &quot; I&#39;m the pioneer of feminism in Bollywood.&quot;Also kangana ranaut - * does stripping scene disguised as a &#39;comic scene&#39; , solely for the purpose of satisfying the male gaze and reducing women to a mere object. *

Bro upload a video on jallikattu&#39;s official entry to Oscar

Wo army wala sabse behuda tha.. just saying!

<a href="">2:25</a> how can we expect Naseeruddin Shah and Javed Jafri to call out an objection on such objectional scene of Indian army ‍️

The word titillate though

Kuch bhi episode seriously

I can&#39;t imagine what Naseeruddin sir would have felt doing that film

David dhawan king of embarrassing scene

Haaawww, <a href="">0:00</a> I never realised Dabangg copied this scene from 500 days of summer

Watching this makes me remember HOUSEFUL  where they are making fun of a black baby and thn homosexuality and surely ghatiya  sajid nadia.... problematic scenes...

Kids - Roasting guru &quot;CarryMinati&quot;Men - Roasting guru &quot;Tried and Refused Production&quot;

You have to watch Policewala Gunda 2. It is one bizzare movie. The actor and actress both grope each other&#39;s behinds throughout the movie and there are end number of problematic dialogues.

Jammy, you really need to make  a video on underrated Directors. You&#39;ll nail it.

I&#39;m sorry but I have to disagree with the last 2.I haven&#39;t watched Tejasvini so I don&#39;t know what it is actually about. But judging from the scenes that you showed, it didn&#39;t seem that bad for a 1994 movie. Yes what we are watching does seem weird but you have to see it from their point of view. The scene with the son rejecting the girl shows how spoilt he is. The scene with the father shows the kind of society we had in those days, and the part with the cop trying to get the girl married to the guy seems like she&#39;s trying to mock the abusers in a vengeful way since the system had already failed them. Though I might be wrong, I would have to watch the movie to understand its full meaningNow for Rascals. I mean, what did you even expect when you read that name? I&#39;ve already watched this movie and at least to me it didn&#39;t seem that creepy, not because it was not (it was) but because I was already expecting it to be, so why should I complain? It&#39;s like watching those erotic Ekta Kapoor movies and then complaining about over sexualization. The movie was supposed to be like this, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have liked it if it was anything less.

Phuck

Jamie you are talking about 1994 , and India is still in the same way.

That Creepy Bra scene in the Train by Protagonist in <a href="">#DDLJ</a> Logo ka Taste Kharab tha tab, ab PR team ki wajah se chali jaah rahi hain Warna TV pe Maha flop hain

I am Sridevi and Kangana Fan but you rightly pointed out that those two were horrible movies

Please make a video on FOOTBALLER Maradona

For your own safety , Kangana better not watch this thumbnail 

I was always disgusted with David dhawan&#39;s so called comedy.! Most of his comic sequences were creepy. Varun dhawan is carrying the legacy forward.

Indian film industry needs to watch Jammy’s video and learn something from it.

And the irony is Padmashree Kangana Ranaut mocks her fellow actors for the bad choice of films. She called their films mediocre and bad however her films like Rascals, Rajjo, etc are equally bad or even worse.

Need Biography of famous actors here and in outside....

Hey Anmol I have seen your video in which you talked about how  the actors&#39; accent was failing so I think you should make another video like that and also include the movie batti gul meter chalu as the actors in the movie have done a terrible  immitation of uttrakhund &#39;s accent

Great video as usual 
Watch &quot;Arjun Pandit&quot;

Jammy, was watching aakhree raasta.. in a sequel, when jaya prada was trying to teach English to her visibly gawar husband aka Mr. Bachhan.. she said I will BEAT you and explained the meaning of same.. to which our hero, the man, the husband responded with- I will RAPE you!! And trust me it was brushed off as harmless banter.. Matlub kuch bhi...

You are doing a great job @jammypants4 . Best of luck for future great videos️

India's public is crazy *period
Wow , Jammy have been here from 400k subscribers , now I&#39;m witnessing 800k subscribers . The growth is really phenomenal and wishing you to move ahead and entertain this community with your own class as always you do so

movies in the 90&#39;s were disgusting. when rape, misogyny, and gender subservience are portrayed comically, u realise how perverse, pathetic, and disingenuous people in our society are

Always coming in clutch for online classes.

Legends say nazaruddhin Shah  became coming of age actor after that horrible movie

has anyone watch CITY OF GOLD  2010 bollywood movie ? check it out

intro shows how much Bollywood copy others 

Seriously wtf  censor board was doing.  How these scenes were even allowed to release? ‍️‍️
MATLAB KUCH BHI IS THE NEW MOTO
Man how can one watch these old Bollywood movies

Hannah Would have Married Bryce if 13 reasons why was made in Bollywood.

<a href="">9:10</a> ohh god!  ️ ️ but bc!
The intro is really cool

HEY JAMMY, HAVE YOU WATCHED 500 ( DAYS OF SUMMER)? HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?( ASKING BECAUSE OF THE INTRO)....

Jammy is making the great introo.. thankuuuu jammy for making this series becoz there is soo much bad content and regressive that we need to acknowledge

Jammy do you like Kay Kay me on or abhay deol more?

Can u plz review bigg boss
There is a reason for this kind of films being made. 90 percent of the people going to theatres were male.So the films were made to satisfy the perverted fantasies and sexual frustrations of males. We live in a patriarchal society and also a sexually closed one. So the only way for males to satisfy their perverted sexual desires is these kind of films.Now that ott platforms are booming female audiences are  also in demand. So films are being more gender nuetral nowadays.

Jammy Jallaikatu has reached Oscar nominations
Can u plz review bigg boss

From paatshala to rajkumar I don&#39;t know what happened to shahid kapoor 

Only Gandi Baat choreography is the best thing about R Rajkumar

I find it weird that millions of people collectively just find this ok against their better judgement?? And this stuff actually had to be called out by a person?? Anyway, really entertaining to watch you criticize this stuff lol  still love Bollywood tho, but this stuff is unacceptable!!

My holy fire has come  Meaning even a little...
I think u just scratch surface,Bollywood have ek se badkar ek

Agaya agaya agaya matlab kuch bhiWatched tahalka before..Tab samajh mein nahi ayaKaunsa Army officer aisa bolta hai??Bamboo lag jayegaR. Rajkumar ka dialogues were crap..Dance,music,action was ok par baki dialogues sayad kuch phukke likh raha thaThat marry your abuser concept is still thr in reality in our Country..Sad but true..Kangana wala movie main theatre mein dekha tha..Sar dard ho gaya thaTejaswini was at par with all the cringy movies during that time..Worse,people loved it and some people even now do

You know Bollywood is bizarre when there are so many &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot;episodes

Well it was normal to expect this from Bollywood which has been a <b><i>&quot;woman-objectifying&quot;</i></b>  machine that has been operating for around 100 years.

I expected tamil movie Andhaghaaram review  . Pls do that.

Did you review <a href="">#Andhaghaaram</a> recently?

Sir please make a video on top 5/10 worst performances in Bollywood movies by good actors.

I&#39;m speechless, aree all of childhood is dokha

The intro tho
Tahalka showed the real face of Indian Army
Start 
The ending was perfectVoke citizen vs media vs publicLmao

Please watch mansoon shootout! Underrated gem!

Without further delay,Here are some movies, I recommend you to watch (Tamil only)Aayirathil Oruvan - starring Karthi, Andrea, Reema Sen and Parthiban (2010)Paradesi - starring Atharva, Sai Dhanshika and Vedhika (2013)Mayakkam Enna - starring Dhanush, Richa Langella (2011)Thara Thappattai - starring Shashikumar and Varalakshmi Sharathkumar (2016)And...Thats the list bro..I will get to you later

Jammy your sense of humor is awesome.. The intro was lit  

Lockdown has relly helped Anmol&#39;s humour  Excellent intro again

Matlab kuch bhi series can be endless. Itni pathetic movies banti hai. This is all people want to watch. Ab bhi ekta Kapoor gandi bat bana rahi hai and people enjoy it. What is left

Matlab Kuch bhii series  gives Jammy never ending content 
Can&#39;t see 500 days of summer without salman khan in it now. Ruined 

Jammy: Uploads a videoPseudoprofound Suvichaar vaale: allow us to introduce ourselves

Still nothing has changed , bas they changed way of showing. Society sucks

BOllywood Or I Say A Full Copy Of Hollywood : )

 the jammy your are awesome 

Kab aa rha bro mtlb kuch merch
Seriously!....what were they even thinking while writing such scenes and how did even these actors agree  to do the sameLater they fight for women rights Hypocrisy and bullshit!Matlab kuch bhi !!!

First view

The true fact is that &#39;MKB&#39; series nourished the &#39;inside-humour sense&#39; of Jammy more and more by each episodes

<a href="">6:39</a> i was watching Rascal with my mother. And that seen in the Hospital. Made us change the channel. 

The end is awesome

Can we see a review of tenet when it releases in india I have been waiting this movies for months and I feel I wanna go to the theater for that film

<a href="">0:10</a> why did hollywood copy our Bhai

Matlab Kuch bhi: A dialogue said by Sharib Hashmi,                                But Conceptualized by TRP!

Shahid Kapoor&#39;s Phata Poster Nikla Hero is better than R Rajkumar. Also, if Phata Poster Nikla Hero was released 15 years before, then it would have been blockbuster.

Pls watch Andhaghaaram movie available on Netflix....

<b>&quot;It does not make sense. It cannot exist. It&#39;s impossible, and if it isn&#39;t impossible, it&#39;s irrelevant, and if it isn&#39;t either of those things, it&#39;s embarrassing&quot;...</b>-Philip Pullman Thought of the day...

50th. But here at midnight. Lol.

Hello jammy thought on durgamati remake of bhagmati

Hey Jammy.. Keep doing the good work.. Ur concepts are truly worth watching

Heeeeey please watch NPCB a beautiful malayalam movie about self discovery. I DMed u on Instagram too. If you loved karwaan this is another level.

The greatest thing Tehelka did for audiences was the gorgeous Shikha Swaroop in uniform. ️

Hi jammy ,Please make a video abt the turkish dramas also. They r really excellentN also talk abt why they stopped telecasting in india

What ever happens don&#39;t change the intro

I want to show this channel&#39;s videos to those people who say &quot;80s or 90s were the golden days.&quot; Or &quot;Proud to be a 90s kid.&quot; 

Please watch manu movie !

Petition for Jammy to officially review the great Show called Euphoria.   P.S. I got heart last time reagrding this comment, lets see if it happens again

Love the series.Matlab kuch bhi lol

Jammy, Please make a video on bhabiji Ghar par hai serial, where there is scene where manmohan tiwari gets molested but it is presented in a humorous way.

Jammy is back with his Kuch Bhi series!

Another month another matlab kuch bhi ️

Pls give me a heart

The Intro is Really cool. Jammy know some good humor.

Bruh? Didn’t you like the dabanng dance and song? To be inspired by something it’s never wrong? Quentin tarantino does it in most of the movies? But i can get by your videos where you criticise things, you don’t actually think about if it was good or bad! You are just ‘Chalo criticise karna accha bura baad ke video me dekhenge’

Someone pointed out the blatant plagiarism in Dabangg that you shared in the beginning, somedays ago, you could&#39;ve at least given him a shoutout.
