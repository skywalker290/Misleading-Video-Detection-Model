Ethical spending is a privilege

t series vs pewds   lets roll the dice

PewDiePie hates cricket, guess i will just unsubscribe then!!

<a href="">2:51</a> its not censored

Pewdipie 1 laugh=1 dollarKsi 1 laugh= 1000 dollar

Pewdiepie has to give 1/1000000000000000th of his yearly take home: 😡😡😡

Dav went back in time and jacked the silvver bullet i made when i made J as an angel with William and the rest were solid white. I know where all of it exists. Josh Wyatt is the murderer??. It could be Jason Miller??. Both got life sentences 20 years ago. Josh Singletary performa black magic projects.

Fat cat is nonsense, the owner can feed him less and he will lose weight.

Ricky Gervais is a genius . You completely missed the point of the performance Pewdy. 😅😅😅That’s  really funny . It’s about making jokes not about preaching.

<a href="">10:28</a> people from US* and not white people.... because we (around the world) enjoy football which also be called soccer by the same nation :D

<a href="">8:14</a>  who made this meme has a special place in hell

That fretted guitar would have a better chance of being musically significant if it was made out of fruit rollups. Which static disharmonic interval could be of any consequence whatsoever? Or play more than 1 harmonic.

ay mr felix you got jesus number or we force him down by anti haha

hi felix how ya dowin my child ( high old

i wish I had 1. 😔
Game looks like binding of Isaac Ngl but on mobile kinda cool

Men start wars.
basketball is the most meaningless game ive ever seen

I love how at <a href="">2:42</a> it’s censored and then it’s just like the editor gave up. 😂

I know it’s kinda late but thanks for donating to help through those fires as it effected a lot of people.

If you don’t use sweat shops those people starve

when he said “i replaced your dna with fruit by the foot” and then looked at him and said something i thought that something  was “that would ne MDMA my friend” i laughed so hard then realized it wasn’t that 😂😂😂

Please somebody give me a link to buy the shirt pewds is wearing!

Where is ocarina of time gameplay 😢

I&#39;m still waiting for the Ocarina of Time gameplay

I feel like I died inside, bc I remember watching stuff like this when I was around 18-20, now I’m 28, decided to rewatch these videos just to see if I react differently, and I can’t even crack a smile, damn

I like pewds, but why do you have to blaspheme every 10 seconds!

&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Fun Fact: There is a phenomenon called Paris Syndrome where people are so immensely disappointed by how different Paris is from media representation that they experience anxiety, derealization, hallucination, etc.

webtoon to Disney Greeks

I love how he donated 1600 at the end. ❤

I’m French and Paris is the worst city of my country

21k

I almost made it to the end... then he made the &quot;waman&quot; reference

Don&#39;t distreeminate
I love you pewdiepie ❤
That’s just ratatouille‘s family

&quot;Everyone who thought that was f* epic better not had been holding an iPhone&quot;This is why I watch you!

That can’t isn’t far, my cat’s stomach drags the ground

even if you care about where things come from, everything you own has something made in china. Literally almost everything in the world has something that came from china.

scooby doo, shaggy, and theMOTHERFYCING GANG

On the mandalorian clip I thought he said “q pendejoooo” lmao 😂

definitely not Tim cook. his name is Ricky gervais and he is fan fucking fantastic

the cat story will turn diff and considered as body shaming in 2022

Nice

pewds made zero sense talking about Ricky Gervais. I was like ?!?! the whole time , litterally zero logic in his words

<a href="">6:46</a> That‘s why they’re called Cell phones

OMG A MACEDONIAN VID ON PEWDS CHANNEL????? The marriage proposal vid was such a meme hahahha

I do care where my stuff comes from

Nice number

You can be angry about sweatshops and still buy Chinese made goods. A major issue is a lot of stuff we use and need are Chinese made so its not as easy as just don&#39;t buy it.

Distreeminate*

gotta say that felix is bloody right about paris, the whole city is in work, there is almost not a single street where there are no work on buildings etc, there are trashes everywhere, idfk what happened to Paris, but the mayor is doing shit to help the city.

Pewdiepie: I feel generous today.MrBeast: Am i a joke to you?

<a href="">5:03</a> PewDiePie when are you going to deliver your promise of a let&#39;s play of legend of Zelda ocarina of Time

Timbers tickled

Just noticed how much taking the Lord&#39;s Name i vain there was in that clip 🤔

Felix&#39;s Swedish accent reminds me of marzia&#39;s channel.

I don&#39;t

@PewDiePie
no ricky gervais slander omg
Felix in JAN 2020 : &quot; People still making tik tok ? &quot; 🥴
<a href="">02:52</a> Wasn’t redacted the 2nd time around

I&#39;m just confused why his homie be wearing a mask on video inside ffs 🤣

<a href="">2:53</a> the word... after social...

He doesn&#39;t know the emotions of cricket

You shouldn&#39;t get to remove them for you not laughing that&#39;s just a +0

Still waiting for that ocarina of time lets play

If you like this comment I&#39;ll recycle cans

Felix hate for Amerika is funny lol

There are three types of cricket. Test cricket, ODI cricket, T20 cricket. Test cricket is boring but T20 and ODI is fantastic.

&quot;I&#39;m never reading comments again...&quot;Felix reading the comments 5 seconds later 🤡

PLEASE PLAY A ZELDA GAME!!!

Felix the apple simp

<a href="">2:28</a> it actualy happened live on the television 🤣

I don’t think that iphone argument holds up felix

I agree Paris sucks

“That was a lame episode when he was manager”Bruh he was manager for like 2 seasons

So why are you so hypocritical of sweatshops in China when you have your shop set up in CANADA. The worst country for c02 emissions per person and they treat indigenous peoples like shit

Bunch of NA humor

1yr later felix is paying a 100 💵 per laugh HAHA 😹

What if JJ do this challenge 🙃

He dint get the Ratatouille meme

You already know mf’ers in jail commenting on this video.

Baseball is one of those sports that’s more fun to play than watch. When ur in person a baseball game is fun to watch. Hockey games are fun all around.

&quot;Paris is no longer Paris, it&#39;s gross&quot;Bold to assume that Paris was ever clean at any point in history. I&#39;m pretty sure Paris has just been keeping its identity intact, thank you very much.

<a href="">9:40</a> he wasn&#39;t saying that he doesn&#39;t buy from China, he was saying that the actors shouldn&#39;t preach about being moral while they have all there products made in sweat shops

I got this reccomended this a year laterMust have been because its episode 69

<a href="">10:47</a> :)))

Cringy video tbh
I already donated by giving you a view its 15 cents but it counts

addison rae tik toking poods: &quot;is that lele pons??&quot; AHAHA

Make it $5 a laugh you rich f*ck

I have to agree with the whole thing about sports like I’m an American and all I give a crap about is one college football team but fr watching rugby is so much more entertaining and it’s so much shorter.

still waiting on that ocarina of time playthrough

where the shirt come from though?

Me just realizing Pewds was saying &quot;Scythe&quot; three minutes into the video like 👀

The fact they choose to manufacture Tsuki in Canada proves brands don’t need their customers to force them into better business habits. They simply choose not to until their business begins to tank.

Great vid,my inspiration

Hiiii

EPISODE 69!!!

I feel like Pewds made a big mistake in this video for defending slavery in China. Ricky’s Point was that they’re hypocrites for not caring about slavery in China or where their products come from.It’s kind of like saying that slavery in the US in the 19th century was okay because the people in Great Britain didn’t care where their cotton imports came from.

I alrdy lost it at “shiver me timbers”!!! 🤣🤣🤣
this is the 69th ylyl he could have done somthing better

<a href="">10:26</a> it&#39;s fucking true tho lol.  i remember one night i went outside for a cigarette during one of the games.  i didn&#39;t even know it was on - i haven&#39;t followed baseball since i was like thirteen.  some crazy shit happened, i can&#39;t remember what, but i do remember having the absolute shit scared out of me when every neighborhood in earshot just fucking went nuts all at the same time.  it was an interesting experience, the sound was just so indescribable.

Millionaire cries because the donation is more than one didget numbers

Why didn&#39;t you do a 69 themed episode for the 69th episode

Without the beard. It like looking at old pewdiepie with different soul and person. Like he is some android in the future.

you can still find the iphone joke funny and have an iphone if you dont give a fuck about sweat shops

The cat one was on my local news a year ago

Why 1600 tho?

nice

Did he just roast apple users and then held his samsung 30 seconds later although samsung‘s brand had started in korea*

He’s got corona in his throat

Pewdiepie : puts 3 ads, youtubers that just started getting their monetized ads, THEM : PUT ADS ON EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF THE 10 MINUTE VIDEO

<a href="">6:04</a> What&#39;s that food?

I would care but I can&#39;t afford to buy Poodz jumper for about £70 with post fees and stuff

&quot;you can&#39;t really call out Tim cook for using slave labor even though I agree it&#39;s a bad thing because most people don&#39;t care&quot;People don&#39;t point out enough that basically every time pewds tries to give a serious opinion it&#39;s like objectively shit.

Nice

For all the curious people there, the drifting at the <a href="">2:00</a> can be done in real life. He did a normal drift on the first turn, then transitioned into a reverse drift. There are really cool videos of real cars doing reverse drifts 10/10 recommend

Doesn’t laugh at all.

<a href="">9:43</a> Why do you produce ethically in Canada? Canadians can have decent-paying jobs.Why not produce ethically in China so that those who have to go to work in sweatshops come and work for your ethical company?

Felix: loses one dollar.  Dutch Van der lin has entered the chat, we been more money Arthur

Every one you need to see prince eu he made me  happy he gave me hope And I know its cheap to go to the best channel and promote some one else but please give him a try    SNOWY WAS HERE

Now Felix is broke

Was it me or did some of the audio cut out ?

ok he planned on giving 1600$ from the start. he could’ve donated 1900 so he can say i will donate hundred times the amount i should’ve
