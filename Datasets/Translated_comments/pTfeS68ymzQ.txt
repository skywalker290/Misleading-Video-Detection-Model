It was really nice gesture from her. 😊👍

Her father was German her mom was Bengali.. after their parents divorced her mother married a Hyderabadi who was also Muslim. So her mom adopted his surname. Thus Dia Handrich became Dia Mirza. I always wondered why she looks like Bengali with western touch 😄. Well now I know

Fate did not do justice with such a nice girl.Alas! at last she has found happiness.

She was married to a Pakistani.
