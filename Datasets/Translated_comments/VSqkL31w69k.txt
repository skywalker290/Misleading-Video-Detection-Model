Galaxy Fold or Mate X?

12gb wow

I have a 1st gen galaxy fold, and i absolutely love it

I&#39;m watching this on 1st October 2023 with my Z fold 4 after fold 5 came out 😂

Watching this again after many years, and after ordering the new 2023 Z Fold 5! 😀I was so hyped when this first came out, but the cost was prohibitive, and the issues that plagued it put me off.Went from S10+ to S21 Ultra since Galaxy Fold was announced.Now, five updates later, in 2023, I am emotional at, finally, getting a folding phone with matured technology and software, and this video gives me the same magic energy I had for the Galaxy Fold, but soon to be realised via the shortly incoming Z Fold 5 🥹😊

My fold 3 literally came in a totinos pizza box with no charger

Watching this on my Fold 4

Watching this on my S22 Ultra while waiting on my Fold 4 to come in this Tuesday. Just wanted to look at where we came from!

我认为这个挺好用的

Can it fit 12 gamesssss

OMG...how much????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Watched this video when it came out, now 3 years later I have my first foldable phone the Z Fold 3 and so far it&#39;s amazing!

Just watching this on my Fold 3, I can I&#39;ve had every fold and I&#39;m never going back to slab phones I love them so much its the future ❤️

Hmm. Not bad, not bad at all. Now, can we get a book sized version of this next?

I will buy the upgraded version when it includes s-pen and looks and has similar specs as my Note 20 ultra.

How much are these?

Lol I want it 😂

Good for mobile gaming

That&#39;s a tablet not a phone

Watching it on my iPhone 12 pro max

Galaxy Fold 😘

Give me gaming phone 😭😭🙏🙏🙏

Does this have a embedded spen

Reminder  of the days when i cared about phone specs and developments.

I swear if iphone 13 dont fold im switching to samsung its mad disappointing that there not being this innovative :(

Can it be split screen or is it just a phone with a bigger screen? I’m trying to be able to get the work tablet and phone capability in one device….

Tru that,the galaxy fold is the future,it might even be a replacement note device,that device is a bad mofo,I never under estimate samsung,Samsung, could remain its own fold brand or be a foldable note,either way,I&#39;m in,I have a galaxy fold,not as fragile as people made it out to be,I love this device,pure luxury,w a price to match,no other device like it thats a phone.

😑.  Just a poor kid here😕

Wow with that money u can buy a bad ass gaming computer. Now apple wants to compete and there selling there new fold phone for 4000 dollars compare Samsung new fold phone for 2000 dollars, man I rather buy a gaming computer.

If a box in a box in a other box and then the phone

Samsung is good man

RIP HEADPHONE JACK

The black ops 2 roll away tablets are next.

The case tho XD

It&#39;s weird because it could be too big for  texting and too small for texting at the same time . I don&#39;t want to take a tablet with me but I don&#39;t want to navigate on small screen. 🤪🤪

The only thing thats gonna stay folded is my wallet

How will a case or screen protector work???

Need me a family pack of tho&#39;s.. Kool, and it&#39;s better then buying a laptop or computer or jus a new phone. From what eye can c. This is the phone 4, me. Or u. Lol

Samsung is crazy wow that&#39;s fantastic I like the galaxy fold

Wo wow 😳 too much for me sorry I am 💩

Ibicnysgi

I can’t believe this is a thing. This is what we’ve come to.

So  you can share it into two phones?

Honestly this video was so entertaining to watch. . . I love the aspect of seeing something new. .. thank you for this unboxing . . . I am shocked at how far technology has come. . .

TT

Imagine fomsing your phone and it breaks.

Those were the days before Corona.

<a href="">1:44</a>

I can still fold my phone the difference is that its only once

The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy  really exist. It looks same.

Red would be nice, or violet

If i was not buying a house this year, I&#39;d get that.

Hey❤

کم سعر

This was I want before I find Surface Go...

I enjoyed the music in the video used to test the sound, what song was that

So how what’s the case for this phone?

Nice mobial

I hope to see future Folding phones being able to dock on keyboards (like the 2 in 1 laptops) making it one device for everything and of course containing windows home as well. (May be in 3 year&#39;s time I suppose)

What is the cost of this phone?

This phone reminds me of Nokia e90

Rollable phones?

Great

Holy shit apple users its a prototype. Stop choking on your shit when you see how bad it is.

How much

Whats the name of the music?

Unless you’re able to run high performance software on it, it probably won’t replace a laptop. But for the average user all that would mean was being able to play good games, so it could cut into laptop sales a bit with improvement.

That’s cool as shit. Too bad it’s OS is clunky to me. I don’t like Samsung’s OS. But the phone is cool as fuck. I might have to try one out at a store or something. I use my phone so much it would be useful.

Hate this phone! 👎🏻👎🏻 iPhone is better!

what about gameing

I WOULD PAY 2000 DOLLARS FOR THE SAMSUNG FOLD PHONE. IT A PHONE AND A TABLET IN ONE. ITS WORTH IT. YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING ON IT. USE IT AS A TABLET.👍 USE IT AS A PHONE. 👍 EXCELLENT.  THANK YOU SAMSUNG .🤝🤝🤝

I WANT THAT PHONE👍

How many is that phone or like unboxing phone?

축하합니다! 당신은 한국어 댓글을 찾았어요!

Indian money bataye pl

Samsung: “We just developed the first ever foldable phone!”Flip phones: “ Am I A jOkE tO YoU “

Imagine flipping it the wrong way by accident

Wasted of money it&#39;s will brake soon they do not making any case for it yet

PWEDE BA KITANG MAGING NINONG

Seems like it that couldn&#39;t last long

Samsung: Apple will never do this we are superior!Apple: Hold my beer

Absulotly amazing, The phone of the future, Samsung starting to open up a gap from Apple.Just put note 10+ with the fold options and you got everything that you need.

what is cost in indian please say

Tilipfpvcwbxjivck

Imagine picking face scanner lr idk then u just left ur foldable phone and tablet for like 5 months cos u have many gadgets and u dont need it and u reached puberty and ur face changed and when u try to unlock it OOOF u cant

Gonna do some hard work to hopefully get this masterpiece.

Can you give me one

This phone companies releasing all this FLIP design again, should consider using separate screen or 2 screen display as 1, and not a single foldable screen its not as promising

That phone maybe have only 5 in the world but my dad have one he buy for 2200$ ?

Just who likes Iphones? The new Sumsungs well better, The Quality is like walking in to paradise and Iphone quality is just like <b>CRAP</b>

Cool phone

Jhope BTS use this phone

How long is the batttry last for

I want the galaxy fold note when it comes out!

...and all of this for the low low price of $2000...

I hope some company removes a folding phone which is at a more affordable price

If Samsung doesn&#39;t exist, South Korea also doesn&#39;t exist.

Nintendo 3Ds XXXXXL

Can ai have some phone please

but will it play fortnite

80s to the 2000s phone companies trying to make the slimmest smallest phone, move onto the 2020 and we are making them as big and fat as possible lol

Looks like a 2000s remote so thick😂 I’m dreaming about a quadruple folding phone from clamshell to tablet size. This is an evolutionary start.

Good noob 😂

I prefer the mate expensive

Looks amazing! Would love to get this one

Nice gimmick that will break after a while of folding

People interested: this is so amazing! I need itFlip phone: am I a joke to you?

Sar aap koi bhi phone ka unboxing karte ho to kya mujhe vah phone unboxing karne ke liye aap De Payenge FIR main vah Phone ko Wapas Usi adress per bhejunga Jis per aap bhejne ke liye bolenge

Is there any phone case for this😅

I hope Apple and Samsung are friends

I carry an affordable and  foldable laptop in my bag and it doesnt cost a fortune.

Who need a phone like this? Complete ##€€&amp;-+! Lol

I&#39;m late but what ever folds will wear out. I wonder whats the life of the screen opening and closing.

It looks great but when is used as a phone it&#39;s screen is too small. I think they should have made it bigger.

Has it already been 10 months from launch

wearing skinny jeans and carrying this is out of the question.

Ever notice mobile phones came on the scene they were HUUUGE So to be cooler they made them smaller &amp; smaller then invented the flip phone in the 90&#39;s... But we wanted more to do with our phone we wanted to watch videos... wanted to make videos...wanted to edit videos... wanted to watch movies we wanted to text, email, surf the Web, so now phones were getting thinner and thinner and wider and wider and now they have to fold them again😛🤷🏻‍♂️Go figure...One day they will implant them in our bodies... and there will be mobile screens all around us we can take cast and use to enjoy our devices... but won&#39;t actually need the screens to own...😏🤔😌😎🤷🏻‍♂️

How did you get the fast brick

wow

He will only watch his own videos on every mobile

<a href="">3:05</a> You can do that too?! Samsung, I&#39;m impressed🤭Edit: <a href="">3:59</a>And that?! My mind is blown

Samsung is just waiting for apple to come out with a foldable phone just so they can sue them

I&#39;m really enjoying the comment sectionApple vs Samsung

He wasn’t subscribed to himself

Perfect for a gamer office workers 😂

God technology always be making the impossible possible, I remember when phone companies were trying so hard to make a fold smartphone and failed and failed and they finally got it, so fucking mind blowing

I literally only just found out this is a thing and wtf. This is AMAZING!

Wheres your non face videos gone?!?!?

Wait, so when u play roblox, is the jump button on the tablet perspective or the phone perspective or both?

ㄱㅜㄱㅃㅗㅇ   ㅋ ㅑ

Does Conor McGregor your sibling  ?

Very nice I need one

Why i think that my s10 is looking more nicer than this fold phone?

galaxy fold or note 10 Star Wars?

Where my Nintendo fans at thinking it&#39;s a 3ds

Samsung and Motorola went into foldable smartphones. Razr has most experience in foldable phones and Samsung has more experience in smartphone mfg.

Waiting for apple to match this! Ughhhhhhhhhh

Finally the galaxy dlof

Should have said: Samsung Galaxy Fold Un-folding. Missed a great pun.

I wanna see you in compact mode, landscape view watching YouTube

You know what’s terrible? Phone Prices, Nor All Of ‘Em.

Motorola razr is better

Can you give me that phone please?Because my phone is old

Bro im so happy and greatful my friend is giving me a Samsung Fold for Christmas, im just so greatful bro.

And everyone said flip phones were dead

fuck

It&#39;s cool but who wants to pay $2,000 for a phone

$2000 because three boxes. Over done

🤯😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ God Bless Samsung!!!! Take my money!!!! The future is here !

That&#39;s innovation and the overrated iphone just added a third camera when Samsung did that a year ago

How many times can you flip it open and close before there&#39;s a permanent crease in the middle

Now you have a tablet :)..but a very expensive one

Someone mind giving me an honest difference between this and my new Note 10+... I love my Note but this... DAYUM

&quot;This phone is so expensive!&quot;<b>slides out six more likes its nothing</b>

It would look way better if the screen of the &quot;phone&quot; was fullscreen

Please Do the unboxing of Escobar fold 1. :)

I will never get this bs just gay a big phone

2009 flip phones -  You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me. ...

<b>Spends 2 months of rent on a phone</b>

Well buddy you removed the screen protector now the phone will break after 1 day and you blamed the company well it is there fault becouse they didnt put a warning to not remove that

Why he is looking right side and talking ......

Lmfao Apple could never

Poor lefties

Please give me a phone

😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳

Are u giving the extra phones away?

Poor phone case makers

iPhone users 🚶🏾‍♂️

They coulda made the folding part plastic and the actually flat screen glass-

My wallet has started folding in many different ways now that I got this folding phone.

This coment section has me rolling 🤣

Can I have one??

Never mind , gonna wait for an ifold.

1900 bucks for a phone? Where can we get it?

Easy to fold....Hard to effort

The clapper try it out

Nice

Mobile app developer :Stay in corner,Try not to cry,Cry harder 😭😭

the problem with this is a kid can just snap it

I&#39;m so excited for black Friday

I waiting Samsung Galaxy Fold X(10)Size like a S9+ in closeSize like a 2 S9+ together in openQuality in YouTube screen only 144p to 1080p&amp;Storage is &quot;24GB RAM&quot; &amp; &quot;560GB ROM&quot;That&#39;s it.

All these technology, insane price, compromising durability and just a 7.3 inch screen! What a disappointment. My cheap but durable phone has a 6.5 inch screen.

As an IPhone user this is lowkey cool

For a second I thought I should buy it and than I look into my pocket.

Imagine having some anime tits as the wallpaper for this

See I’d ditch my iPhone for this.

here i am trying to buy the s10plus .. and then i see this.. i was woh? 😱😱😱

&quot;Sitting on the couch, phone to the face in an uncomfortable position&quot;I feel attacked right now. How did he know I&#39;m doing that?

I might get a samsung galaxy note 10 for my birthday 1like = higher chance

I don&#39;t like it. Microsofts Surface Duo looks more promising

Review the new razor phone

Finally, for the first time in about 12 years I can now dramatically clamp my phone shut at the end of phone calls

Wasn’t that one of those flip phones from like 20 years ago with a screenI am actually wondering where the phone industry going like 5 years in the future we will be having brick phones but with a screen

Other companies are going to focus on that middle strip that is foldable. Then the creation of foldable phones or roll-up phones will take place then T.Vs then the watch that is like paper will be rolled into your skin to be part of your wrists

WTF this is dope. Why didn&#39;t I hear about it

How do you make a case for that?

People have so many question when it come to sumsung phone... when it comes to apple eveyone is like wooo something new and they have nothing new 🤷‍♀️why ?

OMG where did you get that i want one

If you are doing something on the tablet and have to fold it to take a call, is what you were doing on the tablet saved?

I originally thought this was dumb, but now I need one.

For 200$ its ok...maybe after 10 years from now.Reviewer if you like buy it for yourself dont try to force people that is cool to buy this for 1900$.For the same money you can buy a watch that will last for ever than this junk that in 3-5 years you will put just to a storage...So personally i dont like it.Smartphones and tablets under 150$ do the same things.

Just wait for the next generation, these will be cheap.

Who does he always turn to look at?. Who&#39;s he talking to us or &quot;them&quot;?.

That’s basically a small tablet lol

Very cool but I’d never use it. I’m more of a fan of the New Razr

IPhone user : &quot;ewww you have android  the androids are so slow and so dumbMe shows her galaxy fold Also me :What you was saying ?

Not gonna lie, I’m normally an iPhone girl all day long.... but I want this

Can I get the Galaxy Samsung phone

Can i can I get

One word: Pointless.

Dude you talk to much. Just get to the point???

The letter &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; on The package looks like something that is in a color blindness test!

Normal people:Samsung British people: sAmSON

What about the cases 🤔

Yo got a flip phone

Next top seller foldable iphone

It’s like a DS but a phone

Nice

Android lol no thanks !!

Now samsung better than apple

Is this better than the razer phone

It’s crazy how many dumbasses there are in the comments shaming people for being poor for getting an android phone.

What if u want a CASE

This is rlly stupid

What if u want a case

Classically has $14,000 laying on the table

Can you break it in half and give the other half to your friend? If not then it sucks

I wonder how the phone case will look or work

Honestly this is way better than apple phones they are the same thing this is an actual change forSamsung  not to mention it comes with the earphones too !!! This is honestly WAY BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11 this is the future

What about the phone case

This the best thing since the iPod came out 🤷🏽‍♂️

They made a new 3ds

<a href="">0:13</a>  yoooooo that cover is trippy as!!!

what the shit

The most coolest device known to mand

I can just imagine it hitting the sidewalk and its game over.

Yah phone ka name kya

This entire video is edited.

didnt they stop making these?

Glorified flip phone

too bad is not full.screen

if you only knew

I just got one today but I m sending it back. It is a nice phone but you can’t really justify the price tag on it. Furthermore, it is a really heavy phone and I work wearing scrubs it would fall out of my pocket all the time.

I imagine it should be painful to repair it

We want an affordable phone not a foldable phoneLike if u agree

I want that phone

Life Hack!Buy an iPad mini

Why would one want to fold their phone??

What about a case? 😂

just wait till you drop it and break your screen.... uh sorry sir, but this screen can’t be replaced.

Does that phone come with head?? Cause that&#39;ll be the only way I pay bout 2 gz for a phone on god.

I think its useless

Great job samsung! All i can say is wow effect 😂💯😍

It reminds me of the Nokia 9110 if my memory serves me right...

Next generation of flip phones

$3000AUD/$2000USD For this piece of garbage is just ludicrous and ridiculous. The front display is tiny as well.Definitely not worth the price.

How much is this....???

That looks insane

Can I have one of you samples!!!!!!

For that price I&#39;d build a PC instead of buying this.

Where do u get the other colours. Can I buy one colour from u?

Hey does it have a pin on the phone Galaxy folder

Samsung: &quot;Put a case on this one peasants.&quot;

What’s the big deal? It’s just a touch screen DS flip phone.

i think its expensive but i understand why, its a tablet and phone in one, I would by this if I had enough money, some people may disagree but I think its worth it

i never knew this was a thing tf

Plz give link for this phone buy bro

Where is the sim slot on the galaxy fold?

I was really more surprised by these videos

I like it

Do I need to open each time I use my phone? This is stupid.

We had this in the 90s children! They were called flip phones!  All you had to do was flip them open but they didn&#39;t have youtube or google but they did have snake

A fuking pokedex

how will phone chases work with that lmao

Wow!!! Price $ucks though :/

Damn apple step up your game

Howd much they pay you for you to hype this phone that much 😂😂😂 we want a real review from your perspective dude.

Come make note fold. It is even better, say goodbye to book, good bye to tree cutting.

Sir ji price

So I believe you will be giving these out. Here is my address. Thank you for your humble donation.Signed, Broke person.

Nice specs and technology surely samsung mind blowing love it

Cool! 😍

The slim side looks disgusting ..looking like a home phone..even the tablet&#39;s square shape looks nasty..and wayy too many cameras lol..so unnecessary..it looks like something from the 90s

How are you going to play games?

How much ?

so pretty much, it&#39;s the better version of a DS?

2009 - wow I don&#39;t need to fold my phone2019 - wow I can fold my phone now :)

The fold should have made the phone part a little bit bigger

im samsung fan.. but this one is ugly.. good as idea.. i dont like the line in the middle.... but its good idea if samsung will work on it next edition will be great.... I got anyway S10+ Ceramic black with 1TB im super happy..

How much does that cost?

When unfolded it&#39;s too wide and not handy when closed it&#39;s too narrow 🤣🤣

Mine wouldn’t charge and got very hot!!!! RETURN!!!!!!

Why most ppl say it&#39;s hard to make a phone case for the phone ?? it&#39;s like asking how to make a cover for a book ..

Cool but still wouldn’t buy it😂

Sikecem bu dezer reklamimi yeter agym ya

This is the future of smartphones :)

....

Woow

I’ma stick with my 3ds

So no built in kick stand to watch movies or YouTube?

Lol

Question answered 1 minute later lol!!!

How do they eliminate the fold line??????

So when are you unboxing your hair? No one’s ever seen it

Omg The Samsung Fold is Awsome Really really want that phoneIts beautiful I&#39;m awe if itGimmie .. Gimmie .. GIVE ME !!!

Incredible. From an apple/iphone user

Try it n games to see how it looks.

U number?

lets be real they are just a b-tech DS

...breaks when u blow on it?

Can i have one any one ? Plz 😢👍😋

My concern is, what kind of cover we gonna get for this phone?

Sir how mouch prize aaudi arabic

Hybrids are becoming the new trend in technowlegy

This phone looks FORMIDABLE !!!Like a WoW experience !!!I loved the BLACK and Royal Blue Varian👍Need to check all TECH Specs.

How many rs

Anyone else watching this on the Samsung fold ?

Folded up that shit about as skinny as an LG Chocolate.

went here after the alleged issue of the &quot;new and fixed&quot; Galaxy Fold

I swear you make me want to buy things I never even wanted

I prefer nokia g3310

if you want a bigger screen, why not get a tablet instead?

I wish i was able to buy one but until then oh well

Dope for Android Auto

I love it

i hate tablets

sweet ill wait 4 years and buy it when its like 150 ...... thanks dude

Give me a stylus and im sold in

How do you like them apples.?

<a href="">2:57</a> I got a notification on my phone at the same time you got one 😂😂😂

Needs dual screen functionalityVery disappointed in Samsung

Flip phone is back again

I heard that if u put a credit card or a magnet, it might break. Sure it’s portable but not need for this if you have a phone. Not hating just saying.

Samsung has the BEST hardware... but really bad software.Apple has the best software.BUT SAMSUNG’S NEW THING IS NICE

Uselessness intensifies

I wish they or anybody could get their email and calendars to sync and function right

Imagine after hitting the bar on a typical Friday night and folded it in the wrong direction.....

I would have very much liked to have it if the smaller display was bigger than that. When there is foldable phone with the smaller display the size of a normal ~6&quot; phone with the added bonus of foldability, I&#39;ll want it.

Just get I Pad or Samsung Tablet, you will save money :D

How would you put a case on that thing, or a screen protector?

Finally a phone that is fall-in-the-toilet proof

I&#39;m more than happy with my S8

I&#39;ve been wanted to ask you, but please don&#39;t be offended; are you &amp; Stonemountain64 related? He&#39;s a youtuber as well! You guys kinda look alike &amp; sound exactly the same! To me &quot;He is to video games; as you are to tech!&quot;

well it&#39;s not bad

Streets of rage

I like galaxy fold

Is Superman

Really nice darling

It&#39;s like a reverse flip phone. You close it to talk instead of opening it.

Can i trade my samsung galaxy tab a for this??!!  PLS I NEED TO KNOW

davai abminaemsa tvoi fold maiom galaxy s10+

Only thing bigger than the phone is the price.  TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS!  Chump change.  Only a chump would spend that much change, on a phone!

He&#39;s trash

Super Cool 🖒📲👏

That box looks more expensive than my phone

Flip that thing halfway open and use it as a baby laptop.

This is so dope 😍

Thats much better than iphone 11

Oh wow, a flip phone!

You’re very annoying with the ohohohoh then the chuckle, had to cut u off

How&#39;s the battery life?

It’s ugly

How much is it🤔

once they said Motorola Sidekick would be the Future....

If they put in a stylus in it like the note! I&#39;ll buy this even if it was $2,000

This shit looks asss, ima stick with iPhone. Fuck this fake ass bullshit

Foldable phones like Huawei mate X can be made half a glass half plastic, where the glass transfers at the edge to plastic and can be opened. The plastic part can be protected by cower when not used. Must be outwards opened like mate x.

Faltu

6 cameras damn

this isn’t really a future. It’s impractical and really expensive. Would be nice if the small screen was bigger

Samsung 2000 dollar phone can I put a case on it or a cheapppp Screen protecter All phone in general hold my basic Design

Hey Hello, good developer, this application is a problem to access the YouTube account, it does not let me do it because of possible program error because when I want to post comment on YouTube it does not allow me to access my account That is possibly a mistake that needs to be modified  why I have that problem and does not want to access me

،I&#39;m waiting for the Note version of this phone.&#39;

Anybody reconize the old look and the new look like the different

oooh Samsung is at apples neck! In my opinion their both good phones!

No Samsung pencil ?

Probably in a few years when foldable phones will be the norm, the aspect ratio for videos will be back to 4:3.

who else came back?

Fold

Wow we are literally going to back to when phones came on the scene. Lol, how large are cell phones going to get eventually people will be  carrying around a whole house phone 🤣🤣🤣

Do another review of this one but the new version which is just an update

2000:&quot;iPhone&quot;2020:&quot;iAMthePhone

I find the whole box inside of another box inside of yet another box to be a bit unnecessary. Then again, with the Fold&#39;s hefty price point, one box simply wouldn&#39;t suffice. 😑I think it looks stupid in smartphone mode with the 4.7&quot; screen.

Flip phone

Kind of obsessed with getting one now that I’ve seen this Hope they get the bugs out soon

Gorgeous!Just gorgeous

It&#39;s mostly a tablet

Eww i dont like it

OMG I&#39;m obsessed with phone. My mind is blown. I haven&#39;t gotten excited for phone or something technological in so long.

For the price of two Macbook AIR

I see clearly two phones

Where is the hydraulic press channel when you need them.

So you’re buying a tablet?

As an iPhone user though, these unreasonable stupid fucking dumbers don&#39;t deserve this gadget.

Apple wya 😂 remake this 🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽

iPhone users hate this until iPhone adds this to it&#39;s phone.

If only he knew ....

تحياية للعرب جميع😂🤞

Apple: Crap phone dont sell no more because it broke to much 😭😭🤣🤣✌🏽

Flip 🖕for all of you

guy from 2019: this is the &quot;future&quot;people from the 90&#39;s: wtf is this man talking about?

Phone case company:<b>confused screaming</b>

Wow finally I can make some corn tortillas with that

Apple catch the fuck up

I just feel like Samsung needs to change their font or something. The phone is beautiful its just still a little ehhhh to me.

That notch doesn’t annoy me In the slightest

YASSSSSSS

The outside screen is too small. Other than that the phone is perfect. Imo this is first a tablet then a phone because of the small screen when closed. If they enlarge the outside screen when closed Apple is crushed.

They should do this but with a switch

Nintendo was already way up ahead of everybody with the DS holy sh*t

Muy gordote

I think it’s useless

Uhhhhhhhhh its fake

<a href="">1:51</a>

Never had iPhone never will Samsung is the shit!

Samsung=south korean’pride

Nice do slat slat

Dam after wile nobody gona have a dam phone if tbey gt up to 50,000 ltr dam i thought it was just about gettong a hold of a mf 🤣

This is a game changer right here!!!! Apple eat your hart out they wish came up with this!!

캬 국뽕에 취한다 &gt;, &lt;~!!

Amazing🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭

samsung betri tak tahan lah liau.....

$14,000 on the table at the end? Lol

Do you know which s pens work for it?

What&#39;s the song name at <a href="">9:24</a> ?

I WAS HOPING YOU GONNA OPEN THAT BLACK ONE

I love how excited you were when using it and how much optimism you had when they recalled it.

Soooo it&#39;s a new age flip phone. A horizontal sidekickesque phone. I think this is perfect for a gamer

Not that good tbh

can u give one to me HAHA

Superb! @GalaxyFold

Samsung: <b>Fold</b> my beer

boring phone to be honest lol

I really want it but you can still see a crease

Talk about now officialy released Samsung Galaxy Fold

This phone costs as much as my first car. Pretty cool though.. I’ll wait for the price to drop idk.. $1500? 😂😂😂

Try again

Finally, a tablet that I can take around with me

Galaxy will be the first to make the transparent smartphone

FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅

Waaait didn&#39;t the trailer just come out?

Who’s here after Samsung  release the official trailer of the Samsung galaxy fold?

Did the screen break yet?

Anyone here after the Official Release of the Galaxy Fold?

It looks top noch device and big step with display technology but I suppose bigger screen will require people hogging on to chargers everywhere to watch another episode of whatever.Sadly they do not make batteries to last long.I have had Galaxy S7 for few years and I can not be bothered upgrading the phone for any newer one?What for?

My question is, how do you make a case for that thing?

all i need a wireless device without touching it

not much interested as before 4G phones

Who&#39;s here waiting for the new Galaxy Fold video to drop?

Excellent.

Galaxy fold is finally out on public in Korea.

I love the concept and this truly is the future, but it needs to be much thinner, have straight edges instead of beveled and needs to be almost half the price. Whoever pulls that off first gets my business.

I think since it folds the folding film will wear out

Foldable Casing and foldable screen protecter ? Whoever invented it will start earning money.

Before I said I didn&#39;t like this device but after all of the other releases this year this might best the most interesting and I honestly would rather pay for this although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the asking price but I rather spend the $2000 plus for this and get the mini tablet for my football watching and Hulu shows than to pay $1100 for the note that offers the same viewing experience as the S10

This type of galaxy will lose, no one likes this The screen in one side is too small

Basically a touch screen fliphone

How do u make a case for that

WHAT? $1,900... Fuck you😖

&quot;This is the real future, I&#39;m convinced!&quot; Well it is a shame that the future lasted all of 6 days :(

I like the video but not a fan of the phone..... here&#39;s to seeing the Apple iFold later this year....

🐙

Am i the only one who finds the camera part annoying on the bigger screen? (Like 5% of the display is taken) hit like if you do too!

Was wondering how do i fix a screen protector on that phone and definitely i will not be able to get fancy covers for that phone.... so its a NO for me....either u get a proper phone or a tablet.

Give me one ,😅😁🤪

Lou, are you wearing makeup in this video? Especially mascara?

@ <a href="">5:23</a> that&#39;s my comment scrolling thanks Lew !

Samsung Just WOW this is amazing

disaster for ecology

nice phn

This pfone as soon as“BOMB！”

Throw a pen in it and I’m sold lol

That be dope if you can pull the phones apart with out it breaking

<b><a href="">0:01</a></b> his hand geez

Wow! nice unboxing video Unbox Therapy! Wish my oakley unboxing video was as good as this😕

it was fun while it lasted RIP galaxy fold 2019-2019

If you fold it from normal, it looks like a tablet with a small display

Apple: introducing the i pad mini Samsung : hold my beer

Best phone for the Porn on the Way 😂😂

So that screen protector wasnt one aparrently. It was a part of the phone? Idk im confuses

But I kinda like the normal phone with 6.3 inch series

I NEED ONE

Where do you buy this phone online?

Amazing

What ifYou folded the other side?

it just reminds me of the old Nokia phones, the design is the worst, maybe the tech is the best, but the design !!!!!!!!! WTF

Seriously that&#39;s a big waste of money and that&#39;s not even a phone that&#39;s a fucking tablet !

Technology is doing all kinds of good things for me 🤤

This is my dream phone and it&#39;s not stupidly priced like that £20,000 phone😉

Cant even imagine what will happen it is dropped by chance

Gimme one bruh

U basically bought an ipad/ tablet and a phone in one

I never thought they would actually do this

<a href="">1:51</a>galaxy fold: Am i a joke to you?

This is one ugly device

Yo why does he have the European plug in? I thought he was from the US

galaxy fold is revolution.

😍📱👌

The just took ZTE&#39;s Axon M, and upgraded it.

Phone case mnufacturers will waste alot of money to make these cases and for their beta tests

can you use that for gaming?

Wait til you get dirt and dust on the phone and you fold it and scratch it to hell, and good luck finding a case or screen protector

It’s ugly, and this doesn’t seem futuristic to me. I’m not impressed at all. NEXT

seems cool until you realize you bought a folding phone because you’re a ducking worthless knob

Needed the s pen

best ohone

After seeing what normal smartphones are offering, I have to get a future version of this. Probably a galaxy fold 4 or 5

I like your videos very much and if I want to buy electronics things  I will see your videos

Okay den here’s some lava music

Bigger batteries and octagon processors

Wow that is a really awesome phone!

Worst of samsung

Wish it was less expensive, seems like it would be awesome to have day to day

For $2000 I expect this level of presentation in the retail packaging in September

Flip phone: am I a god damn joke to you? AM I A GOD DAMN JOKE TO YOU!?!

Did anyone notice that the hands from the close-up shots switch from time to time?

So mini mini mini mini tablet that folds in half. Got it

Have u had any of the problems and recalls they have been talking about with the galaxy fold

Where can I buy this ?

Imagine you already have the Galaxy Buds

Want it

It&#39;s got alot of nice tech but almost 2g is way to much....get real yo

plz. give me one

Everyone is complaining about price but apple stand, and products were always overprice, this is a flagship beast of a phone with 12 gigs of ram...

This lowkey sucks though. Like the idea sounds good on paper, but this thing seems so extra.

Didn’t even savor the peelies

Can I have that Samsung fold I live in the Philipines😢😢😢😢

Great video... I&#39;m getting one

That there is the definition of unnecessary luxury.

I want. Send me one. Haha.

I want this, but it’s expensive as fuk

Hey xan u gibe away some gadgets hahah joke ya heheeh

I mean that&#39;s really cool, but that frickin&#39; price tag, jesus.

super

Bhavesh Sahu you do

Screens going to end up splitting or just from use watch a line down the center a clarity issue will happen from wear or something.

Fixed fold is gonna be the future. Samsung does it again

Does it work with a stylus pen?

Can I have one? Lol

Sou brasileira. Entendi nada mas amei o video

If it didn’t have cameras inside it’d look better &amp; a better outer screen i would buy

What&#39;s the actual difference between a Galaxy folded and a more upgraded Galaxy Tablet?! Save your unfolded wallet People of YouTube. Haha!

한국어 번역좀여

next time they should make a phone with a desktop gpu strapped to the back and call it a &quot;portable pc&quot;

But still no s-pen 😲

Samsung Galaxy fold

size of that screen on the front bothers me.

This is getting out of hand, Now there are two of them!

Just one I want one

i hope you can Gift me one in my Birthday, Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks

Samsung galaxy fold: worlds first foldable phone!2006: am i a joke to you?

Will be interesting to see how reliable it is.

of the galaxy fold unfolding

Phone cases companies: give us something like alien technologySamsung: hold my beer please

Have we gone full circle with flip phones???

I will wait till an bigger screen version comes

Honestly I really don&#39;t know why everyone&#39;s hating this has been requested by many people for a while so they gave it to you and now everyone&#39;s pissed, yes it&#39;s expensive but so is the apple stand🤣

Something like this with Windows 10 in it would be sick. You would allways have your Mini Laptop with you, to run pc Applications

in the second iteration of this fold. they should make the front screen take up the whole front of the screen. as of now on this device, there is a whole lot of black around it.

Flip phones: am I a joke to you?

Public transit? If you see someone in public transit with this phone, they should have probably invested in a car instead of this phone. LMAO.

wish this went better for samsung by far best designed foldable phone

Ok take my damn money now!!

Forget the phone case. That&#39;s easy compared to the screen protector..😳

I’m still waiting to buy one.

It’s like a 3ds

thats soooo stubid and disappointing phone , and i thought folded phone will b smaller then i surprisingly find it as big as a tab , y the hell should someone buys a phone that big

Is it released in London or anywhere in the UK

I don&#39;t like koria.

jeez man 14 grand sitting on that table

I miss snapping close phones with keyboards

Oh how I love new technology

Y&#39;all comments are so lame

now imagine dropping that.

Samsung: apple has an ugly notch ew we will make fun of apple nowAlso Samsung: <b>adds notch to Samsung fold</b>

Which watch is he wearing?

1900 USD to PHP is 98,088.45 so expensive!

All I see on that table is a waste of money and all of you peasants in the comments section should see the same. Only peasants buy new useless gadgets. My phone literally cost me $30 and it does everything those phones do. Talk text internet Netflix YouTube Instagram. the only reason anyone ever buys these useless things is to impress the person next to them.  let me tell you something no one&#39;s impressed because nobody cares ,Only insecure people care about what others have. You want to be rich and successful stop buying useless gadgets you can&#39;t afford.

Silly peasants buying new phones to make these companies Rich while keeping yourself poor. Working a nine-to-five job having a monthly bill to pay off that new phone silly peasant.

Now you will pay us more money, when you smash the front and back and inside of the phone and you trust me, it will happen:)

My main question is if it can play fortnite... if you said yes like if you said no comment

nokia n90

samsung galaxy tab s6

Ok next is gonna be galaxy paper. After that, you will have yourself a galaxy implant.

What would the cases be like

Now it&#39;s got to much pop up ads in which obvious they obviously don&#39;t care if it&#39; get you killed in an accident

Doesn&#39;t even have a stylus.

Your lucky bro...lets be honets galaxy Gold even better..

Galaxy fold should have a slightly bigger screen when folded because it looks awkward, I know the main gimmick is when its unfolded but seriously make it a bit bigger. The price I honestly think if they want to succeed and make it a success is drop the price just a bit by like 200 bucks at the very least. And Jesus Samsung for the love of God include a case that actually protects it. It is still a neat idea and I shall still am considering it.

so like now when you go buy your tv there in a compact box and you just unfold it and stick it to the magnetic mounts on the wall

Most

THIS IS THE FUTURE!!!

Yep , just a piece of trash

I don&#39;t know your age,but when i saw Clint Eastwood i remembered my past time when i was watching his western movies in 1980th.........

Awesome 😊💜

I see a dead pixel

It is foldable, but the middle part of the screen is made of plastic

Who came here to find that meme?😂😂

Is it available for T-Mobile?

Is this guy transitioning into...mexican?

We&#39;re back to the flipping phones! I&#39;d rather invest in a car

how to make a iphone foldstep one: tape two iphone x togetherstep 2: done

Didn’t we already made phones that flip? Wasn’t it called the flip phone?

The hates comes from (🤢&quot;IOS FANS&quot;🤮)

Old spice

LoL I am korean so I can&#39;t understood some part in video without sub :pHow much is galaxy fold?

I was kinda hoping that you would just buy a Samsung tablet then snap it in half.

Wow

Mine only lasted 6 days .-. It broke

If anyones brother/sister wants a phone make a half of it

Wow!Awesome,man.This is my own moment.

Apple: My phones are expensiveSamsung: fold my beer

I want to see a point I. Getting this but I don’t.

Too small

Damn. 1980 tho... Geez....

Imagine if you break the screen?🤧

Flip phone: Who are you?Galaxy fold: I&#39;m you but stronger.

Clash Royale? No problem! 😂

That&#39;s grotesque.

It cost more to replace the screen guard as it&#39;s large

Oh, okay, but do you have my IPhone XS max?

Hello sir u r making awesome  video i like u n sir if u don&#39;t mind can u give one foldable phone please

They need to make the mini screen a galaxy s10 screen, then I&#39;m sold.

Yeah i don&#39;t got that type of money😂rather just get myself a flip phone

Throws iPhone x I am getting that Galaxy fold

Galaxy Fold: <b>*exists*</b>Flip phones: Am I a joke to you?Laptops: Am I a joke to you?

For the price of the fold you could just get a tablet and a phone

Public transit... you got me fucked up if u think ima be using that shit in shady places 😂😂😂

Mate x

Wow the new flip phone

This is better than getting iPad for sure

Wow This is so cool!!!I want to buy it.. 😭😭😭😭😭😭

I can’t wait until Apple prefect it and make it even better.

The 14k dislikes were probably from Apple users

Is it just me or does he sound hella Philly?

I&#39;m happy with my OnePlus 7 pro. Best smart phone ever.

pretty stupid it’s a 7 inch screen when it’s unfolded that’s only 2 inches more than average phones

The concept is reminiscent of the Nokia Communicator series.  I&#39;ve been waiting for which manufacturer to do it in the 21st century...

Fplding phone 2k USDVirtual Reality under $500 And people call VR an expensive gimmick haha. The thing is people will buy this and not complain because its a phone.

Cases for that?

It doesn&#39;t seem that Galaxy fold is practical.

No need for this phone!! I have never needed nor wanted one!! Great video tho!!

anyone noticed the huge notch ?

Can you danlowd fortnite

I want samsung galaxy x

6 cameras?

Garbage phone 🤭🤣

Sorry samsung but apple beat you they invented the bendable phone years ago 😂

It&#39;s the future real talk there going to make it to a point when it&#39;s super slim super foldable

Galaxy foldable phone for 2k WHAT, ARE THEY STUPIDOh look a computer stand  that is literally a piece of metal for 1k, give me 3

Lol that screen protector that he peeled off at the beginning is supposed to stay on it at all times.

first generation is for collectors. i&#39;ll wait for a 5th or 6 generation fold

So this is a 7.3 inch screen while we now have 6.7 inch normal smartphones 🤔 just a .5 inch difference 😂

Im more of a &quot;hello&quot; &amp; &quot; goodbye&quot; kinda guy this doesn&#39;t tickle my fancy not one bit!😒

well, it&#39;s nice but can you use it to watch video when it&#39;s unfold? or use it unfold and have access to IG, FB, YouTube etc?

If you drop this phone then don&#39;t be too upset at least you still got the exterior screen.

Touch screen flip phone.

Supposedly the Galaxy Fold has a re-release of September  2019.  This was supposedly leaked by Samsung themselves.  This information was presumably discovered 7/24/2019. Let us know when you find out more.

This is sick!!!!

Amazing 😉

Peeling the protective cover will break the phone according to Samsung

Wer braucht so ein Müll ??

iPhone who?!?

Anyone else think he sounds like PIZO?

Omg I won’t that phone so bad

It is not good🙄😥🤔

It is not good🙄😥🤔

As an avid Apple user, I kinda want this.

Ok who are you taking to the audience or the crew? Acting is horrible you’re trying to hype it up but there’s no feelings and your just saying random shit about “the future”

Would love to play brawl stars on that lol

Looks good as a tablet but looks horrible as a phone lol

i wonder how to put the case

Samsung payed them to review this. If u read his discription &quot;first folding phone ive ever tryed&quot; ... But he tryed the Zte atom m in 2017.. Zte did it better than samsung hands down.

If it could fold even smaller, I’d be sold. Cute IPod shuffle lookin thing becomes a tablet before your eyes

I&#39;m sticking with my galaxy s10

Excellent, now we have twice as much screen to break when it falls

I will never be able to afford this phone unfortunately.but what I&#39;d like to know you can flip it in multiple ways but then the phone needs a screen protector and a case or is the phone non break a ble now bc I see so much glass in this phone and a huge 1900 breaking hazard.

It’s weird that no one is actually talking about the box rises the phone up like it has a motor

Not worth the price

OH YEA!!! FUCK U IPHONE USERS

Plzz You give Me This PhoneI Know You Never Give him thisBecause you Miserly....

Worlds greatest flop...

Big mistake when you took the screen protector off

I guess this is an excuse for all those really creative phone case companies to support non apple phones

Samsung: &quot;We complete first folding smartphone&quot;Huawei: &quot;Well yes but actually no&quot;

The new flipphone

Samsung: FIRST EVER FOLDABLE PHONEFlip Phone: u guys are idiots

Trash, mate x is is better.

Barock phone company is the best you are lazy

I pass

have to say that huaiwei folding design is better

...too expensive.

iPhone 10s and iPad Pro combined would ‘only’ cost you 1700 dollars... I really cannot justify the price of this Samsung fold, especially because of this super small front screen and thick hinge.

Cool

Lew unbox the mate x

😍😍😍😍😍😍

Come on iPhone lift your game , I’m waiting....

Thanos dude thanos for my brother muhammed I’m just coding and is we know coolest thing on coding is his secret also before he made me some problem because tracking me because any reason

Algum Brasileiro ai ....?

Classmates- hey man let’s watch a movie.The guy in the video- unfolds phone.Classmates- ooh

Would it be smart to just wait for the Note 10 or the Fold? I know the Fold was supposed to be released a while ago and it had some problems. I imagine its first release will have bugs. I already have an iPad, so I don&#39;t really need the Fold. I have the Note 8 right now and am still loving it. I&#39;ve been due for an upgrade for quite a while, but I&#39;ve been waiting for the Fold. After reading about the problems they had with releasing it, I became leery about getting it. I&#39;d appreciate any advice. Thank you!

My wallet will be so empty i wont be able to refill it again

Samsung to apple at the gym:yOu FoLd BrO?

我在bilibili也看你的视频

Lets hear more about your Neuman mic setup :D

Galaxy map

Maybe this i gonna say its a none sense thing bu i remember wen i have my nokia 3310 with a little green screen and i wash my clothes in a maytag neptune tl touch screen and tht was in 2002 wen even the camera wasn&#39;t introduce yet in a phone but yea a washer and dryer in tht time have a big 5 inch touchscreen

I wouldn&#39;t even buy that if I was the richest person in the world

Dude, love your reviews.

How are they making a case for this?

What is the song playing?

Does samsung pay work on the Fold??

Yeah...I’ll let apple copy this

<b>Gets extremely expensive phone accessories</b><b>PROCEEDS TO THROW THEM AT THE BOX</b>

The iPad Pro should come with airpods

Does the Samsung Galaxy Fold have a carrying case

why on earth are you look sideways both left and right whos there?

I dont like how the screen looks when its folded a lot of the top and bottom are cut off

Reminds me of my Kyocera Echo I used to have but this folds differently and obviously has way better technology.

why does his hands look so long like slender man 😭😭😭

Samsung has solved foldable phone problem

Lol you shouldn’t take the screen protector out

Lmao. Bubyeee Fold

U will notice it when u are holding it and robber comes and steal and ran with it then u will really notice it😂😂😂😂

Y’all fools for thinking this is good. It’s a tablet with a hinge

Ah yes I could almost see it now <b>Lew on the train</b> &quot;Do you like my bubble butt iPhone??&quot;

Imagine going back to 2007 and whipping this bad boy out I public. People would lose their fucking minds.

Who Else Just Wants The SIDEKICK Back ?😪

I refuse to spend money on youtube advertizers wh support YouTube&#39;s censorship of mainstream conservative values.

Oh... my... GOD...! I just became sexually aroused!

Open the dam box

I just realized that the tiny display on this phone is higher resolution than the iPhone xr

This or small form factor agumented reality. Which I really fucking want. I never want to have to sit at a desk again to do work and play games.

Wath galaxy fold

How much money

It’s funny how Apple can’t include the AirPods in the phone X series but Samsung straight up slapped galaxy buds with the galaxy fold

Phone power

저 아조시 좋아하는거 보니까 마음이 아파

Smartphones were  invented, replacing classic folding phones, now folding smartphones were invented replacing regular smartphone

I have Samsung S10 and S10plus mobile phone cases. Is there anyone who wants to be an experiencer? If you are interested, please contact me.

I really really hate that they made the screen size so damn tiny when folded. It looks retarded. Mate X looks waaaay better.

Cool😷

Nokia comunicator

If I wasn’t so self conscious I’d actually like it lol

Announcement Announcement Announcement I want to buy a iPhone 6s+ 64gb Main board Please help me.

For $1000 more you could buy a samsung fridge

Dude, stop complimenting it, they literally just made a tablet that you can fold. Also that is definitely gonna break so have fun w/ that.

I would just tear it open and see what happens.

I&#39;ll stick with my Motorola Razr V3

Here come the entitled parents.
