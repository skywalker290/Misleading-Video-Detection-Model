That sucks that I can afford a DJ like the one that does this music where able to get Justin Bieber because I’m a huge Justin Bieber fan and one of his gay fans, so it’s my sister and we both would love to meet him on my birthday on March 14. I would’ve loved to invite you guys for my birthday I travel at incredible Pizza in Texas to play arcade games with me and my family celebrate my birthday. I’m turned 34 and before I die in that seizure. I would love to meet him and Ariana Grande

Fuck this song only for Wayne&#39;s rap ❤

Don&#39;t take it seriously when I call myself the one. First of all, I&#39;m not even interested to be the one.Second, I have never seen an authentic divine sign or received a divine message claiming that claimThird, My opinion does not count, I&#39;ll be biased. We all think we are secretly Batman, making the world a better place. Who wouldn&#39;t we want to be the one either?What you guys think I am, I&#39;ll value more. Not interested in periodically alternating identification.Hope my identification is repeated consistently over a month with no variation or will need to reset for 1 month

Also because I&#39;m feeling honest and I&#39;m tipsy trying to dodge the goddamn Yakuza terrorists.  Your wife is sexy as fuck. And she&#39;s a keeper.  Just treat her right man.

Justin Bieber just know that you are real one for making this.  -Sage

6 YEARS AGO?!?!?!?!?

Same way not sonic is super sonic hynotic troc ye have none but internal flash all inner in Oliver Keating Vortex not mine I passex to match I had inner real life

Null and void exactly as stated sub 0 through the void the grid got after that figure rest yourself murder she wrote was inner

Golden gates eyes rolled slot machine inner through eyes someone else right eye left eye imculate conseption arse way reverse power don&#39;t want power give who ever u want rather be dead karma either way as cry babe empath inner

I only did him so here I&#39;m ET on my own Elaine Meaney left him his own lifee choices don&#39;t blame me if floor filla fill u negitive next kill to opposites attract

Olivers cousin to Karen my sleep alive Extraterrestrial

Cousin to my cousin which mine was sleep he must of be awake at that stage asleep when hit and took cover reminiser

I sent message to David got missed call hung up I no true

Mother pinocino inner marese liar inner what moryg ye need I&#39;m truth swallower truth a d had ti scynoised truth in head to get out all alive marry but inner truth revel and was Oliver Keating level 3 then lying down with looney and I&#39;m under them I new who was and told to stay away why ye do like that

Resident evil umbrella Keith inner I felt his presence with zap inner negitives

Banging walls 2016

I did flash my own path but did see future through path that doing so used if what to put it like that as never match anyone like said I only did 1 and told that and was no different when went birth I not using people ye did to me now I have to suffer

Floor filla 1 I&#39;d regret for rest of my life not doing or same same way I see differ like writing I have your back you have mine no mater what case may be if ye love someone is like that like u think me I think of u vice versa not one sided like stated you be there rest of life then tell me get out of you life shows me not faith in you eyes

Trough mask as wasn&#39;t my path was Faith never mind birth match was same path

Upstairs downstairs goes up above hwad from inside internal all directions not me controlling

Don&#39;t ask who&#39;s watching in this/that year....we&#39;ll always be there❤

Still watching 2024 🎉

I had to scynoise as a man in reverse I no all reversed to government still internal pyrimid never let out

Same way dark child liquid soul diving faces halo small angel was certifed Extraterrestrial like Certificate vaition but golden gates in kings of castle but Stated grandad behond gates and unlocked after done by sensing grandads picture and taking shams daughter out leave protocol go ear piece under but through Dr woods as inner then went top sham me bothttom below all

I no i was denied blessing in my head and guard was doing return to innocence like made voice included

Scarifice went all inclusive of self and after that. Death be less painful real life so as is

Sent back rights faith could have all I was controlling anyone

I no i did for love and truth for saving soul to lock ur own will not thinking inner in my ET I no all was done after that karma works both ways not me manipulated truth

Pass mother truth mother teressa mother as me scynoised truth through voice sister used all

Flying beds pased twice I don&#39;t no rest ur path

6 And the angel spake and said; and it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it. 7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots. 8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church. 9 And also for the praise of the world......Nephi chapter 13Please find the nearest church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints to you and come unto Christ, The devil is real and he is not hiding anymore.  He is trying to recruit because he wants souls in hell with him. Please, this is not the time to be in lala land. He hunts after people who are weak in spirit.This life is a time to prepare to meet God and Jesus Christ. Please wake up.
