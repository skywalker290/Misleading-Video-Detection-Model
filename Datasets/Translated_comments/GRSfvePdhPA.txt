Some guy named Oppo: <b>thinking intensifies</b>

Watching in 2023 with your first look at the Oppo Find X6 Pro.

It&#39;s a shame that it failed

I&#39;m from 2022, this phone still looks great.. 😜😜

I want one. Where do we get it in the US?I don&#39;t use the camera much or the face unlock so it&#39;s none issue but for me a screen free of stupid notches and hole punch is important.

I would&#39;ve wholeheartedly accepted motorized cameras as the next evolution in smartphone design until I went to the beach and sand would find their way into my phone. That&#39;s when I realize that hole-punch designs are fine...

So, if you were concerned about how secure the face ID was, why didn&#39;t you test it in your video to check it? 🤔 seems like a pretty smart thing to do. Too bad we&#39;ll never know since you didn&#39;t do it

Really? Way back in the day for you is a couple years ago? Smh

I thought the htc butterfly was the first 1080p smartphone?

How would you get a case for this though? My R17 gorilla glass smashed when I left it without a case for only 48 hours

I don&#39;t think Oppo found x yet

The cheerful gymnast marginally spot because pink enzymatically switch like a far john. scary, puzzling belt

Finally!, Oppo makes their own design which is so ultimate and awesome automatic selfie camera but probably most of oppo phones are copycat by copying the iphone 6 &amp; 6s or other phone brand might be not really interested about it. 😅😂

I would definitely buy it if it&#39;s name wasn&#39;t &quot;Find X&quot;

This is lighter version of what unbox therapy did to apple phone lol!!!!!!!

It looks same like samsung s10.. S10 is better than find x bcoz of weight and hardware material, UI, premium feel of UI, oppo find x is also good but that is worthy bcoz both cell phones have almost same price

This guys voice is like nails ona chalk board

Kalia bhund

.

I&#39;m using this phone right now and i have no regrets buying it

Coming back in 2020 to watch one of my favourite phone desgings in recent years! 👊🏼

Can i have this phone now

best looking design and colourway so far, cant think of a phone that looks better than this one.

Horrible for $,  design and quality I stick with Samsung and Apple

Bitches be crazy

Its funny how this concept never took off .

Price $$$

Please sir

Sir one mobile give me Please

Oppo create :find XCase manufacturers: Am I a joke to you?

I sale my kidney soonly...

I have that phone but its a fake one they called a &quot;clone&quot; Actually I&#39;m using it now. Its not that really cool. And the camera its not doing the camera motion.

Camera still pops up well in 2020

My dream mobile, God willing, I will buy it, God willing 😢💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🇪🇬
Image if this had a aluminium back instead.. Then it would be hot as hell!!!

Oppo copied  iphone&#39;s face id process
Wait, if there&#39;s a motor, isn&#39;t that gonna take up more battery life? 🔋🔋🔋

Can’t wait to find out how easily the motorized camera breaks

This phone is futuritic

Well I hate that thing

Been using the lambo edition and it&#39;s the best phone even in 2020!!!

Why did you make me do math Oppo?
who here after find x2 pro review.

I found the x! 😂😂😂

Imagine trying to put a case on it.

can you review oppo a9 2020 ?

No I will not Find X, I am done with math and you cant stop me Oppo

Can you please help me how to find the Google lense of my Oppo Find X. New update this day December 31, 2019 Please.Advance Thank you po

Sexiest phone as far as design goes.. and for that greatest mechanism.But its the worse one to own with that amount of price.... cant afford to have even a single con.Overall conclusion- a beautiful piece of junk.

Oppo: The front and back facing cameras are hidden! <b>FBI has left the chat</b>

Oppo: releases oppo find xMaths: Am I a joke to you?

Good Phone...like to change my oppo zoom in find x..

<a href="">3:50</a>What colorway of that AJ1?Is that AJ1 Mid Infrared?

Even in 2019, despite some lacking features, still a great phone ahead of its time.

The Most Beautiful Fone so far in history

so bad!!
OPPO is the hot wave since 2017 here in Algeria. Still not convinced though 🤔 to me it&#39;s just a camera phone 😗

bad design i want to showoff cameras from back not to hide them

Me in 2019: I know where the camera is... i know how it goes

The perfect gift for a math teacher

Still the best looking phone even in 2019

looks like a shitty fone

Who&#39;s watching this on a Find X?

Just bought this phone mid 2019 for under AUD$500 😱

K 20 &amp; father is oppo find x.

Wow! What a correct time to release a sequel now!!! Mkbhd you might be a good influencer to get the company attention!!!!

Bordo... red...Bordered...🤯
Still no phone to match this beauty 🔥👌

<a href="">6:01</a>“ so at the end of the day” it’s the evening and an impressive phone

Why is it not good for Indonesia?
@mkbhd please if you can get this message fast. Would you recommend me trading a OnePlus 7 pro for this phone that you reviewed? Reason being because I&#39;m curious about the phone. OnePlus 7 pro 2019 user here

11hunsky and no wireless charging, I&#39;m out.

wow.. dust storage

Forget the impressive specs - unless you live in a bubble or a hospital, this phone has too many ways to get damaged and the whole motor thing would have me on edge the entire time I have it!  To each his own but for me, I&#39;ll stay with the conventional smartphone!

I have the same one and my color is purple I love yay it is the best phone I have ever had I love like alot I thanked mom like alot and there is actually airpods for oppo and I&#39;m getting it

*walks into hand rail

No interest
But with the design of this phone if the motor fails you can grab the phone from each side and manually lift up the camera module unlike the popup camera on oneplus phone.

<a href="">4:46</a> ghost spotted :D

Give all the money to the swap drivers
I think it&#39;s shit hot.

naaaaaaaaaaaaah. way too much sand here where i live.

1950 : In the future we will have flying cars2018 : phone boners

Bring Samsung a80 review, can&#39;t wait!
OPPO software is disgusting

Why is there a chin. My xs max has no chin. Is there a reason?

Is it possible to remove color OS?

any news about the phone durability and practicality ?nobody on youtube has done that yet !!!

Good

&quot;Integrated of a thoughtful design&quot; <b>spot on</b> 👌specs 👌👌

watch is pakistani price

Intreasting

I love that camera

beautiful

It&#39;s okay.. before those moving parts fall off there&#39;s a new phone model that u will buy for sure. So doesn&#39;t matter. These days a phone model only lasts few months before owner buys an upgrade

U can’t have a case... imma smash this like 30 times

Hi can anyone tell me the price of this phone?

Its amazing really , i like it

Icon pack?
I have one. All&#39;hamdu&#39;lillah

erection phone

Chinese Glans phone
I love the screen.

How to can join

the person who named this mobile phone MUST BE A MATHS TEACHERBecause FIND X

a grain of sand ..or water ..or Jerryrigeverything could happen😂

The most beautiful design in a smartphone still in 2019

Is one plus 7 coming with this kind of a SLIDER? is it real? 😑😑🤙

Yes, but how is this phone going to wear a condom?.....

Are oppo vivo getting more innovative then apple??!!

Is look a ugly
Well now we know what the next OnePlus will be

Thats iromans bleeding edge phone.... Hahaha

1 thing I never like side glass screen. Once droped, it&#39;ll crack.

<a href="">4:50</a> &quot;this things crazy man&quot; - not your voice man

Oppo are the best!

Nice OPPO finde x
NEX has X in it too.

Nice review ... very balances and informative .... great work !

If this had finger print and an earphone jack..

Have never seen this guy before but I like his demeanor and delivery. Very polished.

gotta say it&#39;s a very high-level design, the pop-up camera is also considering the privacy issue.

pretty cool

Oppo...say it like O&#39;Neill. Why aappo?

Shit will fail within a few month. Anything that can move will fail.

I think it good.

so basically it&#39;s a phone that can get a boner

Yea wait a second let me take a picture: GRRRRRRSHHHHHH......20 second later SNAP GRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSHHHHHH... oke we can go now.

OPPO is the best mobile compony in the world

I guess, slider phones are making a comeback?

Can you pull the camera mechanism out to automatically launch the Camera app regardless or what screen you&#39;re on?

how the case work?

Who&#39;s that sweety at <a href="">4:46</a> Marques? 👀

haw much

Good

You sound like matthias from dope or nope

The team have been working on this phone for more than 3 years.

bordo is dark red in turkish but i dont know why they would use it

Ugly shit skin...

still cheaper than iPhone X..........

How do cases for it work?

Marques made use of  Linus&#39;s phone more than him.

Can’t spy me anymore!

<a href="">3:39</a> for the slidy bit

Where you meant to put a case?

superb phone by oppo, oppo works really hard to achieve it . i am not a fan of oppo. but i read about  OPPO company ,this company keep tries to innovate new things , whether they works or not and now it is standing with most popular companies like apple , samsung

FBI can&#39;t see me if my camera is only open when in use.

I like it

You call this the face recognition &#39;safe but with any phone with face recognition can be unlocked by a sibling or a person in your family if they have facial features like yours, which they will have.

But the camera means that it&#39;ll be hard to make a case for the phone

no headphone jack, i wish reviews started with that, cya.

The only bad one that this new china phones have to mutch SAR  radiation. For me a smartphone with over 0.5 Sar on Head is not acceptable!!!

Original but 0 protective shell with this system not great
that looks more like S8

S

thumbs up for the dog! <a href="">1:57</a>

IS THAT A BEAGLE?? WOW 😁😁
I almost though that western people only use iphone

I heard 3740 million power battery. Isn’t supposed to be 3740 milli-ampere-hours

Damn. How do I get one of those phones? Phones 📱

Face id isnt safe...twins can open it...thete are lots of video on youtube. So beter not say its safe

that&#39;s not ur phone.. so that cannot stay in ur pocket

<a href="">1:54</a> Please wallpaper link :D

How about its case?

❤ How much in india 🇮🇳
another chinese phone, who&#39;s the CFO of OPPO?

As much as i wanted this phone, just the retracting cameras ruins it for me :( i live in the country surrounded by dirt and dust so it wouldn&#39;t last long with me. Would rather compromise camera quality for one that will actually last longer than a year.

Do oppo really find it X?

I like how in every phone review on YouTube, there&#39;s a Jerryrigeverything recommended video below of that phone being destroyed.

My my ...one grain of sand..u killed it bro...

VISHAL MASIH GILL PIND DHARIWAL KALER AMRITSAR, AJNALA, PUNJAB 143102
Copy of Iphone X and XS

How much this price

this phone is kinda legendary.

One year review of this device should be on your list

looks good no? cool design... really don&#39;t have the exatly same screen like Samsung

<b>&quot;oh-po&quot;</b>

Fingerprint is bs

very nice phone compatible with iphone
I&#39;ve discovered this phone today at the shop.. Never heard about this brand. But when I&#39;ve slided to open the camera....oooooohhhhuu! The effect is very cool.What I&#39;ve noticed except of the sliding camera is the screen, beautiful colors and definition, and the response time is almost instantaneus.

Algebra teachers favourite phone...(i hope u get the joke)

Madness kya bhai ??

I am surprised you don&#39;t mention the obvious thing to me which is what about cases?  if the phone changes size you&#39;ll need an innovative case.

Omg they copy the vivo nex s

meanwhile, Apple introduced new emojis

Wew

Jana fidu phone aa
It&#39;s nice and all, but if you give me a 1000 dollar phone with this software, what&#39;s the point...

The motorized part (up &amp; down) can last up to 11,000,000 times or more. Lag happened on that part where you opened the camera, it&#39;s because the application and motorized itself is getting things ready for the better experience. Have a nice day!

Nice video hd

<a href="">1:59</a> Did anyone else see that dog XD

&quot;Oh-ppo&quot; is the pronunciation.

!!!!

I love this phone but the only downside is that there is no fingerprint reader

I wanna know how much it cost in Rupees?

Oppo find x seems too fragile once camera is open.

YOUR THE MOST BIAS REVIEWER EVER.......HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

How would a case work with that

How do u put a case on this tho?

The Vivo NEX is still better imo; bigger screen

Very nice voiceThank u

This, the Honour Magic 2 or the Oneplus 6t? I&#39;m looking for a great phone that won&#39;t break the bank :D.

Did he find the X tho?

This moving camera feature is cool, but I am sure its a huge magnet for dust and other particles.

This phone is really bad compare with other phone-.-

V nice..I wish I could hav ths!!

Can you even talk on the phone? There&#39;s no top speaker.

There’s a brand called “Nobia” just got a pretty fancy new design. It has displays on both sides of the phone which is insane!! It’s sooooo fancy and pretty

Whats the wallpaper you were using when showcasing the oppo

The Notch, I wonder how endurable this phone is.

Hi @marques brownlee. At <a href="">4:22</a> you do a comparison of the FaceID vs Oppo Facial recognition. How do you set up the iphone so it doesn&#39;t try to unlock until you swipe up? Or were you simply not looking at the phone till you decided to swipe? Thanks in advance. Would love to know.

So how would cases’ work with the moving camera?

I think this motor will not long last at all.

There is one flaw here. What if I want to take a picture horizontally? Not one of mkhbhd&#39;s best reviews.

I don&#39;t understand why everyone that wants a bezelless display on their phone doesn&#39;t put the fingerprint sensor to the back of the device? Face unlock with never be as secure as fingerprint sensor so I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re kidding themselves.

What about the phone cover?

So im just wondering if they got the company word Oppo from Oppa? (a korean word)

Bye bye cases. So even easier to break haha.

shit I got NEX and then this guy pops out.

As a Chinese, I am proud of my country’s product, it has amazing design! But I just do not like Android so I have to choose apple

Do you have any tech that don&#39;t use that I could have

I was having some issue with my pop up mechanism becoming loose and Oppo changed it. Now it&#39;s fixed and I can not pull the top part out manually anymore.(I tried it after I saw Ur video). Kind of a good fix I guess. Good thing I have 3 years warranty from Oppo here in Australia

Ugly face for a long time talking...
Look, for those concerned with like sand getting in ur phone....WHO WILL FREAKIN DRAG THERE PHONE INTO THE BEACH???? and this types of phone isn&#39;t really for like a normal careless consumer, it&#39;s a piece of art not to be messed with but cared of

Its really great phone in market

Oppo gangnam style....
it still can&#39;t compare apple iPhone x

Wowww 😍😍😍
Still the best phone for me now even it doesn&#39;t have fingerprint sensor and wireless charging technology. Unlike the honor magic two and xiaomi&#39;s mi mix3 i find this device a totally innovated product not because of it&#39;s design but the idea of how the product was made. It&#39;s totally brilliant idea.

Hello Dada Akta Paua jaba? Gorib manus
that no head phone jack is still a deal breaker was looking to break away from samsung but seems that its one of the only flagship phones that have it these days

very pretty pleace give me oppo find x giveway

Wow this is an amazing design. A job well done oppo engineers.

I think they already tested the moving part and rate at least 100 thousand

Now I’m wondering how you put a case on that with a motorized camera

pretty phone

How will they do the phone case?

Nice wow wow Wow

Marques:“If this phone came to your region it’s gonna be very expensive” Me: huh, have you heard of Apple phones?

Bordeaux Red is more a red wine kind of colour.

Meh, Im still waiting for hologram tech TBH.

A dog caught my eye

<i>Should be more like a switch blade</i>

why are you concentrating on saying a grand of sand gets into the motor instead of saying this is a well designed successful notchless phone. I feel like your review is bias.

Looks like every other phone on the market.

I&#39;d rather the phone just be a tad longer and forget the motorised bit. It&#39;s very good and very clever, but how long it would work for, would worry me a little. Enough not to buy one.

Say goodbye to cases

Here in the Philippines oppo is very popular but i don&#39;t think people gonna spend $1000 or 53,000 pesos on a OPPO smartphone. Flagship phones are not really common in the Philippines,  most of the people here have budget smartphones ranging from $300-500.

This phone is fucking garbage

All those effing folders on the front screen... I detect an iPhone user !

Not diggin&#39; the look of the back. But a sick dbrand skin on there would be dope af

Better screen to body ratio that iPhone x and no notch and slightly cheaper. What more can you ask for

software looks like a cheap ios
I want this fucking phone so bad

Nice review .. Beautiful phone

Ew oppo.

...how tf do u put a case on this thing?

1200$ here in singapore hahaha

Screw you Ms.Randeria, i found it, here is x, I FOUND X

more better with a nocth,  simetrical thin nocth in up n buttom phone, nocth n noch chin as a camera n front speaker..  thats more genius.. n glass back just a big space for nothing, that better if back has a screen..

Can u use a case?
who is here after google dropped notch bomb

Just look amazing. I do not want to think downsides right now. Just looks amazing and also has vooc charging. WOW

Yesss incredible true story!!!
No chance of using a case on this phone

Looks like upcoming galaxy S10
how about a protective case

OPPO FIND X.......😉😉😉😉
Oppo is best in design
Nah, look like S8 or S9. Samsung Edges still the best.

the only main downside that stop me get this flagship phone is it’s a chin phone and no under screen fingers print

Nice camera

Hn bi de de
That thing charge only in 35mins!!!

I’ve seen it many times in China it’s one of China’s Samsung+apple phone #1. It’s company is designed to take photos

If only this have a headphone jack

One question, how can you call a smartphone flagship or midrange?

I checked the cell service for us carriers.....me like

Watching on a find x with nova launcher

imagine trying to make a case for one of these lmao

Future!

The phone doesnt even look that good tbh

<a href="">1:19</a> You should’ve said on the surface it looks calm and ready.

Watching this on my oppo find x. Says no one. 😂😂😂

iPhone is better and cooler

Can&#39;t use a case I guess. Phone always expanding.
More importantly camera is hidden making the company incapable to access our surroundings even if they want to. This to me is actually more important. And it’s Chinese product. Re define your standards west

so, no case available....
can you do a review on the mi 8 and the vivo v11? please

G !!!!! Oppo is living in 2030 (lol)

I feel like this is unnecessary. Bezelless phones seem like more of a hassle than a great feature. I had to get a third party app to turn off the screen recognition of the edges of my note 8 because when I would hold it with one hand sideways I would constantly accidentally tap the screen. Keep edges on phones!!!

If Apple had come up with this design first, the price would have been a million dollar.

An innovation for these smart phones would be to make them durable. First thing you do when you purchase one is slap a cheap case to protect it. What’s the point on spending money on designing the back and display glass? Wireless charging “ the day that we can actually recharge our batteries just as simple as we use wireless internet. That would be the day you can call it real wireless charging...innovation!

Heck yeah varsity frisbee

One more benefit is that you don&#39;t accidentally touch the camera optic with your dirty fingers, so it stays clean?

Just get the NEX S, BIGGER,FASTER,STRONGER,CHEAPER

You are a champ!  I love how candid your reviews are.  You do a good job of covering the good, bad and everything in between.  You absolutely hit the mark of providing a hands on experience of how this phone feels and behaves.  I don&#39;t need to test drive this phone I can do it vicariously through you.

Very futuristic...!! Good job mkbhd...!!!

Amazing phone! But why companies still create this weird UI on the top of Android OS?

&quot;Madness!&quot;

U cannot doubt the face ID it has 3D scanning hardware like iPhone x Which recognise ur face in dark as well and the motor mechanism is tested to work 3 lakh time it means 150 times a day for 5 years. What else u want in this price!!

there are drawbacks but the phone looks pretty sick

I&#39;m in love... hope they&#39;re not spying on us though lmao

Unbox therapy did a very good review! Tiia video sucks

Still has a crap OS,  time to loose Android as its Google bloatware.......

How you undermine it is hilarious!! All iPhone comparison.. like the iPhone is the best.. way to support innovation.. way to go.. loser

That’s a SICK looking phone!

it&#39;s chinese, no fucking way! prob spies on you too. &gt;:o

no headphonejeck ,no case,chinesephone,high price,plastic
i like the out side of box thinking but... no they needed to work on more this is not such a good design

bainchud

That&#39;s my next phone. ( current daily driver is note 8).

Omgsh that lag -is crazy

but can it run crysis??

For $830? No thanks

cool phone...way better than notches!

Who needs 8 GB of ram on a SMARTPHONE

Who is doin&#39; REAL innovation? It&#39;s not only OPPO...

But let&#39;s buy a 1500$ phone

Face ID only is horrible, if I&#39;m wearing sun glasses it doesn&#39;t recognize my face. I also alternate between contacts and regular vision glasses and it sometimes doesn&#39;t recognize me in those either. And I have to aim the camera at myself for it to work, which is actually a few degrees above the tilt that I normally hold my phone at so it&#39;s a bit annoying. I have both enabled but I find myself just sliding my finger over the sensor to unlock more often than using face id (Although it does come in handy if you&#39;re eating and don&#39;t want to touch your phone too much lol)

Beautiful

Its cool until that motor starts to fail.

look´s like this is great phone let me ask you not sure if you say on the video that phone is water proof??

Please do a scratch test and make sure to remove the screen protector. The oppo find X has gorilla Glass 6

It is like a iPhone and Samsung combined together!!

Can this phone work on the Verizon Network?

Up next a motorized case for this phone.

But how can I get one tho

And apple is offering 720p for $750 😂😂😂

IIt is almost 1 cm thick, right?

Im just worried about dust getting into that mechanism..And i want this phone so badly, but.... 1000 dollars, for a 3700mAH battery......When the Honor Note 10 is looking at me over there for just 600 dollars with a 5000 mAH battery..I cant say no to that battery man.

Thousands of oppo finx cases on Ebay.Guys do research before any question or conclusion!

can i have this phone as give away hehe.

This is the first time I&#39;ve heard of this. That camera feature is dope!

how you gonna find a case for that lol

You can&#39;t spy on people in public. I stick with my S8.

Wont that scratch the lens of the camera eventually when you will keep using the camera though?

Steve Jobs working for Oppo now.

1k dollas for a piece of crap which has a nice man in black neuralyzer camera effect.. Any phones without a headphone jack should not even go on the market

I&#39;d be so excited and drop the phone 💀

Very beautiful phone. I&#39;d definitely buy it if I had money to

How to use a case?

Love your videos Marques. I would love to get my hands on one as I love Chinese phones. At the moment my Daly driver is OnePlus 5t what a phone👍👍

So not for Dubai... noted

If the motor breaks, just used the included needle nose pliers to pull it out and a hammer to put it back in. Problem solved.

I love things like this that are motorized and SLOWLY pop up or out. Hell, It doesn&#39;t even have to have a camera or do anything at all, just pop out in that ultra cool way!!!!! Linux, is you have anymore of these, even with a broken camera, I&#39;ll PM you my addres. SO JAMES BOND!

<a href="">3:49</a> lol

Oppo camera makes everyone beautiful. Haha
legit

cant decide between this or the huawei phone .. apple is just too pricey

I love the phone... I wished chinese phones were more easily accessible to buy in North America.

OPPO X LOVE

Good luck taking a picture of moving targets (e.g. animals) with that phone, by the time that camera pops up the dog would&#39;ve moved already.

I feel uncomfortable when I see 7999 comments. I want to make the 8000th one!
Dear Marques, please tell me how is the overall performance of it compared to galaxy S8

I spot Logic&#39;s TITS album art oof
how i wish to have.. 😥😥😥

Picked up one of these today. It feels really nice and premium, but it sucks up dust more than a vacuum cleaner.  And it&#39;s such a fingerprint magnet.

U are brilliant bro..... more reviews

I guarantee, 2 years from now no one will ever care about this motorized feature.

Oppo actually said that it is very hard to break and that you can open and close the camera about 300k times. That&#39;s a crazy amount..

If you&#39;re ever hesitant to get a phone just watch Marques Brownlee ..

No headphone jack no buy
Which case should we use on it?🤔🤔

Thank god for the PLA. China makes the best phones, tablets and computers and will eventually rule the world. Cheaper, better and far superior to the pricey overrated rubbish from Korea and US!

I don&#39;t know what you would do about cases

The design is so sleek

Really amazing phone.been using for few weeks.

Phone is actually new and futuristic but how to put a case or cover on it?

Nice one

Is there a good case for this

2 fails for me, no head phone jack and no wireless charging, and by it being Oppo, I was expecting a killer DAC.

The phone is not English so it&#39;s not pronounce like you pronounce it We call it OH-POHNot Apo OPPO IN EUROPE=OH-POH in english Its irritating hearing English pronouncing everything theyre way

8g ram perhhhhhh
at least with these phones they can&#39;t spy on us lol

The issues I can see is that exposed area for when the motor moves the camera upwards. It&#39;s too easy for dust and other materials to gunk up the inside. It would take some serious creativity to make a case for this phone.

<a href="">2:22</a> say no more. Next!!!!
Wowooooo

Post a video on Blackberry Key 2

Ah the hate

TELLING A JOKE: THE CHINESE BRAND OPPO&amp; VIVO HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE AUTHUENTIC FULL-SCREEN SMARTPHONES, AND IPHONE STILL HAS A NASTY NOTCH FOR SOME YEARS

wireless charging is so over-rated - i never use it on my iphone x because i still like to use it when charging + it makes no time difference whatsoever to plug it in then to put it down on a charging base (which is still plugged in by a cord anyway)... + it takes longer to charge on a wireless base and you have to turn it off at the switch inbetween charges to protect it from losing power...

when are we getting the r17 pro review?

Jus wondering how phone case fit in this piece? Probably it’s mentioned in video but I fast forwarded XD

price this

Oppo only cares about the design but don&#39;t consider the moving mechanism maybe break soon enough/less durable. This is the step to take for Oppo to desperately keep up with huge companies like Samsung and Iphone...This flagship doesn&#39;t have water/dust resistant, no headphone jack, no wireless charging, LOW PPI SCREEN, no microSD slot. Why would you buy an expensive phone without all those??? And get only less durable phone with camera in out design??? No no thanks

It would be better that the camera pop out manually like the movement that had the old lg Chocolate

vivo and oppo actually owned by one mother company

oppo find x vs vivo nex s ? which is a better buy?

i just watch the back design OMG

I disagree with your Nex-comparison: this mechanism feels like a gimmick that was mainly implemented to look cool, while the Nex has the more practical solution. You could use the Nex for weeks without having to pop the camera out. You can’t even use the Find X for a second without the camera. Aside from durability issues, popping up and down multiple times a day probably isn’t good for your battery life. This is a big pass for me.

In my opinion, facial recognition is not as useful as fingerprint recognition. This phone does not need to consider opening the phone because it requires facial recognition when unlocking, because it supports screen fingerprint unlocking.
Smartphone goals : motorised boner..

Watching this in my iPhone 6plus just makes me wanna throw my phone off the window and ask my self: WTF was I using in the past couple of years? God dammit!

That is not creative, not innovative, it&#39;s stupid and ridiculous. 😡

It is the future baby

I’m struggling to find the appeal of this phone compared to the S9+, which gains a 1440p  QHD display, IP68 waterproofing, a headphone jack, great stereo speakers, fast wireless charging, expandable storage if you need it, much better cameras with dual OIS and 4K 60, a fingerprint sensor for when facial recognition isn’t feasible as well as not having Oppo’s restrictive if not unappealing skin all while having no notch. Add to that the fact that many will inevitably trust Samsung over Oppo due to being a more established brand with better support. Most importantly I feel the mechanism is nowhere near as durable as a fixed system and THAT TERRIBLE CAMERA LAG as well as having all the sensors and cameras in that area which probably won’t work with a case and is going to get a bunch of dust and dirt in - terrible idea. . I feel ALL those combined aren’t worthy trade offs just to have a few mm more screen and I certainly would choose the S9+ any day. Looking at the specs of the Find X, it seems that it is uncannily close to a OnePlus 6. IMHO get the S9+ over this as a splurge option for a lesser cost and the OnePlus 6 at half the price if you don’t care about all those added luxuries of the S9+. Remember that even when purchasing the OnePlus 6 at around HALF the price, you will still be getting a very similar if not better experience as you will have everything of the Find X and still gain a solid, non moving structure, fingerprint sensor and a small bit of waterproofing over the Find X. Honestly considering the S9+ and OnePlus 6 having much more features or much less of a pricetag respectively, the Find X is frankly ridiculous other than just eye candy. Who agrees?

Innovative but not reliable

Lag City, and u really just pulled up and messed with a phone that is not yours

Big no no, not just sand but dust will accumulate and jam it . It is just a matter of when not if.

Should I get this, it’s $900, or the popoco for $300?

No headphone jack. I&#39;ll pass on this. Other than that great review/overview of this device. It&#39;s a step in the right direction above all.

<a href="">1:59</a>  So cute doggy~
Please the Mountain wallpaper

Actually Vivo &gt; oppo

It has finger print????

S8?

How about the case

<a href="">1:57</a> doggo on the right

Does this phone work with U.S carrier?

If the motor fails, you can just pull the camera.Not much for a close to bezel less experience.

Finger senser is available or not

Bro pls do the unboxing video, it&#39;s my dream . Because Iam working in oppo India

Hi Dear. Dear I want you help me . I buy phone so you suggest me we buy oppo find x or Samsung Galaxy Note 9

Clever thinking to notch oppo. Kinda creativity but surely gonna be an awful material for some.

Do one for R17 pls!

crap

Why nothing about the camera quality, performance and software though?

Better design as compare to ishit x

I don&#39;t know about moving parts..... I can see the motor dying... and camera stuck in an awkward position.

Fuck this Chinese phone

People may not know about Oppo or the Oppo n3 with the motorized rotating camera I have 2 and they both still work even my oclick remote so yeah the motors last

Can u unlock it with a photo? You mention it but don&#39;t tell us how the testing went? No fingerprint seems pretty silly unless on a budget bottom end model. No bezels is a shame.

a good looking device, with a smart way to hide the cam. but TBH it&#39;s not the WISEST solution, it&#39;s not going to be the future of smartphone, period. There gotta be some sort of under-display selfie cam or image sensor tech

Jfjdhdhdhdhehrh
This means a lot of cracked screens as I can&#39;t imagine you can put a decent case on this.

Just get rid of the frontfacing camera. Didn&#39;t need that in my first phone either.

lol how is face id secure,, just because it is from apple does not mean it is safe,

Camera test please

Nice overview.- I like the notchless full screen display.- No camera on the back does give it a bit of a premium touch (ie camera so important it only comes out when you need it, otherwise it’s fully protected).- The camera module popping up to unlock it, that would be an area where it would be opening and closing so many more times than just for the cameras.Does look a lovely device.

Bad rating ur phn😕
Just buy a samsung

The motorized section can rise up and come down 50,000 times, meaning for an average camera user it may last over 8 years which is okay. So the lift span of the motorized section is 50,000 complete up-and-down cycles

Price

Awesome Look, Camera design Supebr
Until now, im using the Oppo N3 limited edition. I still love it, especially the camera! I have it for more than 3years now, but still kicking!

May I know from 0% battery, how many minutes to full charge?Compare to Oneplus , which one is more durable of usage?

Imagine the case for that 🤔

I was really interested in this phone until he said no headphone jack

Im thinking of getting this phone, guys what do you think?

Nice

Price

Weak AF specs.

China No.1

My question is how could you use a phone case with that?

2x(ab+5)=2ab-15x  find x

oppo find x which colour is looking good broblue or redpls tell me bro

Wow i like it! Who needs a case when you got this phone to showoff

Nice video bro

at <a href="">4:46</a> his escort has arrived

Will it run fortnite xD ?

Vivo nex is better than this shit phone with no camera security

Holy crap CHS?! I played for Watchung Hills!!!

Y&#39;all forgetting about oppo F7•facial recognition•fingerprint reader•headphone jack•way cheaper•case compatible Idk but you might want to consider

So many cool phones coming out everyday with better cameras and storages but I’d still stick to IPhone.

I think Marques said &quot;Man&quot; more times in this video than the rest of his videos combined

No fingerprint no headphone... So what is the use of this phone ...

well i have a note 8 i was planing the get the note 9 but after Oppo i think i will wait with the note9. this oppo looks awesome.

Nah

🤓 They should make a budget version that is NonMotorized, i dont mind flicking it open and close, maybe with my thumb, its also a good way to improve camera privacy 😍

Bordeaux red as in red wine from Bordeaux France. Typically has deep red/purple hues. Cheers!

DO A SAND TEST!!

What I’m wondering is what kind of case you could get that lets the phone still move

Ming Chi Cow!
Dude what are you saying? That phone is cool! I like it.

its all cool, but like what about a case

I guess it wont last longer

I want this. But I have iPhone 😁

Overpriced crap

Will this work on Tmobile?

Anything but the notch! 👍👍

TITS at <a href="">4:28</a>!!!!

.

no jack
china no. 1   iphone will be fail

Any idea when this or the Apex or Nex might be available in the states?

Avilabel saudi arabia??
hm

With a camera like that...explain how a case works

How i wish smartphone in next 5 or 10 years... People can upgrade ram internal memory graphics card themselves like today CPU without needing to buy a new phone...

I love find x

Thanks for your videoI love the 845, 8GB ram, 256 storage and the rest but I hate the pop up camera.  But it will get dirt dust and stuff in there and mess it up over time IMO..  Cool design but bad idea IMO.  I would not buy this phone for that reason.

can this work with osmo mobile ??

so is the camera slow or fast?😂

this is fucking beautiful god damn it

Motorized camera opens up Oppo Find X to damage plus.......not water resistant.Looks like garbage to me.

Super

Same to same copy iPhone x 🤭
But can you use a case???

Nokia should make this

Apple will have a hard time launching its next flagship.😃

76 provinces;
I like iPhone X better. Oppo is not good

how the hell do you buy a case for that?

Cover ?

Nice 1 op

I guess it will just eat lots of battery with that motorized camera

What will happen if the camera wouldn&#39;t pop up anymore?

Samsung, Apple, your move...
Only here bc i seen an idiot on 5 miles trying to sell for $1500. This dumbass phone isnt worth $400 never even heard of oppo but its for sure nothing special.

😄，i have one

yaman 😂

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a motor. Movemens can be achieved by solenoids. Apply circular current to move a metal axially.

After changing the keyboard this phone is pretty good looks amazing

Can you put a case on it?

Bordeaux red is the colour between purple and red.  Like the colour of wine.

to bad this doesn&#39;t survive on Zack&#39;s(jerryrigeverything) bend test and put to the wall of shame unlike the Vivo Nex who survive the test...

Great notch-less design. I literally hate notches on phones🙄

The most unique phone design in the few recent years. I wish this phone would inspire other companies to do the same, which is using creativity to design phones like back when time when nokia was still famous,  there was tons of different models available for buyers to use in different purposes, and now they just copy each other or upgrade a stronger software, call that&#39;s a new phone

Stop TRYING to break the motor :&#39;(

He keeps using the word &quot;unique&quot;??? Samsung S9 has all these features and can do the fingerprint sensor and waterproof and and and... on top of that it&#39;s about the same price. You would have to be really stupid to buy this over a Samsung.

Is the in-display camera idea dead? Cause honestly it seemed like a much better solution compared to relying on a motor that is much more likely to degrade overtime and easier to break.

So, I am told a face unlock is less secure than unlocking with a pin. So I use only a pin. In that case, that moving part will have a long life with the likes of me. Further, I don&#39;t take that many photos.

I read oppo find ten.. wait what?! Owh..

would have bought it if it had nfc and headphone jack

Plzz do 60fps rendering!!!
The real question is, how to make a case for this phone since the camera popping up like that?

Cool, but no interest
price for phone ???

how much .???...

The phone looks absolutely fantastic! However, I feel after the novelty has worn off, the whole mechanized thing will get painful to use as a daily driver. Cheers

What may be the  price

How do you make a case for this?

Anyone comment on how the whole UI looks like iOS? Or not really important...

so when is the expected release date? how did marques miss this?

Even though it&#39;s not coming out in the US can we still purchase this phone?

over $1000 for a 1080p screen, did apple develop this one?

No fingerprint scanner on this just really gets under my skin, so much sacrificed for a useless feature.

I guess no cases will work on it...

i seldom use camera. but like the design! thats all!

wow just amazing and unique phone of 2k18... but I&#39;m not gonna buy it.. bcz the name reminds me of maths.. Find X?

lost me at no headphone jack

Are They out in north america. Couldnt find a price either. Anybody know?

Dumb phone. I dislike it.

Looks like s8

So, how much you want for the phone?

why invent bicycle twice?

I have one question WHY DOES IT HAVE A CHIN

Samsung patented the in screen fingerprint scanner

Background, button placement , software, shape.... all a copy 9f Samsung s9 lmao

It is an amazing phone no doubt it terms of how it looks and functions. However the moving parts do raise some concerns. I still love my mate 10 Pro though.

Fall on the left:CRACKFall on the right:CRACKFall on the front:CRACKFall on the bottom:CRACKFall on thd back:CRACKFall in the top: CRACK AND YOU BREAK YOUR MOTORIZED CAMERA<b>NOW YOU WASTED YOU MONEY ON THIS BEZELESS SHIT</b>

1. I cannot see a grown man or even a teenage boy go around with even the blue varient. 2. Its not durable at all. (Go research about that) 3. No headphone jack4. I can literally only see girls with this phone because of that design. 5. Quality of the motor is not really that good

shout out to logic :)

it&#39;s a very good and smart design, but maybe not for those who want to take stealth photos with their phones hahaha also, just worry about the durability of the motor part....cos we do turn our phone phone cameras on and off quite often ......and if you accidentally stuck something there...then ur done......... also that sound tho........................

hmmm no..not for daily .. i love fancy phone casing.. maybe not even buy this phone..

Jerry rigs everything!:D

Is there a way to always keep the cameras up?

Buy Laptop Instead.
it had to be iPhone X

Very nice phone

Is the front bottom black bezel thicker than the top bezel?Can it be used with a protection case? Will the top be protected? Thanks

I think the OPPO phone is more suitable for girls. If you are a boy, I think Huawei, vivo and millet are better choices.

Samsung is far far far far better in quality and reliability than these cheap Chinese manufactures like xiaomi, vivo,oppo and others. Samsung always has its brand value. Where were these chinese players when android was not there, samsung,sony,lg and apple and others great brands are there in industry a decade ago, they had there own OS and they were making awesome phones. Just because of google OS these chinese players are doing too much. We should not encourage these people and make a destruction to our grand old companies who gave us extraordinary phones for more than a decade.

Only thing missing is the stock android

s9 + iphone = oppo

How can I buy one

Is it possible to have a case on it and take photos without removing the case?  Can&#39;t imagine that.

How about the battery life?

The future is here !!

How will their cover be  ?

Funny how muricans call every face recognition unlock system a Face ID clone. Just because Apple had it first... Like every plane is a Wright Flyer clone... -.-

Make a comparison video between one plus 6 and oppo find X

I trust Oppo with this camera, my current phone is the Oppo n3

Hey marques in samsung themes they had your logo

Which one would you recommend to buy the oppo find x or the vivo nex

So what do the photos actually look like? Perhaps compare them against other flagships?

Yo. How are you gonna put a case on there

Hhh great phone, i had thjs idea of a camera popping out like that on a phone but i dont know how to work on a 3d programe :D i see now rbat someone had that idea realised maybe even before j had it . Peace

Being as I hardly ever go to the beach anymore, I would totally buy this if it became available in my area! Hear that T-Mobile?

I think THIS is the future of phones not the notchMotorized camera and a under glass fingerprint scanner

Great design but how would you put a case on this thing?

In case you get some dust near the camera when the motorized top is opened ..wont that part get too many scratches ?

Is a good phone

This face id has the same 1/1000000 failure rate as the iphone x so it&#39;s just as secure. Watch the launch event

Please make a comparison between s9+and oppo find x man. It would be great

I&#39;m not a fan of no headphone jack. so nope.

why don&#39;t you mention the price?

Good phone but dissatisfied with a motors plus what abt the damn cover !

My channel

mast

Aesthetics nowadays over ease of use.

sounds like algebra. Find X = Y + Z
Not an oppo user but its cool

No more spying through the cameras . Take that FBI!

Awesome phone

Actual innovation done right, not like crapple with their 2years behind anything hardware

Oppo will soon be banned by the US gov

It's great, brother!
Does this mean no case?

Thanks for info

Oppo is more innovative then apple and Samsung

<b>OPPO Killed It !</b>

iphone x cause the sane and isn&#39;t  anything close to it

$1200 w no wireless charging

You look like Donovan Mitchell!
How would a case work ?

It’s insane how similar this looks to iOS 7

Good luck putting a case on it.

Awsome yet expensive

I thought they had an under screen fingers print scanner

Needs a motorized case

How can you put a case for this?

No Headphone Jack = automatically Pass

Like to see a case on it

Just tell me how can I put a case on it

&quot;it&#39;s called Bordeaux Red some reason, I don&#39;t know why&quot;Bordeaux ..... Famous region in France for wine... Especially RED wine.... Hence the &quot;Bordeaux Red&quot; name.... Just a bit of international education for you mate. Greetings from Australia.

fantastic
Interesting phone. Some flaws i dont think they needed the slide up theres more relible way of hiding the camras but still unique

010

The biggest thing in Realme is its 6GB Battery which makes it a great phone.
hmm I wonder what kind of case we can use with this phone

CAMERA NEEDS CLEAN AND AVOID CRACKS SO OPPO X DID IT BETTER WITH POP UP CAMERA .VERY SMART CAMERA EXCELLENT!RECONSIDER SDCARD .

I need that wallpaper!!!

What is the cost

Chinese (oppo) are more creative than Americans (iPhone)

Nice

Victor Oladipo

THE FUTURE IS HERE

Me: &quot;plays game&quot;phone: &quot;opens camera automatically&quot;me: WHADDUP BIATCH

Please help me I have been try to buy a new phone for a month, but its hard to decide any suggestions please?

&#39;Give permission to use Camera?&#39;ONLY WHEN OPEN BISH

This is the kind of phone I imagined an alien or predator to use within a space movie

I think Oppo find X is better than iPhone X

Cant find cute phone case for this phone😕

that is a sick phone!

motorised display is coming up

Best phone of 2018.

haha OPPO is number ONE IN SUPPER LAG CITY

Sorry, I can&#39;t live without a fingerprint reader anymore.

this phone had been test that could be open close for 300k timesand this phone have sensor when it drops, it will close the camera automatic

Hmmm. I found many comments about that Chinese designers are the better than USA designers. I will open you are secret, the designers that worked in Apple and other Eirope, Korean companies now working in Chinese companies. I know it, because know people who are working there .

So no case is gonna fit it ? Also I don’t get the need for headphone jacks, I’d much rather I could choose headphones that did the A/D conversion than my phone. I hate the output stage of iPhones for instance. Besides bloody headphones are increasingly affordable.

I wonder how the phone cover look like 🤔

Better than iphone XOppo winner

i&#39;m thinking about the casing.....🤔

I take it.. since camera pops out.. you cant put a protective case on it?

So what about cases though? With an all glass phone there&#39;s no way I&#39;d personally feel comfortable leaving it bare. Would there just be a cutout at the top allow for the changing height of the phone? I know not everyone would worry about making sure its in a case, but there&#39;s still that consideration.

glass on both sidescan&#39;t use any case?hmmm

i still love my iphone x 😪
Not a good phone

That stealth camera was really cool though but a non water and dust resistant for a $1k, I don&#39;t think so.Just seems like it&#39;s less durable than the other phones, just my opinion though.

no wireless charging?
Im in love with it! It&#39;s a new player to outplay ronaldo/neymar/ronaldinho so it&#39;s pretty serious business!

My dog needs a new toy

skins and back covers? would be interesting to see how they fit?

Vivo not better mobile
Oppo is the better mobile vivo

Motorized top? No thank you. It will eventually malfunction.

I have Oppo N3 the rotating camera since 2014. still good now. so I think Im definitely gonna go for this :o

i love your reviews  you are the best when it comes to phones

Dene price antha

Let&#39;s wait for apple to invent the hidden camera and the under screen finger print reader

With a motorized design, it&#39;s gonna hard finding a good back case for the phone. Highly likely, the case won&#39;t cover the top part of the phone.

Could u do oppo vs iphone

Coooooooooool

So I have to remove case every time for a picture ?

I really dig this color. More purple - ish phones please!

Wow what&#39;s with China being ahead of the curve with phones? Less market regulations?

Does this phone have multi users like Google pixel?

CIA CAN&#39;T SPY ON YOU BABE.

8 GB RAM,dang........

Whit washed black gut lmao

battery is a total waste

Oppo does really have a Rather good History of Achievements like OPPO once even set a New Record of the Fastest Fingerprint Sensor.

My favorite and only go to tech channel! clear clean concise ! Now oppo just need a new matrix movie to market it!

The phone is dope.

how about case?

I don&#39;t like oppo vivo gionee one+ and many Chinese mobile company&#39;s .... I hate all those kind of companies .........

Case for it ?😂😂

Very flashy and gimmicky, but I wouldn&#39;t gamble $1000 on a phone that will rely on a motor for almost everything it does. The fact that it&#39;s all glass also adds to the durability issue, while missing essential things, like a headphone jack, make it not very practical. I&#39;m gonna pass on this one. Still interested to see what happens with the Red Hydrogen One and Nokia&#39;s rumored successor to the Lumia 1020.

The design is beautiful. No offense but Samsung and Google Pixel phone are much2 better than this. Just my opinion.

No phone cases.Sorry😥
fuck the motor i wouldnt mind extending my phone manually to use the camera just make it so when i pull the camera out the camera app or snap chat automatically opens like a dedicated camera button but a slide instead of a push the motors likely to die anyway and a motor is just way to much convenience

No headphone jack and no finger print on back site..that means they will not gona have my money ;)

JESUS CHRIST  MY NOKIA  8110  WAS COOLER WHEN YOU SLED IT BACK IN THE DAY ...THATS HIDIOUS   UHGG SORRY NO WATERPROOF NO SALES

Fbi bois be sad bout dis

This is the way to go. Fuck notches. At first the potential wear of the motor for the cameras concerned me, but as long as you can pull the thing out manually. Which you can by the looks of it. Rather have that than a notch.

I, a big domestic, can finally feel proud for once.
ox
Chinese brands doing innovations 😌😮
How would you design a phone case for that?

you are so handsome and gorgous..i love you

&quot;This is madness!&quot; &quot;THIS. IS. <b>OPPO!</b> &quot;

It&#39;s tooo much costly

awesome smartphone

Superb Oppo Phone
Good luck

Hii

Yes give me

The main issue in my opinion apart from MKBHD is we can&#39;t use a back case or cover!!!!

next time your phone will transform into autobot

8GB RAM😮😮😮
i don&#39;t even use wireless charging because it&#39;s incredibly slow so i don&#39;t know why people hype it up so much . I have galaxy s8

How the mobile cover will be applied here❓❓

Sexiest Phone Alive

but... how does any case fit on this phone if the whole top has to go come up and down

Yay no more camera bumps
nova is a must for any oppo

Wow nice design love this one.

This looks like the iPhone x

<i>looks like camera opening and closing nokia 7650</i> 😎

Look I know a lot of people says that this phone is copying iPhone x I actually don&#39;t mind this I actually like this kind of software plus it&#39;s Android so you can always just don&#39;t Nova Launcher on there

I wonder what type of covers we get for this phone🤔

Great innovation but low quality. Better wait for another years.

the real innovation

Im only going to buy that if water resistant 😑

What about shooting a video about Xperia XZ 2 Premium?! Seems like it has a good camera. You don&#39;t make videos about Sony quite often🤔 Do you think that their stuff  sucks, or is there another reason?)

Rip resolution....
Would recommend a backup phone just in case.

I would rather choose HUAWEI , it&#39;s reliable than any Chinese phone brand

Vivo nex s is way better

can&#39;t use a phone case on these things

make a video on comparision of vivo nex and oppo find x... 🥂.. Bezzelless beauty..

Sony in the past had their cybershot phones with these kind of hidden cameras but not motorized but mechanical. Surprised that oppo delivered this

It would be nice if the ability to manually pull the top up and down could be preserved after the motor fails (as opposed to it failing in such a way that the whole thing locks up).   I would be entirely willing to pull it myself, if it meant we can avoid a notch-scenario.

Malli

This is really innovative. I mean can&#39;t believe oppo were they first one to do it. I phone, Samsung  little late 😂

Not gonna buy a phone that I am pretty sure will fail to click Pictures when I need to.

Copy of s9+ and iphone x. Which person is agree with me like here

All new box pack oppo mobile phone are available to in Karachi Pakistan.ContactSufiyan :0323-2153477

It&#39;s not appo it&#39;s OPPO

This is the first time I have appreciated a company who have always believed in copying Apple, but they have come up with their first true and worthy invention, I am sure lots of company are gonna follow this trend now.

Hmm... I wonder how much controversy it would cause when it needs a protective case.Nice thinking oppo...

First FBI less phone

thats called innovation. its beautiful, its creative. one thing that i want to know how much longer that motor gonna lasts

Good awesome oppo find x

I surely will throw money on it.. finally a phone which can draw me away from Samsung Galaxy Edge devices ...Yes.. it not being a dust and water resistant will be an issue but I can live without them. Also it lacks , wireless charging and a headphone jack.. again I can live without them too..lack of fingerprint sensor is a huge issue ... yes , it has this faceID like unlocking feature but I need to know how secure it is..So , yes I&#39;ll think about buying this device.. I want it to be reliable for at least 2-3 years ... and also it should be able to take good pro photos...!!

its Ammmazzzzing.....
How amazing

Screen or camera mechanism kamaal h guruji
Under 60K . Not a good deal Chinese phones 🤣👏👏👏
oppo find x......... Vs

<b>it's going to be shit, it's going to be shit.. it's going to be shit, it's going to be shit, it's going to be shit.. it's going to be shit, it's going to be shit... I just want to see when these devices start to have problems with not lifting the camera lol</b>
Future phone is here🔥🔥🔥
What is the benefite of face unlock..if u have to slide by ur finger....totally useless

Those motors will fail after some months, oppo is very bad in terms of durability

This is the beast

Wow amazing phone

Haha it cause so much buying it

Can&#39;t use a phone case huh?

Nice phone bro

This phone is awesome 8 GB RAM and 256 ROM i really love this phone

There is no notch 😄

0049-179-9334973WhatsAppBetter use Scotchtape on the frontcamera (double), remove only when You are using it, then stick back again !

“Lag city please update this software“😭

3800Mah Mobile battery running a physical motor to move at least 30g of weight every time you launch camera or perform face unlock. 🤔🤔 not a great idea I guess!!!!

super

hard days for samsung galaxy s9 users like me😕
with this you can forget about getting a case for your phone

💚Samsung 9💚
Classy and interesting design but motorised camera makes it vulnerable.

Awesome mobile but camera function is bad it takes too much time to focus

Wakanda !!
Cool phone ...If a phone has no headphone jack you have to buy wireless head phones right?

But but the first was Samsung

This is a crap,why dont they just make normal smartphone with better camera and performance

It will call lot of battery drainage man.... Bad thinking

Drop test?

Doesn&#39;t matter.... It&#39;s still chinese
what about phone&#39;s external skin? I mean cover of the phone will be open from one side

I don&#39;t know how durable this motor would be.

Find the value of X.... 😝

A phone which has more than 6.5 inch of screen..man that&#39;s way too much

this phone is gonna be fapping all day long !!!

Not particle
what is the price

I am going to buy it no doubt.

How to put back cover on this ?

Pretty nice job by oppo...They are really a capable player in the smartphone arena...

So u cannot use mobile case for that

Not a revolutionary design. Why the hell we want so high screen to body ratio, s9 kind of design is almost perfect.. This design will consume a lot of energy whole day getting up and down during unlocking device. Nor good for outdoors ,near beach etc as dust will enter the top portion and will surely affect the movement of motor.

Didn&#39;t we have slider phones earlier? I think grains of sand would have been problem then too.

etr

less subscribers than technical guruji

We cannot put cover on it and if it falls the entire camera mechanism will break

This thing won&#39;t have a back case possible

This version is being launched in India for $850

Idiot ass ...u didnt gave any info abt the camera&#39;s n all😒😒😒😒

it is going to launch and not that expensive..

Does this thing have a &quot;Notification Alert&quot;?

Wow I want to buy this one man

What abut the back cover for this phone? Is the company didnt manufacture the cover  for this phone!!!!!🙄🙄🙄🙄

I can&#39;t FIND my X.    :P :D

BC, my motor will deteriorate in 15-20 days.
Looks like s8 plus and s9plus

no, I&#39;m not a fan sorry!

Just throw away your iphone x and buy this

How much does it cost

The motor is rated for 50,000 uses. C&#39;mon marques you shud have researched that much atleast.

Fuck hater&#39;s 💥💥

Поздрав, I&#39;ll like it so... unique mobile phone. Nice 👏
It is a pretty looking phone with a really really cool feature. But life expectancy is the problem due to moving parts 🤔.

How to Indian price this phone

All glass...no case? That&#39;s dangerous

Hello dear sir, Please i request to you please give this phone as a gift.  I am from india and still i am using 3g phone. If you can send me this phone then i will pray to god ... Please give him lots of succes...

In fact it has fingerprint reader

Right

X is in sex

Wt ever it is its software &amp; phone body always look cheap  China phones

What happened with face unlock when we r in dark room

Awesome

Now think how it&#39;s back cover will be.

It&#39;s a great phone to look very good

What the hell is this?
What the hell is this?
No phone case , One drop, Motor is misaligned..Stupid design

back is look tacky...too gleam.

that motor sound 😖😖

How Much

How do you put a case on this phone?

It can&#39;t stay in your pocket as you&#39;ve borrowed it

Cool video nice phone

Interesting, Marques, but yeah that slider just to unlock makes <b>zero</b> sense !!      IMO, both the Xiaomi Mi 8 and the Vivo make much more sense than this one as viable Android clones of the IP X -- if that&#39;s what someone is seeking.

Come on NSA Spy on me. Muahahahhahahhhhh

thats somehow what all these big companys need to see. Think outside the box

Very nice phone but that pop up camera means a silicone protective case is out of the question and you are going to need something as it&#39;s too expensive a phone to leave unprotected.

Oppo pronounces O-po,
That you nailed. Watched a lot and thought it was your best review.

how do put jellycase on this phone ? 🙂🙄

Hey, does is support google play download?

that pop up thingy will be a pain in the ass sooner or later 😐🙄

Amazing
awesome vid man

this cell phone is a masterpiece that unites technology and art

What camera are you using??

No more sudden freak moment just by opening the Front camera accidentally.No more realization of my ugly face. lol

Reali soo nice
How mouch cost

It is a disaster ready to happen. Once that move up part is broken, the whole phone becomes useless. Also what kind of case can protect this phone? Underscreen front camera should be the direction of future full screen phone. The section of the screen cover the lens should turn transparent the moment front camera takes a photo, or doing video call. It is not perfect, but better than this pop up design.

We have seen numerous hydraulic versions of handset earlier under the Nokia Corporation. However, this is quite interesting with an Android phone...

Does it have video call featureDoes it have fm redioDoes it future Android updatesDoes camera is good at corners of screen.Does it has font change featureDoes it have free musicDoes it have low light imagesDoes it get too much hotDoes it have tv remote

Please do a giveaways

im curious on how people will design the phone case

Has anyone thought about the fact that you can&#39;t use a case on this phone  because of the motorized top ?

This phone is the kind of thing I love to see but I would never buy it!

Just call it iphone clone please

Madness

￥5000 RMB in China,about $700 USD.
Bhikarchot phone

how can you put protective case?

where I can buy this phone??

Simply I love it 😘😘😘

How can i buy a phone case on this?

FBI unlinked this video

Found the X!🇮🇳♥️

Whats the prise

What&#39;s with this trend of no headphone jack these days?

This phone have FP senser dude😣🙄

Dear Samsung,You can top this. Please do haha

This battle is who copies the Iphone more efficiently The design vivoThe camera xiaomiThe Home bottom slide gesture oppo find x They should bring their own ideas instead of copying others

Ha the iPhone unlocked faster!!

would be interesting how phone lens add ons would work with this

That pop up thing is really cool. Considering most people change their phones after two years, it should last just fine.

In the advertisements they are showing its screen full.

companies should do in display camera instead of motorised ones bcoz motorised ones risk the hardware

That thing will definitely put a curse on you

thicc

I love this phone.

This is a real big shit with this weird camera.

Oppo F7
Apart from the functionality it would be interesting to know the quality of the camera.

Embarrassing levels of want

Who notice that you can&#39;t put a case on the phone

Definitely a gimmick. Reminds me of the Nokia phone in the Matrix with the slid out part, looked so cool back then but when you actually got one it was like lame. BTW what&#39;s the impact on battery life on hundreds of motor operations, not to mention that noise... Couldn&#39;t they have made it silent?  And no fingerprint reader even on the rear? FTS. Even more annoying than no headphone jack (another retroactive step).

I love your t–shirt
Should get a good logo uInstead of the fucking oppo shitWtf

Bro need the wallpaper

The camera is inside my oppo.
Nice one of those days

amazing phone but i think its too expensive

Gandu

Fake and fake

BBK Electronics have clearly employed some cleaver designers. The Oppo (notch free face ID) and Vivo (under screen touch ID) phones are clearly first of their kind, and it will be interesting if phone makers follow their lead. Apple usually lead the way in beautiful simplistic design, but the notch is clearly a design compromise. Take note Jony Ive you&#39;re on notice!

Dat or ONE PLUS 6?🔥🔥
Looks like iOS..

When it be in Kenya

Its better than s9 plus?

Me Likie…
I&#39;ll stick with the galaxy line, samsung flagships have every single modern feature you could want and need with zero compromise.

Oppo find XApple phone X?
What about the phone cover? Will it make harder for the camera to pop out😝

Dear MKBHD can you please review for blackberry key 2

How much time will it take until the camera mechanism starts failing? a year?

wow

Why are there so many ugly smartphones. I can&#39;t decide what to upgrade to from my ancient lg g2

it is like a mini robot hiding behind taking a peek at you. XD

Face ID clone? Really?

this phone is totally insane , and BTW no mad hackers can spy and access ur camera , cause its blocked so , they own it.but the only concern i have that the camera motor part, how much it will last ? i mean i use my phone 24/7 so that means a lot of pop ups , secondly this movable part will be much affected by sand and dust , but it still cool and very futuristic i like it.

<b>Shitty back design and a shitty OS!</b>

4999RMB in China

How did you get this phone? I heard that it isn&#39;t getting released in the US only everywhere else :( I&#39;m very curious...

But in case of crash, user should pray!

Wayyy better than apple &quot;innovation&quot; anyday! :)

looking camera

You can pull out the camera manually, thats actually a feature, not a failure.

And then you have Sony Xperia 😂

cool concept but very interesting points you got there about the durability of this phone and that grain example was funny but true at the same time. No way this phone is dust resistant in that way and also after the history of onplus sneaking your info and getting caught, i am never trusting a chinese company again

u forgot to mention apparently if u drop phone while camera is open it is automatically rolls back in while it is in the air when i saw that i realise that is going to be my next phone !!!

As long as $15 Panasonic ear buds are available, I will not get a phone without a headphone jack.

criticism
wow that looks sick :o Apple, what you got? Look at that!It&#39;s just sick. I want it, just shut up and take my money

if the motorized camera is broken, then how we gonna unlocked the phone?They actually need some backup for that unlock like fingerprint scanner...also that lag camera app is another flaw...otherwise, this phone would be perfect

The fact the camera can be manipulated manually is something I would design into the phone. That way, should the motor fail, the camera can still be accessed. Simply pull up or secure it with your hands.

Like right away. I hope someone here speaks Russian
its cool to look at. but its going to be a broken phone with lots of complaints of the motor breaking. how many times does someone unlock their phone and do nothing in a day

wonder how cases work

Nice pice but what this price

Is the camera activated that quick as it shown at 5&#39;54&quot; ?

How do you design a phone case for this one :)

Can you turn off the motor sound in any way? I&#39;d get pretty annoyed by it after a while otherwise

Marques i have seen your vids from the time you used to get 1000 views, now your standard has risen up from apple, samsung you are now on oppo, great bro

So is it lag?

Can you try the Sgnl watch strap, it has bone conduction and I’d love to know if it’s worth the money, thanks

Any indian here 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Am selling my iPhone for that shit

Woaaah

How to put a phone case?? 😂😂

peace,,,,Hey mkb,,, which country do you support in this world cup???

Wow awesome....😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Dvd players and dvd drives open hundreds of thousands of times a year and they manage to last 5+ years

Too bad it want work on any network here in the US....

I been time finding X on 10th grade

Super

Fuck the phone..somebody just me that fucking wallpaper 😪

Hey brother can you gift that phone for me😔 please.

Epic

MKBHD when unboxpharapy does which smartphone do they actually use can you invite Tailosive tech please thank you

My reaction 😮😮😏
Toy of the year 2018

One Question, HOW WOULD ANYBODY MAKE A CASE FOR THIS THING? Maybe make a hole at the top....NO! The phone would just slide right off........ pls anybody reply me.... thk

very important feature of this phone Marques didn&#39;t mention in this video:  when the phone detects free fall, the moving part will retract back to its original position. very important feature!

Loving ir review..gr8👌👌👌
Stupid design as u cant put it in a case becoz u hv to remove it everytime u wanna take a selfie

Wow bro dude u have an legent man I appreciate it dude 😎😘👍🤘👍💕❤️
oppo.. 3

Camera and brands are going crazy with the moving parts

Price?

They should just use simple mechanism such as manually push and pull with slider button on the side of the phone. Only to make sure the reliability without worry about the durability of the motor.

This phone is seriously soo lit🔥🔥🔥

This actually looks pretty

Someone commented that this phone acts as a techno demonstration in what Oppo can do, and marked the beginning of new markets where Oppo wants to sell its phones. It definitely is not meant to be a volume seller.

So impressed with how far Oppo has pushed their innovation to the limit but the motorised camera, I don&#39;t think will last long. Not durable, just gimmick. But still, so impressed.

it needs a fingerprint sensor to save some life on that motor, i feel like if you&#39;d use the scanner to unlock it the camera motor could last a while

Ye I like Marcus better then Unbox therapy n Jack just from just switching straight from one to the other.....seems less false.

Damn, I really do feel bad for the I danely vain people that feel the need to take hundreds of photos if themselves and others every day!

HTC Droid DNA was the first to market with a 1080p screen fella!

leave these fancy things aside, CHINESE DESIGNED phones = SHIT

Too loud

This is what Apple should have done. not the notch nonsense

Did u beef up the volume of the moter sounds or is really that audible

This is not industrial design, honestly.Just rounded glass nonsense. Industrial design would be much less rounded, honestly. Like a bezel-less version of Xperia phones or something.And preferably made out of metal, too. So the phone can survive more than a fart in its general direction.

The software sucks and its not coming to America

Rip ui

Is the screen amoled &amp; curve?

its ¥4999 fun fact: when you drop this phone with the camera on. The camera goes down before hitting the ground.

I have a Galaxy C7 and I loved it, I need no more!  XD

Nice video

Awesome

Why would I need this? I can already find my ex on Facebook (as long as she keeps forgetting to block me)

cameras you don&#39;t need cellphone is what you need

Hi Marques please reviev ASUS ROG phone

So how much is that???!??😁😁😁

A giveaway....
OPPO HA-1 is the best dac/amp i have ever owned... but their phones... not so much...

Looks good, but I don’t think there’s no accurate protection for that type of phone. Dusts can easily fill in, rain water can eventually destroy its mechanism, and it doesn’t even look tough, thou... It’s definitely made just for fuss!

Lost me at &quot;no headphone jack&quot;

Can I have this mobile for free!  Am student don&#39;t have money  pls
