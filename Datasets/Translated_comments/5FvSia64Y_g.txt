MAMMY PAPA HE ,MERY JAN AGAR WO MARENGE TO ME BHI MARUNGA AGAR WO JIANGA TO ME BHI JIONGA SO I LOVE U MMMMMMUMMY PAPA
It&#39;s should be must seen video, as this video really states some important message for us people!!! And it&#39;s 7 years old video ... But still i find this really important message!!! Which we should understand.

Jab bhi mere papa ka call aata hai.. mujhe to red button dikhna band ho jata hai.. I don&#39;t know log papa ka call kaise cut kr dete hai

I wish I could relate to this video, my father has become mad.
That&#39;s why you&#39;re my favourite ... No one can replace you from my heart.. ❤❤❤

I agree...with this video.. when they left then we understand their importance.. i lost my dad when I was 18 now I&#39;m 34 and also lost my mother three years before..today we are so much busy on our lives so we always ignore but we don&#39;t realise what we are loosing..they are the God they do anything for us with their unconditional love..which no one else can do in this whole world..God bless their soul in heaven in rest n peace..guys pls do value and giv your time

Fullyyyyyyy relatable with me 😖

😔

Fb

I love you Dad ❣️
Lucky enough to get the phone call from both mom and dad 😊🧿

This is how it happened to me
i prays god that bb can&quot;t  see this video as his mom dad does not exist

His father looks like struggler ...but still sbse best character ..itte seedhe ...😊😊

You should never do this to your father.
Papa my love!
I can feel it 😢😢

Dhruv tara best Jodi in world
Bb video is awesome but orange wall pr chipkali dekhi?

BB don&#39;t watch this episode !😢

I Lost My Papa on March 20.. Yar Unke Sath Time spend nh Kia Yar.. Life Ka Sabse Bda Regret H That Wo Ab Sath Nh H.. spend Time With Your Parents.. They Are Before God Or Anything Else❤

Just called my father after this video, thanks Bhuvan.❤❤

Really love you buvan real story your father and my real life

I became emotional 😢😢
I started crying because of this video

Watching this masterpiece 100+ times in 8 yrs. Still perfect. Most beautiful video of his career. Thanks for likes😌

So true for my 13 kinda age

It&#39;s been years but still my father is my favorite hero

She has come and given the rule😅
I am watching it after 7 years

It was only I who felt that I was running away from my father. Whenever I have time, I talk to Papa near him. Everything was played as before in childhood, till then. We talked about the match. Looks like that. And yes, my photo 1-2 is also with my father. Never understood all this important
Brother, I mainly agree with you. But there are few issues in my story, my father was never present in my family. Necessities also come due to demand, but they are given away. If our father could not afford to wear decent clothes, we would have to eat and play well. I am not talking about some luxury. The functions that come in one year, Banda buys a lot. How much has to be done on a birthday to make the guy feel special. By doing the right thing, by talking, by expressing love, one can have hope for the future. Gave dad a chance. We are 3 brothers and sisters, we have expressed it but no change has been seen. I am about to turn 18 after 2 months, I have tried to do it myself, but it is the way it is. I am tired of my fate, there is just a game which remains silent, then when I watch such videos, the game wakes up again.
I lost my father 😭 last month 💔😭😭😭😭
Old is gold 🥲

This video hit me hard… I can feel the sadness for BB now..😔😔how much pain he is going through after losing his parents! We r with u bro❤️ you r a very good son..🙏🌸

Please remember the gardener.

LOVE U BHUVAM FROM THE SOUL OF MY HEART BRO AND I AM SPEECHLESS BRO I ALSO DONT SHARE THINGS WITH MY FATHER JUST WITH MOM HE HAS SAID TO ME MANY TIMES THAT BETA MUJHE NAHI BATATA NA TU AND MUJHE BHI BATAYA KAR BETA.. I NEVER SHARE WITH HIM FOR SOME REASON BUT THIS VIDEO MADE ME CRY I LOVE MY PARENTS I WILL DO EVERYTHING FOR THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE 🥺

Brother made me emotional 🥺

I still miss my dad&#39;s call.... said true ki sirf contact list me rh jayenge but no calls😢

Literally I&#39;m crying

I wish this video didn't make sense till today.
This is the first video that makes me cry  his other videos are funny

This is the only guy which makes us laugh and cry at the same time 😞

after watching this video i realized that i dont even talk with my father properly...as i am maturing now i realize that its important to talk them correctly.

The hardest part <a href="">3:15</a>

BB dear, you will rule sometime. Great video!
Sorry for the comment but nowadays we come for the news of suicide and all its not because people lost their hope it&#39;s because they don&#39;t communicate with their parents.Ek baar baat kar loge apne parents se na to kabhi nhi sochogeIf you ask what they want they will say only you and your life that&#39;s matters the most so respect your parents ❤❤.😊

The hardest part of this video which made me skip a heartbeat was on <a href="">3:15</a>

thanks bb vai for opening my eyes

He said everything right

I have learned a lot from my father.
Best video ever 😢❤
&#39; Papa to rahenge Lakin sirf contact list main &#39;  this line really broke my heart into million of pices 🥺  Kash thora time or bitata apne papa ke Sath 😢 💔

It is today&#39;s time reality we are giving more attention to those relations which are not real and our real relationship distance Increasing day by day  😢😢😢😢

<a href="">3:16</a> makes me cry

this is genuinely a great video with a great social message

Bro, I swear that today you are my God.
Dad is special

Babloo ji be like: Oh my God, what happened to make us happy 😅

I cried for 10 minutes, after watching this video and thinking about the sacrifices my parents have made...

The OG youtuber

I am 24 years old but I still feel very bad about how long my life would be without my mom and dad.

i lost my father when i was 14 so please respect your parents 😓

Till date I have never disconnected mom and dad's phone to receive someone else's call. The decision to disconnect the phone has always been mom and dad's.
BB love you

Buvan acting is so real 😢
I love my heart 🥺❤️
Sorry papa

Miss u abu ❤❤❤❤
I don&#39;t know why I am Cray

I would... I definitely would if he loved me enough to visit me even once in his entire lifetime, if he&#39;d think and care that he has a daughter, is she doing okay?Trust me I would

Always respect and love your parents we don&#39;t know what is the last day with them so love your parents everyday

What have you done? Rona aagaya😢❤
Heart touching ❤❤
I rarely cry while watching movies, serials , YouTube etc... But this time I bawled like a kid. Maybe because I subconsciously know that I have also been making the same mistakes which Bhuvan did in this video.  But I have promised to myself to never ever repeat them again. Thanks Bhuvan for this video ❤️ It was much needed to shake, awake my subconscious !

my father was dead in 2021😭😭😭😭

So true about the childrens now a days... really this video made me cry...Dil choliya bb bro apne ..sachai samne laah di .❤

My father was a terrible person, divorcedc, alcoholic and abusive, he passed away last year, and I couldn’t even shed a single tear, now, 6 months later, it hits so hard ki “papa chale gaye”

Yah video ful match ho rahi hai with my life 😢
i saw this video lots of time... and when ever i see this video my eyes got num😢😢😢😢😢

I am 9 year old when my father passed away he was in army so please respect your father i also missed the old days with my fsther

I love you people
Parents are best

this is the ability of an actor by birth he can make us laugh and cry at the same time Hats off ❤BB

Yes bro i am miss my dad forever ❤️
I just cried after showed this video 😢 i can feel the pain

I lost my dad when i am 5 year old so i can understand what is importance of fathers love

Please Bhuvan Don&#39;t change the thumbnail of your old videos🙏

Rula Diya we say bb❤loveu
aaplog jo is chat box par kar rahe ho in reality dikh raha hai kyuki shadi aur job me lage rahete hai aur biwi apne pati ke mother and father ki seva nhi karti aur alag rahena shuru kar deti hai doosri jagah par.

He never fail to make us laugh  as well as emotional

Nice 😢
Dad ❤
Are you the one who ruled everyone? Thank you Bhuvan sir.
Ultimate

Everyone tells each other about appreciating parents,what about sons and daughters,There are parents in the world who just dont care about their children and their will and their studies,I am from Pakistan and I have 2 sisters which are both the eldest,My parents poured their heart and soul into their education and marriage but when I am at that stage where I need to study in clg and university,they have told me to take a part time job so that I can complete my studies and they just told me that they can&#39;t afford to raise me even though my Father is in Saudi Arabia he doesn&#39;t send money home that much I started a campaign to help raise money for my education but people just tell you that your parents should be the one to pay for it but I can&#39;t tell them that my parents are the one making me take part time jobs and earm for my self at the early age of 16,I am not ungrateful but come on you did better for your daughters but you can&#39;t do anything for your one and only Son  Now at the age of 17 I am doing a full time job and making ends meet,I am not studying I am just working as a shopkeeper at a local store,The point is everyone talks about parents but noone talks about children and their opinions even though they are the future,If you read through this please whenever you see a kid just do something that would make him happy,you dont know what is going through his life no matter the age

I am seeing this video for the second time.. last time when I saw my father was alive.  Now I can relate to this video word by word.. so much relatable 😪

Why didn&#39;t I watch it 1 year ago😢😭Time matters.

Missed his call 😞

😔😔😔😔

Every line hits harder than salman bahi,s car

Bhai Dil ko chu gayi ye video
be happy with ur family jai shre ram

I wish I had seen this 5  years before

This called real artist ❤️

I never had the courage to eat with my father...because I didn't understand why he always treated me like a villain...because his voice was so loud...or because he talked to me at home. Hey...I don't know why it seems like a strange gift.
Best video 👌👌👌

Sorry dad

Dad is real hero of  children....🥰

Every boy dreams of hugging his father but he can't do it. But we love him very much.
Same Ab Baba is in my phone's contact list🥲🥺
I saved my father’s number as “Daaku Daddy”, and since March 14th, 2017, this number is in my favourites, with no call logs. Sach kahan tha “Papa toh honge, par bas contact list mein”.

bb love you!!!

Bhuvan You are such a legend 🥺❤️

It makes me emotional tears on my eyes 😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺

I too have missed my father. Papa was not the main person in my life. But the love given by my father is still in my heart. ❤❤ miss you baba. I have watched this video a long time. Baba thaa to sab kuch thaa 🥺
I still remember Bhuvan bhaiya, how he used to love his parents, but unfortunate part, he lost both of them during COVID-19 Massacre. Such a terrible loss it was! Om Shanti 🙏🙏

Bro, please make the second part of this video.

I think this is my story 😢

Miss you Abu Jin ka bap unky Sath hota h wo Khush Naseeb hoty he miss you abu

Friend, I try a lot to talk to my father and mother, but my mother and father do not talk to me, I feel very bad inside, but no one in my family has ever understood me.

I swear that if you cheat your mom and dad, you will get mine instead of cheating your mother.

Brother, I have been watching your video since 7 years. I still don't know how many times your video has been repeated. Normally I have watched your video. But sometimes you talk so seriously that tears appear in your eyes. Love you brother. You do more things in life main. And the trailer of your new web series is also very good. &quot; Latest news&quot;
😔😔

Wearing a muffler in this summer will happen here 🤣🤣🤣

This is heart 💖💖💖 touching video

This is heart 💖💖💖 touching video

I lost my father last year......ye video unki yaad dilata hai...😢😭

The more you lose, the more you rule.
😔

This is how I am...I have 1 pic of you but I am not going to marry you with my father 🥺..I want something for you, I told you mother. The father is still there, mother says that I am not able to tell myself what to do...@zakir khan is talking, I have worked for a while at home (mother) and this man says Darna hai (father)...that What has happened with us?
Last me tum aise de sakte the ki, BB chupke uska papa ka bate sun raha tha and then THE END.

Most emotional video. I ever seen

Dill su geya yar ❤️
Yrr me his Nazar Andaz Karun Mere to papa hi nehi he 😅💔Hoke v nehi hei. No one will understand how much pain he caused me. Par ro nehi sakta &quot;ladka&quot; Hu nh 🙂
I also felt ashamed while bathing near my father, my father loves me very much😭😭❤️❤️
🥺What should I do if I don't know who my father is?
<a href="">0:02</a> in 2016 he never thought that he will go to abroad but today in 2022 he prove that

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Love u bb bhai... Meet u soon♥️🙌❣️
I can relate this...😭😭😭 calling my dad everyday 😖😖😖

<a href="">0:37</a> / <a href="">3:54</a>

<a href="">3:15</a> , we can only understand this when it happens...

Your great sir
Bhuwan Bhai itna hoane wale kabhi kabhi kabhi emotional dete 🥺💔
I am proud that I don't do that🥺
Cellphone is a huge distraction for today&#39;s generation

I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t press like button to such a good video. 1.4 cr people see this video but there are only 9 lakh likes atleast there should be 25 lakh likes.

Connected ❤️
Make me cry🥺🥺
I love you dad
I am the same with my father.
Being alone is Not good. Ask them to who have lost their very close One.

How will Maruti 800 work?
Bhuvan is always to be my ideal ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bhuvna bhaiya, since father is a merchant of hell, why should we think so much for him?
Bb bhai is playlist ko continue Karo please bhai please

Bhai yrr koi nahi bol sakta ki yeh only ek boy ke avtar hai

Yaar aik bande mai itna talent kaise ho skta hai.......Hats off to u brooooo

Act of excellence 💓

He care about his parents  so much I wish they were alive 😭

Not every father is like babluji. Sometime father is such an introvert  That he praises his child in  front of him and disrespect him in front of everyone. Such a mean person he is sometimes.

When I saw this video for the first time, it was also 6 years old, it was breaking my heart like every moment.... You can do anything for your father but you feel bad for his life, you can't do anything... and do a lot more. You can...I still have the number in my contact number,,, But..... 😭😭😭
Dude this video hit me so hard...The lines were so touching

cried like a dog after watching this vid

BB Ki Vines- | Sorry Dad |

I am also very shy to talk to my family.
😭😓me ro on
You made me emotional man.
I love my dad and mom If my heart loves me, then my father is the one who gives me the support of my father, if you are not there, then you will go to darkness, even if it gives so much heat, but it gives light to the main. love my dad i love my dad i love u papa🥺🥺🥺❤❤
I am happy because whatever happened today, I mustered up the courage to go near my father, I told my father, pay attention to me, father, I want this, if ever that day came to my mind, then I would come near him, how would I go and press his pair. It seems to me that I must tell you what is the meaning of man. What is the meaning of man today, but I have also learned that he has also come to know that I have never come in his true meaning, yet I have heard father's words every time I have pressed him silently. You are very happy but you are not able to sleep at night. Sometimes you sleep a little but you close your eyes and come close to me and put your hand on my head and tell me how much you talk to me saying that son, you are like this, son, you are like this, you are like this. That I will never feel sad, that I will never talk to my father, that I will always stop laughing at him.
😞

<a href="">3:23</a>🙂💔
There is no food here? Papa, show yourself first
LOVE YOU BROTHER

Last dialogue is like a knife that kills my heart

This vedio make me cry

😖😖😖

Ig i am the luckiest teen who has been growing a deeper relation with my dad right now each passing day.....

No matter how important my work has been in life, it has never happened that I have not received a call from my father ❤️❤️🙂
👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😤😤🤫🤫AISI GAALIYO WAALI VIDEOS KYA SEEKH MILEGA BACHO KOKAL KE BHAVISHYA BIGAAD RAHE YEH LOGGAALI DETE REHTE NO MORAL WALI VIDEO IN ANY WAY🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Dil choo gaya yeh video bc.. hope you make more of these veg videos to be shared in family groups..

Not always  he abuses but gives social lessons. Never ever shout on your parents if they are not able to buy something that you want you just speak it out and forget but your parents will feel guilty I request

I can&#39;t imagine how Bhuvan is suffering when he made this video and today his father and mother both are not with him💔😖

When BB said &quot; Firr Papa toh rahenge, Bass phone ki Contact List me&quot; i cried that moment💔

Bhai tune yeh last ke line dil chu gaye

I am also 🥺💔
Hutiya😭
Today, after so many years, I am watching this video again, this video has enlightened me in a different way, I am a boy, we tell our feelings to our father, we don't get it. No matter how much work is done in this world by the parents for their children, the children are not able to do anything for their parents, but when we regain our senses or start our job or business, it is very less time for them to pass away. They too are with us just to enjoy a moment but we never say anything to Sharam that it is the worst dream of a son to feel loved by his father or it remains a dream mostly…that it is Papa. I also love you, I also wish that you are always with me at every step but I don't get it...
This video broke our heart 😭

Here bablu ji is not speaking , Here bhuvan is speaking ❤️

These type of video  people ignore 🥺

He lost his parents now🙂

Papa hero
Brother, you ruled a lot. (I love you dad)
Sorry dad😔😔😔

Really best video

Brother gave me the rule brother real father I miss him a lot
This is my favourite video of BB🥺💗

I told you something today that I love my father very much, I just couldn't see it. My father loves me very much, he didn't even see it. It doesn't help me. I told my mother these words to my father. Give that voice to papa, I couldn't find any voice, one day I had an accident, I called my brother, I called mummy, called papa, but first of all, papa came, one day, Papa took the Activa scooty from the barber on 28th March 2022 or My exam was on 11th May 2022 but papa made me do 100 work and took me to the hospital. The doctor told me that this is what happened last month. The doctor told me that father told me that he will not die today but tomorrow. I understood that no words can be used in the day. I love you only once ❤️ I love you papa ❤️
Bhuvan's habit of picking up his father's phone has made a whole web series today....
Pata nahi awkwardness ko side me kyu nhi pata maa ke to pair ase hi daba deta hu but papa ke dabane me very relatable content love u papa ❤️
I cried after watching this

Brother this video made my heart sing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The last line make me emotional 😭

It doesn't happen yaar 😭
Weird But i dont why my father died when i was born He died after 7 days of my birth  (2007 28 December) That day he died by Car accident He was going to buy me some toys and clothes . Now he is at god watching me. When he was 27 He passed away And i m 14 Now I dont how much how much will i live

Very heart touching video🥺🥺🥺😭😭❤️❤️
I am also doing the same thing, I don't have the courage to stand with my father.

Omg omg

I also tell my things to mom😭😭I don't have the courage to tell dad😭😭LOVE YOU PAPA ❤️❤️❤️❤️
BB play all character properly ☺Wow 😍

God did not give such a lustful father like me. He is such a bastard father and he told us right away that he was just waiting for my mother to die. And so it happened, as soon as my mother died, I was thrown out of the house and married another. I did it. Before marriage, he brought that woman home and kept both the doors of his bedroom locked and keyed. After the second marriage, he told me that this is his new life, now ours and our relation has come to an end. I have never had any contact with him in my life. Baa kare.Baap nahi dog hai mera hai.
Sir fell on my heart
Now he realised what is the importance of father Rip Bhuvan Father

This video is so good that I literally hated BB first time ever because of his behaviour in this video 👍

Very motivational🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂

Miss you papa 😭😭😭😭
Brother I want a video once a week
Literally i am after watching this.. no words to appreciate this man😢

brother why are you crying friend
Bro it was heart touching I cry but this is true. 😘😘😭😭 Love u brother from deepth of my heart.

From <a href="">3:18</a>

Achank se call ana band ho jye ga tab ho ga 👈 this makes me cry every time

This made me remind starting episodes of Dhindhora

This is a very emotional video 😭 I don't want to say sorry to my father even now my father is not there.
Can’t wait to surprise my parents in India after 4 years in Canada

thanks a lot for reminding the importance and value of the parents in our life.....

We love you bhuvanMay God give peace to your parents who gave birth to such wonderful child.You place a special place in our heartsLots of love BB 💞💞💞💞♥️

Bhai tera video dekke hashte hashte ajh me achanak rodiya 🙂🙂🙂

I am 17 and i have lost my fathet

This is what I like about him❤

My father is in my direct contract list😭😭😭
Really, the feeling of mistake often happens after killing someone.😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
This video helped me realise something 🥲❤️

I don&#39;t have a father guys but I can definitely say that papa always great 😢😊😇

We all appreciate our mothers a lot , literally a lot but we never appreciate efforts of our father.Just count the sacrifices your father made for you and then you will realise that you actually love your father more then anything

Aab to mere papa sirf my contact list main reh Gaye 😔🥀 miss you dad 😔
This is the Best video by BB ever.. ❤️❤️✨✨💗
bhai itna emotional bhi karte ho tum samajh me nhi aata tum comedian ho ya tragedian hats off to you 😇

Very heart touching Rula diya bhai 😭
PAPA REMAINS BUT CONTACT LIST. ME HE INDIRECTLY SAID IF THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF SHOWING ME MARUNGA FIRST PYAAR😢😢😢
Every time I watch this video my eyes get welled up

I started crying thinking that my father would have made so much trouble for me, I had just bought a new phone, he had given me that 20k rupees and now he had taken it again even though my father's job was very expensive or I could have made so much trouble. I can't live for them because of my friends. 😞 My mother scolded me for not giving food, she still scolded me, she said only for my sake, dear mother, father is real legends girlfriend boyfriend boyfriend Not even the dust of you but him is in front of him.
I litterly cried

MY PARENTS ARE MY LIFE♥️♥️💞💞💘💕💕

Actually you are right brother, I am also like this, I am afraid to walk with my father, but I have a strange feeling, I want to do it but I don't know, if mom is there anywhere. I can go anytime but I love my dad❤️❤️❤️Some may still be there. It hurts to leave my father but I don't know from my mother. It's like this only with me but it happens with everyone else too.
you are legend sir

After watch this video  i cry

You taught me something 🥺🙂

Background music name Please🙏🙏

Badiya

Jab choti chot lagti nai tab chilate hai mummmmyyyyy or jab truck se accident hote hote bach jate hai tab to mu se baap re hi nikalta hai na We all know the importance od DAD subconsciously but kya kare yaar pappa ke saath rahege to ego ka kya Pappa ke sath shopping karne gaye to me to cool nahi chota bacha lagugaJis ladki ko impress karne or uske samne baap baap bolke cool baneke liye baap ki ijjat utarte hai na ki mera baap yeh mera baap wo.  Usi baap ke pass jaoge jab wohi ladki shopping pe lejane ko bolegiSo know the importance of dad or REGRET for the whole life

Many of us are the still the same son  who needs to change their behavior towards their parents spclly fathers. We nvr try to share things with father but deep down we know we are wrong 😐😐
