There is a story of mine in my womb, there are countless things to be told, in the evening morning I searched for you, to know which mistake there is an old story in your womb of mine, I am watching the color of the sky, sometimes it is blue, sometimes it is red, sometimes it is yellow, sometimes it is orange, sometimes it is orange, sometimes it is yellow… You are the one who has always looked into my eyes, sometimes you have shown me, sometimes you have come, sometimes you will come, sometimes you will come to me, you have a story of mine, you have told me so many things in the evening, I have searched for you, I know whose mistake is yours, what is mine, what was yours? This place, whatever is there, is just for you, even if my soul sings happily, you will laugh so much, you will never torment me if you cry for me, I will never say anything…you will never torment me, if you cry for me, I will never say anything…you will torture me, if you cry for me, I will never say anything. Nahin…You are the only one who is waiting for me in my eyes. Sometimes the blood will come, sometimes you will come. Whenever I walk, you will come to me…It is a story of mine and mine…In the evening, I will tell you so many things…In the evening, I will meet you, I will never know whose mistake… There is history in my-meri-meri-teri baatein..

Find this masterpiece after 5 years .. Where was I man ?!!!!

There is a story of mine in my womb, there are countless things to be told, in the evening morning I searched for you, to know which mistake there is an old story in your womb of mine, I am watching the color of the sky, sometimes it is blue, sometimes it is red, sometimes it is yellow, sometimes it is orange, sometimes it is orange, sometimes it is yellow… You are the one who has always looked into my eyes, sometimes you have shown me, sometimes you have come, sometimes you will come, sometimes you will come to me, you have a story of mine, you have told me so many things in the evening, I have searched for you, I know whose mistake is yours, what is mine, what was yours? This place, whatever is there, is just for you, even if my soul sings happily, you will laugh so much, you will never torment me if you cry for me, I will never say anything…you will never torment me, if you cry for me, I will never say anything…you will torture me, if you cry for me, I will never say anything. nahi
