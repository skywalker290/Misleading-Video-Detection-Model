This trailer is Fawesome and full of thriller! I hope that the movie meets expectations.

5555

Since Madame Web is worse.Maybe Morbius wasn’t that bad after all.

this trailer held such promise....

Why half of the scenes are missing in the movie??

What music is this

I remember watching this trailer when it came out and actually being excited for this film

It’s insane that they released this over 2 years before the movie came out

It’s morbing time
Why is everyone laughing at this movie? I really liked it and I&#39;m not kidding. The movie was good . And the trailers for this movie are great. Overall 8/10

The movie that made Alfred Hitchcock weep and declare superhero movies to be true cinema.

What the hell? And the 1 million likes?

Is that Peter Parker

This trailer is better than movie

Not still afraid of the dark are you

One of the best trailers ever from MARVEL but the movie sucked to be honest...

When I first saw this trailer I was really excited for the movie. Morbius is one of my three favourite vampires of all time. (The other two are Alucard from Hellsing Ultimate and NOS4A2 from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command for those who wanted to know) Like most of the other Spiderman villains, i was introduced to him through the 90’s animated series. I thought he was really cool and but underrated to be featured in a movie. My jaw was on the floor when I found out he was getting his own movie and it was in the same universe as Tom Hardy’s Venom. But when I saw the film I was disappointed with what we got. I really wanted to like this movie. An R-rated Morbius the vampire movie would’ve been dope had it been done differently. But now all I see are people making “It’s Morbin Time” memes everywhere I look and it pisses me off. I hate the fact that this film ha to be postponed due to COVID and it was given a pointless post credit scene trying to tie him into the MCU. I feel like Sony hasn’t learned anything from their past mistakes with the Amazing Spiderman films. And with the upcoming Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter movies, we were so close to getting a Lethal Protectors spinoff with Venom, Morbius, and Kraven. But now that I saw the trailers the hype is just gone. I like the idea of giving Spider-Man villains their own spin offs. They’re just as memorable and lovable as the hero himself. But it’s not gonna happen and I can’t help but feel frustrated. I could picture how it would’ve worked in my head… maybe in an alternate universe we actually got a good Morbius movie and my alternate self is getting excited for the possibility of a Lethal Protector spin off movie which could’ve led to them all appearing in an Amazing Spiderman 3 movie 

10/10 would watch again

God what I would give to see the version of this movie before the pandemic

Borringgg I just wasted my time 

Yummy

Hello  beatiful
beaty is all around us, look forward to  seeing you Delovly

It is hard to believe that people were once actually hyped for this movie, unironically.

Best movie of all time!

This trailer was 100 times better then the whole movie 

This was such a great movie. I especially love the scene morbius where tells Peter that &quot;With morb power comes morb responsibility&quot;

god need yto get us better and usable computer 4 1nc

computer 4rcin us to be w helen keller

now dog learn what to do

now yu tell yur god to attack back cruel progresive and general commercial u unjust;ly made and sent

It's time to be morbid
If this movie was rated R, it would have had a chance. Movies like this and Venom need to be rated R. Like Deadpool and Logan

If I had a coin for everytime that I realise that there is something that is Spider-Man related with Beethoven music in it&#39;s trailer, I would have two coins.



Kinda weird that it happened that exact number of times

Have ses have ses

Best movie ever
its morbin&#39; time

I actually loved the movie. Haters gonna hate. But I like that

This is a trailer for a better movie

It’s Morbin’ time
The only thing they actually did was trick his fanbase into thinking it was an R rated horror with a spider man character but nevertheless

watching this trailer back after the film is actually so upsetting. genuinely wanted this to do well, and well...

Why can&#39;t Disney buy Spider-Man and retcon all these movies

How to take a second-rate comics character and turn it into a pathetic also-ran.

Looking back at this, I still think it&#39;s a genuinely made movie.

The best Morbius movie
It&#39;s morbin time

Something fishy?? 

When we thought that this movie was absolutely going to be the best of all time it certainly was

this would be better if Jared Leto wasnt a sexual predator in real life.

Morbius is love, morbius is life, morbius is a religion, morbius is god. Morbius is a multiversal god, and he rules every universe, Wait........you don&#39;t like morbius? YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR YOUR DISGUSTING ACTIONS, YOU SHALL BE TORTURED IN THE DEEPEST PIT OF HELL!Morbius created you, morbius created us, and i will not stand you shitting on morbius because &quot; iTs A bAD mOvIE&quot;. Morbius is the best movie. No one likes sonic. Sonic is shit, morbius is everywhere, everyone, anyhow, anyway, and any day

I commented on the official trailer and now i&#39;m gonna comment on the teaser trailer. This is the BEST THING EVER. Nothings better than morbius. I love morbius, ever since i saw morbius&#39;s face i smiled and screamed. I love this movie, sonic 2 is shit, but morbius is a masterpiece. When i once see morbius i will morb everywhere. I can&#39;t describe how much i owe to morbius, it is a masterpiece and i truely believe morbius changed my life . I will repeat what the channel elvis the alien said &quot;morbius is love, morbius is life.&quot; I love morbius.

This movie should&#39;ve been rated R. But marvel is being a bunch of pussies.

Is it just me or does Sony like to purposely make their movies suck?

Is a Morb or be Morbed world.

Definitely a movie id rate from 1-10 !

Thank you youtube for the recommendation of this master piece movie of all time after three years.God bless you.

Where Morbius gonna reappear next? I really think that machete is a reference to Kraven the Hunter&#39;s weapon.

Even in this SMSMCU&#39;s Morbius film, referencing the &quot;Mayday&quot; word to another Marvel&#39;s Spider-man character, Mayday Parker (Mary Jane Watson &amp; Peter Parker&#39;s daughter) ️️️️️️️️

I thought it was pretty good.

This looked good, WTF man

The movie

We can sue Sony for lying in the trailers now

<a href="">2:09</a> There was Tobey&#39;s Spiderman in the trailer, but I thought I&#39;d see Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man in the movie, but it wasn&#39;t. @sonypictures

What about milo?

I was only nine years old. I loved Michael Morbius so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I&#39;d pray to Michael Morbius every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I&#39;ve been given. &quot;Morb is love&quot;, I would say, &quot;Morb is life&quot;. My dad hears me and calls me a FaggMorb. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Michael Morbius. I called him a MorbCuntunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I&#39;m crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it&#39;s really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It&#39;s Michael Morbius. I&#39;m so happy. &quot;It&#39;s morbin&#39; time&quot; he whispered as he procedeed to morb me up. My dad walks in. Michael Morbius looks him straight in the eye, and says, &quot;It&#39;s all morb now&quot;. Michael Morbius morbs away through my window. Morb is love. Morb is life.﻿

Please let this be as good as I want it to be.

Actually a good trailer. Bamboozled I guess

FROM THE STUDIOS THAT BROUGHT VOUPOLLY POCKETPOLLY POCKET 2 TOY STORY

Morbius truly deserves to have been called “Batman” if there was not already some rich dude with toys calling himself Batman.

Deleting the scenes,bad VFX, Covid 19 and the post credit scene that makes no sense destroyed the movie.

Good movie

First thing I notice is how useless cutting your palm after seeing every bats simply ignored the actor.Then flash back showing the kid fixing a monitor machine using a pen spring without trial and error. It&#39;s like he have done that a hundred times for all the Milo&#39;s. The professor finally noticed his gift and give him an proper education. And finally, the crippled young Milo able to run down the stairs to retrieve his letter faster than the bully finish reading it.

<a href="">2:12</a> Is that the Timelord? The Doctor?

One of the worst movie comics of all time. Perhaps if it came out on time, in 2020, without reshoots, it would be much better

When I watched this trailer, I thought that Morbius had born in 1951 and that the rare blood dicease made him immortal, that made him to survive to this day, but his condition would`ve been worse, which leads him to try more harder to find the cure, but becomes worse: a living vampire.

wouldnt he have gotten rabies

this will be the movie of all time

I remember morbing to this when I saw vulture make an appearance.

All jokes aside the movie was ok there where some scenes where there was cool moments and if a sequel gets made people would pay decent money to here him say “It’s Morbin Time”

2 years ago I thought this would be a scary dark DC like movie but it was like Morbin time

Would give it 2½ if I could. Definitely doesn&#39;t deserve the 3. This movie was meh. The beginning showed loads of promise the latter part let me down. The fight scenes were decent.

Waiting for the sequels ️️️
Greatest movie of all time 

Its funny how people got excited to this movie before it came outSaying its gonna be better than any mcu films combinedIts a good thing this movie exceeds to the hype

Oscar winning movie

To be honest, This is probably the best movie trailer i have ever seen

this trailer is best...compare to another morbius trailer.....

well after 2 years didn&#39;t got the chances to see moribus in 2020 and 2021 but since in 2022 we did after april 1 2022 it was not bad it was so cool now they connect moribus and venom world to the mcu multiverse saga. it gonna be fun.

Jared Leto definitely killed the iconic role of the movie Morbius in the year 2022. He&#39;s definitely more than an MCU character in Sony Spider Man Universe

The music for this trailer is amazing!

I love his trailer

I don’t care what the critics say, I enjoyed this movie

It&#39;s Morbin time!

It’s morbid time
It&#39;s a very good trailer fr

Uhm, Actually..Morbius is bad

When Dr. Michael Morbius turned his head slowly as the camera zoomed in on him and said &#39;Oh yeah....There&#39;s alot Morb where that came from&#39; ASTOUNDING. What a movie.

it was here,a legend was born

When he said &quot;May the morb be with you&quot; I got chills. It had some of the characters and dialogue of all time

We should get the Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes up to 100%! This movie is 100% a movie!

Remember when the teaser was better than the actual movie

Great film Jared Leto was excellent 10/10 film I think it’s very realistic how they brought Morbius character to life lots of action suspense &amp; never a Dull moment.. must see film!!

<a href="">1:44</a> Ah yes, the average Morbin Enjoyer

MORBid

This was the most movie ever made. The actors acted, the script was written, and the plot is there

I&#39;m about to MORB!!!

Jared Leto was the perfect actor for this part he did a excellent job and he looked phenomenal when he turned to Morbius his body was crazy fit this movie will keep you on your toes lots of action suspense and fighting scenes Morbius is vicious strong and realistic looking it’s so crazy to see them bring the cartoon to life this movie deserves a 10 I hope they make a 2nd Morbius Film! This movie was better than venom versus carnage  A must see film there is also credits after the film! Best  movie to Own for sure!! Jared Leto was Brilliant ️ great story line on this film 

it&#39;s so funny thinking about how I was genuinely excited for this movie lmfao

I just saw it rn I loved it people hate it a lot but I loved it loved the slow motion fight and when he was getting shot at

Ain&#39;t gonna lie, I was actually excited for this movie when I saw this specific trailer. The music goes quite well and how it&#39;s edited is also awesome. Other than that...... Yeah .....................

It&#39;s great to see all those pre-morbius comments, the world didn&#39;t have an idea about what it about to withness

This movie is the hieght of cinema. The fact that it had actors, had a plot and dialogues and had an ending makes it one of the movies out there. I&#39;m happy this film beat Endgame and Avatar by 6969 morbillion dollars.

It&#39;s Morbin&#39; Time!
Why do they release films by people that no one asked for, and if they do release them, why don't they make an effort to hire a decent screenwriter? Well, thank goodness they released the movie because it gave us hours of fun, IT'S MORBIN TIME
I can&#39;t believe that we had to wait two years for this masterpiece

I hate when they put stuff in a trailer that they NEVER put in the movie, like Michael jumping off the walls in Milo’s house and obviously killed someone that he regrets killing

“It’s not about Morbi-me, it’s about Morbi-US

It’s morning time

Why is everyone calling this movie shit ITS AMAZINGONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IVE EVER WATCHED

I waited 2 years for spiderman and the vulture to be in this movie. Spiderman wasn’t there and vulture was in a post credit scene..in fact I don’t even know how tf he got there. This movie was SHI- one of the movies of all time.

Can hollywood stop casting pedophile, jared leto, already??? Wtf

IT&#39;S MORBIN TIME

Being a jokester is temporary, but going all out as a vampire will always be eternal.

Truly was one of the morb morbies of morb time. Can’t get morbier than Morbius.

Man, I still remember the part of &quot;it&#39;s morbin time&quot;. I literally grabbed the guy next to me and hugged him strongly. I couldn&#39;t believe it happened. Truly masterpiece.

This was definitely a movie

Spoiler:Michael Keaton only shows up in the post credits scene and it&#39;s Vulture from the MCU.

MORBUIS VS BLADE

Not only was it a movie, it was a screenplay.

This is cinema-Martin Scorsese

It&#39;s morbin time

If Beethoven was alive, he be copyrighting this

who would have know this would be the greatest movie ever made, that it would change so many lives, made countles morrbillions and introduce us to the greatest scenes in movie history and the famous quote &quot;It&#39;s morbin time&quot; (i use it every day)

Is he a hero or a villain

Wasted potential...if anything that&#39;s a goddamn understatement.

What happened to the Fur Elise References? Sony cut so much in those 2 years

I cried a morbillion tears when he said &quot;I&#39;m going to Morb&quot;.

fun fact: they want to use minecraft steve as an antagonist but sony decided that changing morbius into ender dragon is planned for sequel

<b>It's morbin time</b>"Morbius" is, without exaggeration, the best film in the history of mankind. We were allowed to feel so much of the brilliantly written hero in the person of Doctor Michael Morbius that when he said a phrase that became a catchphrase and stood on a par with the sayings of Confucius, Nietzsche and other famous philosophers and, I dare say, even surpassed them, “It’s time to die.” ; the whole hall began to scream, cry and applaud so much that not just any “Avengers: Endgame” and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; I didn't even dream about it. Personally, I, and all the people close to me, watch Morbius. about 5 times a day to touch the greatness of this film, which has become a symbol of the era. Every scene in this film is great, and no one will dare to dispute that. But despite this, I can highlight my favorite, which alone could make the film the best in the history of mankind, but since the rest of the film is no less great, it only became a bright decoration, a diamond in the crown, a cherry on the cake in the film. This scene is a dance of one of my main and favorite characters, Milo. The choreography in this scene is flawless, with every movement conveying the character's long journey and how he got to this point in his story. The actor's performance in this scene is a masterpiece, it deepens us into the narrative, and makes it difficult to breathe from the tension and fascination of watching. The actor will 10,000% win an Oscar for this role, as well as all other awards. Yes, the actor himself will win the film Oscar in all categories, and it will be deserved. Many people who cannot understand the greatness of this film will think that it is terrible. I don’t even recommend reading the opinions of these people. In conclusion, I would like to recommend watching "Morbius" to all lovers of high cinema and it will unconditionally rank with such masterpieces of world art as “Venom 2”. This is confirmed by the film’s gross of 10,028,918 million dollars. 1000000000/10
Funny that this movie has more blood than venom 2.

It’s morbin time

The scene where Morbius morbed all the enemies and said &#39;You&#39;ve morbed your last bius&#39; I legit morbed my pants.

Ah yes, this is one of the movies of all time. It has characters and dialogues too.

I dreamed about watching morbius in my dream and when I woke up I was dissatisfied with my life so I decided to take my life and die for morbius. (I will go to Morbheaven for this)

Truly a Marvel Legend! Can&#39;t wait for Morbius: It&#39;s Morbin Time, I watch this film for the Morbillionth time!!

Best film I’ve ever seen i even stared crying when he said it’s morbin time

Was the movie in history

Why many scenes were removed from morbius movie

ITS MORBIN TIME

Wow the “best movie ever”

It&#39;s the most movie ever!!!!!

It’s morbin time

Funfact: my granpa was get morbed 1 morbillion years ago

its morbin time

Very amazing movie because of &quot;it&#39;s morbin time&quot; and breaking bad references

Finally, a perfect movie. It even plays Fur Elise in the back ground.

This was before the Morbing

When he said &quot;i&#39;ts morbin time&quot;, that changed movie history

I love Morbius

Whatever the Movie Is. This Trailer Was Dope 

well worth the wait

It&#39;s morbin time.

This deserves 10 Morbillion views

Can’t wait for the upcoming sequels:Morbius 2: more bius Morbius 3: The Morb the merrier Morbius 4: Back for Morb

I thought the movie would be cool... for real

this trailer morbed me so much i watched the movie morbilion times. IT&#39;S MORBIN TIME!

This movie is so good i am just morbed my body in the theater

This is actually better than the movie we got

I&#39;m so sad to see this trailer again, after i witnessed the final trailer after i saw the movie some friend talked me into... this trailer would have made the movie look actually kinda decent.

Got the morbs.

this trailer did actually hyped me

If this was well organised and well thought of, it should have been a good movie.

i just morbed so hard.
<a href="">0:18</a> Shouldn&#39;t he be explaining how an RBMK reactor explodes?

one of the movies of all time. sold 200 morbillion dollars. the way morbius said: “it’s morbin time”, it gave me chills.

If you are back to this trailer ,after few years . Then you know this movie is masterpiece

The day the history of cinema changed forever when Dr Michael Morbius said those famous lines &quot;It&#39;s Morbin Time&quot;

Morbius Sweep

It&#39;s crazy to think this movie, this absolute phenomenon was foreshadowed 2 years before

He has morbed

so technically this is the real Bat-Man

Marvel legend 
THE GOAT MOVIE, I AM MORBING MYSELF OVER IT!

The trailer is better than movie lot of scenes are not in the movie

Best movie of our time the first time I watched it, it got rid of my depression

This movie really morb into a movie

It&#39;s morbin time

This movie made me morb so hard

This is a movie

ticket sells, scripts written, actors are acting, production producing, movie is premiered &amp; directed by director.If I rate Morbius 1-10 I would.Jared Leto really an actor.

Here&#39;s a fact: the chad Morbius 2020 is way better than the virgin Morbius 2022

One of the greatest movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Period

Sony had no idea what they were getting themselves into. &quot;Morbius&quot; became the first movie to make 1 trillion dollars, so as a result they are working on the sequel &quot;Morbius and Wong&quot; which is most likely going to be even better than the first movie. Other studios such as Paramount Pictures and Pixar have attempted to rival Morbius by releasing films such as &quot;Sonic The Hedgehog 2&quot; &quot;Top Gun Maverick&quot; and &quot;Lightyear&quot; but none of them compare to the masterpiece known as Morbius.Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Pictures Animation will probably be the only movie studios still in business by the end of the decade as they release Morbius and Wong, Morbius 3 and 4, and &quot;Morbius Into The Morb-Verse.&quot; Then the 2030s decade will bring us Morbius 5, 6, and 7, as well as &quot;Morbius Across The Morb-Verse&quot; and &quot;Morbius Beyond The Morb-Verse.&quot; Then in the 2040s decade humanity will go on to constantly re-watch all of the Morbius movies, and praise the fact that humanity will not be able to exist without them.

This is truly the greatest movie of the century. “It’s Morbin Time” will go down as one of the most famous lines in cinema history right next to “I’m your father”

The best movie ever and the first movie to sell 500 mortrillion tickets

The most movie ever

Definitely one of the movies of all timeIt has characters and dialogue

This movie change my life

Most scenes from this trailer were cut

It&#39;s Morbin time.

It&#39;s morbin time

This is what we should of got almost half of the trailer was cut from the movie

This movie was not bad at all it was pretty good...

Morbius hype then: Violence, blood, thriller, vampire, multiverse crossoverMorbius now: <b>It’s Morbin’ time</b>

Morb&#39;d
If you want me to do anything like a thriller, first I get the money

I can&#39;t believe that how they didn&#39;t use any of the epic soundtrack and the text animation!

why there&#39;s are since I didn&#39;t see in the movie

How many bats do you want?Director: yes

why was this movie delayed for 2 years?

Coming back to read these comments after the actual movie dropped.....everyone was fooled. This trailer was better than the actual movie. No Spiderman nods, Tyrese&#39;s character lost that cool looking robotic arm accessory. So many misleading things that would have changed the flow of this movie....for the better.

Who&#39;s here after the Morbius sold Morbillions tickets

With 1 Morbillions Tickets AndThe El Muerto Movie Is Coming It Will Selled Muertillions Tickets

1 trillion morbius tickets

A lot of stuff in here isn&#39;t in the movie.

It was one of the movies ever, just couldn&#39;t see it...

In the director's version of the film, there is a moment where Garfield with a camera is trying to photograph something, when at that moment Morbius appears behind him, Garfield senses danger, turns around, but Morbius disappears, the episode lasts a few seconds, but damn what a pi$ he is Datai
we have been living with deaths in our midst all our lives , why can&#39;t they know how we must have felt for a change ? Michael

Deleted scene for bluray
Can’t wait for MOREbius

Well is pg-13 is so post to be rated R but PG-13 is fine

How come I&#39;ve never seen any ads for this movie until just now?(Edit punctuation)

That funny moment when the teaser trailer is 1000x better than the finished film

Rip to all those who watched this movie lmao

this is the most trailer of all time

Morbius more like more bs. I’m sorry this is the worst film I’ve seen all year give the rights back to marvel now!

Who&#39;s coming back to the trailer for the best movie of all time

It sucked

it&#39;s morbin time!!!

Morbius is the movie that Martin Scorsese said = Indeed this is cinema ‍️

this is definitely one of the movies ever made

movie

One of the trailers ever made

Not gonna lie I know a lot of people didn’t like the movie, but I think it was necessary for future films.

remind me of Nightcrawler

The movie ever, sold 4 trillion and 5 tickets

Loved Morbius, seven out of 10

This is gopd

Yo

What a crappy movie..boring and really bad CGI..

<a href="">1:41</a> when your sick but take a cool shower

Great movie

It&#39;s so sad to see how good this trailer was lol

Who’s back to see all the nearly perfect scenes that were cut from this nearly horribly executed movie 

The trailer was better than the actual movie

best movie ever!
The trailer had more depth than the movie

You like Morbius
Romania. Many people believe we have vampires, but in my 666 years of living here, I haven&#39;t even seen one.I asked my mates back in the castle and they also haven&#39;t seen any, and they&#39;ve been around for longer than I.

This is easily the most movie ever

THIS is one of the movies, ever

Greetings to all!!! Hello!!!Morbius ended up scoring...!Now let's figure out what his burden is...Doctor, do you agree...!?: “It’s time!”

Marvel and Sony: &quot; Lets make a new different movie about... Mhhhh... oh i know, Morbius would be good! &quot;Dudes: &quot; This movie is bad, because Morbius can&#39;t be alone without Spider-Man! &quot;Me: &quot; Wtf is your problem, this is the story of Morbius life and beginning!!! &quot;Really... ?

If you told me that this movie is gonna come out 2 years later, i’ll laugh at you

I thought this was a teaser trailer not a whole damn  plot summary

Peak cinema, nothing compares to this masterpiece

What a disappointing movie

I enjoyed this trailer more than the movie

They CUT the Keaton scenes and replaced them with even dumber Keaton scenes

There&#39;s so many more scenes in the trailer than in the actual movie 

Kinda curious how they were going to explain Adrian Toomes before Loki and No Way Home...

I think Morbius should get his own M rated video game. And hopefully they would make him a supernatural vampire rather than a pseudo vampire. But without any of the traditional weaknesses and drawbacks of supernatural vampires. Basically making him a vampire god.

I wonder where that scene would&#39;ve lead to at the end of this trailer.  &quot;Whats up, doc?&quot;.

I would love to see this movie. The morbius we got was not this movie

Since corona many movies is already show. After two years in same movie they show up again.

Worbius

I’m not even surprised that it outsold Avatar and Endgame

Morbius &gt;&gt;&gt; The Raimi trilogy and Spider-Verse

this definitely was the movie of all time

<a href="">2:09</a>-<a href="">2:11</a>There are so many deleted scenes from the movie.

I didn&#39;t know this teaser trailer was released in 2020...

So this was really a bullshit trailer. The fact that Sony thought it was cute to include Tobey Spidey, Oscorp, Vulture just to make this film be talked about is disgusting.

God damn, Morbius was one of the movie I&#39;ve ever seen, so with it&#39;s cgi and dialogue

this is what edward cullen thought he was to bella in twilight

Wait we got a trailer for morbius in 2020?

This was the simplest superhero movie I’ve ever seen. You can tell how heavily edited down it was. What a disappointment.

They cut a Lot of scenes...

Bruh.. we waited two years and we still confused lol.

Anybody here after seeing the movie? XD

This movie should die years ago.

Let&#39;s see Paul Allen&#39;s BatmanPaul Allen&#39;s Batman:

I never thought I would get so bored with a Marvel movie

A dead channel.....
Marvel and Sony Realized they played themselves when they put Mcu Vulture in a Non Canon (At the time) Marvel movie it now  makes sense now why they Waited until after Spider man no way home to release this movie

FIRST TRILLION DOLLAR MOVIE

plot twist: keanu reeves is dracula

Ok ok not  much better 

Morbius, part human and part super vampire. Marvel did a good story about Morbius.

I just seem this movie it was fire omggggg

<a href="">1:38</a> batman v superman scene

When the entire teaser trailer was better than the movie

This fur elise theme song not coming in the movie

That scene with Keaton was definitely changed in the final film

After seeing the movie I can see that they cut a lot of stuff. Like holy this doesn’t even feel or look like the same movie.

yikes

We Live In A Society Where Joker Found A Way To Become Batman But More SCARY...

Honestly i like the trailer more than the movie

i came of the future to say that the movie is horrible, probably the worst of all the Marvel recent pictures



1 trillion tickets

The Spider-Man with murder on the wall has more meaning now after NWH

After seeing this there’s a lot they cut

Could’ve been something

2020 OMG…
Whoever edited this trailer should have edited the movie =).Overall a decent flick worth seeing, not as good as Iron Man, not nearly as bad as Black Widow. Similar to Venom 1 in terms of quality.

This is borderline false advertising

Jesus it’s hilarious how much was cut out

It was pretty predictable that this movie was going to to do bad

this trailer honestly got me hyped for a time

They went so full into the trailer that watching this now, i honestly loved the trailer more than the movie

I already watched the Morbius movie it was a very good 

Lmao, worst comic book film since that Catwoman movie with Hale Barry

Just came back from the cinema, great movie! Can anyone tell me the music, cause it&#39;s no where to be found. Especially the music from the middle to end of the movie. Loved the darkness of the movie and the music most!

I actually really enjoyed this movie, not sure why it was so hated lol. Thought it was entertaining, cool concept, and was invested in the 2 main characters.

Dont be fooled by this great trailer movie sucks

I love how there are soooo many parts of this movie that got edited out or didn&#39;t make the cut.

This trailer was better than the whole movie

the amount of deleted scenes this movie has bro

Anyone here after watching the movie?Whats your opinions? I found the movie not much convincing, but ya, it was good.

Have you ever seen a good movie with Leto as main character, exactly…Completaly 

Literally trailer is better than the whole movie , there was no need to go with a connection with NWH , could have just used the variant thing

The movie was soooo different from the trailers, felt like it was all a scam honestly

Sony you fucked us real good with this one. I wish I was drugged when it happened. 

Patrick Bateman: let&#39;s see paul allen&#39;s batman

Who’s here after seeing Morbius to look back on how much was cut out 

Holy crap this was trash

Midbius
trailer was 100X better than the movie

LMAO WHERE DID THIS MOVIE GO

False advertisement

Just fame back from the movie. I’m gonna give you all a minor spoiler:There are a LOT of shots and lines in this trailer that we do not see in the movie. It feels like these scenes would have added more depth and background to the story. Instead what we get is kinda meh

This was a good movie. I hate the flack it&#39;s getting. Hopefully this story continues

Damn the trailers were so GOOD. Why was the movie BLEGH. SO MUCH POTENTIAL.We had a great story from the trailers and all that was just dumped. I’m not angry I’m just disappointed dude :(

Wow this movie is so bad

Maybe high expectations was a bad thing

peak

I just watched it today it was insane

Rip

2 years till the actual movie comes out

So this is Andrew timeline.hope we get amazing Spiderman 3

Welp

<a href="">2:09</a> it wasn&#39;t Tobey Macguire universe at all. It was Andrew Garfield universe the whole time!!

This is the movie I wanted to see this trailer is amazing, but the results that us fans got was so crucial and disappointing. Do better Sony

Watched this in Theatre. Too much changes has been made from this trailer. Why? I mean there&#39;s a lot potential for this character. I&#39;m disappointed and hype at the same time for this character.

After watching the movie this is literally the whole movie 

Almost half of the shots in this trailer aren’t in the finished film.

Who is here to see all the deleted scenes after seeing the movie?

they cut that scene showing spider man out at <a href="">2:09</a>, I was hoping to see it in the movie but it still wouldn&#39;t have made it any better lmao

I watched this movie and I actually LOVED it !!!! I want more !

Is this the new batman movie?

Yo... this music bruh... i like it a lot... especially the dude humming along to the melody... that was very nice

just watched it, they took out or did not put alot of scenes in the movie

morbius was abhorrently dreadful

Midbius
The only thing that made us excited for this movie at this time was Adrian Toomes. How the movie actually treats him is insulting.

You've kept me waiting for two years. I hope I love it. Tomorrow I'll see it.
Worst movie

Bruhhh the end credits made no sense

False advertisement

Honestly this movie is good, but there are some scenes that make you bored

<a href="">2:04</a>

Tommorow release 

19% on rotten tomatoes..... not worth the wait

Waiting for tomorrow

How far are we allowed to go, to fix something that’s broken, when the humanity is worse than the disease

...bRz on tp of bRz...
January of 2020 wtf

The wait was worth it
Can we deep it is coming out Friday

Oh.. my morbius…poor 
I thought Jake Gyllenhaal was in the thumbnail lmao.

2 fucking years ago 

It’s finally here

Yoo That Spider-Man On The Wall Is Definitely Tobey Maguire It’s Uncanny

MID

At least it drops in April.

Who here thinks that this is its best trailer?

This is depressing,how sony made this sh t movie and baited us all for two years.

can&#39;t wait!!!!!!!

A few more days and this movie comes out! Will make box office history!!!!

This guy used covid as his antidote and moreover this helped him give him many superhuman abilities  (don&#39;t try this irl)

Two years ago lmao

Marvel releasing this trailer 2 years ago while fans waiting for Thor:Love and Thunder which is coming out in less than 4 months

<a href="">2:10</a> spiderman

<a href="">2:10</a> is that tobey maguire spider man 

God two years ago now it’s just releasing

Not watching the movie, everything they said was cap.

I just can’t believe Sony cut all of Vulture’s scenes and all of the Spider-Man references. The reviews are calling this film god-awful. I’m seeing it next week, and hopefully it surprises me.

another movie when the trailer is good but the movie is trash

another movie when the trailer is good but the movie is trash

This really came out two years ago damn 

Omg 

2 years…

You are THE BEST 

Good to know that the Spider-Man &quot;MURDERER&quot; graffiti and the end of the trailer with Michael Keaton will not be in the actual film.

midbius
Never knew this trailer came out in 2020, Bloody hell.

Lol it&#39;s Been 2 years

“Where is spider-man?” He was gone for two days in another universe

I totally forgot that he&#39;s a rapist. You&#39;d think he could find someone that WANTS to sleep with him..he must get off on the lack of consent part

Bro the trailer came 2 years ago and the movie is barely coming 

Anybody from 2022?

Out of all the trailers for this movie, this is my favorite. Music to this rocks.

So, Rasputin got covid?

That’s hilarious this movie still isn’t out

I heard the music somewhere...

What is the name of music??????

OMG THIS MVIE MORBIUS 2022 April 1st it comes out at The Odeon witch I am definitely going to be seeing it can&#39;t wait

TWEAKER!

Happy 2 year anniversary to this trailer

Good trailer he should fight Blade and Spider Man.

it&#39;s literally 2 years old teaser! 

<a href="">2:10</a> my brother normal spider man

I mean not going to age lol 

O you who have believed, do not let your wealth or your children distract you from the remembrance of God, and whoever does that - those are the losers.
What? It&#39;s has been 2 years!? 

this was uploaded two years ago, what?

Mom I need BatmanMom- We have Batman at homeBatman at home- Although I love the trailer super excited for the movie

I am seing This Trailer 2022 Feb 28

Jan 13 2020 damn it&#39;s been more than 2 years and we still haven&#39;t seen this movie

Wth this was 2 years ago?? Im sure i saw this like month ago. Im sure someone are ruining the timeline rn

It&#39;s crazy how this trailer came out TWO YEARS AGO, like what????

Who released a movie over 2 years after the trailer drops?

For my whole life, i didn&#39;t even know if this trailer really existed.

Definitely MCU

Morbius and venom is better than spider-man i think?

Marvel forgo 

<a href="">2:38</a> To see the &quot;Joker&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; together in one movie. I like the sense of subtle humor from the writers 

There is an Beethoven Fur Elise remix in the sound track 

Morbius was one of my favourite villains in Spiderman 1994 animated series.. i loved it.. i wish this movie comes out soon

This movie never coming out

His 50 year&#39;s old omg

Will this be part of MCU?

Bruh…. At <a href="">2:08</a> you can see Adria Arjona’s character Martine Bancroft laying on the ground dead or dying, presumably from a gunshot wound. How could they be so sloppy in leaving this in the trailer???

Well. Finally a film of COVID-19

Can this movie  pull it off I believe yes as looks like it was done well. Blade was good too but died out go figure. This looks like a better vampire character with much more character and more complicated in his direction of actions with good and bad.

Seeing the Tobey Spider-Man now from a trailer 2 years ago… 

The trailer released 2 years ago

When the hell is this movie coming out cause they said it&#39;s coming out in January 2022 now it&#39;s February soon march so what the hell is going on

Spoilers..........Peter Parker&#39;s blood was fundamental in creating Morbius as we know it.From Spiderman Animated series.

Great! Another Batman movie!!!

God I this trailer has me super hyped.

This trailer is the reason why I decided to learn fur Elise on piano

This is 2 years old?

Ake sangithe ape rathe thiyana chun pan vage

So this guy started the coof.

what is the name of the music please, it is a piece from a symphony?

Been 2 years haven&#39;t came out yet

This dude is the final variant boss

It&#39;s been two year already

so r we gonna see blade?
My sister was pregnant when this trailer first came out now her kid is almost 2 years old

Take Salvatore brothers

The teaser was released 2 years ago but the movie hasn&#39;t released yet.

This is  literally bat-man

I’m gonna keep coming back here

April 1st everyone
We all forgot this movie was coming out because the trailer was too long ago

3 years in the making and it’s still not out

I’m from the year 2025 and this movie is still not out

&#39;&#39;only in theatres summer 2020&#39;&#39; 2 years later. Crickets chirping.

Anyone saw that spiderman painting and writen murderer

idk if this movie will be linked with andrews spiderman or not, but why does it looks like the toby&#39;s spiderman in the wall <a href="">2:09</a>

At <a href="">2:09</a> you can see Spider-Man labeled murderer in a poster, so it’s part of the MCEU then?

I got so confused when I saw the doctor

Not to brag but this is the real bat man that I&#39;ve been waiting for

Hard to believe this trailer came out 2 years ago lol and we still haven&#39;t seen the movie... Excited to watch it on April 1... hopefully doesn&#39;t get delayed again after already being delayed for like 7 times lol

<a href="">2:10</a> it&#39;s neither Tobey nor Tom,it&#39;s Andrew.

Think it. Morbius is the real Batman.

The suspensful paino in the back sounds partly like fur elise

How far are we allowed to go to fix something that&#39;s broken? Until the remedy is worse than the disease

Trailer says that this summer but they did not tell what year lol

Truly at this point I think this movie it will be better if they cancelled, or the story of the new mutants would repeat.

<a href="">2:09</a> murderer spider-man is that Andrew vers

No way this way 2 years ago wtf

&quot;we live in a society,  where movies are release 2 yrs after their teaser&quot;

I have a theory, we all saw the whole murderer spiderman on the wall and the vulture cameo all of which go with the main mcu. But I believe that is simply a red herring pulled by sony. I&#39;ve read and seen that the murderer spiderman has been seen in Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman series, as well as some hints towards Oscorp, which is also in the Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman series. So, in theory, I believe this will take place in that &quot;universe,&quot; it being separate from Tom Holland&#39;s spiderman but still connected thanks to venom who was seen as being left behind, at least a bit of him, in the final cutscene of far from home. Perhaps the new Dr. Strange movie will show some form of him or even venom who is still kickin&#39; in Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman, just with someone new. Or maybe I&#39;m pulling lose ends and calling it a blanket. Who knows :)

2 years later... 2 YEARS

superb xXx

this better be MA15 at LEAST.

If u skip to <a href="">2:10</a> it shows Tobey Maguire spiderman

very nice !

spiderman
It was teased 2 years ago bruh

If Batman was bitten by a radio active Bat!

If they ever bring back blade, they could make for a cool crossover.

<a href="">2:09</a> is that Andrew or Tobey?

SPIDER-MAN IS DEFINITELY IN THE MOVIE

Jared Leto has just confirmed This movie has been held in The Amazing Spider-Man Universe !!

It has been 2 years already?

Beethoven 
Got pushed back six times dude ‍️
Happy 2 year anniversary to the trailer of a movie that still hasn’t released

Keep gangidius as hero

anyone above 50 age like these music??!

Morbius : I am inevitableBlade : Ehemmm, excuse me
Trying to figure out if anyone even wants to watch this movie. I don&#39;t. No one I know does either. I don&#39;t think anyone trusts the comment section either after it was discovered there are paid shills populating it.  This trailer only has half the views of the Eternals trailer and we see how well that movie was loved by the masses. These Sony execs really need to do some focus groups and pier review on movie pitches cause...damn. This movie has bomb written all over it.

Why does he remind me of John wick

He reminds me Michael Sin, Lucian from Underworld... So much alikeness! Jared is so talented!

In 2 days this trailer will be 2 years old and the movie still hasn&#39;t come out yet

<a href="">2:10</a> tobeyyy
I will be watching that only for Jared…Harris.

They rescheduled it.

Who knew this would come out 2 years from when it was announced

Praise the algorithm overlords

I can&#39;t wait to see this movie with my grandchildren in 2341

Remember watching this teaser trailer on January 13 2020 the first time and was Excited and Not  Upset and it is content and now coming out April 1 of 2022 Early 2019 I saw some of the filming started filming And The assistants is The MCU. The writing was done  in 2018 and Watch All The Movies and shows to 16 Now 17 This Year 18 Next’s Year

This movie  can be awesome. And it gived me chills  at the same  time. 
Beethoven - Für Elise , Looking forward to seeing this when the theater opens, Greeds

Coming back to this after no way home :)

2 years later still waiting...

This movie was supposed to come out when I was in 8th grade. I am now a sophomore in high school somehow excited for this. Still waiting. Always.

The fact that they teased Tobey’s spider man 2 years before nwh came out-

So it’s confirmed this guy is apart of the MCU and I’m guessing since that Tobey’s Maguires Spider-Man is confirmed in the MCU and they show his suit in a drawing on the wall Morbius is in Tobey Maguire universe.

Wow... Awesome waiting To see
cant believe Sony teased Tobey Maguire spider man 2 years ago.

,df hd sesjum
,df hd sesjum
Its been 2 years since the first trailer dropped XD

Jared Leto is very good choice to potrey the role of Micheal Morbius ️

IventusHome houses disappear like jumpers
The fact that i had watch this again because of the delayed. oh damn

I like how this trailer released before NWH started filming... but NWH is already released...

This is a Sony movie so it might be actually Good...

This movie got delayed for the 7th time I really Hope Andrew Garfield is in it because of the rumors because the goat needs to return

<a href="">2:10</a>

Am  I the only one who thinks Loki every time I see the title Morbius

To think that spider man no way home was filmed &amp; got released in between the first release of this teaser trailer &amp; the release date of Morbius

I guarantee this movie blows. those who&#39;ve read the books will know this.

With his origin and powers we can say that he is more Batman than the original.

Morbius has delayed again

did I hear Nas&#39;s I Can? XD

didn’t the first trailer come out in like 2020? its now been two years of delays lmao

Keanu Reeves as Michael Morbius Would have been so much more worth the wait

how have i just realised this trailer existed. i watched the other trailer a while ago and only now found out that there was a teaser trailer released 2 years ago

The WEREWOLF is coming!

Morbius being delayed to April gives them enough time to add Andrew Garfield into the movie.

how do we know for sure that&#39;s Adrien Tooms tho

This movie is still not released

The first teaser trailer is TWO YEARS OLD at this point and this movie just got delayed to April 1.  my expectations are low but come on!

The trailer released 2 years before the movie looooool nice one 

This teaser is gonna be 2 years old already and you&#39;ll seriously going to push it back and delay the damn thing again?wtf Sony

Well seems like it’s gonna be delayed yet again. Almost a year and a half later and now we gotta wait til April lol

Delayed because Andrew cameo calling it rn

Movie got delayed to April 1st, 2022

Another Delayed 

<a href="">0:44</a> bee dee dum

I think this is an R rated movie just look at that creepy vampire sheesh

Now this is getting interesting. This movie was always getting released long before No Way Home. So, that Spidey on the wall could have been a placeholder to not spoil a surprise ( that the movie happens in the MCU because Tom Hollands Spidey has been framed by Mysterio ). In the final movie, perhaps that Raimi Spidey pic would have veen edited to give place to the real one in film. Now that No Way Home got released and we all know Venom came back to his universe, either Morbius will be something different or we&#39;ll be dealing ith multiverse shenanigans. Dr Strange perhaps created a whole new reality now sharing elements from other universes. Maybe that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing so many stuff from different Spidey movies.

<a href="">2:10</a>

<a href="">2:12</a> OMG is that Doctor !!!!!

My theory is that they’re still setting up the sinister 6 for amazing 3 and possibly even another movie with the 3 spider-men!!!

<a href="">2:09</a> wtf is PS4 raimi spider man suit doing there??

Dude look at <a href="">2:10</a> , why the hell is tobey&#39;s spiderman murderer!

I saw this trailer in the theater while going to see the new Spiderman movie and all I focused on was the fact that Matt Smith&#39;s in it and he&#39;s not wearing a bow tie. It just feels weird.

Wowwww white people areeee vampires

Is Morbius and Venom in the same universe as TASM ?? Andrew Garfield and Tom Hardy needs to happen

I accept spiderman with 4 extra arms and lizardman to make some appear here in the movie.

I think Morbius will enter Andrew Garfield&#39;s Spiderman universe instead of Tom Holland.

The trailer was out in 2020 and the movie it&#39;s to 2022 that&#39;s terrible marketing

<a href="">0:56</a>That well known piano sound in background 

Hmm. More Comic-book crap to keep Snowflakes in a delusional world

my boy toby almost broke character there

Was waiting from 2020

Nice!

It looks so DC movie and I like it. 

worked
Good day, Viktor Anatolyevich Litvyakov asked that you release this film ahead of schedule!
Idk why but I love the parts where he sings with the music

<a href="">2:10</a> that’s tobey’s Spider-Man

<a href="">2:09</a> Anyone else notice that&#39;s Tobey&#39;s Spider-Man?

This remix Fur Elise is the perfect song for this character......

For people that are confused, Adrian Toomes AKA Vulture from SM Homecoming is in this movie.  Which means that Morbius is in the MCU.  They also show a picture of Tobey&#39;s Spider-Man with &quot;Murderer&quot; sprayed across it in this trailer, which not only means that this film takes place after No Way Home, but also that Tobey is now in the MCU.  The only question is if/when he will show up again.  Also, since they showed Venom watching Holland&#39;s Spider-Man on TV at the end of Venom 2, it only makes sense that Maguire&#39;s, Garfield&#39;s, and Holland&#39;s Spider-Man, as well as Morbius, Venom, and Vulture are all connected.  That is to say, they are all in the MCU.  Why else would they show Keaton&#39;s Vulture in the Morbius movie and Holland&#39;s Spider-Man in Venom 2?

Please let this be in MCU .... don&#39;t destroy the characters ..... you all guys are same as fox ..as they shit you will too

<a href="">2:09</a> thats tobby maguire spider-man pic on the wall so i think this movie gonna take place in raimi verse the 1st spiderman if it is its gonna be huge

Come here after no way home

After watching No Way Home and comeback to watch this trailer, I just realized that The Spider-Man poster on the wall would likely be edited and it must be a newest version of Tom&#39;s Spider-Man. It&#39;s all make sense now.

Tobey &amp; Andrew coming back after No Way Home? 
Tobey coming back after No way home then? 

Today I watched SMFFH now this trailer makes more sense then any other

Zzz
Spidey&#39;s poster branded murderer and the multiverse appearance at the end of venom huh... looks like marvel is going all out on this one.

This guy is batman and nightcrawler combined I swear

Wow

He says I am venom and there’s a poster of Toby maguires Spider-Man having murder sprayed on it so that could means that this takes place after Spider-Man no way home

<a href="">2:41</a> it&#39;s vulture wow that means their will be a crossover just like in the comic books again i think i am starting to feel like a teenager all over and not turning into a middle age man soon

&quot;SUMMER&quot; lmao nahhhh
10 days until Spider-Man: No Way Home

Pastor &amp; Morbius = Pastor &amp; Daredevil

The Spider-Man on the wall makes it seem like this is in the Sam raimi  Spider-Man universe seeing as they’ve now decided to create the multiverse with sony 

Everyone forgot about this was even a film. They could&#39;ve just released it in February 2020 itself before all chaos besides waiting 2 whole years

Ok, I’m excited for this even though I still don’t know much background about this character. Seeing vulture and Matt Smith in this was a surprise too.

POV: you forgot this movie exosted

which universe he has?Tom Holland?or Tobey?i saw a poster of Spiderman of Tobey version on the wall from this trailer

this looks awful

<a href="">2:10</a> the Spider-Man image shown is Tobey’s suit

We are Venom 
Came her for beethoven ... Again .... !

FOR ELSIE.
The Living Vampire

Batman
We already have Covid-19 because of a Bat and now this 

this is what we call a true batman

Is Joker controlling bats now? I am lost...

Modern remix of Fur Elise is just noice

Then: Echo locationNow: bat radar Really?!

<b>OK, who&#39;s stopped by from Cory Barbee/Jonathan Kleck&#39;s channel. Peace &amp; grace.</b>

Dr Who&#39;s in it. Must be good.

Is morbius friends with Angel or Spike?

Blade batman john wick lookin dapper innit
Question: What is that song?

That music makes me watch the trailer again n again... Its very addictive 

Just gonna tell ya guys, hes in the MCU, and there&#39;ll be a scene where he converses from the Vulture from Spiderman: Homecoming.

Eren Yaeger
<a href="">2:10</a> Spider-Man on the wall it says murderer so could it be

Hmmm . . . is this going to be the post-credit for No Way Home? No references to it in the new trailer, and Keaton says he&#39;s not in NWH, but he is in this . . .

<a href="">2:09</a> I know you 
after this moviefake one with bat reference = BatmanReal batman who has bitten by bat = Morbius

Too many Hints that indicates Morbius in NWH

you can see spiderman on the wall in <a href="">2:09</a>

This the early movie trailer probably!

Morbius Third Trailer Dropping In Late December

Music for Adele ️
That bgm ️
I&#39;m Bat Man

Okay now at least we have a better version of batman

This teaser trailer is really very good
Jared Leto used to play Joker in suicide squad

The blood is dripping

Tom Holland&#39;s Spidey is gonna be f*cked up for sure.

John Wick but Morbius version.

I heard fur Elise

Thats Man Bat

I feel like Sony will be marvel&#39;s outlet for making movies on some of the darker heroes and antiheroes that they can&#39;t really make because of the Disney brand marvel has stuck on them

cool

Coldplay-Clocks &quot;am i a part of the cure, or am i a part of the disease?&quot;

So basically they copy Dracula

WOW IT&#39;S AMAZING I&#39;m excited to see the film by the way what&#39;s the song name can ooze anyone tell me

If Batman actually had super powers.

Is it just me or is Jared Leto looking more like Rasputin as time goes on

<a href="">2:09</a> end credit scene of NWH

<b>...Because I&#39;m Batman!</b>
Joker as batman.....

<a href="">2:08</a> just realised that Spiderman has silver linings on his suit, and I remember only Andrew Garfield Spiderman or Tobey Maguire had that type of suitIn the new morbius trailer, they also said he&#39;s been gone for 2 months, maybe the same way venom was brought into the Spiderman universe in the post credits of venom let there be carnage

THIS TRAILER AND THE COMMENTS AGED SO WELL

Ok, am I the only person who saw Matt smith at <a href="">2:12</a>?

The urge to consume nut

I thought bat-man was a DC movie.

Morbius : &quot;We live In a society, Where honor Is a distant memory, Isn&#39;t right, Blade? &quot;

Bat man 
I&#39;m sorry but Jared Leto is an awful choice.  Such a shit person.

<a href="">2:10</a> sam raimi spidey on wall with the word Murderer on it

another one for the manchildren

&quot;Fur elise&quot; as background music makes it more daunting 

Nandor looking vicious in this one.

This is Marvels Batman 

Why no subtitles?
This movie is copy by DC universe batman ... please marvel makes some original movie and content 

Are they going to do the whole Rise of the Midnight Sons arc?

Wait! I saw a trailer last week with Robert Pattinson in it!

<a href="">2:11</a> you’re welcome
The character of Morbius can also be glimpsed in the bonus features of the Blade (1998) DVD, in a deleted ending.Matt Smith joined the film, after previously turning down other superhero film roles, due to director Daniel Espinosa&#39;s involvement and encouragement from his former Doctor Who co-star Karen Gillan, who portrays Nebula in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The third film in Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universes (SSU).Leto was rumored for another vampire role, Lestat in Josh Boone&#39;s failed Vampire Chronicles reboot.The film&#39;s director Daniel Espinosa directed the Sci Fi movie &quot;Life&quot; which was rumoured to be a prequel to Venom (2018).F. Gary Gray and Antoine Fuqua turned down the offer to direct.This is Jared Leto&#39;s second comic-book role, after playing the Joker in Suicide Squad (2016).According to late comic book writer Gil Kane, the look of the original Marvel Comics character Morbius was based on actor Jack Palance. Palance portrayed Carl Grissom in Batman (1989) and his character is killed by the Joker (Jack Nicholson). Jared Leto played the Joker in Suicide Squad (2016) and Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League (2021) and Michael Keaton portrayed the titular Batman (1989).With this movie both Jared Leto and Michael Keaton will have played characters from both DC and Marvel. Leto in Suicide Squad as The Joker and the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, while Keaton will have participated both in this universe as well as the MCU and as the titular Batman in the DC Film Universe.Matt Smith (Loxias Crown/Hunger) had previously played Doctor Who. The Doctor had faced off with a rival Time Lord named Morbius in 1976, in the Doctor Who (1963) four-parter &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;.The New York scenes were actually filmed in Manchesters Northern Quater, UK. All city lights, signs and license plates etc were changed to match to those you&#39;d find in New York.This is Jared Harris&#39;s second comic-book role, after Tales of the Black Freighter (2009).

taradiratandadun
Marvel is the best 

Yo tell marvel to RELEASE TI AFREE ON THE THING U R SAYING AND POSY IT

Who&#39;s here after the latest trailer arrived?

Apart from the music, I love the trailer

Damn Sony have a roster of most amazing actors as spiderman villians, Jared Leto as Morbius, Tom Hardy as Venom, Michael keaton as Vulture, Alfred molina as Doctor Octopus. They have better actors for the villian than the role of spiderman, I mean Tom Holland is a noob have a lot to prove as an actor.

<a href="">2:10</a>Is it just me or the spiderman image in that scene in the background is that of Tobey Maguire&#39;s 

Horrible trailer

Oh, it&#39;s finally coming! I have been waiting for this since that first trailer. I am so there! PS Always knew Leto was a vampire. That or Jesus :-p

Iconic
omg

We all know what happens when humans and bats come together 

Matt Smith ️
Dr Morbius was probably part of that whole Yale thing...

&quot;From the studio who brought you Spiderman homecoming&quot;. Nice try. There&#39;s a reason both the Venom movies were  and Spiderman Homecoming &amp; Far from Home weren&#39;t. &quot;Marvel&quot;

My Theory : As you can notice that all Marvel movies and shows in recent times are focusing on the Supernatural stuff like Marvel Zombies, Scarlet Witch, Agatha Harkness, Darkhold, Blade and now Morbius and Hunger, and it is rumoured that Ghost rider gonna appear in the Dr.Strange : Multiverse of Madness.I think the sudden appearance of all these things are due to a Higher Demon like &quot;Mephisto&quot; or &quot;Nightmare&quot;.PS: Sorry for my grammar, English is my Second language:)

i think morbius is much  batter than batman

Michael Keaton: “You’re a bat man, but you’re not a Batman.”

English trailer is more powerful than hindi dubbed

I saw both raimi and mcu reference

He is getting superpowers from bat and here we are... getting corona from it

if Bats gave power ; Then China would have been most powerful.

We want no way home 2nd trailer 

We all totally missed that Spiderman tobey maguire at <a href="">2:10</a> ,untill the hype from  NWH&#39;s rumors and  official trailer coming out today .Why???

It literally looking like a horror movi

Experimenting on bats i see... I say it&#39;s exactly what we want in covid 19

He said whats up doc? maybe bugs bunny will be in the movie

MORBIUS- &quot;I&#39;m Venom!&quot;VENOM- &quot;I will not share my chocolate with you.&quot;

The real batman

<b>Beethoven&#39;s Fur Elise.!!</b> 
I love the way Matt Smith has got his little Doctor walk on 

that soundtrack...aaaaa, amazing bruh, can&#39;t wait for the movie

What is the name of bgm?

I thought this movie came out awhile ago

Goosebumps 
Batman and Bat man

real id is that batman
Please release tamildub

This is going to be a awesome movie

Sony is confirming that morbious is the reason behind Corona

Use of Fur Elise is awesome in the trailer

they should have kept mozart in the second trailer as well

Audience:- In which universe this movie&#39;s gonna take place?Sony:- YES.

Watching it after the official trailer launch.xD

<a href="">2:09</a> spiderman spotted

Morbius is finally getting released it&#39;s about time!!!!!!!

Just like Trump said - “until the remedy is worse than the disease  “ talked about Lockdowns and Covid… see where Biden has brought us? To the brink of nothingness.. no new cars, endless waits for goods and merchandise.. the remedy IS worse than Covid… and we’re living proof. The world is worse off now than before. Gas and everything has gone up 50%…. Remember, you voted for that asshole in office. Don’t make the same mistake 3 years from now.

me: is this a marvel movie?marvel: yesn&#39;t

Murderer 
Batman Real ID is here!!️
Wait a damn year for a second trailer and I&#39;m not disappointed at all

Mount up for Morbius. James Willems is probably ecstatic. Especially with the CGI 

From the studio that brought you Amazing Spid... oh we don&#39;t talk about this one, do we ?

Please be Rated R!!!!!!!!

This is absolutely insane, two years later will the movie be released. Wow, time flies but damn!

Finally Trailer is coming

YEAYESYAYYEAH!!!

So...his power is Covid-19???Love the Fur Elise remake 

Morbius the Living Vampire made a cameo appearance in a deleted scene from the 1998 live-action film Blade, portrayed by director Stephen Norrington. The scene was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release. Marvel Entertainment denied Blade II director Guillermo del Toro the rights to use the character.

One year ago!?

With this movie both Jared Leto and Michael Keaton will have played characters from both DC and Marvel. Leto in Suicide Squad as The Joker and the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, while Keaton will have participated both in this universe as well as the MCU and as the titular Batman in the DC Film Universe.

So no ones going to talk about tobeys spiderman in the background?

so morbious teaser trailer was released one year before the main trailer today, so NWH teaser....

Wow 1 year

I just found put this teaser existed

Just remind me of Dettlaf van der Eretein
So Joker loved Batman soo much that he became a Bat

Hey everyone. I have to be honest Jared Leto looks really great in this role. The teaser trailer wasn&#39;t bad but it did not hype me up or anything. But this trailer made me feel more excited for the film. I like what I am seeing. CGI looks good and i am liking the tone. I do find it funny they use the Sam Raimi spider-man suit and its a shot from the Spider-Man PS4 or PS5 game. Regardless I like the references to Venom and showing Michael Keatons Vulture. This looks super interesting. Hopefully this film will be a good one.

The best part of the this trailer is the classical vampire music

Why am I just now hearing about this movie???

I wish they stick to this track for the movie instead the one used in new trailer.... this one just slaps.

So he&#39;s COVID-19 Man?

Last time man got close to bat we got Covid. This new variant seems promising

‘ I am venom’
That piano clean as fuk

This trailer is better than the 2nd one

Morbius is corona ka baap 

Is that Fur Elise in the background?

joe mama

who else noticed fur Elise playing in the backgroud

Who else is here that Morbius returned

Who&#39;s here after sony released its trailer after 1 year !

Damn sony this universe has fast and furious as well!?!

they better not kill tyrese gibson or else a bald guy with a car gonna show up.

it is promising than Venom 2 and eternals trailer too.

Who else noticed spiderman poster on trailer

STOP CUTTING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND FOR BLOOD. I mean, you use your palm alot.....

Does this mean they couldn&#39;t fix the multiversal issues?

Let&#39;s see Michael Morbius card.

This looks so bad,  like a fan -made trailer. Yikes

Mobius makes more sense than bat man..

I prefer this version to the last one!

Morbius, Dorpheus, OrpheusGo eat some walrusesOrifices, PorridgesMorbius, MorbiusGoing to the Buffet and WalrusesCorpheus, CorpsesesWorcestershire sauceGo into your orificesRed pill, blue pillMorbius, WalrusesSeashells by the SeashorpheusMorbius drinking a forty in a death basket!

THE MUSIC IN THIS VIDEO IS REALLY AWESOME

I told you Batman is in MCU

Wtf is doctor who doing there is the real question

first

I’m really confused. So by the newspaper and the mentioning of San Francisco and venom you would assume it’s in the Sony verse. But then you see Adrian Toomes. Which would indicate he’s in the MCU. Idk it seems like don’t use just going to use Disney till they get a large enough universe made then just take back there characters all together

Now that tobey&#39;s spiderman is on NWH that poster behind morbius makes sense.

Yessss

Covidman

The most generic marvel capeshit ever

Is this on the mcu

Morbius: I am Venom.Venom: l am Looser.
Who&#39;s came here after watching the new trailer 

Oo

I thought trailer is released today 2 Nov,2021

Can I like this twice?

I know why you pressed &quot;Newest First&quot; .

I love that they&#39;re playing fuer elise in the background while he&#39;s turning into a vampire 

This trailer is better than the new one
Who is here after the second trailer

Beethoven music. Wow.
Blade

TASM verse movie, please release in Indian languages including Telugu,Tamil, Malayalam,Kannada,Hindi 

Imagine a cameo of....TOBEY

If marvel creates something, it relates with the main MCU (our lovely universe)

Everybody talking about the trailer.Meanwhile me: Haven&#39;t I heard this bgm somewhere?

&quot;Web of Opportunites&quot;

am i only one who think this trailer is looking like a Dc trailer more than a marvel trailer?.  its Hell black..

bat-man

I&#39;m guessing the end credit scene is him going to come in to the mcu or he&#39;s going to see blade off into the distance

Yes, but what is doctor who doing in the trailer 

Soooooooo… he’s a vampire bat 

Doctor who is in this movie I’m hyped

This how covid happened

The background music

I feel like he should be apart of the xmen

Movie releasing 2 years after the teaser. Wow

Plzz release spider man no way home 2nd trailer

The scene with the spiderman graffiti looks like a toby version of spiderman

From joker to morbius 

Nice

I liked, but please make this in Andrew world ️

Now even more excited

<a href="">2:09</a> sam raimi suit??????? Tff

90&#39;s batman meets modern joker

The Joker is now playing Batman 

did i see matt smith at <a href="">2:12</a>

Waite is over  amazing now movie

Jared Leto is almost 50 btw. Really is a vampire lol

Why?

Watching in 2021 again 

Who noticed a Spiderman picture in background written murderer

watch them reference &quot;bat-man&quot; on this one!

topi ?

<a href="">2:10</a>

11th doctor is hunting morbius

What is this universe where there is a Toby Spider-Man graffiti with the word murder on it and the vulture also a black cat and rhino mention too

<a href="">2:10</a> tobey Maguire

I hate this.

I really hope Morbius and Andrew &#39;s spiderman meet at some point :)

Spiderman with murderer over it is a nice detail

Release the No way home trailer u Ahole

2.11 there is a picture of Spidey Tobey with the word murderer on it

At first I thought this was a doctor who spin off film biased on “ the brain of morbius” episode from the Tom baker era.. no I was wrong

So meaning the Spiderman trilogy will go on

Yo what there&#39;s so much going on

I hope people don’t dislike the trailer big time tomorrow simply because of the fact they want a No Way Home trailer.Fun fact to those people. Endgame’s main trailer didn’t come out till 43 days before release. We are 46 days away right now

DC: Can&#39;t beat the bat.MCU: Become the bats.

Like that movie is so termendous... Must watching this.

<a href="">2:12</a> Doctor who?

Nice

And the award for the most confusing movie trailer goes to…………

Anyone else seriously getting Dracula Untold vibes from this?

Bat man

only just saw this???

Now we can. Believe

Wait a min isn’t that raimi outfit!!

The bgm it reminds me something else

And Doctor Who?

The choice of soundtrack for this movie is frickin op

Jered leto has become a very different actor

Verithanam 
<a href="">2:09</a> LOOK ITS TOBEY MAGUIRE SPIDER-MAN NOT TOM HOLAND!.. This is it guys Multiverse here we go!!

This reminded me of vampires I am happy he is not in my universe

Fucking hell, doctor who go dark.

Why have I never seen this trailer or known that it existed until now

I know no one is gonna see this but just in case they do is this gonna be part of the mcu or not?

Oh look, another movie by Sony that practically requires an R rating to be done right but won&#39;t have it

It looks like a DCEU movie.

So this is a character like batman went horribly wrong ‍️‍️‍️‍️
<a href="">2:10</a> if u see it u see it

lmao get rekt WB for wasting good actors

I wonder if he sent his cast members dead bats to get into charecter

I didnt know there was a first trailer

So Marvel is getting Dark?Thats a good sign

the movie must be cool but I felt sorry for Morbius those stupid kids were bullying him 

ok in this movie, dr.moriarty takes care of joker who is allied with batman

Nothing ever goes doing something with bats... well this statement speaks for itself now...

<a href="">2:10</a> Guys Is that Tobey Spiderman on the wall?

What doesn’t work in DC might work in MCU i guess….

<a href="">2:10</a> is that tobeys Spider-Man

Repeat with me. A TEASER Trailer is not 3 Minutes long. Trailers are 3 Minutes long. This is not a teaser trailer. (Also. Stop putting tine 5s trailers to sell us your trailer. We clicked on the video, didn&#39;t we?)

Kinda glad they kept the hype to a minimum around this, kinda sick of the excessive trailers trend

Finally!!! It&#39;s going to release : )

He in no way home

Why joker in shit marvelSad
<b><i>Morbius Trailer #1: January 13, 2020</i></b><b><i>Morbius Trailer #2: November 2, 2021</i></b>

Fucking no way home trailer release

I got recommend it today

So Dc made batman with no powerMarvel:the real bat man

Was that Fur Alise 

I really forgot about this movie, and it&#39;s out in January... Damn, Sony&#39;s marketing really sucks 

<a href="">2:09</a> A proof that Sony won the spiderman battle, you can see a poster of spiderman on wall and &#39;Murderer&#39; written over it.

y’all will coming back to this trailer when NWH dropped , then y’all will say “It’s all f*<b>**</b> connected”

It’s been confirmed that we’re finally getting a new Morbius trailer tomorrow!!!!!!!!

I want to see Mobius, not Morbius
