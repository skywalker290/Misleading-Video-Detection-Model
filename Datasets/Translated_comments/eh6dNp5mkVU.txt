She’s fat so duh she a introvert fs 

It was so easy to tell it was her before it even started in my opinion

I got it right because she was too obvious

I hate watching his jubilee vids cause he acts like he has all the answers, yet here I am

<a href="">13:01</a> introverts go to party and they cry..they cry every timefelix stop saying such strong truths,it hurts lmao T_T

Me watching for MBTI nerds comments

Introverts are still competitive btw

Being both is called ambivert

i FUCKEN KNEW IT th3 SECOND i saw her

&quot;sometenig to tenk bout&quot;

WAIT I ACTUALLY GOT ONE

They make medicine for anxiety… Xanax 

<a href="">5:23</a> I think Emma or Maya are the extrovert.

Why Gays have Gay Accent ? not being mean like i actually dont get it like do they do it intentionally or what?

I&#39;m an introvert but wtf some of them are kind of weird like, girl talk louder 

they just put a bunch of people with social anxity in a box 

Rewatching this years later, the cricket noise in the start is making me angry lol, Ivlicked the video while I was outside trying to find the INSANELY loud cricket in my backyard and see if my cat would chase it away. I can still hear it, and I had double cricket noise from this video before I noticed the quieter noise was from this.

&quot;go back to speak school!&quot;-felix kegielberg

Ambiversion is a thing. I literally got 51% introversion and 49% extroversion on the Myer Briggs test.

NOOOO! she did so great! wow

Yo she actually nailed that character so well lol

People tend to confuse being an introvert with being socially awkward.

Do they know that not every introvert has social anxiety

I hate when I&#39;m trying to talk and another person interjects. like, can&#39;t you wait until I finish?

<b>chomp</b>

I’m very introverted and got beaten up for it but I hate when people (like my dad) constantly say how unhealthy and bad it is as that made me feel like I was the problem it’s how I am just cuz it’s different doesn’t mean it’s bad and it’s actually works really well for my way of life

Message: don&#39;t stereotype introverts <a href="">16:40</a> : Introverts stereotyping introverts [Ik it&#39;s kinda the games point but FUCKING FUNNY ok]

<a href="">15:30</a> Swedish man with accent: Go back to speaking school...Me: speaking  school? (don&#39;t fuss, i jk... )

Being introvert generally means being in busy places tires you and being alone or with a small group of trusted people gives you rest. Extraverts generally are mentally at ease when in big groups. It has nothing to do with social awkwardness or not, that&#39;s more of side effect.

I feel like this was an obvious one, she was like playing a character and the stuff she said was so textbook

If you are an extrovert you are more likely to be fat .I&#39;ve seen alot of fat people around throughout my life they talk alot more than anyone.  They work, they party, enjoy  and eat most of the unhealthy food outside than they do inside the house.And they&#39;re very good at getting what they want. Ex. Confident and fooling and not getting caught.

Actually Introvert are the great communicator and good at expressing their emotions sometimes

I love how anyone else would never want to speak about that &quot;take on me&quot; performance again but Felix brings it up all the time lol. A true chad.

Me learning I&#39;m definitely an introvert

<a href="">19:04</a> / <a href="">20:09</a>

Every time I see pewdiepie with this hair cut I just think of the “American pewdiepie” meme

I’m definitely an introvert and an American. Felix, you’re not meeting introverts when you come to America, because we’re all inside the house hiding from people 

I thought introvert/extrovert meant how do you gain your energy.. not how do you interact with people?I&#39;m very social, but 100% an introvert.  If I&#39;m out and about non-stop every night/day then I gotta recharge at home.

This is mixing introverted people with shy people. I am loud, I dont really have a problem talking in public, I dont have a problem making conversation. But i cant stand meeting new people without warning, it drains me being out of home for too long, if I go to a party I dont stay further 3 or 4, and I go to parties like once or twice per month because its so tiring

I was wondering why my 2x speed turned into 4x speed all of a sudden

Look at the foreheads, the one who&#39;s sweating is the introvert. 10 seconds and the game is over

personally as an introvert im not really socially awkward for example this might be weird but im totally okay with giving presentations and speeches but social activity is a draining activity for me like i may go silent for some time and need to recharge to be ready to engage and most importantly is the value i give to my lone time like if i have some lone time planned for myself after a long day and someone suddenly invites me to an activity ill be having a hard time to change my plans so spontaneously

I knew it was her mf was acting like an uwu anime girl it was too obvious

You are an introvert Felix, you think you are between being introvert and extrovert because you are charming. This makes you easier to socialize.

I knew from the beginning it was her. Just the way she copied the body language of the others and trying to look extra awkward. It was obvious haha

Introvert = drain energy in sosial interactions / Generate aloneExtrovert = Generate energy in sosial interactions / drain aloneThats it. You can be super outgoing and friendly to people and still be an introvert. It&#39;s all about if sosial interactions are generating or draining you

5 Introverts 1 ExtrovertROUND 1...............Secret Introvert: ...Pewdiepie: Very Interesting

&quot;There&#39;s a saying *cast spell*&quot;

Looking back, its kinda clear how she was the mole. She made sure to always whisper and hold her hands and then of course, the outfit

I thought you were talking about your dog when you said mia :)

i knew it when she said &quot;ahh my girlfriend is also introvert we give each other space we don&#39;t have to talk constantly&quot; FALSE. i am introvert as ffff but i HAVE TO talk with my boyfriend all the time because whenever i feel bad or awkward i have to tell him so he can comfort me. otherwise i would literally die from all of the cringe so sharing makes the situation unimportant. also as an introvert if you choose someone to be your partner, you know you can trust them, most introverts actually talks a lot with the people they love. it is like 100 times more because you don&#39;t have anyone else. you are blasting people you love with lots of random shit so you don&#39;t die

I&#39;m pretty much an ambivert. I sway 3% towards extroversion otherwise am in the middle if that makes sense. There&#39;s a test you can do to figure out where you are on the spectrum. Do the test Pewdiepie and make a video and share your experience Felix I bet many will watch that, and even more so as a collab with Jack or Marzia or something

I&#39;m lil uzi vert

am half introvert cuz i keep asking why school works are annoying

I get the silent round tho I have no idea how to speak to strangers

I knew it was her the whole time  I love it

Crazy concept, try thinking before you speak as well

Apparently all introverts speak like an asmr youtuber? Like bruh

Bro I had to watch alot of ads to write this ( for people that day who&#39;s watching this at 2022 and stuff this it) but you can see how in the silent round alot of people put their arms to themselves? It&#39;s just really relatable toe bruv I do that. I could&#39;ve just said &quot;the way they put their hands in front of them that&#39;s so me &quot; but I wanted to do this much idk why

e

She wore ripped jeans,  the biggest clue was there wtf

Spread the gospel

Spread the gospel

There is a difference between being shy and being an introvert

I find the most introverted women are more extroverted then most introverted men.

<a href="">5:00</a>

Talkative introvert here. Introverts are not boring, not always quiet and actually can perform miracles of communication. There&#39;s just that one catchIt drains one&#39;s soul and after a meeting or even a long text talk I personally wanna hybernate

I recently joined the military, and I&#39;m so confused why that fleece jacket is such a popular fashion trend in the past year or so. From my knowledge, it&#39;s meant to be worn over the uniform, that&#39;s why there&#39;s velcro for your name, country, and rank. I&#39;m not bothered by people wearing it, it&#39;s pretty comfortable. Just curious if it&#39;s more than just a military jacket or if people are wearing it just cause.

they should do the who is not the &quot;pregnant &quot;edition too!

I&#39;m comfortable being quiet in a car, plane IDC I&#39;m not a talker and alot alot of people have told me that ! I think it&#39;s a good thing .

Honestly it&#39;s so easy to fake being an introvert than fake being and extrovert...

This is so werid to watch as introvert, i feel like they tried to outawkward themself. And why is everyone guilt tripping me for liking to be alone.

It’s 100% Maya. No way it’s not.

Tay literaly gave a wikipedia explanation in the first round

Shout out to all of my shy extroverts

Pov: Quiet kids meeting..

This vid mixes up introvert and socially awkward

I GOT IT RIGHT BY THE WAY SHE NODDED

I think these labels don&#39;t mean anything to begin with.

First of all Wtf is an introvert Like just a shy person who keeps to themselves?

Felix: Its so weird how americans just talk to youAlso Felix: Is from Gothenburg, the city known to all Swedes for that exact thing

It&#39;s easy to lie about being an introvert since there are so many misconceptions about them.

Somebody tell pewds he&#39;s ambivert

the way they have just a second of silence after they record individual shots is pissing me off so much.

One thing I noticed is that introverts kind of put on an act and talk in different more high pitched voice when confronted with conversation out in public

Uhm İ m Ambivert Funny

Bro all dude had to do was be black and they thought he wasnt an introvert

Ambivert

Most, if not all, of these people were extroverts. This was dumb.

<a href="">6:50</a> Wtf! If I was among them I&#39;d regret every single second of that bullshit conversation.

being an introvert is different from being socially anxious usually they coincide

The guy just looks gay, he doesnt look like an introvert

potato liar...not good

&quot;introverts can&#39;t be confident&quot; that&#39;s not true Felix hahahaha.

being half introvert and half extrovert means your an ambivert

I still think Alex had a pretty loud combination of gauges and hairstyle.

introverts get energy from self and extroverts get energy from being social and around people. introverts can talk to a load of people and be loud and not mumble and whisper  but then lose their “social battery” quicker than somebody who was extroverted. when that happens they can go off by themselves and “recharge”. introverts aren’t always shy, insecure or socially anxious. anybody can have those traits but it doesn’t make them introverts. it’s just where they get their energy from. so for example, 2020 lockdown was an introverts dream where the person got to choose to talk to people when they wanted to/energised to do so but most of the time they could be by themselves and thrive whereas extroverts felt the most anxious and irritated from the lockdown due to being unable to get their energy from being around people at any time.

Dr. Pewds ova here! &#39;&#39;It&#39;s got nothing to do with introverts&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;I base everything on how Americans behave&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;stop talking to me&#39;&#39;. Get a grip bruh.

i am not extrovert or introvert, i am a human and humans are absolutly bananas my dude

.

For me all of them seems to be extroverts thinking they are introverts.

World: ripped jeansPewds:broken jeans

The easiest way to win this is to kick out the most introverted people

Anxiety isn&#39;t real

Felix: RACIST!!Also Felix:*Constantly shooting for the B girl*

Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving or INTP, that is you Pewds!

Jubilee confirms all introverts are socially awkward, shy, soft spoken loners lol.

Introverts have  4 subtypes  (jin,sugar,jungkook)they are 3 different introverts,jungkook like me is social introvert as dominant subtype(but you can have  other 3 too also at same time,just in lower percentage)Extroverts tooInfp-t 4w5(very strong (second)7 and on four pace by percentage is 6 enneagram)I can communicate with people in park or bus without problem, but when I am at home i am rechargingPewds is social introvert and shy/akward bit

introvert extroverted just a word its not who u are and you will become ok so dont carry this stuffs.

<a href="">12:57</a> yes when we hear the word party we scurry away to the fartherest place from where that word came from.haha but seriously, i’m too awkward for social events. my grandma threw me a birthday party, and i cried in the bathroom the majority of the time

<a href="">0:53</a> the way &quot;one is a liar if they discover who the liar is they get a cash prize&quot; sounds sped up is so creepy but so funny

Nooooooooo I Never would of guessed her as the Mole Noooooooo

I am an ambrivert 

ISTJ - Pewd

Felix: I dont mind silenceAlso Felix: <b>pissed off halfway through the silent round</b>

I communicate a lot with people while being an Introvert. I focus the conversation mostly on them or on something that has nothing to do with me alone like politics or science and I really like giving advice to people and help them out. However I hate when people focus on me, when they ask me questions and stuff. I get very nervous and I tend to smile alot like a psychopath because I get so nervous. I am a confident person but I hate attention and I also need time for myself. I actaully prefer skyping with people instead of meeting them and look face to face, can anyone relate?

I quit being an introvert, life&#39;s so much better now.

sorry did you say GAY CUPS? why did i hear that??i need to get me wax out

According to Carl Jung the definition of the introverted type is one who has an affinity for the subject rather than the object

This vid was bad not pewds but  julibees as a obnoxious introvert myself I feel this is too stereotypical and could be better and the 1st round was literally &quot;silent round&quot; Many Introverts can&#39;t handle silence as it feels too awkward-



Every male in jubilee talk like gay.

Salute to the winner with ENFJ type.They have great chameleon technique!

Jubilee there’s a difference between introvert and nerd.

the first thing i said was that it was her when she said hey i the intro

pewDierPie the reason why everyone is talking  to you is because your fricking pewdiepie

people in the comments: guys introverts aren&#39;t always shy and have social anxiety......while I&#39;m watching this video as an introvert and haven&#39;t talked to someone irl in months and can barely order my own food at a unknown place.

I like public speaking hahha

yyyy

All these introverts in the comment section being triggered and offended 

Called it

he looks like stephen amell i aint even trippin

True introvert don’t define themselves as an introvert.

before I thought I was an introvert, now I realised I am just a very lonely extrovert.

I understand that its a game and all but the moment the fake introvert got away with it kinda hurt me for a sec. it gives me a realization that there are people who fake being an introvert while it takes away the focus from those who actually need the help to overcome their social anxiety.

I&#39;d consider myself both introvert and extrovert

Me:I don&#39;t like anyone Also me :if someone talks to me for a minute I like them

I hate speaking to people

NoooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOIntrovert vs Extrovert doesn&#39;t always mean everything has to do with people! Basically, in MBTI, introversion means you are more in-tuned with how YOU feel or think or how you&#39;ve interacted with certain things. Extroversion is the opposite. They rely on the outward world whether it&#39;s about what people think or feel or whether it&#39;s about how the world looks on the outside and the reality of it instead of how it looks to you personally. Extroversion = Outward World (the physical world), Introversion = Inward World (the mental world)

<a href="">11:09</a> the thing you said about extroverts is literally how my mom is lol

I’m an introvert

I never been to America but I feel like here in Canada has some pretty big conversations

Bunch of introverts in a room together this will be entertaining.....

As an introvert, i hate sharing my own opinion. Because when I do, my opinion is &quot;incorrect&quot;

They took some keyboard warriors for the video

I&#39;m an introvert with ADHD so I&#39;ll be really engaged in a conversation or I&#39;ll be talking a lot and then my social battery will run out mid convo and people get concerned

Introverts don&#39;t like color, or they don&#39;t really care about there outfit.

<a href="">19:28</a>

In the introvert part of the thumbnail, you look like you took the NNN challenge all year long.Edit: amazing vid btw.

Facts for you, introverts aren&#39;t shy but they are people who prefer to be alone/doesn&#39;t want to interact with people but a lot of introverts are not shy, just hate talking to people.

I thought it was Conor Mcgregor

You are intovexetert

As a introvert the recharging alone hits home. I can totally be social with other people and I think I&#39;m good at leveling with people. I also find that I&#39;m usually quiet when I meet new people but once I get comfortable with them I&#39;ll talk and interact like everyone else.

im a iwannadietrovert

<a href="">10:38</a> got me

Fun fact: I&#39;m from Sweden too

I agree with Pewds I’m also like him both introvert and extrovert but a bit more introverted

<a href="">7:44</a> Got me in the introverted feels

Once introverts gets drunk they snap into extroverts or is it just me

I feel like Introverts because they sit inside 90% of the time that try to wear confy clothing, I doubt that introverts would wear very complex clothing with layers and showey colours, I knew from the start that the girl with the dark hair and glasses was sus due to the way she acted and of course her clothes

Being a introvert it besically means the way you interact with the environment and every introvert have a different way of interaction

I suspected her the minute she said she has a dog 

If you pay attention pewds in the thumbnail looks alot like lil hudy

Thinking an introvert can&#39;t have fun at a party is plain stupid... As an introvert, I like concerts and parties too, like with friends.

Bruh the silent round lmaooooo

I knew it was her when i saw her smile in the begining

I KNEW IT!

meme review with Elon musk for extrovert pewds

These arnt introverts they&#39;re socially inept

Am i a introvert  if im watching this video to make sure I&#39;m an introvert

Introverts are selective not shy.

the way they talked was so annoyinglike tryna seem more quiet than they probably are

Wow, what a good liar lmao.

im really quiet and often get typed as an introvert by others but i get my energy from being around people so i consider myself to be an extrovert (im also an enfj like the girl that won actually )

Beard go brrrrr……

they say “like” SO MUCH I CANT STOP NOTICING IT EVERY TIME

pain

If you&#39;re not an introvert or extrovert then there&#39;s a chance that you&#39;re Liluzivert.

How do you not know it&#39;s  acricket? Bruh! lul

Bro the tiktok girl is so fcking annoying

That extroverted chick sounded like she was forcing herself to speak softly, also in my experience once you get really comfortable with someone you dont need time away from them because it doesnt exhaust you to speak to them anymore.

Introvert: Gets energy from having alone timeExtrovert: Gets energy from being around peopleThat&#39;s literally it. Both these groups are very broad and can fit many different personalities. It doesn&#39;t mean that all introverts are socially awkward or depressed and not all extroverts are clingy and annoyingly loud

So if you prefer texting you are introverted

if everyone is silent, i would have laughed for sure and I think

yer a wizard harry (pewds)

Tf is owls in the moss 

I don’t think emma is introverted. She seems more like a shy extrovert with social anxiety

not 1 of them is an introvert lol. they all just act shy and broken inside like that has to do with anything. most people can&#39;t even tell if they&#39;re one or the other and have to take a test to figure it out for sure. these guys just acted out some emo vibe and it&#39;s getting real introverts mad about it.

YouTube : wanna find out whether pewds&#39; an introverted or extroverted 1 year later?Me : yes

I think people get introversion mixed up with other things. There are introverts who are charming, talkative, and can get on a stage and do public speaking. It’s not about “awkwardness” it’s about where you feel comfortable. An introvert is someone who would prefer to spend time by themself as that is where they feel most energized and motivated. Important to note there’s a difference between introversion and social anxiety as well

I think im an introvert because i can &quot;summon&quot; the burst energy to be friendly, talkative, etc, but after a few hours it is so exhausting and i just wanna cramp up in my room alone

Stupids for sure the extrovert one will try na act like an introvert so they won&#39;t open up much.

Among us live action

“maybe i’m just european” ahahahhaha bro

Conclusion- the girl was soo good at lying and introverts can talk normally in most of the case.

People either act like introverts are some sort of royalty and everyone oughta be one because EW, EXTROVERTS ARE ALL . . . LOUD AND . . . CLICHE AND COMMON, UGH or they act like introversion is a disease to be avoided at all costs like come on you guys lmao.

being an introvert means you gain energy whilst being alone and being surrounded by people basically drains there social  battery but extroverts are the opposites they get energy when being near people and lose energy when alone which usually leaves them restless  it has just about nothing to do with mental illnesses confidence and liking or disliking people and ambiverts are a mix of the 2 they basically have an on off switch and its hard keeping track. I myself am an ambivert and my own &quot;social battery&quot; can drain and fill at random times and its a blessing and a curse I&#39;ve grown to enjoy time to be alone and go off in my own world and enjoy being surrounded by friends i enjoy public speaking too but im not super confident either and that has nothing to do with being an extra/intro/ambivert

I think I&#39;m extrovert because I can talk guys.️

I&#39;m a fake extrovert

Things are more awkwaarrdd when you force a conversation. PREAAACCHH

now i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m an introvert. what&#39;s it called when you realize how self absorbed and overall ignorant you are, and how hard it is to stop your mouth when it starts, so you learn to stay quiet unless you&#39;ve got something useful to say?

They vote the black guy out and then decide to talk... lol wow, incredible

INTROVERTS DONT LAUGHT FAKE VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is this about introverts or socially anxious people?

<a href="">19:25</a>Just from the fact that you refuse to take photos with fans, you&#39;re probably leaning towards introversion.

They completely ignored ambiverts though.I am in majority an introvert but based on all personality tests that I took I am between 53%- at most 60% introvert. So I am pretty much the definition of ambivert.

<a href="">9:33</a>They&#39;re lying. It&#39;s so painfully obvious.

my friends don&#39;t know they are talking to the fake me....

We also now have the G-fuel gay cups lol 

Plot twist: They&#39;re all extroverts whe were used for the video, cuz they couldn&#39;t find an introvert

Alex was so clear I mean he is gay so 100%clear

why are they all whispering? introverts aren&#39;t boring, we just need some time to ourselves after interacting with others. that&#39;s it

extrovert also can have social anxiety where at some point u wanna do stuff alone and not being bothered by anyone and anything

As an introvert, I hate how they made us seem. We can still talk normally and be happy and bubbly

What did we just learned? extroverts are really good liars

<a href="">6:03</a> James Charles, that you

They&#39;re all either fake introverts. It can clearly be seen.

I pride myself in being a confident introvert

WOW IM as Annoyed as Pewdiepie WTF lol she manipulated her own personality

ah The first girl might me sus now

before the first vote imma go with the first girl on the left and the last girl on the leftEdit: Pewdiepie chose the same thing lol.

All the people at the beginning doing eye contact with everyone when all I would do in this situation is look at the floor or play with my bracelet

U can tell that their introvers speaking so qiutly it&#39;s embarrasing to watch 

I would say I&#39;m an extrovert, but at the same time I have like a ton of social anxiety.

She is not an extrovert lol she definitely wants people to see her as an extrovert...

Ah, all these stereotypes about both introverts and extroverts are just killing me... And that&#39;s why I&#39;m happy the extrovert won. I thought the main difference between both was where you get your energy from - for extroverts being around other people and for introverts, recharging best on their own. Why do we have to keep perpetuating the belief that all extroverts WON&#39;T ever shut up and all introverts are anxious, hard-to-talk to people who never enjoy themselves in a group? I consider myself a pure form of an extrovert most of the time - I like being around people, I get energised when I&#39;m around people and I like talking to strangers, BUT I also hate public speaking, have had social anxiety and I can definitely shut up and listen when I need to.

Um introverts can talk and have conversation they just don’t always like to hangout all the time and they do like to go out for fresh air and can have friends they just get there energy from being along for a while and being at home doing things by themselves to relax from interacting with people so much  cause I’m an introvert

When pewdipie said, &quot; introverts don&#39;t deserve money &quot;Introverts: 

the way most of them have their hands in the beginning

she really lied to us like that wth hahahahaha I swear she was so shy wow im shocked

Pewdiepie should take the 16 Personalities test. I&#39;m so curious to see his result. 

Emma was my babysitter

Being introvert , don&#39;t social awkward Everytime . Life hit hard job work blah blah have to put face

you are correct lol

You should watch the 4 types of introverts.

I&#39;m a intp

This is honestly so stupidEvery person is unique and different. I don&#39;t like categorising people into two groups. It&#39;s too general. I believe that mentally healthy, balanced people need both communication and alone time on a balanced level. It&#39;s just that each person has these two, in different levels. Being alone too much, with no communication or ,on the other hand, being out all the time without spending time for yourself, like reading books or learning are both equally not good for you. But let&#39;s never forget that everyone has different needs and their phycology differs as well. Some people just feel safe and alright being alone, some suffocate even in the thought. Some are shy but really like communication, some are more bold but like to spend some time alone. Categorising them to introverts and extroverts is not even realistic. It&#39;s simply idiotic

<a href="">15:35</a>xanny take the anxiety away

Bro when my friends call me i get an anxiety attack immediately- texting is wayy better

As soon as she said she likes tik tok.  What kind of introvert watches tik tok?

Wow, I feel tricked, decieved, betrayed. Loki, is that you?

Pewds u have the idea of a introvert 100% big 

I&#39;m a introvert and I like walks in the forrest alone or with good friends that are quiet while walking. So I do love going outside I think more introvertz have this.

I think these are just people that put themselves in a box

I&#39;m an introvert.. maybe i&#39;m just european.Pewds.

I disagree with the introverts can&#39;t be confident part, i am so introverted and and i meet all the criteria for introverts, but when i have to deal with others or generally in my life i am so confident, i don&#39;t think that those to things are related at all.

Fun fact: most of the people watching this video thinks that they are an introvert

U guys are misunderstanding what introvert means. Introverts are not depressed, social anxiety, etc (like negative stuffs about it). Introverts are actually very friendly, talkative or not and has a lot of friends. What makes it introvert because introverts like to spend their time alone and where they get energy from, like doing solo activities such as drawing, painting, playing music/instruments, etc. Unlike extroverts, they get their energy by spending time with their friends or peers

I feel like I’m both int and ext well because if I was speaking publicly about something I didn’t want to speak about I would be more shy than if I were to speak publicly about something I was passionate about.

This is more about shyness and confidence rather than introvert/extrovert

Well i am introvert but i swear like hell and not speak so softly like they do

I think a lot of people mix up introversion with just being shy. The difference is that the former doesn&#39;t enjoy talking to people, the latter is scared of talking to people. There&#39;s a difference. You can be extroverted and shy at the same time.

I&#39;m an anxious-avoidant type of introvert and I used to have friends that were outgoing and the more convenient type of introverts... they left me. I&#39;m stuck in this phase for a long time now actually and being like this sucks.

Stereotype: depression, anxiety, shy, meanWhy though?

I’m not an introvert. I just don’t like people.

my friend from USA told me that he likes Estonians because its normal to sit with them in the same room without saying anything

ENFP-T

Hinthrowert

i knew it from the start

y’all plz stop whining in the comments it makes us look bad

What&#39;s an introvert I ama sigma male

This is so awkward and cringe

I’m an enxrovert (introvert and an extrovert mixed together)

I knew the Mole was still in the box...but I guessed the wrong mole...

im an ambivert (both). I also realized I commented on this video a year ago so that&#39;s cool

Me <b>Watching at 2x speed</b>Felix <b>Watching at 2x speed</b>Me <b>WATCHING AT 4X SPEED</b>

I have no idea whether im introverted or extroverted at this point. All i know is i do all the things that extroverts do and come back exhausted and again going tomorrow and sometimes having fun too. When im with my friends i can be really loud too. But i feel so relieved when i have time to myself. I dunno.

It is SOOO obvious that I am an introvert. I am usually the one that kinda just sits there and doesn’t say anything, it my be my extreme social anxiety but idk

I&#39;m a pervert

<a href="">9:24</a> that&#39;s where i thought she doesn&#39;t even know what they are talking about she just responded fast.

Pewdipie: Americans are all extroverts and hangout and talk a lotMe, an American watching this at 1:32am: Agreed

We recorded a 6 Extroverts vs 1 Introvert video today. Looking forward to seeing you&#39;re reaction to it.

Before watching the video, Imma say, Emma looks wayyy to comfortable with other people.

The person above me is not human.

This make brain hurt

Watching this and seeing other people have the same problems as me actually made me feel a lot better for some reason

i am an introvert

GFule gay cups yo thats epic. <a href="">19:29</a>

Just from the silent round I would say that the woman in the middle would be the extravert. Most of them have their hand in front of them while they hold their hands. I believe this may be a subtle self soother due to the &quot;stress&quot; of the scenario. the man on the right with his hands behind his back may catch your attention, however his shoulders are sort of arching in and his back is slouched, as if he is sort of retreating into himself. The woman in the middle looks confident, Back straight, and solid eye contact throughout most of the round. Granted most of this is stereotyping and generalized observations of body language.

I spat out my drink when he said he’s Swedish saying I deadset thought it was a joke and they weren’t even real words

Not all introverts have social anxiety. But I sure do.

Do some introverts can keep a conversation for a minute or two then any more than that is just awkward?

I remember the best example given to me about the difference between an introvert and extrovert was this:An introvert and an extrovert are like batteries.Introverts charge when they are alone or in their own environment doing their own thing while extroverts charge when they are around other people. The longer introverts go out in public and in social settings, the more their battery drains. The longer extroverts are away from other people and are alone, the same result happens. They both become emotionally and mentally exhausted the more they are around or away from others.

Im a ambivert so im both.:)

pewdiepie is something called an extrovert

Gay cup!?

the thing about europeans is so true lmao

To be honest I was a lot more introverted before Covid than I am now. But I do kinda hang between the two.

being introvert doesn&#39;t mean i can&#39;t talk to any new people i meet... but i just need a time for me to blend other people.

This is honestly so painful, because it literally just means if you relax more in solitude VS than with other people. That doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t prefer being around more people, but that you chill more in your alone time.

Why do I feel like they&#39;re all whispering?

It low key made me so mad when Alex talked about how he was going to spot the extrovert by looking for people with confidence. Not all introverts are insecure and anxious ‍️ If they wanted to talk about confidence, Jubilee should make a spot the socially anxious person not spot the introvert. They aren’t synonymous Love ur vids, Felix

Me an introvert would be voted out before the game even began, . When random people talks to me, I just bow my head, or smile, and slightly wave, depending on what’s going on.

I KNEW IT!!!! DAMN IT IM GOOD in the 3rd round i knew it was her cuz the real intro were talking and mumbling a lil bit but she didnt mumble at all or feel stressed like the others and thats cuz she int  he ENFJ  hahahha u cant hide ur true colors

<a href="">9:38</a> why does that saying just sound like someone choking on their drink

As an introvert I knew it was her when she  stoped looking at the other girl she didn’t look away 

<a href="">12:16</a> lmao pewds. he gon blow

<a href="">2:15</a> omg same

I&#39;m extremely introvert and even i found the silent round suffocating. That&#39;s so claustrophobic.

“What the hell is happening? He’s  turning red!” Me: <b>intense giggling</b>

I think everyone in this contest portrayed themselves more introverted than they actually were just so that they don&#39;t look sus.

Inroverts Deserve Poor

Man he looks like jacksepticeye in this one...

First of all of they all are introvert then they would not be really here having a social interaction

Me, an ambivert:

I’m an INTP ️️️

Out going introverts are a thing. What makes you an introvert is what drains your energy and what gives you energy.

the fact she talks 1.5x faster than me, is INSANEE!  -_-

I knew it XD

I knew it was her. Ugh the entire time she was just portraying what an introvert is. I like having my space and sometimes hate social gatherings if it&#39;s not close friends or family. Though when I do meet my friends, we can be chatty and stuff but I like recharging and spending a day off alone watching youtube and chilling and not being bothered by roommates or family.

There is also ambivert or omnivert.

I thought I was introverted until I watched this video… they all act like “omg I’m an introvert <b>shhhh </b> <b>giggling quietly</b> omg don’t look at me” .

I already know im an introvert

Jim Carrey&#39;s face mixed with Pewds is in the image

<a href="">15:50</a> hearing Felix’s breathing patterns 

she was so obviously the mole

he needs to watch Eric Wen’s personality analyst reacts to pewdiepie where he guesses at pewd’s mbti personality type!!

<a href="">12:15</a> was so funny with the lights slowly turning red as he was having a breakdown

Being an introvert doesn’t mean that your depressed awkward and just want to stay at home introverts just mean needing your space but still like to talk to people and sometimes going out and there is nothing wrong with that just like the saying there is no place like home so we all like being home it’s not an introvert thing

Women are introverts and men are extroverts

Torn jeans says it all

She gave up her cover pretty fast

Ambivert is the word you’re looking for there pewds  it is a thing.

They vote Antoine outPewds: Racist!Black girl opens her mouthPewds: DON&#39;T TRUST YOU!!

That hair XD

&quot;maybe I&#39;m just European&quot; ahahahahahaaha

I can relate to this guy, I’m also kind of a mix of introvert and extrovert, I can get energy by being alone and do my stuff, but also from people, mainly with the ones who I know like friend a and family. It can even be from a person in internet, though I can’t trust them 100%, I usually give people the opportunity to get to know me if I want to

Jung (1923) described extroverts as preferring to engage with the outside world of objects, sensory perception, and action. Introverts he described as being more focused on the internal world of reflection, are thoughtful and insightful

I&#39;m an Inxtrovert, depends on the situation

Many people dont know this but introverts are humans too believe it or not

&quot;I&#39;m extroverted&quot;

i would like to comment.. uploading.. haha!! there it is!! Deal With It!!

my guess is maya

Introvert+Extrovert= Ambivert, you are welcome :)

People really don&#39;t understand what an introvert is. Extroverts who call themselves introverts because they get &#39;shy&#39; sometimes are the worst kinds of people.

every time felix talks about americans being extroverted, i just cringe. not because its wrong, but because i hate how truthful it is. I struggle with anxiety and ive gone from being more of an ambivert to an extreme introvert. Its really difficult to be around people because of the GAD, but just not having the social battery or comfortability to even attempt to speak to others or do something socializing is just really tiring lol, so it made me get like goose bumps every time he talked about it. In essence; i don&#39;t like americans :D

I read somewhere that extroverts are more (don&#39;t get me wrong) adventurous and that led to more extroverts than introverts emigrated to america during the 1800s and that why extrovert genes has spread more in america than in europe

Imagine someone rips a loud one during the silent round.

Pewds: “I’m think I’m both introvert and extrovert”Pewds 5 minutes later: “Maybe I’m just European”This guy just labeled a whole continent as introverted 

Pewds was so scared when he was turning red

The thing is with me is that when someone sees me hanging out with my friends they think I&#39;m an extrovert but like I have to see those people nearly every day of my like 7+ hours a day, so I don&#39;t seem introverted around them. But in all honesty I am extremely introverted. I also just have really bad hereditary social anxiety that I got from my dad. this year for my family&#39;s mother&#39;s day party my dad had to take me home because I had a full on panic attack in the middle of the party. typically I just have everyone leave me the hell alone at like parties and stuff but I couldn&#39;t for that.

Jesus is king

They&#39;re all extroverts the real introverts are in there homes chillin peacefully

I swear this makes us extroverts look desperate for attention/clingy lmao

Introverts become extroverts when their comfortable

i&#39;m confused , <a href="">0:35</a> is this felix ?

my best introvert argument: being really good friend with people online for many years, but meeting them irl... that&#39;s another story.

So it&#39;s funny how the mole is an ENFJ, and the ones that are left are INFP and INFJ. infp&#39;s shadow type is enfj which made it harder for the introvert to see through the lies lmao. And then INFJ chick was so busy trying to emulate her own shadow type which is ENFP for constantly being the initiator in the group to see the lies. It is true that INFJ is the most extroverted introverts out there though. That&#39;s why they tend to call themselves ambiverts.

<a href="">7:24</a> &quot;Let&#39;s get real here.&quot; the classic PewDiePie line.

<a href="">10:15</a> who tells you that

&quot;You&#39;re a stinky sl-&quot; Felix: If I finish this sentence I will be canceled again... Felix after:  Nice save!

&quot;I need my space&quot; <b>AGGRESSIVELY BANGS ON TABLE</b>

This episode is honestly boring, and confusing. Pewds made it better

I am an introvert combined with extrovert. With small talks I preffer texting but if we&#39;ll talk for longer time I preffer calling cus I am lazy

pewdiepie : &quot;negliiguable&quot; &quot;nejiglabele&quot; &quot;nejijable&quot;also pewdiepie : &quot;Axiety&quot;??? learn how to speak Maya! Go back to speaking school!

Who else is an extrovert

As a Finn, Swedes are extremely outgoing and extroverted. To us, they might as well be Americans.

I&#39;m neither introverted or extroverted, I&#39;m retarded.

&quot;Der er ugler i mosen&quot; is the Danish equivalent of the swedish saying &quot;Jag aner ugler i mosen&quot;, and I did too at that point! :D

I already know im an introvert i would rather be at home than in public im socially awkward i get anxiety big time being around people i dont know i dont like when people come over to my house like family like they arent doing anything tney arent bothering me but just them being around i just want them to go away im basically the definition of a loner

lowkey want to see pewds take an mbti  test XD

bruh if I were been there I would ask them to vote out the extrovert right away I can see by the appearance she looks like a valley girl who is prob not an introvert but she also looks like the girl who would go on a vegan rally which is not and introvert thing so its pretty obvious

I am the same as felix, when starting a conversation with an new person it’s like:HiHiHow are you Good. You?Good.But midway through with this person I just can’t stop talking. I don’t make friends easily cuz I either talk to much or talk to little

yo wasn&#39;t Antoine on the anime fan video

Pewds seems like total introvert to me.  Just look at his career alone in a room.

felix is the most relatable person in this vedio

Pewdiepie O.P.

Silent round I really thought the extrovert would just jump out yelling “ITS ME, I CANT BE SILENT ANY LONGER”

Very much agreed, people don’t know to enjoy silence and don’t know how to shut the fuck up

Among us meetings be like:

I actually enjoyed a 1st reaction video that has pauses in between for opinions

Im an Extravert

Sometimes I feel like being an introvert is wrong. People tell me &quot; Talk more &quot;. I cannot talk more or less. &quot; I&#39;m  not like you&quot; I want to tell them. I&#39;m human too. I can talk. Its not like I&#39;m mute. I have one friend and she tells me I&#39;m an awesome person. She is an extrovert. I don&#39;t have to tell you that I can talk I&#39;ll talk when I&#39;m comfortable !

Who else noticed the army cold weather jacket on pewds??

I haven&#39;t finished the video yet I am currently at <a href="">15:32</a> But I have noticed that Maya keeps asking the questions, so that would seem more social to me, whereas the other people are answering questions, and she is saying the stereotypical traits of an introvert, but also the one on the very left, always starts off with the questions, just what I have found at this point in time.

He is a ixtrovert or entrovert

THE INTROVERTS DESERVED IT LMAO

Unfortunately I&#39;m an introvert

I think they are all bullshitting   They just  base all there facts about introverts off stereotypes

Maybe they talk to you because your famous just a random guess tho

as an introvert, I&#39;d say anyone who laughs/smiles while speaking is an introvert!

There is a big ass difference between a introvert and a mute

peng

Don&#39;t worry PewDiePie, you&#39;re an INFJ. I gotchu.

Alright be honest who else checked to see if they were watching in 2x playback speed

as an introvert we don&#39;t claim them they not valid

I literally knew the second the fake introvert spoke

this shows how easly extroverts  can lie and controll or use us--

Anyone else heard Felix breathing 

Can&#39;t believe this video is 1 YEAR OLD

I definitely feel like us Europeans are more introverted than other people lol

omfg that girl should be an actress deadass

I’m I’m an introvert. I’m confident in myself but I don’t interact unnecessarily with others as it’s draining and I’d just rather not. I just want to be cosy and get on with it, I do things at my own pace and in my own style. I can occasionally fake being an extrovert if it’s needed, e.g. job interviews but I have to mentally prepare and make sure I’m well rested and everything is right for the event lol.I like certain people but I sort of go through a mental vetting process at first to assess whether I can let them in. If I trust them then I can relax and it is not a draining experience. Quality over quantity. Then that person can also have a quality friend in me too.Also I’d never go in about my mental health etc to other people that’s between me and myself if there is ever an issue.

I’m a advocate with introvert so I can see right thru these people

<a href="">13:38</a> &quot;I have a girlfriend&quot; LOL 

Pewds is loosing his Swedish skills :(

Wow I picked it in the first round... it&#39;s amazing what you can pick up from body language. Not from the extrovert&#39;s body language but the introverts&#39; !!!

I knew it was that tiktok girl because she said she was confident she also speak a lot

1 extrovert in a tank full of introverts and guess who get&#39;s the money

I am Indian

Joe nuts

I don&#39;t know how people go to bed without any noise I can&#39;t physically do that I have to have noise in background otherwise I freak out

when people confuse social anxiety for introverts:

Pewds is an ambivert.

Top 10 anime plot-twists

I’m fifty introvert fifty extravert I took a test lol

Pewdiepie: &quot;Why is everyone talking to me&quot;Me: IDK maybe it because your one of the biggest youtubers on the planet.

Jubilee: silent round Pewdiepie: what are they saying

ambivert - is the name of it

I never loved my name more He gave Maya so much shit and I am all here for it ... soo many alarms I can make my favorite is No Maya ... you lier ... you stinky lier ... potato lier I might tattoo it on me 

so your an ambivert i believe its called when at times you are introverted but in other situations you can be extroverted

Me as an introvert would be so scared to do this video We are not comfortable with people around.

As someone who is a little more introverted this is the most stereotyped sh!t ever.

Feel ya felix xD as a fellow European. You just don&#39;t do the talking stuff here with strangers

Just because you&#39;re introverted doesn&#39;t mean you speak in ASMR

I&#39;m an introvert but once in year I a can see myself on the bar holding a drink having a party.........but a lot of time I just  watch anime day.

The most quit and polite crowd ever on jubilee. The crew had a nice chill workday that day.

<a href="">0:36</a> HAHAHAHAHA

can we just stop and appreciate the sound coming from his nose?

People seem to consider depressed person and introvert person the same.

as more introvet i agrre with everythinking

<b>silent round</b>Is me not even making an eye contact to anybody of them

I think a real introvert would not amswer cause hes too nervous

<a href="">0:19</a> he is an ambivert. This is why Pewdiepie is NOT ISTJ. He has high Ne. I thought he was an INTP or ENTP but now that he claims ambiversion I deem him an ENTP.  INTPs are introverted af  also watching a video on 2x speed is sooooo ENTP.

Me thinking people wouldn’t be able to tell I’m an introvertAlso me: wearing a hoodie that says “Leave me alone”

<a href="">7:52</a> “feeling over looked” as they skipped over one girl ... (unless it was cut out)

well not gona lie that was a shocking

&quot;They sure are&quot;

LubaTv looks different...

with quarantine i’ve become an introverted extrovert yk

I think that it&#39;s one introvert and 6 secret extroverts

being both an introvert and extrovert is known as an ambivert (true fact)

okay bc im an introvert and even if i was nervous i would not be whispering like that LMAO i would just be louder and a lil more awkward

<b>Lets Whisper Because Introverted Means Quiet</b>

Not to be rude but I think they didn’t question if she’s an extrovert because she was overweight and I think it’s another stereotype, but well done to her she did good

I knew it was the girl in the cardigan the second she said “me bf is an introvert too and we give each other space” bro introverts become crackhead extroverts around the people they’re really comfortable with

I think I am both but more introverted than extroverted. I’m very quiet in school and when ever someone random asks me something or whatever they always tell that I have a Deep voice. Btw I’m in Year 7

its a cricket

&quot;You&#39;re a stinky sl-&quot;<a href="">17:13</a> Whatcha sayin?

I&#39;m an introvert. If I were there I would just be awkward and stare at the ground. and be more comfortable with that than looking at people or saying anything.

that&#39;s why I can&#39;t understand the intro at <a href="">1:05</a> because I&#39;m watching on x2 speed while Pewds is watching on x2 speed so for me it&#39;s on x4 speed

As an introvert, I&#39;m not socially awkward. I just prefer to be alone at home rather than in public. Btw, combination of introvert and extrovert = ambivert

I feel like i should move to Europe o dont want to talk to people i dont want to talkwe just met we dont need to have a converstationUnless i know that person then its fine

I agree with pewds

just  made a word if you are an extrovert and an introvert you are and introextrovert so that is pewdiepie

pewds why are you wearing an army fleece jacket and why is it out of regs

I got an introvert/extravert quiz ad in the middle of this

I can also see Alex having fun at parties... if 4 or 5 close friends. He reminds me of some ambivert people I know.

Introversion and extroversion is based on how you put your energy in an environment. Is it external or internal

That&#39;s the people with anime pictures in the comments

Why’s he so harsh on maya

<a href="">5:39</a> kinda racist felix

I think the name for someone who is both is an ambivert, I&#39;m not sure

Grasshopper sound is my life&#39;s soundtrack

I think everyone is an introvert until they open up

It was super easy to see it was her, she was just throwing out stereotypes about introverts with no substance.

I&#39;m just awkward. With and without people.

The tall guy easyly extroverted I voted him also the black woman is wearing a wig because it&#39;s just sitting there.

Introverted knight

I want to be both

I love public speaking :D

fun fact: introverts can talk, and can speak without mumbling.

It&#39;s weird how im an introvert but wants to be an Extrovert, im just too awkward and have a bad personality so I just stick with it...

outcome: pervert

From now on I&#39;m gonna call ripped jeans broken jeans



This jubilee video is annoying because it’s such a stereotypical idea of introverts

&quot;i don&#39;t trust the girl with the dirty jeans--broken jeans&quot;

Cheese

Yes it&#39;s more awkward when someone tries to force a conversation instead of being silent

I am an introvert, but I am also sometimes the life of the party, because when I&#39;m stressed, I become a  f u n n y   g u y.

I kinda of like socializing but after like 2hrs am usually soo frickin&#39; tired and i shut down...I need my alone time please

I&#39;m an introvert and, Emma was talking so loud and so much and moved a lot. In my opinion she was the mole I haven&#39;t watched it whole yet

Pewds your not introvert or extrovert, your are just Swedish

Idk what i m i hate people but i Think im an extrovert

im an ambivert (both introvert and extravert)

Who would agree to being part of this? I just.... ugh.

Introverts are comfortable here because everyone knows that all are introvert

Nerds is different from introvert.  Just differentiate that.

I just got an add for a quiz to see if your an introvert or extrovert

I think its Emma, I’m <a href="">6:15</a> into the vid. Edit: <a href="">17:12</a>  What- i thought it was Emma because of her hand movements when she was talking... guess i was wrong.

They are so many different types of people in American.

Why does this feel like among us?????

im an extrovert and im honestly ragiiNnnGGgng by the fact some people think just because your introverted you cant have fun like what the fuck

Being an ambivert is also a thing that I learnt not long ago.

usually the strat is to talk a lot so ppl don&#39;t think ur sus, but not in this one.

I feel like being more quiet is awkward because you could talking about a subject you both like or joke but your just being quite

I&#39;m Human.

Had to fish out a single gay guy to fill that political void. But there’s no Asian so they’re racist in the end. Mission Failed

i love public speaking tho?

amungus irl!!!

I knew it she looks like she just dressed the part and it worked on them lol

I KNEW IT WAS HER WITH HER LITTLE KNIT SWEATER AND PLAYING WITH HER HANDS, WHAT IS THIS SNOW WHITE. THESE PEOPLE ARE DUMB

Introvert = charging energy aloneExtrovert = generating energy in extroversion

I knew instantly who was extroverted just cause of the way she dresses, and I have known a lot of girls who look like her who are extroverted

im a extrovert i belive :)

Introverts are extroverts in front of introverts

them saying: like... like... like... like... like... is annoying

<a href="">10:15</a>Dont flatter yourself kid, you are the least intimidating person I have ever seen

why tf they say &quot;like&quot; every 3 words

GAY CUPS

Introverted just means you get your energy back from having some time alone, you don’t have to be depressed  you can be as loud as anything or be the life of a party but just not always for very long.

Pewds: the grass hopper soundsCrickets: am I joke to you?

So I realised I&#39;m not an introvert, I&#39;m an ultra shytrovert awkward guy.

<a href="">6:36</a>

your a Ambivert

Create content ? no hitchhike on other people&#39;s content ... who rented studios and made a lot offort ....

Percocets Mollies Percocets

People don’t trust me that I’m an introvert. I can’t talk with new people, but when I am asked - it’s like a chain - I simply can’t shut up. That’s why I hate talking in general.

introvert does not equal shy or reclusive... Im an introvert but am outgoing with strangers and friends and love going out at least once a week

I thought I was an introvert but seeing this makes me feel like I’m extrovert as fuck

Introvert you need time alone, extrovert you need time with people. That simple really. Not about awkwardness or anything else. As either you can still enjoy time with people or alone, just is which you need more.

PewDiePie

why does felix always watch videos at 2x

I feel you Felix, I live in America and am comfortable with silence and most people here are not. It has to be constant conversation or it’s “awkward” but I find disingenuine conversation to be the most awkward and would rather just be at peace in silence

Imma be honest, as an introvert, I wouldn&#39;t need space around my girlfriend, I&#39;d want to be with her more, I&#39;d need to be around her XD

people think that enjoying your &quot;alone time&quot; means your an introverts, idk about you but I&#39;m pretty sure everyone enjoys being alone once in a while and listen to music in a quiet room. annoying introverts always over exaggerate on how they LOVE being alone and then complain about how their so lonely cause they don&#39;t have any irl friends while actively avoid irl people, while belittling people who enjoys being around other people. stop it, get some help

Im like in the 1% of introverted People Who prefer calling

<b>there is one extrovert among us</b>

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m europian&quot; SAYS GUY WHO BORN IN SWEDISH

checkmate! she isn&#39;t even lesbian.

<a href="">6:06</a> damn, that man is so gay lol

<a href="">13:32</a> This is just a typical girl talk and has nothing to do with being introvert and extrovert. I would know because I pretended to be gay and got into the slumber party.

I am introvert but I’m not that akward lol

They are just here for money nothing else

Fuck silence I need the hussle and hussle of the city at all times right outside my door

Me personally, 50 intro. 50 extro. I enjoy time to myself for extended periods of time and the same for when I&#39;m with friends. I love being alone and having fun with my creativity and I have a lot of confidence and self-esteem.

that&#39;s exactly the one with glasses. She is the one that &#39;dressed like introvert&#39; fushdhrje

Feels like I&#39;m watching among us ......

Extroverts are talking to actual people as we Introverts keep arguing in these comments about the difference between introvert and shy...

i knew the lesbian was the mole, i knew it

the ones who have their hands behind their back on the first round are my guesses

Looks like Pewds camera in this video was sponsored by Jubilee. good quaility

AHHH WTH He&#39;s turning REDDD hahhaha

that girl is the greatest deceiver of all time

I&#39;m a gamer, I play minecraft

Some people don&#39;t realize that introverts can be really good at talking with other people and sometimes even the loudest and most charismatic (this is not to confuse being loud with charismatic however). While it is more common to find extroverts in this category it is still entirely possible, and pretty frequent, that introverts fit these roles.

AMOGUS REFRENCE!!!!!!

I don’t understand why an introvert would participate in this. I call fake. They are all fake.Edit, they are clearly operating from different definitions of introvert.

fact for no reason : a person who is both an introvert and an extrovert is called ambovert

Nah the mole gave herself away round 1. All of her responses sound way too spot on and she looks like she’s trying to a c t introverted

Move out of the way all introverts ad extroverts....<b>who here is an ambivert?</b>

if i had a dollar for every time someone said “like” i would have more than the winner

There is extrovert among us

Im an introvert, I sleep by myself

<a href="">16:00</a> American teens and young adults in general never shut up about anxiety. For some reason, &#39;anxiety&#39; makes it sound more dramatic than it is. It&#39;s like &quot;just say you were nervous&quot;. &quot;Just say you get OCD, not [squeeky girl voice] &#39;i hev acsiety&#39;.&#39;&quot; 

<a href="">1:55</a> Holy crap I thought that was normal, but it&#39;s just Americans?So we introverts in America would fit in with the rest of the world.

Are they aware of ambiverts

I like how they use the word &quot;like&quot; like over one million times like, and even puwds like started to say &quot;like&quot; like so many times.

&quot;We also now have the Gfuel gay cups.&quot;- PewDiePie, 2020

Watching the part in 2x speed in 2x speed tho

pewds: learn to speak mayaalso pewds: nejlijgablej

plot twist: he&#39;s neither. he&#39;s  PERvert

tf why are they whispering???????????

imagine being an introvert and saying that you are an introvert. yep, true introverted traits

I&#39;m extrovert but shy you know

Me are cringe

felix immediately saying &quot;i don&#39;t trust you&quot; when the black woman appeared is such a mood

you can be a social introvert, youll just get tired and drained very fast

<a href="">3:54</a> grasshopper sounds?

Are you really an introvert if you appeared on a YouTube video where millions of people can see it? 

there is one extrovert amogus

I&#39;m a INTJ-A / INTJ-T wby guys?

The curvy alley longitudinally cross because butane unexplainably pass round a accurate instrument. crabby, unwritten nylon

Nah, Antoine was just acting weird as hell. Starring at everyone

Introverts:we don&#39;t socialize.we don&#39;t STARE.

We all on the spectrum

Just because you are extrovert doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t lack in confidence and the other way around. Introverts can be confident, they just have to work hard for it.

( I know I&#39;m late) I&#39;m sorry i have social anxiety, stop hating on us in the comments, i have social anxiety but i know how to socialaze, yes it&#39;s harder with social anxiety, but not like thatSome of the people in this video clearly have some very very serious social problems most people with social anxiety are not that bad

Ever feel introverted because it’s actually boring to talk to the majority of the people?

I&#39;m not an introvert I&#39;m just socially awkward.

jubilee votes off black dude Felix: THATS RACIST also Felix, sees black girlFelix: I DONT TRUST U

Bro alex looked so uncomfortable why did they vote him I mean his face looked a bit red while speaking

Its not fat shaming its motivation 

I&#39;m an introvert and if I&#39;m in public I am completely quiet and if I&#39;m with close friends I will not shut up for even a second

Take a shot everytime somebody says ”like”

i THINK THEY ARE ALL EXTROVERTS ACTING LIKE INTROVERTS

Maybe I&#39;m an introvert

Me just getting triggered at how much they said “like”

I would not say i&#39;m an extrovert but i scream a lot but i am shy sometimes but I can like sing in front of people so I am in the middle Actually I feel like i&#39;m like 58% on the extrovert side and like 42% on introvert but I would say i&#39;m more extroverted.

the chubby woman might be the extrovert thohmmmmmm

wth i got an introvert or extrovert quiz ad on this vid

That&#39;s not how you say it Maya! Go back to SPEAKING SCHOOL!

<a href="">8:19</a> hahaha lmao  “the dirty, broken jeans” hahaha  boomer, you know what’s funny? I was about to tell the same thing to my friend while we were watching this together.

Pewdiepie: there is a saying in SwedenOggly boggle de oggle

They thought she should have been an introvert because of how ugly she is

since the pandemic its been ckear that im introverted all i do is play minecraft

Im not introvert just shy

i’m an extrovert but i just don’t know how to approach new people 

Pewdiepie: “ I wish they weren’t allowed to lie.”If that happened, can’t they just ask, “are you an introvert or an extrovert?” And then the game I’ll be over in like 1 minute?

Guys its so funny to watch pewds in 2x speed try it lmaooooo

I&#39;m INFP-T boys let&#39;s go

It takes so long for loaf

“I love sitting home and like watching movie” lol

Jag anar ugglor i mossen!

haha my sister is american and im quite introverted myself so whenever im with her I feel comfortable because she always breaks the ice

Pewdiepies best

om pewdiepie gillar detta betyder det att han kan prata sverige kanske han låtsas

All are fake. Introvert don’t like to be on TV

What? I wasn&#39;t expecting that

Pewdiepie introvert tip; dont go to America because they won’t stfu

maybe I should move to Europe

did anyone else think that the background of the thumb nail was jacks

I’m not an introvert I just hate 90% of people

Hi

<a href="">19:52</a> att least more honest than apple commercials

Du kan börja på min språkskola så kan du få lite repetition från grundskolan

<a href="">11:05</a> pewds do be spittin fax tho

I&#39;m proud of Felix because he hasn&#39;t got a British accent yet

entps and enfps are the most introverted extroverts in mbti! this is due to dominant extraverted intuition. without a doubt felix is an entp.

Round two 10 minutes Me: right ima head out

They are fake introverts. You can&#39;t force an introvert out of home.

You&#39;re PewDiePie : )

i talk alot, i am good at talking with people. I am an introvert

I KNEW IT!!Also, those introverts don&#39;t seem to know much about introverts.

.

&quot;everybody is on a spectrum&quot;&quot;They sure are&quot;dude im dying

Me intFerTe

i’m an introvert but that doesn’t mean i speak like i’m doing asmr and that i can’t have a normal discussion lol

I now want to live in Europe

This man is funny.

she even decieved the god of mischief... touche

The people in the comments act like being an introvert is a special thing

I&#39;m comfortable with silence but I don&#39;t like others feeling uncomfortable with silence which is why I normally start conversations

I knew it was her cos no introvert would be able to be with a person the same gender as they would want to be like everyone else and fit in

Maya: <b>exists</b>Felix: <b>SUS</b>

My sis is an introvert and when we are alone home she is wild

The alex guy sounds like james charles

<a href="">0:35</a> LOL!!!

When was the VIDEO made hmmmm. Why don’t u wear a mask  u shoudl look liek dis Edit:y’all think I’m dumb.itd a joke I’m not locked in a box house and no news

I could tell who the extrovert was immediately, the way she talked I could tell she was faking it

I’m ambiverted. When I was a teenager, I was suffering from hard depression and was at my most introverted. Even then I had zero anxiety  that’s not how introversion workssss

Ambiverted people: screaming

<a href="">11:08</a> yes pewdiepie, yes

Never trust a tiktok girl or someone who watches tiktok

I&#39;m not a full way closet introvert. There&#39;s a spectrum which goes from extreme extrover to ambivert to full way closet introvert. It&#39;s not like introverts have trouble talking or anything, they don&#39;t like to talk stuff other than what&#39;s in a topic of convo (imo). Introverts can be really really talkative with the person they are comfortable with. They won&#39;t even stutter in that situation and so am I. They hate crowds and so do I. Tbh defining whether a person is introvert or not is hard. Like there are many ways look into one situation, many person define introvert/extrovert according to their own perceptions

Why do half there voices sound like asmr

Pewds is ambiverted 

<a href="">19:30</a> Gfuel <b>GAYCUPS</b>

Every point about Americans being extroverted is valid

Next time I see a wild human I start screaming

isn&#39;t it subjective tho how you perceive yourself. Like you might think someone is super social but inside its really hard for them they&#39;re just successfully putting themselves out there

Ghosting someone isnt an introvert trait its fking rude

Why is the ripped jeans lady so annoying to me?

Alex sounds like an ambivert: more outspoken when it&#39;s quiet, more reserved when there&#39;s more conversation

In America extended periods of silence is generally viewed as awkward, and so a lot of people just kind of fill that void with meaningless filler, because it&#39;s better than nothing. That&#39;s negated by any activities though, like looking at a price tag, your phone, signs or posters... a lot of looking at stuff now that I think of it. It&#39;s mainly just that feeling of simply doing nothing with a stranger that starts to feel uncomfortable. We&#39;re also apparently really friendly to strangers compared to other countries. It&#39;s not uncommon to be smiled at or greeted by a stranger just walking by on the street in America.

ambivert gang

Me when the teacher asks me anything: <a href="">9:30</a>

As an introvert I admit that I actually love to go outside... I hate to interact with ppl who aren’t <b>really</b> close to me

H

Why would an actual introvert agree to this?  These are just extroverts with social anxiety

Hi

Im socially inept by choice

no!, v r introverts, we don&#39;t hit any button felix..

I FRICKEN KNEW IT!!!!! She was a terrible liar. Everything she said or did was extremely basic introvert.

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s this called but when I go to school and meet my classmates and friends even in everywhere, I fell like I&#39;m so socialize and talking more. But when I go home, I just stay home and dont go outside.

A true introvert won&#39;t even get into the game.

Ambivert 

I love these types of videos

A true introvert would always agree to whatever they say, just like when the cashier gets their orders wrong

wtf do introverts like to say there are introverts because i don&#39;t

I took a test and I’m ambivert which means I’m right in the middle

Someone: BreathesPewds: <b>MAYA YOU LIAR</b>

Omg at work and watching this with headphones, if you go to <a href="">15:25</a> Felix nose whistles...AirPods are too powerful...very distracting hahaha 

She is gonna be a legend in among us.

the thing is just that people confuse introvert with sad or anxiety, and extrovert with bubbly personality

They don’t know what’s the difference between intorverts and social anxiety

A confident introvert is a thing, we do exist

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m just a European!&quot;Me, a fellow European: about to protest--Also me:...That actually makes sense

Netflix is the classic introvert streaming service.

How did i know it all the way... maybe im an introvert then...

i knew she was lying, no introvert would dress like that.. or.. nevermind

No way that chick isn’t introverted

does anyone else get extremely upset when INFP is the rarest personality type, and everyone says that they are INFP, just me, ok...

I knew it was her from the very first round- it came across that she was deliberately making her posture closed off

Ambivert

This is like Among Us and it was before it was popular

I CAN HEAR THIS MAN BREATHING

i&#39;m going to say the girl with the bandana on her head ...Bruh I knew it when she said I chill and recharge at home before I can go out with people again.

I am an extrovert but when I have too too much fun. I end up crying after.

I&#39;m American, and I hate the forced conversation everywhere you go here.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m introverted or extroverted... I enjoy being in a group of people, even if I don&#39;t know them. But I also don&#39;t enjoy talking much, the closest person in my family was my grandfather, and he almost never spoke, unless he had to, but everyone knew him and loved him. I love quiet conversations, like speaking through body language. It feels more natural.

i&#39;m breadtrovert(edit)HOW

As someone who is leaning towards an introvert spectrum, I sussed on her from the very first time she talks. Everyone was so natural about it,  but she described an introvert like how you would found on Google desc, which is somewhat not 100% true. It was a textbook description.

The Meyers-Briggs test is a load of crap. It means literally nothing, and has no scientific backing

They act like introverts are disabled

when random ppl talk to me i just say wow thats crazy so many times they get innoyed and leave

I knew she was the mole when she says she watches tik tok

I was immediately suspicious of her when she said one of her hobbies is being on tik tok. It doesn&#39;t sound like an appealing thing to me, an introvert. It&#39;s kinda like if someone said they spend a lot of time on facebook, why would you do that if you get exhausted  by people? The ones that said they like hiking or reading are way more introvert-sounding.

who else thought Antoine was the secret extrovert purely cause he lied in the anime video

the way they associate social anxiety with being an introvert bothers me so much, like they&#39;re not the same thing lmao

There&#39;s no such thing like introvertism it&#39;s social fobia ffs.

Hej då vi ses nästa vecka.

They say “like” to much, that is a sign of low confidence

I think they&#39;re all faking. They&#39;re not really &quot;introverts&quot; they just let themselves believe they are because they are &quot;different&quot;.

Any Ambiverts here?

tf is an introvert/extrovert???

Jesus.... we&#39;re introverts not boring ass people with social disability- WHY ARE THEY ALL WHISPERING?

I couldn’t stand there quietly for a minute

As a Swedish person, it’s strange hearing pewds speak his native language

U r an extrovert

I thought pewds nose whistling was my nose whistling lolol

It&#39;s actually total opposite of what people think when they put a group of introverts together I know a group of introverts and they quiet noisy when together and it&#39;s so funny 

where minecraft

Someone with social anxiety could be an introvert.But an introvert doesn&#39;t necessarily has social anxiety. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS. Introversion in itself isn&#39;t a disability but but social anxiety is.

Just took a test. I’m 100% introverted

This is just kinda among us but the imposter is an extrovert

I gotta move out of America apparently

Introverts read people&#39;s mind and seep through their heads to speak :&quot;D

“go back to speaking school”

Felix is an Ambivert somehow

It&#39;s possible to say that an introvert can&#39;t be arrogant, and as arrogant people are not good, maybe more should be introverted

&quot;i feel ya&quot; by Pewdiepie

I&#39;m with Alex 100% if I&#39;m surrounded by introverts I&#39;m become the most extroverted person there is

In the second round there all white except one and then when they get to the end he goes yup it’s her

girl: its hard to open up to peoplealso her: continues to tell her backstory on why*

Damn she was good at that,she&#39;d be that imposter that&#39;ll kill you all and will let you vote each other one by one but you won&#39;t figure her out and you won&#39;t even sus her.

There is one imposter among us

Well the reason that all the people you meet in America are extroverts is because all the introverts are inside

&quot;Am I Introverted or Extraverted?! - Jubilee React #3&quot;FIFY.

They talked about their dislike for people stereotyping introverts, yet, they vote out the “stereotypical” extroverted people.

My special proffesion:   Depression

everyone in america is an extravert...nah its just the introverts are at home lmao

Im an ambivert someone in between intovert and extrovert

Its simple none of them are introverts. They would never contribute to steriotypes

I love the ending! Unexpected

That silent round was awkward as fuck and totally pointless.

at the beginning it was like me whispering to my best friend in class lol

Please, people are much more than the weird stereotypes of their personality types. <b>Introvert doesn&#39;t equal:</b>- shy/socially anxious- depressed/sad/melancholic- unsociable- quiet/whispering all the time- hating people- can&#39;t have fun talking with other people<b>Extrovert doesn&#39;t equal:</b>- loud/obnoxious/annoying- stupid- can&#39;t shut up- can&#39;t bare to be alone- clingy- always partying- doesn&#39;t like to read- always smiling/laughingOf course, being an anxious introvert or a partying extrovert is not a crime. But it&#39;s possible to be a confident introvert or a depressed extrovert. I&#39;m saying that IT&#39;S ALL FINE.Whatever you think of yourself, whatever mental health issues you may face, you are valid and loved (unless you are racist/homophobic/transphobic/sexist etc., we not doing that here).

I am balding

Don&#39;t know if anyone said this before but Maya literally just said  she doesn&#39;t want people to think introverts are boring cause they can have fun but voted out Alex because she can see him at a party having fun.....lmaooooo

<a href="">14:38</a>Maya: I don&#39;t wanna offend anyoneMe: I just don&#39;t wanna interact with people

What in the name of akaashi keiji, it was 10:20 pm just some secs ago now it’s 00:30 am

I like how he had to use a scene from Jack&#39;s video for the thumbnail.

It&#39;s called an ambivert.

Felix feeling so betrayed: how can you just lie like that? Ó╭╮ÒBless you Felix, same haha

<a href="">11:27</a> omg bro that is litteraly it like I&#39;m from England and the amount of times I&#39;ve been on a dog walk and there&#39;s this person that&#39;s like &#39;good morning&#39; and I&#39;m like &#39;uhh yh it kinda is but eh&#39; and they like tell me there life story and I&#39;m just confused cuz like I&#39;m not ur step-dog so u don&#39;t need to be telling me this so like shut up plz (edit : fixing typos lol)

In every other odd man out episode if you are quiet everybody call you the mole but in this episode it makes you seem less like the mole

the guy was the most INFJ person i have ever seen lol (i am an INTJ)

Wanna know something really cool?Wait for it ... BEING SHY AND INTROVERTED ARE NOT THE SAME THING!!! facinating!

Beth looks so cute

Wth it was her

I think they confused being socially awkward with being an introvert

they say introvert how it was an illness, why that, it&#39;s just an characteristic

as an introvert, this is physically painfull to watch

people just forget about amniverts

ok but like people think being an introvert is being shy or having social anxiety. it&#39;s not. you find social situations exhausting and get energy from being alone if you&#39;re an introvert. you can talk to people perfectly fine, and be really social and outgoing as an introvert and people just don&#39;t seem to realise that.

Me: <b>watches a pewdiepie video in the middle of the night.</b>Youtube: WaNna ListEn tO raiN SOundS? (2 ads)

To find the introvert, look at their body language.

i like public speaking...

Fun Fact If you are both introvert and extrovert you are an ambivert. Kinda like pewds

<b>Me an omnivert going into Odd Man Out</b> : I&#39;m going to end this whole man&#39;s career.

VOTE OUT THE IMPOSTER

But Pewdiepie I like public speaking am I lying to myself?

Pewdipie is an ambovert

U ambivert??

Hold up Felix.... I personally really do like public speaking.

they say &quot;like&quot; A LOT

&quot;maybe im just european&quot;

so many introvert/extrovert preconceptions in this video...

Big pp tay

all mbti nerds know for sure they got their type from 16personalities lmao. the infjs would’ve spotted the extrovert too easily.

Is that Antoine from jk ?

I think im introvert cuz once with my friend i was inteoduced to some of his friends that were strangers to me and everytime someone asked me i would just give thumbs up or down.

Its interesting how all of these introverts are ugly as shit

<b>Actually introvert doesn&#39;t mean they like to be quiet they just don&#39;t have anything cool to talk about while extroverts can babble on about how they like to put on their socks</b>

On behalf of all introverts they are not introverts they are fake introverts a subspeicies of introvert

The fact that the extrovert seems to understand better what being an introvert is than the actual introverts

I watch everything an 2x speed, so when I started the video, it was like watching in 4x speed.

You know there&#39;s a difference between being an introvert and being shy, right?

People really think that introverts are all shy, i get that it does play a big part, but there are introverts who are very outspoken and confident, but they just like to spend more time alone than with people.

Idk bout’ u guys but I get energy from food

Hey Pewds,Someone between introvert and extrovert is known as ambivert

I am a introvert who can talk to friends and family but not othersI like my teacher

I think he&#39;s like me i&#39;m ENFJ-T and i&#39;m 53% of an extrovert and 47% introvert idk i saw in picture it said it&#39;s third type or somthin 

I am 99% introverted even at home I am very quiet I am socially awkward too but I really want a boyfriend but I feel like I need to change my personality 

Notice how they say like all the time

I do not have social anxiety or a lack of confidence but still, I prefer not to talk to people and consider myself an INTROVERT. Is that weird?

Why do they always throw the money after they win.Like its money, who throws that ffs

It was so obvious to me from the third round. The way she tries to imitate a stereotypical introverted body language was a huge clue. My introversion is exactly like Maya’s and I tend to take over in groups when it’s quiet.

I am introverted but can still hold basic conversations without being the most awkward mf. I can be loud and friendly. Introverted means you prefer being alone and get your energy from being alone not that you are the most awkward fucker in the room. Being an introvert is not a synonym for being shy.

why does everyone make it sound like you can get diagnosed with introvert or something

Introverts aren’t afraid around people. Introverts just recharge their batteries by being alone after they have been around people for a while. They can be shy but it’s not a default

I think I’m an introvert but most people assume I’m extroverted because I’m outgoing and I love being onstage and public speaking in general. But I rarely actually want to go out with people and I’d much rather just be alone all the time. I’d so much rather spend my entire weekend in my room alone than with other people. But I don’t know, maybe I’m an ambivert or something

See you in 10 years when &quot;recluse&quot; is a spectrum and being a recluse &quot;doesn&#39;t mean ,like, you don&#39;t talk to people ever!&quot;.

Think most people are introvert, not many people are like “I LOVE TALKING TO EVERYONE AND BEING OUTSIDE ALL THE TIME”.

Isn&#39;t it like finding the impostor among the crewmates

<a href="">11:19</a> yes u are. It’s annoying sometimes

Pewds really do be lookin like eleven

This is among us but u can&#39;t leave the meeting

I consider being introverted means that you CAN talk to people. But you need to be alone to “recharge”. And just because you are introverted doesn’t mean you are awkward. I am totally awkward and shy AND introverted but they are separate things

yep i expected extrovert would win &#39;~`. i mean they can talk a lot or communicate, and they can build trust, they are friendly. they know what to do, they can act like introverts.

Spoiler:Felix is the introvert.

The one reading this and not liking neither replying is an introvert.

USOO DA .....LIES!!!

Me speaking norwegian: <b>understands the ugler i mosen part</b>Me speaking japanese: <b>understands うそ！meaning «lie» hehe</b><b>laughs nervously</b>

The hardest part to being an introvert is extroverts.

I still don&#39;t understand the energy thing.... I don&#39;t feel any energy loss in partys Or stuff I would  just prefer not going but if I am going with friends I will not be feeling drained

13: 06 that&#39;s me  ..... With other introverts i will be the first to break the ice and be more extrovert and I think felix said the perfect distinguisher Extroverts will talk to Strangers like they know them for ages while Introverts Mostly come out to the people they know and they are comfortable with

This was among us before among us was popular

Among Us before it was mainstream.

This was easy for meto figure out

0       0    V,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I took a personality test and I got the mediator which is an introvert personality lol

felix is smart, u should be my therapist or the demon on my shoulder.

What exactly is an introvert? Because this is making me confused.I don’t like looking at people when i speakI don’t like calling someone and i try to hide when i’m in a public spaceAm i an introvert or just shy or something?

I&#39;m an introvert and I could already tell it by first look cuz she&#39;s literally acting like the stereotype introvert type wearing comfy clothes and talking with a whisper and stuff.

UGLER I MOSEN!!! Samme som i Norge haha

I was kinda sus when she said she had a gf I mean 

Have you guys done a personality test?Introverts: Yes i failed

I didn&#39;t sus Tay bc she was nervous and she talked like that and all, BUT NOW THAT I THINK BOUT IT, SHE WAS NERVOUS BC SHE WAS THE IMPOSTOR

I watched strating of this video, then watched that video, and now I&#39;m listening to pewds&#39; opinion

Guess I&#39;m just socially awkward

The word for being both introvert and extrovert is called ambivert in case anyone wanted to know

As an introvert any time I saw a cute introverted girl, I imagine myself as if I were there and how we would Match up well since we&#39;re both introverts, Then I remember 2 introverts can&#39;t meet because we&#39;ll never be outgoing enough to find each other online or in person

I feel like the pandemic made me introverted

I knew it was her. She was talking too slow and quiet, it was forced.

It means owls in the mossI&#39;m expecting owls in the mossWhat does this even mean?!

Nobody’s going to ask maya questions because they are introverts meaning she can just go along with them and be safe. Nvm

Best way to find out is to look at everyone’s playlists. Introverts and ambiverts tend to have really unique tastes or tastes that fall in line with a friend group or an internet community (ambiverts a bit less),  and an extrovert will like what their friends like/what’s popular or just not go out of their way to listen to music altogether. As an ambivert, if you’re spending a lot of time alone and don’t have a taste specifically catered to your thoughts and feelings, shit gets boring very quickly.

Anxiety is&#39;nt real!!!!!!!!!

Ambiverts exist you know.

I’m so much more comfortable with new people and groups of people than I am with people who I already know and one on one. Most of the time I avoid hanging out with people because it’s usually one on one and it feels so awkward. I’d much rather go to a party or a group outing. So it’s weird because I feel like an introvert since I spend most of my time alone but I’m basically an extravert I think lol

Jubilee ASMR

I am an extrovert, I just took a test

The introvert at a party is always the grill master.

People don’t really understand what introverts are... I’m an introvert and yes I recharge by spending time alone but I am not shy. I love talking to people and it’s easy for me, I’m outgoing, I love partying, I’m confident. I just recharge by spending time alone. Being an introvert does not mean you’re shy. More people need to understand this LOL

The unus annus tick

<a href="">1:31</a>: timerMe: <b>Unus Annus flashbacks</b>

All introverts look the same

Pewd’s reaction at <a href="">17:00</a> is just so childish it’s funny

There&#39;s 1 extrovert among us

When he said introverts don&#39;t deserve moneyMe:

The girl with the dirty and broken jeans

as an introvert.. 

Who&#39;s that in the left in thumbnail? Not pewds tho

i hate human interactions 

&quot;i feel like im both introvert and extrovert - felix&quot; thats called an ambivert

mayas teeth divorced

&quot;You need to go back to speak school&quot; 

I probably would have been voted out straight away, because I&#39;m very introverted but I&#39;ve been told that I come off as very confident and straightforward being shy is not the same as being introverted

When pewds said the thing in Swedish for a half second I was excepting him to say it in English and I thought he was having a stroke

im gonna die alone and nothing will change that

The term is Ambivert

You can be friendly and an introvert FYI

ah yes broken jeans

As a latina myself, i am very outspoken to estranger, is it a cultural thing comepletly? , no but it adds

I think you are PewDiePie and that good enough 

Lmao I thought it was her first because she acted the most introvert (so I was like &quot;Maybe on purpose?&quot;), then I was like nah and then she turns out to be an ENFJ like myself whaaat  hahaha I feel her though the silence round would have been painful for me although I am pretty balanced.

I&#39;m an introvert and those people just look autistic to me

Bruh can they talk without saying like every two seconds?

introverts try to be like an extrovert but can&#39;t, so thats the clue that gives it up

I am an introvert and I talk normally and like to go outside.

I&#39;m an introvert

&quot;She should be in: Find the sociopath&quot; nah brooooo 

brah, what happend with pewds videos, there are like 4 f# add kkkkkkkkkkkkk

 Your comment that all Americans are extraverted made me laugh. That&#39;s just called a cultural difference.

I have a feeling, she tried too hard for the outfit.... The real introvert more like calm and not-attracting atention outfit.

Guys anxiety is not real

So Felix is an ambivert right?

The moment she said I like staying at home watching tiktoks i knew it was here 

<a href="">17:42</a>

<a href="">11:28</a> <b>laughs in is he gay or european</b>

MONKAS I would&#39;ve never have guessed her

I thought I was introverted but I changed because I didn’t want to be associated with people like this

Okay but the giggle she lets out when she won was adorable ngl

I hate that you can&#39;t have a moment of silence having a conversation with an American (as an american) without it feeling awkward or you being seen as rude. What if I simply just don&#39;t want to talk or know what to say whats the problem with that. What if I had a problem with you wanting to talk.

there is one impostor among us

lol

I’m a quiet introvert who’s confident 

That ENFJ girl used that Fe to manipulate them.

The times they same like is like insane in this video.

The way  they portray an &quot;introvert&quot; makes us all look boring as hell.

There is 1 impostor among us

It&#39;s called an omnivert

could someone put a &quot;like&quot; counter on this video?

someone said &quot;they all were extroverts because an introvert couldn&#39;t do this&quot; LIES!sometimes you want to be something else and have fun, and talk and enjoy life without prejudice and fear. so maybe she has that feeling at first when she accepted! Also, at the end when she goes away and didn&#39;t pick up the money is because her brain was so alert the whole episode and when she finally escaped because the game was over, her brain and muscles could relax. like she was in pressure. that&#39;s why she said &quot;so i just collected?&quot; when she forgot the money, because her brain really really works in pressure and fear and being criticises by others. And also other fact that she may be na introvert is because of her physical appeareance and i bet she has suffered from that a lot because from stupid people.

also, i knew who the introvert was from how she was talking an dstanding etc :))) yeesssi&#39;ve been an introvert 100% for a whole lifeand no, she didn&#39;t lie. she really pointed out what it feels like to have panick attacks from anxiety when she was talking about loking at the wall :))

The bullshit with &quot; i overthink a lot so that&#39;s what is keeping me up at night&quot; GOOOODD!!!!!As an introvert you can OR NOT  overthink at night, you can OVERTHINK AT MORNING TOO AND SLEEP LIKE A BABY AT DOWN or don&#39;t sleep at all. YOU ALSO CAN NOT OVERTHINK AT ALL AT NIGHT OR MORNING OR DAWN OR SHIT. you can imagine scenarios or just stay up late late to fricking hope that you can sleep at night. Sometimes dreams are weird, sometimes you don&#39;t dream at all and the next morning you feel like you slept an eternity and feel like a robot who just shut his eyes for a second for a checkup in the laborator or be tired as fuck even from 8-12 hours of sleep BUT THAT DOESN&#39;T MEAN WE OVERTHINK all the time. NOT just OVERTHINKING keeps you up or made you sleep like a crap, but also the fact that our brains are in a constant alert makes us tired or very euphoric.Also the bullshit with public spaces, when they said they like to listen to music or read it&#39;s a NO from an introvert. Introverts dont like that people look at them and if you read a book or listen to music it doesn&#39;t mean that you are disconected from around. You may see us reading or staying on our phone but our minds are at what may happen, what is happening and what happened before we took our book/phone in our hands just to be watched as &quot;normals&quot;. we need to watch our back EVERY FRIKING SECOnd, AND ALSO TO NOT CAPTION ATTENTION FROM OTHERS BUT ALSO TO STAY IN OUR CORNER .WHEN YOU HAVE ANXIETY, like really bad anxiety you don&#39;t listen to music in public or read a book &quot; to disconect from the world&quot;(i didn&#39;t say that, books and movies does for us) we need to fricking watch our back because we are in an alert EVERYTIMEi really hate when people think they know what an introvert person feels just because they read bullshit posts on instagram or facebook

Felix: are you an introvert or an extrovert? Ambiverts: both.both. both is good

From the begging I was thinking emma

Looking Back at this this basically was Among us before it was popular

Ripped jeans sus.....

Nah! You are an ambient just like meh. I love you so much bruh, I hope one day we can have a sleep together

this is basically among us but  without the voting on people because of color and no murder lol

I am a introvert and I can talk normally

Jubilee is the OG among us

I can relate to pewds soo much when he says both.

its so awkward watching introverts talk ngl

Maybe people wont shut up around you because you have 107 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.

I guess you&#39;re bitrovert

Amug us real life

I totally understand about feeling awkward by filling the silence with useless conversation. A lot of people find me awkward or “too quiet” but I just don’t feel the need to talk. I’ll talk when necessary. I prefer to listen and gauge people’s reactions

i love public speaking

I&#39;m an extrovert but I like being by myself. Thats why most of my friends are introverted. We like our own time. I can meet people maybe once or twice a week till my social battery runs out. This whole introvert vs. extrovert shit is annoying. Being a introvert is not a disability. I dont understand why this is so important to people.

You have an introverted personality type Pewds - INFJ.  There are 16 different personality types.  Eight are extroverted, and eight are introverted.  The INFJ is the most extroverted of the introverted personality types.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re socially awkward, and why you can get up on a stage and own it.

Being an introvert does not make you socially awkward, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re quiet, and it honestly makes no difference to how you act around other people. I go to therapy and LOVE sitting and shooting the shit over life for hours with someone I don&#39;t really know. I can go to a party with one good friend and leave with 10 new friends. I might never speak to any of those 10 people again except my good friend. Maybe if i see them a handful more times, but you would never catch me texting any of them the next day like &quot;wanna get coffee?&quot; or ever.Often when even my good friends ask me to hang and i&#39;ve been home alone for many hours, I will pretend i cant go, and if I do say yes, i sit there for the next few hours debating whether to flake or not. 80% of the time I end up flaking and sitting on the floor with my dog and blanket, regretting not going, then i turn to some substance to deal with those feelings of how much I interfere with my own happiness.The 20% of the time that I do suck up the courage to say fuck it ill go, I am usually the one to take charge of the night. I vear off alone through a house of people i don&#39;t know, find a cool guy or girl smoking a cig, and go up to them and ask if they have a light. i have no issue making conversation with people I don&#39;t know, and i avoid small talk completely and usually hit them with a deep question about whatever is troubling me at the time to get their perspective on the issue and it acts as an icebreaker. Some people cannot do anything but small talk, even after you&#39;ve broken the ice. these people are not introverts. they are simply socially awkward and don&#39;t know how a normal interaction grows into conversation. However, since i do spend so much energy out with these people, eventually by the end of the night im just thinking about how much i want to go home and sit in my bean bag chair with my dog and play PS4 or watch pewdiepie. It takes me a few days or even a week or so before I feel like I can truly expend that same amount of energy again that I spent that one night partying.For the 4 or 5 hours I spend out with other people, it takes me about 10x that amount alone before I have the energy enough to be outgoing with other people. During the &quot;recharge&quot; phase, I am still extremely confident, I have no problem speaking to other people, however, I will be extremely short winded, and may force the other person to endure multiple long pauses of &quot;awkward silence&quot; to force them to do the talking so that I don&#39;t have to. and If they don&#39;t want to do the talking, all the better.

You know most of us are ambiverts!

bruh this aint introvert, introverts someone who doesn&#39;t go to a party because they&#39;d rather stay in and hang out with a few people. the people in this game are just creeps with low confidence. and the fat chick at <a href="">10:30</a> saying she&#39;s confident is lying to herself. if u are actually confident, youll come across as that to other people.

All i can think is these people would get voted out of omong us

I dont know why, but i like to be Alone more, then im with other people. Am i introvert?

I&#39;m a midtrovert

Lol I am Ambivert

Why do I suddenly want a introverted gf

So no ones gonna talk about how he looked like lil huddy in the thumbnail

Alternate title &quot;The Greatest Impostor of All Time&quot;

Who else is high af eating popcorn and watching this vid

I get very tired from being alone

Ah this was posted on my bday lmaooAnyone else

Lol this game reminds me of Among us , here extrovert is the imposter

An Introverted person feels exhausted if the can&#39;t hear their thoughts thats it for me

how dare you have fun at a party mortal

so cringe

Introvert+extrovert=ambivert, half of both

An Introvert probably gets laid more, what a shame I&#39;m an Extrovert

I barley paid attention and still got it right. It’s the small signs

Just commenting to say I am here at 6.9 Million views and 420k likes

I have insomnia and what she said is 100% true but I’m an extrovert, just about most of the time since I am an American who love meeting new people so I think it’s her fosho

as of 10/25/2020 the video had 420k likes, lets get 69k dislikes

People be playing among us

I would&#39;ve loved it if anyone just straight up said: &quot;I&#39;m an Introvert but I&#39;m not fucking weird or shy. I just enjoy time alone that&#39;s it...&quot;

This is like Among Us

According to this, Norway is introvert

i think its the middle one because she looks in the eyes of the others too much

having an introvert friend is actually fun

<a href="">7:59</a>

God damn this kids. I am 18, I can be an extrovert when I am recharged.Why are they talking so weakly!Ughhh

All of a sudden I am so judgemental in front of this video!!

Among us in real life

Pewds, you are what society calls anambivert.

I am an introvert, and I feel like I am way more confident in myself because of it.  I feel no desire to make large amounts of friends, and if someone or a group of people don’t like something I do, then I don’t care.

The problem is, you can just look up what us introverts act like because there is a lot of research on it.

the extravert was clearly acting she was obvious at least to me...

THERE IS ONE IMPOSTER AMONG US.

This is like a weird game of among us...

I am not an introvert.. I am just a fat as  brainless creature.. Who doesn&#39;t have any qualities to have some confidence..i would love to be that human who can easily become friends with other people.. NORMALLY..i wish i had some more friends.. I wish.. So that i dont have to wait fr my friends to finish their chats with their stupid boyfriends...and wait fr an entire life to get an answer in group chat..

sis intovertrd ppl can be good socially but they just get drained sound ppl

The women were were more manly than the gay

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m just european&quot;

<a href="">7:55</a> thats meeee!

The whole game be like:There&#39;s 1 extrovert among us

maya just so quiet over there lol. i didn&#39;t even remember she was there for the half the time

No extroverts can be shy around strangers. Not just introvert

I hate people and I&#39;m both extrovert and introvert lol

Emma is high confidence and not awkward. She is not an introvert

I&#39;m mixed 100%

When pew die pie starts speaking facts but the pills the I’m jus joking lol

I think pepl take introverts as those who lack confidence or are to nervous to talk or somethingBut that&#39;s completely wrong ,we introverts don&#39;t like talking to somebody new

Most people in America don’t talk to strangers but when they see you PewDiePie they’re going to say hi because you’re famous lol

I am an extrovert

Trooolllloooooollllloooolllloooollloooooo

does anyone els think the black girl is an INTP ; I&#39;m one and I relate so much to her

I can totally relate on that <a href="">7:46</a> and I hate   it, like I really want to speak up and say my opinion but I overthink it too much that I miss my chance.

The world literally thinks that being an introvert is like a disease or something. WTF.

This video got recommended to me after watching a bunch of Among Us

This video haves 6,9 million views atm

i&#39;m an extrovert to close persons, and an introvert to every person i&#39;m not really close with. like its normal right?
