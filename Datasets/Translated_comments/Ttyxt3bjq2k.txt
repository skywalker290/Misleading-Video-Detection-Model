good for him

I met the love of my life in o.c.Ca.she worked at that Platinum Plus when they got busted.shhe said Mr Lunati was a gentleman.she. made a fortune and was never trafficked. She received 4 years federal for a half gram of dope or ass she said for not testifying against Lunati. Her boyfreind of two years was an undercoverfederal pig that got her busted. She passed away but every story she told me checks out perfectly

This just keeps happening.

Well the cop spending 30 years in prison for murder ing that guy.

I&#39;ll never move back to SC

Kkkanda is the same terrorist country.

He should have not ran.

Fake

How can you listen to Everlast and have so little chill?

Why run if your innocent?
the song and the situation... just ironic

Florence SC I live in effingham South Carolina

Was a suspect in a violent crime?  No insurance or other paperwork is why you die by cop?

The police officer shot him because he ask him to stop  but he never stop !!!

Why he run  !?

He is clearly jogging.

If I was the other dude I would have drove off or dipped.

Stoopid vid

How would you know this was a hoax, does news media use green screen and high technology and do a street theater hoax?!

That tells us absolutely nothing.

Cop had a good soundtrack.

why  officers touch the car before spoke to the driver,.. please exlpain

<a href="">2:34</a> why did he run! Had he not done this, he wouldn’t of gotten shot!

.WAW.HE.RAN.JAJAJA..MAN.STUPAT.RUUNN.YOU.FOOUUL..<a href="">DONt.RUN</a>

&quot;Then you really might know what It&#39;s like to have to lose&quot;

I say the cop was right to shoot him, except he should have aimed for his leg instead!  No more running and no other ramifications to have to deal with!

Everybody saying a fleeing man should be shot in the back and killed for whatever reason may you fill the lake fire  I searched the comments and none of your reasons was worth a but yet ye are of your father 

Then you might really know what it&#39;s like to get shot in the back when running from the cop...

Someone needs to research the different fight or flight response of different people.

In the old days if you shoot an unarmed man in the back , you got the rope.

There appears to be two people in the car.  One runs and the cop chases the runner. Wrong.  The dangerous one is the one in the car. He can chase the cop and shoot him in the back.  I was taught in army basic training that if you are escorting 2 POWS and one takes off running you shoot the one that doesn&#39;t run.  That makes sense because, because if you raise your rifle to shoot, the other POW can attack you.  Never turn your back to a possible armed felon.

Why run ?..

That black man was not very smart. He lacks common sense and knowledge

I AM THE LAW!!! RESPECT MY ATHORI-TIEE!!!  TURN PUSSY INTO DICK GIVE HIM A BADGE!!

PiGS

Using deadly force to stop a pursuit ? Obey or die ?..Sounds NAZI to me..

Cop says break light out funny I saw two break lights

This is why officers should&#39;ve K-9 dog on sight, ready to catch the suspect.

I don&#39;t run unless I know I&#39;m gonna evade...foot pursuit hot pursuit...I don&#39;t trust 12 at all...and I&#39;m scared of tasers

Hopfully that cop dies in jail.Even though he ran from the cop, there was no grounds at all to murder him! At all!

Amazing.....criminal caught at a police stop...runs. Gets shot. And the commenters here blame the police officer. And say he shot because he is a racist. Amazing. BLM is a movement to delegitimise the police and the courts. If you let that crumble youre cooked, all of you.

Technically it doesn&#39;t show anything there&#39;s a huge chance of defence and I never heard any shots so all you haters with all that black this or black that can fuk the fuk off

Cop has good taste in music

he&#39;s black,black lives don&#39;t matter,I mean,it&#39;s not like the cop shot a white guy or something,get over it.

Good job officer....

The cop got 20 years.

Like why did he run over a break-light and how y’all determine racism from this video ffs petty ass people. He got shot cuz he ran probably because the car was stolen or he had a warrant ... a basic moron knows not to run from the cops ... he got shot cuz he’s stupid. Not because he’s black. His skin color didn’t make him run off? His dumb ass decision maker did. Y’all need to get off this racism shit. You see it everywhere when nothing merits the conclusion. The word is losing meaning. I know I hear it these days and I dismiss it immediately. The boy who cried wolf ring any bells? It won’t end well. That’s a guarantee.

The gun had a silencer....lol

Cops are jamming to tunes

Had no reason to shoot him, but why did he even run

Dude was killed for just running away

Of a taser!

posting a video that does not show the content of the title seems to be the work of an inbred...imo

Society 1 thugs 0!

No one was shot people not the guy or the cop .....get over yourselves

both sides were wrong point blank.  he shouldn&#39;t of ran and the cop shouldn&#39;t of used deadly force.  its jus that simple.  both of them were wrong

my favorite part of the video is all of those moments in which the man is filled with hope of not seeing that murderer again,  all of those moments he spent running, filled with hope....im hurting,  cause I really want to kill the cops, for all I know, all I&#39;ve seen, all I see....im hurting and I tell myself the part of the man&#39;s hope, to ease my pain this moment, to feel better and it works a little.

They said he was pulled over for a broken tail light. The tail light was not broken. I think the cop was profiling instead. The cop probably thought the Mercedes Scott was driving was stolen because Scott was black? Cops do profiling regularly because they are human. I&#39;ve witnessed cops profiling.

Thumbnail looks like naruto lmao

The end!

i know this is totally off the subject, but does ANYONE KNOW the fantastic song that&#39;s being played on the radio at the start of this video ? - it&#39;s fantastic but I don&#39;t know who the artist and song is called ??- please help !!!

Black life matters!!

Cops Chased me Fleeing! hit me with there Car Called dispatch  and said they hit a deer! Cops Are Nazis Fucks. and hope you all go to hell Cop lovers

Your 3rd brake light is out. Lol

That&#39;s why you DON&#39;T RUN!!! IDIOTS, SMH...

His family&quot;forgave&quot; the officer today-for $6.5 million!

I can&#39;t believe the irony of the cop listening to that song

Why is the idiot getting out of the car and running away.

...and then you really might know what it&#39;s like....

What happened to him is WHY he ran. They don&#39;t believe in black rights.

Step 1:  Don&#39;t run from the police or bad things happen - period.  I sympathize with the police officer - you never know when that fool is oging to turn aroudn with a gun..

Both people were wrong.  Sad but true.  End of story.

Just wait until martial law comes into effect. Officers will be slaughtering innocent citizens left and right to purge criminality.

didnt need to get shot in the back, our tax dollars would have had to be spent jailing his ass now we are paying to jail the cop.  oh well.   glad he is dead, worthless shit sack.

THIS IS BULL i NEVER HEARD THE GUNSHOTS OR THE SECOND POLICE CAR !
That shitty music makes this video hard to watch.

ya why would a white girl be running from a cop ?

This is scary because you know it were a white girl running from the cops she wouldn&#39;t get shot

WOW! the fact some of you are taking sides with a murderer. smfh

No justification for shooting - regardless of race.

no insurance no drivers licence no proof of anything then runs. guilty of something. then the cop catches up to him then he runs again. i would be thinking maybe the car is stolen and this guy is running because he did something really bad.

Don&#39;t ever run. You will die. Get that through your heads.

Look on the bright side. Trump&#39;s gonna stretch gun laws wide open &amp; general public gonna have more firepower to counter these trigger happy cops for real next time.

<a href="">00:43</a>

Why&#39;d the dumb fucker run?

he ran, obviously had something to hide, hard to feel sorry for him.

What I thought was odd which most people didn&#39;t catch was that he said he stopped him for his THIRD brake light being out. How many officers on patrol even usually care at all about a 3rd brake light? Even though it us technically an infraction in some states I feel this was just used as an excuse to make the stop.

First, I have serious doubts that a white guy in a Mercedes would have been stopped for a brake light.  Second, after Walter Scott ran, he was shot with a taser.  When he ran from that, the cop shot him in the back at a distance of around 25 feet.  The cop said he &quot;feared for his life,&quot; which doesn&#39;t make sense based on video evidence.  However, let&#39;s say that  the cop was scared and that black man should have complied.  Would a court give Mr. Scott the death penalty for his actions that day?  What about 10 years in Prison?  How about 6 months in the county jail?  Doesn&#39;t matter.  Officer Slager decided that Mr. Scott should die for his deeds and thus executed the sentence.

LookHe should have let him runVouchered the carPut out a warrant for the guyI wasn&#39;t there, but it can&#39;t be personal, they run they runI&#39;ll catch ya another day

This wouldnt have happened if he didnt run... I am in no way defending the cop here. But it would save so much trouble by just not running....

You hear this black people white people say you should be killed if you run.

this cop was just plain pissed off and let anger get the best of him. Too bad some one had to die. Should not have shot this man.

Fleeing
I&#39;d rather die facing the piglet instead a bacc shot. They are trained to kill you so when they pull you over the are ready to blow your brains out. They kill kids too they don&#39;t care for human life. Cops will kill anything that moves wrong. PTSD from war and kill innocent Iraqi babies. They kill their wives and themselves so you know they will blast your ass

some of you people have stupid comments really stupid comments you are forgetting these are two men not just white or black but men and if he run get your ass out the car and get him not kill the man yall are so damn dumb that its sick you love your god but not your fellow man yall need help or a better mom or dad smh

That music

And the officer having that ridiculous music playing that loudly while his dash cam is on, just shows you how pompous and unprofessional that officer was. For the record, the Ferguson shooting was 100% JUSTIFIED!!!

This is truly a tragedy. As a police veteran, I don&#39;t believe that most of my fellow officers are racists. In fact, I believe just the opposite. Obviously, there are racist cops in our country, and racism goes both ways. Moreover, I can&#39;t say if this officer was racist. Chances are, this had nothing to do with the victim&#39;s race. As a veteran police officer, my professional analysis is that this officer was an ego maniac who was itching to get into a police shooting, so that he could go around and tell people that he had been in a police shooting. Moreover, you can tell that this officer was very smug, and I emphatically believe that he should rot in prison. While the victim (suspect) shouldn&#39;t have run away, and even if he did have the officer&#39;s taser at some point, there was NO JUSTIFICATION in shooting this man while he was running away. This is murder, plain and simple!!!

most of the shooting occur because people fight resist or run away. if you dont have a record you will comply. if you have an arrest warrant are a felon etc most likely you will fight or fly.all of the shooting from past two years that gained nationional attention you have people who either fought. or , resisted

I don&#39;t condone this shooting and it&#39;s a tragedy when anyone loses their life...but what do most of these police shootings have in common?? Whether the officer is justified or not, almost all of these shootings would&#39;ve been avoided if THEY DIDN&#39;T RUN AWAY. Not saying a cop has a right to shoot someone for running away, but the fact remains...most of these people would still be alive had they just complied.

Brake light?

Seems things took a turn for the worst. Cop was treating him with respect up until he ran. Problem is when someone with authority has a bad day maybe sick of punks running, bad choices can be made which put him in jail(Rightly deserved). Moral of story don&#39;t disrespect or run from police and probably 90% of this would go away. But you will never get rid of the small % of any group in the human race that are either racist or criminal intent within the police department or government or religious or whatever.

Agree with Yreelz.

fake.  training video.  everything is theatrical, except not blood when shots where fired and cop is wearing the same jump suit as Roof and doing the same kind of photo ops.

I don&#39;t see any crime in here, he just disobeyed an official order and those are the consequences...

&quot;No Humans Involved&quot; is not just about black people.  I am poor white.  I can tell you we suffer too.  We need to band together as a people.  Black, white, brown, yellow, red and green if there are any.  We need to band together against the large corporations that are allowed to do almost anything they want.  We need to take back our government in America.  Let us not be like the American Indians who didn&#39;t band together until it was too late.  Please do not be like Malcom X who said, &quot;The only way a white person could help is by bring the head of the white leaders to him on a platter.&quot;  This is a human fight.  Not a race fight and making it a race fight limits our power.

most police men always end up doing something like this for the most smallest thing in the world either being armed or not. you only represent enforcement of law not death.

Firing 8 shots was certainly uncalled for, and there was no need to shoot to kill for a simple traffic stop. But still, why did he run? of course something bad will happen when you run from cops.

This is set up. Who would run over a break light? If this was legit he would have backed hard into the cop car and then drove off. Nutzville

he shoot him because of a brake light the cop should be killed

He could of just shot him in leg, why shoot 5 times in back?

First of all, trying to make a run for it, bad idea. Second, if you watch the video the police officer shoots the man more than 5 times on his back, WTF. You can shoot his leg at worst but noooo, let&#39;s shoot to kill.Who the fuck does that officer think he is, that badge does not give you the right to take a life, that &quot;officer&quot; deserves extreme punishment and get what he deserves,  also to  set example for other power hungry pigs like him, the fact that you represent the law doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re above it.

So the actual shooting itself was never caught on video?

i get sick and tired of people saying your racist for this or that if you run from the cops you deserves to get shot most cops are good people its just the bad ones that make headlines

LET&#39;S STOP BUYING $100 SNEAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

stupid cop ...you have his license and his car why chasing he....track him later...murder

That was fucked up.  Police are getting away with 2 many shit.

Black people are scary and unpredictable

To all of those saying you deserve to die if you run? Fuck you

why Americans cop always shoot and aim to kill instead of aiming  at the feet  or the ass or  instead they always go either the head of vital organs . Boggles my mind. They should start  an ass shooting academy where they teach new officers how to hit someone in the ass and cripple the motherfucker.

hollywoood..

Conspiracy! This whole thing was staged! I seen the black dude eating fried chicken today.  

<a href="">

All just before a murdering cop kills an unarmed man then tries to cover it up. More cops are apt to do this than most people think.

So I&#39;m guessing the car was stolen?

That black man wasn&#39;t too bright.

cops listen to dumb shit on the radio

Dont run from pigs they shoot at unarmed civilians like it ain&#39;t nothing 

:)

if that fuckin pig  gets off the hook  i&#39;ll kill em myself and i&#39;m  ex- police officer and  i he gives  all police  a bad  image . i policed for thirty years and only had to use  force two times

why did he run so stupid

Wow...of all songs to be playing before these events.

Why the fuck did he run

Fuck The Police

Cop was being nice he just didnt like to ruuuun...he should not be charge with anything

He should have put a tv on his back if he wanted to run faster

this is fake..

might know what its like everlast ... classic

No big loss to humanity, he looked like a POS.

+zombi111980 you&#39;re certainly a young hillbilly kid, unable to accept or understand those who are not members of your tribe. killing is wrong in any circumstances. killing innocent people, and shooting them in the back 8 times is even more outrageous. that man should be chased, arrested and brought to justice. besides, two wrongs don&#39;t make a right. stop watching FOXNEWS, and think before writing....

Aaaah, now I can see why he was shot to death.

What does it matter if he ran away, he was a criminal, let more die.
Here is a Page for everyone to go to, to Unite against Bad Police officers. It has to Stop. This is a Peaceful Protest!<a href=""> It Around and Subscribe

Did anyone else notice the police officer&#39;s stated reason for the stop?  He said the THIRD BRAKE LIGHT WAS OUT!I don&#39;t see a third brake light on that vehicle.Not only did he murder the man, but he stopped him illegally, and lied about it.

Why did he run?

<a href="">0:17</a> i see TAIL LIGHTS   - i see lights
I see no reason why this should run and die like this. People should  learn not run away from the police regardless of their bad record. No one should die the way this guy died.

Reviewing the video a 2nd and 3rd time, it appears that Police Officer acted in a professional manner and did nothing wrong.

The suspect initially said he had insurance and owned the car.  Later the suspect said he hasn&#39;t purchased the car yet and did not have insurance.  Many would think this is a stolen car.  Then the suspect got out of the car---the Police Officer took the correct action--ordering the suspect to get back in the car.  Later the suspect runs from the Police Officer---usually regarded by both Judges and Members of Jury as a sign of guilt (i.e. suspect avoiding arrest for stolen car, or outstanding warrants for arrest, or failure(s) to appear before the Judge).  Here in this city, running from the Police will get you arrested or shot to death!----only stupid people run from the Police.

Can someone tell me how in the hell did they end up being in front of the dash cam on the cop car When the driver of the car took off he went left away from the cars..however they both ended up coming from the right side of the dash cam across the street.

When the cops stop responding to calls in your hood in fear that any action is going to cost them their job, don&#39;t be surprised.

All for a stupid third break light. Killer pigs are going too far.

Karma folks.  Things happen for a reason.  Most likely he had killed or raped someone and got away with it in the past. Karma came around and snuffed his ass out. You guys need to get used this already.  Dont run from cops, dont grab for a cops gun, dont rob stores and maybe you live a little longer.  Im totally fine with what the cops are doing.  We dont need these pieces of shit in society.

When was he shot?  I don&#39;t hear it.  Also, random person in passenger seat of car?

this still does not justify the shooting

This is such a racist video. I watch the First 48 on TV every day where black men kill other black men, but as soon as a white man does it Waaaa, whine, sniffle. If you were not so racist you would agree that if black men can shoot and kill black men, whites should be able to also. It is only your racist attitude that keeps you from seeing it.

Who was the other person in the car?

A taser to my knowledge is not a deadly weapon.  But then I suppose if the officer was temporarily rendered powerless, the subject could have easily gotten the cop&#39;s gun -- and that I imagine is why grabbing for a taser is a very stupid thing to do, as was running away like that.  If your actions suggest you have intent to hurt an officer, or possibly shoot him, it&#39;s silly to think the policeman isn&#39;t going to defend himself.  That being said, the officer was not tased, and I could excuse one shot in the heat of a dangerous moment, but to continue shooting at a man who is running away from you, with his back to you --- I&#39;m afraid constitutes attempted murder.  And he succeeded, so he&#39;s a murderer; no real way of getting around that.  (I do believe the guy tried to get the cop&#39;s taser -- likely after the policeman had removed it &amp; was about to use it.)Had he relented when the cop caught up to him, I believe he&#39;d be alive -- with no gun having been fired, either.  And I do not think the shooting was racially motivated though he committed murder nonetheless.   No one that I know of has yet to explain what would be a motive for the policeman to continue firing at a man like that.  How does one explain that?  It&#39;s mind-boggling.

I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t try to bury the body after killing the guy, then kill the horse to eliminate all witnesses.  I eagerly away the day that all law enforcement officers are required to wear body cameras.  This brutality has been going on for 100 years and now they are finally getting caught red-handed.... the police, not the criminals.

but why shoot him? no need to kill a man..

My comment is it appears to me that all of the black men that have been shot by police in recent months ALL were breaking the law prior to being shot, resisting police, running, fighting..etc or some other form of civil disobedience. Now with that said I feel in this situation the officer is 100% wrong, however as a black man I cannot support any protest or call to action petitions for Water Scott as he was another black man in violation of the law. His poor decision to run/struggle with police cost him his life. the officer as stated was 100% wrong, but as black people please don&#39;t make this guy out to be the innocent Joe who was gunned down by the bad policeman why eating ice-cream in the Park.  Just my thought.

Why the police man shot the black guycan you guys tell me I just want to know

Seems this Yankee &quot;gun mad&quot; bullshit is spreading  to the cops now. For God&#39;s sake somebody take control of these antiquated gun laws and ban the lot of them. It&#39;s quite obvious that American people have no idea how to handle guns or to be safe with them. This is madness at it&#39;s best.

third brake light

Wonder why he ran? So where was he taserd? Other reports say he was taserd when he stepped out of his viehcel? How was policeman&#39;s life in imminent danger?However this doesn&#39;t warrant to shoot him down as the murderous policeman did eight times?Over kill trigger happy? What I don&#39;t understand no attempt was made to perform CPR and the policeman was so calm? Other footage drops a taser by the deceased that&#39;s obvious.I haven&#39;t seen any threat to that policeman that warranted fearing for his own life.

The cop should go to prison. Simple fact right there.

It looks like there is a passenger sitting in the car??

these polices are stupid! why not use a taser or something

Is there even a law against having your 3rd brake light out?

He was trying to get into advance auto to get a taillight before the officer noticed. 

The South Carolina cops raided our home, when I was at work. They harassed and threatened my husband and our two young daughters, as eight SC police officers randomly searched for drugs, alcohol, illegal paraphernalia; anything that they could use against us in a court of law. We were both licensed professionals, and did not have even a drop of such items in our possession. Those charges were dropped, but we&#39;re all still quite traumatized by the experience.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Running has never hurt anyone. No one can no longer use the excuse of &quot;fearing for their life&quot; anymore. All of these pathetic excuses of human beings who are agreeing that it was &quot;right&quot; for the officer to shoot him 8 times in the back shall all rot in hell. I&#39;m disgusted at the mentality of people these days. HOW MANY TIMES HAS THIS HAPPENED?  How many episodes have you seen of &quot;cops&quot; people run all the time, unarmed, and never killed. That&#39;s nothing to kill anyone over... Running? I know someone is going to say I&#39;m pulling the race card, only because they are the  racist. It&#39;s some type of sick game officers like to play these days. one person gets away with killing an African American teen and now everyone wants to do it. What this dumb ass didn&#39;t know is that he wasn&#39;t going to get away with it. Its happened so many times that they had to make an example out of someone. Just know that everything happening is happening for a reason, can&#39;t do dirty in this world and expect good to follow you. America is going to fall, believe it or not, and when it does we will finally have justice. Hope people continue to kill police, they are nothing. 

IS = Police

So much for dash cams. Blind spot is a masterpiece of understatement. We got to look out for each other.

I have yet to see black officers display the same type of ill judgement.  Why is it always white officers that display this act against primarily black and brown people.

Question:  who was the other person/passenger and has any statement been recorded as to Mr Scott&#39;s conversation prior to bolting out of vehicle.PS Mercedes of those years often have electrical problems and should be checked completely before driving.  

Plain and simple murder , 8 shots in the back and unarmed ! How can people live in a system like this worser then any other western society to sick for words you US people should think about the laws you obey  !!  Peace

Maybe it&#39;s time American cops start driving patrol cars in pairs. It often looks like these cops panic, don&#39;t know what to do and just go for the gun.

what people don&#39;t realize is the police have a protocol to follow when using deadly force. they are first required to use non lethal means. in this case the Taser. when and if that fails the only other option is the service weapon. in days gone past they used truncheons but after the Rodney king incident and its optics law enforcement switched to the Taser. but what they never told the public is if the Taser fails they WILL START SHOOTING. a very similar incident to this happened in Pasco Wa the suspect had a rock in his hand they tased him. it didn&#39;t work and four officers gunned him down. it was all by the book. so until the BOOK is changed I don&#39;t see how we can charge these officers with any wrong doing. they are merely executing their training. Its the Training that needs to be looked at and changed if necessary. Still the man didn&#39;t deserve to die they had his information they could have picked him up later. unfortunately its these types of cases that will eventually get the laws and police protocols changed its too bad people have to die before it happens. RIP Walter Scot

His father said he ran because he owed back child support! Seems to be epidemic in the black African community. So, now we still have to pay taxes to support his offspring.

Why did the son of a bitch run away? ... Why is the man runs??
Body CamerasTap Our PhonesNow We&#39;re Ready for Domestic Drones!LAND of the FREE! ;-)

Why do black males hate themselves so much....?

And to everlast&#39;s classic &#39;what its like&#39;

WHat was the song at <a href="">0:05</a>

The funny thing is he wouldn&#39;t run to apprehend the suspect back but he ran back to get his taser

What s appened ?

I hope this murdering cop is killed soon.  How many more times are we going to put up with police brutality?

wonder why its has &quot;NWOO&quot; on the dash? aka NWO for you sheep obvious false flag

USA is safe as always lol

Running away does NOT justify cold blooded murder. He could have used other means of force instead of deadly force. This piece of shit cop thought he could get away with murder. I&#39;m glad this was recorded, because if it wasn&#39;t, no doubt he would have gone scotch free.

Ain&#39;t it funny how the media and government try to make a border between Mexicans and Blacks? Ain&#39;t it funny how Black and Brown people are the ones getting killed daily by police? (Especially white police). Ain&#39;t it hilarious how no other cop was charged with murder even though they where aware of what they were covering up? It&#39;s a comedy to watch the media now attempt to demonize the black man and make the white man seem like he was a good man and he had to make a good man choice by killing an inoccent. They always do this. Charge the cop with murder, then dismiss the charges later in court. So what&#39;s the point of even making a big deal about it? More ratings??? What has this world come to???

Wow he runs then u shoot and kill him and now how do you sleep at night

Here we go again another injustice. I didnt hear  shots but from watching a lil news, watching this, watching the youtube clip, and reading the comments I believe the individual is dead from being shot by the police.

Why is it that some people want to justify murder of an unarmed person fleeing? Many of you have big screen TV&#39;s and many of you watch CNN. Often times criminnals flee from police officers to avoid going to ..or going back to PRISON. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure that out. People  who choose not to flee from police and comply, generally have no criminal record or warrrants.Many of us across America have seen fleeing suspects before, some are involved in dangerous high speed car chases. You&#39;ve seen them..right? Chases where fleeing suspects nearly kill innocent people weaving in and out of traffic on major highways and city streets. It is rare for the pursuing officers in these extreme fleeing cases to open fire on the suspect. Usually when they catch up to them, they just open a can of Rodney King whupazz, cuff them and take them off to jail.(ALIVE) Yet some folks will go to their graves trying to justify this murder. There is no reason any person with a broken &quot;Third&quot; headlight should die because of it. Running away from a police officer is common among criminals with warrantsThey have 2 choice..Either turn themselves in or risk going to jail for several years usually they simply Haul Azz&quot;. If you watch any episode of COPS those drunk azz white boys are always running from cops, jumping fenes, etc. Never get killed..just tazed every now and then or get a dog bite on that azz.&quot;Running Away&quot;- This is not new people. Neither is it new for ANOTHER law enforcement officer playing GOD. It&#39;s actually the face of America rearing its ugly head yet once again. Sad..simply sad. Oh wait ..I almost forgot something..There is a passenger in the car with him did you guys notice that or were you distracted by all of the gunshots?  and the lyrics to that song in the officers car sounds a lot like they are saying the word DIE. Check it out for yourself. Is it a coincidence? This may lead to  possible premeditated act. Let me check the lyrics..does anyone know the artist &amp; title.

and those cretins and assholes want to learn to the world what is democracy..AXAXAXAXAXA...

How did the officer know the suspect didn&#39;t have a gun strapped to his ankle? I thought rule # one is YOU DON&#39;T RUN FROM THE POLICE. I&#39;d expect to get shot in the back too if I tested fate like that, and I&#39;m white! This whole thing is a tragedy for both of them though...

slavery continues in this country

USA is a police dictatorship state if police can shoot in any running man&#39;s back

black lives do not matter for racist white cops, slavery continues in this country

Getting pulled over for having a &#39;third&#39; brake light out is pretty weak.  Why didn&#39;t the cop just tell him to go the Advance Auto Parts store right there in the parking lot?  You can&#39;t script that kind of irony any better than this.  Cop&#39;s just trolling and profiling.  Do you really think he would pull this shit on some old white dude in a Mercedes with a &#39;&#39;third&#39; brake light out?  Seriously.  What&#39;s the person in the passenger seat got to say?  We haven&#39;t heard from them yet.  Everlast sings the soundtrack for this murder on the cop&#39;s radio.  Here&#39;s part of the lyrics:  &quot;Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all his pain.  You know it crumbles that way.  At least, that&#39;s what they say when you play the game. ...God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes.  &#39;Cause then you really might know what it&#39;s like to sing the blues.  Then you really might know What It&#39;s Like.&quot;

fake, more propaganda bullshit, do your research america, wake up!!!!!!!!!

Now it all makes sense.  He was running home to get his insurance papers.

He was not being held or under arrest at the time he ran, he actually wasn&#39;t breaking any crime. But even if so he did not put that pig or anyone else in danger and did not deserve to be shot down like that or in any way period

lol.. I remember seeing this in the gym and laughing. why? because now the cop is going to get off.. The case is way to far down in the year and they are going to justify his actions because the man  ran.. However, there is someone in the car still who did not run so the taught of the car being stolen is not going to work.. additionally, it is still day time. How can you pull someone over for a broken tale light... are you saying that when he hits the break you can see the light.. but then, you had to be following the car for some time to see this.. you had nothing better to do than to follow someone with a broken tail light???.. no murders to look for???.. lol.. this is too funny.. be prepared for another one to get off... that&#39;s all I have to say...

When are black people going learn that by just sitting in your car and saying yes sir no sir you won&#39;t get shot. The reason whites aren&#39;t shot more is because we don&#39;t fucking run all the time. Jim Carey said it best in liar liar &quot;STOP BREAKING THE LAW ASSHOLES.&quot; The cop shouldn&#39;t have shot him though and by doing it he really fucked over his fellow officers around the country, and now all the ignorant black people have fuel for their racial fires. I&#39;m sure responses will be well thought out and educated.

The real crime lies with the US Supreme Court. They ruled that deadly force is acceptable when a officer feels threatened.  In every case, such as this, that is the reason the officers claim to use deadly force. Its does not matter if you were threatened or not, you just need to say that you did feel threatened.Its why so many of these cases never do go to trial or why no charges is ever made against the officer.

All the hate why people chill the fuck down .............

Does ANYONE see the irony in the song playing on the police car radio?  Everlasts &quot;What it&#39;s Like?&quot;  HEARTBREAKING!!!! Read the lyrics to the song.  The cop was listening to it as he pulled over Walter Scott!! SPOOKY!!!!

You fucker
why officer? was only u cross your knees and shoot the legs.

chill on the raciest remarks

I&#39;ve seen the video where he actually shot him. Seems to me that his basic human right to life has been violated. he was not a threat to society afaik, he had no means to do harm to the cop AND he was running from the cop.This makes it fall under the chapter: use of excessive force, which seems to be a common thing amongst american cops.Seems to me that your cops need either much better training or much more accountability or better: both.

(°)({This was an unjustifing shooting this person was slaughterd in plain sight he was not armied and was running away this Police Officer should be charged with murder!)}(°)

People has to understand this, if you run from the Police anything may happen. So don&#39;t run or talk back to the Officer. I have never been arrested or has never been in a crime. So when Police stops me, I do now they have nothing on me.

Anyone think it&#39;s strange and incredibly unprofessional that the cop is blasting music while he&#39;s on patrol?



If you had any black people in your family, would you trust this cop around them?  Cops are supposed to protect us, not kill us.  I&#39;d like to think a vast majority of police are good people, but I&#39;m really starting to wonder.  How is it that the attitude that allows things like this to happen is allowed to persist?  Personally, I think the training given to police is largely to blame.  They are taught to use deadly force whenever they feel threatened.  The &#39;good ones&#39; are brave, and don&#39;t follow that rule all the time.  The cowards among them just pull out their weapons and start blasting away.

Can we all chill on the raciest shit please and thank you

The irony and timing of this song playing in the background while this tragedy is unfolding is unreal....  Especially since the last story of song (which is about a guy getting shot who wound up dead and his family getting caught in the midst of all his pain) was playing at the exact same time of this horrible event.  It is just SO haunting.... Almost like a voice from the universe bearing witness to the sadness and tragedy of this event.  I guess we all now know what it&#39;s really like...

While lethal force was clearly not needed, this video shows a stupid decision by the driver to run from a traffic stop. If you want to see a shameful police shooting of a man who was not breaking ANY law, check out my YouTube channel. This nonsense needs to stop.

&quot;Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all his pain, you know it crumbles that way. At least that&#39;s what you they say when you play the game&quot; - Everlast

we all feel bad when someone get shot like that,,but police will never shoot with out reason...

He ran but he can&#39;t hide. The police will surely locate him if he really did commit a crime. Why does the police feel he needs to chase and kill this man for?  What justice? This officer make the biggest mistake of his life and he deserves to be in prison for life. 

Did he say he pulled him over for his third brake light being out? I believe only two of the three have to actually be operational, though I could be wrong on that.

Are cops allowed to listen to bad country-western music while they are on duty?

Typical Black man,  owes over 18K in Child Support but drives a Benz....Then runs from the cops

There was someone else in the car.

The victim did act like a fool for sure. and the cop react stupidly by shooting (even one time). That wasnt absolutely necessary.

This is only half the story. Where is the rest? Why can&#39;t we see it? Makes you go, hmmm

It&#39;s dashcam footage. So, why does the audio sound like it&#39;s from a mic the cop is wearing? Why are we able to hear them running, rustling, wind, etc.? It wouldn&#39;t sound like that in the police car...and what about the passenger in the vehicle? Any statement from them yet?

Punk ass cop didnt have hands to fight, he already knew what he wanted to do, hope they fry that pig.

Thou shalt not kill !!!! One shot or 8 it simply doesn&#39;t matter. This criminal must be kept behind bars for wasting a precious life. I don´t live in US, and I simply don´t understand why those who are almost daily humiliated don&#39;t rebel...

You might consider running if you owed almost $20,000 in child support and were driving a (possibly stolen) car with no tax or insurance…

The cop&#39;s stomach was probably full with all the coffee and doughnuts he&#39;d eaten all day that this man could&#39;ve not have chased after a 50 yr old man with a limp on his foot.

This video is a reminder of why I&#39;m glad to not be living in America as a black person.Good job he was arrested though immediately. If you do that and give a sign to the community that it&#39;s wrong to shoot someone when your not in danger then people feel justice has been served. America is still the South Africa of the sixties and seventies. Even there they have more progress.

It&#39;s really complicated...

First dash cam I seen without a date and time on it.

<a href="">2:35</a>, he threw something from his left hand as he began to run, it landed near the front left of the police car.

Not sure why the man would run and possibly attack the policeman, but also not sure why the policeman didn&#39;t just incapacitate with a single shot to the leg. A whole clip in the back followed by telling the dying man who&#39;s not going to move &quot;put your hands behind your back!&quot; Is overkill. Here in London police only carry tasers, armed police/trident are separate.

Fuck police <a href="">#cpdk</a>

I&#39;m glad I live in Europe...

The only reason why whites dont like this is the cop was caught red handed. If i was no video that cop will be free. The number rule of white supremacy is racism doesnt exist. The cop broke that rule. So hes shunned. Thats all this is. Simple

Lesson learned - fleeing police and evading arrest doesn&#39;t always end well.

What is the problem with USA police officers?8 times to shoot someone in the back?

Very sad - Sounds like a bad guy with a uniform &amp; gun. Isn&#39;t it the way it&#39;s done in the U.S.. You run you get shoot?

To shoot and to serve Donuts.

watch the cop hit the light I think that struck fear into mr scott cause he just relized this cop was setting him up as he sees the cop hit his left rear taile light as though he was making up an excuse which puts the fear in this African American guy about a bad cop incident so that is why I think he runs I don&#39;t blame him as a white man who has experienced a police beating myself while in cuffs on my own video I have available titled wright county beating I was being raided by a phoney recycling report fo a very valuable piece of art from the Oscar h Schmitz collection with the seal certifieying the piece was appraised in 1937 of a 19th century champions work in which they were really after through what I belive was a fraud from my handicapped brothers nursing agency he would later be rejected from nursing care after video recording the incident by feb 4th he would perish from his wounds without having care for 2 1/2 years thnx to these criminal thugs I would of run myself

He ran and took the risk of being shot bad luck, the cop wasn&#39;t totally at fault.

As the song says, now you&#39;ll know what it&#39;s like to be in jail you PIG!!!!

don&#39;t talk to the police... they get scare and they shoot you..

I want to hear from the officer on Why He Shot! 

I know that Mike Brown &#39;hands up&#39; is BS and that he was trying to kill the officer.Also that fat guy in NYC who died from a heart attack with all that &#39;can&#39;t breathe&#39; is BS.But shooting someone in the back? This is just plain wrong. No excuse.

The sick irony of that song on in the background. That cop is no gentleman though, by the by laws of Marquess of Queensberry he shot a man in the back. He is a coward as deserves such treatment!

The cop shot him because he didn&#39;t put his hands up while running away.

You can see that this guy was not going to get far. What I don&#39;t understand is that if the cop was chasing him why didn&#39;t he just taser him when he slowed down.  He was 50 years old in terrible shape.  After he tuckers himself out (which wouldn&#39;t take long) hit with a few volts and he&#39;ll drop like a rock.  The cop WANTED to shoot somebody.  He was eager to do it and that&#39;s why he pulled the trigger.  

warrant for arrest, driving a car that may or may not be stolen, had a broken taillight out, ran from the police, fought the police for a taser, had possession of it at one point, those are the facts. when he was shot he was running away. the cop made the decision to shoot the man while the man had possession of the taser, watch that video again closely. why didn&#39;t the cop stop firing? thats training. once you draw and shoot, eliminate the threat.  the whole thing looks bad i know.

I guess I better pay those overdue library fees from high school before they shoot me to death.

I honestly don&#39;t feel bad. One less thug on the streets. If he wouldn&#39;t have run from the cops he would still be alive. 

The irony of Everlast&#39;s What its like playing in the background. The lyrics say it all...

Why are people surprised? They could not even get an indictment on the Cop who killed Eric Garner on tape or Cops that killed Kelly Thomas on tape and got away with it. Cops in US have been extra judicially executing people for many years and got the approval of juries and courts. No convictions. No justice.

Hmmmm... How about &quot;DON&#39;T fuck with the police&quot; and you don&#39;t get shot!

a) the officer should and likely will be convicted and serve time. i understand the man wasn&#39;t compliant, but a gun isn&#39;t a pursuit tool. call for backup and maintain pursuit. the gun is not for your convenience and is meant to protect yourself or othersb) the victim was a complete moron. in basically all of these cases we see in the news, it starts with the eventual victim making boneheaded decisions... feeling what was a traffic ticket, fighting off a taser, knocking it down, and fleeing again. even though this doesn&#39;t authorize deadly force, why would you escalate the situation and put yourself in the way of unnecessary harm? same with michael brown who reached for an officer&#39;s gun. even eric garner (though he didn&#39;t do much)... why resist arrest when there are several officers there? it doesn&#39;t justify the force, and the officer will serve time, but these ALL start with people making completely stupid decisions that put themselves in unnecessary danger

who&#39;s that in the car with him?

Anyone else notice the police officer is working (on duty) and banging music in his patrol car?

Under no circumstance should he even unholstered his weapon. The man running never put the officers life in danger. It&#39;s called a foot chase. Catch him and cuff him. To me the office deserves the murder charge. He absolutely abused his power. I will watch this unfold over the next year or so but I&#39;d be surprised if he doesn&#39;t get any but life in prison. 

Welp. Stop ONE to an acquittal. Because, he ran.( And, white people NEVER run from the police.) So,he &#39;deserved&#39; to be shot in the back 8 times. Here we go again.

if only he had stayed in the car, obviously he had something to hide. running away isn&#39;t the answer. the police officer went way too far &amp; there was no reason to shoot a man in the back no matter if he was running or not. nobody deserves to be treated like a wild animal. There should be a State Wide Police handling review so this doesn&#39;t happen ever again. God Rest his Soul.

Look people.  The man was already on foot running several feet away before the cop fired off 8 rounds.  Unlawful.  Period.  Murder in the 1st.....

Stupid people running away from cops while getting pulled over... It&#39;s not about black white yellow or brown... you are asking for trouble if you run away from cops cuz who the heck knows what you are going to do. And please don&#39;t pull the race card.



I don&#39;t get it why the US police has to be always this &quot;cold&quot; ... if i get pulled out of traffic by police here in austria we&#39;ve a nice chat, he gives me a fine and thats it, nobody would ever assume that every guy is armed and just wants to shoot you. What the fuck USA.

WOW and THAT song was playing?!?! Every official so far has gave negative reviews of the officer, and do you see the focus the cop had when he shot him? 8 shots and not a lot missed. &quot;Flight or fight&quot; is a natural, human response to any shady situation..

Perfect song to be playing in the background shout out to everlast

I&#39;M JUST WONDERING WHOs IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.

He didn&#39;t deserve to get shot in the back but it was kind of his fault because there was no need to run

He ran....I can&#39;t take any sides yet

Where is the gunshot?? 

I love how there just now showing this 

Why did he run though?

I feel so sorry for this guy, what I get from this video is a good man that follow his routines and simply made a mistake and got stopped, the man gets nervous because he knows that he can&#39;t pay the bills since he couldn&#39;t even pay for the child support so he made a quick choice and ran off (It&#39;s wrong but still understandable) Video2: The cop gets the man and the man gets even more nervous and attemps to run away from the cop while the cop tries to taze him, he tries to grab the tazer to avoid getting tazed by the cop and runs away (The last thing he thinks of is getting shot) 8 shots fired, the man gets shot and slowly dies, the cop panics , grabs the tazer and drop near the black mans body to make it look like the black man grabbed his tazer and the cops life was in danger, thank God that whoever filmed this footage filmed it and sended it to New York times, I can guarantee you that if he didn&#39;t record the incident it would result that this incident would now become known oor the cop was just trying to save his life and the civilians nearby, end of the story.

Speechless...
I&#39;m going to wait until all the facts come out before judging any of this.  Regarding this specific video though... He said he was pulling the driver over because his brake light was out.  Does it not frustrate anyone else that the video stops inches before ever showing the right tail light while the brakes are depressed during any point in the video?  What&#39;s with the white border line down the right side of the screen.  Its ALMOST as if the video was edited to cut it out.  If that tail light was showed operational at any point, this officer&#39;s goose would have been cooked for sure.  Any camera guys out there that can explain what I&#39;m seeing regarding the border?

He should have remained in the car and not have ran off.

HERE WE GO AGAIN.
