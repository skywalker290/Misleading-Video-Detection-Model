Listening From 1 year Best Song..Ô∏è
Almost 4 years of Ajnabee, still my fav 

Luckily this sing is underratedÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èLove from Bangladesh üáßüá©

I&#39;m through the worst phase of my life, failing in almost all aspects. Thanks for this song 

Even after 3 years, this is in my most favourite list

Such an underrated gem 
The lyrics are so deep and the music is no calm love you bhuvan sir

This song reminds me  memories of &quot;MY LOVE &quot;. Most of the scenes of this song mesmerize me about togetherness. Especially stairs Masti, Moving chair, watching movies, (getting ready for that person) , cracking jokes , holding hands ....  That was a special ERA for me which get demolished after several years . It still brings tears in my eyes by thinking that why it does not last long.... I just accepted all things as &quot;It&#39;s God&#39;s will&quot; and somewhere &quot;Yaad aaye to mil hi jaunga tujhko yahinNa bhi aaye to samajh jaungaThi mujhmein hi kuchh kami&quot;....  

This is the most underrated song yaarrrr what a depth in the lyrics Really salute you mannnHope This Song Gets Much More Attention Love you a Lot BB 

Anyone in 2023

After 3 years this song still hits so hard  made a masterpiece by a legend 

In my book there are only two mature and legend youtubers They never insults someone and always humbleZakir and BB are the most favorite youtubers of mine and they have deep knowledge

What a melody Only few  people has taste of music now

This song fits perfect on my story our relation of 2 years ends and now we are at the same college but ajnabis I want to share this song‚Äôs link to her but she‚Äôs too far now

Bb has been in relationship like forever how could he relate this song with so much convintion

Legends listening in 2023.
Had been my  favourite ever since the first time I came across this just two days after release,

Anyone in 2023???

lucky are the people who got loyal partners otherwise nowdays realtionships are just nothing

Bhai u r just amazing with that story line and music , always a fan of bb&#39;s music first then comedy 

These type of songs are suits on you

Master Piece 
Once i listened to this song for fun but now i am crying while listening to this because i now know how much it hurts when you love someone and they are yours but you know that they are never gonna be yours. Deep isn&#39;t it just read it again.

Sunkar aaye me meme of interview with Thugesh
start music- akhon onek raat by anupam roy

After chatting hours and hours after three months she blocked me and ghosted this song feels like just just mine situationYad aye to mil jaunga tujhko yhai aur na bhi aye to Smajhjaunha ki mujh me hu thi kami...

It&#39;s 3:00Am + this masterpiece song  + tears in eyes + goosebumps = best feeling in the world 

I have no words bhuvan

Nice one 
A sweetest memory might end in a painful song

Lyrics are wonderful

BB is so talented

Where has this PURE LOVE gone from today&#39;s society 

No big brother, I took the sun by mistake‚Ä¶ I have sinned.
This song is just like a hidden gem, I will preserve this.

I don&#39;t what to say sir. I just want to request to keep continue your you tube channel even when you become very big star. Although you are now to a big star..........

Starting guitar tone was copied from bangoli song Akhon onek raat....

I know you probably wouldn‚Äôt remember me, in 2016, I had texted you on Instagram! I asked you to sing ‚Äòkuch toh hai&#39; Song cover and you replied by saying &#39;sure will try&#39; I was a fan of your work back then and I am even now! Keep growingkeep glowing

Usual I don&#39;t say this much but this song is literally masterpiece

BB on Ô∏è
Brother, tell me the truth, I don't like such videos... Brother, your talent made me laugh every now and then. Your expensive
My favourite song of all time 

Only very deep person can write such lovely lyrics

Awesome 

Seriously how did I miss this song. Can&#39;t believe I am listening to it now.

Bro collab with anuv jain and make song like baarishe pls .

Even after chatting till 2 o'clock every night, I am still a stranger to him.
This song is still very close toy heart 

Wow mast song hai bhaiÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
This song is awesome  I am in love with the lyrics 

<a href="">01:20</a> Ô∏è
Brother what a voice 
this is the masterpiece of all the time !!! 

<a href="">3:56</a> I like this background heeeee

Guitar solo of this song is too underrated what a melodic solo .. trying to learn by ear.....used to listen this song repeatedly at the releasing time...bhuban ur composition is so awesome man....

Here after with BB &#39;s taza khabar interview with girl tonakshi kalra in this song between <a href="">0:07</a>-<a href="">0:10</a>

Kaun Kaun yeh video dekhne aaya he after watching abp live interview of bhuvan in 2023.

coming soon next Superstar
The Ô∏è heart touching line in middle make me feel to cry.

This song is not my favourite

I came to see the reporter.
Hamdardi Wale Hi Aksar Dard De Jate Hai It Hits Hard Now....

A.............

soooo cute

Who came after thougesh show with BB

I watch the video after watching thagesh show meme section

Wow bro bhuvan , too goood

This song should have been on TAZA KHAABAR last episode (fits well).

Nice song bhai
Here again after Taza khabar love you BhuvanÔ∏è
Bro i actually feel this song and then I say myself &quot;no love&quot;...but this song is really bro insane life it should get more popular...and bhuvan as always killed it 

Lost him to Qismat will meet again when the strings of society can no longer keep us apart. One day 

One of the best song ...full of emotions 

Itne the paas ham aur Ab ajnabee hogaye 

We live in a society‚Ä¶ where yalgaar is having much views than this masterpiece‚Ä¶ No hate to both artists but this deserve much attention

LOVE you Ô∏è bro and hate you  bro

What a concept!

Nothing against with Carry but i feel this song is better than Yalgaar. All time fav BB 

This song defines my current situation 

Bhuvan bam and apurva what a combination 

Another year.. my another comment here.

Your concept and your storyline was excellent  you are great artist  i am big fan of yours 

That last part. Take love from bangladesh üáßüá©

I heard it for the first time in the first year of college and now I am able to relate it.
Mast songa hai dill pe aagya
Yaad aaye toh mil hi jayunga tujhko yaheenNaa bhi aaye toh samajh jayunga thi mujhme kuch kaami Purest form of love where he does not even blame the girl for forgetting him.Rather he blames himself maybe he has some flaws...

There was a time when your relationship was meant to remain till heaven. But, now you two became ajnabees to each other and deep down that hurts.

This is the song every time I feel something that I can&#39;t explain but  it&#39;s 

Masterpiece with harsh reality

Its been 3+ years but my heart sinks everytime i listen to this song &lt;3

By listening this song, I&#39;m missing my ex boyfriend  who never existed 

Sorry bb but i really didn,t get the song 

Just broke up now and listning this masterpiece with tears in eyes

5 foot ka lagta tha lekin ye to lamba nikla talking about bhuvan

Listening in 2022 still it is refreshing and vibing song Great work Ô∏è‚Äç

How the fuck I didn&#39;t press the like button

The moment when the girl had to remove her accessories that made her look cool and vibrant (both at young and old age) They literally made us realize how a girl can be her true self only around her loved ones  Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è this made me smile and cry at the same time ;(

Osm song bhaiyaÔ∏è

Meaning is awesomeAmazing bb that is peace

<a href="">2:16</a>  .... Best

Two years ago, when this single was first released, I didn&#39;t understand what it meant. It was all so confusing and bizzare. The video made no sense at all. Today, I felt every damn second of it. Yaad aaye toh mil hi jaunga yahi.  &lt;3

Bhuvan is multi talented lovely song 

This man is a real legend bro! i just love him! Every thursday I eagerly wait for DHINDHORA!! Thank you BB for making us smile!

Bhuvan Bam ..has my whole heart for all his talent just love him for everything he is doing ...god bless him ...with more and more .....I just wish the best for you BB 

The story concept is marvelous.. beyond to our thinking 

;__; I love you man so much meaningful songs are really unseen nowadays

Now I am of the same color...
BB,,,, do it like this, whatever you want..only for yourself.only then it will look original and everyone will like it..thanks brother, it is a simple song to make everyone relate..bless you buddy.

After listen this song singles also felt that they have a girlfriend Ô∏è

So so nice thank you making this amazing video

Lovely
33k dislikes are from Tony Kakkar&#39;s Fan

Other youtubers ek side..bb is just on diff level

Arijit also released the version of this song Bhuvan sir!!
Trust me or not,BB believes in true love, but incomplete. Uska manna hai that true love is always left incomplete, and love is painful. True love does not fade away with passing time, but it is always adhura.Listen to the words carefully -- &quot;Humdardi wale hi aksar dard de jaate hai.&quot;&quot;Pyaar bawaseer ki tarah hota hai, ekbar hota hai lekin dard bahut deta hai&quot;.In Sang Hoon Tere at the end, Bhuvan dies and the girl recalls Bhuvan by watching their old recorded videos and those pics, behind which was written &#39;Sang Hoon Tere, now and forever&#39;.Love never dies. Just that stories are left incomplete, giving us pain.

Aanson aa gye 
I don&#39;t have a gf but after listening  this song I feel like life is short and enjoy ur fullest while u have time so i spendTime with my parents 

Very good  bro Ô∏è

Longs hairs in old age bhuvan bhai

Deepest condolences on the loss of your parents. I have kept this song on YouTube Repeater for the longest time. Yes, your multi persona one handed phone acts are cool, and they give people the light hearted bursts to get away from the daily bhasad. But music is where your talent shines through. You should really do more of this.

Ab kia bolu sab to sunlia 

bb lost his parents Ô∏èÔ∏è
GAJAB
you are the best artist everÔ∏è love from Pakistan

I miss my ex this song line hits different 

Bhai Bhuvan Bam I want you to sing, this is not good, but brother Bhuvan, I am seriously making you look very good.
Yaad aye toh ..mil hi jauga tujko yahi .na bhi aye toh ..smj jauga
Acha aloo mila ki nhi
What a Song!!!! Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
My best friend left me. I was so attached but it was so easy for her to say &#39;&#39;i dont care anymore&quot;.This is so relatable.

Beautiful.

Did you see subscribe is more than views 

One of the best song ... I have ever tune .. Ô∏è ..   BB you are a legend Ô∏è

Where will you meet or good alu?
The best song really bhai kuch Kami nahi thi

Wtf i just realized that the girl was apoorva arora

I don&#39;t know why this song has so less views

This song has a deep meaning 

I have goosebumps this song is so beautiful  the music video &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ô∏è

The story of two neighbours who loved each other in their youth but couldn&#39;t be together for some family reasons(typical Indian society). The girl ends up getting married to someone else. I am assuming the guy is still unmarried till this time as there is no relative who is living with him and there is some emptiness in his eyes which is also shown in the younger version also when he is missing her.The guy waits for her return she comes to his parental home, they recreate their loving moments everytime, try to live every second of it and at the end they both have to wake up from their dream world which is so painful for both of them and you can again see the emptiness in the eyes of the man who will again wait for those moments for which he lives, for which he has given his whole life.I have lost count of how many times I have watched this song. Bhuvan Bam, you are a true musician Ô∏è. This song is right up there in my top list of songs to listen. Specially the story which has been told so beautifully in just 3 minutes blows your mind. Keep making such music man. Lots of love Ô∏è

Can somebody please explain why tf is this so fn underrated?

Most sad and lovely song forever 

This guy can beat the whole music industry Ô∏è

This song is so lovely.
Bingo chips is best

Best bb song
He&#39;s lyrics are awesome

Who&#39;s here after Dhindora 1ep

You can never underestimate bhuvan&#39;s singing skills

Each Every line hits different when you relate this to your life Ô∏è

Its the best

i like the attitude of bb , giving credits to all of his fellow actors and then giving credit to himself , or else i have seen many stars , forgetting that it is not only them , but also the other actors who perform with them as well . But yeah , Dhindora is coming soon , i am very excited for that .

I&#39;m very curious about the story behind this

I don&#39;t think carryminati deserves more than him

Close to my heart  
He made me cry
Whatever I said to you made me feel so happy
What nice concept of showing love.

This was actually a good song written , composed and sung by BB Ô∏è

Is this Apoorva??

Legends are watching after 1 year 

What a song 

Yad aayien to meet hi junga yahi yahi na bhi jaunga to understand that there is no one in me

Love itÔ∏è

Love, when we meet someone, it fulfills us with all its might, but when we go away from someone, we become alone, but when we truly love, we keep praying for each other even after being away.

this song makes me feel cry don&#39;t know why.. But bhuvan Bhaiya you are better than all 

I get mirrors by Justin Timberlake vibes from this song. Such a masterpiece.

Bollywood should listen this masterpiece 

The song and the video both are superb.

How can a person be this perfect 

The girl name is Apoorva Arora !!!

In the flesh, we walk together with you, And now we have lost our love, And now we are strangers.. In the flesh, we walk with you, And now we are gone, This is our love, And now we are strangers, You have come to know of my love, How can such a love remain without you knowing the condition of my heart, Tukde It's like this wait is different, it's like this, I'm drowning in my thoughts, I'm drowning in my thoughts, I'm dividing everything, I'm breaking all the relationships, I'm going to meet you now, I'm going to leave you here, I'm also going to go to the society that's going to go to me, what I say to you, what I say to you. So gaye, so gayeItne paas hum aur ab ajnabee ho gayeDil se hoke aakhon haiWoh yeh shaamein, shaam haiKhali the jo haanToone pakade woh jam hainUbhhte sannatehi hi toKayi baatein hain baatein hainHumdardi wale hain oftenDard de jaate hainYaad aaye to meet hi jaunga tujhko yahinNa bhi aaye. To samajh jaungaThi mujhmein hi kuchh kami
Really heat touching songs

Hello

Bhuvan Bam, I love you so much &amp; ‚ÄãI am big fan of yours. I am from Nepal. I just love to watch you and your videos. I always search videos related to you. I  had watched your all videos. I loved them and all are very funny. I&#39;m always waiting for a new videos. you are a great singer, when i am alone your song is my frnd and you are  one of my fav singer from India.

 If possible, in future I want to meet &amp; interact with you . I am big fan of yours and love you so much.

While listening this song I asked my girl that, &quot;This won&#39;t happen with us right?&quot; and she promised, &quot;It won&#39;t happen DW&quot; and now she&#39;s asking for Breakup. We&#39;ve been together for 7 and half years. I can&#39;t give up on her. I can&#39;t become Ajnabee to her.

bhuvan&#39;s songs are the best but dont know why still underated,his songs is more valueable than Tony kakkar&#39;s entire carrier !

Finally I cried after so many months  thank you bb ... every line of this song means a lot to me Ô∏ètoo much relatable!

Bbs songs are lot better than all those shit rappers. He is so underrated

Bhai your song so groot 
Yaad aaye to meet hai tujhko jahin, na bhi aaye to understand me jhunjha hai . (Aug17/21)

Bhuvan is extremely multi-talented do you why ?Because he has a heart touching voice.Because he has skills of singingBecause he knows acting Because he know to bring smiles on our smile ..He is a gift  to us love you Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

Bhuvan bhai, the pain in your voice is so different, this is the top of our life, this song is true in my mind, but I have not been able to understand it, but your heart is also broken by someone else, it is like this, you have lost the most precious thing, it was in your heart. video 4 to 5 br dekh chukha hu par jitna br dekhta hu utni jda hai ati hai Apka liya sa dil sa salute sachhiii you are always special and stay strong aapka parents kya ni ni hai wo apka pass he hai maa baap kabhi akla apna bachho nii chodta Love uhh bhai
