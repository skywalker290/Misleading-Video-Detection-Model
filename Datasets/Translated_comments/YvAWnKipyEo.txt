Love you Kajal ❤❤
Love how kajol protects karan when the convo is directed towards a future &#39;Mrs Johar&#39; and just completely redirects it. Their bond is so special❤ Even today no matter how much these two have changed as people their friendship remains the same through and through.

Kajol upon Karan&#39;s marriage topic 😅😂😂

<a href="">21:59</a> years later that &#39;GUY&#39; became &quot;Gaai&quot;/ cow in Aap ki adaalat

Kajol is a comedy legend &lt;3

That <a href="">2:09</a>  just shut up was epic😂

<a href="">8:23</a> 😂😂

<a href="">8:23</a> 😂😂

<a href="">8:23</a> 😂😂

Did he shaved his chest hair according to the collar line? 😁

Why has their English/style of speaking deteriorated so much since then?

Kajol is the real life geet

I lived with her out of pity; she is one of the poorest gypsies in our country.
Karan Kajol best friend....❤❤❤
Gorgeous kajol 💟🔥
And that&#39;s how Karan Johar got the inspiration for his show &quot; KOFFEE  WITH  KARAN  &quot; ..........

Psycho Kajol!
Kajol sucha honest person, karan so sweet here. Industry or time changed karan

2023 any watching

They scream besties , loved watching this interview it was super enjoyable and funny , I’m a fan of simi ma’am interviews she just éludes such elegance

Which Manirathnam film was offered to her? Anybody knows?

I love Kajol to me she is the most beautiful, natural, honest and talented actress and human being there is and ever will be. I love everything about her. She is my Queen❤

Kajal was trying so hard to conceal the fact that Karan is gay 😂 and its funnier because Simi ji kept pushing the issue😛

I don’t really like kajol.. is always unnecessarily over enthusiastic as if she’s high or something and nothing she says makes sense!

What year was it?

Kajol is Anjali from K2H2

The way she talk in movies she lives her character

<a href="">23:18</a> prediction came trueee… I am so happy for him that he has little Johars ❤❤❤ that he always wanted ❤❤❤❤

Such genuine camaraderie. They&#39;ve all aged emotionally now

Karan sir is my all time favourite director

This is us, all of us before life happened

Karol has the heartiest of the laugh...pure...candid one

What a whining voice, calm down and try to speak like a lady, if you can.  Take lessons from  Nita Ambani kajol

They should have married 😂😂😂😂 lol

Simple days ....
no one can understand how i am a big fan of this friendship

its beautiful to see how she has not changed. she&#39;s just the same.

LOVE BOTH of themmmmm sooooooooooo muchhhhhh 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️❤️☮️☮️☮️☮️🌈🌈🌈🌈💚💚💚💚🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️👑👑👑👑
<a href="">23:08</a> She predicted...

Karan was real then. Now he just wants to fit in with the gay ( i&#39;m all for sexual preferences ) gang. Just over the top with fashion and pseudo snobbery.

Wow brother there is whitewashing going on in this comment section.
Incomparable Kajol, today&#39;s generation is Missing such purities, concerns, integrity and compatibility in the industry, the way Kajol hold the hearts of audience is amazing, Simi your efforts and homework is always inspiration, good luck Simi

2 brilliant cinematists

Those days actors dressed up in modesty ...no unnecessary exposure  of body ....tantrum

Aftr kanganas allegation, I saw Karan as a villan, but this interview changed my perspective. He has his own journey and struggle...we should never judge anyone ...

One more to add Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. I’ve watched this in 🇩🇪. Amitabh Bachchan was very strict and conservative. Jaya Bachchan stood beside Shah Rukh. Shah Rukh Khan I felt sorry for him. The way he was unkind to Hrithik Roshan when he visited them in London years later. Kajol she was hyper and a loving wife. I didn’t mean to say this but as always Kareena Kapoor she was conceited. It was an emotional 🎬. Karan Johar He’s indeed a good director. He did extremely well 👍🏾.

The only raw and real person in Bollywood is kajol

Kajol is really really annoying. I mean, there&#39;s being joyful and then there&#39;s her. Ugh.

I wish I had loving protective vivacious  friend like Kajol minus the volume

All time favourite kajol

Ajay Devgn be like= Ata majhi satakli

I like the old Karan

Actually little Johars ...without a wife ..its beautiful how his whole life is spoken clearly in this interview has happened exactly that way

Guy from Ghatkopar 😅

Who knew that buying a cheap version of such a show and doing it yourself will make you feel bad all year long.
But Why Ajay devgan not here

This the only interview of simmy where there’s so much noise, Kajal cut Karan so many times and shouting. Zero grace.

Kajol laughing at last is so beautiful 🥰🥰🥰🥰😘
Kajol I’ve watched her work in 🇩🇪. She’s indeed a good actress 👍🏾
Kajol is v ill mannered. There’s one thing to be unabashed and outspoken and yet another to be plain obnoxious. She tried to out him several times and that’s just not done as clearly Karan didn’t want to come out at the time. Whilst Kajol’s outspoken arrogance might seem welcome in an industry where people are guarded, she should realise as an adult how to conduct herself in different settings. But she’s successful hence moot point.

Karan with his underlying snooty vibes and snobbish attitude 😂 This episode is such a great precursor for how their personalities shaped in time

Translate it with at least subtitles
it would have been so good if karan never came into bollywood

The goal to launch every mediocre kid born in the fraternity has ruined your craft as a director Karan...you might be making money now but does that replace the love we had for your movies ????

Hain dosti bahumoolah gehnaVastra hain yeh smile Hain dosti sa alag pehchanBasti hain heart main aap
Such a handsome man cannot believe he is gay

One of the most overrated actors of ALL TIME… Kajol.., the ultimate hype for no reason

Well Kajol was right about surrogate motherhood!

Why couldn&#39;t Kajol  got married to Karan J. rather  than hanging around other people.  friendship is love. they say in their film.

Kajol is the realest of the realest no fake that&#39;s why everyone loves her and is drawn to her. She stays true to herself and doesn&#39;t give a shit about what people think of her that&#39;s something that most people are afraid to do. The friendship of Kajol, Karan &amp; SRK is that of pure love that most people want and wish for. Kajol&#39;s laugh at the end had me dying love her beautiful inside n out.

Hats off to that kind of friendship ❤️

Yes you both are a family Simi Garewal - Kajol &amp; Karan Johar very beautiful every time you are the most famous actress every time the most important thing is that love classic movies is very welcome on the planet the more you do classic the more you will have a lot won on the planet a lot ask yourself questions in return in every time i was next to indian very much i respected and i respect you
You must agree Simi Maam that this was the most non serious and hilarious episode you have ever hosted all thanks to Kajol.

Half expected Kajol to be like Anjali from k3G again. Her best role after DDLJ in my opinion

Kajol is funny when she says something genuine, it's not meant to be beautiful ❤❤❤❤👌
Wow kajol is really beautiful

Kajol keeps bloody interrupting… not to mention how loud she is…

&quot;&quot;IS SHE BETTER THAN AUDRY HEPBURN OR SRK NEAR ANY WHERE TO CL8NT EASTWOOD? THYE ARE 100 YERS BEHIND STILL CHASING GIRLS LIKE COLLEGE BOYS?

Superb actresses those days all have attractive Personalities

kajol brought tears into everyone&#39;s eye but tears of happiness♥

Did she say, “Get a GUY from Ghatkopar?!?”

I love Kajol, she is so pretty, Marion Cotillard looks a bit similar in the face :)

Kajol is so beautiful &lt;3

Now Karan is the brutal brat of Bollywood..  Who wants to be a god who can make people and destroy them too ..

Of all the interviews that I watched on this amazing show, this is the worst....normally I don&#39;t criticise but there was just no room for questions, only cutting each other short, PJs, weird comments on each other and awkward silences.....just didn&#39;t like it

hair on the chest used to be sexiness

He was good till in closet the way ge achieved things are remarkable its okk to be gay untill not harming the parents ..  The best is he holded relationship..  Kajol laugh is like disgusting

Ah! Back when Karan was classy and fabulous. How I wish he stayed this way.

Kajol’s age going reverse.. she looks more younger now ❤️

Karan might had got the idea of coffee with karan from this show …

Kajol says &#39;shut up&#39; too much. It sounds rude.

Over acting ki dukaan kajol
Why Kajal behaved so immature?

Kajal is still in the character of Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghum.. She has not come out of it..

They are literally brother and sister

Guy from Ghatkopar.

Shee 😏

Kajol when are U meeting me....believe me you will have no regrets....just adore U unconditionally....💞

When was this interview done?

When karan talked about his parents oofff that was so beautiful!!!

Is it weird that I find karan handsome here?

I’ve noticed that Kajol she’s hyper and active

Again I watched Kajol work in 🇩🇪. She’s well talented
What a superb interview with 2 of my favorites

A petition for interviewing SRK, Karan and Kajol ❤

A pure friendship 💛Kajol and Karan are friendship goals Karan isn&#39;t as bad as the world portrays him to be...it&#39;s all a part of life and growing up...

Kajol just does her best💃💃......no rat race,  no competition ❣❣❣sets a very high standard for herself by being her natural self 💌💌love watching this conversation 💗💗💗💗
Karan never called in Coffee with KaranCheappooo Karan👎

Oh karan how I wish you remained like this even today.Amen

I can empathize with Karan when he talks of Kajol and her warmth of her being with U as a friend...I relate to Kajol and go the extra mile for one and all....that&#39;s what friendship is all about ....a role model....a friend everyone needs❣🤝❣

This show name should be “Ek dusre ki Tareef”

Adorable friendship❤️Best episode …
So stupid time waste over acting 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 simi I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The scenarios they talk about are so unrelatable...

I am here after tiktok clips 😬😬😬
Kajol is a very nice and warm soul....it shows very clearly...no pretences....stay just the way you are 😘💃😘

Look how these people laugh about even the simplest things of Karan Johar and now if he&#39;s doing today anything wrong according to you it&#39;s his choice and I feel sad about him and much more sad about those people who make fun of his personality 🕉️

SACHH ME KARAN GAY Hi...KYAA???ANS ME..I DONT KNOW...SO I M ASKING.. OR ..ITS JUST  JOKING. OR .. REALITY....

Only boys do not...but only boys love each other &amp; RESPECT DETI HAI👍❤️ THAT IS OUR <b>*KAJOL</b> 🍫 SO NATURAL ACTRESS...DOWN 2 EARTH...NO OVER MAKE UP...NO.. 2 MUCH HAIRSTYLES..
Karan was hundred times better before then what he made out to himself now by following fashion and people

I love the way Kajol talks !🔥🔥❤️😄
Kajol was lil bit uncomfortable wid Karan...look at her she is so unstable in the show😂😂🤣🤣🥱

Kajol is loud, shrill and OTT pretending to not care ! I’ll informed and I don’t know why she was making fun of south stars so blatantly, like they are beneath her. She won’t be able to half act like even one of them. Her entitlement best stayed in her head !

At <a href="">6:10</a> she is

Kajol is looking so beautiful

I just love the end the way they laughed

Wherever she goes she makes it something  special , a bit funny a bit enjoyable and that&#39;s the speciality of my queen Kajol .

Too much she laughing.... hopelessly

I love  the way ajay says her name as kajal not kajol

omg karans hair thing looks so disgusting

What a lovely interview ❤️

Unconvincing. Both nepokids.

Who else noticed that kajol nudged karan for him not to talk about the mani ratham kuch kuch hota hai clash. She does that with sharukh too. So pure

What was the name of the maniratnam film which kajol did not do ?

Kajol is brilliant actor. You can&#39;t find better than her in Indian Cinema.

Friendship of KaranKajol💖💖💖💖
Ok one view of karan shows kajol is lying when she says she never thought karan is bad director 😂

Kajol is is very talented but highly artificial

Karan got success in very young age it is not easy

A brash, nasal and overrated actress clubbed with an effeminate showy director.....

Kajol is my fav forever and always mashallah a timeless beauty

SHAH RUKH KHAN ONCE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW:&quot;I WASN&#39;T SHAH RUKH KHAN WITHOUT KAJOL IN MY FILMS AND EVEN IN MY LIFE&quot;THAT IS SO TRUE ❤❤ SRKAJOL
KAJOL AND KARAN YOU ARE SO FUNNY. BUT I MISSED ALSO SHAH RUKH KHAN ❤❤❤ 😎✌NOTE: I LOVE THE ENGLISH KNOWLEDGE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL SIMI 👌👏
Kajol karan♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
How time change...

Simi was so gracious in inviting Karan twice on her show when he wasn’t still a powerful producer and he then goes on to encroach her area of work. Greed has no boundaries nowadays. Time for this show to make a come back.

Karan was so handsome and polite then. His depression changed him. If he could get married then, I swear, 90s top actresses would have been in a Q

Benchmark of male superstar = Shah Rukh Khan and Rajnikanth Benchmark of Female superstar = Shradha Kapoor and Sridevi Benchmark of boy-girl friendship = Karan johar and Kajol

And when I said I can’t love Simi jee enough.....the genuine laughter. Miscellaneous grin . Love..... I wish I was in know how in that insiders joke  giggle 😂

Calling this kind of senseless, overbuildup person to personal interview is dead waste..  utleast from next let Karan support new comers even if he&#39;s from small village

<a href="">14:18</a> 😍😍😍
Love you kajol... She is so cute so beatiful

Kajol sounds uncouth. Simi ma&#39;am, Zeenat Aman, Sushmita Sen all are so dignified in their manner of talking. Not my favorite rendezvous to watch! 👎

Kajol should learn to alloow others to talk. Other than that her energy is fab

mam I feel really bad for u..u were best..that cheap Karan johar..spoil ur show..aap Kisi Ka mazak bhi nhi banati thi Apne show me..please phir se start Kar dijiye aap apna show..

it was a good decision she went ahead with k2h2, dilse bombed at the box office anyways

She is over smart and showing attitude.

karan isn&#39;t the karan we see today, i feel bad for judging him, today&#39;s karan is just the result of the cruelty done in this industry

Karan the chhakka ,gay n manipulators in everything by everymean ..

Madam.. Ur Dress code is Just A Star... Namaskar

My Heartfelt Respect To Ur Elegancy. Smartness.. Namaskar
My entire childhood was dwelling in karana johar movies like k3G, kuch kuch , kal ho na ho and today when he and shah rukh are given so much hate I feel so badI doubt myself and its like my childhood is being taken away

Plzzzz one more time with...SrKajol &amp; karan plzzzz😭😭❤❤❤

She&#39;s so damn prettiest finnest honnest &amp; natural...she&#39;s only one...❤❤😍

How much noise does Kajol make?
Kajol is a pagal actress she is a bad women and karan johar is also a bad person

Why I&#39;m watching this now

He was a gay and kajol clearly knew that why she is laughing like hell

Watching Kajol speak is exhausting 🤒

Where is Ajay in your show dear

Karan Jahor's saari movie is crazy
Why haven’t Karan directed any gay movies?

Its irritating 😣😣😣...yukkk
A real life example of ayan and Alizeh in ADHM

Almost all pair in this show got parted

<a href="">22:03</a> Simi’s reaction says it all

Kajal is cute.

Take a look at Chakka.. Knorr gives soup to the boy at 3 o'clock in the night..
Here they are, the epitomes of Nepotism in front of epitome of grace, Simi.

Kajol has spoiled ms.Simi&#39;s aura, vociferous.must show some etiquettes.

I LOOOOOOOOOVE KAJOL. I mean, Madhuri, Aish and all other actresses of my time are so good but she&#39;s the ONLY one who has a lot of natural &quot;Eastern&quot; essence. Like no lightening or dying of hair to brown, or overplucking eyebrows (DDLG Mera Ghabon Mein Jo Aaye), anorexically thin like Victoria Secret models, doing demeaning brand deals with media moguls outside Bollywood (Priyanka Chopra Exotic) - she&#39;s retained that completely in attitude and looks whilst leaving an incomparable legacy in Bollywood (Shahjol 4evz). Hats off to her remaining true to her roots, not losing herself in such a tumultuous industry with huge exposure worldwide and risk of losing oneself (drinking, smoking, partying, drugs etc.) and still achieving success. Super secure and obviously not digestible to a lot.

Kajol play all roles..... Mesmirize.... In reality or on screen

Karan&#39;s chest hair🤮🤮🤮🤮
<a href="">6:18</a> the IRONY

Kajol is really sweetheart. i love her so much from my childhood..she is the only actress who is real... She is funny,loud,caring,sweet... Ajay devgan is really lucky i must say..

I am sorry to say this but I couldn’t take off my eyes from those fur underneath his top.

karan johar is handsome

please listen
We all need a friend like Kajol in our lives.

Srk, kajol and karan are the three amigos of B-town.

She is so gud to her friends but its sad she is rude to her junior costars

Kajol is a person u love and hate at the same time due to her honesty and bad attitude, 😑🤧🤧

ivf haha😂😂

Simi mam ur my inspiration...

Kajol&#39;s features want to run away from her

What A drama and lies karan

I think preferred this Karan. Not fake and dramatic like he is now

Kajol said to Karan  &quot;if you get a &#39;guy&#39; from Ghatkopar &quot; not a girl, so openly, back then!!! How come nobody is talking about that!

Karen johar was so good in his youth days

Nepotism

I had a hearty laughter with you all 🤣❣️

The story at <a href="">3:03</a>, I heard in kapil sharma Sir&#39;s show..I know muchh more later than this🤣🤣

How and why did she get so fair? She hasn’t looked brown since dilwale. Doesn’t make sense

Omg, at the marriage topic, Karan got bit conscious, and at the end when Kajol had this long chuckle she was about to spill the tea that karan can’t be married to a girl as he’s gay, and to not let that happen Karan said change the topic, the exact scene has happened to me, Omggg😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

karan&#39;s chest hair are trimmed according 😁 &quot;V&quot;  shape

Karan wasn&#39;t out yet at that time as gay?

Anyone reminded of friends? Monica and Joey in her new restaurant.

Karan is so handsome 😍

She don&#39;t have manner to talk she just actress that&#39;s what people like her

I notice that Kajol is wearing a simple maroon Salwar Kurta for this show. No over the top jewelry, no accessories. She looks beautiful n cool. Today actresses doll up even for attending Faridoon’s show or any silly Radio promotion. Why don’t today actresses be a little more real ? Why do we need designer clothes for every public appearance?

My most favourite interview love u kajol
Now the same guy hosts a show called cappi with Koran

Iove kajol she&#39;s my favourite actress and amisha Patel, shilpa shetty  and madhuri dixit. I love their ❤❤💕💋

Such a fake world.....

I don&#39;t understand. If SRK did Dil Se and KKHH then why couldn&#39;t Kajol do both🤔

OMG, how very lively! Kajol has been my favorite star.The best thing I like about these Rendezvous is Simmi, her small instant polite and infectious  reactions!   I am watching your shows during this lockdown period and it brings me back home!

Kajol n Simi ur my favorite

Oh god. Karan was telling the truth. He went for it 😊

Did she say guy from ghatkopar 😁😁😁😁 Kajal really made him out to national  tv .....

<a href="">21:00</a> how the conversation was taken lightly and fun and became reality

Back then everyone used to be so real.. No unnecessary make ups and simple dresses. 🥰😍

I hate this eunuch karan

True Friends always say true and some times predict true that&#39;s why they are called true kajol as a person or a true friend she also wanted karan to settle his life as a form of marriage but she realised that what a girl want from men like his husband Ajay a common but  normal person  but what karan ? and no one girl want today husband like karan so  kajol prediction was come true.... Life is really mystery.... No one can solve it  only supreme god

Karan is so intelligent and a good director also but the problem is that his body language his talking style today it  is called homosexuality means act both like men and women  it is really what? But a big problem sometimes.... For personal life or self respect kajol is gifted actress and today she is good wife a good mother a good friend and also  true, humble and good women  of India.........

They are great friends ....

Love you Simiji, you are a gr8 host

I hate hate hate karan Johar
Can't Believe Kajol Refused Mani Ratnam's “Dil Se” for doing Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 🤪
Watching this in 2020!!! Love them!!!

A person has to be nice. Married or single not a big deal. I feel Kajol cracked up because Simi was talking about his marriage and children and Kajol knew that ain&#39;t going to happen. And now after so many years it&#39;s true, he has little Johars to take his legacy forward. Good on you KJo!

Kaajol is touching her hair because she is so comfortable to be near Karan. What a wonderful friendship ! Love you both and Simi-ji loades !!!

Never. Not. I'll stop. They will admire it. Like this. Talented. Handsome guys
Iove to see them both, realness💯

Hhuh karan has soo much hairs in his chest which is coming up to neck also eww yakk

karan johar loves kajol.but after kajol married ajay...karan acted like he is gay.

Oh there’s going to be a little Johar but not a Mrs. Johar!! That’s so uncanny. I am glad we have this online.

Karan kajol friends forever😘😘
kajol is so loud! karan was always so well behaved and well put together

lol whats up with her constantly playing with her sleeve and constantly flipping her hair?

Who notice karan chest hair 😫😒😅😑

Moti bhais  kajol aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty aunty

This is like kuch kuch hotha hai  time

<a href="">14:17</a>

I laughed at the moment they smiled together on the intro part. I genuinely know that from that smile they just want to laugh so badly 😂😂😂

KaJo l
<a href="">23:39</a> 😂😂😂😂😂1😂😂😂😂😂

He was pretty nervous about the &#39;gay&#39; thing

Kareena wore the same dress like Kajol&#39;s in K3G

Karan is cute and handsome

i love u kajol mam 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
hahhahahahahahahah <a href="">#kajol</a> ki <a href="">#uncontrole</a> <a href="">#laugh</a>at the end hahahahahahahahhahah

Nobody—Noooobodyyyyy—Me: why so much hair on the chest karan 🤣

Kajol reads Mills Boon novels?!!!OHMYGOD I JUST FELL MORE IN LOVE WITH HER!

Kajol is looking so beautiful

Bad Manners  Kajal

She is so alive ❤️

KKHHDDLJKHNH KKKG ❤️
The chest hair really disturbs my eyes 😂😂

Omg Karans hair on the chestOmggg

Karan at <a href="">8:23</a>

Prettiest interviewer ever watched.. Later on she chops her hair.. Why!?

Love these two, they are fantastic to watch together!!!! ❤❤

I have watched this episode so many times..just for kajol...for wonderful actor and an honest person she is...and of course her launghter

Karan has not accepted his sexual preferences publically before coming to this show He should see this interview of his ....

he is so hairy 😂

simi madamji what a wonderful interview with so beautiful and so charming personalities kajol and karan johar the duo so lovely so lovely so resourceful laughter and laughter no comparison beautiful interview salute to simi madamji for conducting this memorable interview hazaaron saal jiyo

The most talkactive peole on the showHahaha..kajol &amp; karan

I hate both of them , they show so much tantrums all the time

Karan is 6 nos

Kajol is very proudy girl i dont kno y

Karan and Kajol make such great friends.. Was a feast to watch them both

Love u Kajol ur best
Hi kajol

Oh i would do anythin to fuck the sht out of this kajol i swear to my whatever i have

I think 🤔 Karan took Kajols Advice very seriously.... She said to him don&#39;t get married n also said that he can b a surrogate Mother... N that&#39;s what Karan did.. Can u guys believe... 😂😂😂

Karan is such a cute innocent guy ...also good looking... But unfortunately he&#39;s just not interested in girls... N finally he bcm surrogate SINGLE parents... 🤔🤔🤗🤗

Kajol was so real back then,so <a href="">herself.Now</a> she looks so fake in her newly lightened skin😔

She more poo than poo.

I feel that she hides a lot behind her laugh... I think hides her insecurity behind it .

She is one loudddd helll of a woman.. pretentious jealous arrogant.. very insecureee..jangli with no etiquette. blabbers too muchhh does not mean honestt or bubbly. chubby for sureee..damnn personality..always putting off

Why is Kajol behaving like a teenage girl ??? I don&#39;t find her real. Even Unable to Express her opinion clearly and distinctly. Always in a hurry to talk ,in her cinemas too. No difference. She is same both in reel and real life.Koron is there trying to make up everything. Leave her alone. She will  be fish out of water. She is either with Shahrukh or Koron and hey_ hey_ hey. So cheap !!!

She’s beautiful masha allah ❤️❤️😍
When was this interview filmed? Karan looks different here but Kajol looks ageless like she hasn&#39;t changed at all

I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s the camera but almost all the actresses had smooth brown skin and now they&#39;re all fairer some are even white. I mean I&#39;ve seen Priyanka Chopra, Rani Mukerji , Preity Zinta even Kareena Kapoor&#39;s interviews, and they kinda look different.

Simi ji didn&#39;t need to speak in this rendezvous

I am sorry Kajol, but losing a Mani Ratnam film for Karan Johar? Seriously? Nothing can be more stupid than that. Karan Johar has never made a good movie (box office success is not equal to a good movie) and Karan cannot be half as good as Mani Ratnam in the next 7 births.

Her voice is annoying , stop talking Kajol and trying to be cool. Karan - hairy guy who openly  insulted Arjun Kapoor by calling him a hairy guy. Only Simi was good here

It&#39;s not that she&#39;s a skin bleacher who lies about it, it&#39;s just that Kajol is an ill natured, nasty person who has effed over a lot of people. Now she&#39;s married to that Rss, hindu nationalist pimp ajay devgan and plays that card as well.

Please let the video interviews be in Spanish, thank you
Karan life was shattered by tis actress. He is such  a nice man

I&#39;m not even Indian but I fell in love with this beauty watching My Name is Khan

Coffe with simi garewal.... Wow Karen really has done...

Omg Karan chest hair😪
Love u guys
kajol uses &#39;passive aggressive&#39; wrongly in the interview.. it&#39;s not a positive thing to say about someone :P

I miss this kajol :)

I think Kajol burst the bubble by saying &quot; guy from ghatoghar&quot; meaning that Karan prefers guys instead lol. seriously nothing wrong with that... people make a big deal out of nothing.

After sridevi I admire kajol most
If karan was not gay everyone would have doubted their friendship.

Kajol havent changed till now

Kajol z beautiful love her indian looks

@madrasTalkies

I loved both Karan and Kajol here!! So genuine and real! 😘

Karan was handsome??

No hair removed  from forehead nd still confident in such messy look😈😈

High level chutiyapa

The actresses in those days had so much grace...

&#39;You don&#39;t have to compliment or compliment my line na&#39;..........😄😄😄😄😄😂😂😂😊😊😊😋😋
Surprisingly everything Kajol wished for Karan came true. God bless ur friendship

English bolo this is good but apni language ko b prefer kia kro Bollywood stars

22.49 ....😭
Something has changed kajol a little bit

😂😂😂😂😂

When i heard the news both your friendship broke i was in the kitchen i was very upset...but i indeed liked kajol taking her husband&#39;s side

Absolutely..kajol just got the right word...superficial nonsense

Such privilege... knowing everyone from childhood working in comfortable environment now when I look back I think it was really easy for kajol.. all said and done she is a good actor.. and lucky as well

Why are they talking about karan&#39;s wife .. dont they know that he is gay...

I really get irritated at people who don&#39;t listen and who let you speak For eg.Kajol

the laugh of kajol at <a href="">23:38</a> kills me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

The only natural actor left in Bollywood

Kajol already predicted back then that Karan will get a surrogate motherhood 😂

<a href="">23:09</a>  Kajol&#39;s words came true.

Kajol is tickled pink at the thought of Karan Johar with a girl, and it&#39;s all going over Simi Garewal&#39;s head, hahahaha! This was pretty funny to watch. :D

loved this one, truly excellent  !!

so cute karan.

Kajol is beautiful person

PLEASE parents all of the world: please separate activities between boys and girls during Young age.

Kajol has such thick Indian accent.

Well the surrogate mother thing came true.

Friends 4 Ever !

Was this show aired on 2012??

she has got amazing sense of humor and wit.

She was my favorite she is my favorite and she will be

Kajol s so <a href="">funny.love</a> her <a href="">interviews.so</a> honest genuine.she never ever behave like an actress star.

She&#39;s hot

Daant nae dhoya shayad karan
Omg there isn&#39;t one but two little johars

Kajol is really a sweet,caring and real person,I am feeling sad that their friendship does not last forever.

Karan Johar was cute thenBut time and life has made him feel and change

Kajol is one of the very attractive actress  of bollywood  ..specially at that time ..

Karan is looking so nice

Kajol predicted the future of Karan&#39;s kids

Kajol is a bisch

how did she become this white fair from frying pan dark?

What happened to all the love now?

Where karans chest jungle has vanished.?

Kajol’s words came true, surrogate father is what he is now!

<a href="">23:07</a> Kajol suggested it!!

Extremely irritating and annoying kajol is talking out of context all the time and not respecting the interviewer

How beautiful is this interview, I felt warmth,and a party vibe all around me.

kajol is wonderful person 😍😍😍😍
God Kajol is so arrogant. She said some awkward things about him. I&#39;m sure he confronted her after this.

She seems to have adhd..

Kajol is too beautiful

Kajol mom u r really gorgeous... love you mom

This is real Indian beauty

I love kajol so much. she is the only pure actor. I&#39;m really love her personality. so fun n rockierrr

What a lovely giggly interview...

Whole life I was searching for such type of friendship...

ajay devgn best husband hai... kajol best wife hai... aur they are best couple

Then how come shah rukh khan did mani ratnam film and karan film if kajol left maniratnam film for karans film! Wise decision anyway

Guy&#39;s please come back with some good movie.Srk+ Kajol+ Karan 😍

Karan has more hair on his chest then in my entire body

since my child hood days i just luv kajol she is so simple no attitude, no fakeness she stay so natural i just luv her

Anil kapoor’s got a competition ummhmm
OMG! The last comments on in-vitro-fertilization and surrogacy! The overshadowing!!! This is cool and creepy at the same time. His friends and family probably knew right from the beginning.

kajol beautiful

Your choice of words. Your diction , You must  be delicious karan.😗😗😘😘😍😚😙

They are really amazing. I always enjoy their interviews  shows. They are so funny and cute. I missed srk here. Kajol doesn&#39;t want karan to marry and he didn&#39;t marry anybody. That was really so funny and she called him karu. Their friendship is really amazing.  Love them and wish to see them as soon as possible.

I love u kajol.
Yes, he did have Yash and Roohi Johar to him but no Mrs. Johar. I miss Kajol and KJo being friends. P.S. : Omg! The chest hair. XD

and at last the words in the show wat she said about the karan johar life had become true in the deep

I loved kajol
losing dil se for kuch kuch hota hai, amazing decision kajol
Karan again looking too fake, this generation bought fake shows in business

So happy they are back together.😍😍

Karan looks great 👍🏻
I hope, one day, Karan Johar will have the courage to come out of the closet. It is sad to live a lie (even though everyone knows that Karan is gay). There&#39;s really nothing to hide. People are not going to be shocked when he comes out since we all know that he is gay!

cute friends... love them

the guy frm ghatkoper..lol...i stay in vikhroli😂

lol woah look at karans hairy chest and crooked teeth! lol changed so much now!

They r so sweet..feel so sorry that they end up their relation and it shouldnt haopened and should bounce back

OMG, Surrogate mother, it  did happen.

Kajol and Karan please please please come back together!!! I can&#39;t stand your separation!!!

Now their friendship is just a history

its call it as a natural rendezvous interview made it by kajol mam very  eloquent way 

kajol I love you......soo much

So sad to see this after their fight :(

Kajol is over reacting poor kajol

and now they have erased each other from their lives

I want to have a friend like Kajol please. Straight foward, NO hypocrite, funny, beautiful  talented, caring, a good friend... 👍

Kajol is so gorgeous!😍

Sridevi is fav of both Kajol and KJO not madhuri

Mine all time favorate sweet Kajol ,We Love you so much

see.. now.. This friendship has broken.. kajol is out of karan&#39;s life!! So sad..They both could have solve the issue without spoil their deep friendship.. 

@23.06-23.10 Prophetic Kajol!

<a href="">8:35</a> :(

Karan was in love with Kajol..he being gay it ws not physical although...but then she fell for Ajay and the rest the world knows. Karan have told Ae Dil hai mushkil was semi autobiographical so he had depicted much of his love story in it.

Catholic gown ! Lol!!!

two dirty people gossip queens where is their friendship now??!!!!!2 fake n loud (unnecessarily)people 

Its sad that their friendship no longer exist.... 🙁

Kajol, why the hell did you turn down Dil  tho Pagal Hai 1997, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam 1999, Kabhi Alvida na Kehna 2006, 3Idiots 2009 and Shakhti 2001.

I wonder what happens when they individually see the episode!

<b>sigh</b> for some reason, this video breaks my heart. Nothing lasts forever.

Karan is so sassyy. Throwin shade and shit LOL

he is never gonna marriedhe is gay NOW( 2017) everyone know tht....its his life m not jugging him, but feeling m sad for him...

kajol always so so energetic
How do you lower the tone of the show? Invite Kajol.

So sad this relationship has to be end..

I luvv kajol
is she natural or showing attitude?in my opinion she has got attitude.didn&#39;t look natural to me

One of the sad truths of life is that nothing lasts forever, neither friendship, nor love.

She&#39;s too annoying don&#39;t like the way she&#39;s speaking.

i think kajol has adhd. she constantly fidgets wit her clothes...jewellery and hair. its very very distracting

Kajol at 14.17! 😂😂😂
So natural kajol

very nice

I love Kajol&#39;s movie but in this interview she is so annoying. She is talking too much and keep interfering Karan&#39;s talk. I hope she is not that annoying in her life with Ajay Devagan

kajol....love u

Is it Kajol and Karan Johar are no more friend?

kajol is kind of annoying here...seems fake

Kajol 💖💖💖
law u kajol
Kajol is so natural....I love her so much....

they could have gotten married

Now I got it when Shahrukh &amp; Kajol talked about Simi in Koffee with Karan, LOL!

It feels good to see that they are from Hindi film industries, borne,  brought-up,  lving and working in  Hidustan and did not use a single Hindi sentence or even a word in the whole interview.Hopefully, very soooooooon, we Hindustanis would &quot; transform &quot; ourselves into the Angrez-ki-aulaad  [ najaez ].

Love BOTH OF THEM

kojal beauty queen
God Karan Johar is so UGLY but he think he mr univers the way he walks on Ramp or fashion Show.

I LOVE KAJOL AND KARAN SO MUCH!! Their friendship is just the most beautiful thing on this planet! It&#39;s adorable the way Kajol looks at Karan whenever he speaks about something he is passionate about. You can just tell how much love they have for eachother and I hope their friendship stays that way forever❤️

She&#39;s so funny n free humor 💖 her

only actress who never cared about the damn what people would perceive through her is kajol...she&#39;s damn just kajol!!! no fakeness

Love Kajol in Europe. She is so real and honest. And an amazing actress.

Oh God i jusst love kajol
kajol&#39;s interviews r so much fun, luv the fact that she keeps real. i luv her so much she&#39;s my favorite actress since i first saw her in dushman,

Kajol and Karan are just so absolutely amazing to watch together, they have such warmth towards each other.

A lot of jealous here ...

Hehehe.......WHYYYYYYY kajol??? your DUSKY (Black) indian color was excellent but if thats what you want, good luck.

This is apparently K3G times, but she looked lot older in the film.. And in this video she looks like her DDLJ days

Madhuri is the best

Lol, I love you Kajol, you have me cracking up here, l0l!

She doesn&#39;t look beautiful.. great actress though.

Oh my goodness Kajol is such a big chatterbox. I would love to have a friend like Kajol. She is so sweet and caring. She has always been a fantastic actress ! I&#39;ve enjoyed her movies since i was a teenager. It&#39;s sad not to see her acting anymore but I&#39;m glad that she&#39;s being a good mom looking after her children. Another great interview Simi. Well done !

Faves

I looooooooooove Kajol...

Kajol and Karan is good together just the best?

Such a fun episode! So great
i can see kajol is very cheerful n easy to get along with.....really want to see u&#39;r next film with Sharukh khan

This episode is hilarious love it

Very true ajay and kajol complete each other in their personality differances

OMG! He was so right. He did sit across Simi Garewal after 10 years, completely single.

she is one of the only stars of this &amp; later generation&#39;s who is NOT insecure...she is who she is and doesn&#39;t hide herself because of what people &amp; the media will think of her....gr8 personality!!!

What a pleasure it was to See Kajol and Karan together. I only wish I had a female friend like Kajol, who is open honest and laughing at little things. They have been friends for so long because they cherish and compliment each other.  Simi looks so beautiful and classy. After all those years she is as beautiful as remember her from her movies  

Kajol is arrogant.I dont iike character.

that was 2001

early 00&#39;s *cuz this is after Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham was filmed, so this is most likely early 2001*

I love Kajol - she is making me laugh hysterically

I just love Karan so much



Oh my god. The opening sequence is pure cheese!!

Wonderful chemistry by both onscreen and offscreen.

How old is Kajol there?

Poor Karan :( Kajol can&#39;t stop laughing because of the white noise he&#39;s making to get away :) Love them &lt;3 

I know. 

FO.

I love Kajoll! :)
OMG, this woman is seriously annoying. 

I asked Kajol &amp; she told me that! :)

when was this

WAS NOT expecting the song at the start, omg.



by any chance is karan johar gay ?

Kajol thinks her chirpiness and bold attitude is lovable. But sorry, it&#39;s really annoying



how do u know she&#39;s talking about a pandit?



I know.. But that&#39;s not what Kajol intended to do. Lol But I&#39;m sure we all know Karan&#39;s sexual orientation, he&#39;s the only one that doesn&#39;t know. HAHA 

i guess he was right. 10 years down the line and he is still not married. yeah, and what was that about a &quot;guy&quot; from ghatkopar? it just didn&#39;t make any sense. 

Hmm maybe. Karan looked very awkward when Kajol said that. Even Simi picked on it. 

Lol, No she&#39;s saying for him to get a pandit (the guy) from that place to look for a girl to marry him. Hahaha!! I don&#39;t think Kajol would out him, that&#39;s something she&#39;ll leave as a choice to him to make himself. :)

yukh look at 04:46 something seems to be sticking out from Karen&#39;s nice.

Kajol&#39;s laughing is so stupid and the way she talks like have no education and look at her dressing and screaming and why is she keep on playing with her sleeves so annoying!

This show is so gay &amp; cringe worthy! But Kajol made me laugh

Karan is such a gay!!

Kajol is annoying, she needs to learn to behave better in public

Because the program “Maswina Asbet” is shown on the Star World channel
This channel is considered international and is all English
kajol there IS NO ONE comparable to you!!! u&#39;re the best. &lt;3

her programme is good , she is well spoken but this opening song drive me nuts.

i think kajol knows something ahahhaha

when is this from, they look so young?

Love kajol. So true right from heart. Her n Ajay both are good non pretentious down to earth people.

Karan looks the PRETTIEST of the three!

Did Kajol out Karan Johar at 21:56 ? What did she mean by that? If you get a guy from.....  

I just LOVE them!! Kajol...u r so beautiful! u have a brilliance smile... OMG!!!

Kajol is stunning and beautiful as always......
love kajol and karan ! they&#39;re soo funny together :D
