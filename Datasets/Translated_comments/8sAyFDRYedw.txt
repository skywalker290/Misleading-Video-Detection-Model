Hey self obsessed woman how about you google Kashmir lockdown and appreciate their struggle

Parineeti, you are very beautiful. Very beautiful than Priyanka Chopra. Any ugly girl can get facial surgeries and get beautiful (Priyanka). You are beautiful and a great <a href="">actress.Love</a> you 😘

Wish she has this conversation with Sushant

Pari I loved your initial movies, I&#39;m sorry your last few movies did not work out but now I understood more about the choices of those films. You are actually a good actress and I look forward to your upcoming projects. You have in another interview spoke about being in a dark place and how you overcame this, really happy to see how aware you are of your surroundings. Keep on smiling and all the best for your future movies ❤

The interviewer doesn&#39;t seem interested in her responses. Should work on his non verbal communication.

Good actresses but bad choices

She is superb...talented at the same time happy ND soooo positive ...ur successful as a human being

I am one of your most admirers of the Arabs by identifying Algeria 🇩🇿 I love you pariiiii 💕

Kashmir m to log pehla se hi lockdown tha

For some reason I find Jitesh Pillai very annoying. Especially after his comments on Kangana, Hina Khan&#39;s Cannes redcarpet and his constant interference with Filmfare awards (he literally destroyed the beauty of entire award ceremony).

<a href="">7:50</a> &quot;What have I spent my life doing&quot;.... !!! Pari u amaze me all the time...u hold the best philosophies and theories in life..No ambiguity, u are well read and u are very academic.. I am not a fan...but u are my pathbearer.. An inspiration always..I embibe a lot from u..

<a href="">7:40</a> That&#39;s the way a person should be balancing life..She&#39;s so damn correct...A stereotypical way of living is a baggage in its own way... Everything cannot be calculated or articulated...Some decisions should be arbitrary..I stand by each n every single principle and philosophy that u maintain in life....I find myself in u everytime I get to knw u more..U rock always

My pari my constant.. 😘☺️
I need Shraddha Kapoor
