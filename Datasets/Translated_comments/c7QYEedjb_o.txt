Sarcasm with actual Knowledge. You are genius 👏

Why are these people laughing when he says mai notes banata tha katai chutiya ho kya bhai

This never gets old 😹

But the last line is a fact but when he says hamara chuthiya cut raha tha it makes it funny

Why the fuck is he looking older than now😂

This was classic Abhishek style , miss it .. he also had his natural way of talking which is unlike that of now...

One of us is an actor living in a rich society.

He tends to smile at his lovely jokes at times. That he must not do.  Generally though he maintains a serious face. That makes his humour powerful , very powerful, top bracket.

Crime petrol I also started watching..it seemed as if Shaq was hot on this man…your mother, father, brother, sister, neighbors and friends all have a look on Shaq.. then what did they do at home and get the band made. .then my focus was on Godly media..debate, hatred etc. then what is the harm of hating someone especially on people of other religion..then it started hurting at home..there is no benefit in changing news channel..so watching news. hi band kar diya..ab free hai..comedy aur science etc dekhti hai..hi ho rhe entertainment se source of entertainment..free wala udhaar fikr band

Only time jab ye show mai naha k aaya

There is a shaoting in the wake of fool

very underappreciated bit between <a href="">12:45</a> and <a href="">12:55</a> (Abhishek gives there a very rare laugh himself). so smooth plug. such connections between larger stories make your stand up an all out riot

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I also live in the world❤

Saamne waala : Tumhari nani mus🅰️lam@n thi kya?

who agrees that Ye banda bhot funny hai ??

I did not understand one thing...in ur lady video where u spoke abt sadhguru and his theory of not eating non-veg..y the hell u turned off the comments section? If u felt u were rite or u reached a certain level where u can comment on sadhguru and his  theory ..then y the hell u turned off the comments section? Dude before doing stand up, first see and check urself on wat u r talking about....even if take 1000 incarnations ,then also u can&#39;t match or understand Sadhguru....so better stop bullshiting .... concentrate how to do stand up rather just making fun of every thing existing....this is not less than fullish ness...god bless u dude...

Congratulations bro you have the most viewed on stand up comedy on this show ♥️

Thank God you left your previous job. We got the best standup comedian ever. Have watched this multiple times and more times to go.

Abhishek upmanyu toh rehna do again
This look looks better than the current curly look bro.
This stand-up comedy video was really funny, with perfectly timed jokes and hilarious charisma. One of the highlights was a parody of a scene from Crime Patrol that managed to keep the serious tone of the original show while adding a funny twist. It was impressive to see the comedian turn everyday situations into side-splitting punchlines. Overall, this video was a comedic masterpiece and I&#39;ll definitely be sharing it with my friends!
