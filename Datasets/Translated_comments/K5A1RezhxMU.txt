Ending part was so emotional People say that we drink to forget the sorrows, why do we forget the copper? After drinking, the world gets to see a spectacle… I agree that sometimes we go out with friends, but what about the one who sits at home and cares about you? Grows up in fear...it could be mother, father, wife, sister, brother, everyone is your own, think if something happens to them after drinking, what will happen to them? They will think that this is a dream... You are drinking alcohol every day to forget some sorrow? No sir, you are burning your people in the fire of fear by drinking alcohol every day... Alcohol is not a solution. It is not necessary to drink alcohol to forget something or to celebrate something, it is important to be with your loved ones, try sharing your sorrows and happiness with your loved ones, the sorrow will reduce and happiness will increase...

OP video

<a href="">1:36</a> best scene ever
This video shows the real event on how someone/people get drunk but the most important scene was it  teaches us of being a responsible drinker. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you drink. The point is&quot;DO NOT DRIVE WHENEVER YOU&#39;RE DRUNK&quot;<b>Think of what you would lose by driving DRUNK</b>&quot;Don&#39;t ever attempt to drive drunk because you may get hurt of yourself.Lose your life or OTHERS (s/he might be the breadwinner of the family/brother/father/mother/sister,etc).You have to think for your family whose waiting for you to come home just like others! So,When you love yourself and your family<a href="">#BE</a> A RESPONSIBLE DRINKER FOR YOU AND FOR THEM(including other people)

Super

Aww, you are like this, you don't drink any alcohol.
🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅notheis

For your kind information approximately every transport business linked truck driver in india don&#39;t sleep in nights because have to give three night shift in a week minimum. They drink everytime. Because yeh coffee pike raat ko jagna bachkani baatein hai. Agar aap drink nahi karoge to hafte me tin din whole night driving karna 102 % impossible hai. So without drinking they can&#39;t drive. It&#39;s not about drinking. It&#39;s all about your control on yourself. Agar sahan nahi kar sakte to piyo mat.🥰🥰🥰

I&#39;m proud of you Ashu🥰❤🇮🇳💯💪

White boy parties very much!! These are our best ones, from the light, here!!! The party boys!! Very grand looking, indeed, I miss you, and wish I was there to party!! It looks like a good party too, with tons of fun!! Thank you, that was nice, to keep whitie&#39;s spirit up!! Thank you!!! So I just had a RUN IN WITH THE LUCK HERE!!!! HA HA HA HA!! I screwed off a bottle of wine, and the cap broke, so I replaced it with another cap, which was brown, not dark blue, as the original one!! So the combination, dark blue, and brown, didn&#39;t match, in the energy fore, and all the alcohol attacks broke off, and comes down now!! So we&#39;re allowed to party in 15 minutes, and can find our mate then, that we love, and want to shagg too!! Wow, that&#39;s good!! I like it here!! We have a terrible day here today, they tried to attack me, from the USA, but it didn&#39;t take on!! She&#39;s very upset, as it would have destroyed my summer!! Completely too!! But they invested all of their attacks, when I was out walking, to make them stronger on me, but they lost, and I got to go free then, and all of the attacks from the USA came off, on everyone!!! Hi hi hi hi, I&#39;m SO GOOD!! Wow, this is so good!!! So they can&#39;t beat me down, and I love me then, and you do too, what it looks like!! Wow, super sweet!! So all the alcohol attacks, and all of the United States attacks, on about being a good person, but a drunkard around!! I think they drink much over there, what do you think??? So all the attacks came off, in regards to alcohol, and is off in a matter of 10 minutes!! And all of the picket fence attacks, on doing the right thing, from the USA, is off in around about 8 hours!!!! IIIIiiiiii, I&#39;m, so good here, I should invest in it!!! Wow, what a miracle, I love it!!! Thank you lord, God, and Jesus not, as it&#39;s over with Jesus then, that takes the stage, as right and true, from the view point of the United States!!! Wow, this is GREAT!!! So now I&#39;ve had a glass of wine, because it&#39;s summer, and we drink much then, even in prison ships, don&#39;t we???!! I love you, see ya!!! Have a good time, and party much, in whitie&#39;s spirit, not in darkie&#39;s spirit, where you don&#39;t get to be anyone at all, EVER, what a shame!!! I&#39;m saying, what a shame!!! I like my Evil friend here, and he likes me too, the one who sends me on missions, as a security officer!! But the rest, I don&#39;t know so much, but they might be ok??!! You all need to play without us now, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine, as you all don&#39;t know that we&#39;re around very much anyways, in all the different ways, do you???!! I hope you&#39;re fine!! Thanks for all the nice happenings, and all the experiments on me, they were FUN!! Thank you!! See you later, I hope you&#39;ll be all right!!! Thank you!! // J
