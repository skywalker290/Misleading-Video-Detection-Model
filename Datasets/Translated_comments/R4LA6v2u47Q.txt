Akhir me afsane hi reh jate hai... Aur unke kirdar



Another master piece from Nawajudin siddiquie

Thank You Nandita G and Nawaz Bhai for this masterpiece.We owe you. I&#39;m from Pakistan &amp; Manto&#39;s one of my favorite writers. His fiction introduced Urdu to International readers but I think his Essays i.e Non-Fiction is even better.

waiting

ooohh manto is my nick name it is kept from the name mantasha

Sahadat Ali kha (Manto)

as compared to the pakistani trailer, it is nothing...

Akhir m afsa hi rhh jate hh....or unke kirdar️

I watched ad of teaser of manto just before this video. Lol

Jaun Elia k barày me ha ye film

i hope they show the meetings of pak tea house where manto, faiz ahmed faiz, ahmed nadeem qasmi, ahmed faraz would gather and discuss on topics, it would be great

Pakistan has already made a movie on manto and that too on the same time period (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) and after I saw the trailer of this Indian made (manto) it is totally the same as Pakistani&#39;s so what was the need to make it I just don&#39;t get it !!!

Am glad we have a gem like him in bollywood .

Indians are indeed master copy cats, congratulations on releasing another version of &quot;Manto&quot;, when will you guys make something original? always copying Pakistan.

Kya tod actor hai bhai

Bal thackeray n monto. Both ka Madar chodo trailer may release date nahi bataya laudo kaun bolega release kab hogi?? Muje yeu film jald se jald dekhna hai...

Haha , Pakistan have already made a film on manto, copycat India, first they copy Actor in law in meter gul shit

Inspired by Famous International Awardee Marathi movie Court ?

Wtf. Now your chapa production. Copy full movie 

Pehle toh song copy karte they tum log ab toh lolly wood ki puri movie he copy kar lee ️ jiss ko yaqeen nhi meri baat pe toh youtube pe search kar lo

Acting mean Nawazuddin 

Piece of shit

i will surely watch it in theatre

“jab ghulam the tab azadi ka kwuabb dekhte thee.. aur ABB aazad hue tab kaunsa kwuabb dekhenge &quot; . Literally yaar  hats off.. 

When is this coming out?

Nawaz should do such roles oftenly. He should use his calibre, voice, gestures in the right direction.By the way what is releasing date of this movie?

Wow .

Copy of pakistani movie  lol

Aik aharabi jisay log ghr chor k jayay they...use hero bna diya...mtlb kuch bhi????

perfect actor for the role

Yar plz Pakistani theatres me usi  zaroor lagao.maa chodo is shitty politics ka

Aakhir me afsaane hi reh jaate hain. Aur unke kirdaar...

I&#39;m here again after hearing so many short stories written by Saadat Hasan Manto on the radio mirchi channel, and they narrated them so beautifully, I have watched this trailer before too, but now I&#39;m so hell curios about this guy, he has wrote such beautiful short stories that can make anyone fall for Urdu and Hindi literary works.....

Bala saheb thakre ki yaad dila di iss trailor ne .

I am big fan of shahadat hasan manto.!!Kab aane wale hai movie

I WILL SEE HIS MOVIES   He always do varsitile  roles  not  only one thing like SRK LOVE  LOVE  n  LOVE

Nawazudin kisi bhi movie mein ho.... Movie ko chaar chand lag jate hain!!!

Writer role in Nawazuddin...

a legend playing a role of another legend...... both nawaz amd manto are my favourite

Ya dislike wale hi race 3 dekhne gai jai

Thackeray was nothing but a goddamn goon. They still are.

manto is gonna be tight slap on those who press media by their power who is agree with me

World class ..waiting for the movie

The vintage effects in this movie is on another level

Nawaz Sir ke Wajah se Bohot famous hoegi

Aakhir me afsaane hee rah jaate hain 

Osm

I&#39;m so excited this film

Nawaz Bhai k Liye Like Thoko

Manto.. the best partition writer... Hats off for etching him on the celluloid!! 

Film to dekhoge ,lekin manto padna usse bhahot Jada achha rahega.lekin books ajkal log kaha padte hain.

Love to see nawaz in a different role .

Next Superstar of Bollywood   Sir Navazuddin Siddiqui

Another epic  i realy salute this actor who is taking bollywood to another level  actors like salman are realy piece of shit in front of him

Copy of Pakistani Movie..Already made in pakistan with same name &quot;Manto&quot;

I never watch movies in theatres, in fact had not seen a movie in a theatre for almost 5-6 years, but will go for this one.

Nawazuddin bhai is really a masterpiece kind of actor .. Hat&#39;s off...

Manto is such a great writer.

Asslamuwalaikum Sadath hasan manto. i read your novel.

&quot;typing ke shor se mere khyalat ki titliyaan udh jaati hain&quot;- simply mind blowing!

Manto, don&#39;t make us wait anymore

Bollywood is changing and we are lucky we are seeing that unfold. This is going to be a critical success, can&#39;t say anything about a commercial success 

बेसब्री से इंतजार है मण्टो का...

where i can watch this movie?

Ek second Nawaz uddin saadat Hasan manto pr biopic bna rhe... Now this news hai made my day I have heard all the stories of saadat Hasan manto from radio Mirchi they r fab

Akhir me afsane hi reh jate hai aur unke kirdar

I love nawbab .who one is watching this plz watct this movie on fit day first show plzzzzzz.He is a true actor .so gyes plz respect him.....

kb releas hogi movi??

This is how Bollywood should be. After dancing and dallying all they want under glittery lights, I wish creators settle down with such class acts.

I really loved his story &#39;Kaali Salwar&#39;

Bapre..kya acting hai bhaisahab ki..kudos!!!

Nawazuddin is one of the best  we hav... but yes ppl shud watch &quot;Manto&quot; the pakistani drama.. m sure u guyss will love it and the lead actor sarmad khoosat is awssome..

these movies and actors deserve oscar but andhii janta luvs race3 

Shandar ,jabrdast ,zindabad

Should have chosen manoj bajpai... Nawazuddin, although an amazing actor doesn&#39;t someone how fits in.  His Urdu is also not great

is movie ko to Oscar milna chaiye

Kab aa rahi yea moves

Mai ne manto ko padha hai....Aur mai ye keh sakta hun k uss waqt ki unki likhi tamaam baatein jaise bilkul aaj hi ki lagti hain...

is this remake of pakistani drama manto ?

What is the release date of this movie?

When is the release date.. Dying to watch it

Nawazuddin abb overrated ho raha hai qki ye harr jagah ek he jaisi acting karne laga hai.... Harr jagah ek jaise bolega waise he hasega.... Mtlb yarr jrroori nahi ki harr ghatiya shaqal wala insaan accha actor ho hee....,,

Eagerly waiting for this movie but it&#39;s my request to directors that please make movies on all the stories on manto

Ye banda sab difficult subjects mein aa raha hai Superhit nawaz bhai2Biopics:Thackeray and Manto

Best one Nandita Mam

Zindabaad zindabaad nawazuddin tera talent zindabaad

Had kuch acting nawwaaz sir

Love ti...just love it. When a man like nawaz takes on a character,  may it be Manto or Bal Thakaray. The politics all dissolves away and all that is left is a man and his story.

Will only watch it for Nawaz bhai. Great fan of yours!

Kab kab kaaaaaab release hogi yaar

Who the fucking 701

Lit

The role of Sadat Hasan Manto by &quot;Sarmad Sultan Khoosat&quot; in his self produced movie &quot;Manto&quot; is not just remarkable but outstanding. I&#39;m aware Nawazuddin Siddiqui, since Naseerudin shah is not selected acted at his best and performed the depiction of Sadat hasant manto very well as can be seen in this teaser. but again, I&#39;m pretty sure even before watching this Manto movie by Nandita Das, that Nawaz can&#39;t second Sarmad Sultan Khoosat. hats off to his brilliance performance. when I watched his movie. I was feeling as I&#39;m myself living in 40&#39;s with Manto. :)

Mene read kiya h manto ko 2012 me

Nawaz Bhai hattsoff

arey shandar zabardast zindabad

nawazuddin playing as saadat hassan manto..... aur kitna weight daaloge yaar???

First time saw this person really doing some good acting otherwise only his pr was shouting from roof top that he is good actor but he was always pathetic and repetitive.. Der Aaye durust aye.. good for him...

Omg....great actors....great biography.... Great...great.....race 3 is bhanggar

Im feeling awesome our Parallel cinema returns in Big Bang

Very nice teaser, Nawaz is the best

Wow , manto is among my favourite writer , and nawazuddin siddique how effortlessly wears the skin of manto.

awesome

Kaisi lagi script wala Banda to Humpty Sharma ki dhulniya aur aur Badrinath ki Dhulniya mein Varun ka dost tha na

Looking forward to this one.. love Rasika Duggal&#39;s work 

Brilliant!!!!!!!!

very Ray.

Came here for Zakir Husain and Sneha khanwalkar..

Manto, born in Samrala, Ludhiana and died in Lahore, yet no reference of Punjabiyat anywhere in trailer. Big shame!

Release date...???

Nandita ji superb

My... Loveble writer... 

Manto teaser far greater than race 3 trailer.Only original movie lovers like these critically acclaimed movies.

Manto ki kahani kya baat hai.. unke  afasano ke diwane hai Lakho, uniko Nawaz Bhai ke rool Mai dekho.

food for soul !!!

superb

&quot;...aakhir me afsaane hi reh jate h&quot; wow! Manto &amp; bioscopewala, two toppers in list, just flushed race 3! :p

Race 3 k tati trailer pr ja kr kro dislike

Yeh dislike kon chutia kr ra h

Aakhir me afsane hi reh jaate hain aur unke kirdaar

The most awaited film of my life yet....This teaser adds more and more impatience to that already impatient wait each time I&#39;m watching it.....Just congrats to Nandita ma&#39;am that she decided to make a film on Manto....And there&#39;s nothing to say about Nawaz sir....

Another Masterpiece on the way

Worth watching

Now this is a movie I can enjoy.

First day first show

hit like if you want to watch this movie in theatre instead of wasting money on race 3

623 those guys who liked Race 3 trailer.. lolz

Ritwik ghatak biopic

Most finest actor in India

Ten rupees and mozelle ( translated versions )were the first two short stories of Mango that  read , they weren&#39;t in any way close to whatever  I had read before !, wish I had the ability to read and enjoy Urdu...he could have been truly celebrated if he were alive today ... Manto , Guru Dutt were true artists . Wish nawaz makes a biopic on Guru Dutt

Nawaz Bhai u make acting look so simple it feels like we are just watching normal days of a person&#39;s life.. Hats off Sir for mesmerising us again nd again nd again..nd so on.............

Are yaar nawaz Bhai ko q liya...ab ye movie 100 cr nahi kamaayrgi...Salman ko Lena chahiye tha

<b>शानदार - जानदार</b>

My type of movie after a long wait

We Indians never appreciate these great movies....Shame

All praise to Nawaz mind-blowing choice of movie selection or we can say the other way round that he only can play Saadat Hasan Manto on screen. kudos to casting director.

flop

Manto phela lekhak tha jisne likh n ki azadi mangi thi

Best actor in the world

88 secs of teaser is better cinema than all 2 hours movie of all three Khan&#39;s combine idc

Bhagwan ko MANTO!

Better than race 

dil jeet liya yaar nawaz bhai ne. kya actor hain wo...main to jaroor dekhunga ye...aur kaun kaun?

Brilliant! Looking forward to watching this! ️

Amitabh ji k baad shayad Nawaz bhai hi hai sabse versatile actor.

Over 500+ dislikes!?  Man oh man. India will never progress

Always good acting from Nawaz .....

NDS rocks 

<b>Wow</b>

Woww very nice

Another strong movie on society by a Bengali director.

Ek toh manto boss k upar kahani ,Upar se nawaj , Bs itna hi Kafi hai

Thanks Viacom 18 for producing this brilliant film.

best hai yarr....

i always find nwaazuddin..an actor who is dark and funny...i cant project him as a writer in my mind....not impressive...

Superb

Natural actor !!

Brilliant upcomming movie of nawaz bhai...... Jab gulam the to azaadi ka khwaab dekhte the ab azaad hain to kiska khwaab dekhen........



Superb

Communist thoughts expressed when drunk. This was Manto. He wrote senseless essays just to create cheap publicity in those days. He himself was not at all liberal as he shifted to Pakistan after partition. All communist people though of making movie on this communist.

One more good movie which will be critically acclaimed, win awards but wint be a hit coz we don&#39;t like sensible cinema. Right? Sad but true .

Wow... 

Just to sayWoww

Wow.. looks amazing. Very creative and thrilling.. after all it&#39;s a period drama... and all depending on Nandita das madam.. 

Man to Nawaz- Aajkal aap typewriter istemal nahi karte.Nawaz- &#39;Typing ke shor se mere khayalat ki titliyan ud jaati hain&#39;....Waah nawaz bhai waah

Nc trailer Nandita Maam

Bollywood have a lot of potential if we remove our eyes from those glossy ,catchy,commercial,nonsense movies

Propoganda movie by nandita das.she belongs to  the pseudo secular,intolerance gang.bloody communists.

Going to bettar than Race 3

Way better than RACE 3

I WILL WATCH THIS IN THEATER!!

Nawazuddin is legend 

Nandita Das is a gem of an personality. And Nawaz Bhai puts life in to the character&#39;s. Manto - don&#39;t needed any introduction.

Sabka badla lega re nawaz 

Plz make it a 100 crore kb tk salman ko cheer kroge... I mean this the content...like if u agree

Very nice

Such Shitty trailer of Race 3 and such a great teaser of Manto.

Fr b kuch lawde salman ko actor kahte hae

Sirrajuddin- gurdas maan 

Bhai acting to ise hi khte h

supeb

Great 

I watched two movie trailors today 1st one of salman khan race 3 ... What a crap ...total waste of 3 min...of my life then  i came to watch this manto.. trailor what a master piece... Each and every moment of this trailor is worth watching... And i am definitely going to watch this movie in theater. If you are reading this please watch this kind of movie in theaters ... Thank you nawaz bhai ..god bless you

Another masterpiece... waiting eagerly

nawaz sahav acting se katal kar dete ho hamesha

Nawaz your acting is just...... wordless to describe

Bollywood is still alive.

Nawz shrf is good actor

Thx  for the movie on saadat hasan  manto.  I hope film will based on showing reality instead of making money....Its not my hope , its the hope of future generation..

when will this be on trending no.  1 instead of race 3

Nwaj bhai

<b>I will watch it. FUCK nepotism and cliched movies... Nawasudin&#39;s performance deserves a greater audience.</b>

He was a great writer 

Race 3 aur Sallu tatti bhaijan ke Chutiyaap mein ye ignore hoga .... Hail indian audience 

finallysome good shit from Bollywood

aisey pictures Indians ko samaj nahi ayegi...woh toh Race 3 he dekhenge jisme kuch dimag na chalana pade

He come with another epic film 

1000 times better than DUMBFUCK RACE 3

Movie bahut slow lg rahi hai teaser se

acting aur actor ye do word sunte h sbse pehle nawazuddin sir apki he naam yaad aati h

Amazing...

Thanda Gosht was perhaps the best piece of writing by Saadat Hasan Manto Sahab. I was really shocked when i first read that story, and it was unbelievable that such story was written at that time. Really, Manto was way ahead of his time. Now coming to this teaser of Manto, Nawaz bhai is perfectly suited for this role and he did play it very well. And I request to all the audience that you have always criticized that Bollywood didn&#39;t make good quality picture, so here it is, do watch it in theatre and support film like these. When you support film like these, the quality of our film will also be held high.

No we don&#39;t watch this kind of moviesWe watch shit movies of bhai

<b>zindagi jhand hogyi hai?? Meri videos shayad life badal de</b>

This movie wouldn’t earn 1/10th of Race 3, all thanks to bhaitards

Reminds me of Dalton Trumbo...

Very naaz on Nawaaz !Outstanding 

Jabardast acting....nawajuddin siddique ....One of greatest actor bollywood have and very down to earth man.....

Saddat Hassan Manto

Its the stone cold steve austin of bollywood...........oh hell yeah

How can someone press the dislike button for this???? How !!!

This I m going to watch anyhow saadat Ali manto the controversial writer

Often saadat hasan manto was challenged by his friends to write a play on whatever word they say,  he would take out his typewriter and write a beautiful play no one could ever imagine.  Once he was in his office and a boy came and asked &quot; ki mai andar aa skdaa&quot; (means may i come in please).  There he was challenged by someone to write a play on this title &quot;ki mai andar aa skda&quot;. And no doubt he wrote a beautiful piece with it. It&#39;s a very famous play. Everyone should read it. Such brilliant person was manto saab.

awwwwwsome

Saadat hasan manto. One of the greatest punjabi writer ever.

This guy is a pure genius  Never saw anyone act like this.

Another outstanding performance by nawazuddin sir

I&#39;ll watch this on theater

take one of the most vibrant and enigmatic actor of present day indian cinema and one of the greatest short story writer ever,undoubtedly the greatest in urdu literarure in his own words-&quot;grace equals only that of allah himself&quot;-quite a powerful cocktail to be precise

Nawas is one of the best actor...

Mast movie hai but flop ho jaegi kyuki yaha sirf gandu heros jinka acting se dur dur tak kuchh lena nahi aur gandu ghisi piti stroies hi chalti hai..

<a href="">

Bollywood is changing 

Wow ️

What a outstanding acting ,Nawaz sir ..... Of course watching it

Don&#39;t know how Nawaz is so flexible with every character... Brilliant acotr

Absolutely love how the image of the title looks like it&#39;s breaking into two, like the Partition which broke our country and on which Manto wrote so much. Can&#39;t wait! ️

402 chutiyo ne dislike kar diya. I hope they are fine with prem ratan dhan payo 

Awesome One of the finest actor in bollywood

,

Ek number !!

Definitely going to watch in theatre... script like these has to be appreciated...a big fan of Manton Sahab...

Astonishing work by Nawaz sir as usual, this actor delivers pure form of what is called Acting!!

कमल की बात है यह इंसान पाकिस्तान मै कैसे  रहा होगा ?

I hope audience will do justice with this beautiful upcoming movie 

Waiting for this movie

Guess what?? This movie will merely get hit tag coz we like Dilwale kind of shit. Anyway always glad to see how nawaz sir is making us proud.

Nawaz is the actor we deserve and Manto, what a character!

Why is this not in the &#39;trending&#39; list?!

Manto a great writer every time

Intezar rahe ga

Nawaz is killing it!

Wow....

me ye samajh ta hun ki  is film ko  har koi nhi  samajh paega  jo manto ke bare me jaan te h wahi samajh sake gen

Irfan khan nd Nawazuddin Siddiqui  best thing happened with Bollywood Cinema..They both wrote the new line of Acting..<a href="">#Peace</a>

Nawaz you beauty..



Super like

&quot;Farishta&quot;&quot;Thanda ghost&quot;&quot;Toba Tek singh&quot;&quot;Buu&quot;Jabardast kahani h ye...!

Nawaz se acha &quot;manto&quot; ka koi or act kr hi nahi sakta ...Aisa kii din nahi gya... Jis din manto ki kahaani yaad na aati ho..

Paagal manto

This will be Hit in Bollywood ..

Waaaaaha nice real acting real hero ,nawaz,

Why no release date yet 

Wr is chutiya dhawans fan show him dis grt Nawazuddin  dis call n acting lols

Manto  jesi saksiyt aur  aur  nawaj jesa adakar ummido ko badh deta hai. 

Trending pe kyn nai hai ye BC do kaudi ka Nagaraj tak trending pe aa gya tha

Is it just me that his get up looks like a classic bengali babu 

everyone will appriciate movie trailer but will go watch some masala movie in theatre

Can&#39;t  wait to watch. This movie

Relasing date ......

Awesome hitt hai bossss



Story of that man, who is story in himself.

An outstanding actor and an outstanding movie 

People shouldn&#39;t watch nandita das films because once she said &quot;every man is a potential rapist&quot;because of nawaz, I&#39;ll pirate and watch it.

Finally!!

Jab tak release date na pata ho teaser mat release kiya Karo ab is film ko dekhne Ka besabri se intjar Karna padega nawaj jaisa actor Bollywood main dubara paida Nahi hog

Nawazuddin is a bloody genius...... too good

Toba Tek Singh....... the first few pages shocked me like hill

Manto ki story &quot;&quot;thanda gost&quot;&quot;maine pdhi h.wo hmesha apni story me auratoon k bare me Bolte h. mujh bahut pasand h unki saari novel .

We feel proud to be born in a country where such revolutionary writers and incredible actors are born.... Salute to them.

GOD of ACTING!

Aakhir main afsaane hee reh jaate hai.. Aur unke kirdaar

Awesommeeeeeeeee

Manto Pakistani serial v nyc

Watch the uncut version<a href="">

nandita das is an intellect badass woman

mja ayega

Speechless

bakvasss

Sir aap na bhi bus kya batau aap ko....Ki aap 5star se bhi bade wale hai

Manto&#39;s writing was great.. greatest...And so of Nawaz&#39;s acting...Chalo first day first show fix!!!

An actor has to burn inside with an outer ease...and He proved this many times.!! <a href="">#Hattsoff</a>

Definitely going to watch

Waiting for it since 2 years

Background score Intriguing.

Gajab....

Bollywood is changing.....and its on the perfect way.....I loved the trailer

Always hilarious acting 

&quot;Manto&quot; ️

Nawazuddin Siddiqui  strong strong

Bhai 1st day 1st show Dekhta hu hamesha Nawaz Bhai ki movies   Or ye bhi dekhunga

Firstly I thought that I should not  watch this trailer coz I saw directed by Nandita Das as I hate this bitch lady then I thought no I should watch this just coz of Nawazuddin Siddiqui as I love this man from core of my heart....

Kamal h

His acting

music by sneha khanwalkar  

Watch my recent mind blowing video

This man is brillent....i live navaj bhai

Damn excited

Saddat hassan manto saab ️ nawazuddin sir ️

Are aayegi Kab ye movie

Is it by any means life of Ritwik Ghatak?

Release date is not mentioned?

release kab yogi ji

The teaser seems very dramatic and powerful, however the dialogs seem choreographed and unnatural, for anyone who&#39;s a true fan of Manto watch this - 

Nawaz on the verge of earning National award..

Shaandaar zabardast zindabaad

Nawaz at his very best wow

<a href="">

Bhut hard bhut hard

Hats off dear Creator .a perfect Casting of Manto Simply Superb

One more masterpiece of Nawazuddhin. But sadly Indians don&#39;t understand good movies and concept, they only like Salman Khan or Karan Johar or Rohit Shetty shite movies

jab ghulam hai to azadi ka khwab dekhenge...ab azad hai to konsa khwab dekhenge...

go to OSCAR

Thankgod bollywood has nawaz

I wish to see nandita das in front of camera as well.

...

Sad thing about india is that movies like this do not get that appreciation that they deserve :(

Yaha pe sab acting ki taarif karenge aur wohi log torrent pe download karke dekhenge

He is Faizal, Manto, Thackrey... HE IS NAWAAZUDIN 

Smoking kills Nwz.

When does this release....

Again a Pakistani.... Graduated From ALIGARH MUSLIM UNIVERSITY(A writer picks up his pen only when his sensibility is hurt).

Ye jo talented log hote hai ise kisi ki bhi jarurat nahi hoti ye apne aap uper aate hai

Supb actor

Nawazuddin Siddiqui...bas naam hi kaafi hai.. 

Nawaz just amazing as usual..... Best........ Fantastic......

Mast hai...

Nawaazuddin is great but I think Irfan khan would have done it better. Just a thought :) .

ye movie bahut pehle shoot hua tha....

Jab ghulam the to aazadi ka khvab dekhte the Aur ab aazad he to Konsa khvab dekhege !!

Akhir main afsaane hi reh jaate hain aur unke kirdaar...!

What a strong character!!!! Eagerly waiting for this masterpiece...love nawazuddin

&quot;Main itna likhunga ki tum bhuke Na marogi&quot;, &quot;Yahi toh fikra hai ki tumhare likhne ke wajah se he bhukhe marenge&quot; i have quit my job and started to blog a bit,can relate to this feeling

notice guys...this movie has plethora of grt actors..not a single hero :)

umeed karta hu ki indoor shots kum honge

finally some no nonsense movie. so powerful.

Nawaz sir is loved

Ache ache ko fatt jayegi aisa acting krne me...pura jaan hi daal dete ho nawaz bhai

adbhut.... Shandar Jardast Zindabaad

Sirf yahi afsana kehna chahunga...Shandaar Zabardast Zindabaad

Iski jagah sharukh ya Salman ki movie ka trailer hota to 10M views pakka the. Hamare Desh ki janata ko aisi filmo se jyada pyaar Mohabbat (illogical) films pasand aati hai. Jab hamari soch hi itni limited hai to bhai sarkar ko sara dosh mat do, buddhi to tumhari bhi zada kaam nahi Karti.

very nice!!!

Nandini ji 

Nawaj tujhe to m dekh lunga wo bhi theater m .... superb akhir m afsaney he reh jatey h

Don&#39;t know who was Manto, but Nawaz acted well.

Ye hai weed pi kr dehkne layak material mtlb gehrai m ghus jana hai

Aakhir me afsane hi rah jate hain aur unke kirdar

Kaun kaun Theater mein dekh kr ise successful   crore movie banana chahega

Trumbo

Hats off Nawazudin Siddqui

This men is ruling bollywood

Sir you are incredible in every character you play. This one also looks amazing!!!

pasand aaya

dhansu

the real actor

Nawaz Uddin is a ugly actor where as manto was a Kashmiri...they could  have taken someone else...Nawaz is just overrated.

Mujhe Manto k bare m jaana hai, isliye ye Movie bhi dekhunga chahe jaise .

This is the type of movie we need but do not deserve.Again, it will be overshadowed by some shitty commercial bollywood movies in the cinema hall.

kia kehne hai sahab Asli Manto ka haq ada kia hai...

Plz Indians audience ko Baghi-2 psnd hai is tarah ki masterpiece movies nahin... 



Nawaz bhai ️

He&#39;s definetly going to win a National Award for this masterpiece!

Bollywood is finding its roots aside from Criminal Salman&#39;s Crap...kudos

Manto one the best writers of India

*1 like for legend nawazuddin sidiquie*

film me jaan daal di nawas Bhai  great actor , always my favorite..... ,

sadat hasan manto

Great, but i m damn sure that we Indian will never appreciate such excellent work,,, we are going far from Art..

MAN…Wow.. Thackeray n now Manto .. This guy is creating Classic Cinema.. 

eagerly waiting. This certainly would be a masterpiece.

Zabardast

मंटो जैसे मजबूत किरदार को नवाज़ुद्दीन सिद्दीकी ही निभा  सकते हैं । इंतज़ार है इस फ़िल्म का

Sirjii

Eagerly waiting fr ths movie..... MANTO was a gr8 personality

super super

Can&#39;t wait 

Wow....thats all i can see

Very nice nawaz sir but Gurukul haridwar is miss u a lot

hopeke yeh rss wale ispein  koi vivadh khada na kare

one icon playing another icon

Acting

Look alike raj thakre

नवाज़ भाई awesome 

Of course Nawaz Bhai is awesome... what appeals me here is photography, use of light and the art direction as well.. even in a trailer of <a href="">1:28</a> mins it all takes you back and keeps you wanting for more!

Kab release Kroge yaa ab to bahut intezar ho gaya

epic

Great

waa

Story of Sadat Hassan Manto..

Looking good !

who else has watched Gangs of wasseypur more than 10 times?

What a thought provoking moving film this going to be. I wish many would watch. &quot;Aakhir mein afsane hi reh jaate hai&quot;.

manto abhi zinda hain

Bt still shitty bollywood wont applause him..<a href="">#Legend</a>_Nawaz

Nawaz bhai waittttttttt......

Master peice. Awesome acting by Nawaz.But people although appreciate these kind of movies but don&#39;t go to theaters to watch the movie. Due to which it dosent earn as much profit.

Aakhir me afsane hi rah jate hai or unke kirdaar 

Sadath Hussain mintoo 

Akhir me afsane hi re jaate Hain aur unke kirdaar great dialogue



shaandaar jabardast bindaas

Glad her pending project got completed.. best wishes to Nandita Das.

Manto is like Tesla of the hindi literature.Good luck for team manto

Super owsome

Another masterpiece by nawaz sir (the real superstar)... Thanks to nanditaa daas (director) for making this movie based on the life of sadat hasan manto. ..

Release date??

Manto was misunderstood then..now we celebrate him..life is like that, we discredit genius noble people who are living ..only to recognise them after they are dead..

Undoubtedly a masterpiece...Saddat hussain mantoo...

Thank You @nanditadas for making this film.... You have given us a real masterpiece......

For more short films<a href="">

Odisha is Proud of you &quot;Nandita Mam &quot;

<a href="">1:15</a> aakhir mein afsane hi rah jate hai aur unke kirdaar...... Nawazuddin 

Novel?

Now nobody will watch this kind of masterpiece and later they will criticize bollywood by saying bollywood sucks.. actually our audience sucks

Nawaj as Manto Combo

I’m sure this movie is going to make a big impact on indian cinema

Pakistani drama manto is far better nawaz seems average

Nawazuddin Siddiqui - the reason I have not given up watching Bollywood movies. Dear Indian audience, a humble request from me, I beg you to stop watching garbages and promote golds like him, so that Indian cinema doesn&#39;t looses it&#39;s shine.

Just awesome .. Nandita Das ma&#39;am u nailed it.. Wow.. Good luck <a href="">#TeamManto</a> spcly Nawaaz bhai..

Extended cast has javed akhtar .... Wow!

Exited

So, my grandmother visited me a couple of months back. She is a writer and poet and she used to tell us stories when we were kids. So this time I gave her my kindle to read. We started looking for novels on Amazon and the moment she saw Manto&#39;s name she got excited as lil kid. He is her favourite writer and his stories inspired her to become a writer. Glad to see nawaz don this role.

NS is just looking as sunny paa ji

looks amazing

Wow  it was superb ️

Excellent trailer !

All the best to Rashika duggal

He is back.... acting level ...looking good now after some movies

Looks sooo good! Heartening to see Nawazuddin Siddiqui do real work again.

This is going to be huuuuge

stronger and dynamic the cinema stronger the nation...

Master peice

Eagerly waiting for this ️

मुझे &quot;मंटो&quot; नें बेसब्र बना दिया है...

<b>&quot;aakhir mein afsaane hi reh jaate hain , aur unke kirdaar &quot;</b>

Nawaz And Rasika &lt;3

a rebellious Writer. . .Manto. . .Grand Salute to the makers of this film...Nawaz 

Hopefully it will be a full movie not a 5 min add like last time

Bahut acha lag raha hai. Bollywood log kabhi kabhar Hindu authors, Poet or humarae  famous personalities par bhi film banaya karo. Mujhe aaj bhi samaj main yeh nahi aaya ki Bollywood log Hindus Ko itna Nafarath kyu karthey hai. Lagta naamard dawood ibrahim abhi bhi bollywood Ko chalatha hai shayad islehay hogo

<a href="">

<b>Why this teaser not in trending?</b> <b>why gandii baat types of trailer TRENDING</b> ? What wrong with Indian audience?  <a href="">#manto</a> <a href="">#goodcinema</a> <a href="">#bestactor</a> <a href="">#nawazuddin</a>

Sarmad Khoosat and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, both fine method actors, played Manto.

Truth is just ready to come out...

1st

Thanku viacom for this.For me GREAT Manto , Great story.

It has been officially selected for Cannes Film Festival 2018.All the best.

यही सब किरदार नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी को शूट किया करते हैंgood good the does....

Sure super hit

Dislike sirf wo chutiye kar rhe hain jinko pta hi nhi hai..Sadat hasan Manto k baare main..



I am getting a feeling this performance of Nawaz is going to be a benchmark for generations to come

Ok

Which language they are speaking....I think this is not hindi...

Versatile actor...

Hey i m first

Gajab hai Nawaz bhai.....

Strong! Strong! Strong!

Wow!

<a href="">1:14</a> ramsay bolton looks lit af

really i am commenting first................... nawaz sir salam

is this a story of the great Ritwik Ghatak?

Great

They could&#39;ve given some credit to Rasika Duggal as well alongside Nawazuddin and Nandita.

Stupid dislikers

This is an amazing trailer! It&#39;ll be a delight to watch Nawazuddin in this role.

Nice

You rock..... 

brilliant job by @Nawazuddin Sir and @Nandita ma&#39;am. A movie is should be a medium to portray the voice of people and actor is who completely indulge himself in the character. The movie will be well appreciated and this kind of the work bring change to the mere brand promoting commercial act. Thank you ,

Mast teaser h Saab

When is it coming?

Looks amazing. Best of luck.

Top crew from the industry !!!

All intellectual commenters

Mind Blowing

Thanks for making some sensible movies.

Mout k tamashe

&quot;aakhir mein afsaane hi rah jaate hain... aur unke kirdaar&quot;

Seems like a awesome movie .

&#39;Saadat hasan manto&#39; can be referred to as &#39;Premchand&#39; of pakistan

Great

my First comment super nawaz

Great

Ghanto :-)

One request to all fans of Nawaz bhai or Manto sahab.. please go and watch this movie in theatre .. they should be appreciated.. 

Epic, manto is a legend.

Khwab ke

Whoosh still there’s some creativity left 

Great

Intejar ki inteha ho gayi....kb deede teri shakshiyat se   roobru honge!!!

manto kabhi bhi itne energetic nani the aur na hi itne gusse wale i think this time nandita das rnd needs more rnd

Fabulous video

Powerful 

Nawaz at his best

Going to watch it

Je baat......

actor acting acknowledge

Real actor

Waaah.. Kya baat hai.. A film about a  great writer .  This film Seems to be very interesting.

Nice

Nawaz fans 

why zero comments?

Superb

had this been a popular a league star playing manto, regardless of how far they r from this kind of a performance, people would have fapped to it!

Yet another pretentious crap of seemingly intellectual movie by super hyped Nawajuddin Siddiqui as Manto as if Manto was someone larger than other figures of that time - Tagore, Chatterjee and others. Nandita Das - a leftie placard idiot is the director, ahh I see why!

واقعی موضوع ادکار ہیں سعادت حسن منٹو کے لیے نواز الدین صدیقی

Nawaz sir will definitely win some award for this role

Seems an intense performance. Looking forward.

Shandaar Zabardasht

And there are some bastards whi dislike this video..

Nawaaz

Wow lots of love.. Nawazuddin sir 

Best of Nawaz sir !!!

mast Hai yar.

What&#39;s with him covering her daughter&#39;s ears when Bharat Zindabad slogans are spoken?

please watch bhag milkha bhag movie

i think u should make it more interesting and viewable  by adding some masala which will make it more commercial no doubt acting is strong but direction is little weak please make it more commercial  becoz every people will not be able to understand that what ever u have made

Waiting fr dis movie 

Release date ??

nawaz

Love Nawaz bhai

Sahi kaha ... aakhir mein afsaane hi rehe jaate hain.

gd teaser

I thought its movie about PremChand.

Pathetic Acting by Nawaz. He is not suitable for Portraying The great Manto Saab. Nawaz is Just delivering the dialogues given to him. &quot;Nawaz saab, Manto ka shakshiat itni unchi hai ke aap unke saamne kahin nahi thehrate, Manto ka kirdar nibhane ke liye.. Khud MANTO ban na padta hai.. Jo ki namumkin hai..&quot;

Superb <a href="">#Navajsir</a>

Very nice

The movie is fine, but i hate Nandita Das.

OMG !!Sadat hasan manto !!!his STORY always make me change my decision about the world !!

.

Best

What a coincidence just yestarday I read his satire story Toba Tek Singh because it was the part of my univercities alternative english syllabus and gave a exam on it today...and just now I saw this trailer...I even wrote The charater sketch of Bisen Singh in the exam...and yestarday I came to know about his other writings even Thanda Gosh...and now I want to watch this movies...

yr movie kb aa rhi h

Mind blowing

Wow

fantastic movie nawaz

waiting to watch this movie

Great to see the legend come life.Huge greetings to cast and wishes for success ahead. 

Bahut jaaldi Khatam nahi ho Gaya!..........Wow!

Behad khoobsurat

mast

Definitely watching for Nandita das

I m a Bengali literature student... n I love manto

Saadat Hasan Manto. One of my favourie authors. Have been waiting for the trailer for a long time!

viacom.. pls make a movie on our hero &quot;Veer lachit barphukan&quot;. If don&#39;t know, who he was, pls search on google.

Thank you Nandita mam for choosing someone like Nawaz sir for playing great &quot;Manto&quot;.....Bol ki lab azaad hain tere.....

Great movie it will be! Nawaz&#39;s acting and Nandita Das&#39;s commitment to tell the story of a writer who is important for both India and Pakistan would be loved by fans across the borders as well :)

Great

As usual Nawaz bhal awesome.

मंटो तुझे सलाम। क्या खूब तुमने समाज की नंगई को कागज़ में उतारा है। वो स्याह चेहरा जो  हर घर,हर गली ,हर कोठे, हर चौबारे के अंधेरे सीलन भरे कोने में लालच और हवस आंखों में लिए बेशर्मी भरी मुस्कान के साथ वहाँ होते हुए भी बचा रहता था, तुमने उसे घसीट कर रोशनी में ला दिया। सलाम।

I am a huge fan Manto Sahab. According to me, he is the greatest short story writer. Unhone acche se acche insaan ke andar burai khodi hai ....aur bure se bure insaan ki acchai ujagar kari hai.

Nawaz bhaiii awesome h

Legend!

Going to Oscar .......

Dull

Nawazuddin baap of all actors

Ek azaad khayaal...... ,Kirdaar, funkar dono hi lajawab

ready for Another great performance done by Nawaz Sir .

firsr

Wow... This is something worth watching... :)

Now a days Nawazuddin Siddiqui looks healthy earlier he was struggling and very skinny



Why no one has commented yet? I am the first one to comment it seems. Nawazuddin Bhai you again nailed it. National award may be waiting for you.

Good one

release date kya h?

Once Rishi Kapoor said Nawazuddin siddique that you will never be a good actor now he produced manto

Nandita Das did a great job...Nawazuddin  as Saadat Hasan Manto on Silver screen looks awesome

Don&#39;t comment or like this video unless you know what Manto has written. Let&#39;s remember him through his words but not as Nawazuddin Siddique performance

Yeh movie bhi flop hogi only legends can like my comment.......

ਬੇਸਬਰੀ ਉਡੀਂਕ ,,,,,,

enough bashing of Bollywood...every year tonnes of great movies are released ( mukkabaaz, raazi, padmawat, padman, raid, hichki, October, manto, etc for this year)...but so called Hollywood lovers remember baaghi 2 or tiger and start bashing Bollywood...

Can&#39;t wait...

outstanding nawaz bhaijaan

Manto was the critical input to the society...Was waiting for this badly

Great Acting...
