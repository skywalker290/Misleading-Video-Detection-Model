THE MOST UNDERRATED SONG IN MUSIC HISTORY

Miss you k k sir......
Kk forever ❤mesmerizing voice always ❤️ 💖 ♥️
Still listening in 2024

No matter what people say about this movie, I liked it. It&#39;s not a phenomenal typical Imtiaz Ali tier movie but it is a quite well culminated love story set in a modern world with modern problems and modern cultures. It&#39;s not a typical old-school romantic comedy/drama movie like Jab We Met or the Rockstar movie but it focuses on a different perspective of modern day romantic relationships. I also feel like Kartik Aryan did a phenomenal job in this movie. At <a href="">3:53</a> we see him dancing but he expresses his condition so well through his eyes that it makes us feel that he is in no shape to dance at the moment. The hopelessness in his eyes show how he just dances staring blankly just to fool his mind and make him feel like he is okay, and nothing is wrong. Which is a very common human nature usually seen when an individual is in acute denial about something terrible that just happened. Kartik Aaryan deserves to be cast in more similar roles with emotional depth. My man absolutely nails it at pulling off comedic roles as we&#39;ve seen in most of his other movies but this movie proves that he has great potential at pulling off more realistic emotionally deeper characters. But I know not everybody will agree to my last statement and I respect their opinion.Also I love the song. KK requires no introduction and It&#39;s one of KK&#39;s last songs and it&#39;s terribly underrated for some reason. Love it.Rest in peace, KK.

One of my favourite song ✨✨👍👍
Last KK Song!

Itna kyu mere sath ayi tu !

Gem this song is

miss you k.k.😢😢😢😢
This song has so much emotion to it...that only few can understand...it really takes you to the another world if you connect with the. Chorus, arrangement, lyrics and ofcourse k.k♥️♥️

Sooo sooo underrated ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish KK could have performed this song live 😭💔

I have never been able to speak like this these days, what note are you making, your voice is so clean, hard ❤❤
KK ❤&amp; pritam da , nothing else to say . Its one of the best musical team.👍

I don&#39;t remember any song 🥺😭

Just love. This song great feeling ❤

This film is iconic in my life...I was in a relationship for the first time in my life..then this film was realised..and we both went to the cinema hall to watch this film. For the first time with a girl... these were very different feelings. After 3 years we both broke up...now he misses her...but he is happy with someone else. The first love that remained incomplete with me🖤..he cheated on me and ran away from me😢. Now I just hate this love..I don't trust any girl right now. The stone heart has turned into a human being. This film's song 'Agar kehi gunjta huwa suna v mere rongte khade ho jate hei'💔🖤. She taught me a lesson...she gave up her life for me...she sacrificed my life for the sake of something better. I was so deceived by my first love...and I didn't have the courage to love anyone...I couldn't trust anyone...🥲

So sweet song love this song ❤

As a typical introvert ( I used to act like him and still do and even look like him.) I am surprised how this movie matches my life so much.  My love life is the same as it is shown in the film, there is no difference, today I have seen this movie and I have understood that it is a game of all time as shown here. I am the <b>Veer</b> of my story I have lost Zoe and I am sure I will find her again, but I don&#39;t know the time, when what will happen. My girlfriend is like Zoe Just career and career all the time . . but I&#39;m hoping for best and yyup mai bhi yahi maanta hu ki duniya me 2+2 se zyada bhi hota hai  ❤ aur compromised relationship mai kisi ke saath bhi kar lunga bas uske saath nahi karunga..❤

Ladies &amp; gentleman, salute to all of you gathering here listening to this masterpiece from our beloved KK..you truly have good taste of music..love from Malaysia. ❤❤❤

Anyone that can help me with the name of the temple in the last part of the song.

KK is legend
Only 23k likes and 1.7M views 💔.. this generation don&#39;t deserve best music, didn&#39;t deserve KKThey are happy with trash

Last song of kk

Sometimes we don&#39;t search for songs,We search for magic❤KK Sir 💯🙌

Miss u KK sir... Hard to believe that u left us in the mid way... but now u made the heaven even more beautiful...U r and u will always b our fav... Rest in peace sir... Love u

Miss you kk sir😢
<a href="">3:18</a> to <a href="">3:52</a> - The only singer who can lift the emotions of a song to the highest level.. KK ❤️ Miss you legend.. rest in peace.

this may be kks last song, if so he saved this album with this song, otherwise album no use without this song...

People were not even ready for this masterpiece in 2020

Love this song❤

We lost a terrific singer...yes kk was just amazing 👏.  He was always perfect. But sad, we didn&#39;t realize his talent,  while he was alive.

Kk the legend.voice at the age of 50 unbelievable 😮

One of the last songs of KK in bollywood. KK didn’t get what he deserved except 2008-2010. T series also responsible for not giving him songs after 2013-2014. Ps the best part of the song <a href="">3:17</a> to <a href="">3:52</a>

Only legend understand lyrics...❤ masterpiece

It&#39;s problematic to see such songs not even getting 50 million views.. C&#39;mon if views are so less then u can&#39;t even blame the music companies for not giving songs to older singers.. It&#39;s sad to digest this cruel reality... Even after KK&#39;s death the views didn&#39;t get any sort or boost.. Any songs of lord Kakkars, baadshah etc. manage to get 30-40 million views at minimum.. The world&#39;s not a fair place after all...  KK u deserved more, more and MORE..

Goat are
Master piece by KK sir miss this voice.... what a deep voice...❤❤

Highly underrated

Kk sir ❤❤❤😢
This movie will be called cult in coming years from now .. Imtiaz Ali couldnt save it from the horrors of Sara&#39;s acting but rest everything was on point

<a href="">0:05</a> ❤love it
Need Indonesian subtitles to understand the lyrics😊
kk 😪😪
Hauntingly beautiful, used this background score for one of my poetic renditions. Do give it a view @<a href="">

Kk sir love you what a voice..... Thanks for one of the best song of yours.... God is so unfair....

i just saw this movie just week before KK&#39;s death and was listening this song since 1 week on loop and suddenly heard his death news😢💔i broke down💔😢

Kk sir💔
After listening to this song I m in another world … what a singer KK was ..legend of Bollywood…filled every words with emotions

immortal song by legend  KK

<a href="">3:52</a> explains the song perfectly!Amazingly potrayed by Imtiaz ali and the lyrics written by Irshad Kamil are both perfect for the song and the situation of this sceneThey both were trying to occupy themselves but their inside hollowness can’t let it happen. They both were their in the moment but you can by the tears of them that they were not. Truly a masterpiece and yess KK’s demise can’t be fulfilled 💔

Miss you kk
Miss you kk
Highly underrated. This is absolutely high class lyrical song that generally people won&#39;t understand. Awesome

Himachal heven❤
We wish more from you KK. But you&#39;ve gone too early. My eyes are full of tears still now. Why you didn&#39;t take care of your health ???

You would hear this song in bits and pieces in the movie .. but once you hear it full .. trust me you would be addicted .. it’s my 100 time or more here ✌🏻

What a song 😍

Love you, Kartik! ❤😘
From now till when will I go to listen to kk sir's voice🥺 I miss you kk sir😞
Each and every comment has the same feelings. Listening to this song on loop! Thank you Pritam and KK 😭🥺

Drds

I just loved KK Sir❤❤❤❤ Kartik expressions 👌👌👌👌❤
Kudos to Imtiaz Ali Sir for replacing Darshan Raval Mehrama song with KK&#39;s Aur Tanha in final draft of this movie🙏🏻

Ap phone pick ni karti

Feel the emotions... Feel the love.... Feel K.K

Miss u💔
My fev song

Kartik when he dances shows great emotion as if he is really missing his girlfriend. So much pain in his eyes. Great actor!

Star kid vs REAL kid
The best and most underrated song from the album.

Yoon tera hona bhi ( your songs) aur tanha karta ( miss you kk sir) &lt;3

This song gives me a whole another level of peace for some reasons.

Aaj 2023 mei recommend hua ye song yaa4
This is my favorite one♥

kk we r listening u here..💔

Fantastic rendering

Hdhhdhd

With kk I lost my robit too. Rip to my love Robit. Kk lives in a our heart.

@sonymusic can you please release the studio version of this song 🙏🙏

Underrated extraordinary masterpiece from and underrated extraordinary movie. I don&#39;t know when I will stop listening to this song. Seems entered a loop. Gotta kind of addiction. If one wish I could make which comes true is bring KK back. Miss him so much 😣

What a background tune.......fall in love with this magic of tone n lyrics together

One of the most underrated songs❤

I do not want to convince anyone but I swear I tried to memorise the song inorder to sing it. But till date I forget the lyrics when I hear it on my earphones. One gets carried away by the music, Irshad Sahab&#39;s lyrics. Moreover one should never try to sync lips with any of KK&#39;s song. Feels like his songs are meant to be heard in his voice only.I used to wait for his songs. He cannot be replaced by anyone 🧡

Hey gaye vo chutiya arijit fans jino phati awz pasand h.. 🔥🔥🔥 Arijit's.. mhu bandh ka bhi ho ह
<a href="">2:15</a>

What a song...

Most Underrated Song of KK.

Damn bruhhhh kk ❤🐐
Miss KK 🥺
Super song 😌 kuch chiz jate jate hi jati hai ...

You don’t need alcohol anymore , try KK’s soulful rendition. We miss him a lot ❤

This is underrated. Discovered this masterpiece after KK&#39;s death, it makes me sad that this kind of melody won&#39;t be repeated.

Yu Tera bhi hona bhi hai and karta hai
Pritam ko pta hota to 🥺🥺 movie me song kk ke ek rur hota 🥺🥺..only pritam respects kk ko in Mahesh Bhatt camp
KK💚
Missing you KK

Wow... Remembering my 💕 whenever  I listen to this gem by KK.

This movie will be a hit but it will flop due to SAK's overacting.
KK❤️
Kk sir even today I miss you a lot I always miss you sir..😭 ❤
We miss you KK. We can feel YOUR SOUL in this beautiful song. ❤<a href="">#kkforever</a>

KK always sounds soulful, gentle and sophisticated.  True legend🙏

Miss you KK

Do You Know What Real Success is ??Jab Aap iss Duniya se Chle Jaao Uske Baad B Aapki Awaaz Ko Koii Replace Na Kar Sake…Aapko 1000 Singers Mimicry Artist Mil Jaayenge Lekin KK Sir Ka Nahi Milega…Log Kehte H Arijit is King...But God Of Music To Kk Hi Rahenge
So underrated song

When that song was   realise , i was facing my Breakup and while driving i listen and Tear&#39;s come , from that I can feel pain, 😄😄😄😄😄 she cheated me.

My all tym fav singer.....😍😍.....
Miss you legend

KK is still alive  !!!!! Perhaps this is called &#39;magic&#39;..

All the songs of this movie and the old Love Aaj Kal were masterpieces , pure magic from Imtiaz + Irshad + Pritam legendary trio

While today&#39;s crowd was so busy shoving their a** with pathetic singers, in between we lost a legend. RIP K.K.  You will live forever in hearts.

K.K. 🥺❤️
This is what happens and makes me lonely...💔
this song so addicted i listen this more than 5 times a day..............

Beautifully sung by KK! 🙂

Now you are a girl, I am really your friend, why are you my friend's guest ❤️❤️
When you listen this masterpiece at 3am and started remembering about her makes the song more emotional 💔

@<a href="">3:38</a> unexpected scale change is main highlight of this song along with the Yodeling, it was changed like gears in a car

KK 🔥
KK naam hi kaafi hai. Sayeed Quadri Sahab should have written the lyrics.

One more song added in my favourite list among all of his songs.

Only kk 💔😭😞💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭😭
All time miss you KK sir......... 💔
Mai yoon tanha jeeta hu ..Jese koi martaKk nailed this line 🔥

Kk 🙏🏿
One of the most underated song, Touching

Blessed to have grown up in an era when kk &#39;s songs rocked the music industry... used to sing his songs in unison while travelling in school bus, his songs used to be played in freshers as well as farewell functions, and countless memories attached with his songs...RIP legend

I know everyone is reading comments. Kk we loves u ❤️

It was never about playback singing..it is about singing with soul...each and every song of kk has a beautiful lyrics penned by great lyricists..like gulzaar sahab, javed akhtar, mehboob, sayed quadri, irshad kamil, nilesh misra etc... And kk sand only thise songs which touched his heart. So its not about playback singing...but giving life to the lyrics and embedding emotions in them.. thats why kk fans know what true music is and what huge loss we have suffered .... <a href="">#kkforever</a> <a href="">#noonelikekk</a>

Miss u sooooo much kk

Pritam+KK=Heaven ❤️
Perhaps such a voice will never be found again.
What a song!? This song with such quality is underrated! I have no words! Rest in peace KK, the legend.

Lost into dance at the end is the exactly what osho was talking about

This is honestly the best song of the album. Different composition using African folk with soft rock and fantastic singing by The Mesmerizer. Should have been more aggressively promoted. I think even film producers these days have very bland and shitty musical taste!

kk died on my sister&#39;s birthday :(

what a voice, he will be truly missed

Why such songs don&#39;t get properly promoted.

K.k.sir I'm back 😥😥😥
Miss you kk
Kk❤️❤️
Unbeatable voice for World 🌎,   Legend Kk💥💥💥
Yes coming yesterday

I don&#39;t know but the lyrics literally breaks heart💔💔💔💔

Ufff...Those high notes!!! &quot;No one makes a promise, no one forgets.&quot;
Kk sir..miss you a lot sir..aap to chale gye hum to bss rahe hai..kuch bhi aha aha kuch nahi aap ke song hai hai rona hai..God sir ko ek de chance de hai…sir aap Without you there is much missing in life sir.. Miss you badly dear sir..🥺💔
This song is different from the songs of other album 😊 KK is different ♥️

This song is underrated but it is not ordinary song 🥺

Rd burmanish composition..and kk is kk... One and only KK

Whatever anybody say but sara is superb in movie

Kk 💔
Miss you kk full time....

Song of the decade for sure❤️

Plz KK Sir go back 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The haunting vibes of this song gives goosebumps and makes me listen several times! Truly a masterpiece song by Pritam + KK. But I wonder why its so underrated, the times and taste of people about music has changed a lot. But a true admirer of music will definitely appreciate. <a href="">#RIP_KK</a>. You will always stay alive in our heart and soul.

Kk is kk gaane ka style sabse alag amazing as always

KK sir my favourite singer in my college life (2012-15) iske alawa koi n other name nhi tha . Miss u always remember in our heart ❤️

You were amazing singer KK sir, this song give me goosebumps and as well as want me to cry❤️

Love you Sartik ❤️
Love you KKI used to cry with this songNow I cry for your absence..Really don&#39;t know why this happened..Maybe God loved you more than we did...

Only kk sir😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every comment here is about kk even before his death , glad that people valued and appreciated him even before his death .

Kk ❤️
It&#39;s been only four days and I&#39;ve already listened to this song over 25 times. I can&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t have listened to this fantastic song for so long? However, many thanks to <a href="">#ShilpaRao</a>, the co-singer behind &quot;Khuda Jaane&quot;. I was just randomly searching old interviews of KK and what other celebs talk about him, then I found one video where she was seen mentioning this song &quot;AUR TANHA&quot; from the movie Love Aaj Kal 2 (2020). It just gave me goosebumps. No other singer in the entire universe can bring such magic and feel through his songs after Kishore Kumar &amp; Kumar Sanu. I can&#39;t get you out of my mind and  heart. I really don&#39;t want. It pains me a lot having the knowledge of u not being around. You&#39;re gonna stay forever through your simplicity, smile and songs..

I liked it for kk

<a href="">2:21</a> the real haunting starts from here

Legend RIP
KK The Mesmerizer, You are eternal.

There will be no one like u KK sir..❤️ miss u so much..😭😭😭 please come back.. 😭

No hate but arijit, jubin and other singers has saturated the industry with same monotonous songs that KK&#39;s voice feels like a breathe of fresh air.

KK will live forever!

In kk&#39;s voice each and every song is phenomenal...

KK , please return if possible..we need you..💔🙏

Miss uhhh KK💔💔...
Superrrb Awesome Fantastic song

OMG so perfectly sung by The legend..there is so much soulfulness in his voice that i get goosebumps everytime i listen to it...Really Kk was the &quot;GOD OF SINGING &quot; hats off to such legend. Forever Kk 🌷🌷

😭kk 💔
miss you kk sir
Sir, your voice is god of voice in this industry, we all are missing you, we are waiting come again and tell us about your journey 🥺🥺 we just want to meet you 😔😔😔

KK ki aawaaz amar hai. He was one of the finest singers that our country has produced although I never met him even millions of people who never met him but he made relationship with crores of people with his voice and feel like we all lost someone closer to us.

I am sorry KK sir

That one singer who was constant in the playlist since school and now he is brutally snatched away from us, that magical voice will no longer be heard but he gave us enough to go on ..Kk sir we love you 💓💔

Ye awaj is era me nhi mil sakti love u kk😢 ab to KK apke song sunne me rona a jata h

His last released song.. Lobe u K.K

Pure voice
&quot;When an artist dies, the art that never was is often mourned with as much grief as-if not more grief than the individual themself. The individual, after all, was flesh and blood. It&#39;s the art that&#39;s immortal.&quot;

Legend Never Dies KK Sir You Will Always Be In Our Hearts ♥️My First Singer That I Had Listen From Age of 7 and my inspiration ♥️♥️ You Will Be Missed Sir ....Kk Is Emotion ♥️♥️

Pritam Saab name he is enough❤️
I have listened this song for many times

Most underrated song

Just feel like listening to kk&#39; songs and just forget all worries of life so soothing his voice is 🙂👍

When you release someone but fail to free yourself from them.

KK&#39;s voice is magical

I am big fan of u kk

Luv u bro
K K 👌
So magical you are KK.. really love your voice n feel..

KK ❤
Kya song hai yaar ye kahan aur hi le jata hai aur is song ka music just amazing ek feeling hai sach mein
Kk ♥️♥️♥️
Even his new songs r evergreen such a underrated legend

The freshness that KK brings to this song is just fabulous.

kk remembered back me 1999 to 2005

Sometimes I listen to this song on repeat and can work for whole night in front of laptop.

We need more songs of kk

The credit goes to Pritam amazing music.... And amazing singer Kk...

Nice song
yaa filling alone love is one only one ..forever .sif u u i tu hi tu love for u

KK

KK sir is one of the great singer of Indian music history..

KK

The views on this song prove that audience with good taste in music are decreasing very rapidly.

I listened this song after watching the interview of Pritam-Irshad-Imtiaz with some channel... And then I found it very boring at the start and thought it&#39;s just an average song... And being a KKian I just don&#39;t like KK having average songs... But Here I decided that I&#39;ll listen this till the very end... And man... It was melody.Literally Pritam only could make such a soothing song yet it being a sad one... KK&#39;s high notes and soothing voice also nailed it while Irshad&#39;s lyrics were also great.I just see now that I can&#39;t expect kind of songs from bollywood which were made in late 90s &amp; early-mid-late 2000s... Like Dil Ibadat or Labon kind songs for example.They are milestones and these songs literally doesn&#39;t have a chance(including this Aur Tanha song too) in front of 2000s music.Anyway this song was still kind of &quot;best kind of&quot; from the generation it came out in. Nowadays we don&#39;t expect melodies but still Pritam has got some legacy so we still can expect some good melodies nowadays.

K.k ❤️❤️
My fav. Song

Where did Pritam ji copy the song from?
:) this whole messed up generation can&#39;t understand kk!

Always fav...KKK💙
K. K. &#39;s full form Krishnkumar Kunthan. South Indian singer

<a href="">3:30</a> that vocals🔥Can&#39;t believe the guy turned 53 last year ♥️

Why this song has less views btw my fav song 🎵😍

My observations of this music video, from <a href="">0:05</a>-<a href="">0:30</a>, the girl in this music video, her body language is quite impressive. In beginning of video of course. It impresses the guy so much!

The only singer in Bollywood who can sing the high notes with so much ease!😇

KK singing this song in 50+ageWhat a Fresh voice still--☺

My love only towards kk

Tune music 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This song has 2006&#39;s Vibe!!!Rest in Peace K.K

This song is such a vibe 😍 singing,music 🔥

kk legend 🔥🔥❣❣❣
Extremely good !! Love it

Ese hote ha ghzbb songs or inki phchaan hoti ha inke views or likes are less than toni kakkar's songs.
KK 💞
This song made for two legend&#39;sKk or Mohit Chouhan

Meanwhile Bachpan ka pyar has 32 crore views🥵😱
I was reading with you tube auto generated playlist on in background, and as vocals started, I recognised it was k.k. and I knew this is gonna be special! This man never disappoints!!

<a href="">0:11</a> to <a href="">0:45</a> part is mesmerizing

Zindagi Hai Ye Song
Ye composition jubin aur arjit nahi gaa saktay thay pritam ne kk se gawaa k baazi maarli
KK: always magical 💫
The name is enough. KK + Pritam = Goosebumps ❤️

Whoever wrote this line is like this
Underrated one.

Music director pritam ko KK singer ko or song dene chahiye..Kk or pritam ki jodi ka koi tod nhi ..Almost song super hits..

K.K is a legend

im big fan of KK ❣❣❣❣

One of best song of kk ... Magic voice...Always rock star kk

Mesmerising KK

Heere ki parakh johari ko hi hoti hai , 😅 that&#39;s why Here views are defining that we are 🥰🥰 not every fuddu listener

I love this songI love KK Voice❤️

Main yun tanha jeeta hoon, jaise koi marta, Yeh bhi koi jeena hai, jo hai aankhe bharta, Yun tera hona bhi, aur tanha karta. I wonder how can a person come up with lyrics so freaking sad. This is loneliness at its peaks.

In today’s era only auto tuners are getting more views not these kind of legend singers ...sad to see

KK songs should be promoted with tag line&quot;By K.K the mesmerizer of decade.&quot;

I love this song so much

I love you kk sir 😘😘😚😚😚😚😚
Kk 🔥🔥❤❤Not even 1 million view.. Indian audience 👏👏
Haunting melody. Breathtaking cinematography. Brilliant acting.

KK voice always legend 😊🎧👌
Our childhood legend KK. Kk mera pura bachpan hai I was grow up listening his songs💚🥺

I used to think Kartik can&#39;t act, does stereotypical films and roles.The last 1 minute of this song changed my mind.Hope he does justice to his talent by choosing good films.

Why there is not millions of view in this song Let me tell you this answerCause of loss of taste to viewers if it is right then like here 👇👇

I have no girlfriend butWhen iam listening this 🥺 song -This song make me 😭

This man..... Mesmerizing me since since 1998.... That voice....I call him a part of my collective consciousness

Why don't you sleep too, it looks fantastic
Love uy fav kk no one touch ur voice god gifted

God.. Kya song🎵🎵 hai... Kk special... Love you😘😘😘❤❤❤ sir. Most underrated song of this era.... Common people.. Kya hai yeh yaar  ..
KK forever ❤️
Underrated song

K.k 🔥🔥❤️ most underrated song
<a href="">#KK</a> sir ❤️
It is rare to find 3 - 4 good Original songs in an movie album Nowadays.

Imtiyaz Ali&#39;s portrayal of loneliness arising out of unfulfilled love is absolute class and shockingly true without being over dramatic. He has done this in atleast one scene of all the movies he&#39;s directed and he absolutely nailed it with this one too. Kudos to his mastery.This song is literal perfection. Every little thing about the song is absolutely stunning and perfect. This coming from today&#39;s Bollywood Music Industry is quite a shock. KK is Love..!!

Kk  voice gives2 in one vibes bollywood and pop

Wow this song is gorgeous

Neha Tony to thik par arijit ko galat bolne walo ke paas music kisi samajh nh hh

No song is dependent upon movie arijit sir ke gaane toh hit hue

If someone is telling that this song is underrated so listen it is overrated

What nonsense to sing?
love your voice bro..KK 🤘🤘🤘
This type of song don&#39;t have more views why I don&#39;t know actually they don&#39;t know what is real talent

I have seen many friends, all of them have their hearts broken at one time or the other, but I think girls' hearts also get broken, I think, a good-natured and true person meets a liar, a mean person, a wrong person. ,,.... Never hurt anyone,♥️...
Bhot galat he yar so kam view ko bhi so beautifull song ko
Oh my lord Krishna. Thank you for my idol KK 🙏

Love you

<a href="">4:26</a>The most powerful yet helpless feeling in the universe that only those who have truly loved &amp; lost can understand. 😢.

Kk is most promising and emotional voice

This is not KK who is singing this song 🖤 all musical instruments are singing with KK 🖤💯

What a mesmerizing voice kk sir has.. That he perfectly overshadowed kartik and sara

What a soulful song.. The best song from the album I feel.. Don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t promote kk sir&#39;s song like other songs of the same album..

Kk voice is best

Kk is legend
K.k sir ❤️

No words... The great KK.. 🙏

Only legends are here for legendary voice

Why didn't I show this song while promoting it... I didn't even know when it came... I don't know what kind of politics is going on these days... I really miss his singing.
It&#39;s masters piece song ❤️
When I hear KK's voice and song, I forget that everyone is a different person, I walk in the world, all the singers are on one side and KK is on one side.
If this song has to become a hit then Arijit will give it to Pritam. Vese bhi flop hi pada hai

Everyone wants more of KK and when he gives such beautiful songs then they remain underrated 😭😭

I loved the movie so much that its been almost 1.5years still i can&#39;t get the characters out of my mind

Ye movie original movie ki third class copy hai.Among all songs of this movie , only this one is best just because of KK

<a href="">3:18</a>Main yu tanha jeeta huJaise koi marta.Damn!! KK nailed this line 🔥

They don’t sing like KK, anymore😎

Wat a nice song. Most under rated song. Thanks kk and pritam and entire team.

The day imran hasmi and kk comes together then KK will come back in full flow like old song. M waitin that day ☺️

why has the views of this song has gone down, I am still not able to understand.

KK ❤️ you. From pal to this song kk&#39;s voice is still refreshing,still  many people love to listen his song but we are unfortunate that we are not getting.

This is kk

KK❤❤
I bet no1 can match the range and level of singing with KK ❤

KK is a legend❣

K.K name is enough
If you listening it my friend you have great taste of music 😌

Trust Music Labels used KK instead of all crap singers like Jubin, Darshan, Neha, Tulsi, Dhvani, Yaseer, Badshah, Guru

I don&#39;t know why I get a Very different listening to this song &amp; ye dooriyaan. I can&#39;t explain. I must say lyrics are so apt man. Plus the music composition is so different. And who better than the mesmerizing kk could sing  it.

KK has nailed it as usual... A note of appreciation  for Irshad Kamil too for such beautiful words

Finally said good bye for her better future .. I think I will focus on work now .. got nothing beside work life .. just got to know everything is simply against me .. chalo yeh bhi sahi hai ..

Kk is always underrated💔

Listen to Tu Salamat from the film Mukhbir. The same combination..  Pritam Irshad Kk

everyone says that its ok not to be loved backbut no one talks about how to get over that feeling

Great song given to this bekar movie.

I LOVE MY FAVOURITE SONG

No words to express my feelings when watching the songs of this movie and highway. Specially this song and kaha hoo main from highway.

kk sir aapki jai
Imagine ranvir &amp; deepika/anushka in this song ,,

Yun tera Hona bhi...Aur tanha karta Kk is the best

My fvt hindi song of 2020 and 2021 ❤👈💫
The song gives a fresh &amp; holistic feeling, the tune is so acoustic &amp; large as the mountains &amp; its valleys.

Only those who have had the same experience can truly understand this movie and this song....

I had never listened to this song carefully I used to think &#39;Aur Tanha&#39; looks like some boring old song but someday  when I was listening &#39;Yeh Dooriyaan&#39; of the same album the song strtd i was already feeling empty and as K.K started singing I strtd weeping until the song was not finished. I strtd missing the guy to whom I was missing and i played this song the whole night. Since from that, day i use to listen this song and i really adore the lyrics. I forgot that there are still such beautiful songs in bollywood which we usually ignore and swithc towards Hollywood.

His voice moves your whole soul to another dimension..❤️❤️❤️kk❤️❤️❤️
Absolute love ❤️
The climax of this song is prophet level

Kk forever !!

This song is a gem...Highly underrated. KK&#39;s vocal, Pritam Da&#39;s melody, Irshad saheb&#39;s words &amp; Karthik&#39;s performance ❤I can feel every bit...😒😒

Soulful and peaceful song of 2020 ❤❤❤❤

Kartika soooo hot narmi

My ringtone starts from <a href="">3:51</a>

Only Sony music knows the worth of KK 🙌😍 Huge respect 🙏🙏❤️

So many good singers are there, but KK is my favorite 😊

New Singers Men Woh Feelings Ni Jo KK Sir Ki Voice Men 🙏

The fact is those lyrics belongs to Rafi saab and Kishore da&#39;s era.Our stomach has not yet been able to digest it!

Missing someone 😭

This song deserves its own original video..

Beautiful song 😍✨❤
<a href="">3:05</a> hits different 💓💓💓👍
KK❤️
Don&#39;t know, I felt I&#39;m back in those 90s songs. The song which used to hold meaning and used to infect the heart. I was back in those infectious days. Hit like if you felt the same.

<b>KK</b> should be given more songs... He deserves a lot more.

Ooooo starts and the goosebumps come ❤️

<a href="">3:50</a> wow

<i>They should have added those dialogues.</i>

Whatever movie is there, the heart gets comforted by listening ... The heart itself knows that this song belongs to kk sahab

KK 🔥😭
I&#39;m The Only One Who&#39;s Missing K.K&#39;s Melodious Songs In 2021♥️🥺✨🎶🎻💫
Irshad Kamil + Pritam + KK = Super Duper as always

Every word has a feeling in it....the feeling of true, un-filtered love.Masterpiece by KK.

Kk is god🙏🏻

I waited for this song when the trailer released. It’s such a haunting melody. Simply beautiful. Also the cinematography is so awesome. Two people deliberately drowning themselves in work to keep themselves occupied but unable to fulfill the hollowness inside.

KK&#39;s voice always takes me to my dream-world

Kk is evergreen...
This is the turning point of Kartik Aaryan and breaking of his comic stereotypes . Just keep watching , Kartik will deliver some classic gems . Thanks to Imtiaz Ali , no matter Indian audience often make masterpieces flop . This is another underrated movie . Watch it then you will realise the experiment in music , cinematography , screenplay . This is a strong movie and a complete worthy album!

KkArijitMustafa ZahidAtif  Are the Legendry singers with 0 Hate maybe few people will hate bcz of bad politics
