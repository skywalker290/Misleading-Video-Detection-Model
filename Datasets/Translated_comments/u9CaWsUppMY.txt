How this dumpster fire of a movie featuring mediocre performances, cheesey dialogue and over the top characters ever got made is something I&#39;ll never ever figure out in my lifetime....

Poo is literally Kareena in real life

Nibiya Pappa ki pariAb ye chutiyapa nahi chalta.

She always looks PHAT🔥🔥

came here from Alia&#39;s mimicry from Pinkvilla and realized nobody can actually beat kareena at this , she def nailed it 😂❤

KAREENA💜💜💜💜💜

Karen is evergreen actress

She acts like ms braganzaa from kkhh

I appreciate Kareena&#39;s acting in the whole movie , but the sheer smart boy acting and cool as ever attitude of Hrithik is what made me WOW!!!!

What about body shaming now 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Poo : kiske dubara mudke muze nai dekhaAnswer: Audience.

Only she CLD have done this. Taimoor ki amma

Load of nonsense. And this is supposed to be iconic?

God...this overacting 🤮🤮🤮🤮

Bollywood ka kachara Bollywood sambhal ke rakhe🤮🤮🤮🤮 it&#39;s so cringy when she says hallelujah that I want to puke at her face 😂😂

<a href="">1:19</a> when nobody knew Sigma rule 😎💪♂️

And then this became a classic

Love Hruthik Roshan❤️❤️

Maddy actually copies poo

Poo is the Maddie of Bollywood. Everyone loves her but she has haters.

By far the best character of kareena kapoor She’s the only character of the film that’s is more popular than the film itself

Kareena Kapoor wasn&#39;t acting,she was just being herself in this film.She is really a poo

Thank you waheguru ji

Jai waheguru ji

Pooh is literally my spirit animal hahahahaha!!!

M

Karena was so sexy

Came here after Alia bhatt recreated this scene 😅

ALI AKABR YA NOT ALL IF THAT LILE

Giving minus to indians not justified

The name of the movie?

No one could have played poo better than kareena...... Its so iconic

I love how these indians goes to abroad and speak hindu with everyone and look at them also they understand and can speak hindi better than the indians😆😆😆

If K3G was remade nowwAmitabh ji - Srk maybeeJaya ji - Madhuri mamSrk - RanveerKajol - Anushka for sureHrithik - Tiger maybe for his body igKareena - Alia for sureOkay?

Hrithik attitude and looks are 🔥

Talking to english boys in urdu serms such a foooool idea

Pooh is body shaming a whole generation of men and feminists are loving it! 😁🤣 Imagine if a man does this to a bunch of women? Twitter feminists will be mad for an year over it!

Childhood memories, this movie was a phenomenon , it was crazy back then

When I was a kid I use to enjoy this character poo but I think this is the most stupid and arrogant character and I feel shame for imitating poo in my childhood

😂

O bqri ki said ki huddi knha hai plastic surgery

Minus - overacting ka

این ویدئوخیلی خیلی قشنگه❤💙💚💛💜💓💕💖💗💝💞💟💏💋👸👄👰

Kareena Kapoor is best actress of Bollywood 😅😅😅😅😘😘😘

Tumne dono galat jute phne hai😂😂😂

Kareena is the reason of my weakness 🤕

Honestly she is still vibe 🔥🔥😁😁😁😁😁😁

Poo🤣

😄😄😄😄

Its been years but pooh is still iconic..

Best scene in the movie. lol hilarious

Funny🤣🤣

Lebay

Kareena used to look so different then

Srilanka

<a href="">

Kareena is someone Alia bhatt wishes she was

Hrithik ❤️❤️❤️

<a href="">

Dono dono dono😝😝😝😝🤣

You know the standard of bollywood is trash when one dimensional cringy characters like these are called &quot;iconic&quot;. Everytime I watch these shitshows, My respect for Farhan Akhtar and Dil Chahta Hai increases exponentially.

First they criticize and then they appreciate, specially when you do something hatke! I remember how people labelled her as overacting ki dukan n all when the film came out. The fact that people are still obsessed with her role, says a lot about her work!

<a href="">2:56</a> When you realise that your wearing the wrong pair of heels and your brother tries not to laugh

Actually she was not acting she was living

That sandal 👠part it was too funny 🤣🤣

😄😄😄

My facebook account was blocked and i was at my friend&#39;s place her name is pooja and  we were creating new email address where we were unable to create email address from my name then she said hat tera naam hi panoti hai then finally we created poolubss😂

Kareena is just simply UNBEATABLE in K3G , jab we met and omkara 😍

Most stupid movie ever

I like the reaction of red tshirt guy 😂

I have a doubts do they know hindi

hai kareena kapoor

Sexually Objectifying.

Over acting ki over dose...poooo

who is here after alia as poo

Miss Breganza jaisi hai

Друзья троих, да заплатят. 🔪

The white guys mostly get good ratings, and the 2 brown guys get none 😒

Those days❤️ i studied in class seven then. Reminds me the good old days. Life was so simple.

Indian version of Mean Girl

Pooh all time favorite character 😄💞

Loll😄😄😄👍

Kreena&#39;s body ....how attractive

Prom during college, speaking Hindi people don’t understand it… I love Bollywood movies lol

I also love poo friends yrrr😀

Whose watched again after Alia insta video ??😂😂😂

Kareena is always overacting but she looks so smart. The way she says I like it.I Just really like it.Her voice is Powerful but sweet. I don&#39;t like her acting and her too much atitude but I like the way she presents herself,She express herself I always love her.  The most important thing is she express her happyness I just love it. Thats why I am big fan of kareena.Kareena was my wooman crush since my teenage days. I uesd to style like her. She always inspired me. Her looks, her style, her fashion always inspired me. In her early days she looks so pretty, so gorgeous. I love her earlier beauty. I also loved her earlier Atitude. Undoubtedly she is a talented wooman. After few days she shows over Atitude and she looks rude. But she has thing good that she is not fake. She is good doesn&#39;t preted it.She shows what she is. One thing I like her the most. She is the Best as a friend. Thats shows she is a good human being.Amruta Arora is her Best friend. She is like her family. I think that kareena is a good human being. It doesn&#39;t matter she shows too much attitude. I also love her friendship.She is honest. She is  a loyal wooman.that is the best and the biggest beautiful equality of her.I love her style and fashion.

I like only kareena in this movie. shahrukhs love is good.a family drama wise movie is good. otherwise movie is too long.

Can anyone tell me that which song does Kareena sing in dis whole video😁

When K3G released, most people was taking POO character as an overact. But now we know what kareena did as poo in K3G is remarkable. I can’t think of any of Bollywood actresses is able to get even close to original POO character. 💛

How come there is no one who gets annoyed with the scene and character of poo

ahh Minus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

There is no subtlety

She is imitating archana puran singh&#39;s Miss braganza from Kkhh!! 🤣

♥️♥️💟💟💟

Good looks, good look’s and Good looks

Nice movie

I love the fact how Poo&#39;s friends give exactly the same expression and points to boys 😂😂

Don&#39;t wanna talk about her acting I like kareena alot so no complaints for her but this kinda acting and script and the whole of poo was cringe asf... Bollywood and we ppl were really dumb back then

Lol when she responded ye aaj kal fashion hai shayad tum nai jante for wearing pair of different shoes hahaha that was funny

Red dress is 🔥

Haha how generations goes on poo become more iconic

Cartoon freak ke channel Se aane wale 😂<a href="">1:37</a>😬😬😜😜😜

Foreign me ladkiya mar gyi h kya 😂Ab karan johar ki movies me sivay bakwas ke kuch nahi dikhta 😂😂

I don&#39;t care 🤷if some audience like her or not or say overacting but everyone must agree that she is very talented actress she did a super job and she always rock her character so well  iconic kareena as ever I still remember her bebo character and many more like jab we met

Stylish poo♥️kareena😍😍😍😍😍

my all time fav kareena

Worst role ever, Kareena has copied acting from Archana Puran Singh, she makes same faces, like Archana did in Kuch Kuch hota hai...I wonder who can like this movie and this lame role called POO...

Fabulous acting

Not applicable 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠

She said her saal ki tarah iss saal bhi....how long she is studying in that collage,senior girl behaving like a teenager😂

2.56 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Har saal ki tarah 😂😂😂😂😂

Bruh we were really dumb when we thought that those americans understood hindi …

These people r brainless and make garbage movies

Kareena u made poo word very respectable.

So lovely ❤️🥰🌹🌺

Honestly! It&#39;s iconic and all but if something had to behave like her irl I would think they&#39;re either a Karen or retarded lol 💀 No offense tho I love this movie

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Not pooh speaking hindi in an all eng school😂

Pooja is a name but Poo is an emotion.😁😁😁

When he said - Mujhe kuch kahana hai...I was expecting - ... Wapas mat aana. Still, the shoes were also hilarious

Kareena wasn&#39;t acting here.

❣❣❣❣❣❣😅😅😅😅😅😅

<a href="">00:35</a>...Who wants to go promp with me..🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Ugly acting  such show off

Can&#39;t believe people especially girls calling this most sexist character as the most iconic character. Now just reverse the scene and imagine Hrithik rating women based on looks. Ah  and  the borderline harrasment on Rohan.

Kitni overacting krti h ye..

Dccy

what an overdo...

College. Prom. London. These three things don’t fit. Haha.

<a href="">2:54</a>

Over acting ki dukan

<a href="">0:28</a> three department the guy should be..in movie: good looks good looks and good looksbut real kareena choose: Money, money and only money..

Background music 🤣🤣🤣

Ufff such a behanji accent, slum make-up &amp; that Bongi acting. Kareena Kapoor definitely  deserves a score of 2 but minus.

Oh my God the comments also got thousands likes..

Uis

Jdjs

Mujhe wo din yaad hai, Kareena kitni flop thi, sirf uski behn Krishna ki wajah se log use jaante the... Aadmi jese dikhne wali ye aurat akhirkar logo k sath so ker famous ho hi gyi

Wah Poo is trending now too 😍💫

Ketna over acting karti he na

🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂red shoos 😆😆😂🤣🤣🤣

Hello Pooja Rani Hai Main how are you Pooja

Hrithik Roshan 🔥🔥

Iss pooti movie mein kareena nay bilkul karan johar  jaisi harkatein ki hein bas

For a moment I thought  the guy came in hrithik&#39;s house to take poo was Karan Johar by seeing him side view😄🤔

Kareena Kapoor in BollyWood version of Mean GirlsThat entrance down the stairs in Red = 🔥🔥🔥 And then...Non matching heels 👠👡🤣🤣🤣

This was epic

Iconic

Good

Funniest thing is how all the girls besides Karina are proper munters

I wish talented Rani Mukherjee could have played a larger role in this movie 😟😟😟 remember her entry in kuch kuch hota hai.who agrees?

God in 2000 I went to reading college .but never heard all whites are asian speak in hindi..specially in college or university...lol

Very beautiful

I love karina

🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂 yaar ye kareena bhi acchi comedy karti hai maza agaya

I like it 😂😂 my favorite part ❤️😂

Pooh and geet are  the most iconic characters of bollywood.

This is literally one of the most entertaining Bollywood characters every played. Who doesn’t remember ever scene and dialogue with her as Pooh? Pure over the top comedy. It was absolutely ridiculous too because nobody has prom in college and none of the non desis would know what she was saying.  The ten fans going which only blow in the actress’s direction. The odd plastic clothes. 0% realism but 100% comedy 90’s style. Oh and can we please give respect to those flawless abs? She must have been training nonstop for it. Gotta love it. They should do a sequel.
