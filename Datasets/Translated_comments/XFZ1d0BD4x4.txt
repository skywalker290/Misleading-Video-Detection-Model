Remembered sarika mam from 2018 today seeeing this in 2023....good 10 th days...

The clock looks modern

She was very intelligent but a con artist

Movie name?
amazing perfomance of vidya

Bsdk, I never even thought of anyone who would use the song, making everyone like it.
Math is my favourite subject 

This is God gifted talent, I believe in God . I don&#39;t like Shakuntala&#39;s life  because she has done nothing in mathematics atleast she should do some research in the place of showing in shows

Over acting overload

how did she know that boy&#39;s name is akshay

If we got the the teachers like her in school our childhood would have more  fun and intresting

Would attend every class of such a hot teacher

I miss my maths teacher
She deserve national award for this ...

Kash hamre bhi maths ke ase hi teacher mile

<a href="">

We also expect like these teachers in schools for maths

Prime is best

Mathsphobic person like me... Are watching movie of &quot;Shakuntala Devi&quot; 
She&#39;s super cool

Thank god it was deleted. And Thank god it is uploaded on YT 

Love and respect to human computer ️️

This isn&#39;t a deleted scene ,it is the last scene

Ruined.

why they have deleted this scene ? 

Thori Na Mach will come to the children of class 4-5
I had a maths teacher like this last year she was super cool she solved all our doubts and. Had a great amount of patience the subject I hated the most became my fav and because of her help I topped in maths

Lol, I thought somewhere she would answer the question the kid asked.. Of course maths has rules.

Vidya Balan Mam is such an exemplary actress

Ok so why 1+1 is not 4?

Why this scene was deleted?

Every reacher must follow this method n first of all encourage students so that they would become great n never forget his or her teacher n will always pray for teacher.

Good scene.. Why it was deleted?

Best Maths Teacher.

and lala and lala...
Please stop making fun of Bengalis.. bollywood only can bring these type of discrimination while making a movie on such an intellectual subject

<a href="">  all about the legend Shakuntala Devi

Overacting

So sad from Vidya Balan ,teach acting course ,

Shakuntala devi the greatest mathematician of all times

How did you find his name?
I used to hate vidya. But after watching the dirty picture, I have a different kind of respect for her. She a gem in the whole film industry. Both her performance and looks are killer.

We want this type of teacher 

Every maths teacher should be friendly...hope

Name of the movie ?

I don&#39;t know about my maths teacher but my hindi teacher is like this

I have come here to follow BODMAS rule 
Her smile is like Parineeti Chopra

Excellent film.......
X

my maths teacher is too bad too teach she sometimes keep her mouth shut there is online class

So cute

i knowed about shakunthala devi after seeing this movie

Biology master is made so dumb to make a maths teacher smart. It was unnecessary. Director should have been a bit more creative.. good that this scene is not in the movie

We have to make other characters dumb to make the main one cool?

She still didn&#39;t answer &quot;1+1 = 4 ho sakta hai kya?&quot;

<a href="">

pull my 1 eyes

Gorgeous 

Wow, this is almost my style to teach

wa

Overactor

This was shown

This wasn&#39;t deleted fools

Have you noticed the change in &quot;BODMAS&quot; (On the blackboard)!!!???

It feels like I am in school

It's good that this scene has been removed...this overacting suit does not apply to Vidya and also to the film.
She was role model up to flims like paa, munna bhai,  later her graph came down crashing after dirty pictures.

and then there is my maths teacher who says to ask questions and when we ask a question they shout at us

Mathematics teacher from west bengal ️️

Vidhya....ur awesome.....

Did anyone noticed  that  watch on the top it is  a new piece even I have that at my home.

Maths
Who is sitting at the table, friend?
I need this movie in tamil dubbed version

This bitch is following our teacher's path 
Deep inside We all wish that we had a math teacher like her!

Incredible performance by Vidya Balan As Shakuntala devi!
Wow...vidya ji

As a teacher we are not allowed to sit on the table in front of the students. May be for this reason this scene was deleted.

Did any one observed in BODMAS he said O for order but that is Of

I wish Shakuntala Devi was my Mathematics teacher.  Then I would&#39;ve been the topper in Maths not in class.

This is a movie of Lawda 
Vidhya balan is best than sharukhan

I love this movie a lot and you know that it is in real search on google shakuntala devi i have also search un real she solve very very big digits

If you do not support the religion then you may watch a movie but will not watch it...everyone is riding on a horse.
This article should be uploaded on MX Player so that it does not cost any subscription money.
Love her voluptuous body.
Why did I do this scene and why did I sit on the teacher's table..Jo agree, I like it
Which teacher sits on the desk in front of the principal and throws somthing towarsa the student?

Boycott bollywood

Chutiyaaaaaaaaa vidya balan
Even in 3rd standard i would feel cringe if some teacher talks this cheesy... Teaching in a intresting way is different from taking classes from dora the explorer

Overacting

She didn&#39;t answer the child questions though @1:98

I AM GOING TO BE SHAKUNTALA DEVI
Save money for the future

Boycott her

My holiness if I got that kind of maths teacher who should teach by Heart not from books

She was great &amp; fastest human calculator in that era... She wasn&#39;t a mathematician. There is a lot of difference between mathematician &amp; human calculator.

As an teacher you can&#39;t seat on desk in front of students like she seats.

Sorry but vidhya ki acting bilkul kharaab thi isme....plus the face makeup was very bad.

This Scan hardly osm better for this video I liked it<a href="">

Your role stop then to try other carector role amaze in side power full actor

its not a deleted scene i have seen it

So much overacting 

Binod

She always gets good publicity  thanks to big banners backing her  even though very average or over acting but that is enough for indian stnd.

Good, this scene was deleted. Not entertaining.

ovaracting of vidya balan

I love vidya Versatile actor and she is so so beautiful ️ she struggle so hard for what she is today

Batoore balan 

Vidya bhalan stans here
According to shakunthala devis look and sound mayoori sudha chandran resembles best ..

She is a verstile actress.

Hiiiii️️️️️️️
Why did you delete the nice scene?
Super

Over acting

Shakuntala devi is not a mathematical genius she is a numerical specialist. She was expert in fast calculation of addition, substraction, multiplication and division of numbers and nothing else. Mathematics is a huge world of many more things including these basic operations. It is wrong to call her as mathematician, but the great Shrinivasa Ramanujan was a mathematician, no doubt about it. Shakuntala devi was a genius on numbers.

Yeh movie toh mast lagega...

Ye kya role ki thi nonsense type shakuntala devi ka inteligent mind show krne k bazay ise bol aurat jo kisi ki parwah ni krti usko jyada focus kiya gya

Vidhya is overacting ..shakuntala devi was a humble woman  ..she never showed off

i wish my maths teacher is shakuntala devi

One thing of Indian School that nobody can reform: &quot;gooooood moooooornig sirrrrrr&quot;I am also a student and my class also do so even whole school do so Teachers are done by telling that you don&#39;t have to sing you just have wish straight forward but students still: &quot;gooooood moooooornig sirrrrrr&quot;

Vidhya is overacting.

What if he writes Binod instead of BODMAS

Shakuntala Devi was not a mathematician stop representing her as a one

Please transfer into Tamil

So watch on amazon prime you won’t miss scenes this is not deleted

Teacher is Arnab

sorry️
Her body gives her chances in odd roles in films other than bollywood girls

Binod

Maths is my best friend 

This scene was deleted because of the bakwaas mathematics rule BODMASye BODMAS nahi BADMASSH rule hai

Jab tak samajh aaye fun nahi aaye to bakwas like of you relate 

Stupid scene : 1) Is she a gunda to jump over the table to make her seated. A teacher should show a minimum decency  and be aware where to sit and how to sit properly                           2)  The guy behind her , supposed to be the teacher, raised his hand in response to her question.... What a fool he is .... He is mocking the whole teacher community through this single foolish action

Why Bollywood does Overacting and makes a mess of every good character.

Dislike for Vidya who support drug activities



What is this overacting?
The Dirty picture wali feeling aa rahi hai
This scene is said to be like nothing from the movie.
Shameful! Vidya, I don’t understand people like you who openly support prime accused while defaming or remaining silent on Sushant and his family. Sushant is dead. I repeat Sushant is DEAD. Someone’s son, someone’s brother was murdered. A life lost. And he was from your film “fraternity”. And not ONE word in support of the dead?! Who supports drug peddlers over a man that rose to great fame and had great aspirations for himself and his country? Shameful Vidya Balan!

I wish we also had such a teacher.
The bollywood movies based on true event , all are fantacy updated , it&#39;s all hyper exaggerated

Why my maths teacher was not like her 

Why this scene got deleted?? Let me guess by the laws of copywood : ees scene mei koyi hot scene nahi haii

<a href="">

The teacher was looking like arnab     ghoswami

We should respect vidhya balan for her acting

Shakunthala devi is lagend

It&#39;s after the song then deleted scene  how is that possible this scene looks good but deleted hmm 

Vidya is not doing justice to Shakuntala&#39;s character. As far as I remember, she was a solemn lady here she is trying to be jovial.

Binod

Who cares just look at her how cute she is

ending was that good...was expecting a better ending

When I see Vidya Balan in this biopic I always remember Dirty Picture I don&#39;t know may she was portrayed in this biopic not like Shakuntala Devi how she actually is in real life. Please Amazon Prime make another biopic of her along the lines of Radioactive (Marie Curie&#39;s biopic).

This scene was not deleted it&#39;s in the end after the movie is finished.

Best of luck for JEE &amp; NEET

Butiful movi and vidhya balan actiing  speech less original acting

Vidhya balan is no where around shakuntala devi..... Infact I can&#39;t get a single vibe of shakuntala devi from her in this.... Trailer

Akshay's answer was not given.
I dont you why but i dont like vidya balan 
Don&#39;t start searching for 1+1= 4...

For one sec it felt like he was writing BINOD...

Literally 1 % people who are reading......May you parents live happily healthily for more then  years️️

these serials always abuse south indians and bengalis and non-hindi people, shakuntala devi never spoke hindi, hindi people think they are the keeper of our destiny, which is not, they have very little contribution in the nation building apart from joining in army, most of the scientists are from bengal, south etc

Let's do the right thing and delete it
It would be great if she proved 1=4.

Whatever role Vidya Balan plays, she looks like Vidya Balan. She is unable to get into the character.
Over acting

There is many thing to learn from this movie.

1+1 4 ho Sakta hai Twins paida hua tho

She is doing overacting

&quot;BINODMAS&quot; B̶O̶D̶M̶A̶S̶
entire movie should be deleted, this movie is an insult to the great lady

Kya Sach me sakunthala devi maths malu kya

Binod

Kash meri maths teacher ESI Hoti

Overacting

Mom didn't tell me why 1+1=4 didn't happen.
who have Amazon fire TV stick hit like and woh dont have dislike

<a href="">1:05</a> is the deleted sence The way of her sitting on the table

I like shakuntala devi
Body language ... tremendous
I wish my maths teacher wws like this I hate my maths teacher 

Boycott Aditya Roy Kapoor

Ye deleted scene kaise hua? Ye song last me Dikhaya tha, last ki numbering me

<a href="">

Over acting

It is a bad habit of sitting a teacher on the table. It will create a bad opinion on the person

What do you mean there are no rules? Such stupidity. She would have never said it. Trash film

Very nice movie everyone should watch in my opinion... and we want many more Shakunthala  Devi from India to make India proud

Kash Shakuntla devi jaisi Maths ki teacher mujhe bhi mili hoti Kya kisiko apni life mei  aisi teacher mili?

If Shakuntala Devi came to teach me Math, still I would remain dull in Mathematics. In this birth, Math is just impossible to me.

What an acting ! Only she can do that.

Ye class kb over hogi ye madam class se kb se jayegi ye calculate karna bhi to maths...
By seeing this...I think a teacher must be like  very friendly with students 

Justice for pinku Kumar 
It was not deleted

Lock down me school nai kholne so

Heart touching scene old school memories recall

Another superhit film by Vidya Balan! Similarly, if she keeps doing biopics, then one day people will call her &quot;Biopic Balan&quot; Will start speaking!!!
I have never seen a class room like this , when a teacher is inside the class room, all stupid directors show teachers as comedian or as immatured person. Stop these kind of nonsense here after.

I thought you are writing binod

sooo funny

<a href="">

I thaught it was BINOD.Great Movie. Vidya is best.<a href="">

My geometry teacher was hitler incarnate , she was albino skinned which gave off  peculiar aura, she used to say quick ( Kwik) like (Kwuk) on top of making us stand outside the class as punishment she used to pinch our bellies real hard until she heard us squirm .

School life and the memory was awesome than any other memories See and change your life % guarantee <a href="">

The movie is fun might be her best movie

I won&#39;t watch this for CBi inquiry and justice for SSR for me its a total boycott of Bollywood.

Why she didn&#39;t answer 1 +1 can be 4 Anyone?..... Me :

cam you put the scene in the movie

Sorry to say But the best tribute to the great Shakuntala Devi Ji is not to watch this movie

<a href="">

Aisi agar teacher ho toh maja aa jaye

It would have been better if they introduced the Amy of Malayalam

Nice concept

Such a nice and encouraging scene is this.... With entertainment too..... This scene should not be deleted from movie.. 

Who Knows Carryminati

When you know calculus is also their ...your maths confidence get intowhat I do now

But why itni overacting..?

I can&#39;t stop adoring this amazing actress, charming smile, different projects .no need to be skinny...no need of nuidity, no need of short dress... always sooper

Don&#39;t financing these bollywood mafias movie who didn&#39;t say anything about SSR

BINOD

Binod

Teacher was looking like Arnab Goswami ..

randi ki bchi vidya balan
Her acting peeks... Especially that laugh

VIDYA BINOD TILL 2015

She is such a phenomenal actress just love her act always 

I have seen this movie 3 to 4 times Vidya kasam 

A choreographed class room scene.. Still this is what they could come up with ??

Nahi chale gi ye Film
..

Why was this scene deleted?

Wow superb acting 
I thought he was writing binod

Who saw shakuntala Devi movie and shocked by the fastest maths hit like And who liked the movie comment

Is the teacher Arnab Goswami?

Binod

Why the clock get stuck at 9 ?!?

how she knows that his name is akshay?

Sushant Singh Rajput fans ,see &quot;Hypocrite Bollywood&quot;  showing their movies by titles of Deleted Scenes.Bycott Bollywood.Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput 

Seeing her body language it looks like Dirty picture sequel .. does not justify the role of mathematician Shakuntaladevi

Osm movie

Badhia scene why deleted

As a student I liked it very much

Vidya balan is just too good

Ohh Arnab Goswami had a guest role
But she didnt replied the student&#39;s question ,   that can we write 1+1=4?

Sakuntala Devi is extraordinary. I am excited.

Why was this scene deleted??

This shouldn&#39;t be deleted

A maths teacher like this is just imaginary for me

Amazon prime video India:- Deleted scene of Shakuntla Devi Me:- If you people upload this on YT then what is the use of deleteting that scene 

Hi mam I like your every move love you <a href="">#tamangskitchen</a>



She is really genius by born<a href="">#mathslearningcenter</a>

Why this much overacting

I think ,Vidya Balan Mam should get an oscar award for acting in this filmAnd Skunthala Devi mam should get a Nobel prize for her intelligence and contribution. A great salute to both!

I don't know why my brother is here.
This scene is not deleted it was in the song in the end of the movie

Who dont like Maths
Wow, Sunne is enjoying the magic of Maths. I wish I could do some more magic of Maths.
And stupid people say fat woman are not beautiful ! Look at Vidya she is shine like diomond 

Binod

when the started l felt he was writing BINOD on the blackboard

Good scene

AMAZING

She was from karnataka she was spoke only kannada and english not hindi fulish Bollywood

I was thinking he was writing binod on the blackboard 

Vidya Balan is so dedicated, that she perfectly has Shakuntala&#39;s body language

Except my maths teacher... All teacher teach in my school like her...

I have watched the movie  very interesting those who like the movie plz like 

Good

<a href="">

If it was a hot scene.. they would not have deleted! Why do they cut such amazing scenes?

Shakuntala Devi was a human computer, She can solve any big or small question without pan and paper.

Wow

we expect these type of scenes in movie instead of scenes with her daughter and personal matter. her skills are inspiring...

Kirron Kher would have nailed the role instead of Vidya

Wow what a scene

Remember sushanth

Amazing
This horrible to delete such a beautiful scene... Great vidya ji... Ur acting... No sorry u r living as sakunthala mam

Good

Can you please show deleted “stories” as well

She is 
Questioning is MATH....well said by shakuntala devi.........

Love vidya balan. So much positive energy. I loved her in this role

Was really Shakuntala Devi Joyful with excitement as shown here

Sakauntala Devi : THE HUMAN COMPUTER FROM INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳️  <a href="">
Chutya hai Bollywood k log instead of showing her intelligence they focused on something less important, being intelligent in india is joke,bwood is shitzy, seriously she was so brilliant and smart and out of the world instead of focusing on her talent this bwood pathetic people ruined her image, people around the world they show the positive side of their inteligent people like Einstein, maxwell, bohrs, Curie, bwood ek number ka madarchod hai nobody might have even heard about her before because women can&#39;t survive male dominant society of India, pathetic!!!!!!!!

Superb

Wish Vidya Balan can make justice to this legend

Now Bollywood has adopted new strategy.... They r hiding nepotism in blanket of patriotism...

Please upload more deleted scenes
Nice
This is a new trend of making biographies  Which is welcomed ️

her acting was wonderful

If all the teachers were like the teacher in the film,  then school going will be more fun. After all,  exams should be ended for making schools the happiest place in the world.

I wish I had maths.

BINOD

Caricaturish representation of Lt. Shakuntala Devi. Now bollywood has also forgotten how to represent a particular person in his/her best possible manner.

What a energy shown by Vidya valan in the character...... It&#39;s like real

<a href="">#justiceforssr</a>

Wow this scene reminds me about my science teacher kamalam nair mam of kv meenambakkam chennai. Her way of teaching was always very fun and none of the students failed. She passed away last year. Rest in peace mam. Will always love u for ever.

That maths teacher was resembling arnav goswami right?

<a href="">1:54</a> The curious child askes question but the male class teacher doesn&#39;t answer his questions and than scolds him.Due to this type of teachers the students start hating them and their subject. This thing is reality in most of the school in india.We need to change this.

But, why was this scene deleted from the movie

vidya sexy
Ab Bhai Dekho shakunatal Devi ko maths aati thi jab se vo paisa hui thi tab se ye god gifted hai ab Bhai hum logo ko to itni maths aati Nahi hai jitni aati hai utna paper me karte hai aur vaise bhi humare zamane me ab shakunatal Devi to hai nahi Jo hame maths sikha dengi..the students whom she taught maths were Very lucky I am jealous of them

Why is everyone saying Binod in the comments.... I don&#39;t understand..

I thaught he would write BINOD at beginning on board

<a href=""> song 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 
but the question still remains that can 1+1=4??? if  their are no rules in math

When i saw bo i thought its binod

Our Indian Government Should Consider Sakuntala Devi&#39;s Work And Recognize Her With Prestigious Award  This Gesture Help India And It&#39;s Future We As A Country  Have To Recognize Gems Of Our Land And Spread Them And There Work With Our Future Generation It&#39;s Possible Only Adding Them In Our Text Books<a href=""> href=""> href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> <a href=""> href="">

Overacting has been done.
Bollywood Ab sirf biopic aur remake ke bharose hai

Instead of teaching students &quot;Not to abuse&quot;. We are teaching them &#39;How to abuse in mathematics&#39;.It&#39;s time to rethink about &quot;Where we are leading our next generation&quot;.

agr aise mam childhood main milti to aj kismat kuch aur hota

This is how children should be taught by encouraging them

these are ditto my lines...which are going in my mind...I love mathsI am <a href="">#MATHSDIVANI</a>

why? why this much overacting?this movie can be made with great compassion.

This scene should be in movie

Why it&#39;s deleted???? it&#39;s should be in the movie

Good movie
overacting!!

In the starting I thought he was writing BINOD

She is so original

बक्वास 
Devi ji will subtract from the question of 1+1=4..
Why!

Binod

I enjoyed this very much i was thinking that i wish could be a student of that classroom 

I am seeing deleted scenes as if i have had seen the entire movie already

If only I had Shakuntala Devi in ​​my school and I would show interest in maths.
Vidya balan did very well played her character
Badly want to watch

First of all, tell me how this school is running, how are you keeping so many children, how are you giving us the children, that too on the day of guest inspection.
Vidya balan super acting
Binod <a href="">#justiceforsushant</a>

at <a href="">2:16</a> how did she knew that the boy&#39;s name is &quot;AKSHAY&quot;

It seems promo video more than a deleted scene...

I want this movie in english

I was waiting for the answer to the questionNo rules then Why 1 +1 =4But y?

Kas,  hme bhi asa teacher mila hota.

Too much overacting..

Vidya Balan had the crappiest acting in this movie

When he writes B suddenly my mind answer Binod 

The answer given was no.
Binod

Nice movie Really appreciate vidhya acting skill

Binode

The whole movie should have been a big deleted scene

This was not supposed to be deleted

The best scene...️Love u Vidya Balan

They should add this in movie for those teacher who teaches maths badly to kids

Overacting...

her expression was the best at <a href="">0:48</a>

Who thought he is going to write Binod

This scene was deleted because sharing lunch is not allowed due to corona

acha hua dlt kar diya...scene was not suitable.....

Legendary ShakuntalaLegendary Vidya

LOLLOLOLOL

Did anyone notice Vidya&#39;s funny face in 0.49 !?

Why does the teacher looks arnub goswami tho

The teacher looks like Arnab Goswami 

It&#39;s a very nice scene , wonder why the makers couldn&#39;t include it .

Overacting is se jyada koi nhi kar sakta

She said maths m koi rule nhi hota h.. so why she couldn&#39;t reply 1+1=4 is not possible

It's a good thing this scene was deleted.
B FOR BINOD 

This scene should have been included.

Kash. Humahi mathematics teacher aise tohi......

Binod

The scene of sharing the lunchbox was so cute...i just remembered by school days

Bengalis  watching  and thinking about the word  bodmas   origin

Awesome movie

What schools be if maths teacher was like Vidya Balan

Why did you delete this, it was looking bad and it was not enough for motivation in the whole movie.
Sorry guys mazak mein kiya tha yr.. But it was not funny

it's a stupid movie
I Don&#39;t Know Why This Scene is cut 

Wait....Unhone tho jawab hi nhi DiyaKya 1+1=4 ho hai??
Lovely️️️
She was the MatheMagician not Mathematician!!!...Although we&#39;ve lost a precious gem but there exists one more diamond in Kerala who is just similar to Shakuntala Devi... I forgot his name but you can find him out in one of the episodes of &quot;OMG::Yeh Mera India&quot;!!!...

I      l   i   k   e         i   t   !   !   !   !
What is this BINOD thing going on? Can someone please explain?

each time i am watching the trailer or any part of the movie i am falling for VIDYA mams acting.

How many of you observed that the clock is not working? Stopped at 9.02

Why this awesome scene got deleted???? Thanks for uploading here...

Shakuntala Devi Movie Vs Original : <a href=""> watch this video of shakuntala devi in different roles, both original and movie

I think prime video also has their mathematician to calculate and put a video and series at specific time so they got maximum viewers 

Her acting is inspirational 
Salute for mam️<a href="">
Lowest common denominator??seriously??
I think they deleted this scene to delete that song.

Her acting skills are awesome

Amazon prime proved 1 as prime number Luv u &lt;3
Thank God this shit was cut

Initially i thought he is writing binod..

This is a disgusting film. Did not do any justice to Shakuntala Devi&#39;s life. So sad. So much a disgrace. Only Vidya Balan was good.

I saw B in thumbnail so I thought he&#39;s going to write Binod 

this scene shouldn&#39;t have been cut from the movie...... movie mea hota ye scene tho bahut acha lagta

Such a nice scene of the heart
Exelent mind
Maths God shakuntali devi
