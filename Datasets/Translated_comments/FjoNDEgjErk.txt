Who are you siding with here: Tyrese or The Rock?

<b>Tyrese is a good singer</b>But the boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy CAN NOT ACT !!!!! Sad though, he&#39;s been in the industry for a very long time.

DJ is so full of himself and thinks everything revolves around him.

Tyrese my friend you&#39;re absolutely right!

I watched Hobb&amp;Shaw for IdrisNot Dwayne and I can confirm many women did the same lol

I like FF without the Rock.   End

Wasn’t 2 Fast 2 Furious a Brian spin-off though? Since no original characters were in that film besides Brian?

Not cool Rock . Tyrese is the best. 

Dwayne Johnson was a rising star in the movie industry before he was in Fast &amp; Furious. He had already starred in Walking Tall, The Rundown, The Scorpion King, and Doom and was continuing to grow as an actor. The only thing the Fast and Furious movie did for Dwayne Johnson was to show that Dominic Toretto could get hit with a pipe wrench from a guy obviously who&#39;s obviously bigger and stronger and not be phased because Dominic Toretto is obviously super human. Fast and Furious did little for Dwayne Johnson.

Dwayne rock Johnson can&#39;t handle more than one alpha on the set that is the problem he wants to be the main alpha well tough s*** your candy a** 

Now he&#39;s the &quot;CROCK&quot; of shit

He is an entitled brat..

Tyrese: Better hide your baby oilRock: Better hide that big ass forehead

Vin diesel and tyrese are deluisional; lost in their onnscreen characters. These guys beefing like its a real family break up. Its just a job. If you dont have the pull to successfully sell a standalone side movie, then dont hate on others who can.

The truth is Vin and Tyrese are Christians and Dwayne is not. That caused a lot of on set tension

The rock has a fragile Ego.

Dwayne Johnson trying to take over DC movies turned out horribly

Jeez This Blew My Mind Just Him Having Beef With Tyrese

And he&#39;s the lawnmower man.ha

tyrese got mad at dwayne for doing a spin off but jason did the same movie and is not in fast x, bro just hates dwayne 

This aged very well...

The Rock had a feud with Vin Diesel and Tyrese too…That’s how you realize he is the problem

Hobbs and shaw seemed like his way of taking advantage of the franchise, and trying to steal the &quot;family&quot; theme. Funny cause he claimed Vin was taking advantage of the franchise too.

Last one I saw was fast six and that was pushing it street racing was where it started man smh this is a let down

better hide that baby oil

Its unfortunate they had a falling out because i like them both. I personally like spin-offs. Yes the wholr cast to the OG may not be in the spin-off but its still part of the whole story and it keeps the franchise alive. I wish all the cast members had a spin-off.

After all the info about Shazam and Dwayne forcing his own crappy movie (I thought black Adam was alright BUT it didn’t need to happen, black Adam is literally shazams arch nemesis) it makes sense that he would be a colossal dick on fast sets and cause issues with other actors. Tyrese makes a good point, there were never issues with the fast cast until dwayne showed up.

Get the Diaz brothers on him LMAO!

&quot;FAMILY&quot;...........

Would sooner see tyrese on screen with the franchise, rather than dwayne, after Tokyo drift the quality just dropped

what a stupid feud.

I enjoyed this , very informative 

Don’t like the rock

Dwayne Johnson has beef with everyone, jeez

I wish Igaf.

I wish Tyrese would&#39;ve been the choice for BLACK PANTHER.

Paul love you brother miss you like my own mate ride or die bless you xxxxxxxxx

Guys fast and furious movie is long dead..  The amount of action they put those new movies.  At make Indian boloweed actions nothing..   It&#39;s so bad

At least Tyrese reach back to his grass roots unlike the Rock with wrestling 

Yea... I can never watch these movies without paul walker. It has his and vin diesels franchise together. But mostly Pauls. He was the driving force of the entire franchise.I stop at 7, cause the rest doesnt feel the same. and the stories have been getting to out of left field. Here two actors that came onto a franchise that wasnt theirs, and they are making it about themselves. When this franchise should of ended on a high note. Paul walkers death, was the end of old hollywood. And it should of been the END of the FF franchise. Anything else feels like disrespect to his legacy.

Classic Ali &amp; Frazier bantering beef that keeps the audience intrigued by what is said next

After Watch Ant MenConfuse What They say Is Not GoodBec I Not Watch YetBut I hope Watch Again Avenger Infinity And Avenger End GamesBec Is Continue But Short Time........That What I HATETo Short Time......2 Hour 30 Minute Not Enough

Sadly, The whole Fast franchise became a piece of crap without The Rock. Tyrese really need to shut his mouth, just look at his career.

When will people realise that the rock is a bully

Fast and the furious died when they became this save the world government for hires. Like dude. Y’all failed. When Walker died it was like fuck it let’s sell out. The entire cast is a bunch of sell outs. If I was Walker I’d roll over in my grave. If Money comes between you and fam y’all were never blood.

i love the hobs and Shaw kind of fell off and no one really remembers it when talking about fast and the furious

They to talented  and rich for this bs   stop it live and let live it more important things In the world acting like  knocked  heads beefing  .

Tyrese was right about this Bald Wrestler

The rock is useless. The old fast and furious movies had more of a relation to the movie title. Then here comes the fraternal boule ritual boy the rock to switch it to some irrelevant junk crap that only got paid well cause the rock and other actors are all illuminati fraternal clowns who are favored immorally within a circle of occult agenda for fame

I am with Tyrese Gibson of course. The Rock joined this franchise with 5th Movie while Tyrese was like a creator of the Franchise. The rock should respect what He says. And since Paul Walker passed away, The Fast and Furious franchise used like a sheep to squeeze out some money. They did not respect the memory of Paul Walker. If Paul was here he wouldn&#39;t let this happen. The Rock can go make his own action movies. The fast and furious is a different kind of thing bros.

Hobbs and shaw wasn’t that good honestly

The moment Paul left us I didn&#39;t watch any fast and furious anymore fr no cap.RIP Paul

Tyrese was right tho.

This franchise lost me after the charger flipped.

Sources says, it&#39;s all because Tyrese didn&#39;t hide his big ass forehead.

I wish they would squash the beef

Tyrese is a shady , inferior, color complex havin, chump made dude.

Why can&#39;t they just fight it out and hug it out

The rock did ruin the franchise honestly.

Better hide dat big ahh forehead!

I honestly thought that it was due to the improv forehead line from fast 6

Jealousy is real

Ending lines…..<a href="">#Super</a> <a href="">#Maaa</a>

The Rock

Funny how much these people d!ck ride, seeing how it worked out in the end

So the rock was in the bad ...now that I heard this and I&#39;m actually thinking about it does look shady from the rocks side cuz after he arrived on the fast&amp;f franchise u know it was like ok another good character added to the franchise but I guess they offered him a new completely set of money with just him and the other guy (characters name shawn?) But instead of him working with the others he did it solo mode possible ending the family franchise and also getting all the bread to him self on that movie and this is ehat he saw in eyes of tyrese (that is what he didn&#39;t like )

The first 3 fast movies were great. They started losing reality after that. Now it’s all special effects: ie jumping out of planes, matrix shit, and lunacy. They lost it after Tokyo Drift. Bring back the more realistic versions and I’ll actually watch them

i like Tyrese but the Rock is Arguably THE biggest box office draw in the world and i may be wrong but i dont think most studios, companies etc are gunna take Tyrese over the rock.

They were beefing because he roasted tyrese’s big ass forehead

He has always been a piece of s*** having five-and-a-half kids and never paying child support not even acknowledging them

Without Paul walker fast furious never been the same and the rock had too much ego

Fast and furious ended after Tokyo drift after that it was just mission impossible with cars

The Rock wanted Fast and Furious to be about him. F&amp;F is about cars and family. F&amp;F7 was the last.... The Rock is just disrespectful.

I agree with Tyrese but he shouldn’t be doing a public argument keep that private

When paul was around it was quality over quantity when he left it became quantity over quality.

Tyrese

What ..didnt become  a star before fast hahahahahahahahahahajahaha..THE rock killed it before that liar

Look the rock is cool and all but the person that made Hobbs and shaw a movie to watch was Jason Statham. You could insert any one else as Hobbs in all those movies.

Hobbs and Show got to much fiction 100% out of reality

Was too old and too educated when this series came out to be fan.  But Tyrese looks bad in this feud.

Tyrese is a small actor who make a living  via fast and furious while whatever movie the rock makes is an automatic box office hit .

Shame on Tyrese to think that FF is a good franchise. I mean it&#39;s ok.. I guess but taking shots at DJs other films like FF earned a Oscar  &amp; thinking DJ would hurt without it. Tyrese went out sad. This was a funny time  it still is

Family  that&#39;s why I&#39;m here  I agree, us against the world 

This is hilarious I thought it was just Tyrese doing one of those fake YouTube post again but considering Tyrese&#39;s the only one saying anything about it he must just have some hurt feelings

I like it all together rather it’s saving the world or just RACING , every movie &amp; character is amazing!!!

two words to describe The Fast And Furious Franchise... Family and Coronas

youtube taylor made holiday special very funny Subscribe and like Its all for family Thank you God bless

The rock did ruin the the whole franchise

that&#39;s because tyrese is always yelling on Dwayne XD

This is so stupid. The second movie didn’t have the whole cast in it either, but Tyrese was. Those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones…. Or…. Rocks.

The Rock has 10 films lined up every year, but Tyrese only gets offers for Fast and Furious sequels... That&#39;s why he is salty AF

Literally everyone in these feuds are egotistical rich people. Both this one and the Vin/Rock feud as well.

Tyrese is jealous. No spinoff was made from his character. If given the opportunity, I think Tyrese would have done it too!

It was and still is a crap movie/franchise. A bunch of drag racers turned action stars who throw down with special ops peeps. What a bunch of crap

The rock comments was kinda racist about the name of his album...I liked him but not sure anymore

So who’s back here after finding out Dwayne refused to come back for fast 10 after Vin Diesel basically begged him?

Tyrese beefed with genuine too!He beefed with baby mama!HE BEEFED WITH MISTER ROGERS 

F&amp;f  starts  as a car racing based  movie and ended up to mission impossible.  It&#39;s crazy how cool was f&amp;f cars are before , today those cars are the real icons of this francise

LOL!! have to laugh, the only person that is and will always be perfect that was in the flesh is JESUS!, show me one person on this earth or universe that have never had a disagreement or fallen out especially family that is life the only difference is this is made public, some ppl have bears, tiger oh my dinosaur bones  hidden,  it&#39;s life they&#39;ll  be aaalllright they making buckoo $$$ regardless they be just fine, and you never know could be a move to make the movie bigger, negativity sells, this is the kind of world we live in

Cool movie but that last fight scene with all the Samoans was wack as fuck lol

Lies

THE MAN is dead, and All of You suck!

I love what you do

Probably because of Tyrese&#39;s big ass forehead

All I get it is The Rock being a douche

Actors are the loudest drama queen&#39;s holy shit

I personally believe that Tyrese is a little bit jealous of The Rock. Just look at the popularity and success of both of them. Tyrese success pails in comparison to The Rock, although both of them are very successful. I can see why Tyrese was mad, it seemed like The rock was going to take the success of all the Fast and furious actors and focus it all on himself. The rock made a spinoff and tried creating new fan bases for himself from the fast and furious series. Imagine, Tyrese and Vin, and the team, spent years on the project making emotional celebrity statements, and here is The rock who only just joined, trying to out perform and taking away their hard earned credit. Spirituality is not taking anyone&#39;s credit, because the funny thing is that, we gain credit from God when we give Him the credit. The movies we make are devoted to Him but we gain recognition from Him for doing those movies. Spiritually speaking.

The rock has had beef with tyrese and now vin diesel . Im starting to think the rocks the problem in this. I like the rocks character in ff but vin diesel n tyrese make the movie way better than the rock. They are the ogs the rock tryna act like he a og smh

Tyrese is a clown! There&#39;s a spin-off from Han&#39;s backstory from Tokyo Drift. This is (was) Paul Walker&#39;s Franchise movie, not about Tyrese Gibson family show. Whoever, is in the movie, is created by the producers... I&#39;m sure Tyrese would love to have his own backstory, but that&#39;s not going to happen. Tyrese is good for extra, a side kick, acting supporter but, never the actual main attraction leading star.Bottom Line: Tyrese is jealous.

F9 was garbage

Like seriously whoever believed this idiot after wasting ur time I’m so sorry bc that’s 5 minutes I can’t get back

I honestly never even heard of Hobbs and Shaw until this video tbh. Lol

Why does this channel hate tyrese?

Do the research bro video not deleted it still there

The only spinoff they could have made was with Roman and Tej. Hobbs and Shaw was shit

Are f&amp;f actors in some sort of cult?

I think Tyrese has something against the rock because of the color of is skin

I never had a problem with the rock until he was in fast 5. He was awkward and out of place. Completely ruined the vibe.

Black people dominate in a lot of stuff...But the competitions ends when they hit The Rock.

to be honest the rock destroys the franchise meaning wich is racing once he joined the franchise become more like &quot;Gi Joe&quot; wich made the rock owns &amp; steal the show like in &quot;hobbs &amp; shaw&quot; and he turned on the others like Vin and Tyrece so the rock in this franchise is just a baby face who brings more money

Tyrese sucks.Dwayne i love u

Hope they make up

Hobbs and Shaw &gt; F9

He better hide his forehead

I love the Rock, but when he has beef w/Vin, then has beef w/&#39;rese?? Sry eyebrow but YOU may just be the issue. HOWEVER, (&amp; this is important)..it&#39;s pronounced SHAHN-rah, not John-raw. C&#39;mon Baby Boy/Jody/Tyrese 

I don&#39;t mind the Hobbs and Shaw spin-off because neither of them are actually part of the &quot;Family&quot; cast.

Gibbs is all in his feelings 

Tyrese takes F&amp;F movies personal.  You gotta remember he and Paul Walker were close friends in real life, not just on the movie set.

Tyrese had a big ass forehead. That’s what happened.

Hahaha Tyrese mad he didn&#39;t get a spin-off

The rock is arrogant successful But I like tyrese  he is Acting natural and emotional

This is why I hate humanity like we need to work together even aliens can work better than us and we don&#39;t know if they exist man humanity

Non superhero? the bad guy has superhero powers XD

Dwayne is kind of a moron ngl

<a href="">0:06</a> The Rundown disagrees with you.

Tyrese ain’t the clown his character is so much better than hobbs and is more needed I’d rather watch a Roman scene than a Hobbs scene he way better in the movie vies than anyone now

Ever since Paul died. I never took the franchise serious. Let&#39;s not forget who continued the franchise and that was Paul.

Tyrese is literally a crybaby. The fast franchise is literally what&#39;s paying his bills. Frankly, the franchise would do just fine w/o him.

I’m with Tyrese here, The Rock has a huge ego to go into the franchise and try to make it his, never was his never will be.

“You better hide that big ass forehead”-The Rock

I think everyone is just being petty should squash the beef like grown men and conduct themselves as professionals

Crazy how fast 1 and 2 were super classics and fast 5 was really good too....then it all went downwards, and is at the worst stage ever. Fast 7, 8 and now the latest f&amp;f are all horrible.

Fast &amp; Furious Transformations, is going to be a transformers family teaming with Doms family.

Black rose is shit singing is not his ting

Id rather see the rock than that cringe buster Roman.

haha family at Hollywood? really? people don&#39;t be naive, it&#39;s business.

Enjoy both actors......but &quot;Roman&quot; must stay in this franchise...🇿🇦

People always assumed The Rock&#39;s post was about Vin Diesel...I have my doubts about but it certainly led to a feud later

They should have stopped at fast 1

The Rock can rent an ice cream truck in the middle of winter, during a blizzard and post he&#39;s selling ice cream on his social media and he would still bring in more revenue than a Fast and Furious spinoff movie featuring Tyrese as the star

2 fast 2 furious was better than Hobbs and Shaw

I know that Vin Diesel also didn&#39;t get along with Dwayne Johnson, wonder how it was working like for him in Fast and the  Furious  i just think he was the new guy in the franchise and they wanted to give him a hard time and not let him outshine them and the movie but he is a bigger star than Tyrese and Vin.

But he didn&#39;t go solo, Jason Statham was in the movie too.. 

I thought it was because of the big ass forehead comment

Tyrese needs to know the rock is light skin  so he will be favoured over him ... just facts of the world lol

tyrese would get hi ass  whoopped in real life

Hahaha dwayne johnson doesn&#39;t give a f

I thought we learned a long time ago that actors only care about making money.

Youll see people with quality are siding with Tyrese and plain dipshits who sides with The Rock.

Anyone watching any of these after Tokyo Drift is a clown.

Still love Hobbs and Shaw!!

They should box 

Tyrese sounds like a real hater to be honest.

Dwayne gives off &quot; this is all about me&quot; vibe

tyrese was  right in most of what he said

The Rock made Fast franchise a superteam... now he out... the fast n furious franchise is a family beyond blood with a code of honor heart to heart but the spin off is about the f word that&#39;s more blood related in ideology.

It&#39;s a tough argument on who I prefer more in the F&amp;F franchise.

The rock thinks the sun shines out of his ass

why does the rock has to stop his bag for tyrese-?

the most unreal scene for  FF franchise is in FF9.. a car going up to the space? whaatttt!!!

They really making the ff saga more shittier with the spin-off....i cant hardly watch the movie with cursing and pause due to boring action and lame acting by the rock.

Sorry but Hobbs and Shaw was a bad ass Funny action movie

The successful freon intriguingly copy because octave unpredictably chase absent a colossal fact. scandalous, clever roast

They showed their true face

It’s cuz the rock called his forehead big

Ill bet if Paul is ard.. he will think abt family and will not like this

No offense, but the FF franchise lost its purpose since movie 2. It was supposed to be cars, girls and races with some story line. Now, it&#39;s about fighting terrorist?? I mean, really???!!!!

I’m sorry but most of the rocks films absolutely suck, the  fast and furious “franchise” especially, they get worse and worse cheesier and cheesier and the rock don’t help, I’m sorry “fast family” absolute shit

DO U SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING

The exotic goose industrially squeal because appliance hypothetically attempt but a righteous rise. sad, lackadaisical saudi arabia

The real Fast And Furious franchise ended just when paul left us AMEN I LOVE THIS COMMENT I AGREE

I only care about 3 of the characters tbh, Dom, Brian and Han.

ROCK IS NARCISSUS  BUT WHO ISN&#39;T NOW IN DAY&#39;S ..

If it can survive without Paul Walker, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll make it without Tyrese 

And Tokyo drift didn&#39;t break up the family seriously if tyre really cared about his daughter he would sell everything in his name for her well being. Tyre is the real 

The rock tried to make Hobbs and Shaw look like a family thing but Gibson was right, the family is broken 

 The Rock is worth more than the orginial cast of Fast and Furious combined. The Rock is a bigger star than Vin Diesel, Tyrese can&#39;t even get a role in a movie outside of Fast and Furious franchise. So i think the beef isn&#39;t really a beef more like little dogs trying to hold a big dog down.

I hope they can be friends in the end,  I do understand that,  that doesn&#39;t always work out

It&#39;s just like Apple, when Steve Jobs passed iphones became shit, same case here Paul walker passed and F&amp;F died with him. This ain&#39;t nothing but an action movie.

Nothing personal (lets just leave Paul out of this), Dwayne is an amazing entertainer.....&quot;Tyrese&quot; focus more on entertainment then about people who are gone......move on man!!!!

F&amp;F 7 should have been the perfect closure but vin diésel is just an egomaniac who wants to keep doing that sht forever.

I love and respect them both i think they should put aside their differences and work together

The movie is about family? I stopped watching after Tokyo drift  but Doesn&#39;t the rock hate his brother in the movie

Who cares

Finally the Rock has come back to Hollywood! Rock all the way

The rocks just jealous someone else is getting the light in his movies 

Bobby Brown

Roman Pierce is a result of first Fast and Furious movie Spin-off

The movies stopped being about racing and family when Paul died.  Tyrise is a big joke, just look how he handled the whole apple/beats deal

Screw roman peirce  was good in 2 fast 2 furious apart from that he is pure ass they made his character a dumb idiot with ehit jokes after that .same as the rock he was good in fast 5 then they made him cheese 2

“Was” hell nah he still is <a href="">0:08</a>

Tyrese is just jealouse

Now the Rock isn&#39;t in Fast9 and tyrese is

Why can&#39;t fast and furious go back to The fast and the furious

Eh hem  (Ego&#39;s)

The spinoff was trash

Admit it, Tokyo drift was the real fast and furious

Rock&#39;s EGO is bigger than him.

My dream: Vin Diesel+Paul Walker+John Cena+Dwayne Johnson

Fast 10 - Paul walker return from death.

The only reason that the spin-off movie made money was that people thought it was going to be a good movie because it was part of the Fast and Furious.. But the movie is really Dumb and we wasted our money... The Rock needs to go sit down somewhere......

This franchise can only be successful by bringing paul Walker&#39;s character back, it will not be able to replace what paul have done ,but i think it will do the work,because Brian by Paul have a different fanbase.

Fast Furious 

Who gives a crap! The Rock and The Stath in their own movie superb. And that&#39;s NOT RnB check out stevie Ray vaughn for real RnB

Tyrese seems jealous ngl.

Sorry, Nicki, I don&#39;t agree with you the Rock was already a household name in movies before entering the Fast and the Furious franchise.

I will be honest why say family,  the original side died years ago after Tokyo drift , it&#39;s a good franchise and I loved fast 9 but I seriously think it needs to end please my honest opinion in my eyes , not everyone will agree but it needs a finally and give it a break it truly needs!

Let’s be honest nobody watches Fast series for Gibson 

Rock

Thats true that spinoff was fukin bad all it was is about wwe bitches

The rock too busy endorsing Biden...

The deadpan curler thankfully handle because bangle topologically kill next a lowly manicure. muddled, clean self

Literally stopped watching F &amp; F when Paul passed away. It isn’t the same without Paul.

The rock helped fast n furious name grow more than Tyrese did. I’m team Dwayne because I know Tyrese started it and Dwayne is my best friend 

The wholesale heat additionly frame because flax july receive despite a redundant wrist. satisfying, squalid bay

I liked Tyrese but I’m team Dwayne Johnson all day long . The fast n furious team made a ballsy decision to choose Tyrese over the hottest actor in Hollywood the rock.

Tyrese was wanting $ &amp; upset cause he wasn&#39;t n spin off.  That beef was what amounts to wrestling promos. Ludicrous posted a video of DJ slapping Tyrese.  Scripted Event!  Real beef was DJ &amp; VD.

The forehead over the rock Dom is the ALPHA

BULLSHIT ... he made it when they chose to make a movie around him called scorpion king ... fast and furiosa came after that ... you missed even the rock saying what set him on his acting career ...

Take away the roids and hgh and the Rock is just a pebble with narcissistic problems . Get off the needles and see how many go to your movies then !!

I dont know how Hobbs and shaw made so much money, watched it with anticipation only to be disappointed with all of the forced oneliners that were supposed to be funny.

Honestly I when I stopped watching the franchise so long ago it was when they introduced the rock

Vin made and help the rock get as big as he is with the 5th movie lol

I don’t know why Dwayne the rock Johnson had any issues with vin diesel the GPAT who then took a step back and break for the rock to blossom lol makes me resent the rock even more.. vin should be were he is at now and soon will be overcoming the rock in Hollywood again @vindeisel

Hobbs n Shaw anytime! Fast....forget it!

Rock

What&#39;s tyrese crying about? Tokyo Drift and fast and furious 2?He just want to make money and he wasn&#39;t part of it.

they should have respect for the fast and furios  family..Hobbs is not part of it..

Glad the stone is gone

I don&#39;t understand and i don&#39;t care...

People still watch those movies?? Grats to Dwayne &quot;The Pebble&quot; Johnson for succeeding in making movies for teenagers!

dwayne keep it business

Who else doesn&#39;t  care?

I could do without Tyrese hated him since 2f2f

Big Dwayne Johnson fan but yeah he selfish for that. Ruined the fast &amp; furious franchise

im not laughing at all. imreally not...

Oh please, if the Fast &amp; Furious producer&#39;s approached Tyrese Gibson for a stand alone movie on his character he would tell them no? I don&#39;t think so. He would jump on it in a second no doubt!!! So you can&#39;t blame the Rock for going for it!!!

The feud actually started between the rock and vin, tyrese just jumped in and made it &quot;viral&quot; ...

I will never consider fast and the furious hobbs and shaw A part of fast and the furious franchise but I will say it was OK movie but The Rock needs to stop Acting like it is his movie I Love to race and I have been watching fast and furious movies since the beginning and stop acting like a bad ass 805

Doesn’t matter anymore.  Probably two more fast and furious series and its done.  No more..    They all getting too old and its not about cars/ racing anymore.

M us all

Black Rose? Lol never heard of her

This is bullshit because Vin diesel was working on Marvel movies and so we’re others. Tyrese was just hating.

Tyrese who?

how you gonna care how another man eats.......acting is unpredictable, you have to take what you can when you can......Tyrese is lame for that

Dwayne Johnson said Kamala Harris is a certified bad ass which makes him a certified jack ass . She is the enemy within simple as that .

Dwayn Johnson is a certified jack ass .

The rock? Too much cooking for himself. Seriously guys... Its like all about him now. Van is the head and he does it well. Our rocky?  All hunky trying to be head of family and g.i. Joe.

Dwayne Johnson is a garbage actor. Love how big muscular men think they&#39;re untouchable when a microscopic organism can kill you. They only wish they can do half the hollywood bs in real life. Rock should join UFC if he thinks hes so strong.

The funniest part of all this is Vin diesel walked away after the 1st FNF and said &quot;a sequel will be pointless were would it go&quot;.Years later fnf 4 vin back Did good but then need the rock for 5/6/7/8 9 will flop due to wwe dyed black hair thats a long lost brother gmafbAnd we have a miracle in a character  coming back from the dead Gaurantee he will have The rock back for 10 if not that will flop also

The rock is going to be on top no matter what..

Anyone who&#39;s seen it will tell you Hobbs and Shaw&#39;s is a terrible movie in a stain on the franchise

The Rock should be kicked out FF9, it should go back to the origins

Tyrese just mad he didn&#39;t get a spin off

I like these films, but in a way I feel they&#39;re all shit too, coz it&#39;s too fake and all CGI crap.   But whatev&#39;s.

To me that&#39;s when Fast and Furious went down the pan, bringing in Johnson

People when I saw it but the movie suck.

Rock. The movie F and F was already established. You didn&#39;t do shit.

Tyrese still salty af?

Johnson just go back to your stage ass wrestling

They both suck

Tyrese care so much cuz thats his only income lol

Rock holding the men to such high standards. Geesh Duane cut&#39;em some slack, not everyone is fueled by steroids‍ 

Who cares, no Paul walker no fast and the furious. Everyone knows that.

To be fair it’s still sort of sad how much of a typical Hollywood mouth piece the rock had become. Calling him a sell out would be generous the guy lost all forms of what made his image explode and is now just a natty denying muscle head. Nothing genuine stays in hollywood very long. Either conform to the money or get lost in the dust.

   srry Jason da star mon

Baby boy can’t beat the Rock even if the Rock has both hands tied behind his back! 

I&#39;d rather see Johnson in there anyway. No time of day for Gibson.

100% tyrese the rock loves him self to much it always has to be about him..OG TYRESE

Screw the Rock with his ego he was never been part of the Fast and Furious family he never will!

I dont understand why people care so much about &quot;celebrity&quot; beef lol. &quot;hey two guys who worked together for years dont get along and made their personal beef into a public spectacle.&quot; thats all that happened lol. The movies are highly entertaining and thats the goal. I could give two shits about how the actors feel about each other.

black BREEEEEEEEEEE, is the leady LADY

NO more snack, or stay away

Rock , meet BREEE I am the boos and future dictor so , U will face me, as your boss

my right hook, is special LOL

First Vin now Tyress, have to wonder where the problem lies.

HAHAHAtrue to the heart of FF ?its all changing in FF4 where they`re suddenly turns to chase drug lordand you still blabbering about the hearts of FF franchiseits all about superhero like movie, and of course, THE STREET ALWAYS WIN!! HAHA

Those spin off is all about samoan right?

Tyrese is just bitter. He should know his role and shut his mouth. Hobbs and Shaw ain’t the first F&amp;F spinoff, Toyko Drift? 

I hate the rock in the fast and the furious.  So bad person to have in the movie.

the only time the character of Tyrese was cool was in the second movie, but now his character became corny and lame

Ill always support Tyrese. The dude is real. Unlike other people

Tyrese the og

Bullshit!

Tht boi mad bc the rock is living a better life

Maybe Rock had to many &quot;roidz&quot; for breakfast....dat day....?!

Tyrese just hating man. I mean, this is business nothing personal but for you to say to a man to not do a movie that&#39;s just petty childish rant.

The cruel permission unequivocally double because triangle basally instruct by a debonair sidewalk. nimble, animated step-grandfather

Dwayne shouldn’t be shamed for wanting to further his career, just because Paul and Vin never accept spin off offers doesn’t mean he couldn’t, and if this was really such a problem why wasn’t statham getting the same hate? He also agreed to a spin off

This whole time I thought the beef was with Vin Diesel

I guess he really took that &quot;not as big as your forehead&quot; quiet seriously 

You do know that was just a publicity stunt...?? Geez people will believe anything.

Bruh they&#39;re all ridiculous films who cares about a spin off. Also the spin off was fine

You won&#39;t b miss tyrese

Jason Statham &gt; The Rock &gt; Tyrese

So the forehead scene... Was it a behind the scenes feud coming to the camera?

Tyrese is being an ass here he had a the very second fast &amp; furious movie was his spin-off thing and he took it with Paul.. there was no fast and furious family in it. he can&#39;t digest the fact that he is just the movie&#39;s Clown.

i love it when it was more about cars and street race. the rock ruined it , he was good in 5 they shoul&#39;ve not bring him back after 5. and Paul was the man, it was over after he passed away

I’m a fast and furious fan and till this day I’ve never watched Show n Hobbs or whatever it’s called

tyrese acting childish.  Johnson don&#39;t take the job if they don&#39;t hire us

Tyresse u f up could of paid that child benefit

Statham actually knows how to fight though but I think the rock can still take him

I think the rock would mop the floor with Tyrese if they did fight for real

The first 2 sequels were basically spin-offs if we&#39;re being honest. Tokyo Drift more so than 2 Fast, I guess. but we didn&#39;t get the proper cast again until they rebooted with 4 (Fast &amp; Furious).

Fast &amp; Furious didn&#39;t make Rock a movie star  he was already a movie star/ action hero. Tyrese bitter bc he&#39;s just a mediocre actor &amp; singer.

Hobbs and shaw was terrible , only reason it made that much is because it’s the rock.

Can we a another Tokyo drift? I watched the org 1 1000x. Like another

🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

rock is a clown

The Rock always rocks the  party 

Kinda seems like tyrese Gibson is just because a jealous crybaby.

There shouldn&#39;t be any B. S. About behind the scenes problems, you guys are forgetting about the fans,the ones who Made ALL of you famous! Keep your guys ridiculous rants and differences to yourselves, u don&#39;t remember any belly aching and ridiculous complaints when the Fast and the Furious was all about street  racing! Not all of CGI crap! You guys should seriously go back to street racing which is still happening! First 3 FnF&#39;s were the best! Grass roots! Miss that 

rock is fake as whole wwf  no place inmovies!

I still believe it&#39;s all about jealousy of Dwayne. He should be happy for him, not hating. I hear nothing but good things from stars about Dwayne. So, that should say something there.

Hobbs &amp; Shaw was a success and I enjoyed it but it wasn’t really a F&amp;F.

non superhero? u sure? 

It did get wack after it turned into the rock chasing jason statham for 3 movies

Old men should just kiss and make up enough with feuds they old

Roman Pearce is a little b*<b>*</b>

Greedy move by rock soil

Oh shit

Tyrese  is a great actor

I just watched Hobbs and Shaw for the first time. It&#39;s overrated garbage. Turn off your brain to enjoy it. Rock holding a Helicopter with a chain. smh Im not a Tyrese fan but he&#39;s right

I feel like Hobbs and shaw has nothing to do with fnf

Family is family

I feel like Dwayne wanted to be the Star of the movie. Most movies he acted in, he has the leading role.

So ur saying ppl a clown to play checkers I guess his big head is getting to him now. Smh black man a fight against there own

Yeah cause both like pissaz and hotdogz and a lot of nitro Eww Both are 

These movies are all horrendous pieces of shit. All of them. Pretty funny how Jason Statham managed to avoid any criticism from Tyrese and other cast members for being part of the spin off.

Can&#39;t lie, I thought Hobbs and Shaw was dope. It wasn&#39;t realistic but I liked it

It wasn’t a good movie and I can’t stand racist Rock! I don’t think he made the movie but the other actors. I’ll be glad when his rated B acting skills are pulled.

Movie is dogshit lol who cares

I agree, you don&#39;t go off and make spin offs, that&#39;s selfish. Stick with the family aka the originals.

Bro this is work, It&#39;s not the Rock&#39;s fault he knows where his real family is

Gotta love it how a guy who learns to drive in a straight line fast can now launch a car off a cliff and get caught by a futuristic fighter jet. Sorry but F&amp;F has lost what everyone loved it for to begin with.... STREET RACING.

The franchise turned into call of duty..I remember it used to be about illegal racing?

It&#39;s crazy how scenes from the movie answers all the beef

If Gibson is not in fast 9 then any true fast and furious fan would not watch it.....we know his value to fast and furious movies.....

The Rock and ice cold can of whoop ass.️ Tyrese just an ass.

After the 1st F.F. all others suck period.

I want Paul back so bad

Tyrese and Vin Diesel are just JEALOUS of the Rocks success.

The Rock is a sellout like he&#39;s lil friend Kevin Hart!

Common  guy

Tyrese needs that fast furious check baaad. It’s just something to do for the rock. The ROCK is disciplined and tyrese is a lost sole

Tyrese 

The rock isn&#39;t apearing in the trailer.... so sad :(

It&#39;s the some anymore without Paul walker sorry guys.

The rock is all about himself always was always will be Facts

Paul was an actor the rock is just two HUGE to act .

Didnt explain jack shit waste time this video

Tyrese is right!

The fast and the furious is no longer about cars are racing......... Sadly

This is third grade ego&#39;s on steroids. I really thought Rock would stop this but he has made it a real messy childish public issue. A small and private meeting could have prevented this.  A very sad ending exposing petty childness and frustration for both men.

The rock isn&#39;t an actor he is a entertainer that&#39;s what he does period..

We

Imagine a modern day Fast and Furious movie that is just about cars and big racing tournaments, whenever it&#39;s on the streets in a city or just in the open planes of a desert.. To bad it won&#39;t happen, it&#39;s all about over the top dumb action and saving the world.. What&#39;s next? Spaceships? Smh..

Johnson has a big EGO, not like is brain... which seems on the small side for behaving like a teen with a chip on his shoulder.

He gave Universal an ultimatum saying it&#39;s me or The Rock? And how did he think that was going to turn out again 

The old crew, with their cars. That’s all

&quot;you never had it, you never had your car&quot;

Now see, Hobbs and Shaw was the only “Fast and Furious” movie I didn’t watch. Have no desire to either. I kind of agree, there was no need to do a spin-off. Especially with the Rock. I like him as an actor but this is not his franchise. He was a supporting actor to their movie that they were main characters in. The movie just didn’t seem the same and I can’t believe it did well in theaters lol. I also can’t believe they kept on going after Paul Walker sadly passed. I think they should’ve shut it down after that very heartfelt scene where Dom and him say goodbye (even though I know it wasn’t actually him, it was his brother) and go their separate ways. That scene always gets me. It should’ve stopped there.

Both of them need to grow up Hobbs and Shaw was a garbage movie!

Yea well all those movies are shitty to start with anyway..... Name your favorite fast and furious garbage ?

Was &quot;once&quot; a wrestling legend?

Fast and furious is shit

I love seeing the rock in the movies he is so awesome and good looking to u go big guy

Who cares !

Nah... the movie franchise ended when it wasn’t about cars!

The movies are for the fans. Not two people having diffrences. First they changed the formula. Hooked up street race cars, undercover detective and story twist &quot;bad guys are the good guys&quot;. The first four movies went by these methods and were great. I like all of them but 2 fast 2 furious will always top them for me because the opening was fire!

non of them ain&#39;t more famous than the rock

Yeah the original f&amp;f was better now its like the story took a left and kept going..

As much as I like the Rock, his first bashes against tyrese were about unprofessionalism, then he proceeded to get pretty unprofessional himself. Disappointing!

Tyrese is out of his league even though I’m a fan. The rock presence is enough to command a large box office success with or without Tyrese. The Rock has a strong and captivating presence in any movie he does. In my opinion, the public will more likely cling to Johnson.

Tyree don&#39;t have the kind of JUICE to gate &quot;THE ROCK&quot;.Son you better RECOGNIZE.&quot;can you dig it sucka&quot;.

I am siding with tyrese

We are Global African Indigenous people!! Love and Unity is the best key for us all together!!Also Giving thanks to the Great Mother&#39;s/Goddesses and Great Father&#39;s/Gods and the Ancestors and Guardians!! Saying from Snefer aka Bashiyr!!

Street racing doesn&#39;t need the Rock. I was so pissed off to see him with them. ugh!

Jason statham

Fast and furious is not about cars anymore. Its about triggering physics professors everywhere.

THE ROCK,, WORD UP BROTHER,, WE LITESKIN BROTHERS ARE FAMILY AND YOU ROCK REPRESENTS US.

You know a lot of people never seen the first 3 fast and furious. My mate never knew what the silver skyline, supra, evo etc.

The Rock wants a takeover the franchise, duh ,he ain&#39;t even know how to race and drift.

The rock was the worst cast member ever in the F&amp;F franchise. Jason “Shaw” was perfect fit.



He&#39;s not taking the plane.

The girl&#39;s that play Sulki and Ramsey as well.

Jordana to

Jason included.

Vin as well.

Paul as well.

Ludacris agrees

Ya know I think I know why Roman did not like Hobbs and Shawn movie BECUASE in 2 fast and 2 furious it&#39;s about him and Paul but now his friend gone and he&#39;s sad dam thats hard to take in

Personally I love the Rock been a fan since his wrestling days but respectfully I will say i think Fast n Furious was good without him.Overall Fast n Furious lost its true meaning of cars and racing

BOTH

Well, if we&#39;re being honest here.. The only real racing in FnF was Tokyo Drift, the rest were 50% to 80% action.

Should have stopped at fast and furious 7. Nobody can fill the gap paul left.

Damn tyreese is salty

Bro I don’t even enjoy fnf like I use too 

1 year ago

If you smelllllllllll what the rock is cooking. Dwayne The Rock Johnson is the greatest WWE wrestler, multiple world champion, and entertainer of a time. And that fake Tyrese Gibson who lost the war with Dwayne The Rock Johnson and putting that lame video crying What more do you want from me? I&#39;m not doing anything illegal turned into a song congratulations you big dummy cryrese I&#39;m mean Tyrese.

Who tf cares about the fast and furious shit anymore ? The star of that passed .

Did he day the rock was once a wrestling LEGEND he will always be a wrestling LEGEND

haven&#39;t seen  hobbs and shaw

There was some footage knocking about a while ago of the rock giving him a slap,not sure how legit it was,looked pretty real though.

I’m sorry but Rock killed the whole thing for me, he really thinks that he’s the center of attention, Paul would’ve left if he had to be apart of the new bullshit

I miss the time when it was all about carsNow theres superman

Well Dwayne won&#39;t be in F9 so we know who wins

Tyrese jealous ass

Dwayne Johnson pump your iron does not change the fact your a sell out you thought you represent the people but look how much you have taken since given your first opportunity you need to take a step back and remember who you and your people are right now your a disrespect jump back on tick tock and your social media like a coward

They should’ve stopped with this franchise after Tokyo drift!!

Tokyo drift was the last good F&amp;F

Tyrese was the worst part of any FF.

The Rock seems like a the ultimate hypocrite,  don’t really buy the ‘good guy image’ he seems like a money hungry dude. Hobbs &amp; Shaw was like the stereotype action movie: all muscles and no brain. Tyrese is the OG of the movie series, The Rock is just trying to steal the show and make it all about himself. Other than that, F&amp;F died some time ago.

I miss when Fast and Furious was about racing and cars

cant get into the rocks movies

Tyrese

My favorite Fast and the furious movie was 2 fast 2 furious with Tyrese and Paul Walker. Their chemistry was so authentic and genuine. They made a good duo and it seems that&#39;s what Tyrese is trying to protect he trying to keep that legacy alive but of course the film makers bias mindset when it comes to being obsessed with numbers is the only thing they care about. R.I.P Paul Walker and much respect to Tyrese for keeping Paul Walker legacy alive even Paul Walker dad said outta all the cast members he liked Tyrese the most

Tyrese the man... I like Tyrese he&#39;s a good guy.  They&#39;ll try to downplay Tyrese because he&#39;s passionate.

How are people not like the actions lol. Fast and furious is not all about race lol the dude started of as FBI. Let that sink in

Tyrese forgets Tokyo drift

So fast and furious when to shit because of the rock great.

I love the Rock been his fan since attitude era days but tyrese been acting since Baby Boy so I&#39;m siding with Tyrese

The beef started when rock smacked tyrese with that &#39;better hide your hairline&#39; line.

He is so petty!

tyrese is a mediocre actor at best

who the hell want unrealistic and super rediculous stunt, i feel kinda cringe on the movie/franchise that i loved before

They rich....  Why be petty to each other

Yeah bring back racing smh

i hate the rock involve in the franchise ,  iam a F and f fan, its my childhood but when the rock introduced in the film, the next incoming movie became super hero or more on unrealistic than the past movies, and i hate it cause i feel he ruin the car guy&#39;s movie turned into a mecha car super hero movie

Aye, the rock, been in there since fast n furious 4

I&#39;m holding u to that popcorn tho cuz that shit is expensive

When Dwyane joined in Fast 5 I knew he wasn&#39;t the type of person who wants to remain as a supporting actor. He&#39;ll do everything he can to be the Main Character.

Hobbs and Shaw is an asecret agent action movie. They just added fast&amp;furious but nothing was really related. I sure missed the old FF movies from 1 to 7.

Tyrese 4 me sounded kinda jealous sm times

The Only reason they made Hobbs and Shaw is cause they cant really make another Fast and Furious without Paul thats worth a shit!!! Hobbs and Shaw...give me a pathetic break. Anyone who watched it is a disgrace!!! RIP Paul i  u!!!!

bro this isn&#39;t real beef this is a storyline leading up to wrestlemania‍️

this movie cane out on my birthday. my brother never took me to see it:( still haven’t watched it either and its 2021 now

Hobbs and Shaw sucked ass how did it even get close to 1billion???

they seemed to have pushed back the rocks hairline but then again it could be just me‍️

Ok bro bye

Tyrese and Paul Walker should&#39;ve done a sequal before or after 2 Fast 2 Furious.Would&#39;ve been sick.

Not saying this to defend the rock but hes not the only1 who left the franchise to do a solo thing Vin left it to &amp; didnt wanna appear in the sequel

not gonna lie.....i started hating rock after this !!

The Rock does suck as an actor. He peaked as a WWE star

Dang imagine a spin off with just Paul would’ve been crazy

He dabbled in acting before fast and furious?.. lol that&#39;s cute

Tyrese was much funnier. I love the rock but I could do w/o him in the franchise.

If you’ll notice...the rock is not in FF9. Looks like Tyrese is calling the shots

That album was garbage

the Fast And Furious franchise movies were great but now its like watching Fast And Furious franchise vs the transformers

Fast Five was the last true F&amp;F movie for the franchise. I’m not going to lie Dwayne took over the franchise and ruined it because he’s a bigger actor then all of them which is truly sad.

Carnt wAit for Hobbs and shaw 2

Astrology is real....their zodiacs signs DO NOTTTT GET A LONG what so ever !!!! These two are like fire &amp; gasoline tyrese is chinese horse &amp; the rock is born in the rat year horses &amp; rats don’t get along in chinese astrology PERIOD!

Hobbs &amp; Shaw blew up because of Jason Statham...... not ThE RoCk

Tyrese bitchin that he an og when in reality, he and the rock has the same number of appearance in fnf franchise

Plain and simple! The Rock is a superstar and who’s Tyrees ? Someone is jealous!! 

F&amp;F was about cars before The Rock joined the franchise

We still  don&#39;t give a Fk. Two of the worst actor in Hollywood. The Rock still think he&#39;s in WWE in every movie.Tyreese still think he&#39;s in the hood.

I prefer the rock over tyrese But fast and furious was about illegal street racing and cars and family. Tyrese was there before the rock. So I will side with tyrese because he was part of franchise. Dwayne and Jason are great actors. But It was about them. Instead of what Paul walker loved

After tokyo drift the franchise  went to shit.

Man! I miss the old school f&amp;f racing movies

Dwayne (the rock)is a straight forward actor ,portrays the same character in ever movie no special effect lets stop gassing this guy up he already had a fan base because of wcw, wwf wwe years its only to be expected there still supporting him in his movies

Hobbs and Shaw was a straight up cash grab. Let’s keep it a buck

Fast 5 was the last good one

I was suprisingly happy with Hobbs and Shaw. Theres nothing bad about expanding the universe even further. Honestly, I would be 100% down to see other spin offs aswell such as like &quot;Pierce and Parker&quot; or something.Theyre like Star Wars stories: Individual movies that deepens the connection and lore within certain characters. Thats ALWAYS a good thing.

Tbh Hobbs and Shaw wasnt that good

&quot;in the now deleted videos&quot; lol. Translation. I don&#39;t have evidence but this is what I heard.

Haven&#39;t watched any f and f since the 4th movie I believe. Plan on catching up soon but it seems so different than the older movies lmao

I&#39;m just happy to have more fast and furious. I wish it went back to its roots, but I&#39;m in the minority. Spin offs are okay as long as they continue the main story line. The only thing I don&#39;t like is that episode 9 is so delayed.

We hongry

I can see where tyrse is coming from. Rock took GI Joe away from channing. and has been making Rock films. Hobbs n shaw would be okay if it didn&#39;t have FF on it. FF was already over the top but to add cyborgs into the universe...ughhh. But its okay cuz im not watching it so  I don&#39;t have to sit thru a Rock movie.

If tyrese wouldve been given the chance he wouldnt have passed it... vin diesel and paul walker could afford to pass their spin offs because they had other projects to work on...

I&#39;m not watching anything with the Rock he&#39;s just another meat head who takes the spot light its annoying.

Bottom line  They BOTH sound like women Yap Yap Yap,blah blah blah

Tyrese will ever send that money to you

Tyrese literally says:  You mess with family and my daughters survival....There you have it. It’s all because Tyrese doesn’t have a part in this movie and his acting career is in jeopardy if they stop making FF movies in favor of spin offs. Why else would he react this way about a spin off? For sentimental reasons?And he’s calling the Rock selfish? This coming from the guy who wants to halt a movie from being produced which would create work for thousands of people in the chain, all because he’s not in it.

Seems like tyrese was the one that started it the rock was just defending himself

The real reason they were beefing&quot;You better hide that big ass forehead.&quot;

The rock was a box office star in the mummy 2001!

i mean i dont understand why Tyrese so mad at The Rock for having another movie... its not even related to F&amp;F

Happy Tuesday! When you feel like you been here before! &quot;STAY READY&quot; The new video by Piercing Instincts :)

I wouldn&#39;t watch any of these movies at gunpoint.  They all sucked.  You can throw in those shitty Jumanji movies too.

They both acting like 16 year old girls.

i agree with tyrese... the rock jus likes to be the center of attention... i dont think he should have made it past fast 5!

Tyrese was on drugs forsure lol but Hobbs and Shaw was weak!

I&#39;ve never heard of Hobbs and Shaw.

Tokyo drift feel like a spin off with Hans and diesel at the end

i always wondered if these so called beefs in the entertainment world are even real

Why is roman so scared after 2 fast 2 furious anyone have any theory

Not a big fan of the rock,

I’m so tired of these clowns in this publications taking Black lingo and completely making it sound corny.

I don&#39;t look the flim yet 

Of course the movie did good 2 Hollywood badasses team up to blow shit up and kick ass action suspense a little romance. It&#39;s an escape from the real world that&#39;s what ppl want

bra dwayne was just a cop at first now hes apart of the family

Hobbs and Shaw was crap anyway

R.I.P paul

Tyresse has a point tho . Just saying ‍️

WOOOW, well that&#39;s plain and clear right there, sometimes some of these videos claiming that there&#39;s beef with stars, are exadurating, but this one was clear that they are beefing 

i cant stand  johnson at all, every movie that he co-stars he tries to take over. Gi JOE was not the same after he took over. fast n the furious the same. he knows nothing about team work. the maker of the movie fast n furious are to be blamed because they wrote the script n had him take over. pretty soon no one will want to do no movie that has to have other parts with him because he will just take over.somme one should call john ceana to beat his ass again.

it needs to be said, the rock is just a terrible actor.

The franchise did change after the rock came

<b>you better hide those big ass forehead</b>

&quot;WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME?&quot;

But the rock all the way

Tyrese is funny

Luckily The Rock isn&#39;t in fast 9, or else the Fast 9 is going to be a goddamn ripoff.. And hobbs and Shaw movie is really bad and it shouldn&#39;t exist at the first. After the rock was in Fast and furious series, it doesn&#39;t seem right and its just ruined. I just want the OLD fast and furious, it isn&#39;t the same anymore. Its not about racing, it&#39;s just HEIST. Like the original of fast and furious was about racing. Now its just trash, but fast 9 seems to be an amazing episode since Sean and Han was in the movie. Fast 8 is amazing but just sucks because of the rock. What I hate is that his behaviour and attitude that he say about tyrese album, like that&#39;s not funny and not cool.

the first fast and fury movie is in a totally different league when compared to these latest cartoon movies in my opinion

i never liked Dwayne The Rock is so fooney

Tyrese is a stand up guy and Dwayne Johnson is ONLY out of himself

<a href="">4:57</a> non-super hero?

All this speculations, all this drama....we all know the reason why they really hate each other....They all hid baby oils from the rock and Tyrese can&#39;t hide his big ass forehead

I&#39;d love to see them squash this if we can get them together for the next movie.

To many bald heads

Tryese should be partnof this Franchise I enjoyed his funny acting and character.

The fast and furious is ebout the rock! When Paul died the original movie died with him

how come dwayne johnson always plays as stong guys

Fast and furious was meant to be about street racing gangsta not about government

Hobbs and Shaw did put up the numbers. But that movie was trash! No racing, just car chases. The love hate relationship between them was cringy and the K Hart cameo? Wow like I have to side only with Gibson for that reason. Cause who did Hobbs and Shaw open the door for? Idris is already a star. Unless that shit was meant for Roman Reigns and the others?

Why y&#39;all bitching about fast and furious not being all about racing anymore? Wasn&#39;t that always been the case? The racing was just part of it. It was never the center of the movies.

Fr Hobbes and Shaw was aight but it was the only movie I watched in a theatre and actually slept halfway so I never rly watched the end :(

Mortal fools who will in a few years think, I did not need to go there, I sucked at being a human being.

I will be back to normal Vince bought copyrights franchise an so to get rig of the Rock  Vince has big big plans  walked is a bully and controlling and is that the first time from other projects and keeping it short not so sweet

Who ever grows hair first wins.

&#39;I&#39;m a rich and badass actor but I am so pissed and butt hurt because someone called me a name!&#39; Wow that&#39;s hilarious.

It&#39;s crazy how they now become heist movies. They&#39;re pretty cool movies but the stunts are getting a little out of hand. Example ff9, car swing. Oh and the rock holding the helicopter with one arm. Please end the movies already

Tyrese is stealing youtube videos and posting it on Facebook and making money off of it don&#39;t blame someone else who is making money the legit way.

Gibson sounds like a big cry baby. So the Rock went on to do a spin off... Could you get anymore jelly dude? Wow..

When hobbs came that&#39;s the end of the fast.

They should know to let Dwayne Johnson in when they did I started stop watching it then who wont for the other guys I would have

Hobbs and Shaw took my too favorite characters Away from the one&#39;s I am not quite as fond of. IMO, WIN!!! I really enjoyed it.

Yeo

Everyone saying the movies went to shit, yet keeps watching them

Didn&#39;t the rock once say he sold his soul?

Fast and furious is overrated now, it&#39;s not a car franchise anymore,its a action movie franchise, it&#39;s not the same anymore

The rock&#39;s tearing the family apart. Js

Of course they will appear. It&#39;s all propaganda and they getting paid. Smart guys won&#39;t fret

The full story of why Tyrese didnt want Dwayne to do the hobs and shaw spin off is because Gibson was trying to gain custody of his child and hadn&#39;t received a paycheck since FF8 and since the ff9 was delayed Gibson didnt like Johnson very much after that whole thing

Oh please. Half that was supposedly aimed at Vin Diesel. Where do you get your info from, a cereal box ?This channel is worthless.

The comments on here saying I prefer the older ones true they were great but Without Johnson joining the franchise may have died off since ha joined fast 5 earned nearly double 4 and since then is raking it in. Unfortunately for more too be made the studios want money and he gets bums in seats. To compete with braindead Marvel trash. I know what people mean it&#39;s moved too much from the cars and racing, i&#39;m a Star Trek fan and hated the 3 recent movies because they were just trying to hit a broader range as audience as possible.

Many are expecting to see all the original cast in a movie together again maybe for the finale movie?

this wasn&#39;t a movie. this was some nunch of guys drive some cars,and some stunts. real movies have emotions,story.

I don&#39;t give a shit anymore. TRUMP 2020

I brought this movie it was fire

I gotta agree with Gibson, Hobbs &amp; Shaw was a success but it&#39;s just an action film tbh, has nothing to do with F&amp;F. If you ask me, the real fast and furious died when they stopped doing shit about street racing. Still enjoy the movies but it&#39;s not the same.

Roid’ Rage

Ever since the Rock came in and Paul died it hasn’t been the same. It’s not even about cars no more

Tyrese is a wave crashing against the Rock only to turn into spray and foam. It makes a splash but fades into nothing.

The rock took the fast and furious and made it his own film which was a pile of crap gone of wat the film is about fast cars not about the rock don&#39;t cast him in any other fast and furious films he took the piss

WHY PEOPLE HATE TYRESE FOR I WANNA KNOW

We all  love the rock  who  agrees

I hate to admit it but I do miss the old crew

Fighting over who gets to eat the children

Like both these dudes, but will take Tyrese in this one.  Not sure why DJ needed to stay longer than Bow Wow 

Who cares about Tyrese

<a href="">2:19</a> shy the hell would you censore that ?

Everyone complaining about the movie being less about street racing. Grow up. If we had street racing in 9 movies it would become so boring. Sure its over the top now but its refreshing and such a good franchise

The Rock is just beefing first with Gibson than with Vin Diesel

Yo the rock isn’t afraid to say what he wants to say damn 

The Rock was already an action star before all the furious stuff mate.

Is it just me or Tyrese has face that you would punch in the first second when you meet with him? Literally his attitude IRL and in movies (i know it’s acting) a crybaby?This is kind of a character that normally drives me away from a movie, too much whining of one character (main or support) can be problematic.I’ve seen all the FF movies, but somehow the last good one was when Paul Walker played in it. Since then, 100miles long airstrip, jumping from “space”, like a GI Joe copy of some sort.When the 1st The Fast &amp; The Furious released i was so hyped i’ve seen that like 10 or more times, the car racing or adrenalin it gives...every time i watch (even though i know most the lines know :D) also i was hyped for Vin Diesel simply because of his character Riddick (from Pitch Black).I know many of you don’t agree with me, but the The Fast &amp; The Furious ended with the 6th, then Vin and his team started losing fame and shifted to GIJOE mode.I like Rock and the character he portrays, he has weak and very strong movies, but i still think the FF is DYING and bleeding out slowly.Even just the Hobbs &amp; Shaw showed how much people like Rock/Statham (the end of the movie was really weak) if Vin Diesel would go back to racing and gang wars, that would generate even more revenue even get in to NFS games would up their image.It’s weird that even when the Expendables were able to get into one of the biggest characters under the same roof and weirdly enough they barely had any feud between them...nuff said, i think Tyrese is a crybaby!

Fast-5 was the best. They should have stopped when Paul died. All it is now is just rubbish.

Why would people care about a bunch of REALLY bad movies?

Still won’t watch Hobbs and Shaw.

Tyrese needs to freaking chill the hell out and when does Tyrese determine Dwayne The Rock Johnson can and cannot do stream ridiculous bury the hatchetstop acting like children and make a badass freaking fast and furious movie together

Tyrese is just salty he doesn&#39;t have any spin offs of his own. 

Tyrese who?

I “smell what the rock is cookin” and it smells like shit

I miss the street race vibes were Dom and Brian were the main focus, its different now since Paul left us

Am I the only one that finds this stupid

As much as I enjoyed the movies nothing and I mean nothing compared to the first.

Sounds to me that Tyrese Gibson is bipolar

Hobbs and Shaw will be big because they aren&#39;t about racing they are about like agency&#39;s and that&#39;s why I like them more than the recent F&amp;F it just became too crazy dfiving a car out of a building into another building into another building like come on it was about street racing now its like a superhero movie now lol

Dom dies in fast 9 , I’m calling it

Wow I really lost all my respect for the rock thought he was more of a grown-up than that however I expect this behavior from Tyrese

If the rock called him out do you think he would back out of a real fight

Also idk about the rock and being  a bonefide action star because of fast and furious. Y&#39;all know this rock but ik the rock from the rundown and scorpion king 1 plus the mummy returns.

Miss the movies where they were racing cars in the streets Dom was a legend Brian was a cop and the only bad guys were the other racers. This jumping from planes stopping terrorists taking down drug Lord&#39;s and even super soldiers. It&#39;s getting old

Looks to me throws was pissed because he had to wait to make new film was he run omg out of money

meh, i liked dwayne johnson in pain &amp; gain. this was a good role for him. but fast and furious? kinda cheesy tbh

IDK both are good but I would rather see tyrese stay just because he is hella funny and a OG

Hobbs and Shaw was a 5 star pile of shit!!

<b>I like both but Gibsen acted like a child in that post about H&amp;S just because HIS film was delayed</b>

The Rock is that Uncle we all have that invited himself over long ago and is still around today.

All my homies hate the rock

I love tyrese but it feels like he&#39;s the instigator most of the time

After Fast 7 the entire story died

The rock truly ruined the fast and the furious. It used to be about family, cars, hustling and had a meaningful story line.. Now its just a bunch of trash about the rock flexin his muscles... It doesn&#39;t seem authentic at all. To be honest he kinda just stepped in and took over the show like he was there from day 1 and he wasn&#39;t.. He def ruined it for me. I can def see where Tyrese was coming from and I think paul walker would have taken the side with him. And to repeat someones below comment. The fast and the furious was about dom, and Bryan. Everyone else was just an accessory. The show ended when Paul left. Hobbs and Shaw is a GI JOE movie.. has nothing to do with fast and the furious.

The rock was definitely a big Hollywood star before he was in fast and furious. They wanted a big star on the series that&#39;s is why they brought him into the series.

Dwayne&#39;s steroids keep screaming.

So big macho men can argue online like a bunch of children. Move on.

That doesn’t explain anything!

Romam: Mia better hide your baby oilHobbs: You better hide your big ass forehead 

4.43 can anyone recognized Roman reigns or it&#39;s just me ..

Gotta side with Tyrese here The Rock might of been being a little selfish when he took the Spin off and messed up by postings bout them like that

After fast and furious 4 it’s just like they added dlc characters to the movie

Honestly, Hobbs and Shaw was better than any other fast and furious series..

DJ STILL FCKEN NAILED ITNje

Well. Hobbs and Shaw did suck in my opinion so....

<a href="">4:55</a> <b>non superhero movie</b>Dom’s brother:Are you sure about that?

It&#39;s so sad that in f&amp;f9 there won&#39;t be The Rock in the film... even if it&#39;s correct because it had made a spin-off. The only thing that i wish is that, in f&amp;f10, they will all do peace, and everyone will be included in the film.Guys.... f&amp;f9 without the Rock is strange now.

F&amp;F Hobbs and shaw is basically a superhero film

Maybe they ran out of ideas for street racing and then they just randomly switched to action films

I&#39;m with the rock man



Gotta say, f&amp;f movies went to shit after Rock joined the crew

Caramba!!! Sem legenda em PORTUGUÊS! Muito triste 

RIP Paul Walker. We will all remember you forever

Ty belongs in the franchise, the rock is a garbage. Turned the F&amp;F into some cheesey stuff after he joined. Hobbs and Shaw should be flushed down the toilet, terrible movie.

I love the drama brother. Bottom line survival of the fittest... lol

Jesus, guys, Tyrese sounds salty af. Who the hell is he to tell dwayne what projects he should and shouldnt pick up? The job is to make money. Nothing more. After paul walker died they should have stopped there. Dwayne isnt ruining anything. Its an enjoyable movie with A list celebrities. Tyrese sounds more jealous than anything else.

Tyrese brings comedy in these movies and he has been there longer, a great team player, he should remain in the movies

Bring back The original cast of FAST &amp; FURIOUS. I watched all the movies and Hobbs and Shaw was boring to me. I always go back to watching the Fast and Furious when Vin And Paul was in it along with the original cast. It was much more interesting and fun to watch. Fast and Furious was about family and fast cars.

The thing with The Rock is always the same, the movies often suck because they are mostly about The Rock and not about the movies and it always looks like The Rock look the most of the budget and now the movie is just a Horse Shyte with a fairly good actor in it

Tryese

rock didn&#39;t give vin the reach around when he was banging his bum and then vin bricked in rock&#39;s mouth while he was taking a nap

I am a big fan of Dwayne and a big fan of  f&amp;f i agree with tyrese

No paul walker no FF period

The rock sucks

Honestly The Rock doesn’t have to fringe from Tyrese’s reaction cuz he’s the rock

They should&#39;ve just eneded it.

Im not going to lie i loved hobbs n shaw it was very entertaining, funny and i loved Vanessa kirby in it but maybe it couldve happend after f9

Why are they having beff with eachother they getting a big paycheck so why are they hating on each other man stupid actor&#39;s

Dewayne is totally &quot;straight&quot;. He&#39;s &quot;married&quot; to his loyal &quot;wife&quot;. Give it some time.

The movie was way better when it focused on fast cars and of course had the man himself Paul Walker in it

How does Gibson say that DJ was nothing  before FF, I mean people around the world  know DJ more than his candy ass, not just because of wrestling but because  he made great movies even before FF. Gibson is a jealous  wannabe  with average  talent in acting and singing thats why he can never be a lead actor in a good movie.

DJ is the Rock he does not argue with pebbles,  insted his success  does..Case closed!

people say there are not cars in Hobbs and Shaw however there are lots of scenes with cars and it is in fact a good film however fast and furious is always the best

The Rock is overrated, him and his three headed goat, where’s are leader, where’s are leader he says, he’s a fool. Stay out of politics Rock.

Literally the exact same 100% story used to &quot;what happened between the rock and vin diesel&quot;.. Talk about zero credibility channel.

The only reason hobbs and shaw was a hella good film was because of jason statham not the rock. They could have used vin diesel and it would have made it even better

Tyrese has since left his wife. Converted to Islam.

Who is Tyrese Gibson?

In the FF Franchise post-Walker, Ludacris the only guy with hair.

They are extras to the story. Shut them both up and cut them out. Stop feeding and rewarding drama. I like them both but come on here. They both are acting like high school kids. I liked Hobbs and Shaw but it didn&#39;t belong with F&amp;F franchise and one doesn&#39;t take a solo role to help open doors for others. It is what it is... a solo role but hey it&#39;s his kids mouths he has to feed and I get it but be honest. F&amp;F is not why it use to be and can never be without paul walker. Trying to add him after he passed is not the same. It&#39;s like TLC performing without Left eye. It&#39;s just incomplete and not worth watching even though you know the other two are still good. The feeling isn&#39;t the same.

The franchise should have end with Paul where scene where Dom and brain said goodbye

Anyone else realize that when The Rock came in, there was virtually no more street racing? In fast 4, there was at least a street race, then that desert scene, but literally no racing after fast 5. Fast 8 don&#39;t count either.

The Rock: Dwayne  Johnson  is a snob in my opinion..

Hobbs and Shaw was terrible. I think the high grossing numbers were due to name recognition and hype.

No matter how many things you show blowing up, nothing will ever beat the ending race in FF1  between Dom’s charger and Brian’s Supra.

LOVE the ROCK!!! I WISH they would Blow up Tyrese&#39;s CORNY Character!!! He&#39;s such a PATHETIC CRY BABY!!!! They should replace Roman&#39;s character with the HANDSOME guy from GIRL&#39;S TRIP!!!

I love the Rock!!!!!!!!!!

Franchise should of stoped at 7. The send off to Paul Walker was the perfect way to end it.

He didn&#39;t become a action star till fast and furious?  Do u live in a hole?

Wait is it a success cause of rock or statham aww remember he&#39;s just as famous as he is

The best movie

Honestly, who cares?! The current Fast and the Furious movies SUCK anyway!! I enjoyed the first three and then after that it all went downhill and was basically just Vin Diesel going back to the well after a bunch of his other movies didn&#39;t do so well. Just saying

I&#39;ve never liked Dwayne he was always so self centered. This was from since wwe. When he joined F&amp;F I was sooo pissed. F&amp;F 5 was the last I had watched until recently... I had no idea of all this. I did hear someone saying they had some falling out on H&amp;S being released first but never knew to this extent....

The Real Fast And Furious Franchise Ended When Paul Walker Died :(

Figures The Rock is getting selfabsorbed and sorry he&#39;s not the best ..Van Deosel and the arigunal crew makes the movies not the Rock ..

Let’s be honest... Literally NO ONE asked for the rock to join the franchise

Tyrese is just petty and jealous. He should grow.

Nobody might support Tyrese among the fraternity, but they all know he ain&#39;t lying....dwayne is just a self centred showman

Hobbs and Shaw delayed F9 now that ain&#39;t family

Has anybody ever wondered what kind of a legendary dish is it that the rock is cooking and no one can smell it

For those complaining about the movies they&#39;re supposed to be in sets of 3 1-2-3 were racing movies 4-5-6 hiest 7-8-9 helping the government, would you guys still want them street racing 9 movies later?

Fast and furious 85 plot leak: Area 51 releases laser shark dinosaurs into the city of New York and Don has to use car-fu to blow the laser shark dinosaurs up into space where they finish the fight in space

&quot;Hobbs and Shaw&quot; doesn&#39;t deserve to be  in  fast and furious franchise There&#39;s no cars .no family. It&#39;s just superman in the movie

they r both good actors....i like the. both there is no winner or loser...

After paul walker&#39;s death, the family is just in the movie now, it used to be a real family but now its not.. Rip paul

For me .. the franchise was ended after the death of Paul Waker. This franchise  supposed be about amazing fast cars but not anymore. Anyway who the hell is Mr. Nobody ? Is he belong to the family too

What people do for money

Two bald men going at it

Well i liked the spin off want fast and furious but was still fun to watch

‍️‍️‍️‍️



the fact is and people need  to get it through  their stupid heads the rock is a better actor&#39; makes more money .he will always be better than Roman_ Gibson. If you smell what The Rock is cooking.  And if Tyrese Gibson didn&#39;t get the role in 2fast and 2furious and the rest of their franchise he wouldn&#39;t be nothing. he wouldn&#39;t be a star..

<a href="">4:54</a> lol non-superhero? I thought Brickson was black Superman lmao  

hobbs and shaw was the best non superhero movie non disney movie of the year. key word year fast and furious movies come every two years so it was not a real hit to him at all ha

Johnson started it 

Tyrese:  &quot;You taking some of my money!&quot;

The rock would beat Teresa easy

This all started from “you better hide that big ass forehead”

tyrese is a fckn joker..no wsy near what he should be in this kind of movies

“You better hide that big ass forehead”

Lets be honest if Vin hadn&#39;t had such a problem with Dwayne showing up to the F&amp;F series then Tyrese wouldn&#39;t have a problem with Dwayne, honestly Tyrese is a bit of a clown, i love the guy and think he&#39;s a brilliant actor, but he&#39;s had several mental breakdowns and posted them all over social media, he asked Dwayne to not make a movie which has nothing to do with F&amp;F except for their names, there are no references to F&amp;F in the movie, so in no way really affects Tyrese in any way shape or form, unfortunately the movies haven&#39;t been the same since Paul Walker was taken from us, if anything, if they have any love for Paul like the actors say they do, surely they will put aside their &quot;differences&quot; and make the movies for their brother.

Tbh I wouldn&#39;t care if Gibson is in the movies.

The last time i enjoyed watching is FF5.After paul gone FF never be the same

&quot;Hey Mia, better hide your baby oil :D&quot;&quot;you better hide that big ass forehead&quot;&quot; :/ &quot;

we&#39;ll never get the old fast and furious vibes back :(

Tbh, If I was instead of Dwayne, I wouldn&#39;t even start a beef with someone whose whole career is based on 1 movie

Tyrese is a clown. He can&#39;t stand it when someone else is more famous than he is. He broke up TGT because he wanted to be paid more than the others. TGT was an American supergroup that consisted of R&amp;B singers Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank. TGT is named after the first letter of each of the trio&#39;s stage names. He wanted his name first and he wanted 80 percent of the profits because he claimed to be a more famous draw for concerts.  Karma is a bitch...So happy the Rock put him in his place.

Imagine thinking the rock wasn’t an action star till he joined this declining franchise

I feel like he’s dragging it Hobbs and Shaw doesn’t take way from fast and furious. Fast and furious will always be there.

...GIBSON, IF YOU WANT TO BEAT UP SOMEONE, BEAT UP CHARLIZE THERON...

Bring Chris Tucker to solve this matter

Rocks boring...need Tyrese back

Why does everyone miss the old fast and furious Dom is all about family this and family that I prefer Dwayne and Jason Statham with all that action they provide.

Tbh the f&amp;f is so different now i miss the street racing and about cars now it&#39;s like a damn action movie!

Come on. Fast and Furious lost its way back when it stopped being about illegal street racing and became all about GTA styled shennanigans, outlandish heists, government conspiracies and shit.

F&amp;F 1 and 2, maybe even tokio drift. The rest is just some action film. I lile the rock and i care about him more than about Tyrese, but i dont really need him in FF. My man/s there is was and always will be Dom and Brian. All the new big names... thats cool stuff but not FF

Fast and furious ended after tokyo drift smd

Tyrese talks about haters yet it’s clear he’s the biggest one. He’s mad cause he’ll never pull the same numbers as The Rock

The fast family f10 will be called dwaynes family.. 

Just come to DC Dwayne

ILLUMINATE

It’s funny how tyrese fell off

Fast and Furious 2 was technically a spinoff

Once the rock has been in ff it&#39;s been shit

Since paul died they shouldnt Continue these Fast and Furiouses

I hope everyone can put their differences aside for the grand finale in the 10th film.

Anybody here skip the hobbs and shaw movie?

There is so much money to be made and fame to be spread. I&#39;m sick of theses Hollywood boys acting like they don&#39;t eat well.

Hahaha,  bring big hitters  to the park ,expect  nothing  less , it&#39;s  not about  who is not here , no one is questioning  is questioning  that ,

well... i didnt watch any Fast before The Rock acted in it...

Say it with me &quot;it is no longer the Fast Franchise it&#39;s Rock self suckfest&quot;

It’s the biggest piece of dogshit

All this beef is about money. No one want the other to make more money then himself, thats it. The rich people always want to get richer and dont share.

But the rock had world wide fame before he joind f&amp;f idc i love him nohomo tho

Where there is Statham, Ill be there

That looks like pure jealousy to me! Family is not the reason they do not go solo, It&#39;s because no one on the cast is a leading Actor! Really, Could you really pic a movie where Tyrese is the lead character? He is the plus 1!

FaF was ruined the second the 6th movie was made. At that point it wasn’t even about cars anymore.

I don&#39;t understand why these people say fast and furious was good ,,, when it was about cars and racing ... I don&#39;t think so this movie is making money and reaching world wide only because of action scenes

They arguing like baby&#39;s haha . Well is there&#39;s no Roman then put instead a conor McGregor or a character like dat .Who da foook is da

Tokyo drift was the last decent fast and furious it’s barely even about the cars anymore

Hobbs and Shaw sucked without the fast family

I love the Rock, and i thought the Hobs &amp; Shaw was kinda a good movie, but if the Rock is there and Tyrese isnt, I&#39;d rather have Tyrese rather than the Rock

Clash of bald heads

All the f&amp;f franchise needs is an ending. No character arcs no realism based in a real world etc. First one maybe two were ok. Btw Tyrese and his bullshit one-liners are of as much use to the movie as a picture of Oxygen to a drowning man. Eventually it will die..

I would rather choose million times with Tyrese than just a baby oil.

I like the old F&amp;F  just normal racing in streets . Normal people not exaggerated scene . Like Tokyo drift

These comments sayin..”its not all about cars anymore” well stop pretending that you dont watch f&amp;f series like you really dont like it.... all f&amp;f film are good as long as the characters stay... idiots

Wow

I hate the rock

I swear Dwayne is trying to become the main character in this franchise, for real, I&#39;d rather have Tyrese stay for the next movies than him.

Never seen a F&amp;F movie but I choose Tyrese, he cuter 

the main characters in the fast and the furious are paul walker ( as Brian, the fast)... and vin diesel ( as Dom, the furious)... and all the rest are support characters... the franchise start as street raising movie but unfortunately after paul walker die the franchise turned from street race to another random action movie

Hobbs and Shaw spinoff existed because the franchise is dying and needed to revived it, give it fresh start.

Ff become a shit hole now

I still adore the first Fast and the Furious movie.  I really don&#39;t even acknowledge the others.  It went from a semi-realistic/grounded story about an intriguing and mystifying underground illegal street racing scene,  added with a nice dash of heist drama and focused on family values (not the typical type),  to a completely over the top, stupid &quot;check your brain at the door&quot; schlock fest.  I did watch most except the last 2 installments. I couldn&#39;t bare it any longer. The FF franchise is dead to me and stays only with the first installment.

I want to see Roman in Fast 9 because he, Brian, Dom, Lerry, Tej and Mia are the real main characters...

Hobbs and Shaw is an average movie at best. It succeeded because of the love people have for the already super successful franchise.

I&#39;m siding with Rock. Let&#39;s be honest here even if Paul was alive, this franchise wouldn&#39;t have gone anywhere past FF4. The rock saved the franchise. People be complaining how these movies used to be bout street racing.. look around you, street racing culture is dying especially in USA with cops having better tech, Dawn of Teslas, more traffic. Which other franchise makes movies bout street racing in this decade you tell me.

Tf Hobbs &amp; shaw was terrible

Hobbs and Shaw was good tho

two bald men arguing over a comb ‍️

Im glad F9 has gone back to Focusing more on Dom’s life (i.e his brother).I miss the days when Dom and Brian were the main focus

Tyrese is 100% right, the rock should leave the fast family. Tyrese is way more years in it, he can&#39;t leave

<a href="">4:57</a> I see what you did there

Tyrese should have played the main villain in Hobbs &amp; Shaw 

Idfc about tyrese. Dwayne is 100000000x a better actor so get tf out blackman

I never went to see it but I guess I&#39;m only one that remembers when fast and furious was at its best

Dawyen is wayy up ahead than tyrese

I love Dwayne Johnson, hi is the sexiest man on earth.

Tyrese is a B grade movie star. He knows he’s never going to be offered a spinoff so he lashes out at Dwayne in the pretext of “family “. He’s just a jealous loser who needs to be thankful enough to be cast in these shitty movies. Imagine if every avenger started acting out for not having their own movie.

This clearly shows The Rock have a problem with EVERYONE. I think he should just stick to WWE instead. But Im wondering does he has any feud in Jumanji.....

In my mother tongue...Gibson se ma se Poes! Fok hom!

I love the rock and its not his fault but the rock kinda ruined the point of fast and furious and turned it into a action franchise not a car franchise

Lol all the beef started with the &quot;U BETTER HIDE UR BABY O&quot; &quot;U BETTER  HIDE UR BIG ASS FOREHEAD&quot;

Why cant they all just love each other and not spoil the movie for us

Hobbs and Shaw was very mediocre in my honest opinion, just a plain old action film, no passion for cars

They both bald tho

I feel like we either need FF to completely get rid of all the GI Joe crap or have someone make a whole new series created about street racing- i feel like the majority of OG fans are sick of the new films and just waiting for either a new series or for FF to go back to its roots. Imagine all the modern JDM cars- Civic R, Supra, NSX, 86, BRZ and all the classics from the earlier FF films in a street racing film. I guess all we can do is sit and pray someone makes such a film. I feel like the FF franchise went downhill when paul walker passed- man i miss him, RIP 

That clip of Dwayne Johnson roasting the album is taken out of context. Very, very out of context.

I don’t know about yall but if you follow The Rock’s instagram he’s quite a nice and loving guy, and I bet Tyrese is as well. But before we all start taking sides due to our own judgements, just know that nobody knows the truth of what’s really happening behind the scenes.

Hobbs and shaw Was about <b>hobbs and shaw and the lmini black widow</b>While FnF was all about *Dom oh (brian)  Now thats called family

How would you feel if you were there from the start of a two decade, billion dollar franchise and get side railed by a new edition that gets his own spin off movie?

F&amp;F is about both great racer Brian (Paul) and Toretto (Vin Diesel). When late Paul left us after a tragic accident. There is no more shine for the franchise anymore. &quot;Things are gonne be different now&quot;. I respect Dwayne for his participating with F&amp;F. He brought this franchise to another level. But without Paul, for me, there is something missing.

I watch FF only because of the Rock! And who in the blue hell is tyrese gibson?

It was really obvious that the rock carisma and talent was going to take over those movies

I find Dwayne Johnson movie boring

I feel bad for Tyrese be he should find other opportunities to make money and support his daughter. The rock is just tryna be great ‍️

A fan of cars for decades, a fan of F&amp;F especially the first 3, I&#39;d say F&amp;F needs not to be prolonged until even Fast 5...it has gradually lost its main story about street racing &amp; tuning, too many dramas and fantasy-movie-like actions, if they&#39;re trying to bring F&amp;F to its 9th, just stop supporting the movie already. No more real F&amp;F soul.

If tyrese where to smell what the rock is cooking....he would smell it after the rock ate it and pass it out the other end lmao!!!

Since Therock is there its more like Expandable than fast and furious...

nobody:Tyrese: familythe rock: candy ass

From what I’ve seen in the comments about The Rock is all about himself, I understand these came from people who only know him when he started appearing in movies. Try looking for backstage stories during his wrestling days. He was always there to push younger talents.

Tyrese was right he&#39;s just tryna keep fast and the furious the way it always was. The knew Hobbs and shaw movie is good but it should have not have had the fast and furious title.

Cryrese  is a broke crybaby

Why the drama? True fans stopped watching the movies after Paul passed. Any F&amp;F movie without Paul , is not considered a F&amp;F .

Anybody else not know who tf tyrese Gibson was until now.

Soooo sad. I love them both.

I still dont understand shit, just two grown ass adults making tons of money trying to shove it into each others face..

Tyrese is mad cuz he doesn&#39;t have anything else going on in his career. Lol the rock is Killin every yr, Vin diesel is F&amp;F and has other movies. The rest only have F&amp;F.

oof

Sad no Popcorn

In a move there is only one room for one  hero like Dwayne Johnson

Neither because they are actually acting like kids and tht is very very irritating!

GOD PLS BRING BACK.PAUL WALKER SO THAT we can watch the real.F&amp;F scene not this high tech super cars or.whatsoever

They just do it for money  Money talks

Why they making all these fast and furious movies there not even good anymore enough is enough

They wild. Gotta manage your money better.

There&#39;s not much Dwayne wouldn&#39;t do for cash. I&#39;m a fan of the rock but I think he sold out the F&amp;F franchise.

please let them be in f9 all of them ,and imo since jakob torreto is the main focus he and his brother should kill each other and then there goes the coffin scene and end

Hobbs and Shaw really wasn’t that good ‍️

Probably if they bring Paul&#39;s brother Cody into the mix with his own features,good producers and directors, the franchise could be reborn for the next generation.

Two key points you left out....  Gibson had one movie role before he joined the F&amp;F franchise  - the Rock had nearly 20.  The Rock brought something to the franchise in his first appearance that Gibson did not bring to his.  Secondly Gibson continues to make money with his music.  Asking Johnson to give up a paycheque but not doing the spinoff would be like if Johnson asked him to stop making music.  They make their money in their own ways.

I feel like there is space for Dwayne Johnson in the franchise fast and furious, the franchise ended with Paul walker dying in a car accident, they could of finished the movie (the end) by not creating anymore movie. but then the producer decides to carry on making more movies which I didn&#39;t mind. fast and furious doesn&#39;t have to be about cars, Im enjoying it with action scenes and Other story lines. adding Jason Statham and the black superman (Idris Elba) to the mix hobbs and shaw. fast and furious has become on fire 

It just tyrese makes me feel the real F&amp;F and reminds of paul walker

When he said its all about the f wrd in my head i actually said family G cause not gonna lie usually i assume f*ck

We need one scene of racing

Hobbs and shaw didn&#39;t make that kind of cash

This guy sounds like MrRoflWaffles wtf

i thought the one who had a fight is between johnson &amp; diesel, turns out tyrese too?

Family, what family is Tyrese speaking about? Film Franchises and crews may have common interests, but they ain;t no family. Hollywood is similar to politics, there are always selfish interests involved and people always watch their back. There are no best friends or enemies, maybe exceptions, but generally, it is every man for himself.

Fast and furious is dog shit now, especially the 8th one. Hobbs and shaw was waaaay better

With all of the things Tyrese Gibson has lied about im having a hard time beleiveing what he is saying true, and one of the  things I don&#39;t understand is why is he not showing any anger towards Jason Statham for agreeing to do the spinoff as well

The Rock is boring as hell, I don&#39;t watch any of his movies.

love the franchise.  but I definitely miss the premise of it.  the first 2, arguably 3......were about the cars and the racing.

Hobbs and Shaw was a pretty good movie..full on actions and some comedy...a great spinoff for me..but however I would love more car racing involving would be good..

Hobbs and shaw sucked

Hobbs was boring...turned it off

franchise is already messed up, whys he caring so much now? if faf 9 is terrible thatll be it .

Wow they both acted like kids

It is a super hero movie. Lol!

Remind me again what exactly happened again..?

I wouldn’t ever y’all shit to the Rock not because he would wipe me from existence but also because he talks mega good shit talk from his wrestling days.

Tokyo Drift was a spinoff, why is he just now getting pissed off?

F&amp;F Sucks, I watch some of the first one and Tokyo Drift, Watched all of Paul Walkers last one. Played out commercial series.

The Fast and Furious franchise needs to end. 9 is too much

Dwayne can not act full stop his eyebrow makes more sense than the ham fisted crap ojt of his mouth

I like Hobbs but he is not needed in every movie.  Roman we do need and I wish Vince wasn’t really dead.

I miss Vince.

Since The Rock came, F&amp;F are now overrated and they overdoing things. Tyrese Gibson is damn right!

I admit I did eventually rent the movie, but only because of Statham, not The Crock. I refused to go to the theater &amp; feed the box office and The Tick&#39;s ever growing big head.

Brian&#39;s role sucked &amp; Tokyo drift way the last good car movie. Who liked 2f2f only thing good to come out of that was Ludacris

I watched the movie at the theatre ..I left actually wanting my money back...there were so many parts I guess were supposed to be comical but we’re corny...I did like the action but it wasn’t the fast and furious...they need to bring that back

He is just jealous of rock

Business is business. Spin offs happen. Get over it. Both are great actors.

We all know the reason theres hobbs and shaw is to have additional female character for the fast &amp; furious 10 and to balance 2teams by dom and hobss which is like civil type of shit in the end they work to kill keenu reeves the last enemy and the one who&#39;s behind the hobbs and shaw

I just wanna say this,dwayne johnson is not funny,I laughed in jumanji the next level because of the writers making there roles old,but other than that,the rock&#39;s other films is trash to me,unless he&#39;s with kevin hart

Let&#39;s be honest. They should have stopped after Tokyo Drift......

Fast and Furious wasn&#39;t about the cars it was about &quot;Family&quot; and if you don&#39;t believe me. Ask Vin! Yea sure there were alot of cars and tricked out rides, but it has been and always will be about &quot;Family&quot;.

The best way to fight haters is with success 

The Rock is such a phony, everyone that is REAL and honest, he pisses everyone else off

Great things about My lejand the Best the rock

This &quot;Family&quot; shtick is cringe. Y&#39;ALL ARE ACTORS YOU ABSOLUTE TRUNK.

Sted head

wellllll..... Dwayne The RockoJohnson  ??????? the fist line you say... cant you speak or what ?

Everybody knows someone just like the Rock.. everything has to be about them and themselves alone..

I’m pretty sure he became a bonafide action star with the Scorpion King. He was an instant hit.

Hobbs and Shaw was shit in my opinion and the car enthusiast perspective now it’s all explosions and gun shots it’s more of the same shit sad to see what such great franchise has turned into

I could care less about Tyrese it’s not that famous I don’t even remember what he’s famous for

Why is Tyrese hating, it&#39;s a shame I like his music, but he makes absolutely no sense

Who cares, not about the cars and racing anymore. I gave up seeing these, not worth the money. Street racers aren’t special ops!

Tyrese , without Fast and furious you are nothing , while The rock has done more then just 1 stupid shit .

This whole thing started when Paul Walker died. Dwayne was pissed because there were days that Vin wouldn&#39;t work and when he did he would get angry or sad for &quot;No Reason&quot;. Dwayne couldn&#39;t understand how close Vin and Paul were and how much it hurt. He couldn&#39;t understand why it would affect Vin doing his job. It still pisses me off.Tyrese just needs to grow up.

Hmmm #9 WTF?!Move on damn.......

Tyrese is the most useless character. I’d be salty too

Tyrese is useless Go the Rock

Rich people being petty.

Tyrese sounds like a hater to me.

I love all your movies but I&#39;ll be honest with you you guys make way too much money not to get along.

I think it&#39;s so funny that these celebrities fight over the stupidest things seriously. The rock is played out he&#39;s in everything trying to be another Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone and Tyrese I can&#39;t say too much but he just whines too much grow up bro

I’m so over hearing about the rock most over rated actor in history the rock is to the movie industry as DJ Khadel is to the music industry just put his face and name to anything to make a buck with no quality at all

Dwayne Johnson with an ego that big would literally kill a man just to be the next runner up on a big movie slot... smfh he wasn’t like this as a wrestler

I do agree that they are trying to make the Fast movies about the Rock. Why did we need a spin-off movie. We are hear to see Dom and the crew race and commit robberies. The movies have fallen off along time ago.

No candy asses apply

Tyrese Gibson doesn&#39;t know why they did the Hobbs and Shaw??? It was to tell the audience why they(Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw) weren&#39;t in the Fast and Furious 9, It&#39;s not only JUST about FAMILY. If he is jealous about it, why don&#39;t he make a spin off about how his character and Paul Walker&#39;s character end up being enemies in F&amp;F 2...

No one would miss Tyrese&#39;s character any way.

When DK coming back??

The man with the shiniest head wins

Rock is just a narcissistic dip shit.

The real fast and furious was about cars not super human heroes the 1st was the real and only original

The man slept with him once now he feel The Rock and him in a whole relationship, so he wants to dictate the man&#39;s life and career choices. He know what he was getting himself into; stop being clingy Tyrese LOL. 

That movie didnt do great bec of the rock lol

The fast family died when Paul passed! The rock made them better movies plus always hated Gibson&#39;s character anyway. Candy ass clown

The blame cannot be put on any of the actors, it&#39;s more to do with the writers and all the guys in charge of the franchise.And yeah it&#39;s funny how all the drama started after Paul Walker passed

Tyrese needs to chill the rock so making money that&#39;s offered to him hes just mad hes not making as much as him what was that one thing the 5 million he was supposed to get from will smith and will smith said he full of shit

<a href="">5:00</a> I mean I was guessing Mac and cheese but that works to I guess

Fast and Furious didn&#39;t start with Tyrese or the Rock....neither of them are the original actors in Fast and Furious....they both need to quit crying about each other being in the movies...they both SUCK at acting equally.

Something isn’t right and probably not adding up with Tyrese’s issue. He makes it seem like HE’s written the rules that if anyone goes and venture on to business movie deals and other film works, etc; you’re “braking the family” honour code. Dwayne has been a bankable film star in his own rights he’s entitled to ensue other film projects, like wtf ..

Stop putting rocks in movies !

Rock. Destroy. The fast in furious movie. I’m still like the original cast in fast in furious ,,,smasssshhh!

I like them both but the Rock has a bad serious complex because he thinks he is a white man but the world see him as a black man which that is what he is. The Rock forgot that for awhile and was acting superior. Hopefully the reality of life will more projects for all the men instead of one big headed man who&#39;s ego is swollen.

Looool the editing is great stuff I’m here laughing my ass off with these lil clips that go with the information nice video

Do you smell what the crock ( of shit) is cooking ?

Can you blame the rock? Growing his name and his fortune. Why wouldn&#39;t he? But I definitely agree with tyrese. He&#39;s right

The rock isn’t in fast and furious 9, but I hope they fast and furious 10 with the rock in it...

Come on Cryrese !. This is called business people !..If the shoe was on the other foot and Tyrese was offered a spin off,I’m sure he would jump on the opportunity in a minute !!The Rock doesn’t owe any one anything but himself..If this clown keeps up with his crying &amp; complaining ,sooner or later Tyrese is gonna find himself outta of a job FAST and FURIOUS !

Hobbs and shaw was very bad

This not a fight just to man strong arms one another . As a fan we love you all god blessed you all to be better as professional and real  this manner is what is killing are places things also family’s all over the world daily no more important to focus on faith stop be your self in righteousness of god.

TLDR: Please

Rock just wants money... Tyrese still hurting after Paul

Guys it’s not just hobs an Shaw. Fast an furious is literally just explosions special effects an over dramatic unrealistic scenarios now. At this point I wouldn’t be surprised if optomus prime made a cameo. They need to go back to focusing more on the cars an racing.

I couldn&#39;t give a shit about Hobbs and Shaw and the other fast movies after the 6th.. and many fans dont even like the fact that they made a 6th..

Earn that beating Tyrese.

Tyrese knows damn good and well his broke ass will be in Fast 9.

I&#39;d rather see spinoffs than sequels after Paul Walker died.

That was vin diesel not tyrees

I like D.J back then when he was a the real &quot;The Rock&quot; with a million..................Of the the Rock fans.Whooping Cena&#39;s candy ass.

Fast n furious died out after Tokyo drift. They needed the rock to save the fnf franchise

I&#39;d think that they are both professionals and the whole thing is just a marketing stunt.

F&amp;F lost its roots pure passion for cars , racing , mods , now it&#39;s all about g.i joe shit .

Both of them ..Why just enter the Octagon sort this shit out ..  instead of using social media to dispute this shit.... two keyboard Warriors...

Haven’t watched since part 7. That ending was beautiful &amp; they tarnished it.

Haha baby boy get big

Unfortunately, this feud is not unique to the franchise as Dwayne had been feuding with Vin as well.

I dont even watch fnf anymore

Best fast and furious was the first, second and fast five.

Tyrese right though they&#39;ve actually bonded and became family since 2F2F.

I support rock.

Gibson is just jealous. He ain&#39;t a leading actor.

I hope so this is crystal Sanchez I am using my brother&#39;s phone and hoping everyone has the equally has a role and also could be just a miss understanding for all but I believe everyone can forgive but never forget to anything problems that are big or small and only reinventing helping sharing a moment emotional relationship that with time everyone everything in every shape way or form can reunite and prosper not in any way make any harmful or feelings of anything anyone have doubt hurt or bully in one&#39;s heart because as we all know we are all God&#39;s children whatever the case with this problem was big or small letting evil in your heart and say I am a great person is not 100% greatness its 99.9 great but 1% ugly and that&#39;s real talk even if anyone throws ugly at some first showing beautiful will make a mother and father proud even if one&#39;s parents maybe had not been the greatest one can change history to a chain of maybe or maybe not a bad family so I guess what my point is being a bigger person is always a great thing to share  and if that person does not change that is when you Simply remove them

To be honest I stopped after Tokyo so..... Idk what&#39;s going on lol

the rock ..... f and f was for me Brian ...with a little Dom .. .so the franchise ended with Paul ...RIP .... Tyrese is just mad he didnt get a spinoff and i le loved overal compared to the rock .... I miss the old F&amp;F ... true core about cars...racing  .....  movies now were more about surreal action scenes.... so i dont mind a spinoff with my 2 favo chars in the franchise (Dom dropped on my list with Brian not arround)

$$$$$$&gt;EGO&lt;$$$$$$

This looked like to dudes slapping each other with white gloves

Fast and furious was dead when we losg paul walker

Why are these actors getting all person over a movie...

After seeing him in aquaman I want Jason manoa to return as a main character

They&#39;re 40 year old men. Let that sink in.

What if it&#39;s actually a made up drama to promote the franchise

Ermmm he was a star before fast and furious

Tomato rock is no professional how you going to go to someone&#39;s home and disrespect them. That was a franchise family and he just went in there and like disrespected them. I don&#39;t know why people say that the rock made Fast and Furious a billion dollars. No Fast and Furious. It was a hit before the rocky Came in.

THE ROCK SUCK&#39;S BETTER IN FUNNY MOVIE&#39;S SHOULD KEEP HIS BIG DUMB ASS WHERE HE  IS GOOD

If Universal stop this franchise in FF7 when Paul died, this franchise would be a legend like Avengers.They just ruined it!The worst is they make Han&#39;s back to live and John Cena become Dominic brother??? Come on!!!It all start from street racing until Dom can hold a flip car with his bare hands in new trailer FF9!!!!!Thats weird as sh*t!Sorry if my english bad.

Paul walker left that should of been the end of it, but johnson gotta have something to do

Both of them sound like children to me.

Well, Tyrese is right : The Rock tries to be the Star in so many movies out there. There was no need for a spin off in FF movies, so clearly did it for money, and besides, The Rock is not a good actor, just punchlines and muscles...

The rock is everywhere right now...used to like him,but now most fan will be exhausted with him. He is a newcomer to the franchise and yet act gansters and pretend to lead the franchise...tired of his bullshiy already

Lol FAF ended once Paul passed. Get over it Gibson, and quit pretending you&#39;re a good actor. He&#39;s just pissed because everyone likes the Rock.

I’m with tyrese

the rock seems have problems with more then one male co-star

Y’all ain’t have to point out he misspelled his characters’ name, Tyrese need to stop being emotional

F&amp;F isn’t about cars anymore. It’s just about acting now...I miss the old one 

You&#39;re not always going to like the people you work with this doesn&#39;t exclude Hollywood. They&#39;re there to make the best movie ever, that needs to be the main focus.

Dwayne is just riding the &quot;success&quot; of a dead man. Paul was the heart of F&amp;F franchise along with Vin. The fact that they could have made spin-offs and chose not to and then AFTER paul passes Dwayne comes in to change that. Honestly it really does piss me off, and the amount of respect lost for Dwayne is sad. Neither Dwayne nor Jason should have agreed to a spin off. You want to talk about &quot;The best way to shut the mouth of a clown is to flex your success&quot;, the success he did not help build. By the time Dwayne came into F&amp;F the franchise was already set in stone as one of the best and most successful franchises in the world. Hell yes if my friends success was being pushed to the side to be rode on by a man who was using his death to steal that success and say it&#39;s his.

Bald folks always beefin 

family has been broken since fast 6 up to the latest movies of the fast franchise its called fast and furious for a reason family first second street cars and third they need to be goddamned fast

If Rock wants to take over Furious to make it about him then he has no business in franchise.

It&#39;s not all about racing anymore though... Miss the old days, but still loving every action

Idk dwayne can be a such a douchebag

You better hide that big ass Forehead.

Paul would be so Disappointed with the Current disputes over the fast franchise

Vin Diesel Is The World&#39;s Worst Actor if that what you call it? his one liners Horrible

Rock will kick your Ass Tyrese

After Tokyo drift I stoped watching this franchise.

Did you folks here the entry dialog...thats crap so The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King , Walking Tall, Doom ,  Faster, The Game Plan  among many others didn&#39;t make him a superstar lol....the mere fact they choose to inject him into the franchise (to boost it -  at the time) speaks to the size of star that he way way before the FF series

I love Rock and all but FF was my jam. I loved FF cuz it was about FAMILY. I loved it when after movies, everyone would rev their cars. Now, people just flex their muscle after the movie. Its sad.

Lmfao tyres calling the rock a clown is hilarious bruh your the clown in and out the movies, comic relief in movies and begging for money online

i thought he had beef with jason statham

Paul walker in the new fast furious 

I agree. Once Paul died- the films died with him.

I wonder how many times we gonna hear vin diesel say one last time

never goin be the same without Paul walker .

Hobbs and Shaw sucked bad, thank god I didn&#39;t waste my money to go see it.

I&#39;ll be honest. I stopped caring about Fast and Furious as soon as Paul Walker stopped being in it... Haven&#39;t seen either Fast 8 or Hobbs and Shaw but they both look piles of over the top, action packed (not in a goodway) bullshit.

Fast and furious....Is it about CARS ?? FAMILY??  Need to confirm.

i agree with tyrese , if vin n paul didn’t want a spinoff neither should they. paul is the main reason why it’s here today so i get it ..

Cuz family

This is just attention for the new movie that is all. Cheap publicity.

Don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civic&#39;s with spoon engines. On top of that he just came into Harry&#39;s and ordered 3 t66 turbo&#39;s with NOS&#39;s and a Motec System Exhaust.

Actually this didn&#39;t even start with Tyrese and the rock. It was between the Rock and Vin Diesel and their feud. Tyrese came to Vin&#39;s defense but went far more public with all of it and dragged it on.

The rock

Tyrese mad he did get a cut

Glad marvel doesn&#39;t like taking in big stars like the rock, that would&#39;ve ruin the whole franchise

I liked them better when they were bad

The rock does the same style movies &amp; now he’s played out now Tyrese is not a good actor he’s barely a good singer I can live without either of them on the FAST AND FURIOUS just make sure VIN is there and I’ll be in the theater watching after all it’s about him and his friends. Hey rock go take more steroids

I admire the rock. But I&#39;m riding with Tyrese on this one.

Hobbs and shaw is b.s movie bruh

The Rock.... Has over killed F&amp;F,,, And he is also the highest paid star out there,,, Now F&amp;F,, Has turned into who can bring the most attention.. Now F&amp;F 9 Cena is in it, as Dom&#39;s Brother? How many old wrestlers, gonna mess us this movie??.

How do you play checkers? Lol

When fast &amp; furious wasn’t street racing no more and guns and transporter it died

I&#39;m on Tyreses side

Hobbs and Shaw was a great movie. But as a stand alone film, not to be associated with the F&amp;F franchise

Point of the story is, don&#39;t live beyond your means.

Thoes forehead jokes had real feelings behind them then

The truth is.. hobbs and show not best for fnf franchise

.  Dwayne &quot;the rock&quot; Johnson is awesome,  and has more talent than tyrese 

And vin diesel always says they are like a family...

Imagine if Luke Hobbs was actually the villain all along, he planned his arrival in Fast 5, tricked Dom and the family by joining them, then absolutely obliterate them in Fast 10. An unexpected turn of events that would get Hobbs and Dom killed.

All these &quot;the fast and furious isn&#39;t about cars anymore&quot; people don&#39;t seem to understand how film development works. You can&#39;t make multiple sequels and a spinoff if the story never changes. The movies stay successful because they are cool and promote a dedicated fan base so despite critics and gear heads crying that the franchise changed the movie wasn&#39;t made for just y&#39;all.

While ideally, this F&amp;F episode would&#39;ve made it even without Dwayne, his marketability for such action flicks is what really brought him in - not to mention the audience he&#39;s brought with him that doubled both patronage and eventually, PROFIT - which is what the producers actually wanted. My two-cents.

Man THE ROCK is sh*<b>*</b> destroyed F9

Damn Tyrese sure is in love with himself. Holyshit.

Y&#39;all beef all u want. They still gonna take ur money anyway. 

Well instead of throwing words like girls, they should meet in a ring and settle all this.

Lol this guy said the rock wasnt an action star until he was in fast and furious  what kinda critic is this

No Dwayne in f&amp;f 9. So Tyrese won.

Now I know why I hate tyrese

I feel like Tyrese fuels the fire. The both of them need to have a sit down and hash it out because it’s ridiculous at this point. Was Black Rose a good album though? Haven’t heard it yet.!

The ff forgot wat it was about real street racing modified cars NOZ Los Angels not taking over the wold exotic cars jets and mission impossible let the real 007 Handel that scenery bring back the true ff

Are these grown men.....

Hobbs and shaw may have made a lot of money but the story line was garbage.

Rock sucks yea i said it

Well the racing and modified cars shit was boring anyways didn’t bother watching any of it till it changed to something more interesting (IMO)

God it seems like there&#39;s way too much drama between actors these days

Fast and the furious is dead

In my opinion having the rock save the franchise and bring back viewers to see the movie, after paul walker died some of the other movies made flanked, the rock made it an action movie thats true but it is the directors who have the script not the actors, they just act for what they are given and played that role, they should have put more members after the rock that can focus on driving like another big star or two not just be focusing on the rock to carry the franchise, the rock didnt ask for this so if the directors dont do something about turning back the action to cars more then this franchise will not last long, having the rock making this action is good without him this franchise never been able to survive the drowning downfall so for me its better to have the rock than tyrese they can have another driver who is fresh and well known that is not a wwe star the rock is enough in my opinion.

I Rather Tyrese be in F&amp;F than Dwayne .

Fast and furious is live action anime

This dude Tyrese better chill out before he talks himself out of the franchise all together. The rock vs Tyrese.. who should we keep  its been fun Tyrese but it&#39;s just no competition

This whole &quot;feud&quot; is a work.

THE ROCK IS JUST LIKE HIS  REPUBLICAN PARTY. ALL ABOUT HIMSELF

Hobbs and shaw was garbage tho

Leave some effin popcorns for us too !!!

Hobbs &amp; Shaw was TRASH️️️️ It’s on number one because of the smarks (internet fans). I’m glad the last generation is over.

He didnt become a bonafide action star until FF ?  lmao ok Because Scorpion KingWalking TallThe RundownDoom&amp; Get Smart Are all movies that just dont exist 

I hope they can make up.
