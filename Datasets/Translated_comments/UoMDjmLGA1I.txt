Far cry 4 in nutshell

Jeez, someone died?!

He is so cute

This is funny and sad at the same time

Who&#39;s playing Jumanji?

In America, people complain about morning traffic. Meanwhile in Nepal, people get chased by Rhino on the way to work. <a href="">#livelifelikeitsyourlastday</a>

That&#39;s not even a bike, it&#39;s a scooty which is gearless and doesn&#39;t even go above 60 kmph....a rhino can easily catch it...wonder what happened to those riders.

And you complain when the dog on your street runs after your motorcycle
SHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET

See what happens when you play jumanji!

Every time I watch this video I think of Far Cry 4 because of the rhino, the rhino chasing the vehicle and the fact that it&#39;s in Nepal.

I like rhinos and all, but can you imagine how much it must stink to like in a country with them? We might complain about squirrels or deer. these guys have to worry about freaking rhinos getting in their tomato plants!!!!

Why them bitches so damn fast!

It amazing to me!!!!

Mahdi

only happen in NEPAL.

What's wrong with you guys?
Wow! Amazing!
WTF moments

How cool, and how nice he ran. What a cute animal, I would send him... and I would send him somewhere.
china

man look at the speed of the rhino. it runs as fast as the motorcycle even though it&#39;s so huge. by the way shit country nepal

That would be scary

The wording for this video is just another example of how we vilify wildlife. It did not have &#39;destruction on its mind&#39; but rather was most likely stressed and scared of being in a strange and alien environment. The death of a person is very unfortunate and highlights how more education is needed to provide people in potential encounter areas with guidelines on how to react to this situation.

Must have been playing jumanji

Lol :D

Frankie was right all along...

The bike rider was like &#39;fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu&#39;
<b>ACRE - BRASIL</b>

Putz.....
Run, rhino, run!!!!

To me it looks more like a scared and confused rhino running aimlessly.

Well...at least one road user knows what his horn is for!

It&#39;s not  Rhino entering town , it is towns entering rhino habitat.

I guarantee that woman&#39;s shouting in the background was helping the situation in absolutely zero ways
