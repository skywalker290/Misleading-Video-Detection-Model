Can we just all agree that this LWIAY intro was one of the best

Pewds doesn&#39;t even realized this video reached <b>669</b> likes

Shaved Felix looks like Johnny Sins

Alita came from mars not zalam so it’s obvious why Elon put her on a star ship

Is it just me or pewdiepie look better without hair gel

me in australia knowing you can drink at 18

I love the intro

all the comments about legal age of drinking whiskey, but let me tell you a secret, you are not gonna get much of that no matter how old are you. <b><i>*sad wage slave noises*</i></b>

<a href="">12:01</a> what vid is this one

Hahaha cringe not FLOOR gang
Me HOW DID YOU KNOW IM 9
I am drunk
Pewds: Says lords name in vain Me: Stop saying the lords name in vain

Just feeding the video more algorithm metrics.

Can we just appreciate the new intro?

But the rvb reference-

<a href="">3:52</a> Is it normal that the light behind Pewds turned by itself?

What if the whiskey parts were edited out too so late people wouldn’t know why the sub is whiskey themed

When trees die, I’m sure they release all the carbon dioxide they’ve ever absorbed. So like replanting is still good but a little less helpful.

I just thought of something.If a toy from Toy Story died the girl wouldn&#39;t know and she would just play with the toys corpse.

Pewds I know your reading this, your doing good gamer. High five bro

Has anyone noticed pewds forehead on left

<a href="">6:27</a> as a Dutchie I will tell you that every Dutch person watching felt so honored.

WOO NETHERLANDS GANG

&quot;19 year olds can&#39;t drink&quot;* Australians have entered the chat *

That rise of the PP meme was funny

I&#39;m guessing most of ur audience is American then pewds

<a href="">0:17</a>

So like- My mom was a teen mom. and both my mom and dad are 30- How can you be the same age as them, they&#39;re boring and old- Besides your birthday is 5 days away from my fathers! (29 of october 1989)

Exposed by the mirror

“Next theme is whiskey.”      Me: YALL BE DRINKIN WHILE U MAKIN VIDS? NO WONDER YOUR SO LIT!

I got a virus from chaina

hahahaha

Abstaining from alcohol made me a better person. It will make you better too, Felix. Alcohol reduces your immunity, and decreases your capacity for making informed decisions while under it&#39;s influence. You also need to be able to feel good without a crutch

<a href="">3:48</a> what a wholesome content, the genuine joy

Can someone please tell me wtf happend to terraria

Yaes. Bald pewds lol. Easy to forget you’re not 26 anymore lol. Baldness would remind us how old were all getting. Plus, I’ve been having my hair fall out since I was 17. I’m not bald, it always grows back but then a new spot comes along. It’s weird.

Merc stealth is, and will likely be, the best gaming keyboard.

Since pewds and Elon Musk are friends Pewdiepie should get in one of Elons rockets and become the first youtuber to stream from space.

I see though the lies of the jedi!

<a href="">2:58</a> Pewds: &quot;The absolute mad lad&quot;Me: &quot;NANI??!!!! DOES HE KNOW NUX TAKU??!!!&quot;

I am confused, I thought Pewds had a pretty bad stint with drinking and wasn&#39;t gonna do it anymore.

Elon Musk is a poster child just like Mark Zuckerberg.  A smart guy that can roll out new tech to the masses with a smiling face and appearance that it&#39;s a super smart idea because its Elons idea.  Its all bullshit like Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson.  THEY ARE ALL NOTHING MORE THAN ACTORS

Don’t shave your head! You could get such long hair,that you could be a pretty princess.

Seeing Pewds shake the computer and smiling gave me life

Pewdz:Jokes on you,I’m speaking Chinese Me,a Chinese:……But I can’t understand

Pewds: &quot;even 19yr olds can&#39;t drink&quot;Me living in the Pacific... <b>wheezing noises</b>

I loved when he threw back to an old meme at <a href="">12:30</a>

I&#39;m sorry I unsubscribe

PSA: ENOUGH QUOTE COMMENTS

Pews play Dreadout 2

Anyone else just get a notification from YouTube for this. Like. Right now. 4 days after post.

<a href="">13:00</a> steins gate
Highly recommend you watch Alite then pewds its a great movie. Recently watched it for the first time a month ago and then watched it the next 2 days as well, you could say i got alittle &quot;to into it&quot; i am addicted dont judge me

Why does pewds casually have whiskey on his desk?you good dad?

I love pp review
shave your hair and wear an e girl wig

I&#39;ve never disagreed more with Pewds than when he said put pickle Rick on a rocket. That would be so dissapointing if SpaceX or NASA started taking themselves that unserious. To even suggest that is sad.

i miss the old pewds who did the last of us playthrough :(

Do a PodCast But call it a PewCast

Quick,everybody in the sub Reddit,keep sending him Minecraft dungeons trailers so he plays it

the alita battle angel thing is photoshopped lol

Pewds starts YouTubing in like 2000.Pewds in 2020, &quot;I&#39;m thinking of my longevity.&quot;

He lost 1 mil subs 
Felix you are awesome and you should try bold for a meme

Play mine craft
Who actually presses the dislike button

The Girl in the first post was kinda cute like pls see this and msg me somewhere  (sekiro_outlawz on insta snap or tiktok :( )

This was made on my birthday

Are we not gonna talk about how Pewds had a bottle of Whiskey in his recording chamber?

Clickbait!
Felix, I think the joke was that one person unsubscribing would make the percentage go down a whole point 

I think Alita Battle Angel may have been one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in a while. Elon-chan be repping his brand tho

can&#39;t do pickle american warplanes have pickle rockets nowasays

Podcast would be dope

The comments are so unoriginal calling them unoriginal is unoriginal

<a href="">6:30</a> me:️ <a href="">6:34</a> me:
Why in this does PewDiePie actually look like a evil villain

The netherlands

Felix: “ha, even 19 year olds can’t drink whiskey”Me: <b>cant laugh because I’m American</b>

He saw a ninjago meme

Pweds: 9 year olds can&#39;t drinkPeople in scotland (or the entire uk, I&#39;m not sure): I&#39;ve been legally drinking since I was 5 years old

Part of me thinks that pewds is taking 2 days off every week to smash Marzia to make a baby.

I really really loved this lyric...

<a href="">0:17</a>

I don&#39;t get the The Netherlands one.. I thought it was about the allround speedskating but that happened after this video was uploaded

we did this to him, we liked the video and he shaved his head

Pewds: Not even 19 year olds drink whiskeyThe whole comment section: Makes memes about it

shave head

Loved it 10 out of 10

I like Pewds but he really doesn’t seem to appreciate us that much 

2000 swedish crowns are $211 USD

No you’re right Felix, everyone has days off from work.  do as many videos as you want  I’ll watch them

Felix: even 19 year olds can’t drink whiskey.               LAUGS IN BELGIUM

If he doesn’t decide to call it Pewdcast he’s missed a trick.

I REALLY LIKE THE NEW INTRO FOR LWIAY

your a multimillon air
9 in 2021

Pewdiepie probably has enough money to get on the starship honestly

the &quot;pp&quot; sounds like word vagina in the philippines, but because pewds is saying it, its not awkward to say it in front of 19 yr old boys anymore but then it means dick in the other country so

CasperDiePie

Japan has despised our people for genocide, forced labor, and our country, but does it make sense that the Abe administration doesn&#39;t have an apology? Bushbaby na have to get Dokdo. Dokdo was Korean territory ... And the Japanese don&#39;t know these facts So curse us and our independence fighters in South Korea during Japanese occupation found it, I was the kind assistance of their country north and south.Cracked and a hard time and this is settled with money? As the war broke out, there were many people in North Korea whose families were there.In the Abe administration..

Pewds is going to get a pewdiepie theme rocket ride someday.

felix: even nineteen year olds can’t drink whisky me: <b>is canadian</b>

Felix u dont need to say ur going on a break we know ur not anyways

<a href="">10:51</a>

Pew news?PP NEWS!

Now you are back pewdCan you get me a new phone so I can watch your videos on? 

I remember the famous scene of Star Wars. After all, Anakin could not beat the teacher. No, after all, he was a little hesitant. In fact, Anakin was stronger. If the master and the disciple fight, the disciple will win. It does not come true for young people. However, if any of the apprentices are cared for or careless, the teacher will not miss that chance. Indeed, in order to be independent from the teacher, the disciple must absolutely defeat the teacher. That is the real repayment. Anakin was sweet. So it fell to the dark side. Thank you very much. God.

Herres for all the Dutch guys

XD My favorite youtuber just spat at me and said &quot;I don&#39;t care what you think&quot; isn&#39;t he like, 30?

damn he was definitely shaking his “phone” gently

I love the fuckin new intro

Since everyone is doing this...Pewds: Ha, even 19 year olds can&#39;t drink whiskey.Me: Laughs in, it&#39;s 2020. We all turn 20 this year.Also me: Realises it doesn&#39;t make that much of a difference to the Americans.Once again, me: Proceeds to laugh anyways.

Pewds would look like jonny sins if he shaves his head bald
