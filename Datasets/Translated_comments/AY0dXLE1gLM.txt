The attitude and confidence, stands her apart 



Chopra – who was appointed a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in 2016 – likes to have mental masturbation with “selective outrage” and “double standards” by not speaking for France and India’s Muslim women, who have been facing attacks for wearing a hijab.She is a hypocrite for crying support for Iranian woman but not others

She&#39;s a queen 

These pranks of crazy radi cal Mad coala band who probably sell lenses for slavery hiding in stolen digital copy of diana spenser body with their heads attached to. They are radicals and separatists who negotiate in their heads, that is why they stole Diana Spencer digital copy of body as a host of their safety.They kidnappers who makes holes in their victims heads to leak information to robe them. They did a lot of movies where they describe their doing as Ot rassveta do zakata, Armagedon, Leon. In such movies they make their guids how to slave rich to robe. All members of their separatists talking heads band must be in jail. It is better to find who they are and send them in jail before they did more leakins holes in people to slave., ,,,,

Age makes a woman attractive  the body becomes more attractive if you are exsercising  yeah now fillers and Botox can fill the gap ... Girls looks less attractive..

Deepika&#39;s Little Black Book = Fake, lie, PR Team, Overacting, Boring....Priyanka&#39;s Little Black Book = Just Real.



Most celebrities spend more than 2 hours on makeup seat...  I mean they look great but two hours of makeup is exhausting ‍

You&#39;re Priyanka, not Priy&#39;aa&#39;nka. The least you can do is not fake your name.



“Harper’s bazaar” could you please tell me the background music name which you have played in the beginning, it’s been one year I couldn’t get the answer for it....

Can anyone please tell me the background music name in the beginning...!!!?

my favourite heroine love you Priyanka chopra very awesome looking 

She is so beautiful Priyanka n hardworking girl

Hhhhh my friend he working!

Haa ok!

Bolny kaisy lg gai ha english bolo but lahja b apny country ko mat bholo

She always has to brag this 17 year fact. In Bihar you can get any age printed on your birth certificate. WE ALL KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE.

Must be a challenge to makeup the always- freshly-post-plasticised face.

Oh she is so freaking cute  I can&#39;t handle

️️️️ ella está hermosa me encanta como su makeup y como se viste la amo ️️

There is a stain on the woman&#39;s name

English me Kay bolti ho AAP Hindu   ...ho na

nice but so wealthy &amp; in raggedy  ripped jeans?

I really wanna know her foundations shade. Any idea what she&#39;s at,  in Mac?



She can&#39;t be recognised without make up... for sure...   money can make anyone beautiful. .... The kind of make up these ppl do...not even 3% of women apply.  There is a huge difference  in comparing with her then anyone.

Fake

So so beautiful 

She is beautiful.......

I just love you parincha

She looks way different from Miss world to now wow she looked ugly back then and skinny

Ugly body shape huge back short torso lol

The hell!  for a ponytail she needs the hairstyler

nice priyanka..

She is not beautiful but . Her personality 

I like her sweet and beautiful

All wat u need is money to look beautiful

She is extremely talented and exceptional.. The way she carries herself, her accent, her style and most importantly her attitude or aura is mind boggling.. She has conducted herself and does make India proud somewhere.. I love her and she&#39;s making us even more proudLove u pigy chops

Your makeup look superb being done by them

Her voice is so sweet

Hy miss makeup artist aunt u r beautiful too i want know yr secret... 

Fed up of her miss world announcement in every single video feddd upp

I wish , i could meet priyanka chopra at least for 5 seconds but we live in different countries

Just Wow....

&quot;Confidence is the key&quot;....girlsss

Lots of money she is spending on hr fc but after doing all these things still she is looks ugly

Cute

How Money changes peoples....

She shouldn&#39;t have played with her nose

Priyanka chopra should try another hasband instead of nick ...because priyanka is queen of beauty...... indian celeburity...

who&#39;s here after her viral hair...??

She is not a natural beauty, but he is beautiful so who cares, especially since she only had a nose job and a few things done compared to Kylie who literally had a face and body transplant

How did she started her career?

I want to see her without makeup....

<a href="">6:13</a> everyone&#39;s dream walking out of a building looking amazing and someone opening the doors for you

Iwanttakeyourburmydorlingpriyankaranisarkar

Great personality

Priyanka is beatiful

Priyanka is really ugly, look at the botoxed lips. Katrina has better English and looks but still not in Hollywood.

Please share what haircare products you use? Name brand?

When you look at your picture from your past before surgeries, don&#39;t you honestly feel uncomfortable showing your fake look as beauty now? U may not like the truth I reminded, but it&#39;s sooo... crazy to say you are beautiful because u won miss world which is judged based on other factors than more beauty.

looking at your transformation, I can tell that even an ugliest looking woman can look good. There is no need for natural beauty anymore. But probably u spent most of your time thinking about gaining beauty and look young. What.....hard regular duty. Crappp....

Priyanka is very beautiful  she is princess

Gorgeous lady !!!!!an inspiration

She is beautiful but how hard is it to look great when you have a “ team”?

She knows that movie industry is not about beauty? Because she seems to put it in the same line with peagants

Bumu guzel be heryeri yapma zoraki

I LOVE how she asked if she could call her “Brown Barbie” to make sure that she wasn’t offending Priyanka.

Which mask does she used ???

Old Priyanka lady hahahaha

Priyanka is natural beauty..

She&#39;s so cool and lovable 

This is why i really loves priyanka chopra! 

She is such beautiful soul… i really like her…

Amazing video!

She&#39;s so beautiful and real.. It makes me cry 

she&#39;s so pretty

<b>Only Priyanka Chopra</b> 



Randy hai Priyanka

Lucky, talented gal

White skin is not required for exhibiting ur talents.. Its upon ur mindset nd wellpower.. pc Is the best example for it

I love this lady

Poori video me bas isk cehre ki painting hi hui hLol

Down to earth person!!

So we can never be beautiful given that they spend 2 hrs ....we cant do that right?

Her secret weapons for super glowing skin are tons of skin whitening chemical peels, skin whitening masks,skin whitening tablets and lastly skin whitening makeup.....its definitely her wish to what to put on her skin but I cant tolerate that LYING part.because she must do this for living. If she start raising this problem ALL HER OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PLUCKED AWAY.......In India heroines brides and fashion models are selected only for their paleness/whiteness...its such a NATIONAL SHAME.......if this goes on I think within ten years millions of girls will marry white men like priyanka to change their racial identity i.e. darkness....this definitely shows that INDIA IS AN UNDEVELOPED NATION...are females in USA selected to play lead roles ONLY for their blonde/tan skin?????I think definitely NO......

She actually has no good skin anymore you can see pimples and scars

that moment when u realize she did a lot in her life but only heard of her because she married Nick Jonas lol

I hate her

For good skin...we don&#39;t need to go to a beauty parlour....eat healthy......

she&#39;s not pretty

ye log to bina makeup k ghr se niklte v ne... agr hme esa makup krne ko mile to inse ache hi dikhenge hm...



She has a grl who never look back,, she goes on and on.. In her life

️️️

<a href="">1:27</a> Hell isn&#39;t cold lol ....but love ya PC

Ilove paryanak

You know I just love how she is so loved in a new country

I love how she was listening to her makeup artist like she was listening to an important lecture.

Can&#39;t believe she has to spend 2 hours to look this shitty

Artist is tooooo beautiful

I love her walking style....its killing

SA linda

Her voice

Plastic surgery

Wow very nice

Nobody is perfect but she look so natural and perfect to me, I don&#39;t have time for actresses, because of their fake appearances but to me Priyanka is the opposite of them, she still have the natural tradition culture of old times, she is the hope and direction for the new generation of young ladies.

they have created a brand Priyanka

Shes so perfect !

When u have full fledged team for skin care and makeup.. than obviously u need little little everything afterwards on ur own..  Godd these rich and famous ppl are soo delusional..

Bangs actually look good on her tho...

You look like a barbie....very pretttyyy girl in whole world...your skin colour is also beautiful...you are more prettier than white girl...Dont need to be white to be beautiful....i am not fond of white skin....i have seen a white girl and ugly tooo....

By watching this i became more and more fan of priyanka.

priyanka is so pretty , but I&#39;ve never seen her without make up. she&#39;s either having her eyebrows on, eyeliner or foundation at least.not blaming her ,but yeah she has to keep some sort of transparency :)



Indians

Love to see the Make up artist &amp; PC have such great working relationship, and love how the Make up artist is passionate about working on PC and loving her job! Nice to see the Positive vibes. PC is definitely one of my fav persons &lt;3

No, it&#39;s not okay that you called her brown Barbie.

Most beautiful girl

Magic of makeup without makeup you know how she looks.

She’s much much much prettier in this video than in the “famous” picture which she took with Nick Jonas in a golden dress. I was thinking “isn’t she a little old for Jonas”...Sorry! She’s so beautiful and energetic! Now I even start to feel she deserves someone better than Jonas...

I&#39;m shook by her beauty 

All about density in the film industry lot heroines are more beautiful then you and  good actress but where they live they are not forgetting their country  and not after money  they wanted to be Indian because their mother and father are Indian

incredible features??? THAT NOSE IS FAKE AS HELL!!!  and the area where her nose begins - !!!yuck

her nose sucks

Most active women in the world , i like u so much

Lovely smarty priyanka

I love  you priyanka

Her grandmother rejected Jesus and became a hindu for political ambitions. her mother is a staunch hindu. The girl herself always tom toms hinduism in her comments and insults Jesus every chance she gets. Now she made a &quot;bakra&quot; of lil boy nick and his father so they chanted hindu mantras and bowed before hindu idols.

I see no nose job,  she hasn&#39;t had any plastic

She was beautiful earlier but plastic surgery made her ugly

makeup dresses....what a life...is this life? 

Does anyone have any idea what shade lipstick she&#39;s wearing?

Hi

HER VOICE.. JUST WOW 

I love seeing this, Priyanka is so very beautiful but she has such kind heart. I have been a fan of hers and to see all her work outside of Hollywood is AMAZING!! I am also fond of Patti and follow her. Thank you for featuring her 

You are beautiful 

you speak very well

Watch and learn from the Miss world watch

BROWN WOMEN ARE DEFINITELY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ON THE PLANET. THEY HAVE THE TAN SKIN THAT WHITE WOMEN PAY FOR AND THE STRAIGHT HAIR BLACK WOMEN WANT. I LOVE MY PEOPLE !!!

Nice mother and daughter relationship.

I would love to see Angelina Jolie... black book..  the hair dresser(man) and make up man are so dedicated and caring. ..

Confidence, intelligence and strength ( in and out).

️️️

Itne log makeup krte hain toh khubsurt dikna kya mtlb

Okayyyy I need episode 4 now

I was just thinking about the rules to makeup .... when anyone says you don’t want to do this or you should do that....?...,...the only person that sets the standards for how your face should present is you. Has anyone ever just thought about why is applying makeup this way considered law and this way wrong... the point is, enough of the social standards. It was bad enough in grade school, then high school and continues as adults. Why does everyone have to apply makeup in this particular manner or its categorized as “you don’t want to do that”... oh well maybe I do.. I guess what I am trying to say is there are so many rules in life we have to abide by, can we not have rules we have to follow with makeup  and it be just fine

Her nose and mouth not attractive

She&#39;s very average loking without makeup. She looks different now, she was way prettier long time ago

She is so much beautiful. Priyanka we love you

PeeCee, you&#39;re amazing. <a href="">#LoveAndHugs</a>

She’s just hard to watch because she is so stupid.

really,looking at Priyanka makes me happy and confident

love her the way she is



Nice

So much or little bit 

U r my favourite i love ur style

Her accent n voice

Overacting, she wants to pronounce words as if English is her mother tongue. Bookish

She needs to stop doing her own eye brows. They don&#39;t look good, she is over filling them. Ladies One size does not fit all.

Hate her so much

Lots of love for u PCFrm nepal.

Wow with makeup and without makeup you look beautiful love you priyanka

Exactly the same. My mom used to oil my hair so much and sometimes my aunt so I didn&#39;t have a dry as scalp. Then I would do my nanis hair. I feel like every Indian girl went through this

Her hair is gorgeous

wow she&#39;s gorgeous!

What eye shawdow is that?

She is sooooooooo beautiful. Also a good actress

hey could anyone tell me what shadow pallet is at <a href="">2:21</a>?

What happened to her nose!

She looks a little like Selena Gomez

who else thinks the next black book season should have lupita nyongo&#39;o. Harpers bazaar pleaaseeee make it happen

She looks gorgeous 

Very nice

77

I LOOOOOVE THIS WOMAN

Legal!

Awww she&#39;s so sweet

I love you mille bisous from France 

I&#39;m y begist fan pk love you soo much

She is so interesting ...I always watch her videos when bored.... And it boosts me... Love PC

I like u so much

oh she&#39;s not so beautiful...

My love my girl Priyanka Chopra &lt;3

Wow she&#39;s gorgeous

Can anyone tell me the highlighter palette she was using at the end of the video?

I was waiting for a hair mask

Pause at <a href="">0:22</a> , there is an obvious ring indent on her left ring finger... 

Can anyone tell what lip shade she is wearing in grey shirt

Love her !!

i love her so much. so natural

She is so full of herself. And trying desperately to be &#39;an american&#39;

Priyanka ,your nose looks bit different than before ,am I right? I’m pretty sure you have done your nose job .

Face pr itni lipai aur putai k baad to koi bhi sundar lag skta hai

Down. To. Earth. Beauty.

Gorgeous P C ️

she spends 2 hours for everyday basis?

I love p.c

Her eyebrows are amazing.

what is the face mask she said ? which brand

Which Lipstick??️

bella!

the bangs suits you

<a href="">1:27</a> makes me laugh when she said cold as hell&#39;&#39;&#39;  first time i heard hell has winter times hahhaahaba

Woohoooo waiting for this one since ages

Can the stylist fix her brows? They make her look too manly these days. Her american tv debut brows were best.



Gorgeous girl she is ♡

Would love to see more of Patti Dubroff.  So knowledgeable.

I would like to try this mask.

Love her from the Miss World until now

Bangs look the best on her, side part, long hair makes her look so exotic . She has thick hair grow it long! Revive the iconic priyanka from the Indian film days!!! She had amazing makeup artist at that time. The problem with working with a glam team you have to tell them what you like and not get to many inputs from them. Everyone from hair stylist to makeup artist will try to do there twist on you. You almost feel compelled to go with there ideas. I like how priyanka looked in her Indian films , the type of style she had and makeup that was done on her!

She is a Diva no doubt

SHE IS the beauty queen......she is extremely talented and magnificent.......love her so much

KWEEEEEEEENNNNN

I would have loved a devoted talk on her lipcare and lipcolors that she uses. Since, she always highlights her lips, a very important aspect that was completely missed.

Amazing lady.....

I have no word to tell something about you you are amezing love you lot

Love you PC you are my inspiration

Ugh! I like her! Beauty inside and out,seemingly.

She&#39;s a naturel beaty

The way she gets out of the car

She is so lovely and simple

i hate her nose. surgery fail

Average looking woman, her thick bushy eyebrows make her look like a man.  A woman should not have thick eyebrows like man..Thicker eyebrows make you look older and manly looking.

i think she would look AMAZING with bangs, she has such flattering features that would 100% let it enhance her beauty

<a href="">2:55</a> was so cringey lol

She is such a sweetheart! No arrogance, so down to earth! And her eyes! She has killing eyes ️

Queen

Ohhh I just love u so much that would not me able to mention in the small section of comment box. I really admire u dear PC hope I will meet u someday

I like u a lot priyanka ,I also wanna be a great and multitalented women like u 

 ️

I just love you sooo much Priyanka. You are beauty with confidence and intelligence

She’s really talented

Your super beautiful 

Doesn’t she look like saleena Gomez

Her hair in Dostana is my favourite!!!!

i love her style .. very chic, simple but glam .. 

I love these priyanka series

Priyanka is super gorgeous 

Brown Barbie

She makes everything beautiful when she wear it

2ghante makeup ke baad bhi esy nazer arhe hai  toba ...i think u need more surgries ...

No actress tells her beauty secrets<a href="">#priyanka</a> is such a darling..!!

her face does not need much make up at all. just look how gorgeous she looks at <a href="">4:50</a>  &amp; <a href="">6:12</a>  ️

Love her she is so beautiful natural and inspirational

She is amazing

Shes so pretty!!!

Man her success makes me so happy. OMG i love her so much we share the same zodiac sign too omg i love her and im soooo proud of her!! You go girl!!

Nice videoooo

she entered Beauty Pagents  at the age of 18. Get your facts right. If she was 17, she would be considered under age and would not be able to particiapte.

She look so pretty

waaoooo...........

Priyanka I am Sri Lankan u are my favourite actress and u are very beautiful. 

She walks on road without cops and guard.....in America but what will happen when she will try to do this in India...don&#39;t try this in India

“I’ve been in beauty pageants ...” she was Miss World

Why is she so beautiful??

love u so much mam

I love your hair bangs priyanka bring them back

love these series

Such a breather this girl is on earth ....I never knew I would also be fan of some one like this...

Nice hair

She looks like Marcedes carera.

Please share how you conceal your under eyes you look great and Indian women are known to have the darkest blackest under eyes it&#39;s hereditary

Her accent, her style 

I love Priyanka 

thanks a lot priyanka, i have really admired you and your beauty since childhood &lt;3

Priyanka is super pretty

Naturally beautiful

When you meet success, lots of jealous dogs will be barking underneath your feet.

Priyanka Chopra is stunning. She actually looks like a Barbie doll. ️

I dont get why she is so famous in the wset...?! Other then her show quantico

This made my day

Priyanka&#39;s nose looks like a plastic surgery disasterWhy did u do that to urself peeceeWe love u

Is she Priyanka’s personal makeup artist?

she is awesome anyone who can walk that fast wit heels man...

You need all these people to make you look so plain. Im sorry but they do not do a great job. U hardly look glam. Y looked beautiful in bollywood

Less background Music.

Wow

Love it

It would be nice to get some product details like the name of her shampoo and conditioner!

Brown Barbie she&#39;s so cute mashuallah

️️

Tbh nobody would have been ever wore alot of make-up if anyone had a good skin..without scars.. I&#39;m telling you this coz I really wish to have such skin.. but I have acne scars all over my face and this is the reason why I wear makeup . (Sorry for bad english)..

I love her so much!!! So real and beautiful

nice yaar

I love oiling my hair too with coconut oil and I also agree that it might be the best remedy for the hair

I LOVE HER 

She is so overrated, don’t like her at all, so cocky...

Priyanka is literally the only actress i look up to because she&#39;s so real (doesn&#39;t just act real but genuinely is) and i love how she makes it so easy for us to relate to her! She&#39;s pure love!

I LOVE THIS !!!!

Do this series with Olivia Palermo too please!

she glows from every pore of her body!!

حتى لو جبت كل مايكب ارتست راح تبقي قبيحة وبشعة وهندية لا تحاولي تباني امريكية مع لكنة

Can any one tell about the skin care products mask , cream that&#39;s Priyanka artist use ????

Beauty, money, fame... Nothing matters but her confidence n the personality she&#39;s evolving into is incredible 

Am I the only one who thinks Priyanka is not that attractive?

Shaw how you look withaut makap

Which mask is it?

So you are ugly until you have money.

Priyanka is so beautiful!I’d love to see Ashley Graham next!

Can you please do a tutorial on your everyday makeup? ️

I want this little black book

Why does everything thing with Priyanka Chopra get like a million views in a day

Why wear make up? I dont get it

Does anyone know the lipstick she is wearing at <a href="">2:35</a>?

Am the huge fan of PC 

How tf does priyanka get her hair to be so bouncy and voluminous?? SPILL THE TEA

She’s so confident and amazing

Woow Priyanka this is amazing really I like it and I like Harper Bazaar too it’s so awesome I’ll like to go one dayif god welling️

Big fan......love u pc

I love the series with PC! please do atleast 10 more episodes ️

my queen, i love her so much

️️️

It&#39;s bazaaaar. You don&#39;t have to act like a diva and say bizare.

Lovely priyanka 

at <a href="">5:06</a> she said &quot;anti-gravity&quot; n she pronounced it as &quot;antaaaiii gravity&quot;. Is ds the correct pronunciation of the word &quot;anti&quot;???? I am just asking for knowldge

Yay! Team Priyanka!

Ilysm

She is so confident and that makes her lovely

What’s wrong with her nose?

She is so beautiful gosh.

She can say brown Barbie around her but not anywhere else. Why she would allow her to is beyond me.

She’s beautiful and I’m happy she’s darker skinned. Bc in India they have colorism issues.

ek makeup ka kharcha lakho rupees ...fake people ..saala gaav ki ladkiya Jada good looking hoti Hai isse

is this the last video?

i love u priyanka.. i am a big fan of yours.. plzz tell me your base product name..

Omg Wow, I love this!, Priyanka Chopra fan, yah Indian hair oiling as a child is inherent but makes a big difference, I see the difference in my hair

<a href="">1:45</a>
