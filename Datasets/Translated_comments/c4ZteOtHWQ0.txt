Alia deserved a national award for this

This song gives motivation to be strong even if u have no one to tell problems ,share pain those restless nights nd mind full of thoughts nd no one to hear ...

Modi ji. Who says that a Muslim does not risk his life for Hindustan... By spreading hatred among Hindu Muslims in the country, our country will be protected by Hindu Muslims who say that this country does not need leaders like you...

Spotify removes this song 😡

What is this appealing tone in Indian music?
I&#39;M A TURKISH. I&#39;M ASKING BECAUSE I&#39;M REALLY CURIOUS. IS THIS TRUE? DID INDIA REALLY WIN THE 1971 WAR WITH THE INFORMATION GIVEN BY AGENT NAMED RAAZI?

Don't say uppsc exam is paid only for /Razii/ hey🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
We love India and I am really proud i am indan

This songs is so good for students who are preparing for exams....

I don&#39;t like alia bhatt too much but I am big fan of her acting , excellent acting just like kajol &amp; madhuri ,she made hit single-handedly by her superb acting ,she deserves national award &amp; also Arijit da deserves national award for his soulful voice

<a href="">

What is the name of the movie?
The I.B. officer deserves an award also

This song conveys a true message; If we are determined to achieve something and our heart is extremely stubborn to get it 😖, mission impossible will indeed be successful 🏆

&quot;Lagan me jaan jaaye wahi tho sarihadh hai&quot;My favourite sentence in the song

one of best movie of Alia Bhatt❤️👍

Why did the groom die?
I feel for the real her though. All soldiers have the hope of coming back to their families. Her family became her battle ground.

Alia is the best actor in the entire hindi industry, you can&#39;t disagree

best movie in all of bollywood

Everytime first ever chance to do something great was given to women becz men were not apt for that... And every time women have proved they are worth it..... Thus, all women need is a chance... 🤐💗

Sir Amoni hoa ok 👍👍👍😊
In whole life only one role where she proves ryt

As for me, I see him sitting in the rain all day long, please let him stay until the 90th minute.
I am not afraid of danger. I surrendered my soul five years ago
Don't marry me, just protect me. I am a Muslim, a martyr for the world, because my dear citizen, get ready. Very soon the Hour will come
Five years here, a people outside, you know, my dear citizen, Atay, may bring you out, dreams in a dream that kill you, danger, martyr, reciting the Qur’an.
They punished me in Bozambique outside, right, we will be held accountable, I will see an avenger, an avenger, a people who saw here, all of them who saw them here.
Change, I don't want to change. I am a man. Death. Death. Loneliness. Receiver of the Qur'an. Love me, martyr. I love my dream and martyrdom. Dear citizen. Attay is a martyr of the world.
See date
Dear citizen of Atay, the last world war occurred, the third world war
Oh God, accept my Qur’an and make it an ongoing charity for my deceased and make her one of the people of Paradise. O Lord, dear citizen of Atay, I am the last sign of the hour and a martyr. You are consummating your plans for me to enter into them for a long time without a blanket. May your soul rest in you. I will see you in suits.

One of the best song ❤️

I can&#39;t understand what she write in the last on the note

Super movie..
Beautiful , breathtaking, bomb

She was a very brave person and her sacrifices meant a lot, but let&#39;s just say Indian movies glorify war too much, that too in a way that most of us are kind of forced to feel patriotic, I don&#39;t mean to offend or hurt anyone&#39;s sentiments but it&#39;s a fact that these movies make a lot more than they should cause we usually ignore if they are morally correct or not.

Why did she keep the baby if she didn&#39;t love her husband? She was a horrible person.

She was a great Daughter, Warrior, and Citizen.But let’s just accept that she was a terrible Human.

Can you send any link of Raazi full movie?
People don&#39;t talk enough about the amazing outfits

Brave!! MERI BHARAT KI BETI.

Make a Dostiwala movie in our country, instead of hating India, daughters have not been sent as raw agents, Pakistan is married to the movie, we have also sent gay daughters with the pill of hatred.
THe <a href="">1:38</a> scence was amazing,,

Amazing actor ahalawat sir

I m proud to b a girl

A fabulous film but I didn&#39;t like the music much. Only the title track was an exception, I loved it. The song illustrates how much more effort you&#39;re willing to give, only if you&#39;ve agreed to do the job from the bottom of your heart. I really liked the scene <a href="">1:38</a> ; very embarrassing for the person but funny when the others see it. <a href="">#there</a> never was any line between Muslims ans Hindus, never will be

After Raazi, if Alia Bhatt's film looks good in comedy, that film is 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania'. The rest is all air.
She deserves prizes because she is doing very well.

100 time seeing this video

She sacrificed her life, death ,love, and much more outside of our thinking....she was a hidden crystal.....real warrior her secrecy of life and death deserve a salute 🇮🇳🇮🇳..... On 73rd republic day let&#39;s remember...many agents like her who live hidden for INDIA whose everyday is a war......

1 like for all those RAW agents who sacrifice their life and stay in other countries so that we can sleep peacefully👍🏽. Jai Hind🇮🇳 Jai Bharat🇮🇳 Vande Mataram🇮🇳 Jai Jawan🇮🇳

Jaydeep Ahalwat&#39;s acting ❤️

pakistan has crush on india 😂

Arijit singh
Heart is happy ♥️ 😊
No doubt alia is best actresss❤️love from pakistan❤️

Well I think she may not be good in knowledge about India, but I can&#39;t deny the fact that she is a very good actress,she works hard but doesn&#39;t show off much about that  and she can do any kind of role and she fits very well in all roles

Sehmat is the best answer to all those who think &quot;Muslims are terrorists&quot;

listening now to this masterpiece

Arijit Singh ❤️
Just forget about Alia&#39;s acting and think about the original lady who risk her own life for our nation. Repect.

Very nice song

<a href="">You would not have seen such a video of a mother.

Alia Bhatt ➡️
No one is talking about excellent act by Jaideep Ahlawat....

I am not interested to write my diary but I think it&#39;s really amazing because imagination is really bad habit when you imagine something then you want to eat something when you see the food.. And you feel disgust when you see any dirty things... That&#39;s all my story 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏I am not interested to watch any marriage, janau and muran,, also because I can&#39;t see the moment where any child starts to cry 😭😭I am cool and dacing person since childhood 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰I like to dance, singing, running, to watch natural thing like trees 🌲🌳🌴, jungle, birds, butterfly🦋🦋 to visit   natural place😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I am attitude breakers who has bad nature..... I don&#39;t like to make any people fool😎😎and I also don&#39;t like when any people insults the artist....... I don&#39;t like when anybody talk with me the cheap word .... I love my self......... 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍imagination is really bad because when I see something then it&#39;s definitely come in my dreams 🤭🤭😍😍🥰🥰some time it&#39;s good and some time it&#39;s bad👎👎😂😂

Kisi ko dukh hai ki Bhagwaan sb kuch dekh rha hai aur kisi ko usi me khushi hai ki bhagwaan dekh rha hai.... I always believe in my God because he is only in this world who knows my self100%

I like to break fake attitude because this is bad for all people who has fake attitude.. Fake attitude means negative and bad attitude.. Because if someone hurt me then I am also interested in to make them fool.. And who is he😂😂😂😂😂if anyone hurt you then teach that person with their own style... Not to impress anyone but for you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I don&#39;t care about that people what think about me but myself and my god 😎😎😎😎😎and I am 100% right that&#39;s well known.... 😎😎😎😎😎😎it&#39;s all my case 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Alia ❤️❤️
Satisfied.....❤️
It is crazy how she developed her acting skills from her first film

Thanq so much for my guruji🙏 I think it is useful for something good 🙏ur sincere student 🙏pray for something good.... be positive

Alia was best in this movie .

Wherever I go, that's the limit....🔥🔥🔥

Alia acting super👌👌👌 thanks to whole Raazi team for giving such a great movie🙏🙏🙏🙏

Best performance of Alia so far! I love this song &amp; its heart-touching wordings.... but.... I DETEST THE CONCEPT OF IT!I AM ANTI-WAR OF ALL TYPES! I HATE SOLDIERS OF ALL COUNTRIES!

When her sir put hand from back to check her on here shoulder at that time  behind alia that person must be thinking that thank god I  was not there 🤣🤣

I heard this song many times but every time when I was listening then it gives new energy .I love this song 💖

One like for Gulzar ji who wrote this masterpiece song. 👌👌💖💖😊😊
Raazi is the best song

Sehmat Khan I want to become like you

<a href="">1:39</a>

This film is absolutely fractured..... Pls don&#39;t watch it🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Read the book. It&#39;s where real Sehmat is shown..... The book name is &quot;Calling Sehmat&quot; for those who don&#39;t know written by Harinder Sikka

Wowww,what a song what a beauty

Alia deserved a National award for her performance

Where should the heart go...❤️ What I had is immense... May life come in love.... that is the limit...!!
Arijit Singh❤️❤️❤️
Proud to be an Indian and a soul of this mother land. 🙏

Just here for ARIJIT SINGH ❤️❤️
Arijit Singh ❤️
Shankar ehsan loy + arijit singh = 🔥
I can&#39;t even imagine how she feel 😭😢😢

Saddest thing is that the same people who praised her a year ago are now trolling her for being a bad actress. Is she kangana Ranaut level? No. But is sge a very good actress? Definately. We just need to scroll a bit down in her every movie scene and trailers to realize how much peoples opinion about her same acting has changed.

Proud to an Indian I have given my heart to my heart if my heart rules my country 🇮🇳
Everyone is talking about alia but what for sehmat Khan

She is better than gullyboy

We all criticise nepotism but this time let’s appreciate Alia Bhatt’s acting in this film.

Drive by looking at the air ❤️
If your heart is happy ❤️❤️❤️

Only for Arijit sir  💓Not for 10 th fail 😂😂

She deserves award for this movie

Is it movie???

Nice

Although she comes from a Bollywood oriented family... But still her acting is on point she deserves more than this .....and actually not all  nepokids stars are bad there are few gems who are really very good so don&#39;t ignore this point also

Wait &amp;see .first we need peace !

A fake story

Salute to samhat khan

Arijit Singh is king of music

Alia mam deserve&#39;s a Filmfare award for Raazi she did a fantastic job in this movie,I wish Alia mam good luck, never look back in your life, and I wish you that your married life will be the best married life in the whole Bollywood ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I don’t know why people slam Alia for being star kid but I really like her acting more than many other actors and star kid

Alia proved herself in Raazi and Sonam proved herself in Neerja. Enough said-

I laugh at this &#39;crush india&#39; written everywhere 🤣 soo fictionall  there  is no such thing written in any thing .

Haters- Alia can&#39;t actMe- watch highway , raazi , udta punjab, gully boy , 2 states, Badrinath ki dhulaniya, dear zindagi, kapoor and sons

“Sehmat came back to India to a royal red carpet welcome, saluted the tricolour while the military band played the National Anthem. Meghna removed the scene and instead brought her back in a depressed state, as if to show that a Kashmiri Muslim woman had done a mistake in fighting for her watan, India.”

Thnkuhh trending now****<a href="">#syali</a>💞

My life is going towards the limit💔
Alia maam all-rounder.... 👌🙏
<a href="">0:33</a> goosebumps!

God aliaa🔥🔥 what an amazing actress she is I just love her everything waiting for gangubai kathaiwadi

Motivational ❤️❤️❤️
❤This movie👌

Ye song motivate kerta hai india ke liye kuchh karne ka or mujhe IAS banne ke liye, I really love this song

She deserves all the awards she got ❤️She is the great actress 🔥

One of the best performance of Alia Bhatt&#39;s carrier in this movie. I love sehmat character. What a masterpiece. From this movie I fall in love with her.and the music is also too good.

Alia has done a great job in this movie !!

This is the best Alia Bhatt movie for me after dear zindagi

We come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.

Walking after looking at the sky, leaving no stone unturned, I don't want to burn myself in the fire...the wound is still fresh, the heart is fresh on the day, if the heart is happy, then I can agree with you, such a brave girl, Aliya did it very well, keep inspiring us. ✌
I love alia

My favorite movie ❤️
Lovely Song

Raazi is amazing movie ❤❤. I want to watch another movie like this. Aalia&#39;s acting was awesome ❤

Nah....the heart is not happy.
Alia Bhatt mind blowing all movie roll very Very talented girl and my favourite actor 👍

If she was not a nepotism product, Indian people would have actually seen her worth, who are right now blinded by hate

Hands down Alia Bhatt is the best actress in the inddustry today!

Best Alia best ✨✨🤪
I am an Algerian I love Pakistan Not only we are Muslims But because of some Indian movies He seeks to distort Pakistan  reputation ❤🇵🇰🇩🇿

Salute to sehmat khan

Alia deserved national award for this movie 🔥

You can't eat these movies.. In real life, you have fallen prey to the pigeons of Pakistan🤣🤣
send me the link of the movie
Salute to Sehamat Khan

Why do we make actor and actresses our hero just because they do such roles they are just actors they haven&#39;t done that in reality

SSR😭😭😭😭
Where we can watch this movies coz it&#39;s not uploaded on YouTube!

<a href="">

I even want  to be like her and every Indian should be like her

Pliz upload raazi full movie
It’s such an Indian thing to hate someone just because of her marks. I mean she is an actress and she does a good job with it why people comparing her marks.

Who r the unlikers 🤨🧐Btw ... I love my INDIA 😍🥰😘🇮🇳Great work by Alia Bhatt ❤️❤️😘
nepokids ho ya normal kids acting bhi kuch hoti hai jo alia bhatt ne is movie me khafi achi ki ... pls stop being hypocritic and think from ur own mind bas aag ki bhasad na bhadao...

Are there no Malayalis?
Don&#39;t forget this movie has dharma hand the movie is best bcoz of story I would be better even Radhika Apte would have done it

Leave National award aside, even if she wins an Oscar for this performance and udta Punjab - It will also be short of what she deserves. 🙌🙏

<b>This, this THIS 👆 actress right here gets an award</b>Our hypocritical audience : Undeserving, nepotistic, starkid, hate hate, HATE. 😞😞

I once wrote somewhere, &quot;I think national awards are also nepotistic. Many brilliant performances deserved it but didn&#39;t get.&quot; , This is what I meant...

Nice

Awesome song hain

Who says kadhmiri Muslim can be patriotic,  take example of sehmat khan

Arijit always sings awesome

What is the name of the movie?
Actually we know that she is NepoKid. But somehow we can feel it that she deserves to win Awards for such acting skills. (Not other Nepokids😒)

oh innocent bird come home
Everything was wrong about this movie. Kind of fake secularism was added. If want to know kindly read the book written by harinder sikka sir.

Bs movies tk hi india ki oqaat h
Salute to sehmat khan ❤️❤️Alia Bhatt ki acting really bohot achchi h and we can&#39;t deny this fact ❤️❤️ be it raazi, dear zindagi etc, her acting is ❤️❤️

Great

Nepotism starts where a children of human becomes human only not any other animal !!But it depends upon the person if he/she becomes a human or beast... No problem in nepotism,we just need talent and Alia Bhatt has always proved herself talented.. Respect the word talent not selfmade ! 😊

<a href="">1:37</a>

It&#39;s hard to believe that there are a lot of people like sehmat doing selfless service for our nation and gone unnoticed for their achievements. While they&#39;re keeping our country safe by staying in danger we&#39;re here making new problems daily in the name of religions, the first one who is a real patriot and the second one who act like they&#39;re.They know that sometimes they will be disowned by their own country still they don&#39;t give up<b>Salute</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b>

People shouldn&#39;t blindsidedly blame Alia I agree I didnt enjoy her acting in some movies but raazi brought out her acting capacities

Hats off to such daughter who left everything just his father asked her to

I read the original book calling sehmat it&#39;s awesome go and read it highly recommend.

Really a trainer makes every impossible dreams come true.🍫🍫💐

Razzi is great in this song

I loved the song

Look at the sky and walk on the soil, keep your feet on the ground, keep going forward and follow your own path.

This is seriously the best song ever

We don’t watch movies all the time. And the plot is complex. So we read. Winners of the <a href="">#UglyTruth</a>

Her only mistake is that she belongs to bhatt family which made her arrogant and selfish but overall acting in this movie was quite adorable

I like when she does hard work 😯😀

Good combination of trainer and trainee👏👏👏

Best song ever

There are no bad actors. There are bad performances. And in this movie, Alia and Vicky nailed it.

If annoying pandey can win Filmfare and dumb Kapoor a national award then alia surely disserve one award for this movie and udta punjab.

Alia is a good actress. I won&#39;t say she is the best. But at least better than druggy padukone.

Not everybody has the typical &quot;Shanaya&quot; life,There are also people who become <b>Sehmat</b> , moulded by pure circumstances! :(Deep, ain&#39;t that?

My heart and mind is ready

Alia Bhatt acting 🙏❤️ best actor in world

India itself has told that they are unable to do so by spying.
I love these kind of trainers.Really wish to have one.

East or west Alia Bhatt is the best 😁😊☺️☺️😊☺️
This girl will take indian cinema to another phase with her choice and acting.

Nice  song  and movie

See guys...we all love  SSR... but this really doesn&#39;t mean that we will disrespect a star kid... and here I&#39;m not trying to promote them and nepotism...but instead I&#39;m trying to say that respect the talent doesn&#39;t matter who that person is....a Star kid or an outsider ~Samiksha Tripathi 🙏🕉️

Boycott alia bhat

Mrunal thakur is better in raazi

Nice movie

People can&#39;t understand that Kangana used SSR &#39;s death for her personal gain.Isse kehte hai kisi aur ke kande (shoulder) pe banduk (gun) rakhe goli chalana Cheap Kangana....

Will boycott every movie of Alia except RRR.Guys do support RRR. Then only we can destroy Bollywood mafia. Am I right.

NICE

Ghatya movie

My Favourit Movei 🤗👌
I respect SSR.But blaming someone who has nothing to do with it is not right.

People fight is not on talented actresses or actors.but against nepotism.talented artist like SSR,john arbham etc faced many problems.think if we are in their places we would suffer with same problem.nepo guys should know people  are powerful not they.they are ruling.we should stop them.they should be down to earth,they should treat non nepos equally.non nepos should get offers.

Bhala hi alia Bhatt AK nepotism ke product hai but we can not blame her acting skills one of the talented girl of bollywood

Yes, you want to sacrifice yourself for your country but in this movie you have killed your family, this is the snake of Asteen, anyway hate from Pakistan, make a peaceful movie, make a movie of friendship, it will be better.
<a href="">

 dedicated to brave soldiers

We love you Alia♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️Let the people bark. It&#39;s what they can do best. Hearts full of hatred and jealousy. Your are the most talented actress, your are so hard working. What you have achieved in just a few years this haters won&#39;t achieve their whole lives. We will watch all of your movies and we will always support you💪💪💪

Alia Bhatt is one of my best female favourite actress. She acts well in every film.she is very very cute and pretty.tq.

Sup😍😘
Alia is very talented

I support talent, whether it be star kid or nepotism product (Although most of the nepo kids are useless). I think only some actors like vicky kaushal and alia bhatt is suitable for bollywood as a product of nepotism.

Movie story is good but alia bhatt is so dumb....

If people don&#39;t like or support nepotism, they should not support reservation too. The so called &quot;upper class&quot; often lose opportunities inspite of abundant talent just because of reservation. No one rises this issue though. If you feel nepotism is wrong , then reservation is wrong too. Reservation can be there but it should not comprise the talent of others.

If Kangana were to act better than Alia, she would be a star kid sun lo.
People saying now after two years that they are watching this movie ONLY for Vicky Kaushal because he is a self made actor,and they love him, have really ZERO knowledge of bollywood.Just like Alia he is also the son of a director. He is son of action movies director Sham Kaushal.That means he is also a star kid like Alia. Now you all will start hating on him too right?You people are just disgusting HYPOCRITES

Alia batt is perfect for this movie because she is hard worker

Now I hate these star kids

Haathiram rocks....
Kangna Ranaut should be cast this filmWho else think this is gonna perfect for Bollywood Queen <a href="">#Kangana</a>

Im here one and only for .... ARIJIT SINGH

Serioulsy guys you need to grow up. After liking this movie and Alia for years, you all suddenly start hating her in name of nepotism? And comment it just to get likes. Like seriously? She is one of the finest actors. oh you must be those aginst nepo kids right? fight against nepo kids were fight against those who su*ks at acting like jhanvi kapoor, arjun kapoor, sonam kapoor, the struggler annanya pandey , sooraj pancholi, athiya shetty and more. Not against the ones who are good at acting like Alia bhatt, shraddha kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Sunny Deol and more.You may hate her father, but her father&#39;s deeds don&#39;t define her. Yes, it&#39;s right she entered this industry on name of her father by karan johar, that was nepotism. But now where she is, is all because of her hardwork. She is really good at acting. And bollywood is about acting.

Alia is not  suitable for this movie or scene.

Hats off to all this daughters

People are just trolling Alia because she is the daughter of Mahesh Bhatt.She has proven her acting skills through many movies

she is  my   favourite  actress   and  she  will remain my favourite actress after nepotism

pls upload razi full movie

Hard girl

Alia is best actress ♥️She is awesome with talent &amp; beauty💖💖

Brother, please upload Razzi movie also sometime.
Alia Ma&#39;am is my favourite actress and she will always stay in my heart and she is not responsible for SSR case ok

We love our country and always we will love our country but we will never love alia and her films....If anybody else agrees with me so please comment....

I don&#39;t like Alia Bhat she didn&#39;t how much struggle an actor had to do when he don&#39;t have God father. stupid and illiterate girl even she don&#39;t know about Indian culture too..

Super yaar training is osume

Very supportive daughter. Perfect daughter 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😘😘
People really need to stop blaming Alia and nepotism for Sushant&#39;s death.  Nepotism is everywhere, get over it.  People didn&#39;t appreciate Sushant before, and now everyone is singing his praises?!  Ultimately, it&#39;s talent that thrives.  Why do you think people loved Alia and Shraddha, but hated Sonam and Ananya?  Because Alia and Shraddha can act, unlike the other two.  I mean, do people think if they dislike Sadak 2 and make it a flop, it&#39;ll get Sushant justice, because it won&#39;t.  The CBI inquiry will.  So stop hating on Alia guys!

i liked this video earlier, i came back just to dislike it, the hate is real and these nepo kids will now suffer.

die soon deslike for alia

Stop making assumptions and commenting we are only one who view this and make popular it doesn&#39;t matter we watch for commenting false but we watch and so views are increased we are the only who takes subs and watch nepo stars movie we are the one who support them like on social medias and most importantly we are the one who watch there trailers and movie..... Can&#39;t we stop watching we could have ssr before he would be more popular and could face all that but we did neptosim and supported nepo stars and now I could see many comments that are veyyyy false so why are you doing now and increasing view <a href="">#itsaremistakealsodontblameactorsonlyweareoneofthenepos</a>.Who agree with me and want justice for SSR you should take this comment bigger and boycott this let&#39;s stop watching thank you I am 14yrs I will come after I week to see how many of you changed by letting this liking to Justice till then lay on bed and have some Dil Bechara.....😥😥😥😥😃😃😃Stil 13 ikes don&#39;t you all want to change and agree I think u all don&#39;t want to give justice to our lovely SSR I just watched Dil Bechara know it was too good u just nly like to ....I don&#39;t want to say but ya whosoever reading this u Should like this so that this cmnt others could read and <a href="">#boycott</a>

Nepotism won&#39;t be changed i dnt know why such movies are given to such dum and nepotism products

I hate Alia Bhatt
i hate alia
Imao. Did you seen how irritating Alia is. .  Alia is a nepotism product as well but you guys  will respect her cause you are her fan and now she is well established in the industry. But don&#39;t forget how many chances Karan Johar gave her like she is his daughter SOTYHumpty Sharma ki dulhania Kapoor and Sons2 States ( Karan Johar as Producer ) Shaandar ( Dharma Productions) Dear Zindagi ( Karan Johar asProducer )Raazi ( Karan Johar and Hiroo Johar asProducers )And none less than Kalank ( Karan as Producer ). He gave so much limelight to Alia and if you saw Kalank, he cut so many scenes of Madhuri Dixit and gave those to Alia. He made Alia the centre of attention in the film. Apart from that he also gave Alia some cameos in his films like in Ae dil hai mushkil in the break up song and in SOTY 2 in the hook up song. Now if an actress would have got so many chances like these then anyone can become as popular as Alia.

Like only for Arjit singh

Who dislikes Alia's video....after Sushant Singh death.
i love alia bhatt

plz upload full movie

I don&#39;t care if she is a 10th fail what I care for is her unique personality and talent❤because to be an actor you just need to act like pro and it doesn&#39;t matter if you are not good in studies... TALENT MATTERS FOR ME THAT&#39;S IT!!!I LOVE ALIA🤩🤗

<a href="">

After the death of our dearest DEAREST shushant  - shushant Singh  i can&#39;t watch nepotism queen <a href="">#AliaBhatt</a>

<a href="">

Alia is the most hardworking actress❤️❤️

Lgade daav p sb kch , agar dil RAAZI h .
She is awesome

You are a bastard
I like only this movie of aila this movie aliay acted so well otherwise i dont like alia bhatt other movies!

Alia Bhatt is from filmy background but I must tell you, she doesn&#39;t have the qualities of a starkid. She is unique,talented,hardworking and it&#39;s bcuz of her hardwork why she is at this place in her career. She is the most promising actresses and can we please not judge anyone bcuz of their Background but bcuz of their talent?

Arijit Singh❤❤❤❤❤❤

Idc what anyone says i still love Alia- She should not be blamed for anything :))

She is great ..😉🤟🤟Great..... Like this

Alia u. Are my  favourite  and this song  is best

Kangana or Prachi Desai better for this role

Overreacting

Alia nailed the role in it ..

Nepotism 😡 😡 😡 😡
Alia is may fav

Please share this movie link

Very nice song

If the heart is happy, then put it on the stake
Alia ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is real heroes of our country india (raw agents) ravindra kaushik,sehmat khan,ajit Deval,r.n kao

Crush India 😡😡
My failures are training me like him and I will surely beat them  . All the best to me 👍 . ..

I hate them who has disliked this video

Jai hind
I love Aalia

Alia you were my favourite actress But after Shushant Singh Rajput &#39;s death I came to know how you are 😒😒

I love this character of sehmet so much even I don&#39;t like alia

It is just that Alia gets good scripts n high budget movies otherwise Kriti is also wonderful,tapsee ,kangana ,radhika are better

Har star kid Not Deserving nahi hota...There is a big difference between Alia and Ananya..

Jo log Alia ko not deserving bolte he wo plz ek baar ye movie dekh lena fir bolna...

Alia bhatt didnot deserve this role at all.

Jo movie me bataya sb fake hh
Reality kuch orr h harinder sikka book semat calling read first

Alia  is tiiti sushant is hero

I think the casting of Alia Bhatt in this movie looks wrong. In all physical fighting scenes she looks really weak. See <a href="">1:00</a>. It looks like shooting scene. They are changing the angles so quickly so we cannot clearly see the non existant fight. We have seen Dangal, Naam Shabana, where actresses had a chance to do action. Hell, even Zeenat Aman seemed better...

I LOVE THIS SONG. Alia bhatt is so smart in this movie . I love  Alia bhatt .

Hats off to this movie director because he made a no.1 movie.I saluted to this song

Please ,listen the statement of real writer of this movie, &#39;calling sehmat&#39;

Bollywood you always have to defame India . For those who don&#39;t know the ending was changed from the novel to appease the Pakistanis

❤Raazi Hain
Nice Motivational song

More power to alia :)

<a href="">1:53</a> se baki ka part wow

jai ho .... arijit singh ❤❤❤❤
Alia Bhatt is a star kid but I love her because she makes used of the privilege she get and give justice to it.. She give justice to every character she play.. No doubt the finest actor.. Love you Alia

Alia did justice to this role and played it very well.
Plz itni hateness thee k nhi h alia k liye wo deserve krti h her acting skill z gud.....

Bygot Karo Pgl Alia bhatt ki movi ka. Our Susan Sir has cited the reason for this. I hate aliya bhatt
Alia Bhatt's best film till date, you will always remember everyone for this film.
Even sri Rama went to exile for 14 years but she gave up her whole life,dreams and everything for her father..

Now hating an actor just bcoz some1 from their family was in the Bollywood industry isn&#39;t right. You are hating her just because of her parents were in industry, not because she is not good actor. Pls look at the actors talent not at their family pls guys it&#39;s a request 🙏Otherwise the kids that are born in

Piz mowee rakna
So much hate comments for Alia but everybody knows none of those actors would have done the role better than Alia!

Hello

1 dislike for Mahesh Bhat&#39;s daughter.... 👎

Alia is a great actress!!

BOLLYWOOD KILLED SUSHANT. BOYCOTT NEPOTISM KIDS LIKE ALIA BHATT.

More power to you Alia! People are blaming her without any proof of what happened. Alia is very talented. Is there any other nepo actress that can pull of a movie like Raazi on her own? If you&#39;re targetting nepotism then target the ones without any talent.

Hats off to a daughter like Sehmat who left everything for her nation and Alia Bhatt who effortlessly created the magic of Sehmat on the silver screen.

Alia bhat 👍👍👍👍👍
I hate you alia

Aliya is a good actor, but getting hate comments because she is part of Nepotism. Her Sister Shaheen was suffering from depression, but she overcomes it and wrote a book about her suffering.  But when her family got to know about Shushant no one came to help for him, this is why she is getting this hate message,.

I just hate aliya

One of the Best movies of Alia 💛💛

Why is this against pakistan???!?!??  Just why?????

<a href="">#boycottaliabhatt</a>
Alia Bhatt 10th failed

I m waiting for the day when she will ban from Bollywood

Baxmisam bu kinoya.

We hate u alia

Go to hell Alia bhatt.....😈😈👎👎

I hate starkid

Such a wonderful girl😍❣<a href="">#foreveralia</a>🌸
 this movie

No one&#39;s talking about the <b>brilliant</b> music, the nuanced layering, Arijit&#39;s rendition, and the surreal mixing of folk music in this amazing composition. This album is criminally underrated. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, take a bow

I want to watch this movie but it is not being downloaded.
Alia is such a little girl
Alia is a good actress. 🥰🥰🥰
Alia is best 😍😍

As a human she is bad but as an actress she is very good

Her acting skills are AMAZING

If the heart is happy, whose heart is happy?
Even though she is talented she is not the only one, everyone deserves to get a chance to show their talent. Otherwise their will be more suicides, joblessness, casting couch, bullying etc.Stop nepotism it will spread if not.Edits: It&#39;s easy to say that it&#39;s not her fault, unless you are on place of a struggling talented actors/actress. She was purposely given too many films bcoz of her father and not her talent. First see news then be a hawaldar/chaukidar for star kids.

I dont want to watch the film of a 12th pass..

Alia bhatt😍😍
She is just pass 12 th..u and u r father said Sushant is not talend..very funny..he is a rang Holder in india..don&#39;t support star kids..

Aliya ,💨
People blame her for his death when they themselves never watched Sushant&#39;s films. Sonechirya was a gem but it didnt do that well. While veere di wedding did 100+ crores. They are the same people that criticised and abused him for Raabta. If the audience had watched his films he would get bigger movies. Stop trying to blame others when you are equally responsible 😒 Edit:Also, please stop spreading baseless rumours about her. Things like &quot;Sushant who&quot; was not even said by her.  I thought you all were against mental harrasment and emotional lynching ? Or is that okay when it happens to star kids ?

Dislike for aliya bhatt 😈
I hate alia Bhatt. A girl who  just pass 12

Arijit singh is best fan 💖💖💖 you fan like karo

Zee Company Bast

Every father should proud if they have daughter like this.

If I get chance then love to say RIP Alia Bhatt 🤬😠😡

Very bad song

The story is a tribute to everyone who risk their life for saving other lives irrespective of their country of origin. The protagonist&#39;s sacrifice was one such act and deserves real respect from all human beings.  Boundaries are man made. Love, compassion and humanity  is God&#39;s will.

Motivating song
Underrated song

Kisko kisko pasand hai ye song

Hats off to such daughter who left everything just her  father asked her toNever received so many likes 😘

Sad thing is the best spies never get busted. We will never know them.

Takes a lot of Courage to work as an Indian Spy and that too in a Country like Pakistan. While watching the film, I was having goosebumps , can&#39;t imagine the pain the real Sehmat had during this mission. She was no less than a Solider. Salute to Sehmat. May you get born in India again as my daughter.

Osm movie 😘😘😘😘
Love your acting in the movie #<a href="">#Razi</a>♡♤

I don't know who will kill the country, who sacrificed his whole life for the country or for so many hours, I can't thank him for his words..salute to Sehmat Ma'am.
Patriotism resides in RAGON; What is the need for these words?

The bets are on your diligence, The scar is still fresh, Put your heart on the line, If your heart consents. If your heart consents... Where the heart carries you, The possibilities are limitless, In diligence if we lose our lives, Of course! For this is the frontier. The unaccomplished lies ahead, The vanquished lie behind. Put your heart on the line, If your heart consents. If your heart consents... Ohh... Mind the winds while you walk, And don&#39;t step on the bare earth, Lest your footprints get left behind. Instead, burn in your own fire! The bets are on your diligence, The scar is still fresh, Put your heart on the line, If your heart consents. If your heart consents... Hmm... If your heart consents.

&quot;Put your heart on the line, If your heart consents.. If your heart consents.&quot;

Plz upload raazi  full movie
