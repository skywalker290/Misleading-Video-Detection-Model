I’m sad there aren’t more views I think this is one of my favourite videos

I finally thought pewds was starting a cooking series... but instead it&#39;s this shit

Best pewdiepie this style looks better when you play games (the ratio of your camera and where its placed) and pewds please stop playing minecraft and terraria. Play a wide range of variety of games. There is assassins creed unity, uncharted 4, hitman 2, spiderman, red dead redemption 2, so many good and genuinely fun titles. Minecraft gets boring after a while and that&#39;s why you want to quit minecraft and terraria. Play whatever you want try random games

Felix: Lobsters are Crustaceans, not Arthropods. Ants are arthropods. &quot;Arthropod&quot; means &quot;joint foot&quot;. Anthropod isn&#39;t a word. If it was, it might mean &quot;human foot&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t.

Super

Alright wanna know I&#39;m a pakistani

What&#39;s this game&#39;s name?

This is the most intense crab rave I’ve seen so far.

I remember seeing this game played by the soothouse. And from the looks of it, the developer has improved the graphics quite a lot. Im impressed

What is in my avatar ?

How Pewdiepie Saved Us From The Matrix:We live in an alternate timeline from The Matrix.  Originally the Matrix would arise as a result of the developers of the game “Bear Simulator”’s massive success.  They became a titanic corporation that advanced VR technology hundreds of years into the future.  They also developed robots, which would eventually enslave humanity and force us into our own virtual world to be fuel, as in “The Matrix.”  However since Felix played and hated their game, trashing it and causing its development to end, the developers never rose to power and created the technology that would be our downfall.  This alternate timeline will actually be discovered in the new Matrix movie, which will a central plot plot, with alternate timeline Felix as the new Neo.

Did Jordan Peterson make this game?!

I thought this was a mukbang

&#39;This movie is based on a true story&#39;the movie:

Can you asmr?

Mukbang?

Is it bad it took me some time to realize anthropod was wrong? I legit forgot it was arthropod.

glad you played this game, it&#39;s a masterpiece

Its not anthropod you dumb swede its ARTHROPOD this entire video was spent with you screaming &quot;man feet&quot; at a lobster

Anyone gonna tell him that they aren&#39;t anthropods?? :D

This is highly similar to zone of the enders, and its making me uncomfortable.

what name of game tell plz

arthropods?
Why did I get a notification that it was released today, when everyone else is commenting 3 days ago...

“He’s shooting lasers!”WWIII vibes:Heyyyy 
LONG LIVE THE KING!

“Or even bettah, shrimp”
I thought the video is all about eating food. I mean mukbang.

Lowkey disappointed that this wasnt a pewdiepie mukbang even though the thumbnail is clearly photoshopped

Take a shot every time Pewds says Anthropod(s).

This game is the result of a bunch of computer programmers on drugs

Did pewds use a Star Wars reference “Powerrrrr, unlimited powerrrr”

Swim lobster swim. What?

Is it just me or I thought he was going to eat 

Sometimes I don&#39;t even know what the heck was going on in this gameplay xd

I swear I&#39;ve seen this game somewhere before but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on where

My brother is starting to look more and more like pewds and it’s mind fucking me

Hi, there is a baby here in Brazil called Marina, who was diagnosed with a degenerative disease and needs a medicine that sells in the United States for about 2 million dollars. The value is already very large in dollars and arrives even more expensive in Brazil, costing approximately 9 million reais (the minimum wage per month is 900 reais). I came here to ask for your help because I believe you, PewDiePie and all followers can make a difference in the life of this family, they are trying very hard to get this medicine.Marina&#39;s parents have created an instagram to publicize the cause and intend to travel to the United States when they raise it, but they must gather before she is 2 years old.I count on you and everyone reading to accomplish what may be your greatest solidarity action.Marina Instagram@cureamarina

Felix, are you sure you didn&#39;t mean &#39;Arthropod?&#39; Arthropods are the family of crustaceans and insects while &#39;anthropods&#39; is just bipeds for the most part.

PewDiePie killed a crab which is a arthropod so does that mean he killed his own empire since he wanted the Arthropods to rise

LONG LING THE KING!

This is a testament to why I love Japan.

Pewds: me names lobster GonzalesGamers: 
&quot;Long Ling The King&quot;

You know you love PewDiePie when you watch a game you’re not interested in at all and laugh the whole time

At Schoole the pewdieppie called pewdieppie are load and saver

Artificial shrimpppppp

I&#39;ve never seen him make a thumbnail like that. Normally it&#39;s just the same face different backgrounds 

<b>just a normal day on the sea</b>

Crustaceans etc are arthropods. Anthropology is the study of people

Krufsky kragh

Multiplayer version needed

This remind me of tier zoo

High ground
“I’ve never been engaged in a fight like this”<b>Sad Pewdiepie vs T-series noises</b>

LONG LING THE KING!

Please play pogo stuck

*Arthropods*...
Lol an anthropod is a humanoid robot thing. Arthropod is what ya mean.

long ling the king

i&#39;ve never even heard of this game before and im just so confused

Well, I guess it is time to go and update the lobster Wikipedia page!

Who would win; Critikal fish or Pewdiepie fish??????

He hasn’t fought the real threats yet<b>bane of arthropods enchantment intensifies</b>

yes we have lasers

PewDiePie: <b>sees dolphins</b>Also PewDiePie: “we answer to no seals”

I’m struggling to comprehend that this game really exists and that I want to play it so badly.

Anthropods, assemble!
Bismarck has nothing to do with Nazis

Pewdiepie for days
God dammit that game it&#39;s absolutely trashhhh

<b>I was Expecting a Mukbang Video ( ≧Д≦)</b>
What the hell

<b>thanks, I hate It</b>

attack from aboo-o-o-o-ove

So this is why lobster is so expensive

@seemann_luca (on instagram)
There&#39;s something you need to know at <a href="">6:07</a>. As a viewer of South Korea, it is not politically ill-intentioned... What you need to know is that red flag behind that submarine is a flag symbolizing Japan’s old imperialism, and if you think it means the same thing as the Nazis, you’ll soon understand.

And the fact that such a pattern appears in the video game is heartbreaking for viewers in Korea. Thank you for watching my story so far

The attacks look like DBZ ki blasts.

Lobbi-Wan Kenobster: It&#39;s over Bismarck! I have the High Ground.Lobbi-Wan Kenobster: Gets blasted by BismarckBismarck: You underestimated my power!

I can&#39;t believe they made a Jordan Peterson game!

Why is this game unironically so good?

Pewds version on a seafood mukbang

Markiplier: Was That the Bite of &#39;87?!PewDiePie: Is that a Shark?!

By the thumbnail I thought this was gonna be another documentary

This makes me feel like I’m watching the history channel at 3 AM

wtf i thought this is a mukbang video

Anyone notices he mis spelled Arthropods?

So, this is what it means to live the life of Larry the Lobster

I feel like he really doesn&#39;t know how to pronounce homing but if you say to him that its wrong he&#39;ll just say it was a joke

Finally my sword wont be useless

I knew it was Critikal 

Prob got this idea from Charlie(Cr1TiKal)Edit: HE DID, CALLED IT

Wys I have 10000 hours in this game.

Ace of seafood

Ahh I love sea creatures
They should have added the pufferfish as a playable character

Thought for a sec pewdiepie turned into a food channel

Play warthunder
Anthropod King &gt;&gt;&gt; Crab KingQuestion mark
So this is what goes on in a lobsters mind

is it arthropod hour already?

WTF!! Am i watching?

@seemann_luca (on Instagram)
Why has my master not talked about what the best meme of the decade was

BEHOOOOOOOOOLD!For too long you have been farting in the darkness...

I thought this was gonna be a Mukbang video

Local anthropoid does the 7 page muda on a bigger sea creature that is bigger than him

This is the dark souls of crustaceans

yeet

i found the picture for the vid it from jaeyeol asmr lol

the media&#39;s thought that pewds works with nazis, but in reality, he is fighting with nazis

This is what happens in the other 95% of the the ocean

I&#39;m watching this drunk asf, and to be honest I don&#39;t know what tf is going on

I lowkey thought that this was a muckbang

What I if told you You read this wrong

This is so deep

This is legitimately intresting

Felix: I’m taking a break Also Felix: <b>screaming as a lobster</b>

Game: if you attack other creatures, the battle begins. USA military drone: <b>IMMA END THIS MANS WHOLE CAREER</b>

Spiny lobster gang Will rule over the mafia.

Pewds: Or even better........... SHRIMPAlso pewds: <b>Spiny Lobster it is</b>

I hate when people edit comments

I&#39;m a 20yo girl and I love watching Pews videos even tho I haven&#39;t played video games EVER

I THOUGHT PEWDIEPIE WAS DOING MUKBANG 
Lock on target lion fish kill.

[Jordan Peterson liked that.]

Controversial pewdiepie wants to penetrate Bismarck!!1!1!1!

Ace combat is looking like a fever dream.

Isn’t it arthropod? Not anthropod? “Anthro” usually means humanlike and creatures with an exoskeleton are arthropods

<b>*sad isopod noises*</b>

<a href="">8:52</a> <b>global warming isn’t real: this is what’s really happening!</b>

This game gives me crab rave vibes

Your crap T Series is better

Isopod time

I spent half the video tryina flip the screen

The whole video I was thinking about how he made the thumbnail

Kol pipiShrab kaka

Blue submarine 06 had better graphics hAHa

@gavriko_v if interested)))
Who else thought the thumbnail looked like a mukbang thumbnail 

Who is Russian like :))
i thought he was doing a mukbang for a second there

So...what&#39;s the name of the game?

Reality Check!

“Long ling the king”

Hooray for the anthro-pewds!!

What the hell !! I thought its mockbang video

Felix Shellberg

Isopod gang
If every living thing had these abilities it would be top 10 anime battles every day

You should do better videos instead of gaming that’s why t series past you

I literally thought this was a mukbang

I thought the the thumbnail was real and should have known Better . It’s pewds

My Instagram antonin.georges

Somehow this reminds me of that manga &quot;Gyo&quot; by Junji Ito, but without the gas tanks

what is this game

I taught you are Jeol ASMR because of your thumbnail 

&quot;Anthropods&quot;
So this is what fish do while we think they&#39;re just swimming there peacefully.

Seeing the giant lobster attacking Bismark was like watching an old gozilla movie xD

Imagine going scuba diving and you see a shrimp shooting Lazars

This comment section is terrible &quot; copy and paste &quot;

Anthrosquad rise up
Play call of duty

Moist Critikal giving out video ideas

I thought it was a good vlog

Why does the aiming mechanics looks like a figter jets but instead youre shooting homing missle from an arthopods&#39;s ass

I thought this was gonna be a PewDiePie cooks a lobster video.

This game is amazing. Thanks for showing me this pewds

<b>LONG LING THE KING</b>

Felix has achieved peak masculinity

&quot;Long live the king&quot;Continues shooting at the king.

&quot;Stingray , it must be powerful&quot;-FelixAlso Stingray:*killed Steve Irwin

I thought it said Arthropod until I heard him say Anthropod

this game should be called accurate ocean simulator

Who ever made this game obviously is part GOD because no mere mortal would be able to think of this on their own

“This comment section is horrible”Everyone: copies and pasties

Year 2000: Think what we will be creating 20 years from now!2020: game about lobsters shooting lasers

I always thought it was a&quot;n&quot;thropod though I learned it is arthropod three months ago so it&#39;s okay I guess lol

Anthropods translated means human legs Pewdiepie said rise of anthropodsIs he hinting that he is modifying his body and adding some legs?

Wow I never realised there was a Kim Jong un lobster in the ocean

Thank god it&#39;s not a Mukbang

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, her soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, she chose the path of perpetual torment. In her ravenous hatred she found no peace; and with boiling blood she scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged her. She wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of her sword named her… satania.
