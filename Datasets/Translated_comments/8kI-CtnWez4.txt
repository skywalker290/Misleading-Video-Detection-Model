i feel so bad for connor trolololol

he heard that wall of flesh put u in hardmore so he thinks its the hardest boss

Pewds comment section has always been the worst for repeated comments 💀 🤣

&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;Platera at the surface:💀Moonlord:💀Daytime EoL:☠️

Connor 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Pewds I hate the batsMe 😂😂😂

meanwhile empress of light daytime :

i was so afraid to fight &quot;wall of flesh&quot; and i made so much preparation, at last when i fought it, it died under 2 minutes

Mechanical bosses, Plantera, Golem, EOL, Lunatic cultist, moon boi and greatest of them all SLIME KING left the chat.

Bro this is not hardest boss in 1st this is its moonlord its the world hardest boss ever!

fart   in jar hahaha

Hardest???WORLD RECORD???!!

Jesus pewds reached hardmode faster than me

No that not hardest boss it&#39;s the impress of light on day time

Wof on master mode: bonjour Beenades: adios

&quot;That was four minutes!&quot;, &quot;He h h heeh h he he&quot;

Why pewd hate Connor

Society if Connor the Guide didn’t exist: <b>how do i craft the Zenith?</b>

Bro hates conner
This woukd have been much betyer without chat, discovering stuff like the wall of flesh is really fun and its much more satisfyijg figuring out how to kill these thigns yourself. Rather than having chat spoil everything and telling you exactly what to do

<a href="">20:58</a> most brutal and tragic betrayal in history

He still doesn&#39;t know that he can just go through the door without opening ut

why does he hate connor so muchhhhhh

<a href="">12:24</a>

CONNER NOOOOOOO😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😢😢😢😢
Are we just going to ignore the fact that pewds did not know what aglet was even after p&amp;f did a whole bomb ass song on it ?

pewdiepie: hating on a fart jokealso pewds: <b>makes a game that is litreally about shit</b>

I enjoy this playlist so much

Connor&#39;s been through a lot man.

its not even the 5th hardest lol

egg
Why bro hate connor

The hardest boss isn&#39;t wall of flesh it&#39;s moon lord, duke fishron, empress of light

No its not the hardest boss the hardest boss was probably the twins and moon lord

hallo    By    Mrbin
Famous last words: &quot;ooo it&#39;s a dynamite, it go boom boom&quot;yes felix, it go boom boom.

Honestly, Terraria has the worst backseat gamers.

Conner 💔
bro that wasnt connor that was levi 💀

Killing bunnies is cruel. PERIOD.

Duke Fishron, Empress of Light, Moon Lord: Thats Funny..

@<a href="">12:00</a> jojo
Hahaha I already beat moonlord 10x I got the zenith

Dungeon guardian:
Jadda
Subscribe now 😜

The intense breathing at <a href="">14:34</a> tho

Empress of light: am i a joke to you?

Pewdiepie randomly developing his animosity towards Connor was funny.

Can&#39;t believe that there&#39;s still people commenting and watching

<a href="">6:47</a> clearly he hasn’t seen that Phineas and Ferb episode

Queen Slime, The Mechanical Bosses,Plantera,Golem,Lunatic Cultist,The pillars,Moonlord,and Empress Of light is cry laughing

PewDiePie from the beginning would have made 3 episodes from this just off the fact he wasn&#39;t smart enough TO GO INTO THE HIVE

Well, thats not the hardest part, the hardest part comes after killing the wall

PewDiePie: wall of flesh is the hardest boss<b>Moon lord: you sure about that</b>

<a href="">2:54</a> he deserved it. he didn’t go in your house in part 1

It&#39;s the Hardest Boss in Pre-Hardmode Bro🗿

Calamity player: heh *smug

I beated empress of light first try

It&#39;s funny how he says it&#39;s the hardest and last boss of the game, he hasn&#39;t even seen half the game 😂

<a href="">0:16</a> “connor”

If you think, its boss hardest, just try to defeat Impress of light, at the day

That wasnt even Connor.... Connor died sometime last episode I think

Still waiting for pewds to finish the game

granite in minecraft: mehgranite in terraria: SHINY PURPLE BLOCK

nice

Hardest boss is NOT wall of fleshHardest boss is...MoonlordANDEmpress of light

SO YOURE TELLING ME CAPTIAN SAPRKLEZ STARTS TERRERIA AND THE YOU DO THIS IS AWESOME

sadly

why connor

“This game is adorable” <b>fights a literal wall of flesh a few minutes later</b>

you&#39;re on easy mode and what about empress of light no hit????

Epic! He went into hardmode with 0% preparations! But since he defeated the bee and the thicc wirm without an arena is a sign that he is a &quot;veteran&quot;

Make the strongest sword of terraria

Pewds I beat the hardest boss Literally every Hardmode boss “ima end this man’s hole career “

Yo

&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;Hardcore bosses be like: <b>&quot;art thou challenging me&quot;</b>

Poor conor
CONNER CONNER CONNER CONNER

The way he behaves with connor reminds me of watership.

Yo mrbeast playing terraria 💀

<a href="">10:00</a>

5 up 9

Pewds: &quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;Empress of Light (Daylight): I take that as a personal insult.

It&#39;s cute how he thinks that is the hardest boss

“What’s an a-aglet?”<b>Phineas and Ferb want to know your location</b>

&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;You mean hard mode enteribg boss?

<a href="">13:27</a> best part hahahah
Poor Connor we will miss you:(

you know that wall of flesh is gonna spawn if you throw the voodoo doll in the lava

&quot;you dont even hurt! You bastard little turd!&quot;
Every time pewdiepie swears, it sounds he’s dropping the base

Currently binge watching watching early Terraria vids of Pewds. Can&#39;t wait to see him know suffering on Master mode because the game is so easy in Normal mode. Hahaha

Levi be like O.O who is connor

it is NOT the hardest boss

bro im still tryna beat deerclops...

*Easiest

&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;Everyone: <b><i>There Is another</i></b>

Is it me, or does PewDiePie look like &quot;Sting&quot; (-a musician who was more popular in the 1980s &amp; &#39;90s &amp; was in the band &quot;Police&quot; before going solo)

Empress Of Light?

8terre=================================================

PewDiePie:I beat the hardest boss!Moonlord and empress of light:how about no

The r r ia r i a
I never watched this series because I thought I did not like this game. Now I am addicted and I went back to this. I thought maybe I could get some inspiration on how to kill the moonlord but unfortunately you stopped playing pretty early in hardmode... 🥺 What a pity. I actually don&#39;t know how far you came in the livestream part of this series but I am not a member so I can&#39;t watch. So I wish you a good start and time in Japan and hope that maybe you get back to terraria 🤣

Poor Connor...
He never even beat the moon lord

Can you do anything

The hardest boss huh?

Thank you cause when I saw the thumbnail, my mind told me to play terraria

Pewds: I beat the hardest boss first tryMe: ever heard of skeletron prime?

pewds i have done everything the 50 other bosses  thats cute

Pew pew: i beat the hardest boss 1st try!Duke fishron: thats funMoonlord: thats cuteEmpress of light: thats <b>adorable</b>

p

Make another video on terraria plz

so funny
Rip the guide didn&#39;t even do anything, the bunnie DeShawn, and Connors being bullied for it

<a href="">20:45</a> I want to say this but with a different reason it&#39;s just so satisfying when he says it it makes me feel relaxed

“get the freak outta my house i’m playing terraria” 😂

We want expert mode...

i spent a week of my life trying to craft the nights edge

Skeletron

And skeleton and eye of Cthulhu

I kill the wall of flesh

Pls... play terraria again pewds

He should play in hard mode now.

There are 3 bosses in the jungle

<a href="">22:28</a> song name?

honestly king slime was harder than wall of flesh the first time I fought them

Pewdiepie: Immunity to poison. LAME!Ankh charm: Am I a joke to you?

waith wof isn&#39;t hard if u know how

It&#39;s funny how he just bully conner

Me with solar armor and the zenith, &quot;did someone say queen bee&quot;?

i defeated wall of flesh using 200+ beenade and made me lag.. but still i defeated it

But now u get hell stone ore and I don&#39;t know how to craft hellstone bar its the update shit

“I beat the hardest boss”

Empress of light: are you sure about that?

ITS LEVI NOT CONNOR.

<a href="">8:43</a>))))))

<a href="">7:35</a>)))))))))))))))

I just made a rope ladder straight to hell lol

Summoner pewdipie your a legend

“I killed the hardest boss!” Hard mode: well yes, but actually no

<a href="">22:28</a>  I can agree they can be annoying

The night vision helmet does work so well when it’s worn in the correct spot

Moon lord: thats cute

If you have a enchanting table you can click on it to make other  summon

I wish thats the hardes boss🤣

Wait till he learns how to dupe

bruh that boss is frickin weak!

&quot;So easy first try&quot; but you have people helping every single second telling you what you need to do next XD

<a href="">14:34</a>: “breathing intensifies”

Felix: <b>dies of fall damage</b>Also Felix: Hey Connor! you&#39;re a lowlife weasel a$$ B**H

<a href="">4:57</a> America when they find the Middle East

Thats like 3rd easiest boss xd

If you hate connor so much let him feel the fire of hell in the comfort of his home (voodoo doll)

<a href="">4:37</a> night vision helmet is not working becuase  u were wearing it  in vanity slots :/

I miss terraria before the update

Pewds: apart from you Conner&quot;Conner&quot;: Levi This was at the start  before he fought wall of flesh

No hate to minecraft but ay in minecraft can you get meteorite space armor and shoot a bunny with a musket exploding it into little pieces? Didnt think so lmaooo

Every time he kills a bunny i cant help but think of that vegan teachers glowing review of his channel

<a href="">3:07</a>:U.S cops

I wish he could play this again

For me the hardest boss is the “empress of light” in day time. I think the moon lord is more easy on insane mode

Me: sees titleAlso me: <b>What about daytime Empress of Light?</b>

PewDiePie is false advertising
F in the chat for us Connors

Hardest boss? Moonlord: an I a joke to you?

hi monica
pweds: i beat the hardest bossah, if he just knew...

.. Mans is flaming LEVI WHEN HE CAN SLICE TITANS AND THINKING HE IS CORNER.

Pewds: i beat the hardest boss on terrariaMe who beat empress of light on day: what did you say you little shit

“Im from the hood mutha fricka” I love you pewds no homo but you make my days better :3

When you beat what you think is the hardest boss but then sometime later you realize the enemies are now tougher than the boss itself

<a href="">13:05</a> My first reaction when I realized how to make water bottles the first time :/

Supreme calamitasCrabulonDragonfollyYharon

Especially i don&#39;t have a cyborg

I got the coin gun in the pirate invasion

Because i have all the sword

I have a zenith and a coin gun

Pew your not strong enough if you defeat the wall of flesh you Gana kill more boss you now the hardest boss is the God of Mon

<a href="">22:30</a> )))))))))))))))))))))))

<a href="">21:00</a>)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Lmao Wall of flesh is considered the hardest PRE-hard mode boss but it’s not the HARDEST boss

He was noob

Hold Up! Since when did Pewds started playing Terraria!🤣

Haha. He entered hardmode, but he discontinued the gameplay. Ironically, he has the no legs gang Moon Lord figure at his desk, even though he wasn&#39;t yet fighting the rest of the hardmode bosses, even Moon Lord and events...

Piediepie: I heated the hardest boss on first tryObsidian Time who killed him on expert mode without getting any damage at all: laughs in Russian

pewdiepie = 🙁 pew the pie =😎😎😎😎😎
Ayes the &quot;hardest boss&quot;

i beat wall of flesh 10 time&#39;s

I&#39;m a master of terraria

Connor probably has depression lol
Poor connor r.i.p
Uh... connor is now Levi....

Pewdie: What&#39;s this? hellwing bow..TRASH WHY DID YOU GIVE ME TRASH-

Pewds: i beat the hardest boss Day eol : am i a joke to you

As a terraria veteran this puts a tear in my eye. The experience of playing this game for the first time was so wonderful and to see pewdiepie feel that same thing is awesome

im really waiting for the hardmode episodes of this terraria series but still waiting

empress of light is waiting

Almost got messed up by a boulder trap and doesn&#39;t even know it

The doll is something about the npc that kills the npc

Ayo i beat both destroyer and the twins 1st try clutch on health on twins with deadalas storm bow and i got it on 2nd try 1st ded and cheesed the destroyer of worlds

When you think wall of flesh is hard

pewdiepie: i beat the hardest boss in terraria empress of light in day: SUPRISE MOTHER FUCKA

i defeated wall of flesh easier than him lol in first try

Not a world record, he&#39;s really good and all but it&#39;s not a world record, many people have beaten him first try like I have. Not here to spread hate just saying...

Im beat the hardest boss 1st try and me and hardest boss we both die

I started watching pewdiepie when I was twelve. Now I&#39;m nine.

<a href="">5:50</a> the moment he knew. 😌🤣

Pewds: I defeated the hardest boss!Destroyer,twins,Betsy,queen slime,skeletron prime, plantera, golem,duke fishron, lunatic cultist, empress of light,mothron, dreadnautilus, frost legion, Santa NK1, ever scream, ice queen, mourning wood, pumpking, Martian saucer,  Flying Dutchman, sand elemental, moon lord, solar,vortex,nebula and solar pillar and goblin summoner: that’s cute

<a href="">00:16</a> that’s not choner that LEVI

Someone should of have told him to equip it and hit conor

Someone should of have told him to equip it and hit conor

Me: nothin just using the star cannon to defeat WoF

Still waiting for part 6

<a href="">19:17</a> hahahaha

<a href="">4:37</a> he wears it in vanity slot

Pewdiepie: i beat the hardest boss in 1st tryMechanical bosses: how cutePlantera: adorable

Pewdiepie: i hate you connerHard mode: allow me to introduce my self

connor goes swimming in the lava

There are like 8 more bosses lol.

This chad beats the wall of flesh on episode 5

Aww PewDiePie killed the wall! I&#39;m so proud of him, but good luck with Moon Lord.

Duke fishron) PITHETIC

(Moon lord) weak

moon lord is mad now

Flare guns r for light

Hey PewDiePie 1 tip u need a bee grenade so wall of flesh can be easier to kill

I beat the moon lord with Zenith i got every achivement to

Why did the bull watch hentai?He heard of…Rule thirty HORN

At least with my skill set, wall of flesh is definitely the hardest and least fun boss.Edit: Refighting it is also almost as annoying as the moon lord.

Honestly I’ve had over 100 hrs on terraria and I did the same thing he did with water this morning

Also for anyone in 2021 the hardest boss is Empress of Light now.

Who&#39;s gonna tell him that this isn&#39;t the hardest boss in Terraria???

<a href="">14:19</a> lol

<a href="">0:43</a>

A year ago

You went right in front the bee hive

<a href="">15:15</a> the most American accent

In <a href="">0:31</a>I just realized that Sive put in a Sam &amp; Max screenshot. I find that pretty neat :]

hardest boss... sure
Anyone 2021?

my guide&#39;s name was also connor but i treated him like a fucking god like if there was a blood moon i would do all i could to protect him

i like how he beat every single boss first try except king slime

pewdiepie: Wall of flesh is ezpewdiepie + water = PewDiePie: I ded

<a href="">21:43</a> I am utterly disturbed. I really don&#39;t wanna do this to my guide who&#39;s been there for me since day one.

Fun fact Connor/Guide is Wall of flesh

<b>Hardmode Bosses : *im boutta end this mans whole career</b>

Welcome to hardmode pewds where everything is harder than the boss that u just beat

Well pewdiepie isn&#39;t it a little late to upload a LP of you? It can 2014 on steam ._.I don&#39;t want to put hate there just a little reminder

Do you have legendary zenith?

Well if you&#39;re difficulty is master call it not first try

The Connor montage showed how much he loved Connor and will regret killing him

I beat the hardest boss!Us terraria experts ruining his joy

Bot

<a href="">5:59</a> boom

Conors water sheep 2.0, for real

Did he ever get or make a bucket so he can get the liquid honey? Does he even know how to dupe liquids?

Bruh you can use star gun to beat it the best gun

Master mode or classic mode?

U have gone this far and still don&#39;t know that u can just walk right through the door without clicking on it. This is dumb but i like it my bro.

Did it pain anybody else to watch him find the bee hive immediately and not know it

easy. Expert mode queen bee she will destroy you.0

Expert or normal mode. Normal is eazy.

Queen bee has 3400 health in normal mode?

Ikea actually looked dope ngl

just find more black chests in hell,there is a flaming mace that attacks while defending you,it does this by when you are charging up an attack,you spin it around you,dealing masive damege to the enemy.

When he reforged the nightmare pickaxe even though it was already on agile😂😂😂

So... Connor= Watersheep?

Pewdiepie being a tsundere to connor

What makes the shift from Love to Hate for Connor even sadder is the fact he was the previous hero just trying to help you along

Just realized at the end he says cyka blyat

i died when he put the night vision helmet on his cosmetic section and was still mad when it didn’t work

&quot;You cant hurt what is already fill with hurt&quot; <del>PewDiePie</del>

As being named Connor this playthrough has been... rude.

<b>cough</b> <b>cough</b> mate idk how to tel lyou but that nightvision helmet you put it in the helemet thingy not on the middle thingy

you sure its the hardest boss?

Noob!

When i saw him get water walking boots i was so mad i was looking for those for hours to make terraspark boots. If anyone has a good underworld mob farm that works pre hardmode that would be great. (I need obsidian rose)

ISNT A AGLET THE THING ON YOUR SHOE 🧐🧐🧐
CONNOR DIED HIS GUIDE IS NAMED LEVI WTFFF

more like debeeted
i like how he found the hive immediately but he didn’t break in

All people:  first

“I feel like I’ve done everything in the game” I want to see him kill the moon lord

Lol he died on a toilet

This dude should play calamity or thorium

I know this is late but wof is not that hard

A star cannon is OP on the wall of flesh,maybe next time u can use that it will b faster

Pewds: i beat the hardest boss on the game!Moon lord: <b>MENACING INTENSLY</b>

The name of his guide now isLEVI

How tf did pewdiepie beat queen bee 😂

Pewds: I BEAT THE HARDEST BOSSMe and other Terarian vets: no

Minecraft when your bored: afk farms Terraria when your bored: “lets go to hell gamers”

Congrats you defeated the wall of flesh

W

Pewds should play modded terraria

It’s funny how he has to kill moon lord and he says he beat the hardest boss

The flashback moment of Connor was enough to make a grown man cry.

I did it first try but I was on like one heart

Tirraria

In the

I got big house $$

I was crying when Connor died he had a bad life and the editing made it worst for him

That sad montage got me laughing so hard

Really hardcore  terraria player are cringing at pewds being a noob

Oy got quick tip:get 2 or more itemsThen split them your item will increase

Is no last boss
My guy the hardest is moonlord

If i could play with pewdiepie i would give him a zenith or the solar flare set

he put the night vision goggles in vanity...

Me a summoner main pewdiepie uses bee armor for MELEE my cringe level: ITS OVER 9000
Can you pls play terraria again😭🥺
Pewdipie:night vision is a lie. When he had it in the vannati slot

i used a random tp potion and i spawned in a beehive and accidentally spawned the queen bee

Why are the comments in here are recents?

Dude pewdiepie thats not connor thats levi

&quot;The hardest Boss&quot; So who&#39;s gonna tell him?

<a href="">3:08</a>  American police

You can summon the Qween bee in the jungle

Hahahah he thinks the wof is the hardest boss! Wait till he fights skeletron prime or the twins

Pewdiepie: &quot;I dont know why it&#39;s so funny, it&#39;s like guns in minecraft.&quot;*Terraria ranger class has left the. chat.

PewDiePie: I beat the hardest boss!!!Moon lord: am I a joke to you?

Fvkin conners?
I BEATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT           MOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN         LORDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

echdeath be like: YoU SuRe AbOuT DaT

What about moon lord =/

Not Connor but Levi btw this is my moms account

Its sad the Guide has the same name as me

I have spent hours in hard mode trying to got a bezoar PewDiePie in pre hard mode: ez

<a href="">0:15</a> connor or Levi?

Title : i beat the hardest bossThumbnail : wall of fleshMoonlord : hehe smol brain go brrrrr

beats wall of fleshHARDEST BOSS FIRST TRYSupreme calamitas: cute owo

more

Woah ur just the halfway to beat the game

That boss is wall of flesh

I have never seen anyone use the guide as much as Felix has

<a href="">4:48</a> Osama the exploder: so relatable!Just made a terrorist joke. Sorry, but what are you going to do about it? Think about that...

<a href="">14:35</a> me panicking huhhuhHuhuhhHUh
The worlds hardest boss in terraria is moon lord and also keep subscribing for this channel to beat t series

<a href="">0:16</a> levi in attack on titan?wow

that was not the strongest

When your names Connor 😔

Thats not the hardest boss

Felix in the jungle be like<b>where bee</b>

Who should tell him that that was one of the easy ones and that there are more to come

Hardest uh um its empress of light

Making my way down town Conner took my kids I’m gonna jump off a bridge dadadadaddada

the wall of flesh  is easy

PewDiePie says I have nothing else to do like bro ur like 1/5 complete with the game

Nice summoner build.
It’s such a strange feeling when you go through terrorism and watch others go through it.
and that the first try

and NO the moon lord is not the best boss its the emperiss of light

and i beated the best boss without to die

there are more bosses in the game that was just the BEGINNING

?

PewDiePie: Uses Jump boots   Me: Uses UFO, Hell Goat and pirate ship to fly.

Whats difficulty is he playing?

I beat the HARDEST Boss on 1st TRY! Translation: I beat the wall of flesh on Normal mode (easy mode) first try

Pewdiepie: I beat the hardest boss on 1st tryMoonlord:am I a joke to you

<a href="">3:58</a> what song is this soo nostalgic

My opinion: “This has helped me out!”Link:“ 𝘼𝙋𝙋𝙄.𝙍𝙀𝙎𝙏 “Final conclusion: “I&#39;m glad I tried it.“&quot;<a href="">2:33</a>&quot;

Pewds: “I beat the hardest boss”Master mode empress of light during day: “Adorable”Edit: ayo didn’t know this got to 300 likes thanks and gg

Imagine not playing on master mode.

title: i beat the hardest boss!!moon lord: are you challenging me?!!?

its so annoying to watch him play cause hes such a noob

The guide&#39;s names levi so pewds killed connor offcam?

Dumbi

It’s not the hardest and I have world record for 5 seconds

terraria watches aot

Pewds:i beat the hardest boss!!😎 moon lord:time to die!!😡 calamity mod final boss:all of you are weak! <b>shoots lazer at pewds</b>

Watching Felix start as melee, switch to mage, switch to Ranger, switch to Summoner, then switch back to Melee is driving me insane.

Also keep fighting queen bee cuz it has a small chance of giving u honeyed goggles which summons a fast flying rideable bee

Also keep that poison immuniy ting, because later it makes the op ankh shield. Using ur shield, that, and other random things

Never Thought there could even be 1 mil views on terraria terrria, pewds got 6 mil

PewDiePie is the god of gamer LOVEEEE YOUUUU PEWDIEPIE

Ikea tower looks like a d*ck and you can&#39;t unsee that

You need a new editor bruh. Miss the old pewds vibes

On a Switch you need 20 hellstone bars to craft the phoenix blaster

I beat the wall of flesh first try too but i died once

There is a thing in the snow that has two life crystles and a chest

The hardest boss you say?

Moonlord: am i a joke to you?Duke Fishron: WHAT?Pewdie:Everyone reading: WTAF is this guy saying ?Dunno But thx for reading XD

probaly the plantera is stupid

Little did he know that was just the beginning...

Mate that&#39;s not the hardest boss

Felix got the compass, we know what this means... He&#39;s gonna luck his way to getting the cell phone.

Poor connor
You need to have explosive bunnies in a cage to instakill it

Fitst off hes not hard second off not world record

IS HELL BATS AND LAVA BAT

Every other boss in hardmode: am I a joke to you?

Get the axe

Pewds: “Hardest boss”Moon lord: “Ima end this mans whole career”

PETA when they don&#39;t get anyone to stop eating meat: <a href="">4:48</a>

Connor is the new water sheep

Why does Felix hate me so much D:

Boomstick will forever be in my heart.

and NPCs does not want a crowd place there must be 3 NPCs in their respective biome to be happy enough to get a prylon

that is NOT the last boss,prepare yourself to battle moon lord

Oof we had the same health

It&#39;s not a lie you put it in the vanity slot

E

I feel so bad for the guide):

<b>proceeds to look away with 5 moon lord corpses in hand</b>

Felix’s second Terraria run in 1.4 ended up the exact same way as his first run: Barely progressing in hardmode after failing to defeat a mechanical boss.

<a href="">20:57</a> Damn that&#39;s emotional

Moon lord is harder idוot

Pewdiepie: I HAVE DONE THE HARDEST BOSS IN THE GAME!!!Veterans: there is another

“Hardest boss”

Poor Connor...I cried ;(

Pewdiepie: HARDEST BOSS SO HARD TO BEATMe with my good items: Kills the wall of flesh multiple times in hard mode because my guide had a bad name

Pewdiepie: calls hellwing bow garbage The entire ranger main community: do you want to die?

Wings and make it so you don’t die from fall damage

you can use the grappling hook to take no fall damage if you shoot it down while falling

Pewdiepie: Beats WofWorld: The ancient spirits of light and dark have been releasedSpirits: allow us to introduce ourselves and our harder bosses Pewdiepie: ...Imagine thinking Wof was the hardest

RIP connor

The queen bee is in the hive and there should be a blob of honey with something that looks like a bee in it break it to summon queen bee or use abeenation.

He calls Levi the guide ‘Connor’

how do we break it to him that fleshy boi is not the hardest boss

C’MON IS THIS THE END OF THE SERIES?! YOU HAVEN’T EVEN BEAT THE GAME YET!

Im a veteran and i feel insulted

for me its the most basic boss just like the eye of chulchu lol

well wall of flesh is the hardest pre-hardmode but i fucking hate ocram

Old meme:get the f**k out of my room I’m playing Minecraft. New meme:get the f*ck out of my house I’m playing terraria

The wall of flesh is nowhere near the hardest boss and i defeated it 1st try so its not a world record

it&#39;s not the hardest boss in the game. its the hardest boss in prey hared mode sooooooo he lie

Pewd : i beat the hardest bossMe : CONNOR PREPARE THE MOON LORD

This video still has one of my favorite editing styles

I&#39;m salty skeleton has no video

Killing bunnies is cruel. Period.

I can beat wall of flesh in two hits with my terra blade

Who&#39;s Going To Tell Him

PewDieDiePie: <b>I BEATED THE HERDEST BOSS IN THE GAME</b>me: <i>there is another...</i>

Making my way down town with my Bitch shes gonna make me a sandwich tananananana

The title&amp;thumbnail clearly hasn&#39;t seen the moon lord

Heh hardest boss?

the reason he’s doing this to connor is bc he opened a door

I beat terraria

&quot;i beat the hardest boss in terraria&quot; hard mode &quot;am i a joke to you&quot; calamity mod &quot;complete silence&quot;

The bees... Pffft was protecting felix in terraria and went in minecraft !

LMAOOOOOOOOOO dude we should play some time

Hey, when I was fighting WOF, my heart literally pounds every time the scary boi came.My heart rate must be 200 BPM from thatScrew hard mode man,

The hardest is empress of light

I’d beat calamity death mode every boss with a bubble gun I am exasted

Terraria is Minecraft but you downloaded 2000000000000000000000 mods

<a href="">20:34</a>

lighting boots ah yes

The sonic drowning music is so intense

R.i.p guide we&#39;ll never forget you

I hate u so bad BRUh why u insult Connor when he sacrificed himself to let you pass to hardmode and finish the game

When your name is Connor 😭😭😭😭

Man blew up the biggest vein of platinum I&#39;ve seen in my entire life lmao.

so i watched episode 4 got confused so espidoe 4 was 3 3 was 4 to it like this 1 2 4 3 5

The title made me laugh. Boi I killed the wall on my first try in 1 minute and 34 seconds

this guy looking at crafting recipes is like watching bob ross

You can get the broken hero sword by going into a solar eclipse you can summon it by go ing into a jungle temple you can go into it if you defeated the plantera

Mans got mage armour with the muramasa and Phoenix blaster

PewDiePie u know that there is the mech bosses all the way to moonlord right

Your so dumb the wall of flesh is not the hardest boss after wall of flesh is twins destroyer and skeletron prime

Pews I beat the hardest boss. All the veterans that beat moon lord in 15 sec be like. (;-;)

He just died like now😂😂😂
“I beat the hardest boss”Duke fishron: Am I a joke to you?

Why mr beast has much much more viewers than pewdiepie

Wow... I haven’t seen a normal mode playthrough in forever. I went expert, then master mode. Never looked back. It looks so easy... like, the queen bee just went down like that!

That&#39;s not the hardest boss 🤣

He&#39;s swearing 🤬
A flare gun doesn’t do anything

Pewds: &#39;now its time to die.......... which I never do&#39;me: &#39;Really?&#39;

Pewds: “I feel like I’ve done everything”Vetarens: Have you beaten it in Expert mode didnt think so

You dont have pets that fights for you

you need kill the wall of flesh to even more enimes mech bosses rich to kill plantera to get broken hero sword

me first watching him play terraria: <b>pathetic</b>me when i see him beat WOF on first try when it took me 6 years: <b>he is the chosen one he will bring balance.</b>

at about 2 thirds in, I wonder if anyone will be watching this on Xmas day after eating Sprouts, beans &amp; Cabbage, no to mention ...

&gt; is not using any magic weapons&gt; is using muramasa and phoenix blaster as &quot;main weapons&quot;&gt; should probably be wearing either shadow armor or necro armor&gt; is wearing an incomplete set of meteor armor anyway

W

It&#39;s been exactly one year since this damn...

The hardest boss is the the twins Empress of light moon lord And skeleton prime

For me, queen bee does 3 damage to me but the hive I had was almost all honey so I had to build platforms mid fight

this is so fucking POGG, ilove teraria i have like 300 houres on it

Bruh it’s been 5 episodes and he already has way better stuff then me, I know this was 10 months ago but all I’m saying is that he started way better then I did lmao💀.

&quot;i beat the hardest boss on the first try&quot;moon lord and empress of light: <b><i>hardest?</i></b>

&quot;Wall of flesh is the last boss&quot;Every terraria veteran ever: Well, yes, but actually no.

Actually wall of flesh is not the 1.3.5 hardest boss

umm i defeated wall of flesh on my first try using beenades

&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;* laughs in light empress *

&quot;I beat the HARDEST Boss&quot;Every hardmode boss, especially Moonlord: Are we a joke to you?

if you listen close he says cheezus instead of jesus

NOOO CONNOR!

You should get the bee armor and the bee gun with the bee staff. Really cool and is good if you have infinite mana. It will DESTROY the king slime and weaker bosses

Now I watch this series to see pewdiepie teach me how to play terraria

Moreeeeee

!!!!!!!!!!

Nice

He needs to meet dungeon guardian which in my opinion is harder then moon lord cuz if your using celestial armor and for me beating him took me four in game days to kill him

Terraria Veterans: Laughs in Moon Lord

Pewdiepie fist part: <b>kills rabbit</b> I’m so sorry, I won’t do it again!Pewdiepie now: <b>LITERALLY SHOOTS A RABBIT WITH FIRE GUN</b>
Is it me or does the Phoenix blaster look like killer beans pistols?

The wall of flesh is the easiest boss in terraria

Press u d-head u r such an idiot u needed to mine the honey to find bee

Pewds: &quot;WOAH THATS FUCK*NGMASSIVE DUDE WOAH!!&quot;Zenith: &#39;¿_&#39;

Conor is ninja,s brother i guess

You need lava charm to easily get hell stone

the wall of flash is a easy boss and have the hardmode bosses

He did not realize he would have an ank sheild, soonThe beaozour,, uhhhAnd the cobalt and obsidian shield

As a veteran terraria player, pewd’s lets play is kinda infuriating haha

pewdiepie: i beat the hardest boss on the first try master mode moon lord: stop the cap

I wish that Felix could do a Minecraft and Terraria speedrun. Like if you want that to happen

i&#39;m unsubscribing cus after the stream u have to be member if u missed it

This game is so cool

Well, on normal everything is easy. I strongly recommend to play on expert mode. A lot of fun!PS. when you are masochist

Conner is levi now??

What class u felix Felix :Whut ez class?

Everytime pewds die he just go to conner&#39;s room and starts to bully him

when he put the cursor on &#39;&#39;conner&#39;&#39; the guide&#39;s name was levi

I&#39;m surprised he thought wall of flesh was the hardest

God that title was cringe

When he beats the hardest boss - the ogsFacepalm

moonlord is crying:(

ah yes, hardest boss
Where is Connor and WHO is Levi?

Terraria is a good game but it’s not better than minecraft

OK then kill the moon lord

So the dungeon guardian Wall of flesh it pains my very soul for you to say that what all flesh is if you&#39;re prepared easy if you&#39;re in hard mode he&#39;s easy if you&#39;re an end-game character he&#39;s a slime

Pewds: Let&#39;s find queen bee <b>Destroys honey</b> Skips*Me: 0.0 THATS WHERE THE QUEEN BEE IS!

“Just crafted in the water “ bruh noice EngLiosh

uwu good idea.and the nurse is ula brita idk who sven or jeorgan is.

i like how he doesnt care about classes

“The hardest boss” is not wall of flesh. He just got bored of the series

“This is dynamite, it go boom boom”<b>*dies*</b>

no the hardest is actually the moonlord

“What’s an anglet?”People who grew up with phineas and ferb:
