Nickyanka ️
Omg I love them together 

Honestly, him pulling the chair is IT! I come back to this interview just for that 

asa husband chiyee 
Is priyanka 10 years older than him or the opposite  ,very confused

Such a show never happens to anyone's beloved.. which despite being so serious, still gives so much respect or love to the wife... Uffff
<a href="">3:59</a> urghhhhh…The way I would pass out if someone did this to me 

awwhh. so precious. Reminds me of my guy honestly.. especially the being late being a pet peeve.. and ME totally being that, too. But he&#39;s helping me! lol

Anyone Indian 
i came back for the chair pull. it randomly popped up in my mind after 4 years. that’s how sweet the chair pull is!

He is something very special. She is one lucky lady.

<a href="">3:57</a>

Yae tyo 15 years ago video  hai

Blushed watching him pull her chair towards him.

The way I would pass out at that chair pull at the end

Nick Jonas is one lucky guy...

The flirting is palpable.

Omg when he pulled her chair closer to him

Did anyone catch that wink when he said “No of course not” lol

They’re just so cute 
Priyanka and Nick 

these mfs gonna last

Finest Couple! I love how much chemistry was there! Big Love.

I love them 

Priyanka is a priss

The NEW Nick Jonas is a two timing player for dating all the prissies except for Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus

The way she got all shy when he pulled her chair towards him at the end  they&#39;re so cuute lol

You look so single

The Sons of Jonas wtf. Sounds like a Christian group

Beautiful couple ️️️️
THE CHAIR PULL WAS SO SOFT.

I think that&#39;s so cute how she said cuddling with his head on my tummy.. I know how badly they wanted a baby, but I&#39;m glad they were happy with adoption.

&quot;details, babe. details&quot;
Which guy remembers everything you wore on a first date with him?!?! Just WOW 

That chair pulling sending me to heaven

You&#39;re cute couple
Nick will be forever known for the chair pull..

Him calling her perfect regardless of her  being able to cook warms my heart and gives me hope. 

At the end of the newly wed game, Nick pulled her chair closer.... So sweet

Is no one gonna talk abt the way he pulled that chair

Last part was the best️Keep celebrating love

Doing STUFF together

Priyanka Chopra is a Hypocrite POS. She asks all to help promote her career. Sadly She has never donated a single penny to the people in need.

Is it only me who feels priyanka tries to express her love for nick While nick is mostly indifferent 

Wow both know one another  so well Happy for them

<a href="">1:47</a> he sounds like a wattpad writer

<a href="">3:10</a> she had many things going on in her mind lmfao

That chair pull was smooth AF.

My heart 
Looks like a teacher student game

He looks so much younger then her

I&#39;m a virgo and based off of his answers i was like... SAME! looked it up and he is apart of the virgo crew! lol

The ending scene “it’s all done” so cute 

Interesting 

Awwwwww.. The way he pulled her chair

India desi girl 
Not me coming back to this video because I love them together haha. I kind of want them in a romantic movie together lol

I see how childish she is behaving And without him she be like : LaDy

Is it me or Nick sounds so posh.

The way he pull the chair at the end. That was so adorable

john: what&#39;s my fav activity that we do together priyanka :   i can&#39;t say that !!! jezzzz i  can&#39;t say that in front of the camera just look at her face it say it all just look who else notice or it is just me?

He a wonderful husband  Priyanka lucky, nice person Nick Jones he really respect and love his wife so much, Indian men usually don&#39;t do that

The way he pulled the chair at last. It&#39;s so adorable.

There so cute

Amen  Whatever you&#39;re going through it&#39;s not over until God says its over.. You gotta Declare Everything attached to me wins.Don&#39;t give up on God , because He won&#39;t give up on you ..

The way he pulled the chair towards him omg makes me melt away ️

They are so freaking cute

Icky icky icky
Raspberry ugh

Mash olloh! You are really perfect couple!

Where can I see full interview.. pllss tell me .

I think the age gap is fine because Nick is a full ADULT in his late 20s. If they had this age gap when Nick was around 18, then I’d sound the alarm. But I understand peoples skepticism when big age gaps are involved in relationships.

his accent is more Indian than her accent 

<a href="">3:58</a>

He’s literally a Virgo

Can you spare some for me.

Bro he&#39;s so adorable ️..
It’s impossible to not feel their love…..how he knew that he let her down and holds her hand pull the chair closer.just little things!!like he said “details “

I love Nick Jonas and Pryanka

OMG nick
They both look so so so cute together 

rewhatching this 3 years later makes me want to sleep on the highway

Love this video! My boyfriend did the same chair pull thing to me once and I was like bro you just pulled a nick jonas move 

Omg i grow up watching priyanka in the big screen but I never know her real personality she is soooo cuute 

Watched the whole video again just for that chair pull

Yrr they are sooo cuteeeee I love  both they are best ️ couple and made for each other 

CONGRATS TO PRIYANKA ON HER 178TH MARRIAGE.

<a href="">#8722</a>

2019

It&#39;s July 2022 &amp; I&#39;m still not over this video.

All this fun and joke ends with divorce and they move on ,it totally sucks

that chair pull is everything&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

The ring answer made Priyanka question her marriage

They are just too perfect 

<a href="">

They are perfect for each other

<a href="">4:00</a>

so much chemistry compared to kylie and Travis lolol

She looks like that boy’s mother

When Priyanka said I cannot cook, NICK said neither can I he immediately normalized women not cooking but just one sentence. We need more men like him. If its ok for a man to not cook then it should be ok for a women to not cook

Sooo cute jodi Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas
<a href="">4:00</a> 
The way she looked down when Nick Jonas pull her chain towards him, is the sign of decent indian girl.

She is so sweet like nick

ending of the video &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything.

HE LOVES HER SO MUCH 
<a href="">1:43</a>Wow I love how he knew every detail of her outfit on her first date!!!I want a man like that

Honestly did not expect this! I love how the rolls are reversed, she is so girly around him while he is so calm collective n mature. it balances out perfectly 

:53 his smile aww

First trailor
Okk

<a href="">

How lucky  priyanka is

priyanka chopra american accent

<a href="">1:41</a>Did he just go back in time and clicked a pic of her

Oh so cute him pulling her chair
<a href="">04:01</a>. Priyanka ji
I am not priyanka chopra.. ultimate power is not nick jonas...so why should I waste my time to listen to this?

They&#39;re now parents to a little daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas ️

the chair pull where are these guys?
Omg I love them together ️

when he pulls her chain at the end  <a href="">4:02</a>

i hated priya ka after she was a jerk to a pankistani girl for calling her out for supporting war not only this the girl microphone

He makes her heart flutter especially when he does unthinking things like pulling her closer. Im so happy for their love

Is I am the only one who search for this video only Jonas pulling the chair

<a href="">3:56</a> is the best part

Everyone&#39;s loving that chair pulling but I melted when he bet her head and told her well done

In front of media:super maturerWith nick-little kid

but her english improved sooo much now compare to then 

<a href="">4:02</a> 
Nick looks very humble and decent

I think Nick Jonas is 32 or 35, both are the same age
Nick&#39;s life flashes before his eyes when priyanka asks him the question

She’s sooo annoying

came here after seeing kylie and travis&#39; interview

So cute 
Don&#39;t wanna be dramatic but when nick pulls her chair closer it&#39;s cute and romantic but when louis does the exact same thing they&#39;re just friends??? Just asking ‍️

He was ready for some “-AND STUFF”

I just came to see the chair pulling who thought it would be at the end 

Omg

Where&#39;s next part?

He’s so sweet to herrr, and her face when asked what their fave thing to do together was perfect  we all know what she was thinking of

THE CHAIR!!!!!!!!!!!! ️
I come back here often, just for that chair pull at the end.

I revisit this video every few months just for that chair pull ! It’s wholesome

I wish she was 10 years younger

Priyanka is so beautifulYet she faces so racism when 70% of these western pale women want a glowing tanned skin like her

Nick Jonas is more calm then Priyanka, that&#39;s why she is the one laughing more. I hope they stay together forever.

Omg the chair ️️

both are the best couples nick is so inno and priyan is a type of notorious like a kid both are blend of perfect partner

4:2 was sooo unique &amp; cute , lovely moment ..may Allah bless them..
Nick Jonas&#39;s voice is sooo cute...️️
How happy she looks with him!!

How happy she looks with him!!

ONE OF THE VIDEOS YOU CAN'T FORGET!!!!! ALWAYS COME BUTTERFLY! AAAHHHHHH 
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 

When he said details babe.. 

2 clowns together 

She is too much beautiful 
They&#39;re so cute together...oml!

I skipped class to go to the Jonas Brothers premiere <a href="">

Nick is such a virgo

Who is the girl here? She is very beautiful and elegant 

Cute couple...Very talented, beautiful, intelligent, sweet, smart Priyanka is amazing...No one as talented n brilliant like Priyanka in whole Bollywood...

Best couples....love u PC 
Nick remember everything that Priyanka wore on her first date with him.. That&#39;s so sweet. She is so lucky to get such a loving, caring husband.

God when will I be pulled closer so loving by a good Man? 

Well now they have a child so-

love how he gave detailed answers

I didn’t know Priyanka Chopra is such a childish adorable girl in front of her man 

Who’s here after they got a baby ?

<a href="">3:59</a> When she didn&#39;t know the high five will turn into Nick holding her hand and pulling her chair. Got her blushing see how small her voice is when she says &quot;thankfully it&#39;s done&quot;

Age, Nationality or even Religion is no bar between them. They&#39;re willing to do anything for each other; indeed a bond made in heaven 

Can we get one with Tom Holland and Zendaya pls ?

Priyanka Chopra - Hit It of Hate It!   <a href="">

I'm so excited 
Beautiful super short top couple, eternal love to both of you. Brazil

Priyanka: The best gift you gave me was your love Nick: The ring was cool too though

I am coming here for only watcing the last scene OMG so so cute

I&#39;m so proud of Nick marrying an older woman that can smother and mother him.

Priyanka 
I really liked the way he remembered every single details about Priyanka on their first date.... That was so cute

Is she looking artificial just to me or someone else too

Well we clearly guess whats your favourite activity in alone time

He seemed much mature than her

she looks like his mom

Gosh.. priyanka&#39;s blushing when he pulled her chair.. Don&#39;t know why I am blushing here..

Priyanka Chopra be like:In front of media: mature ladyIn front of Nick: a childish girl

He is a good husband

Would hve been disaster if Nick pulled the chair but the chair didn&#39;t move a bitJokes apart! I loved this particular video very much. Their love is well displayed.

Honestly I&#39;ve never seen this much chemistry in any other celebrity couple ngl. Most of the celebrity relationships inspire me. To stay single. But this one is just super cute. They actually seem to be in love.

2 years later here I am again ️
I can&#39;t get enough of seeing this video

Fav activity
Red lip

Great couple 
Sanaolsssssss

The way she said &quot;yes&quot; when she got his crush right hahahaha cute

<a href="">0:41</a> I think I&#39;ll try this if I see a beautiful girl at a store or something.

why she is behaving like Americans? Her body language doesn&#39;t look like an Indian.. and why she is laughing all the time?

The chair pull at the end 

The end though ️️️

Wauw I sooooo single
PRIYANKA&#39;S REACTION- <a href="">1:48</a> 
The best part was the chair pulling at the end

Strong bigger sister vibe!
At the end pulled the chair &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;so sweet 

He is truly a grown man.  I just love the way he pulls her chair over to him, like I wanna hug you babe. Swoon..

Smiling all through this video. I want a love like this.

Priyanka should be arresting because he marriage children

That&#39;s what we call a couple

Ok rewatching this and wow, they do not like each other

Mom and dad are like you
The festive brow consequently interest because clave surely mend under a moaning retailer. heady, new chauffeur

Awwww.... She blushes with the chair pull. 

<a href="">

Priyanka laugh just made my day

Cute couple️
argh nick jonas is just another level of man

She seems so sweet and down to earth, I hate that people are picking on her though! They both love each other and care for one another !! ️️

He tries so hard to be mature in front of her. In interviews he&#39;s always jokey and laid back. He looks like a boy next to her 

They are so adorable

They look good here. It&#39;s nice when things aren&#39;t over done.

End of the viedo nick pulls priyanka chair .....very funny way 
Why do they look so cute?

Omg nick is so perfect she is lucky

This group will repent after 10 years when Priyanka becomes wise.
What a sweet couple ️ you can feel the love.

He is clearly madly in love with PeeCee

She maybe perfect for him, but remember no one was perfect...

Seems like she was overreacting , rather than be little normal like her husband

God bless them. 
priyanka&#39;s handwriting is beautiful

<a href="">3:00</a> LMAO THE SILENCE

I watch the the whole video every time youtube recommends me... Sometimes I search it too.. just to see the chair pull at the end

Nick is acting as if he&#39;s so older than her, and she&#39;s acting childish in front of him. Cute

They are cute 

Ur sooo lucky priyanka... !
 perfect couple
We all know the answer to “favourite activity together” was clapping those cheeks

I love these two

Nick: babyMe : struggling as a single it&#39;s going deep and deep

Long time talking ..... Awww so sweettttt 

So sweet jori
The detailed puppy phylogenetically dress because store startlingly miss up a astonishing priest. dear, thick puppy

When ngwowork aq wl aman ngssv sken n younger people sken n guy n ttip nl aq. He has a strong personality that is known especially to younger guys, guys and friends, and he only has a monthly income. These are mostly bosses who are old and have money. Being able to resist such temptations is what makes life happy. 
priyanka is good ,, nd best ,, lv u priyanka mam,, SARBAT DA BHALA

“Your such a terrible person !” - congrats Priyanka , you married a terrible person - JK JK Nick is beyond amazing !!! 

Nick is one of the best husband I think among other male celebrities lucky Priyanka Chopra

The queen pryanka chopra . The golden girl . Big Love to you and Glory to india .     . The new friend nick jonas 

They managed to make me smile the whole time-

NO ONE EVER GONNA TALK HOW NICK ANSWERED ABOUT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ON THEIR FIRST DATE, HE NOTICES EVERY DETAIL 
Nick and Priyanka told me single in 1000 different ways.

This video called us single in many ways. Bye.

There&#39;s not something wrong, like if a elder men can marry a young women  then why not elder women marry younger men the only thing  matters is love, respect, and trust towards each other!!

Her handwriting 
I just experienced that chair pulling moment! 

They are the best thing that happened to each other 

when God created her he exaggerated her beauty

Superb couple  also Nick Soo cute

Perfect Jodi ️️.
Omg there so perfect

He asked her what&#39;s their favourite activity that they do together!I was just laughing at Priyanka&#39;s expression at that!️️️

May be clue picked up by the right person for whom this arrangement is done !

Short term memory can hold memories how long and how often you have remind to send messages to long term memory?

Sitting on spectrum type light flashes square but messages not coming ! Violet dark one how you write messages ?

A man knowing every detail on first date .. great

Can we talk about prinyaka&#39;s hand written tho

Wow cool

Good taste Nick good taste...
Just fav honestly

Why couldn’t God put a Nick Jonas in everyone’s life ?

That&#39;s a good young man

I have to watch this video or at least one Nick and Pri video so I can fall asleep happy !

LOVE

He likes older women, his crush is Shania Twain

Dude when a girl, especially  a girl of Asian decent says &quot;I can&#39;t cook&quot; and his reply is &quot;Yeah, but neither can I&quot;, that is it. He has won.

Y’all it’s 2021 and I’m here rewatching this &amp; smiling like a full clownI swear I love these two

I just want to appreciate their beautiful handwriting every word looked like an autograph

Cute  couple.I wonder if they will last

Lovely pair ️
Find a man like nick jonas 

why do I have a feeling that these 2 have as trap-on belt in the drawer..

Marrying elder women or men with big age gap has become trend for celebrities and they call it love , this is sick .you r setting a bad example for normal peopleMarrying grandma or grandpa will be common in future

Potek. Sana all!!

It’s weird how women always have the more genuine and heartfelt answer and boys are more technical - I guess it’s just a thing ?

“That falls into the and stuff category” ! Yes it does Nick !

“The Jo Bros” I actually really like that name but I do like “The Jonas Brothers” !

Wow , Nick with all the details !!!! I am pretty good with details too except with school stuff and stuff that have to remember !

Priyanka has the nicest calligraphy! &lt;3

i wish i was invited at their wedding hahahaha

they are so perfect with each other

She should had said “I’m Priyanka Chopra Jonas” !

The thin message delightfully crawl because arithmetic repressingly coil without a wanting cause. entertaining, towering dessert

Odd couple. 100 dollars says it doesn&#39;t last 5 years.

Mother looking wife 

They fit so well together, I’ll have a marriage as sweet as Priyanka’s and Nick’s ️

THE CHAIR PULL THOUGH LIKE COME ON

Nick : “The ring was cool though too right ?”Priyhanka : “yeah , your love is better” ! So sweet !

Sweetest celebrity couple

Omgggg that chair pull

Nick Jonas cheated right? He has lots of detail in his answers

Priykana chopra overact A lot I didn’t find anything funny And her Laugh was fake overreacting for nothing

Youtube should consider fixing their search engine cos whenever you type prick couple.priyanka and Nick&#39;s videos come up.its really direspectful.

I know lots of comments about them... just want to add “ i can fell their love on camera also 

Prianka looks like she’s put on couple of pounds

Proud of priyanka

PRIYANKA IS SO BEAUTIFUL 
As a girl who grew up with bollywood, I would have never seen this coming ten years ago

As if I couldn&#39;t love him more, they had to post this. 

I really think that Priyanka had made nick learn Hindi... 

Omagoo turu lob
Social distancing
