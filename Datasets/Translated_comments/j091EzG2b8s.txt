Title fix: 2018*

<a href="">5:40</a> It&#39;s Gareena Not Gairana bruh 😂😂Btw it was a popular game in india, almost every teenager watches it. That&#39;s why.

Who is this girl saying &quot;that is so awkward to watch&quot;?

F

Who knew Will Smith was an a$$?

<a href="">4:33</a> burp

Still bothers me how they didn&#39;t really add pewdiepie into the rewind. Although he&#39;s there, it&#39;s just him and his wedding video and not like the other rewinds where you had actual airtime to do actual stuff

pewdiepie has 28,485,705,245views, so theres a reason why hes in rewind

PewDiePie always beats tseries in consistency he has more views less videos and actual fucking content

F

F

It makes me so happy to see that pewdiepies wedding video was in top 3

What is this song?

&quot;Will be interesting to see what they do next year&quot;Interesting indeed

Pewds went from 4 billion to 28 billion views in 2 years, dayum!

My favourite part is when I saw you and Mr beast.

Who else thought it was just a preview?

Hey pew no pain no gain
Atta halilintarrrrr
What 111M subscribe

<a href="">5:39</a> i laugh in here lmao😂

<a href="">12:24</a> this little weasel sank like a heavy shit.

i think that rewind had less engagement with the comunities

At this point the best part about the youtube rewind would be the fanny pack...

I'm so glad Epep wasn't considered
Where is the clip of your brother cursing Fifi? Please give me the link.
The real reason why youtube remove dislike button? 🗿

tomorrow, this will turn 2 years old.

<a href="">5:40</a> my favorite part 🤣
GIVE FANNY PACK

Ep ep buriq!!!!
Use me like you would use dislike buttons

return youtube dislike (dot) (c) (o) (m)Don&#39;t get used to it. Fight back!

Idk who creating YouTube rewind 2021 but I don&#39;t need rewind from YouTube because YouTube sucks. 😡

I really hate you. You stole from me. Curse and yet shall be cursed. Meaning you will not enjoy our reward as king and queen of heaven. I will not walk in Heaven now. I will be your friends even. I hate you.

Akwowkoaakqkk game burik dikatain plagiat

Felix Kjelberg ! Jesus calls you! People will cling to sin, yet it is killing them eternally. Sin is murderous, the biggest killer! Have you ever lied before? Stolen Before? Blasphemed God&#39;s name? (Would you say your mothers name in place of a curse word if you stubbed your toe  so why would you say the name of the God in vain Who gave you life?) Hvae you ever looked with lust? all lof it is Going to be judged on Jydgement day by The Holy God who  gave us life and will spearate us from Himself, because He is everything good, and so we&#39;re left with everything bad, that is fire, and hell. Now Jesus died for your sin, so that if you believe in Him , you will live in Heaven eternally,  with Him. Turn from sin, because it would lead to hell. Turn to christ, he can save you!

Hi

The very fact that that PewDiePie doesn’t know some of these top videos/channels (and I certainly don’t either) signals that rewind as the original concept doesn’t work any more. YouTube is too big and fragmented it’s impossible to distill the year into a single rewind compilation. The top channels have their own separate audiences. There is no recap of the year that will satisfy everyone.

F

<a href="">7:04</a> by landslide too lmao

It's true, my friends, I think so. Fifi is trash.
<a href="">5:40</a> If anyone wants to see that Pew is telling the truth. You can press for thailand. Eep. It's loud. Haha. But it can't compete with wotb. Haha.
What do you mean, I'm Korean. Let’s preserve the three thousand miles of Rose of Sharon, Hwanghwagangsan Mountain, and the people of Daehan.

Pewdiepie has the idea of &quot;even pewdiepie just barely fix the hate&quot; in his mind during the making of this video.

Pewdiepie made Minecraft popular again.

They need to do memes and loss of people and bang song and queens and Kings song

I would like to say that this man has a mic on his headphones and uses a microphone

<a href="">2:15</a>

You should do a FreeFire gameplay

FHelp

1.2 million likes and <b>19k</b> dislikes wtf how does this have 19k dislikes

They should just give pewds, flying kitty, dolan dark and granday the rights to rewind

F

Your really funny

<a href="">6:01</a>Among us: Im about to ruin this game whole career

f

Can we rewind 2020
Do something comedic so we will like

In rewind 2020 to be specific

The greatest wish on the pewds rewindRaining dollars with all the people party Plz

why the f you skip the whole vid

Felix :pointing out that the tittle is make this the most liked video on YouTube Also Felix: I’m not being salty for not being number one

f

He just skipped part t series lol

When pewds has more subs that youtube it selfs

Pewds should understand that we don’t like to watch him because he doing an amazing video it’s just his personality that everybody likes

<a href="">6:02</a>, i love this part

<a href="">5:40</a>, to FF players from Indonesia
Idk i kinda like the 2019rewind

Bruh a clone of me made it in but I didn&#39;t <a href="">9:30</a>

there should be a rewind of the whole decade, imagine the memories that&#39;d bring

shallow

Covid could make YouTube rewind 2020 an absolute bomb, showing how united we were, how we overcame quarantine, showing people that remained positive and made our quarantine days a little bit better, how were dozens of youtubers informing people about covid, how was hospital staff working tiredlessly for so long, showing that youtube isn&#39;t just a waste of time, but that there are educational and informative videos as well... but I think youtube will remain political and F it up like it always does

How did Noah Schnapps become Drew Gordon?

What would they put &quot;good&quot; in youtube rewind 2020

They need to let mr beast host the next one

F

lol felix called noah schapp drew gooden
SO GUYS WE DID IT

SHLANG

Anime rewind 2020

Felix: has a viewer demographic of primarily 18-24 year olds, secondarily of 25-34 year oldsalso Felix: makes a poop game

can&#39;t wait for youtube rewind 2020

This year is just going to be a 10 hour livestream of the inside of a nuclear reactor, tossing cameras in for 10 straight hours

F

2020 Rewind should just be a 10-hour clip of a dumpster fire.

<a href="">2:35</a>

People do not like your videos. People like you Felix. I was lingering between hating you and liking you in the past few years, but...I think that you are an awesome person, who made some mistakes. You got this without me, but I give chu my wimpy support (as in a resub)

Now I’m really wondering what it will be for 2020 since the pandemic

Pewdiepie said it fortnite is “lame”

Yes your videos on not good🤬🤬🤬 I not love beauty Pi
F

Fool ff listen
<a href="">5:38</a> epic moment

Me watching this in 2020 thinking about how crazy Rewind 2020 will be

Can’t wait for 2020 rewind-

Its been 10 months and I&#39;m still a bit salty that they put &quot;top 5 games&quot; instead of &quot;top 5 gamERS&quot; as if gamers arent some of the most influential pillars of this website

Think about the 2020 YouTube rewind will be like.

why dont they talk about the youtubers not the top 10 shit

Does anyone know the background music

This year among us will be on the game list😁

50% of 2020 rewind is just coffin dance meme isn&#39;t it

<a href="">8:47</a>

I don&#39;t really think that youtube rewind can just CHANGE to the way it used to beYoutube itself is now very different from what it used to beAnd each year&#39;s Youtube Rewind is kinda a reflection of what Youtube focuses on as a platform.Since youtube is becoming more and more a corporate, I can&#39;t really see how Youtube rewind can go back to the &quot;good old days&quot;

This one wasnt bad

2020 is already fked up and i kept wondering what would they do this year

Preparing my downvote for YouTube&#39;s 2020 Rewind, and my upvote for Felix&#39;s.

There is no wwe thats why yt rewinds gets dislike..!!!

Pewdiepie literally saw in the future lmao <a href="">13:32</a>

<a href="">6:56</a> well... sit down ma boy i need to tell you something

What are you doing this year?

Faze rug is middle eastern and he already had 10 million subs so how does that work?

Mr beast gets more views then piediepie but I like both lol 😂

entitled parents

F

Why don&#39;t you try NOT to make it good. Keep the cringe.

next year rewind, if they have the guts to try and make one, wold be all youtubers in a space station killing each other and ejecting non impostors until the winners (top creators this year) remain. either as crewmates or impostors

I just LOVE the fact that they felt they need to ask pewds his opinion on the matter. so ironic. so perfect. its like balance is finally restored.

there is no rewind  in 8907

Little did pewds know after 6 days of release of this video we were gonna experience a pandemic

what youtube should do for the next rewind, just a thought, is ranking the best to worst youtube rewind😂

can&#39;t wait for this year

eminem
He called it Kurtsegat i&#39;m triggered /s

I feel kinda badAt this point i think whatever yt makes everyone will hate it

song name please

I pretty shure this &quot;new format&quot; is the new norm this year...

YOUTUBE GODS MY DREAM IS 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERi cant breath with my nose because my nose is broken😭😭i swear i am not lyng🥺

This feels the like the Rewind youtube would have to make in 2020 because of quarantine

One of these days the sun will shine upon Youtube and they’ll just ask Felix to create YouTube Rewind 🤣

I want to see the 2020 youtube rewind

F

He committed suicide cause keem star told him it&#39;s fine if he did

Joyconmen

Little did he know minecraft....

f

F... Pewds made me do it.
this year we have last of us part 2 and their shit drama (this game actually good by the way, no hates), ghost os tsushima, fall guy, among us, pretty much year of gaming i think

Me beast Did it

f

what if 2020 youtube rewind would include pewds and the video would start of with pewds shouting &quot;FLOOR GANG OUH FLOOR GANG OUH!&quot;P.S: stay at home guys

What I want for Rewind 2020:- Decade Review- David Blaine Ascension- Among Us- Pewds wearing Watermelon helmetOther than that, I want to see the big stuff that happened this year. Without going political of course, because I can&#39;t find any good reason to bury the past and hide from our future. That&#39;s what Rewind should be about. When we&#39;re all wearing diapers again, we can look back to our younger daysthrough a Rewind. They should start it with saying &quot;2020 was a rough year&quot;.

I think Pewds 2018 rewind is the best of all rewinds so far.

I mean Pewdiepie number 1
When they say 2018 was bad well you thought wrong buddy.

<a href="">5:36</a> org indo sini:V
2020 rewind is probably going to be one of those &quot;it was a hard year, but people did something so we have entertain.&quot; But for some reason I always just cringe hard at those kind of things.

Pewdiepie: I have 4 billion views...jeez 9 months later : 26 billion 😑

f

Now there’s the best part of 2020A even worst rewind

F

second life

How did watch mojo make a better rewind than YouTubes watch mojo rewind!?!

owo

2020 needs:Creators: dream, pewds, dolan dark, flying kitty, granday, Meaty Marley, Unus Annus (bad side: Logan Paul and a few others)Topics: trending music, games, and memes as well as, deaths, breakups, BLM, COVID 19Music: Never gonna give you up, Billie Eylish or however you spell it, and a few othersThey also need to give hope and recognition to people who struggled through the rough year.

2020 Rewind. Insanely rich, well-off, out of touch celebrities telling us we&#39;re going to make it through this together, and to not give up hope.

pewds is secretly rich because 1 mil views=$5,000

Where you sayWhat is this game?Garena FreefireGem burik
