Jackie Shroff and Rishi Kapoor have starred together in films like Azaad Desh Ke Gulam (1990), Aurangzeb (2013), and Chalk n Duster (2016), but unfortunately, they never got a chance to share screen space with each other.Recently, while talking to a daily, Jackie Shroff revealed how Rishi Kapoor and he wanted to share screen space in a film and this is a wish that will never come true now. Shroff said, “Chintuji always used to tell me, ‘Jaggu dada, I want to do a film opposite you. We’ve worked together in so many movies but never faced each other on camera.’ Him being a senior to me and one of the finest actors of the industry, I so wanted to act with him. I feel sad that this wish never will come true now. We’ve lost a precious jewel of the crown.”Remembering his first meeting with Rishi Kapoor, Jackie Shroff said, “I remember his film Bobby (1973) had released and he shot to fame overnight. I was hanging around the Pastry Palace in Mumbai and I saw him there for the first time. I was like, ‘Wao, Rishi Kapoor!’ I wasn’t an actor then and seeing a superstar was like a fan moment to me and I never knew that one day, we would share such great camaraderie.”The Ram Lakhan actor also revealed that they used to call each other and discuss Tiger Shroff’s performance. He said, “He would meet people with a big warm hug and was so jovial and always sharing good vibes. I could always feel that affection from a senior not just for myself but for Tiger as well. We would ring up and discuss Tiger’s performance in his recent movies. Coming from him really meant a lot to me.”
