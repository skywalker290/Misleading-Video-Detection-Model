Huawei P30 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S10?
p30 in 2023

This Phone Huawei P30 Pro Transfer From The TV Zootopia Plus

Gonna be 4 years with that crazy phone. P30 Pro forever 

No, the galaxy s10 is full of trouble. Prefer the p30 pro with the upgraded s10

Hi how much cost 256 gb please

3 years later.. i am using mate 20 pro and p30 pro... same specs like this 1...beast of a phone both...

And from there on, the united states went full damage control

2022 someone ?

You know what the best phone in the world would be ?A phone that is made by the collaboration of Apple ,Huawei  and Samsung. That would be insanely awesome 

this phone is still a monster

You mean s20+?

Samsung and Apple are defiantly in big Trouble.

I prefer Huawei

I want that phone

&quot;The P Stands for Photography&quot;Me:<b>Pee</b>

Still using this in march 2021. Best phone ever!

great phone but brightness levels such and are very forced to lower brightness.  once you have it set to the brioghter levels samsung phones are set too the battery length becomes simular.    my problem is that auto brightness turns back on eevery time you restart the phone.  i turned it off for a reason, the reason being its too dull for me otherwise.  so plse p30 pro stay off when i have spend the time to turn you off in settings.  its a big issue with this p30 pro.  my only wish is that samsung remove the bixby button so i can buy samsunt, at a cheaper prioce but bi=xby long press= bixby voice = no disable feature for that, hense the p30 pro.  p30 pro great phone but it has issues.  bad sound, 1 speaker, a auto chaRGE FEATURE THAT MOSTLY STOPS CHARGEING AT STUPID TIMES AND A BRIGHTNESS LEVEL HAWAWI SEEMS INTENT OF FORCEING YOU TO USE EVEN IF YOU DISABLE THE AUTO FEATURE.    shame.  Everything else is good to great but its not perfect.

This is way better then samsung but just not stereo speakers

Huawei licks apple  hands down
The torpid knight oppositely disagree because packet consecutively trick of a  fixed cappelletti. reminiscent, gaping kettle

The camera on this phone is so beautiful and clear

Huawei has faster and better  machine than samsung

trump losehuawei : google yeah

The fact there is a big controversy with the US Government and Huawei was actually part of the appeal of it for me. That and the camera.

Who is better now huh iphone or Android!!?!!

i have an iphone, and i’ll wait until this one gets fucked so i can buy this one  like why r iphones 1,5k dollars like what the fuck did they smoke?

The price was 1000 euros to start but I can get it for 480 today in the Netherlands.

This is a amazing phone even in 2020....

Everytime the beard test in the videos ist one of the best things to see, even in the current videos

Stolen ideas and design from Samsung... Way to go Huawei

Yap Huawei make phones thats why Apple always leaves in worry

Watching on my p30 pro :)

Is it still worthy to buy Huawei p30 Pro in September 2020?

I had a iPhone a year ago and a year later I changed it to a huawei p30 lite because my phone 7 barley working and I got it from the apple store im not spoiled but I gave the iPhone 7 to my brother and he&#39;s happy so....

Does it have Google services

Huawei is spying you

I&#39;m pretty sure I love this p30, I&#39;m watching this video in 2020...but I love it surely this p30 but I cant afford to buy it... sad reality I can&#39;t afford but I love watching this video

When i take a pic in huwaei at night. I got a pic of daytime. How can i take a night pic???

It is said that Huawei has actually beaten apple, and now they want to fight samsung.Good it hasn&#39;t been banned in my country! So I can still make my choice

The Camera is so bad all these years and still no good software to back up the specs..its pathetic

I just got my Huawei P30 Pro.Had to pay off my P20

after uppdate today i  cant choose 40 camera? only 4:3 1:1 or full screen? someone else?

Hey @UnboxTherapy, this or Samsung S20?

it would still kill today if it had 90 hrtz display

how to change volume on notification ?.....please help

disappointed with huawei p30 pro, after months of using it won’t open and the night mode doesn’t work. customer support? such a let down, rude and won’t listen unless you buy. now, i’m using iphone, and it works very well and it’s still working. apple center will also help with your inqueries. just base on my experience.

Had P20 Pro for more than 2 years..It is still as fast as day one,the battery still goes for more than a full day,games,Netflix etc etc..Best fone I&#39;ve ever had..In a couple of days I&#39;m upgrading to p30 pro new edition,I hope it&#39;s as good..

Wooowww!! I love the speaker tooHow much is it

Do I need a screen protector for this?

I phone - Porsche, one plus- Lamborghini,     Huawei - roll royce
How did you smuggle that thing inside the US?

Can’t wait for the Huawei P90. Excited to take some shots at stuff

Honestly i have iphone xr and i feel like i should swap it to p30 pro, huawei looks a lot better than iphone.

P30 PRO İS KİNG!!!
I got a huawei p30 pro lite for just 200€ nit kidding

How is watching porn on this phone? No cap

Don&#39;t get any phone from Huawei. Screen replacement is $400+. Stay clear

im using the p30 pro since weeks now and its simply the best phone i ever had. i just had to get used to that gestures with the edge, that took some days but well^

One an apple user, always an apple user. Never switching to android

This is when samsung copies the huawei 50x zoom

a year ago this video is the only reason why i have my p30 pro now!  still kicking!

Should I go from an iPhone X to the Huawei P30 Pro? Or should I get the 11 Pro Max (Also I am getting a little bored of iOS, so I am wondering if it is time to switch)

Huawei and Samsung are cooperated companies...

America shit themselves when someone else out does them in the game. Bunch of soft cocks 

Those Days When Huawei P30 Pro Come With Play Store And Almost All Google Services!

OMG YOU STARTED WITH AZERBAIJANI LANGUAGE AHAHAHAHA I&#39;M EXCITED

The p30 pro macro is from a other world!

Anyone else watching after release of p40 models?

A lot of people are saying how Apple is overpriced for a lot of their phones. I do agree that the iphone is lagging behind in their hardware, but I think the Apple user interface is a lot better. I have a Mac and AirPods and the iPhone just integrated everything together so well. Also I don’t really care about the specs of my phones . I’m not going to play any intense games on my phone or do any video editing. I got a computer for that. I just picked up an old iPhone X off eBay for like $300 it will probably last me 2-3 years easy.

512gb 8gb ram version is mine like are bro

Huawei p 30 pro price?
The year is 2012 and there was a korean OLED tech leak incident The year after, OLED manufacturing companies started to appear in china2014 another tech incident in korea and this time it was on batteries The year after chinese battery manufacturers sales volume increased by 220% What a great coincidence

Nofi kinoma I'm sick
I have a Galaxy S10e and for me is more than enough

I prefer the hole punch over the notch

<b>Just recently purchased....</b>

However, the keyboard is not convenient, not at all. Which is important for the smartphone.ps. longer screen - and videos on youtube in normal mode take like 1/4 of the screen, now the only sensible way to watch the videos is a full screen. It&#39;s ok, but leaves you without a choice.

i hate your videos because u just talk and talk and talk alot

Huawei is an extension of the Chinese surveillance state. Don&#39;t fucking buy this shit

My next sexy victim

I&#39;m a huge photography person, and I&#39;ve had my Samsung J3 for YEARS. The camera is absolute crap, and I&#39;ve been looking for an upgrade that won&#39;t break my bank account. HALLELUIA I THINK I&#39;VE FOUND THE ONE!!!!

Huawei is always best

Just bought it.

You can use vivo iqoo neo do a video please?
Please send us more viruses like corona virus, Americans! Please!

the most useful and underrated function is the battery life. i used to own iphone and now  currently have p20pro and i never ever have to worry about carrying around a charger or when is my phone gonna die. one less thing to stress about before leaving home as i know its gonna last whole day even with heavy use

Apple user of 30 years, this is actually making me consider switching.

Does the SmartCamera have a phone app included?? 

I just found a security flaw with this phone.. I can bypass lock screen passcode and fingerprint easily, in fact too easily, with no tools...Contacted Huawei, bitches better pay me or the world gets to see how

just bought p30 pro and  im very happy :)

P30 pro or s20 or s20 plus?PS: i dont care much about cameras

I&#39;m a owner of this beautiful P30 Pro. And he&#39;s right it is the camera champ in that department

Open mine to the max Internet just shit to be 3 degree sorting when the iron goes to max regardless and always jort for as long as I can remember this phone itself works then fine enough only then 3 layer internetg only
<a href="">5:30</a> &quot;general 40 mega pixel camera &quot; omg i still have a phone with 8 mega pixel i he is saying 40mp like nothing

it&#39;s not worth it, Samsung&#39;s are way better

Nah fool, the Chinese are gonna spy on you threw that lmao

cant decide which phone should I buy, iPhone 11 or Huawei P30 Pro. Send help

The camera with the screen still uses hihg tech face-rec technologyAnd the camera can go upto 50X zoom

Huawei could release a phone that obliterates  iPhones specs in every way and I would still choose iPhone purely for iOS. Nothing compares to the smoothness, animation and simplicity of iOS

huawei p30 pro or iphone 11? my iphone se is dying.

Huawei and sony 

Idiot buy a Apple 

I stay with apple   Not believe with he said  my friend has it batere is low faster  n on line is like android only

<b>my favorite color</b>
I only just found out about this phone about a week ago haha and I wanted it and between the price and the coronavirus, I&#39;m absolutely not getting this phone.

Bulky camera advertisers: this camera zooms so well that it is almost a telescope that just happens to capture images.Huawei p30 pro with full smartphone functionality: am I a joke to you?

I got the S10 and i am a huge fan &amp; user of Samsung since nearly 20 years now but i could say honestly the Huawei P30 Pro is overall better than the S10 and even S10+. Why ? P30 Pro has far better camera &amp; battery life than the 3400  mAh S10 (even than the 4100 mAh S10+), from speed they are around the same imo and S10 and S10+ might have a little better screen resolution but nothing to notice really. I would say if you are not a hardcore Samsung fan like me, go for the Huawei P30 Pro, i highly recommend it.

Only Apple products china sucks they eat my friends dogs

Lol I’d rather have an iphone.

<a href="">8:25</a> holly moly, this thing is doing selfies 

How long a phone products line will continue?  Iphone 5s introduced in 2013 but still I can see I don&#39;t know new or refurbished?  Does anyone know?

I’m switching

Question? What you do with your old phones? Do you sell them? or donated? Or keep it? lol

I love its 50 times zoomSo excited about s11 for 100 times zoom
Is this phone still recommendable for this year???

Huawei is good for the camera but if you want to take the overall quality of the phone I must give it to the Samsung Galaxy S10+

I wonder what he does with the smartphones he unboxes!

what&#39;s price in.english money

Now you know how Oppo F15 got painted

This is a beast  I apologise for living in an Apple cave  For a long time, I was ignorant to any other brand as I was brain washed. Huwaaaaae (When I learn to spell it) here I come 

You didn&#39;t use Nightmode Selfie!

Whats the name of track when you test sound?

damn i want to get this one. never been impressed on a phone in my life.

I should’ve got this phone instead of my iphone 11 pro max

It is huawei bro not wawei

Because huawei is just for taking pictures but for me samsung

Who watches It on a p30 pro?

Targeting a s10 it doesnt have headphone jack nobody on earth would not want a headphone jack

You drop this phone, the screen smashes. Really bad design.My girlfriend had this a week.. She had a protective case on it, dropped it once and the screen shattered. These curved screens are useless.

huawei
Looks like a note 10 lol

I have this phone ️

Who is watching this vid with a P30 pro

word to the wise, oakville has i-max corporate campus ,waterloo has the blackberry HQ ,so if your into business partnerships and limited edition phones your going to have a firm setting up a brand consultation between the two for a blackberry that simply has i-max camera at the mobile level for the first time in a global market place

That ir sensor being present really makes me wanna switch to Huawei

Bad thing Trump watched this Video as well :)

Huawei has more views than Note10+. Must means something

&quot;&#39;This camera setup is just.. Bananas&quot;&quot;Unbox Therapy

 march 2019Awesome

No problem Trump got you covered Samsung Apple and other friends :)

Buys the note 10 + bye bye Huawei

I&#39;m not into these techno stuff but my wife gave me this P30 pro a few days ago for my birthday and I just realized a quick a technology changes in 5 years.

You like that colour, have you seen realme 5 pro

The way he put the phone kills me

What hoodie is that damn that shit fire

What song is in the beginning ?

I’d rather phones ya can use with one hand

I just ordered huawei p30 pro, i&#39;ll switch from iPhone 6 but i&#39;m really curious about will it worth or not...

I am from Bangladesh, my age now is 78 years.



I am very much fond of mobile Phones. For the last 10 years, I have been using the Best of Sony, Samsung &amp; Oppo.

The last phone I used was Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, which I sold out in early Dec 2019. AND same day I bought Huawei P30 Pro. My experience with the best mobile phones, I can confidently say that  Huawei P30 Pro is a breakthrough --in many counts.

Why I am writing to you ?? 



I am really very impressed with the way you explained the features and functions of Huawei Phones. AND it made me believe that possibly you may help to solve a small annoying problem in my set for the last 4/5 days. Problem:   I am finding that when someone receives my call, there is always a vibration on my phone ... how do I disable it?

I would be extremely grateful if you can help me.

I got it

Is Huawei P20 Pro still a great phone ?

China is leading technology. Good job China

Prefer the notch. Still using my P20 Pro but due a upgrade this year 

I know it’s good for photos but is it good for my wallet though?

P30 lite boys where u at?

Paying it off next year going back to Apple can&#39;t stand it. Samsungs now look nice tho

I&#39;m watching this on my p30

Switching from s6 edge plus to P30 Pro. Samsung started shitting on me from 2017 itself with late updates and never cared about its old customers. The S8 customers are also facing the same thing right now lol.

Yep im going to buy huawei p30 pro

HAHAH WTF IS THAT PHONEEE AHAHHAHAHAHAHAH

Samsung has become a fucking joke by now. THIS is a real goddamn phone.

I have huawei nova 3 and there&#39;s one problem I hate, that&#39;s been there since I got it little over a year ago. When I&#39;m listening music on headphones the phone lowers the sound a lot. I&#39;ve been playing with huawei sound effects all this time and I can&#39;t turn it off. It&#39;s like in constant mode to save my hearing or something. Because of that listening music has been pain. The volume is so low that I downloaded an app that boosts the volume. It&#39;s not great but having good headphones doesn&#39;t mean shit when the volume is so low. It&#39;s the same if I use bluetooth speaker... It lowers down the music when the song hits the best notes and bass. Very annoying  I got used to it over the year but it still bothers me. Nova 3 was my 2nd huawei phone and I&#39;m thinking to get myself p30 pro. So I hope it won&#39;t have the same &quot;flaw&quot;. Then again, nova 3 isn&#39;t the best phone out there, I simply got it for the price.

Samsung and iPhone will disappear very soon they can&#39;t resist anymoreHuawei is the best

Yesterday I went to a restaurant. I saw there was a WiFi service, so I asked for the password. The waitress told me to eat first, so I placed my order. After eating I asked again for the password and again she told me to eat first. Feeling frustrated I placed another order after eating I asked for the password again. They told me to eat first. Then angrily I went to the restaurant manager I asked for the WiFi password he told me to eat first. I was about to explode  when I finally so a sign on the wallWi-Fi Password=Eat First

The paint job it&#39;s sick and it deflects light in an S shape...

I’m on Apple. This phone is sick and these companies push eachother so I love it all. Competition breeds innovations. But as an Apple user, don’t feel bad for me... if I had to upgrade phones more than once a year that would suck lol.Honestly, if I left Apple.. I can’t find anything comparable to GarageBand app or Music-Memos. Even Pro-Tools can’t quantize entire project-grids to my rhythm (in real time) the way music memos to GB can with lossless audio. And certainly not possible any other way in a few clicks.

Great phone. Just to lament the behavior of the US president. Huawei has almost been crushed. I like when a new company is going to change the whole industry. Huawei comes with the best cameras on mobile. Good prices too. I bought the P20 pro. Now it is 4 months until my Huawei P20 Pro becomes 2 years old. Yesterday I ordered the Huawei P30 Pro. Looking forward to)))

Just got the P30 Pro it&#39;s a great phone my favorite so far

This camera is crap. Why have a 10x zoom if the camera is wobbly and pictures are just crap. I&#39;d take oppo over this any day.

<a href="">6:54</a> oh my gosh that melted my heart 

looks kinda like the note 10

China is dangerous.

<a href="">3:00</a> Welcome🇦🇿
Hey Guys Should I buy this phone for 599€euro or Samsung S10+.......Plz reply and thank you for like me

No cause the skin is trash and it&#39;s illegal

I have the same phone

Still using a mate10pro. It&#39;s been underwater with me when we flip our canoe, way more than once. Survived crazy falls, all with that flimsy case it came with. Pics are comparable to my buddy&#39;s Nikon (he hates that). Hopefully soon I&#39;ll upgrade to the 30. Really wanting a better camera (even though the 10pro is astonishing as is)

Great video!

Yeah...Not convincing. iPhone 11 Pro Max is the best phone. This is garbage.

I’m an iPhone guy myself which none-less to say I hate android base. My wife has the S10+ which is ok, freezes every once in a while, etc - basic android. Her brother lives in Spain and came over for Xmas and he just got the P30 in Spain, unlocked version. I install my ATT SIM card and it worked. Internet was blasting fast. Faster than my iPhone. Unlocking features were amazing, camera? Oh my god, the camera... I thought my wife’s phone had a good camera... we were having my bday bbq last night. He pointed his P30 to the grill and the phone recognized “steak ribeye” and adjusted to food settings. Pointed to the garlic bread and showed “bread” on the screen. And I’ll go further, even showed the calories, proteins, fat, etc, for each item on the screen. I’m not kidding! He uses the phone at a regular rate, play some heavy game, bunch of yt videos and ( pasmem), charges the battery after 3 long days of use. And 100% of charge means <a href="">1:14</a> min. Again, I’m a Mac user and will stand up for iPhone any day but I have to say - and don’t tell my friends - he is buying one back in Spain and will send it to me. I’m going to the dark side of this powerful force

P30: CameraS10: Performance

However, I love huawei.
Rip Google :(

its a situation situation

Unbox Therapy: Woah, that’s a cOLouR!!!  <a href="">1:04</a>

why do people call this chinese spyware?

it has been less than a year and it&#39;s already only 700$

iPhone are just for showing off.

why do people have more iphones for showing off or just because their popular? I suggest they should try other phones like this one.

Just unbelievable Huawei

Apple are working on copying this as we speak

Fuck no shut up already  buy a camera ..morons
I was using apple for 10 years, i been using the pro for 3 weeks and am loving it.

<b>I HAD HUAWEI P999 BUT NASA STOLE IT FROM ME AND USED IT TO TAKE PHOTOS OF PLUTO</b>   LIKE AND HELP
This is so better than ishit

This was made to steal apple users

am i the only one who notices that he has good nails?

Okay! I&#39;m waiting for two years to pass by to buy it lol!

apple is the best phone ever but I do not like its closed system so my preferred phone is the note .

And me with my HP pc with 4gb ram

Give me the phone

I love apple!

I&#39;ve just ordered the P30 Pro as the upgrade for my current phone

Does  google work with this phone?

weee neeed a nova 5t review

Bart baker
But does it have the apple logo? No? Ok then iphone it is.

I have S10+ and Mate 20 Pro. Even Mate 20 Pro overall beats S10+ so no doubt that P30 Pro is better than S10+.Samsung  only can beat Huawei on display beauty and stereo speaker quality. Except that, Huawei is way more practical and better than Samsung as a &quot;phone&quot; and &quot;camera.&quot;

It has 50x zoom. Did you check that out. It will Blow your mind with the stability and clarity

Hey guys im switching from a iphone 11 to a P30 Pro is that a good or bad idea?Because i mean p30 has double ram of 11 pro max and has a better camera but idk

I can confirm that the battery is from another world! And the super charge takes less than an hour to fill to a 100% I swear!

I have this phone and let me tell you I sold my iPhone after receiving this, trust me this is the bomb  and the camera is fucking awesome especially the night camera

Huawei p30 pro is 1000$ in Serbia with everything u need

P30pro looks great!
P30pro looks great!
If they only maintain jack

What is Apple?

How does he have play store on the p30 pro

need the zoom for that BTS concert...

Huawei bad moble no sef      i het this moble

My moble Huawei moble this moble no sefe

I’m gonna upgrade from a 4s to a p30 lite

They said they dont need the US lately. Not sure if that means theyll never sell here or if its wrong.

I just got the iPhone 11 and I regret it

Im not subscribing your chanel but still I&#39;m watching your videos because i like your style and your reviews

<b>There&#39;s only one drawback it&#39;s bigger than my both hands!</b> 

Huawei
If I was you... Honestly I would just want to be me.

Thanks for making up my mind!! Getting it this week. Your review was straight forward, funny and detailed. Loved it. Keep it up! I&#39;m definitely watching more. :)

I&#39;ve owned apple products for around 7 years. iPhone after iPhone after iPhone. Last month I got myself a change, Samsung s10+. I  could&#39;ve waited a couple months and get the  s11, but I just couldn&#39;t stand the iPhone. It&#39;s the same every year. I give apple a couple years till they completely go BlackBerry.

If it was like 300$ then they will take the market.

P30 pro

Trying to get off an app is a pain. The swipe is awfull

Whats a good site I can buy one? With the phone cover case included along with with screen cover. Charger and headphones.

p30

Can i have one lol

I think that&#39;s the same display as the Moto z4...

Should I order this phone? just i live in the US ...

Huawei is banned so bye HAHAHA

I just got the p30 pro, so far the camera is really good; i tried taking a picture of the moon and it turned out SO clear. I suggest this phone. The camera is really great. Typing this comment from my p30 

Does this phone come with 32GB or just 8GB ?

give me one

P20 pro vs P30 pro
No more androids be like memes

Still love my Huawei Mate 9... after all these years, it’s still fast and still keeps up with the tech today 

you can check Huawei p30 pros camera in a studio
Which dog breed is there can anyone tell me..? Unbox Therapy

THE best voice/accent 
The fingerprint unlocks your privacy

I&#39;m only here because it has a beautiful color

I’ve got the iPhone 11 pro max, i must admit the camera and display blew me away. The only reason i stick to iphone is the apple eco-system, i’ve got an apple watch, ipad, iphone etc its all about compatibility, nothing more. Its like drugs once you get hooked up its hard to break through.

<a href="">2:55</a> welcome!)
Huawei or iphone 11?
You lowkey looking like McTapper in that selfie hahaha

Why don&#39;t you review any umidigi phones???

Can you please do a review on The jbl tune 500bt headphones plz

Insane low price for the tech

I would never buy a Huawei phone ever again, the company&#39;s  customer service is truly terrible, I own a mate 20 pro after a few weeks the screen turned green, a fault they are well aware of, but after multiple complaints the phone still hasn&#39;t been repaired or replaced, at least samsung or apple will either repair your device or replace it same day.

hey guys those that use the phone in USA can you let me know what carries are you with? how is the connection ?I heard that the connection drops a lot,like a lot, 5 times a day switching to airplane mode on/off to get it back &lt; at&amp;t&gt;

Nice mobile
Made in china Six month nehi calega.

low category phone

music sounded much louder than lew..

Huawei sucks.
Hes right about the camera. It is really that good!!

Can you please tell which Huawei Mate 20 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro are the best to buy?

I just got one, and i telling you that this devices is incredible, the screen, performance, the cameras, they all flawless. The only downside of this product is the speaker, its not that great as compared to the s10, but it still on the flagship zone.

Such an awesome awesome phone yo

Just got one !

haha.. LITERALLY just bought the p30 lite haha AMAZING phone!!!

As a galaxy user I tend to laugh at any outdated &quot;new&quot; phone apple releases    but I&#39;m afraid that Samsung finally has something to compete against the Huawei p30 pro is a beast

Watching this video on a p30 pro

It has <b>x50</b> Zoom and I still can&#39;t see John Sena

where is your Blue Jays hat?

Nice one

I wish it notchless

Just came here from JRE&#39;s video and I&#39;m so grateful that Lew is not scratching the metal side with a razor...

everzbody want to fuck up huawai in us because its getting better then an stupid iphone

Whats is the situation with the Andriod Play Store / Google services? Will there be an issue buying this?

people use apple for the operating system if i could run ios natively on this phone i would love to switch over

Forget about this Apple i phone 11 is trouble against Huawei Mate 30 pro...

Dont know weather to get latest samsung or this huawei, currently have iphone

Looks pretty sick but I still don’t like android phones <b>yet</b>

I own 1 and it&#39;s the best phone I&#39;ve ever had

Huawei P100 Pro let me just get in the future and show you whats up

And im still here using my Huawei 5 lite ...

Who is here after the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro launch ?

this phone is a game changer

my dream

An Apple user! Seriously thinking of switching ‍️
is it possible use it with a stylus?

the phone made steve jobs turn over in his grave.

40mp dang....
now a days all mobile phones are not mobile phones it is a camera with a phone. all phones rights now are getting expensive because of the cameras they have..

How many SIM cards can this phone have? They never say

i just have mine p30 pro and ilove it

a70 beated the p30

This is getting old type of situation

It does look a lot identical to Samsung galaxy A30

How will the United States ban on Chinese manufacturers affect Huawei&#39;s use of Google&#39;s and Microsoft OS and software? Great phone, but Is it now risky to buy Huawei phones?

This phone looks so cool

P30

Very pretty =)

What i would give for that phone, i own a galaxy s6 lol

I bet 5k robux Willy du has a p30 pro

By far the sexiest looking phone

This phone is sick I just can’t switch from  I’m so deep in the ecosystem why can’t  just make good technology

I can finally comment on this... In no way shape or form can the p30 pro compare to the S10+!I was sooo disappointed with the p30 Pro after everyone hyped it up so much. The only props I will give it is for the battery life

I ran my P10 plus for 2 years. Just picked up my P30 plus a few days ago. Yep It is an awesome machine! its face recognition works so fast its a bit scary. The camera is obviously active all the time!

s10 suck

As an Apple user I wanna switch to the s10 

Sous

The sound sounds good from my phone.

So happy to my new phone Huawei P30 pro 

Nope Samsung is not in trouble Huawei is shit

Huawei Is shit !!!!
Next Huawei phone is going to be Sate30 pro, with Satellite Zoom Technology. I wanna book it right now.

Hey everyone I really want to buy p30 pro Anyone tell me how&#39;s it is p30 pro if anyone already using please

Its crazy how when it entered the market a sudden hype was created and now no one&#39;s even talking about the P30 proIt died too earlyIf this happened to Apple

Huawei nova 5TAre really good?

Was 80% of this video saying &quot;it&#39;s got a camera&quot; ?

hi unbox ....bro
big up HUAWEI

&quot;Its and expensive phone BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT ITS KINDA PRETTY&quot;. Huawei lost my love because they went in with Samsung price range but they still rock.

The camera is over hype in my opinion... it is fairly good for a phone i guess but nothing to rave so much about. Maybe in a few years phone will take as good photos than a basic high quality 1 inch sensor point and shot camera like a sony or panasonic. You better buy a samsung smarphone over this cause the p30 pro as nothing else going on beside the camera.

sorry am kinda curious as to what language your phone is set in the beginning of the video there. because I understand turkish, so it was very similar to it and could understa d what was written there. is it a language similar to turkish?

GHOST NOTES -FINISH HIM 
good work
SHAME ON YOU HUAWEI- NO 3.5MM JACK

<b>Autoplay on home</b> in huawei p30 pro is not available on huawei youtube app, please advise.

huawei: ha ha ha  samsung note10 +: i got your back bro!
I am using a shit iPhone7 right now, I want to switch to Huawei but my parents won&#39;t allow me 

I wish Huawei make their own system, I don’t like Android

Just 2 years ago, I would never in my life buy a Huawei phone. Just 2 years later, I want one.

why does the software still look like cheapo iOS?

CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN TO ME Y HUAWEI IS BANNED IN THE STATES?

I love that smartphone

Yeah but it&#39;s Huawei

ill get get mine on monday!!!
Has anyone tried playing pubG on it? Is it good?

I was recommended to get get the p30 not the p30 Pro cuz the pro is more breakable and there not better

Comment section1. Future gens of it to take pics of other galaxies2. Who is here after the ban?3. Who is here after ban removal?

is there any other way on how to remove too much saturation in huawei? coz I&#39;m currently not happy with my huawei p30 in terms of too much saturation

 wow 
I feel bad huawei thinks they gonna beat Samsung

How about a review in p30 lite

Honor 20 Pro and honor 20

Apple has no hope

You Should Review The Huawei P30 Pro Amber Sunrise Edition

im here because my trusty s7 edge...i know...that has served me for a little over  3 years just fell and broke... so the universe has basically pushed me into an upgrade.... Huawei it is then

It&#39;s hurts me when he bangs the phone on the table 

<b>Huawei is about to dethrone samsung and Apple</b>USA- <b>Not In My House</b>

So what should I end up buyingS10 or P30?My current phone (P20)

fuck u man
This year I will buy one I can&#39;t wait 

THUMPS UP IF YOU WATHING THIS FROM A NOKIA 3200

Lew: face set up was quick*China inserting Lew&#39;s face into their global mainframe*:

This is the phone for stalking people.

Love my P30 Pro with 512GB Memory plus 8GB RAM.Got freebies such as Watch, Wireless Earphones and Powerbank.

Watching this with p30 pro haha

I love this phone whiteout curve edge

P30 Pro is the best phone in the market, i just love it

This mobaile is life time used best or not

I literally have the best time zooming into people yards away from me with the camera on this thing. That&#39;s what sold me. xD

Good for you, buying a phone from a company that is actively involved in stealing americas corporate intellectual property secrets. Ill bet your so proud.your either an idiot or a traitor.

The Samsung s10 isn’t in trouble because the “hot new phone” is banned all phones, laptops, etc are banned.

Huawei banned in US ..why not in China banned iPhone Lol

HUAWEI P30 PRO The BEST PHONE 2019

the phone has better specs than my computer lmao

Meanwhile&quot;buy OuR nEw IpHoNe XR, iT hAs A dIsPlAy FrOm TeN yEaRs AgO&quot;
Yo I want to switch now Goodbye XR

The fact that you use cases on your Phone shows you care about your investment lol.

Try Nokia 9

I still Prefer OnePlus 7 Pro 7 Pro is much faster than huawei p30 pro One Plus 7 Pro has 90GHz Oled Display

What i hate about huawei it has no gorilla glass

Why P30?

I love my P30 Pro..

Some poor people likes to comments alot more than rich people 

Big respect all the way from Trinidad and Tobago bro-if consumers LISTENED to your reviews with the level of openmindedness that al human beings should possess,then the  term &quot;Brand Loyalist&quot; would become obsolete-Great job as always-A collab with you and Flossy Carter would be lit !!!!

<a href="">11:04</a> talking about the camera on a phone. That&#39;s it.

I like both phones, the s10 and the new Huawei. It’s like they are brother and sister  the only phone company I don’t like is apple 

It&#39;s there most of the phone copy Huawei honor&#39;s punch hole camera. Including Samsung ...

I assume China is collecting data: Fingerprints togerther with your face...

just buy it！！
ok maybe Huawei p30 is popular &quot;but still&quot; much cheaper than iphone x

It&#39;s nice but we ain&#39;t allowed to have it here in the USA lmfao   IDGAF though I got one. I had to buy bring it over the boarder from Canada then into Seattle then back down to Myrtle Beach SC where I live lol.. I went to see family and decided to buy the phone so I had my uncle order it and pick it up for me then when we got there I paid him for it ECT through a case on it and that&#39;s all she wrote

I have an iPhone 7 Plus. I’m an iPhone user/fan since the iPhone 3G. I’m really impressed with this phone. Any one have switched from an iPhone 7 Plus or newer iPhone to the p30 pro? Is it worth it? ( I’m into phone photography)

Huawei P30 Pro is Real Beast Camera Phone &amp; better &amp; also best than  Galaxy S10

I also want to buy a Huawei mobile phone. Do you have any recommendations?

Huawei is very good.

Design are just superb ..

I’m getting one in 2 days, I’m an apple user and I’m more for the mini speaker and music. I’m still unsure about this, no headphone port? Hmmm.

the color look like shit

In future smartphones won’t be smartphones they will be a pc with 100 cameras

What are you doing with all phone after you review it??

Iwish i had p100000000000000 pro  100000000gigs of ram 1 billion rom price 1 dollar

I’m going through a battleiPhone XS Max: on list because I know how to use AppleP30 pro: amazing camera but android and I don’t know how to use huawei

Perhaps you should do videos on low budget phones too.

What&#39;s with the cameras?? Beacuse no one cares about cameras smh

This is awesome and amazing ️

Is it water proof? :/

Does P30 pro have edge panels like S10+?

That&#39;s a pretty phone ;-;

Whos here before 4.5mil views?

I consider only two companies for smartphone, Samsung or Apple

Will Huawei come out with mate 30x, competing with Samsung&#39;s note 10?

Why are you always look at the right hand side

Omg that&#39;s my phone. Oh wait I have the lite version r.i.p

Im just amazed my midrange Huawei nova 3i, then the p30 pro came out im just keep amazed the huawei devices

SG S10

When a cop tells you to unlock your phone and then he realizes you have face recognition on and he points it at your face :o/  Say bye-bye to your Video Evidence.   Never Ever Use Face Recognition if you plan to record a police encounter :o/ Not even Fingerprint is safe, they can get it from your fingers while you are cuffed.  Be smart, not lazy and use code lock.

Iphone user: Lets buy a telescope to see the stars Me: I have P30 PRO

I&#39;m from the Philippines!

Hi Lew, I&#39;m a big fan and a subscriber to your channel and I wish I could win a brand new smartphone! Thank you!

Watching in my P30 lite

<i>Huawei</i>

<b>lwhsiwi</b>
God damn it enough with the f notches

Watching on OnePlus 6

i think i found my new phone

I like it
Next p40 pro you can see the moon and have night goggles like them navy seals.

Why should I pay $700 more to get something last like Apple?

Apple? It’s in the past

China is awesome!
40 MEGAPIXEL-
Fuck swappie

Samsung s10 plus is best

he switch S10 to P30 pro...  P30 pro 

Apple comes out and gets beaten!
Hoo-wow-ee is how it’s pronounced in England.

yeh l got this phone now lol  love it so much lol 

This is my favourite holographic colour, I always wanted it to have a name. From now on, breathing crystal 

Can you give me huwai p30 pro
Not worth for this price, Samsung users definitely miss the touch of it if they switch over to this phone, same feeling here

Me: <b>Reads title....</b>Me after reads title: <b>Yes it is...</b>

ios is done for, it&#39;ll soon be a thing of the past

I just bought my p30 pro 128 gb  6 ram yesterday, it&#39;s nuts lol.

As an apple user, really considering switching wow

Me, Nokia 3310.
You need to work on your camera shooting skill Should show more of the product then yourself

Dude you should compare it to the &quot;clone&quot; p35 pro. I see them going for $90-$120 depending on sites. By the way love your videos man, keep it up!!

The difference between mid range and high end phone cameras is too much

A citizen in Foshan, Guangdong bought a Huawei P30 mobile phone, but the battery exploded after 10 days of use.
Who&#39;s here after Huawei got unbanned?

The only ones I found didn&#39;t have the us plug

Huawei  and Oppo convoHuawei p30 pro x50 zoom: i have a farthest zoom!OPPO Reno X10= x60 zoom: hold my lens!!
I do not understand. Why does Huawei make such stupid mistakes ????  front camera 32mp without autofocus .... funny ... did anybody ask them the question why such nonsense is working ... every normal one would not buy such a phone ... why the 32mp camera and the pictures are blurry and disgusting

A real flagship phone that actually worth for it&#39;s price. Unlike an overpriced bitten piece of fruit.

These phones are taking over

Who carrier the service for this phone

if u r a fangirl u must buy it
The night mode camera is op

Just recieved it on my birthday and this was great i think this phones are one of t he true modern phones

why is there no nokia 9 review

Bye apple, hello huawei.
Really really awesome. Little notch for selfie camera is a better idea, rather than having a flip. I am waiting for the mate 30x,hopefully the mate pen is inserted in the phone. Tq bro.

Just saying its pronounced HUAWEI - whoawe

Huawei p 40 is best android phone of world .

A phone made for the GODS!

Holy Moley

Huawei: <b>Creates one of the best cameras in a phone</b>Samsung: <b>Creates a battery behemoth in a phone</b>Apple: <b>dO i nEeD a hEadPhoNe JaCk? NaH LetS UsE A LCD DiSplaY iN 2019!</b>

Who&#39;s here after huawei got un-banned?

Does the huawei p30 pro box comes with a Bluetooth earphone?

I really love the slim design of this smartphone. Besides, the battery life is durable with high storage capacity.

switched from a surface book gen 1 to a huawei mate x pro, im thinking my next swap is my samsung s9+ to a huawei

It&#39;s crazy how fast new phones come out in such a short period. Personally if I was a P20 owner, I&#39;d be pissed watching this video of the new P30!

Can you watch yt witj that thing

Who&#39;s here after trump lifts ban?

Watching this after reading that huawei is back slaps in a typa awesome way

Who here after huawei is back ?

At <a href="">2:00</a> he puts the phone down so hard

gei

Are jou stupid

Recent all Huawei phones have very innovative features that other phones didn&#39;t do. For example the first screen print lock, reverse charge and 50x times zoom . It is really amazing this company every year developing amazingly

I see you rocking that bylt

I&#39;ve got it:-{:-{

next phone will surly be Huawei

Time to buy me one! Thanks for the review!

Watching this on a Samsung. Just ordered the p30 pro today. I was very against Huawei. I guess we see how she is.

@<a href="">7:30</a> when the camera used for professional content making cant see in dark but it can using the phone&#39;s screen. damn

what about the headphone jack? how do you use headphones with that phone??

This looks almost exactly like the leaked details of the Note 10.... How weird lol.

this camera setup is just.....BANANAS!!!?

It's the processor spicy chicken

i want it

Just wOw!!!!

Please make video of samsung A80 Plz plz plz plz

My new phone is cheaper, and have 5000 milliamp power

Watching in a P20 Pro and I should&#39;ve waited for this 3 months ago.. :((

It&#39;s mostly a fine phone, but ultimately it is defective: It can&#39;t run apps in the background. Their battery optimization is insane, you can&#39;t fully get rid of it. Apps that I rely on, that need to run in the background, are constantly killed. The phone just does not work. I wish I could give it back, but I can&#39;t so fast, because I need to write a piece on it. But I think my SIM card will wander back to my old LG V20 that is barely working anymore. But even so, eventhough Bluetooth calls don&#39;t work at all, eventhough battery lasts 2 hours and I need to reboot it twice just to get it to run, and eventhough I&#39;m getting error messages every 2 minutes because the custom ROM is a nightmare... that experience is still better than EMUI with its crappy battery optimizations.

Huawei P30 Pro, P30 and Mate 20 Pro WILL get Android Q upgrade

Why don&#39;t you unbox the lite version?

yo watch me using that camera to zoom in on the tv for my blind ass

suddenly getting further seats in a concert doesnt seems so bad after all

wow this phone is so good l really hope they say yes to me and my mum tomorrow 

Huawei: we got the best camera and one of the best phone!Trump: Google Help me!Google: what? i didnt listen!Trump: I got an idea! <b>bans Huawei and everything</b>Huawei:*confused pikatchu*

No apple.....From today

huawei always have some problem and same problem with the android software..hope the new ark can make the huawei perfect...(huawei phone is beauty but have some illness..ark is the medicine to perfect it).

I&#39;m still going for this device, and f*ck Trashmouth Trump!

need this 1

U can’t use playstore. So it’s useles
How about the A70

My phone. Buy my phone. 50 % off for the first 50,000 buyers at any outlet!!!

I&#39;m not for one moment knocking the Samsung phones down in any way. However there are still a handful of people that remain loyal to one brand, for example iPhone buyers. Huawei seem to have really gone to town on their phones.  I think people should try Huawei before swearing their allegiance to the current market leaders. You never know you might end up changing your view.I like the review but will still like to try it first hand.

Phones becoming smarter and humans becoming dumber.

I NEED THIS PHONE WHAT THE HECK WHY HAVENT I SEEN ANY ADS OR HEARD ABOUT THIS UNTIL TODAY ???

Regardless of the whole Huawei ban thing, I&#39;m still looking to buy one of these. If anyone is tryna sell theirs, lmk, I&#39;m willing to pay

Now you can&#39;t buy one because the government say it full of Chinese spyware... But is ok for Google, Facebook and our government...hahaha

How much....

with the current problems huawei is going through do u recommend buying one at this stage? i am considering a p30pro or a mate20pro, the samsung s10+ or the iphone xs+

I hets apple

Bruh I just want it right now but I&#39;m a kid

Still no dual camera video recording front and back camera video shoot for this is what I expected to a new generation of smart phone everything else will be so so yesterday if  there one right now

IPhone X merged with Samsung 10

TELESCOPES ARE QUAKING

I&#39;ve been with apple since the iPhone 5 honestly the best thing I  done was leave them many phone phones are just as good or overtook them people still buy apple because of the name all apple are doing is is being lazy and ripping people off but they have many sheep fan boys

P30 or s10?

Boring. Just talking about camera.

Too bad it is a Chinese phone, so I&#39;ll probably never buy it.



* making many developed countries come into eternal debt to China *

* persecute people who have certain religious backgrounds *

* remove Tibet as its own cultural area *

* forcible taking organs of political opponents - those who are not communists *

Digital zoom? Didn&#39;t it have a periscope?

Would not be buying a Huawei phone right shoot all these apps being pulled from the phones like Facebook now

Huawei is actually improving 

Never heard of dis

Not now lmao

The title is the other way around!!

Rip people in usa
I&#39;m telling you right now Huawei copied a mixture of the S10 and the iPhone X

Huawei is gone, crab rave sounds in the background

Yes sir the samsung gots a really really big trouble..

Wphy

Goodbye Apple cannot wait !!!

Show us how it looks on sc

&quot;Is Samsung in trouble?&quot; Not after the ban

My man is practically slamming the phone on the table. <a href="">2:53</a> 

P30 is awesome

Thanks for the review, I was in the confusion if buying S10 plus or p30 pro. Now I bought p30 pro.

Could you please reveiw the samsung galaxy A70

Yeh it&#39;s expensive, but it&#39;s nothing compared to the top sped s10 and the top spec Iphone X, and it&#39;s arguably better.

Dayum China that&#39;s a sexy phone.

Please do a review and unboxing on the generic p35 pro android phone 6.3

For apple users: you were laughing at Huawei now Huawei is laughing at you

The phone is a bloody SPY!

Wow owesome，This is my moment alone

lmao the phone dead

Where do u buy this phone in the usA?

Apple users be like , hey urgent meeting required for better camera ffs

P30 pro

Got a serious question: knowing what&#39;s going on with Huawei being banned by Google, if I buy this phone from eBay or Swappa, will I be able to sign in to google account on this phone to get all the synced apps, photos, contact, etc??? Will I have access to my google account? My saved pics in my google photos? I would get this phone for the camera alone.

<a href="">3:00</a> Bosnian Latin hahahahah

<a href="">1:59</a> DONT DROP THE PHONE LIKE THAT IT COST LIEK 1000 QUID!!!

Best phone which is ban in democratic USA

If Huawei brings out a telescope accessory to use with the P30 Pro cameras to allow me to see the closeup surface of our moon then i&#39;m definitely getting a P30 Pro.

<b>Was</b>

The moment he said 5x though 

Apple: can we make a deal Huawei?, you give me your camera or Donald Trump is going to ban you.

Is the boot loader unlocked?

And when we can’t compete let’s slap a tariff and some trade bans and call it a day. seething.

3 things Americans dont feel comfortable buying1. Chinese phone2. Chinese TV3. Chinese cars , oh hell no

So what do you do when you have a new contender on the phone business? Banned them .......im an apple user ,not thiking to change my phone but I wouldnt want there to be just Samsung to be the “ only other  company “ with a decent phone ...

This is the reason why huawei is banned simply because huwei nailed it. Huawei beat up the shit uot of other american smart phone... Then they call a threat.!

This shit is kinda funny today.All you turn coats and your spy shit.JKDon&#39;t bust out the preparation H just yet.

you need to box it again now lol

Samsung:wow,who&#39;s in trouble now¿HUAWEI:motherfucker trump!

Now everybody can be a spy to anyone...

I’m waiting for something REALLY GOOD from apple this year. SERIOUSLY!! this Huawei phone and the S10  bang the apple devices in all the ways.    

I think banning Huawei is not gonna make them bankrupt , they will create chinnese version of android .Very simple .

Who&#39;s watching after Android ban on Huawei ?

No Android updates for Huawei - I guess Huawei P30 is in trouble

bye bye  huawei
Not anymore

RIP Huawei

Huawei is banned

Rip huawei
Yeah but Samsung is Samsung, and Huawei is Huawei. You get me? Huawei copies both Samsung and Apple. Samsung + Apple = Huawei lol  Samsung&#39;s software and just everything is way better man, try it yourself. I&#39;d rather get the S10 

Google service is stopped. Go to get a Huawei, dumb ass⋯^_^

Google cancel its relationship with this phone so it&#39;s useless now

Huawei is in trouble Google is splitting up with the company help huawei pls

This caption didn&#39;t age well

Samsung in trouble?? In America?? Nope
As a Verizon customer, this isnt even an option for me -_-

Google might kill it very soon

honestly to me, it is a overpriced shit!

No headphone jack :(
Sweet

Samsung is dead finally

can huawei p30 pro convert into a desktop like. just like samsung galaxy s10+ have? the DEX?

@unboxtherapy I&#39;ve been watching your videos for a long time now and I love your videos

I&#39;m personally using the Huawei nova 3i which have a very good detailed cam by the way, actually, I may be switching to the p30 pro. or the s10+ don&#39;t know

Oneplus 7 Pro has no notch and because of that simple feature alone I prefer it.

i would go for 1plus 7 pro because instead of taking loads  pictures i watch a lot of videos and having a full display makes it better

I&#39;m fucking buying it

Your favorite phone

Will never use a Mainland cell phone. You want to be watch by a government which is rule by law, or you want to be watch by a government which is rule by &quot;no law&quot;? It is your choice⋯^_^

Apple will never be the same since Steve Jobs has passed away...I&#39;m a huawei fan... AND ANDROID AWAY WILL KEEP THE APPLE AWAY !!!!

dont know if i should send my student loan on this or take a gap year to work full time to earn some cashington???????

I&#39;m switching to p30 pro from Samsung galaxy note 9

Watching this on the p30 lol

I have Huawei p30pro

Thanks for the review but, most of all, thank for introducing me to Ghost Note. I don&#39;t know how they&#39;ve passed me by...

Does Huawei pro has headphone jack ?

Huawei take your money back

You are so boring mannnnnnnn...

what are you&#39;re thoughts on the honor 8x? I was looking through your vids but didn&#39;t see I. I&#39;ve seen reviews and bought one but I love your videos and they way you bring your opinion across

Best phone!! Huawei

Perfect for concerts  specifically bts concerts lol

Huahwi anyone?

Wahwhey?

Lew can request for huawei p30 pro reviews?

No. It&#39;s Huawei. You can&#39;t trust them. I had a Huawei employee tell me he would never use one as a personal phone.

they brought they A game

HOW CAN I GET HUAWEI IS THE U.S?

The only thing they need to work on is UI

have you done the vivo dual lcd phone yet??

My broke ass probably needs to set up a Gofundme account so I can buy this phone!

Watching without buying ep. 264

32 megapixels front facing camera and 40 megapixels rear facing cameras... Which company can compete with that?

No, because EmUI sucks.

Can u give me iPhone X please if you read this my Facebook is monky king answer me please

I might buy this just for the camera, because I’ll definitely be missing some of my iPhone apps that aren’t on Android.

Do Nokia pureview 9
That pricetag though

Hopefully Samsung will Never Give up..

I’m going to work a job in the summer and I think imma save up for this 

MATE 20 PRO OR P30 PRO?
800 Euros now and currently waiting for mine to arrive next week.

That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been saying. I don&#39;t know how Apple users do it.

I tried p30 camera in the Huawei store that’s holyshit awesome 40x    I can shoot even something I can’t see by my eyes( with glasses)

Imagine this phone was announced in 2014

I&#39;m watching on a p30 pro

I just bought one comming in 1-3 days

The camera on the Huawei is just.. amazing but the audio and mic.. ehhh..

This is why america does not want it there it will fuck up apple 

Oops I’ll forever be an apple user

Itd be nice if you could edit the photos into the video so we can see how great they really are

I have an I phone but I’m thinking of switching to p30 ?

Wow you have already a lot of phones give me one

Watching this on my P20 

Im so pissed no head phone jack

In your opinion guys, what do you think is better? SAMSUNG or HUWAWEI?

What should I get? I have been a Loyal iPhone user but now I am getting interested in Huawei and Samsung

This is guy is so cool.   I always watch his videos all the way

huawei is really uping their game

i&#39;m glad that i did go for s10

A phone with a 16x9 screen, squared off corners, uniform minuscule bezels and a slide up front facing camera would be perfect. Until then I&#39;ll stick with my S9+ because I can&#39;t stand notches.

When the mate 30 pro comes iam gunna sell my Xs max witch I would of had for a year by then and have some change I phone are the ultimate in keeping there value can’t wait for the mate 30 that’s going to be a hard device to beat

Thank you bros sharing! Can this phone unlock version works at U.S SIM cards?

Kids these days still think apple is better

Kinda nervous at how much I’m thinking out switching from an apple to huawie... 

Huawei phones could be banned in my country ;-;RIP New Zealand

Giveaways
Honestly, as a Samsung fanboy, I&#39;m actually considering the p30 or a future model. As much as I love Samsung, these lesser known companies really bring out the bang for your buck. They probably make far less than Samsung or Apple, yet they can put so much into their devices and charge a reasonable price.

Samsung S10 has left the groupIPhone XR has left the group

Watching on a Huawei Device

I think iPhone will start to loose ground with this phone and further ones in the future.

&quot;Wow, look at these beautiful photos I took!&quot;Everyone in the Chinese government: &quot;Meh, we&#39;ve seen better.&quot;

Huawei p30&#39;&#39;&#39;pro..best&#39;mobile
Can I eat this phone already

If i had money to spare i would buy just because of the camera :)

I&#39;m literally considering buying this phone. You convinced me

solid grabe

huawei = fuckwe
Good bye Apple !!

Just got this today

Huawei : All your data are belong to us (correction, all your data are belong to Chinese government)

Iphone making a phone camera like this will go for 5000dollars

America; night vision- all greenChina; Alright let&#39;s turn a night into day,!Literally this flagship huawei device is a telescope pretending to be a phone!

Sadly it is banned in USA

I have a huawei p9 it&#39;s a good phone but i will have a better phone like huawei p30 pro

Army: the enemy is on the move,get me the scopeHauwai: lol that&#39;s cute

Hauwei I love huawei &lt;3
Huawei is a copycat.  Apply macbook, Huawei called matebook. Apple AirPod, huawei called flypod. They look exactly like apples.  And copy the speak too.

R.I.P APPLE(Im typing this on my Apple iPad )

Apple to Huawei... Huawei the bestttt

Does it have a slomo camera?

Why Huawei use Mali-G76 MP10. This is ridiculous. Adreno 640 is far better in all benchmarks. All big brands like Sony, Samsung, Asus etc use Adreno. The CPU is good but not perfect. The only good thing is the camera.

P30 Pro is great device

Can we get the z4 play from motorola

I thing tencent need to change the 15x scope to Huawei phone...Really the camera can zoom in and can see your acne

I think...you shouting so much.

Huawei is stronger than i thought Samsang be careful because huawei is going to be number one

After Huawei p30 releasedSamsung left the chat (just now)IPhone left the chat (one year ago)

Can it run fortnite?

P30p is a spyware,it can delete your porn videos from your phone,don’t buy it

Apple user for 8years and this phone is making me want to say good bye to apple

Hi could you please tell us the distance used in taking those pictures , because picture quality varies with distance and light

Next: P30 pro+ esX Max lite.
gonna wait for a 2nd hand p30 pro…

Also, THANK YOU FOR DOING A DOG!! That&#39;s a real shot.. just missing the living room light lol.  (should be on both phones)

The camera on HP30P is to die for!  It makes the Galaxy in trouble.  But overall, I still need headphone jack. So there ya go.

P30 pro

Azerbaijani language 
No headphones?
Sony Xperia xz3 I don&#39;t need that fancy Camara the hole description is about the Camara it got me so confused that I lost track if it was a cámara or a cellphone.

I&#39;m buying Huawei. Fuck America and its oligarchy&#39;s effort to stifle Huawei&#39;s leading 5G technology

The problem is Its too expensive

i aspire to be this rich @ <a href="">1:58</a>

Huawei should work together with Samsung and unleash a beast!

u didnot even said the specs for once and price or any information......not the camera examples

P30- We gon take ummm way way way way up!
This is serious tech right here !

Ohwghaaad I want one of this phone

It sends all of your data to China Communist Party.

I&#39;m stuck between getting the huawei p30 pro and the s10 plus. Any suggestions?

Samsung is fucked. Apple is still eating glue.

no p mean premuim
Where is it $200? Amazon its expensive

p30 pro : super zoomtelescope : am I joke to you

I really want one but i don&#39;t even have a single penny

The P30 is amazing.  Too bad that I can not afford one.

Got mine last week its camera is awesome

I love my p20, now p30 can be so much love!  that makes you crazy for having so much! So im not buying 

Now I want to move from iPhone to huawei

I personally prefer the semi-large notch (for example on the G8) since to me, it&#39;s more aesthetically pleasing causing it to be less distracting.

Lew Give phone pleasse.

I got this phone for a couple of weeks now and i fucking love it. You can do so much with it

Bye bye  Iphone !
Can somebody please advise me how to disable the blur effect. ie take normal photos with the background without it getting blurred out

More dog pics please. Thanks!

Im inlove with this phone

where do you even buy the P30 Pro

I am watching  this wonderful video in my beautiful mate 9 pro but i will buy p30 pro  soon

no headphone jacks??? ok sorry p30 pro but i need them

Next huawei phone: B30B for Binoculars
I wonder how the MATE 30 PRO will be like! 

Big fan
S10 is in trouble

When did this cheap phone reach these heights?

Won&#39;t work with Verizon.

The screen will never be like  the ones from Samsung.

ALL To help Me I am confused P30 Pro OR X SMAX ..... I need help Now I used I phone 7 .????

I think P30 would be useful if ever I left my glasses at home again.

I feel sorry for people who get sucked in by apple Coz there phones aren&#39;t no we&#39;re near as good as huawei and there missing out. 

Price?

you are the best really.

I think huawei p30 pro is way better than my telescope!

Been a apple user and switched to android and no switching back. I liked the apple software more but for the price difference you can get a android for it&#39;s worth it

Bought this phone after watching this usless review. He chats shit most of the time. Battery life is terrible, camera ? Hmmm its shit... 40mp? Hmm there is no zoom in 40mp mode, post processing in pics horrid, low light pictures terrible.... screen lags while you Filming.... Finger recognition don’t work half a time, face recognition not working every time... THIS GUY IS A SALES MAN...

Huawei p400 a phone which can capture through dimensions!

am watching this on my iPhone 5.

This phone looks amazing! Wow!

Does it have better camera than pixel 3 ?

The camera is awful.

5 years from now it will sell for under $300 I will buy it then .....

Unbox Oppo Reno :D
HuaWei&#39;s device is more and more incredible,but I choose Apple ,still.

Gosh I wanna have that phone:((((( but I don&#39;t have money Soo sad:((

I&#39;m happy my first phone was Huawei and I kinda grew up on it, not wanting other phone brands..Just happy to see how far Huawei can improve and level up their tech.

Is it worth it?

Too bad it&#39;s Chinese don&#39;t want them fuckers spying on me I&#39;ll stick with my iPhone

Why would you name a multi million dollar cell phone company huaweii

Put the pictures on the screen u cant see crap when u just show the picture on the phone jeez

Samsung is the winner.  I used Samsung Note for over 9 years.    I admit Samsung Quality is trustable best.  Plus I like Urban feeling Samsung Style.   Chinese brands just untrustable.

Yeah iPhone are pretty much out of business

now I know what I as a gift if I be valedictorian(impossible) XD

If you are black do not I repeat use the face recognition

Guys I need help lol I had enough with my iPhone :/ so I’m switching to either p30 or s10 plus .. what do u guys recommend

i wish i could have something like that, that&#39;s the best camera phone ever but also galaxy S10 to have a largest storage but huawei p30 pro the best :)

Samsung is loosing market. They&#39;re busy bumping up prices than actualy making phones.

I thought his hat said <b>Blyat</b>

Huawei $1,000,000,000
Don&#39;t just show what you&#39;ve got. Give one to me.

Crapple is in trouble

P 30 is awesome.

I got my mate 20 pro, then few months after, p30 pro was released, then few months will come, mate30 will come. Take my money and give me the huawei p100 pro

2.1k Samsung paid writers back to  work

How do you listen to music on this one? Jack or wireless? And does the phone feature earphones?

I want to get one but it&#39;s not available in us can you send me link thank you

Am i the only one who&#39;s tired of the same android layout for the pas 10 years?

As long as i have the Samsung S10+ it will never be in trouble.

I here cause of the memes

If Samsung Is In Trouble Then I Think Apple Is Dead!!

What&#39;s the background music. Tell me please. It was awesome

My dad bought the p30 today and he said he&#39;s selling the s10 cuz the camera is bad

Note 10 is coming

S10 is in trouble

Apple has left the chat :

<a href="">5:21</a> when you look at the girl who was checkin you out

Watched on my new Nokia 3310

Huawei copy samsung&#39;s edge display technology....
I was going to buy an iPhone X but nvm

I&#39;m an Apple fan boy and I&#39;m thinking of switching. I&#39;m honest, Apple&#39;s camera is SHIT. S-H-I-T.

Apple: The iPhone 11 is the best phone you will ever ownHuawei: LOL that’s cuteNOTE: I do not support what the CCP is doing by the way

Is this water resistant?

yes, definetly my future phone

Quad cameras for that true 4k experience lol...I think they copied Nigahiga&#39;s Idea 

Cameras are good but the chipset FUCK!!!Not good for Extreme Gaming

Rip ×8 scope
Who mach mani

i also revewed this phonethis phone is cool.and gys tell me what is your opinion about this phone

i also revewed this phone

Screen only full HD plusIf it was qwhd it was the best smartphone in the world

omg,i

huawei copying samsug all the time lol

Love ur vids but talk about the price more please

Huawei literally the best phone maker out there right nowLooks and functionality and competitive pricing

Never going to buy a phone with cut-outs and why only 1080p, should be at least 1440 - so def a no buy!

I dont want that Chinese crud lol

This phone is something else Edit: iPhone users are brainwashed so dw about their critics

I know that I&#39;m late but just a heads up. With that loud of a speaker don&#39;t let this phone go off in your classroom.

i knew it that one day fingerprint scanners where going to be in the screens... one day cameras will follow suit

Bro give me one iPhone se bro
Unable to access your videos. A glitch in Youtube for the past hour. It is only the audio that is playing.

I bought a p20 pro when I lost my s9. Have to say, the screen difference quite shocked me. It looks so cheap it doesnt look like a flagship.. Hope the p30 pro has better, you guys might want to compare first before buying.

it doesn’t matter samsung will just be better anyway 

That night model blew my mind too

Next video :I&#39;m switching to the Huawei P30<b>with a face palm as a thumbnail</b>

It&#39;s a complete clone of Samsung just a different casing.Chinese manufacturers are popular for re-selling/cloning their customer&#39;s products and laws don&#39;t apply there.Sadly most electronic components are made in China because it&#39;s cheaper.

BELE DELPHINE is on this phone I bet 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000 dollars

Why cant android lossen the chin at the bottom?

Will Huawei take the lead and do any new phones do business?
<a href="">9:00</a> the guy &quot;ghost notes&quot; from soundcloud has literally received more views on this specific song in the last week than he had in whole lifetime

<a href="">7:35</a> that&#39;s impressive. not &quot;it has a headphone jack&quot;-impressive, but actually impressive.

im Azerbaijani yaaaay
I got a mate 10 Pro last year, if I. Had the money would love to get this,  love my phone tho, does the job,

comparison with nokia 9

hahaha, Are you clickbaiting? I just searched &quot;im swtiching to&quot; and i saw your videos.

this would be good at concerts oh my i need this

awsm

I&#39;m tempted to buy this one but it has no headset jack.

Whe4e is the headphone jack

Where could I buy this phone

I dont need that much zoom on a phone to be honest. Not like i will use it to take photos of the next blackhole. I still think my One plus 6T would kick its ass any time.

Samsung a90
if its running android I ain&#39;t buying that crappy shit

I would love to hear your opinion on Xiaomi Mi 9 Explorer Edition with 12GB RAM and 48MP+16MP+12MP Triple rear cameras, a 20MP AI front camera! Could you please do the review on that model. Cheers mate. Happy Easter!

p30 pro better than s10+

where you can actually buy DSLR for 500$ .

Why we cant have your video about Nokia 9 Pureview..?

Is it just me or should Android companies team together to make the ultimate phone?

Next video; why I ditched iPhone.

I would get it if the chinese government wasn&#39;t putting spy tech in those phones.

Trash,or Shit from China
