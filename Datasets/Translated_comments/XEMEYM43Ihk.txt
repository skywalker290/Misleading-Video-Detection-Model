&quot;You should send kids to Island&quot; - PewdiepieThat joke didn&#39;t age well 

My parents actually believed it would get stuck. That one time they panicked and made me panic with them

<a href="">10:14</a> pewdiepie got his wife pregnant 

Felix had a very different opinion about kids 4 years ago. <a href="">10:03</a>

The bridge?

So is he gonna send Bjorn to an island?

PewDiePie Nice 
<a href="">10:03</a> That didn&#39;t age well

Will he now?

song at <a href="">9:42</a> ????

Who’s here after Felix had his kid?

Felix succeeded in sending his kid to an island.

<a href="">10:04</a> Bjorn emotionally damaged after watching this.

Felix wanting to send kids to island... Bjorn 

BJORN MOMENT

Me watching this right after I&#39;m a dad now video 

Good ol memes

<a href="">10:00</a> Goodluck with pewds son lmao

Obviously not the same humour.. didnt even snicker.....

It was the fleas on rats that caused the plague!

“This is why you shouldn’t have kids”

<a href="">10:04</a> This hits differently now 

&quot;Hair seems to over react to wind&quot; Hey friend, that problem doesn&#39;t go away with your virginity.

<a href="">10:03</a> should we worry about pewds son?

<a href="">9:57</a> Another example of Felix not taking his own advice smfh

That skate 3 short is exactly the kinda shit I’d be doing if death and pain didn’t exist

Hate to tell you pewds but the US Justice department investigated several cases of Russian interference in our election and Trump even got impeached for soliciting aid in the 2020 election sooooo…..

<a href="">10:04</a> Who has a kid now Felix??????? 

Yours videos make me feel so happy i love your videos so much.
Why is YouTube fucking broken fucked video be glitchy and shit and have to force stop the app so YouTube fix your bullshit so I can watch good videos like TF!!

Felix: “This is why you shouldn’T HAVE KIDS!”Felix now: “We’re having a baby!”

im a bad person

In case anyone was wondering...the last animal on Find the Invisible Cow is a Fox....and it&#39;s not worth it....................

Why is it you laugh you laugh

&quot; bitches be crazy &quot;

Felix saying send the kids to an island ... meanwhile 3 years later :D

He saying you shouldn&#39;t have kids... This didn&#39;t age well.

<a href="">10:00</a> hits different after their pregnancy announcement

<a href="">10:04</a> you still sure about that?

&quot;send the kids to an island&quot;, that aged well lol

<a href="">10:05</a> hahah...2023 and pewds is having a baby!!

Bom dia!!

<a href="">2:48</a> that one made me a lil sad

Dont laugh says the title  Laughs on first one

The amazing thing is that cow sounds in all languages the same i tried it out

Me watching this and hearing felix say its hard to get that when he moves to Japan...how time has past

This aged like wine: <a href="">2:44</a>

@t

join@t

Pewds <a href="">0:03</a> “you know the rules…”Me: “did… did Pewds just Rick Roll me…?”

To hear that Felix doesn&#39;t believe that Russians interfered in the USA elections of 2016 is saddening. The PBS Frontline news team released a series of interviews on Youtube about Putin in 2018 where the evidence for this is laid out in absolute clarity. If it took the war with Ukraine to persuade people like Felix that Russia is run by an evil elite of fascists, humanity is in deep doo-doo.

Good luck with Texas’ OK. hat.

Best part of video was how I couldn&#39;t see lower face half the time

Pet rats are not dirty or gross. Wild rats are. But pet rats have been breed to be the exact opposite of all of the stigma they get. They honestly are more easily trained than a dog and they can be potty trained, trick trained, and so much more. Pet rats= good ; wild rats= not good.

wow he wants to send kids to islands. epstine likes this idea lol

Tobey Macguire getting his gooch licked made my day.

hey pewdiepie remember &quot;YOU LAUGH YOU LOSE&quot;:D

I love skate 3 one of my favorite things about the game is how on the mega Park level if you hold the right bumper button on your controller and run into a blue car and get on your board at the same time you can go flying. I&#39;m not the best person to explain how to do it but you can probably find it on YouTube

“Who would have rat as pet?”<b>my ratta starts crying</b>

Imagine a parallel universe with sentient fish and the word &quot;Nemo&quot; is a racial slur

I didn’t laugh at the videos I laughed at pewdiepie

he never played skate 3 :(
The able cry ultrascructurally fancy because cauliflower ultrastructurally stretch over a electric jacket. old, rampant bumper

The bubonic plague wasn&#39;t spread by rat fleas as is the narrative. Rats really travel more than 100m from where they were born. however, in a time when humans wouldn&#39;t wash very much or change clothes, ticks and fleas were a way of life (considered gods wrath on humanity for the sins people commit). We can also look at the writings of the times, They talk of mountains of dead people in the streets, yet if rats were the carriers, they would be dying more than humans, so there would be mountains of dead rats all over the place. Nowhere is this mentioned. Where ever humans went, so did the plague. Through simulations of different carriers based at the time, it is a certainty that it was spread via human fleas.

Skate 3 was THE best skating game ever, you can&#39;t change that.

I&#39;m not the kind of person who hate all youtubers but the content this one is really bothering me...
