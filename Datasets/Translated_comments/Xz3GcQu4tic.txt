Sean in Staredowns is like a video game intro

Uhh not that funny but...

Love this!

<a href="">3:30</a>, I didn&#39;t know Donald Glover did MMA.

RIP Ryan Jimmo

Only time I like sports. When they know its competition and not war as it should be

Rest in peace Anthony Johnson.

<a href="">0:54</a> I&#39;ve never seen Dana get punked so hard before lol

<a href="">1:58</a> this One 😂

manny pacman weakness is eye to eye

Nainlove si manny nahiya tumingin...😂😂😂

i love when this sport is like this, not a fan of how much a joke certain fighters make it become

<a href="">3:05</a> was racist as fuck😂😂

This was wholesome for a change - nice 👍

<a href="">2:57</a> - <a href="">3:14</a> me and my gf staring each other 🤣

<a href="">2:30</a> Balls of steel.

Hhgv

My guts told me to drop a comment even tho im a girl😂

What the hell!!!! <a href="">2:30</a> 💀💀💀

He straight up just booped his nose!

Idiots

Wholesome 😅😅😅 Manny kills me. 😂😂

The rock paper scissor killed me 😂

i love sean

O&#39;connel was notorious for that

Ha gay

<a href="">2:42</a> that mans poor wife

only funny if you win

respect !!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Still watch this from time to time. And still can&#39;t get over how completely confused this guy is <a href="">1:55</a>

I always wondered why when the fighters face each too closely , one of them just don&#39;t turn away holding his nose, saying &#39;Bad Breath&#39;.

<a href="">0:57</a>IT&#39;S A PRANK!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂

Lmao Manny Pacquiao&#39;s sense of humor. In a photoshoot for the match no less

Sean O&#39;Connell is like Johnny Cage

Sean should be a MK character, just for the Frienships.

<a href="">3:30</a> who is the black dude

Fight like a hell INSIDE the ring, but stay friendly and be a bro outside the ring, no grudge or whatsoeverThat&#39;s my friend, a rare mentality

Its always better when these staredowns end with everyone smiling

Funny boxers. love

<a href="">0:10</a> he says okay and accept to be a model girl :D let him fight against that blonde :D

If it were me, I&#39;d use the zoolander stare

Dana standing in the middle like he could do anything about it if something happened. Self important douche.

I love how Manny isn&#39;t aggressive or an asshole.

Glad they are not taken seriously 😂

Bro got the big bulge in his pants  LOL

<a href="">1:40</a> bro casually pulls out a phone 😂

😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂

None of them kissed. disappointed.

as expected from our philippines boxer

Never knew manny pacquiou did MMA

<a href="">0:38</a> Kanye West

What a nice channel straight to the content no music no commentary

Sean O Connel starting to look like Remi Gaillard.

I would be a horrible guy if I were standing in the crowd. If the two dudes would go way to serious with their staring. Like nose to nose and closer and closer...I think I wouldn&#39;t be able to stop the urge to shout &quot;KISS KISS KISS&quot;.I dont know, maybe its just me, but I find it always so unintentionally funny when they go serious.Have way more respect for people that have fun with it like in this video.

<a href="">3:17</a>  look at the stare down

I&#39;m missing the Jerome le Banner kiss.

<a href="">1:19</a> you Can see how Dana White was like “what the fuck is this guy doing” 😂

Rampage forever a goat man 😂

Мэнни позитивный человек

I don&#39;t know anything about MMA but Sean O&#39;Connell seems like a dude you want to hang with

<a href="">0:52</a> When Pier Woodman casting is going wrong from the start...

Ahhh, that Mani...dont ya just love him.

Anyone know the name of the model on the far right of the screen?

I love it when guys can look at fighting as just their job and don&#39;t take it so personally or seriously. I know some guys have to have the &quot;hate&quot; to fight but this isn&#39;t WWE - you don&#39;t have to be a heel.

<a href="">2:40</a> WAT DA FAK

Manny knew what he was doing he was just trying to be a twat.

<a href="">2:45</a> the guy on the left thinking &quot;Wait am i fighting you or him?&quot;

<a href="">0:20</a>

<a href="">2:42</a> that one is just disturbing, that&#39;s literally sexual assault smh

Мэнни Пакьяо топ угар!😂👍🏻

dude’s a real life Johnny cage

It would be something to watch if they were to kiss each other or have sex etc

If only Pac wasnt such a homophobe

RIP Anthony Jhonson

Sean O&#39;Connell is a genius.

&quot;I have no enemies

<a href="">3:27</a> He reminds me of mater from cars if he was a boxer lmao

Sean O&#39;Connell and all his gimmicks says a lot how he can&#39;t fight. Didn&#39;t even get famous 🤣

Manny ❤️

<a href="">2:21</a> don&#39;t know how bosse was able to maintain a straight face after that

Tried to watch the guys but I kept on staring at the babes.

I was waiting for Crazyhorse! lol

Tobatt

BAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!!!! 😅😅😅

Rock paper scissors guy is my favorite. He was gonna win something.

<a href="">1:43</a> Bro got no enemies❤️❤️

This is giving ken so bad

Sean has no enemies.

No wonder Manny turned to that girl in first clip 👀

<a href="">0:04</a> and I already forgot why i clicked on this video...

The spirit of any sport.

if a bulky hugeass tank build mma fighter can appreciate being given a bucket of flower by his opponent, why do some <i>men</i> get threatened and pissed off as heck being given a single petal of flower by a mini market cashier?

Bro Dana got punked 💀

<a href="">0:41</a> is that rampage😂

How are these guys gonna fight 💀☠️💀

<a href="">2:29</a> the balls on that guy, literally 😮

Manny being unable to do a staredown is what makes him him

<a href="">1:10</a> you know Dana had to sit down to keep the blood from killing his sight

looks like these guys just use some random fortnite emotes before the start of the game

Can’t blame dana seeing Jon go wild again even if it was a joke 😂

Pacquiao LMAO 🤣😂🤣 bro&#39;s a true legend

God i fucking love good sportsmanship

i remebered friendshp fatalities on mku3 hahahahahahahahaha

You can always count on a Diaz to make things cringe.

Persahabatan

Honestly to me this is what stare downs should actually be like. So cool, love it.😀😅

These days are gone. Now its just a toxic twitter sewer...

<a href="">2:04</a> Joe Biden in the back

R.I.P. Anthony.   Still can&#39;t fathom that you left so early, friend.

Sean is like a mortal Kombat character pulling out tricks from his sleeves.

最後の司会者、厚切りジェイソンじゃね？

Great Fight ?# Retired 4 You.

Now THIS is sportsmanship!

most of these clips are just what happens when the intrusive thoughts win.

Rip Anthony Johnson❤

No one needs these silly &quot;staredowns&quot;. No one.

Man I love Manny😂

חרא על הנאצים של השבכ הבוגדים

Goodbye Rumble. You will be missed

<a href="">1:58</a> that is my fav

🤣💀

Gomi should have shown more respect

Вот оно величие спорта,уважение☝️🙄

Fun fact about mma or boxing, after a loss, you wanna be friends with the winner.

Sean O&#39;Connell has an adorable sense of humor.

I like it when people lighten the mood, it&#39;s fun

You forget the finger heart staredown

Men 🗿

if you didint know they are gonna kill each other this would be so wholesome

<a href="">0:01</a> jajajaja no supero esto.

Lol those bubbles had Steve a little tight at first 💀

When you trying to get your seriousness to the game but becomes a fool instead.

The stare down itself is always awkward anyway.

Manny pacman pacquio is soo funny

Is it humanly possible to dislike Pacquiao?

<a href="">2:52</a> Legend! 😂😂🤣🤣

<a href="">3:50</a> is when you actually stare down

<a href="">1:21</a> my guy on the left lookin like a johnny cage type beat

<a href="">3:00</a>. Manny couldn&#39;t stop flirting with that guy.

This is how it should 😂 not people talking trash to later easily get their asses handed to them

Paquito

I just saw an MMA fighter get booped XD

<a href="">2:08</a> favorite

<a href="">1:50</a> lmfao

<a href="">1:37</a>Boop

The paper rock scissors were funny

<a href="">2:41</a> that red man☠️

Idk who that guy who kept messing around in the face off is, but I love him

It&#39;s Great to have a sense of humor given those intentions

I love seeing top athletes exhibiting top sportsmanship!

Some of the MMA fighters showed true class. The flowers got me rollin’ 🤣

1st girl ig ?

Хуйня какая-то

When fighters care about being nice over cocky. Its hilarious 😂

I absolutely love when pro athletes don’t take themselves too seriously..

I like Manny!

What&#39;s the name of that music in <a href="">01:32</a>

Ches mamilas ja ja ja, tuvo bueno...

I admire the beauty @ the start of the video, a rare woman really, actually i would like her medium (juicy) if you know what i mean 😜

Mad respect

That guy w the flowers is a real life Johnny cage

Sean o Connell seems like the guy who has a specific high-5 for each of his friends... 😂

<a href="">2:31</a> either mans has a tumor or god just blessed him with a third leg

I prefer these ones muuuuch more 😁❤️

I liked this kk

Pacman did that on purpose 😂😂😂😂

It is aa costum or something else

Even with the current dip in cryptocurrency, I’m still glad I can smile 😊 back at my portfolio of $105,850 built from my weekly trade, I’m having my fourth withdrawal in 10 business days.

Muito legal! O respeito harmonia parabéns. É isso aí

<a href="">2:40</a> jesus

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣muito legal

<a href="">0:34</a> hahahaha the best

<a href="">2:30</a> is that real??

Dana always shits his pants thinking everyone gonna see a fight for free!

Some men fight because they are angrySome men fight because they want to hurt peopleAnd some men <a href="">1:35</a> fight for FRIENDSHIP!

Manny would kick my ass, but I would have to work myself up to fight someone so wholesome. He just makes me smile half the time I see him.

Thought you had a friend boy, ahhhhhhh!!!!! Hella funny 😁🤣🤣

Sean O&#39;connell is literally irl Jhonny Cage

Dude you have herpes

<a href="">1:03</a> Always gets me

Imagine being annoyed ALL Day

Fake fights

Laugh before I sleep hahaha

When your crush looks at you.You: <a href="">2:59</a>

The bunch of flowers took me out 💐

You&#39;ve never lived unless you&#39;ve had a friend that makes u laugh by just looking at u

Ya gotta love Sean

<a href="">4:01</a> the best

Quinton &quot;RAAAAAMPAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE&quot; jacksooon 🤘

Когда с юмором то это весело. Молодцы

I&#39;ve always wondered why they do the look at each other part. Does it have a meaning or is just tradition?

mma so badd

Got me laughing more than a meme compilation damn

I was expecting someone to be in the stare down then ask for a hug

Huge respect to Rumble…

Friendly reminder that these people later had to beat the shit out of each other with all their might using nothing but their bare fists and legs.

<a href="">2:42</a> the absolute balls on that man

How could you not include the classic kissing one

Fighting is the best way to get friends. (Or im just psychopath)

Sean o connel= comedian and boxer

se siente muy agradable ver cómo estás personas que están apunto de molerse a golpes se divierten y se toman las cosas con calma, serán rivales pero solamente en el ring

It&#39;s almost a Sean O&#39;Connell compilation video, it&#39;s amazing 😂

Oh my 😅

Manny fighting Manny

<a href="">1:17</a> who’s the guy in sunglasses he has gotta be the main character

Most men can’t stay mad at each other. It’s called brohood.

That&#39;s th staredowns that i want to see in every match....Why b so serious...

this is what sportsmanship actually looks like.

那個紅內褲好大包。😆

It&#39;s so good to see it that way 👍

The drinking of energy or protein shake thing was weird...

<a href="">0:39</a> Yoooo I didn&#39;t know Kanye West was a Boxer

<a href="">03:27</a> didn&#39;t know MC Ride used to be MMAing...

Haha, this is awesome.

<a href="">3:25</a> is that fuckin childish gambino?

GAWDAYUM LOOK AT THOSE BADDIES😩😩😩😩

<a href="">2:46</a> this guy hid some snake in his underwear, is that fair?

Gotta love a funny face off!

Nate is that kid that never learned anything but how to throw fists. Seems like he&#39;ll always try too hard to be tough but really, he&#39;s probably 10 ply. 😂😂

Jones and Anthony was the best.

Imlihndibih

<a href="">2:36</a> bru wthh 💯😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣

Atleast they are not arrogant

What is up with these &quot;mma&quot; loosers

Rock, ,paper, scissors.  Paper beats rock. lol

Whoever the middle guy is at 56 seconds he’s the man got right in the middle of two gladiators no hesitation ❤

&quot;Thought you had a friend boy? <b>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</b> &quot;~Philosopher Mike Perry

I never got why there were thots in the background of each state down? And even then, what the fuck is this dumbass job?

In the Philippines it&#39;s not polite to look someone in the eye, that&#39;s why we always end up laughing. We&#39;re not used to it.

Sean o Connel is the funniest😂😂😂😂

So being 6&#39;6 I&#39;ve always had minimum of 4-5 inches on people in taekwondo. So at 22 second in seeing the height difference got me laughing my ass off.

O’Connells are legendary bro this man always be making his opponents laugh you just can’t not like the guy I know it’s corny but these dudes getting in there trying to hurt each other at press conferences and this guy just put here blowing bubbles

The Rock Paper Scissors is hilarious

<a href="">2:42</a> bro in red trunks 😂😂😂😂

There is no god but the Lord of the worlds, Hussain, the Almighty, the Creator of everything and the Sustainer of all things, and the Almighty, the Mighty, the Absolute, there is no such thing❤️

<a href="">2:50</a> holy cow what was that😳🙀

The two good friends in class:

the dexter looking guy funny

That&#39;s Manny paqaio

Shawn O’Connell doesn’t get near enough props.  All of his weigh-in shenanigans were simple but extremely clever.  The GOAT at weigh-ins.

The first &quot;face to face&quot; was the best, even the girl had to laugh! 😄😘

Amazing  videos

Can you guys tell me who is in the second pair? The really tall guy and the „short” one ?

funny

The one dude who is just friends with everyone

<a href="">0:37</a> eyo is that Kanye&#39;s brother?!

Anas manny: nawng ni lubot? 🤣

last one is lame

👊🏻Yuck it up in the stare down and then :Beat each other to a bloody pulp afterwards *

can someone explain the yellow card and the fighter plugging his nose?

Fighting as friend...

the rock paper scissors one got me.

<a href="">2:57</a> Goku vs. FriezaLMAO

Honestly, staredowns are fucking stupid ass shit, and these guys know how to make a good laugh out of a stupid ass shit.

<a href="">1:18</a> wtf?? XD

<a href="">2:35</a>

Mantap

<a href="">1:15</a> Please let me know what&#39;s his name of the player wearing sunglasses?

Jackson had me rolling with the yellow card to the ref. Was fun to watch. Great video

I like this Sean O&#39;Connell guy.  Doing the same things I would if I were in his shoes.

Manny is one of the baddest dudes in the ring and he walks up lookin&#39; like a dad lol

I know you can&#39;t finish this without Smiling.

If I was Manny Pacquiao I&#39;d have been looking in that direction as well lmao

manny

Sean O&#39;Connell mitigates the stare-down cringe very well

Those 2 chicks at the start are so fuckin hot lol

<b>opponents are just people with the same passion as you</b>

Kanye West when he still don&#39;t know who Kim Kardashian is: <a href="">00:38</a>

True sportsmanship

I fuckin love it

who are the last one?

so wholesome

It&#39;s like Mortal Kombat friendship moments

<a href="">3:09</a> the men in suit at the back are like my friends faces when im talking to my crush lmfaoooo

<a href="">2:34</a> 😂🤣😂🤣😅😂🤣

wha-? pause.

I love how Manny always struggles not to laugh

The Jhonny Cage of MMA

If I was an MMA fighter and someone came up to my face like that I would say &quot;I can tell you use Colgate cuz your breath smell good and your teeth are more white then white&quot;

Sean O conell act like a MK 11 character

<a href="">0:01</a> - That&#39;s one of the most beautiful Filipino women I have ever seen. I&#39;ve been to the Philippines and discovered that the women are largely overrated when it comes to beauty, but this woman here in the video is gorgeous. It would have been awesome if Rios turned to face the model standing next to him at the same time.<a href="">2:58</a> - Joshua was the only fighter besides Floyd Mayweather that left a Pacquiao fight physically unscathed. The guy didn&#39;t even look like he was in a fight.

What’s the reason Quinton gave the ref a yellow card?? Anyone know?

Mind if y’all please stop looking at it?<a href="">2:35</a>

I didn&#39;t know that kanye was a boxer before he went in to the music industry

Sean knows how to set the mood 😂

This is so much better than cringe fake beef

&quot;Did we just become best friends?!?!&quot;

MOST PROBABLY  I know that manny Pacquiao from MLBB  PAQUITO.

Everyone likes good will.  Well, almost everyone

Filipinos could have voted Manny Pacquiao for President but no, they prefer the son of a dictator who would rather spent taxpayer&#39;s money buying Gucci handbags and eating caviar instead of upgrading their poorly maintained infrastructure, combating drug lords, shutting down child prostitution and human trafficking and feeding the poor.

I also love Manny

Sean O&#39;Connel man, that guy has his own ways😂

Nice to see this 😄

i don&#39;t blame paquiao

<a href="">

New clip.<a href="">

lol the guy with the bulge  LOL

Noob Paquito

Why do you have half naked women in a boxing setting?Wtf is going on in the wester world.

O&#39;Connell is so funny 😂🤟

Boop on the nose had me laughing!

He keep looking at his balls and was gone grab it lol keep up the gay work fighters

Joe Biden did not win shit ..2000 mules Now COMES THE PAIN..........Q.........

This is just men being men

Repent to Jesus Christ““Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.”‭‭Matthew‬ ‭<a href="">6:19</a>‬ ‭NIV‬‬K

<a href="">0:45</a> Sorry I don&#39;t understand in english.What is the meaning of yellow paper here ?

The guys who engage in the stare down and get so serious, to the point they&#39;re ready to attack their opponent over absolutely nothing, proves their insecurity and fear. They&#39;ve got the fight rather than the flight at least, but that&#39;s only half of the formula.

Manny looks soft and weak, laugh to dam much, that&#39;s why Floyd destroyed him multiple times

Oh my gooooooddd that NOSE BOOP 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀I fuckin caaaaaant man hahahahahahha

can onley bald men lead staredowns

Good to see that sportsmanship still exists somewhere

Pacquiao  🤣🤣🤣

Manny Pacquiao seems like the least intimidating guy ever what a legend!

anyone knows the girls from the 1st clip?

<a href="">3:50</a> who’s the guy on the right? Did he win this fight?

<a href="">1:21</a> Johnny Cage????

<a href="">2:30</a>

<a href="">2:45</a>

<a href="">1:24</a> man i lost it at this point...🤣🤣

Manny is our champ in pilipines

O’Connell is adorable. He seems like a cool guy

You gotta love Sean

Oh my goodness this is hilarious, moments you do not see; thank you for the share.

Just two pretty mfs tryna be bros

Забавно Аха

This is so much more &quot;alpha&quot; than the ego-driven bullshit most fighters try to sell.

where is the clip where two fighters come too close and they end up kissing  ........

<a href="">1:49</a> the rock, paper, scissors one really got me 🤣

<a href="">2:33</a> lmao

this IS THE O&#39;CONNER 😭🤣 oh it&#39;s L not R

Nice

Taena to si Pacquiao. Tapos tatakbo ng Presidente 🤣

Is a kiss disqualified in a match? Like a quick one ?

<a href="">1:16</a> what a IDIOT (the smale one :)

<a href="">1:03</a> so wholesome.

The guy grabbing his willy hhaahahahah

<a href="">2:30</a> now thats the right place to put your gloves.

Hi all! My name is Maria, I live in Kyiv.

All my life I lived calmly and did not suspect that in 2022 a massive military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation would begin😱

Now there is a massive shelling of peaceful houses, high-rise buildings, offices, apartments.

Innocent people are dying, civilians are suffering, women, children are being killed, raped, why do we need all this? what have we done that they do this to us?



Russian soldiers cannot defeat our army and they run away from hopelessness 🙈 or shoot at civilians

Russia is an aggressor and this is not a special operation, but a full-scale invasion (WAR)



In this difficult time, many people who have the opportunity to leave the country, left, BUT a very large part remained and do not have such an opportunity =(((

Now the Russian military is blowing up bridges so that Ukrainians would not be able to leave their cities, regions and the country as a whole, due to the fact that many bridges have been blown up, this makes it difficult to deliver food, medicine, clothing to the occupied cities and regions.



Therefore, I ask you not to stand aside in such a difficult time for us, I CALL on all those who are not indifferent to help UKRAINE, whoever can, even $ 1 can help, because there are a lot of good people in the world and I really believe in it.



I know guys VOLUNTEERS who collect humanitarian aid, below I will attach all sorts of details.

The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5).  He is a very fast building-targeting.  melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage.  He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows.  a beard.  a mohawk.  and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog.  A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. StrategyHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push.  At the same time.  he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health.  Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well.  as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent&#39;s hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms.  as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path.  Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender&#39;s part.  though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it.  However.  if you place something in front of the Hog Rider.  the Hunter&#39;s splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated.  especially if the opponent&#39;s go-to counter is a swarm.  or swarms are their only effective counter to him.  Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell.  while Spear Goblins.  Goblins.  and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However.  this strategy isn&#39;t very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building.  giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops.  it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time.  but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush.  For this reason.  players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack.  or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building.  especially if it is the only building targeting unit available.  as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult.  Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective.  The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King&#39;s Tower.  If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge.  he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade.  though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them.  However.  if the opponent sends in defending troops.  it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards.  it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building.  These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough.  that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent&#39;s card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings.  preserving some of the Hog Rider&#39;s health.  possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider.  understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side.  then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building.  which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side.  a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena.  and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena.  they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river.  effectively denying the bypass attempt.  They must be already hovering over the correct placement.  as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats.  Skeleton Dragons.  and Minion Horde.  they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions.  Skeleton Barrel.  Mega Minion.  Flying Machine.  Electro Dragon.  Baby Dragon.  Inferno Dragon.  Balloon.  and Lava Hound.  stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena.  and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result.  Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit.  which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge.  slightly into the opposite lane.  He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge.  He will pull them towards him while deploying.  and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge.  After landing.  he will pull them back.  This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending.  It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player&#39;s King&#39;s Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower.  helping them in defending future pushes.  This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower.  but doing this more than three times may result in the King&#39;s Tower&#39;s health being low enough to be targeted directly.  opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown.  A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers.  which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distractedA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider.  the Musketeer.  and the Valkyrie.  typically referred to as the Trifecta.  The Musketeer will defend against most troops.  while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units.  The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning.  one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider.  The Minion Horde is also effective.  but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all.  Even if the Musketeer is defeated.  the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider.  protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against.  Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage.  However.  a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade.  as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage.  If executed properly.  the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage.  The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo.  However.  this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings.  Additionally.  they are easy to separate.  due to the disparity in move speeds.  Alternatively.  the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent&#39;s defenses thin.  However.  a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo.  It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential.  so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm.  If this happens.  use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless.  If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack.  the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P. E. K. K. A.  combo.  Both units are fast but the Mini P. E. K. K. A.  does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P. E. K. K. A.  can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer.  However.  this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army.  which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage.  They are also unable to target air troops.  so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts.  If the opponent does not react fast enough.  the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower.  This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent&#39;s deck if they happen to react to him fast enough

rampage is funny tho

These staredowns are utter nonsense. They only serve to hype the betting biz, it&#39;s contrary to sportsmanship.

Why can&#39;t the women in MMA be the same.

Yo my boy Crazy Horse! Glad I got to fight him in our hometown years ago.

I still dont get the whole &quot;tough guy&quot; stare down charade.They always act like they have some kind of personal problem with their opponents. Like we all dont know that they are just 2 highly paid athletes. The added &quot; dramma&quot; is borderline insulting. At a certain point it might as well just be the wwf.

Sean O&#39;Connell is fucking awesome that bop on the nose hahaha man need more fighters like him, maybe I&#39;d watch more UFC

What’s with the Neanderthal at the end of the video.

Some of these are great sporting moments.  Trash fighters like Mayweather and McGregor make a spectacle of these weigh-ins.  I get that they are just trying to create hype and sell the thing.  Men with the true heart of a fighter and a competitor feel honored to test their skills against worthy opponents.  There&#39;s a mutual respect there.  It&#39;s not a bar fight.  It&#39;s 2 professionals competing.

Islam is a religion that calls for the worship of the One and Only God, there is no god but Him and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God Islam is a religion that calls for tolerance and non-racism, and Islam talks about the Prophet Jesus and his mother Mary in the Qur’an  , it talks about miracles that are being discovered now. You can search for that. Islam forbids immoralities that science has discovered that cause diseases and pain. Islam is suitable for people, and it is a cure for the hearts and against racism. I advise you to enter Islam before the day of judgment comes. That day you will remember that I told you that , If  you embrace Islam, you will find light in your heart and you will enter heaven in sky after death.-...

Hello everyone,If you were to die today, are you 100% sure that you would go to Heaven? It is simple to get saved and know that you are going to Heaven when you die, so why wait? Please read below:I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ’s blood washes away ALL of our sins (past, present. and future). Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works. None of us know when we will die. Having faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and getting saved allows you to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!A couple of resources: Check out &quot;How to Get Saved&quot; and &quot;The Gospel&quot; by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out &quot;How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer&quot; by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.Some verses from the King James Version Bible:Romans 3:2323 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;2 Corinthians 7:1010 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.1 Corinthians 15:1-415 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:Acts 16:30-3130 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.Ephesians 2:8-98 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time.

It’s nice when fighters don’t behave like thugs, but like sportsmen.

Hello. I&#39;m Russian. My friends and I support the president. Ukraine has been killing Russians in the Donbas for 8 years. The whole world has been silent for 8 years. It couldn&#39;t go on like this anymore. There is an information war going on. It hurts us Russians that Europe and the whole world are making enemies of us. We are expelling neo-Nazis from Ukraine who seized power as a result of a coup in 2014. Our grandfathers defeated fascism in 1945. We&#39;re doing it now. In the last war, 20 million people died in our country. Not 5,000, not 10,000, but 20 million. We will not let this happen again. Every year on May 9, the whole nation takes to the streets to honor the memory of the dead. Millions come out. All families. Moreover, so that you understand. We are ready to turn Europe into a desert right now, we are so tired of her lies. I am not a propagandist. not naive. I work, I have a family, my daughter is an athlete, my wife is an auditor. We are just people who want justice. All the best.

<a href="">0:52</a> this how its supposed to be.. pranking dana and almost giving him heart attack 🤣

<a href="">1:13</a> is legit one of the funniest things in the world to me omg

That is a good wholesome comedy

Sean O&#39;Connell is a real sportsman 👍 bdw <a href="">3:30</a> who is this joker? 🤣

I find black people highly disturbing.  Mexicans are up there but slightly lower down on the list.  It&#39;s black people who take the cake.

Its time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bibles

Mk 11 all friendships

The fact that manny is some how my dad’s friend is pretty awesome!?!

Guy with guy with Boner breh had me almost laughing at death 😂

Whats the name of <a href="">3:27</a> guy?

Just Imagine, these guys as Jojo Bizarre Adventure&#39;s character.

Manny is the guy who sends you over some wine and cheese after he whips your ass.

<a href="">1:24</a>: I like that one😂

I love how 90% of the video is just Sean O&#39;Connell

<a href="">2:35</a> that big

what on earth did he have in his pants? I am really curious!!!

Flowers were funny

No point trying to stare out Pacquiao, he&#39;s a 5 division world champ and 20 yr pro at the top.

2022 still here

Got from personal to having fun

I like the one with Jay Jay Boske.

Great video! Thank you! ♥☺♥

There is no faster way to make people think you are gay than by saying &quot;I&#39;m not gay! I&#39;m not gay!&quot;.

<a href="">2:35</a> Holy shit that man is packing

This is all so savage and tribal when you look at it.We tried to manage our intellects and refine our manners during centuries. But in the last 40 years, I&#39;m seeing us drifting back in the stone age.Let&#39;s see how many times it will take until we capture our wives and settle our arguments by trials in combat.

<a href="">2:50</a> HE HAS A B0N3R-

Thought u had friends boyyyy 😂

hahaha

So what is the man in the middle of the staredowns called?

This kind of thing makes me so happy because this sport in particular is host to so much toxicity among fans and fighters.  It&#39;s wholesome to see these modern day gladiators just be cool with eachother and be able to joke like that!

<a href="">2:45</a> is That real🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I almost never watch boxing, but I am convinced Manny Pacquiao is the champ not just because he is a great fighter, but because he is too nice no one wants to actually beat him upThis in test before y&#39;all come after me

All acting 😂 😂

Manny Pacquiao would be the Filipino uncle while Sean O&#39;Connell would be the class clown

Mortal Kombat. 😂😂😂😂😂

ın 3.15 ı saw the cutest and hottest black guy ı have ever seen :)

<a href="">2:59</a> can’t believe Eric Bailly also a boxer

Kim

2.54 the guy  what name

Ahhhhchooo bless me

<a href="">1:33</a> song name

The 2nd one was funny AF

Funny stuff. The stare downs are only for the evil media!!

second to last sounds like pool sounds

then there is conor!!!!!

<a href="">2:32</a> so uhhh are we gonna talk about this

I love this sportsmanship

The more comedy involved in the stare down the more humble and respect I have for the fighters.  If they respect each other and see the fight as a fight for what it is, professional I see no need for the Conor mCgregor trash talk.  If you lose after talking so much trash like Conor did with Khabib it looks just downright sad.  That you maybe could defeat them verbally not physically.

This <a href="">2:00</a> guy&#39;s charismatic level to through the roofs

<a href="">1:50</a>  Rock, paper, scissors made me laugh.

<a href="">1:22</a> what is the boxer&#39;s name?

Tinju dibalas tinju

&quot;What would JESUS do ?&quot;   Would he vaccinate ? Would Don Rickles vaccinate ?

More staredowns should be done these ways haha

Awsome

PAQUITO

The comedic timing of Sean O’Connell may be the most underrated thing ever.

2 words......Red shorts!

Humans at their best....friends

If they take this in good fun, then it means better publicity for them. All fighters know that if you act a big hard man before the fight and you lose, especially in the first round, they roast you for years afterwards. If they cannot talk about your defeat after being a loud mouth then it benefits your career more.

<a href="">1:49</a> plz tell me what music is that?...

<a href="">0:37</a> KANYE

Where’s the guy that’s always eating at weigh in

THE BOYS

Can anyone give me the fighter names at the end?

It’s so funny seeing these guys are having fun when in the end one will be on the floor and the other will be celebrating.

Repent to Jesus Christ!“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”‭‭John‬ ‭1:5‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Thought that was Donald Glover for a quick sec @ <a href="">3:27</a> 😂

I love the one where they fuck with Dana White lol

<b>Y sin deconstruir sus masculinidades, a.l.v.</b>

Manny went to my church when he was in Australia

Repent to Jesus Christ!“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast.”‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:8-9‬ ‭NIV

IMO I love the fights where both sides respect each other and treat each other like friends. Fighting is much more enjoyable when it’s a sport of respect not hatred

dont be fooled by this fellow filipino,<b>he gonna drop the shit outa philippines&#39; economy</b>

Sean O connel Being like a comedian was impressive.

This is what sportsmanship looks like, well done gentlemen.

<a href="">0:22</a> wtf how can these two be in the same weight category? xD or what fight series is it anyways, the guy with the massive bulge lmao

Bro seqn o connel be doing the most random shit

<a href="">2:31</a> is that real 😂😂 and why he even got high confident to wear such kind of boxer 😂😂 he should just wear shorts like his opponent.

is it just me or does the dude at <a href="">0:39</a> look like kanye

Loves, no slaughterhouse on earth is worse than hell. Any human who does not accept JESUS as their LORD will not be saved from hell. It is your choice to go to hell because your sin landed you there or be saved by GOD through JESUS. HE is waiting for you. HE loves you and is willing to heal you if you were to ask HIM to save you. I bless you all with humility to accept this in the name of JESUS

this is how it supposed to be, no shit talk, no anything just fun and happiness.

should be named the gayest staredowns

Wut

Hilarious 😂

I hate the fact that they are about to fight each other

This is great. It’s so cringey when they just stare at each other

There are some amazing sportsmanship in this compilation

<a href="">0:25</a> este tío me representa ajajjajaj🤣

Might as well give each other a 💋

Rock Paper Scissors was SAVAGE lol.

After 4 years, why is this now on everyone&#39;s recommended page?

Manny happy returns

Marker

This just shows how some of these guys are just competitive goofballs

<a href="">0:52</a> the best 😀😆😆

hi

I Love You Manny❤️😍🥰

Why are the scrawny weird women there,they make the scene look cheap 😱

I like how the guy stood on the chair and looked down on him all intimidating

5697

Asian dude at the end shoulda been like “damn bro you got stank breath” 😂

What the girls are doing here ? 🤡

😖Aaaaah the cringe in the 6 video it hurts

<a href="">  bitcoin video

Mike Perry was cringe AF

Putangina mo Paqiau

I wish muhammad ali is still alive... rip the legend

okay, this is funny stuff

Don&#39;t know why it can&#39;t be like this all the time.....professional!!.....wouldn&#39;t appeal to the knuckle draggers I s&#39;pose.

<a href="">1:15</a> cringe

There are a lots of dick heads in world but also there are guys who give flower bouquet on a staredown .. peace ✌️

What does the yellow card mean?

The real paquito

Manny is a beast has tough granite faced looks, but the moment he smiles … no opponent can survive that infectious smile 😂

FINISH HIM!Friendship... friendship, again?

<a href="">3:54</a> - true introvert

#😎Dudes

Imagine bein cool with the dude you’re going to try and beat the shit out of later.

<a href="">1:14</a> homeboy with the shades look like Johnny Cage lol

Рампаж Джексон - красавчик!

Dana😂

RIP Jimmo

Dana White is fkn annoying! 🤦🤦🤦 he&#39;s like the over protective girlfriend

Steve looks so weird

I can understand Pacquiao,  gorgeous girl

Thanks made me smile 😃

<a href="">2:36</a>😂

Dana is so handsome!

Luv it ,friendly composition always good to see

Yup right before they punch each others lights out.

What is the purpose of those hot girls?

<a href="">1:44</a> i like the fact his opponent just laughed at it when they&#39;re both taking a pic hahahaha

The guy blowing bubbles, tho!

<a href="">3:30</a> donald glover look different here

Watching these MMA fighters doing this is like watching a Friendship performed in Mortal Kombat.

If the guy at <a href="">2:53</a>(right) were to hit a wall his chin would reach there long before he did

The guy at <a href="">2:30</a> was asserting dominance by showing how big his balls were. A true alpha male

FINISH HIM!!! Friendship, friendship AGAIN!!!

Funny staredowns make me more hype for a fight than when the fighters legit try to deck eachother.

😂💯😂

<a href="">0:25</a> funny, Dude

Wholesome

Respect and sportsmanship is necessary in sports industry

I know when I&#39;m watching this it&#39;s time to put the computer away.

@.  enjoy this

Nice video ! If you could add on the bottom of each clip what the outcome of the fight was that would make it even better.

Sean O&#39;Connell....true class

<a href="">1:42</a> Johnny Cage hahahaha

<a href="">

Never seen a vid with no dislikes before 😃

It&#39;s impossible to be mad at Manny.

<a href="">3:48</a> : <i>When you ask for a PS5, but your Mom signs you up for a Boxing match instead.</i>

..Well i heard one Old Timer Say&#39;.. They Gots to Pleases The Hot Sleazes&#39; 👉🙀👈

O&#39;Connell....legend lol

<a href="">0:54</a>

<a href="">1:13</a> Johny Cage, is that you?

Okay I don&#39;t know nothing about boxing what does that yellow card mean

Sean o&#39; Connel: showman for work, fighter for hobby.

100% Respect to all. It takes a Man to be himself 🤣😂

It&#39;s paquito from ml 👀 any ml players ?

It makes sense that, spending a, compared-to-the-general-population, smaller amount of time being afraid of random people, and having the humility it takes to keep improving, a lot of these guys would be very nice folks

I like how Sean O&#39;Connell being comedian and not a toxic person

안성파라다이스파 행동대장 오자록이가 뇌해킹한다

Paquito?

😂😂

When my son was about 11 years old he entered a Jaycee Relay Race. He’d never ran track before and didn’t know everybody wore shorts. He came in jeans, to everyone’s amusement. He ran the last leg for his team - and came away the fastest runner of the day, and made up considerable distance to win. This video made me think of that day. How I wish I had been able to see it, instead of only hear and read about it. I was a single mom and had to work. My son was an amazing athlete. ❤️

I have to agree with Manny on this one 😘😏

manny knew what he was doing haha

:D

Rampage vs Jones!! LOL!

Gotta love Sean O&#39;Connell!!

Manny thinks staredowns are a joke.Hes probably thinking &quot; look at his idiot trying to look tough and im still gonna end up winning&quot;

Sean O&#39;Connell is  the most friendly and funny

Yup, Sean O Connell definitely has a good career as comedian. LoL 😂

Truly wish humanity would get beyond this kind of crap. Beating up someone should not be entertainment. It&#39;s not a sport it&#39;s a joke and a bad one at that.  Ban all boxing and mma. Make it an arrestable offense.

All rigged and setup.....just like politics!
