LOL funny Pewds I liked this video yes!!!! :)

He looks like a botched 2012 Miley Cyrus
im gonna miss u during break felixu
Thoughts rom an army: CRINGE

Imagine how many people would do the same if they had the money.

Man spend $150,000 to look like someone.Me: Man I wish I had $150,000 so I could help others in need.

Pewds shot them with trabushate

he looks like kris kardashian

My face is visibly cringing so hard right now.

First step you have to be Korean NOT English

this dude is freaking out even jimin himself like how far is he gunna go until he realizes it’s disgusting lol

Vry nice

If you wanna be Jimininsted of trying to look like someone your not, love yourself cause your amazing. ...WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT BTS FANS?

Felix: <a href="">3:28</a>News Channels: «Pewdiepie says he is going to kill people who try to become like him»

I&#39;m just gonna point this outHe is a disgrace to Armys.People who are obsessed like him generally become more famous, they cause fights and start being obsessive . Let&#39;s get it straight we&#39;ve seen it in every fandom from all ages .  But it overshadows the pure love and admiration we have for these seven guys.

When his hair was black he looked lesbian

“I’m doing what makes me happy, i’m following my dreams. “If your dream is to go through massively augmenting, obvious and disgusting plastic surgery, in order to look like an artist you don’t actually know, maybe find something that will actually make you happy.

also THE CRINGE

<b>inabber intensifies</b>

Produce Kpop stars out of a treadmill -pewdiepie

He sead he loves jimin so much he hates bts bitch he no army

<b>microwaved</b> <b>RaT</b>
<a href="">12:54</a> wtf

Send him to ranch

“A twelve year old teenager.&quot;

Pewdiepie: &quot;BREAK NEVER HAPPEN&quot;<b>Everybody liked that</b>

Seeing Park Jimin in Pewdiepie thumbnail 
This is the first problem with Kpop. Setting wrong beauty standards for nut jobs like this guy and impressionable teenagers to try and imitate.

The problem is that he looks more like Jeffree star than jimin

I’m not joking he’s seriously now married to a Jimin cardboard

&quot;payed&quot;

turns out my life is pretty amazing... I have simple needs :)

I read comments,and i don&#39;t see anyone who make sense

Namjoon forgets his bag not Jimin.. duh

I heard about this yesterday and I was literally waiting for Felix to make this video

take a break already...

not seeing what&#39;s the problem, feels a bit like nitpicking

PewDiePie didn&#39;t use Dr Phil footage so he doesn&#39;t get copyrighted Big Brain
this guy looks like a girl lol

After the cheekbone surgery he looked like an ugly Kris Kardashian, and she&#39;s already ugly

Vox Media : PewDiePie threatens to &quot;SHOOT HIS FANS&quot;

<a href="">4:02</a> yes felix, minecraft episode 9

Stans triggered
Did anybody else notice that Pewds is wearing a fleece that is standard issue in the US Army?

Youre late
snapchat story type beat

Other YouTubers to their fans : “I love you guys”Pewdiepie: “you fuckers” 

I&#39;ll be the one who says it, please, someone finish with that man&#39;s existence before he puts eggs

I never thought the king himself would cover oLi LoNdOn.

&quot;Its very popalar &quot; I love when he say dat 

But Jimin is not handsome! If he had chooses V maybe I could comprend it...

PewDiePie: <b>He is plastic surgery</b>

He looks like a soccer mom in mid 40s.

<a href="">11:35</a> that guy in the middle looks like Trans John Cena.

I wanna see jimin become a British  geezer lol

That gimin guy must copystrike oile

When are you going to take a break?

this is especially gross because bts’s ENTIRE message is to love yourself. this is so not what they are about.

JIMIN: (Gets face crushed by a car)This guy: I need to look like him now!!!Me and my family of 6 : Ill do it for half price and buy a house!

LOOK AT THE GIRL’S LIPS

Ironically BTS Jimin also payed to look like BTS Jimin

17 minutes of just PewDiePie judging other videos? .. I love it !!

I love how his friend is like being condescending about him having work done yet she’s clearly has plenty done herself ‍️ like I don’t agree with the level he’s going too but practise what you preach

that guy looks like a fucking CLOWN

bts fans don&#39;t support oli. everyone hates this guy

<a href="">0:27</a> did he say gratis ???

can&#39;t figure it out where&#39;s jimin in his face? help.

Friends: I&#39;m worried about youOli: I&#39;m NoT gOnNa GeT aDdIcTeD Also Oli: Gets plastic surgery and kisses a poster with Jimin on it, acts like a Koreaboo, and buying stuff Jimin and other k-pop artists wear

That&#39;s some random gay shit

Please do a dr phill on this manPlease

I hate this man

army how we feelin?

Oli: Jimin is perfectionPewds: * GAY PANICS * wEll hEs NoT wRoNg

U are now an indian or what?? He payed = he paid

Kpoop

Bimbofication gone from wrong to worst

Pewdiepie: <b>JeSus ChRist HE’s a PotAtoE</b>

He sounds like a very nice and decent guy and I’m sad people are giving him all this hate. I know he had taken it too far but I hope people genuinely cares about him rather than giving him hate. Please BTS wants their fans to love themselves, so I hope you can love yourself without changing yourself. To Oli, thank you for giving so much love to BTS, it’s time to give some love to yourself.

pewdiepie pls they didn’t do surgery 

Just wait until this fad gets old

Bruh he looks like karen at <a href="">11:30</a>

Oli: spends $150000 to look like jimminJimmin: changes his styleOli: <b>am I a joke to you</b>

Imagine K-POP stan see this video and thought it was an attack to ARMY

He could get how many fucken surgeries he wants, but when he started trying to find out Jimin’s location and spamming tweets @ him that’s when we have a problem

Omg Micheal Jackson nose
“i’m not micheal jackson i’m jimin”no. you. aren’t.
There is so much wrong with Ollie I don&#39;t even need to give specifics. Anyone that wants to be a copy of someone else needs therapy, not plastic surgery. Just accept yourself before accepting someone else.

the girl outside the restaurant must have felt so awkward

He looks like my aunt but with plastic surgery, and she is 45

Pewds still likes BTS
I’m a simple girl.I see BTS, I clickBut hesitate if I see the man that wants to look like Jimin

Man: spends 150k to look like kpop personMe: never going to have 150k

i cant express to you how much i hate this man

I can’t even imagine how jimin would feel or does feel if he knows about this guy. I don’t know who i’m more sorry for, Jimin or Oli

Why does it look like he aged 10 years???

&quot;I&#39;m not Michael Jackson, I&#39;m Jimin, I&#39;m not going that far&quot; mhm, if you say so honey.

i got a red forehead

I saw this guy on TV a few weeks ago. His nose is pretty much nonexistent because of all the cosmetic surgery he’s had. Like the cartilage is pretty much nonexistent and he still wants it smaller. This guy is insane and absolutely addicted to cosmetic surgery

<a href="">12:00</a> he looks not younger but older

<a href="">14:16</a>&quot;This is a church, she is a priest, Jimin is God.&quot; LOL

I have a major déjà vu... Anyone else?
imagine if instead of having a bts obsession , he had a furry obsession

<a href="">8:46</a>. Imagine walking down the street and two people start screaming bloody murder just because they saw a cardboard cut out.   And then They start kissing them

I love your videos sm!! ️️ Like if you do too!! (Not doing this just to get likes just to see if people agree with me too!! )

cringe.
Raid shadow bouta copyright his intro

ZoomerNation 
I hate BTS
Disgusting little kpop stans

Last time i checked you dont need surgery for acne - felix 2020
idk man he looks like he snorts more coke then jackson and he has the face down

I&#39;m korean, and I&#39;m not even offended. The way he&#39;s bending his words, to communicate that he&#39;s white and he wants to be korean, without having to say it out-loud, is just amazing. That&#39;s word-gymnastics to a whole new PC level.

Lmao this is just Korean face

As a member of the bts we kindly reject him as a fellow member

&quot;I dont even want to relate to this person&quot;Boi if I was his mom,The heartbreak I got will kill me on the spot..But as a stranger, Imagine being darth vader with a piece of lego fix inside his boot then just walk around death star for weeks..that is how amgery I am right now..

u know it’s bad when pewdiepie makes a video about it

And this is another reason on why I hate kpop

My pee pee cry when I see your vids

So if he becomes this guy... and he has a crush on this guy... then maybe he gets to do his crush lol? This is too much.

18 year old woman

“I wanna look like Jimin”<b>looks like a microwaved white sweater</b>

Media: Pewdiepie says he will shoot and kill anybody who tries to be like him

Looks like jack frost but <b>microwaved</b>

The fact that he married a Jimin cardboard

As an army I think he is a shame for the fandom. He could be an normal army, spending money on concert tickets or merch. Just be an supportive fan like most of army. If he really was an Army then he would know how important it is to love yourself. It really hurts to see people do this to them self.Also not all Korean idols do plastic surgery, look at Kim Taehyung from BTS. Or anyone else from BTS they all are from heaven or smth :(Btw: Bts are god&#39;s.

Orrrr he threw out his previous friends cuz they didn&#39;t agree with him doing surgeries<a href="">8:23</a>

Bruh army genuinely despises him like it&#39;s rlly not okay and he needs to stay away from jimin it&#39;s disgusting

why i wanna kill myself right now?
&quot;Saranghe stan BTS&quot; AAHAHAHAHAH IM FUCKING DEAD

He looks like a Karen
*Paid

I hope he kept the receipt.

Pewdiepie: if any of you fu*kers do this to me I will shoot youMe: <b>starts dressing like Pewdiepie so I get to meet him in person</b>

<b>KOREABOOOOOOOOOOOOO</b>

We hate him
I shouldn’t be laughing so hard 

Pewdiepie: Break will happenWhat kind of break tho?

I wonder what Jimin would think about this.

I’m gonna be sick

I’m 14 : eh time to work.

This is why I don&#39;t usually say that I&#39;m an ARMY

I hate to say it but pewd’s videos are starting to get boring now

The Church of Jimin.It&#39;s happening guys!

WHAT THE HELL, THE STARTING OF THE VIDEO MADE ME GAG.

I want to be pewdiepie but I also have crush on him 

Fuck bts

But is it ok if I spend 150k so I can look like Gloria Borger?

<a href="">4:07</a> His old self looks like walmart brand Phillip Defranco.He now looks like the physical manifestation of type 1 diabetes.

<a href="">3:27</a> 
Oli literally takes the word &quot;sasaeng&quot; to a different level

hehe) And Pleasant Ildar already had this =))
Cause army are very insanetruth has been told

You know that trash movie, “The Fanatic”, with John Travolta. I think this could be where they got the idea for it.

He looks more like Kris Jenner than a K pop star

Paid*

Funny AF

Felix: drink Gfuel for insane energyThe guy in the video: no just jimin

Dr philip please watch

He’s using an “obsession” with Jimin to facilitate and hide his actual obsession with plastic surgery in general.

I love jimin and the rest of BTS to but good lord this is cringy , this is crossing boundaries

Okay jimmy
Just speaking for all the normal ARMYs out there who are constantly generalized by bad publicity like this, we do NOT consider this crazy guy part of the fandom and if BTS saw this they would be really disturbed.

r/blackmagicfuckery or else reddit vids will be boring

<a href="">0:28</a> He said free!
This is taking weeb to a whole ‘nother level.

nani!!!

But seriously where does the money come from?????

<a href="">11:35</a> he looks like women

he looks like a karen

Imagine people actually thinking he is jimin

who the fuck is bts???

My my, this was so hard to watch..

He looks like Karen
This video is DISGUSTING 

Poor guy ended up looking like Kristen Wiig

Someone said he looks like Kris Jenner

Pewdiepie: If someone of you do dis to me i will shut you Pewdipies mind: I hope someone do dis to me so i can make drama.No hateIs math realeted to sience

Rai-nord vpn!

I missed pewds thumbnail format..

People live in a &quot;box&quot; with too much money. That&#39;s sad.

Why does PewDiePie look like Taeyong

Bate barker

<a href="">1:18</a> bootleg Jeffree Star without makeup

150,000 to look ugly and it ended up looking uglier than normal hahaha
&quot;bate barker&quot;

Dude looks like an anime trap gone so wrong

This comment is from poland🇵🇱Pls Like for this comment on 1.k like&#39;s im eat poo on my channel

olis pronunciation is terrible 

“you guys ever cry watching my videos?” i mean.. i cried during the wedding video

That awkward moment when he actually looked more like Jimin before all the surgery....

ARMYS ARE NOT LIKE THAT, ALSO LIKE IF YOU ARE ARMY

Dammit I watched this video while eating and...

If you not happy with yourself you’re never be happy 

give me another terraria video please i am so hungry

Boy looks like blonde Cillian Murphey
my boy looks like he came straight outta resident evil

I didn&#39;t know Jimin spoke fluent English and was so open about his surgery, also who payed $150,000 to look like him?

Looks more like Tommy Shelby
<a href="">10:36</a>  lmfao am embarrassed for him  he loves Jimin at least learn wt u say in korean properly he wants to look like him he&#39;s obsessed with him and want to meet him yet he doesn&#39;t even learn his language

He looks like &quot;Sailorfag&quot; xd&#39;nt
Me during the entire video“The FUUUUUUUUUU-“

&#39;I&#39;m not Michael Jackson, I&#39;m Jimin&#39;- Oli London

pewds: HES A POTATOjack: A POTATO YOU SAYjimin copy: ...this was funnier in my head.

he looks more like Luka Magnotta
I don’t understand the obsession around BTS I’m confused but each their own I suppose. I personally would never want to look like anyone else. ‍️

i cringed so hard when they screamed in front of that store i almost couldn’t finish the video

150.000 that could had been donated to help Australia or me

didnt this guy marry a cutout of jimin recently???

Imagine ruining your entire face to look like a melted doll

LMAO this is gold

Wath!?!

Noel miller sent me here
I cried when water sheep died

He should learn how to love himself in the right way Stream SHADOW fellow armchairs

Change the title to<b>He paid $150,000 coz he wanted to look gay too</b>

Bruh don’t be gay get guns

omg the two best thing in one video. felix and jimin. amen.

He actually got married to a jimin pic

the moment that dr. phil episode came out, i knew we were gonna get a reaction video

I bet there will be guy like this but he will want to be Pewds :D

i wonder What happened to 1. ikea tower? fly it whit elytra

While he wanted to look like Park Jimin, he turned to Seda Sayan
You know, I was considering weather or not I should start listening to K POP just to see if it was as good as these Stans say it is, but I’m gonna give it a hard pass. I think I’m okay with missing out on this one.

He looks like that lady from SNL! Ditto!

He wants to look lime jimin, he actually becomes james charles

his name is Ali not Oil

What is that computer monitor?

Im kpop fan but this, annoys me

Bro r.... u ....ok?
<a href="">4:58</a> Me while watching porn and the dick is shown for too long!!



Aaaah fuck I'm the only Russian here!!!! Write out who is Russian ???
There are people in this world.

im an army okay. this person is not. the part of being an army is to love them and support them, to be in a community of people that communicate through music. trying to be them is legit stalker shit. no no no.

As an army i am disgusted
My face throughout this entire video: 

He looks more like ninja

These people are the reason I don’t like to share that I’m a kpop stan because some people are too obsessed and are at stalker level and it’s really not ok

He looks way worse

I never cried while watching one of your videos, but i did bust a nut oncePewdiepie is the mainstream weeb

This whole surgery Thing always reminds me of me trying to make a pretty character in games,and then when i leave the Creation menu i see this.

I&#39;m gonna get surgery to look like PewDiePie

<a href="">3:47</a> reminded me of sev&#39;ral timez from gravity falls lmao

He... Legally married a cardboard cut out of jimin..

the blond guy from the second group of friends, I hope i see him on r/fuckmyshitup

he&#39;s face has a enough plastic to fill the ocean

<a href="">10:34</a> they love you because you give them a lot of money

He went full on different race 

Imagine this man being drafted in Britain for WW3.

PewDiePie: „He looks like Plastic Surgery”

ah yes because 12 year old girls all want to surgically modify themselves to look like a korean man.......

ppl who take drugs fills good that doesn&#39;t mean its good for you

Nord VPN I use in pubg lite pc :)

Wait shit, isn&#39;t his blonde friend at <a href="">10:20</a> that frenchie from Rock of love lmao

Talk more swedish

He really does just striaght up looks like micheal Jackson

none of the armys like him, they&#39;re trying to report him to BTS&#39;s company so they can take legal action. the clown himself fckin married a cardboard cutout of jimin in vegas recently and in response to the backlash he was like &quot;don&#39;t be cardboardphobic to me&quot; 

&quot;If anyone of you F*ckers does this on me I&#39;ll shoot you in the face...&quot;This sounds like a challenge.

I don&#39;t like BTS

He&#39;s turning into Kris Jenner tho......

PHIL TIME!!!

me crying every Monday while watching (pew die pie) videos before school

I love bts a lot but damn this makes me really uncomfortable

When looks this man worseComment= earlierLike = in the future

He has the power of Jimin

how could you not mention that he married a cardboard cutout of jimin

Who is this jimmy guy he keeps talking about

I&#39;m gonna go on a limb here 

It would be hard being pewdiepie because I enjoy having legs

He looks like Michael jackson
As a bts army we dont claim him

He looks like a teenage cillian murphy in the thumbnail

Jungle cookie
The camera quality was real stinky on this one.

I feel bad I'm about to die of shame
Yes, I cry at some of your videos, Pewds. But don&#39;t worry, I have no desire to steal your skin and wear it

I WANT TO PUT MAKEUP ON HIM. I CAN MAKE HIM LOOK JIMIN WITHOUT PLASTIC SURGERY

Wow the comment isn’t a cancerfest this time

&quot;because he frequently forgets his bags...&quot; BECAUSE HES OVER WORK AND OVERWHELMED!!! And now a crazy British dude is getting surgery to look like him i get pissed off when people say I look like X celebrity... I literally died my hair Black so people would stop saying you look like ... The person they said.

Pitiful lol.guess he didn’t care for the way he used to look.  Sorry to hear about your wife’s robbery.....concealed carry 

wasn’t he obsessed with Taemin not Jimin?

(<a href="">9:01</a>-<a href="">9:04</a>) &quot;I wonder what BTS stans think of him.&quot;As a BTS stan I am disturbed and horrified by his mindset, I think to a point it&#39;s okay to appreciate idols looks but it&#39;s evident he&#39;s BEYOND that point. I&#39;m sure Jimin knows who he is and what he&#39;s trying to achieve. Imagine someone trying to become you, I&#39;d feel violated...He is our fandom&#39;s nightmare.

<b>onionHASayeOH</b>

Bro why do white people go too far with everything

He looks like Cillian Murphy

Try not to cringe Tuesday is back on the menu bois

I laugh at his misery.

ah, you can really dance~

how do these ppl earn money tho , i always wanted to ask that

all of these people (literally all of them) that spend a fortune to look like a celebrity, never look like the celebrity

Oli: <b>Spends money to look like Jimin</b>Everyone: “Wow didn’t know axolotls could be Korean.”

He looks like Detox SO MUCH
he looks like 35 y.o korean woman.

Oli creeps me out. I also feel bad for him because he clearly has serious self-love issues and an unhealthy obsession. He needs help.

k-pop bug is the best description of the whole culture around k-pop :)

<a href="">3:33</a> rubber bands can be an option. They&#39;re devistating. They can eliminate countries, obliterate masses, and snap people out of existence.

As Papa Franku once said &#39;Weaboos are the disease of this world and must be killed&#39; and right now I see why

Felix: I wonder how do BTS stans think of himStans: Let me introduce myself

Russia, what can I say...
watching this while eating my cake was a bad idea.

Why am I always late

Jesus ChristIt&#39;s a potato

but pewdiepie, remember when people copied your hairstyle when you dyed your hair white? And remember when you dyed your hair to look like BTS? So technically you should shoot your fans AND yourself for copying each other.

noel been clownin on this fool for almost a year now

I’ve never wanted to punch anyone as much as this guy

Nope.

Oil: <b>spends his money to look like Jimin</b>

Jimin’s friend: “Hey you look like iCarly”
Jimin might lose his singing skills due to that guy

Kpop more like gaypop
I think he&#39;s pretty gay

Honestly looks like a young Ellen ‍️ I’m sorry it had to be said.

He looks like an old fucking rich lady who overused her skin products.

I want to look like a swedish

I will pay 150 000 000 $ to look like Felix

Let&#39;s hope you never have body dysmorphia, pewdiepew - you&#39;d probably feel a little confused about your reaction to this video.

I’m pretty sure balarke made the same video

he looks like kris jenner now

he looked like Paul Dano before
It’s funny that the reason I’m an ARMY is because of Pewdiepie’s kpop video he did like 3 years ago

Locals     BTS fans                    disliking     Oli London

damn i wish i had a job, i want nord vpn
<a href="">10:25</a> Pewds is NLE Choppa confirmed

I feel like this man doesn’t know he’s gay

Jimin looks like a fukin girlI&#39;d rather look like henry cavill or chris Hemsworth

He looks like Billie Eilesh
Kris Jenner do be looking kinda fresh doe 

THE COMMENTS ARE FUNNY AS F

Bts Stan’s are nice the ones ppl know about are toxic Stan’s, koreaboos, or sasaengs.

STREAM INTERLUDE: SHADOW

&quot;A 12yr old teenage girl&quot;  
“The church of BTS” That’s what I am thinking BTS fans ate worshiping them to a point of stupidity. It’s really sad they need help

BAIT BARKER

I’m not addicted.... BUT

I think this is the most cringe i&#39;ve ever experienced within 17 minutes.  You have defeated me Pewds.

kpop is retarded

felix&#39;s love for jimin is showing

Noel Miller reacted to this same video lmaoo

<a href="">1:44</a> She tried to smile  she has the face of regret

I&#39;m almost completely done with my transformation to look like Dolan Dark. My hero!

HE MARRIED A CARDBOARD CUTOUT.

This is actually hard to watch... I dont even want to roast this guy

Please watch ARMYs reactions to him. It&#39;s literally sasaeng behaviour, so disturbing

I need to get surgery to look like pewds.he promised to shoot me

He also got recently married to a cutout of the BTS guy.

Like ve you are  of  USA

Pewds: do you ever cry watching my videos? Me: <b>the proposal video, the wedding video, the 100 million video, the donating to 9 y/o in India</b>

looks like a Julian Assange makeover

<b>so this is where jimin sat</b>Also oli: <b>wears the same pants for the rest of his life</b>

Tell me he doesn’t look exactly like the main guy from Corpse Bride

Funnily enough, he prolly got less plastic surgery than the guy himself.

This is such an old video why did you just find it now

Imagine if Jimin got a restraining order on Oli lmaaoo

I’m a Stan...And I just feel so sorry for Jimin...

He looks like an ancient witch that uses magic to look young

and he actually marries jimin&#39;s cardboard

i wi ll give him props for looking like scarlet johanson and nicolas cage

This guy looked 10000 times better before he wasted 150k

&quot;Do You Guys Ever Cry Watching My Videos&quot;Jöergen,Water Sheep,Boat Sheep:Allow us to introduce ourselves.

This is 100% going to be picked up by the media

Sorry pewds but its not &quot;payed&quot; its &quot;paid&quot; :/

He  looks like Cillian Murphy in anime

Omg is michel jackson! Omg! Heeehee hee heee

He looks like a 40 year old mum who feeds her kids essentiall oil

DR. PHIL ITS HAPPENING AGAIN

BTS and Jimin: Love yourself! Accept yourself!Oil: nah bitch I&#39;m finna be you :)))

The imitation is also in his small pp

AT <a href="">8:49</a> felix&#39;s face  HAHAHAHHAHA
STOP WHEN HE KISSED THE BTS STANDS TOO MUCH CRINGE

So much youtubers trying to get people to either hate kpop or make it look bad, I mean they TRY SO HARD. At least pewdiepie doesnt..at least not as much lol

i didn&#39;t see his face in the thumbnail, didnt realize it was pewdiepie lol

great idea, lets send all the bts stans to iran since they are an army :3

Oli trying to look like Jimin is like Obama trying to look like Trump, it&#39;s not possible, and it wont even look close

Nord=Trash

He neither is the BTS fan, nor Jimin&#39;s fan, he doesn&#39;t know shit about them, all of his actions are off for the sake of money, fame, and because he is obsessed with plastic surgery as well, he just had to choose someone popular to get on his name and to pulls attention. And Jimin was his pick.

JIMIN?!?!?!

PewDiePie: If anyone of you fuck*rs ever do this to me, I will shoot you in the face.

This entire comment section is r/rareinsutls material

Bro you should roast BTS....

I wonder how he would look like in 10 or 20 years.

Michael Jackson’s about to come up from his grave and teach this guy a lesson in plastic surgery

He&#39;s gonna look like Michael Jackson
How I think of oli London creeps me out.. . Tbh I wish he was taken out like....   but I&#39;m a hard BTS stan and I feel so uncomfortable about oli London I don&#39;t like him we also need to keep jimin away from oli London.... .

Well that&#39;s fucked up.

Bts stans are the worse stans period. They are just raging in every conversation bout music and let alone racist

It&#39;s kind of weird how so many Asian people try to look more European through makeup or surgery and he tries to look like he is Asian. Almost like all these people aren&#39;t happy with the &quot;race&quot; they were born with

As a bts Stan (ARMY), we fucking find him cringe, a whole Koreaboo, we don’t like him at alllllll

Paid*

Cringe , stop it , can&#39;t take anymore

Rare footage of poods saying the letter j

imagine if he met jimin and got told to fuck off

speaking for all bts stans, we hate him

I need money donated to get surgery to look like Felix, his wardrobe and his house/wife. Thanks.

Um... ok

&quot;He&#39;s like 12 year old teenage girl&quot;Pewdiepie-2020

Why it isn&#39;t 399 per month?

Btw, what&#39;s that shirt you&#39;re wearing and while we&#39;re at it, trousers, socks, undies, and shoes. It&#39;s not like im gonna dress up like you just wandering. 

* next video *Guy spends 399,000$ to look like pewdiepie

I feel so bad for Jimin ️️
Why do people like BTS in there first place there just a bunch of Asian dolls makes trash music videos and making lyrics that give me aids

The friend is Angelique from Rock Of Love

THIS IS PAINFUL TO WATCH PLEASE

why do i whach this

amazing transformation to Kris Jenner

wait did Felix just say that kpop idols take plastic surgery-

after the chin surgery he looked like a typical manager calling mom

pewdiepie is my inner attitude. Lol hahaha

This is just Phil review, but without the Phil

But did he meet Jimin? That&#39;s what we want to know!

I wonder what would happen if someone said “you look like jun kook”

Am I not getting the deal of kpop I like Japanese music and Stuff even tho it&#39;s Korean stuff but don&#39;t feel kpop music it&#39;s not all bad but don&#39;t think it&#39;s something to idolize like some do.

I don’t think most people realize that k pop starz all of them get facial surgery to look Caucasian. They fuckin get eye flaps because they don’t have when born

As a BTS fan, we don’t claim this creepy man :)

Who likes bts has small pp

He got that Michael Jackson nose

this dude is so grosss

Yo Pewds there&#39;s  this guy named Felix fjellburg  or somthin how much money do u think he paid to look like u cuz DAMN ur identical

PweDiePie should play a horror game just for old time sake.

Who is here in 2025?









In 6 years I will be the top comment...

EMBARASSING

Gratis

Kpop stans worry me.

From an army:BTS&#39;s core message is to love yourself and changing your looks completely to look like another person is the exact opposite of the message they are conveying. And they wouldn&#39;t be happy knowing that a fan is getting surgery to look like them

<a href="">2:09</a> &quot;He&#39;s like a 12 year old teenage girl???&quot;

Sooooo he looks like a 40 year old Karen that dresses weird.

dont give him clout bruh

Hi i want to be pewdsI have a crush on pewdsPewds ummmmmmm. No

Is it just me or do you like the way pewdiepie says popular

<a href="">3:28</a> <b>9yr old me starts printing pewdiepie’s face and going to doctor for a facial surgery</b>

I guess we&#39;re in the future now

Lmao kpop stans seriously need mental help why tf would you obsess like that they fake tho 

Hate bts

&quot;I dont have gun but i&#39;ll figure it out&quot;

<b>BTSlover (10yr old girl has left the chat)</b>

&quot;It&#39;s like they are in a church and she&#39;s a priest and jimin is god&quot; It&#39;s not &#39;like&#39; that, It&#39;s EXACTLY that.

This guy is a fuckin loser people like him should be broke

He’s turning into Noel Miller

One questionWTF
Pewdiepie: <b>Bape Barker</b>Me: wait, what?

They don&#39;t love him, they just love his money

I have spend 1 Million to look like pewdiepie

Noel Miller did it first

Pewds, trust me on this, the majority of us BTS fans (army) don’t like this guy whatsoever, you can see it for yourself on Twitter, we hate the fact he’s trying to look like someone he’s not and especially someone we look up to

his lady friend with plastic surgery looks like the fish from the pufferfish meme...rofl that look on her face when he tells her about the surgery

&quot;I AM ARMY!&quot;U.S Millitairy &quot;Good... Good...&quot;
I cried when I watched Congratulations

I felt so sad in this video. I seriously felt like this was a self-harm promoting guy. I don&#39;t know how else to word it.

koreans: are doing everything to not look like koreansthis guy: I WANT AN ALMOND SHAPED EYES!

&quot;12 year old teenage girl&quot;Ok then Felix...

too much cringecan&#39;t watch

No pewdiepie the army do not support this idiot 

Well... he REALLY didn’t get the ‘Love yourself’ concept

Lol i stan bts jin and half away to his face but i never gona do plastic surgeon just like her=gay

army does not approve this man

Pewdiepie:if any one of u fckers do this on me?! I&#39;ll shoot youAlso pewdiepie: I don&#39;t have gunsMe: did you mean guts?

How can someone have so much plastic in their face?!?!?

He looks nothing like jimin

Could somebody pay to look like Felix

<a href="">4:44</a> IS THAT K-K-K-KKK---KK-KAPPA!?!??
I wanna hear H3H3&#39;s thought on this but idk if he can after being cancelled lol

Everybody KNOWS THAT

As a Christian i can confirm god,jesus and mary are very disappointed in giving plastic surgery to humans and releasing this man into the world

Not gonna lie..i skip every second that this guy talk to his friends and talk about himself that SO OBSESSED with jimin lmao‍️

If he could he would stalk Jimin every day of his life.

<a href="">10:19</a>That face says it all

Yes

i was waiting for this

I actually have a ring like that  but I don&#39;t wear it

Also yes he is pronouncing basically everything including Jimin wrong which is absolutely hilarious 

what the fuck

I- as a fan if BTS, SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THIS MAN. Imagine being Jimin, and just seeing oli. It must be embarrassing for him, seriously. and even worse, now he has set his eyes on Felix from Stray Kids. Someone save my baby from that thing! As a STAY I’m just terrified and concerned 

why is pewdiepie giving this guy more attention...

At <a href="">11:30</a> the guys face looks like Gordon Ramsey

Now he is finally famous he made it in PewDiePie video

40.000 plastic surgeries to look like Sharon Needles.

He looks like a grandma
alt universe bate barker

My comment will probably get lost, but does anyone know the beat playing in the background at around <a href="">16:30</a> ? So annoying hearing some cool background beat and there&#39;s literally no credit given ever. :(

He went from Korean to middle aged women in a couple of surgeries

&quot;I don&#39;t have guns so I&#39;ll figure it out&quot;Happy trebuchet noises

I like V I find him the prettiest among all BTS. I don&#39;t get people&#39;s obsession with Jimin. Also I don&#39;t get Oli London&#39;s obsession to look like him while looking like a corpse bride.

Pew: Will shoot u if u buy something, just because pewdiepie have itAlso pew: sell his chair so other people can have the SAME chair

this was one of the most cringe videos ever xD

Owo

I hate this kpop tryna lookalike more than i hate kpop and goodness me i fucking hate kpop

BEAT EAT HEHE!
He looks like a woman.

I hachu Ollie I fucking hachu Ollie I hachu for coming out with that flaw up your fucking fatass

fuck no, I wouldn&#39;t pick a female looking man. Perfection is David Beckham 

ARMY supports pewdiepie !!

Technically it&#39;s a illness called obsession and it needs to stop. Im talking to you k-pop fans

Did he said Gratis?

&quot;I&#39;m not Michael Jackson, I&#39;m Jimin. I&#39;m not going that far&quot;...   yetLmao

PEWDS...I WILL BECOME YOU

<b>i wanna be him, but I also have a C R U S H on him</b>

lol wasnt nordvpn in a lawsuit for selling users info LMAO

WHERES MY ARMY AT?
Am need some holy water

I have a feeling one of these days this ollie dude won&#39;t be into kpop anymore and he&#39;ll look like a kpop dude

Go away kid.. 16+ swear

Terraria part 7Pls

Oli looks like the corpse bride if she was trans 

Hehehehe. idk.
His profile kinda looks like Kristen Wiig <a href="">12:01</a>

what the fuck is even that

He &quot;PAYED&quot; $150 000 to look like BTS JIMIN-Felix

He thinks he looks 18?! He looks like a middle aged woman!!

Ngl I cried when I watched “congratulation” music video when Felix gave a bro fist.

Why was this video made?

some armys like to watch pewdiepie too ^.-

It&#39;s funny that he almost said raid shadow legends cause they&#39;re both as bad

To look like Jimin he would have to look Asian AND HE DOESNT. This is just sad.

yayyy
it wouldve costed less for him to look like katie hopkins

HE MISSED THE WHOLE POINT OF BTS PREACHING ABOUT LOVING YOURSELF SMH

<a href="">11:00</a> Damn im sorry but he looks exactly like the smart titan who&#39;s always with the beast titan omg

Can&#39;t handle cringe, can&#39;t handle cringe
Any pewd clone : but i just wanna grow some beard <b>boom</b> headshot

JIMIN DOESN'T HAVE ANY SURGERY ON HIS FACE, EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS NATURALLLLL....
DONT SUB TO ME

How does he afford to do this ?

what oli is doing is not okay in any way. he is defaming jimin and making him look like some manufactured idol like both him and dr.phil has mentioned, when oli is the manufactured one. i feel so bad for jimin and for armys because this gives us both a bad image :/

What a wast of money

Tries to look like a korean.. actually looks like Michael Jackson..Natural selection needs to take over..

I can&#39;t do that because I&#39;m 19 and overwhelmed by student debt

thumbs down for BTS

Sub to lunatic base

As an Asian I always thought that we do the eye and nose surgery thing to look more Western, like bigger eyes and higher nose. Seems like I was wrong =))))))

This is cringey to call it cringey.

<a href="">10:15</a> why does that look like an old version of Laura lee 

Jimmii he is always forgetting his bag.

I wanna look like him.JUST JOKING.
i cant understand him, i mean im trying but i cant. Even though im an old army, he makes me wanna leave this fandom for a long time

SUB FOR A BURGER AND A MILKSHAKE

Buddha.exe can’t find enlightenment
A comment that hasn’t been reposted 100 times or is a quote from the video

I feel bad for that random guy he goes up to

the fact that I watched this on dr phil yesterday is worrying

I don&#39;t know about bts but their fans are so cringe 
All that money to look like Kristen Wiig.

<a href="">3:28</a> hekebehje I WASNT READY 
The looks like Aunt Jemima, but white.

i look like jimin<b>No, you look like karen</b>
Damn! The girl look like 13 years old tenage girl..Pewdiepie how can she use alot for that

omg i love my life, pewdiepie doing a video about oli london :0

Okay but Jungkook is the lead vocalist

How tf can these people afford these expensive things?!

Can&#39;t wait for people to start paying money so they could look like felix

I want to copy your face mr.pewdiepie.

Looool actually on twitter recently there has been a petition going around amongst ARMYs to somehow stop this guy

<a href="">12:55</a>  a ring of jimin lol<b>&quot;&quot;Oli london married with a cardboard of jimin&quot;&quot;</b>èwé

I&#39;m suffering
Who is paying for this guys surgery?

Why does sane society entertain this behavior? This, in any other era of history, would be considered a profile for a serial killer. Stay as far away from people like this as possible, or they will wear your skin on their face at some point.

Pewdz : “Anyone of u f**kers do this with me I will shoot you, I don’t know how but I will figure it out.”That one guy : <b>Sad pewds fan noises</b>

army hates this man with a passion

C R I N G E

Wants to look like a Korean man in his 20&#39;s.Ends up look like a Caucasian woman going to her 40&#39;s.Moral: Educate your children to accept their body and stop giving them all they want.

Gratisss

I literately just cringed trought the whole video

It&#39;s so sad for me that people are starting to hate BTS because of that stupid behaviour of Oli and others. It&#39;s getting too far and anyone who is capable to see it is making fun of BTS. Even though they didn&#39;t do anything wrong and don&#39;t deserve all of this shat

I don&#39;t know but this was kind of sad. Just imagine identifing so much with a celeb that you lose yourself. Very sick and sad

When you know that matel made BTS dolls, so he more than likely bought half of the stock and now has Jimin voodoo dolls and shrines all over his home.....

I liked the video koz of the LEEFY JOKE

This was hard to watch.

Isn&#39;t he the guy that wanted to look like britney spears?

freaky ....
Pewds!!! Go to Korea! For the food. It&#39;s bomb!!!

I am disappointed. F

Jimin needs 24/7 protection Oli seems a bit too obsessed...

He can do whatever he wants, but this is funny xD

Hello, a BTS ARMY here. I really wish this guy never meets Jimin. All he&#39;s gonna do is make Jimin feel uncomfortable. You didn&#39;t talk about this but recently Oli got married to a cardboard cutout of Jimin in LA. That&#39;s some major obsessive behaviour. He takes that cardboard cutout everywhere, he eats with it, sleeps with it, kisses it on the lips - I&#39;m disgusted! He needs help. Being a stalker of and obsessed with a living human being is NOT FOLLOWING DREAMS. Please stop this madness. Hope Jimin NEVER finds out about his existence! BTS’ new album 7 is gonna release on 21st February and the lead single will be dropped on 15th Jan! Don&#39;t forget to check it out, everyone! 

when i read the title i thought he was james charles..

he literally married a cardboard cutout of jimin like,,, tHATS CREEEEEPY

Its confirmed stars are made out of treadmills <a href="">3:52</a>

Im telling my grandson that this was jimin

At the end He looks like the Monster I was scared of in my childhood

Just one word eughhhhhh!!!!This makes me cringe so far that my non existent kids feel as crippled as I do

This is the complete opposite of BTS’s message.....

He looks more and more like M.J and thats a fucking insult....

cultural appropriation at its finest

I can&#39;t even finish the video.....

I miss Leafy!
I feel like this man doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s gay

WHAT THE FUCK

i feel so sad for jimin 

Past tense of pay is paid, not payed.

Stan.

<a href="">10:24</a> lookin like jar jar binks
he reminds me of ozzy&#39;s wife

Omg its the actual bart baker÷

He became a frickin 40 year old woman

SUBSCRIBE TO LIL VART PERF

He looks more like my aunt rather than Jimin

Raid shawdow.... VPN

I&#39;ve somehow made it this far without ever hearing a bts song

lol it looks like luba hi dooku hi is pinken english
He looks like Cilian Murphy
Oli: to me Jimin is perfectionFelix: well <b>gay panics</b> he&#39;s not wrong

Ok since Im a Korean can i try that?

I know it&#39;s a shit move to talk about looks like this but he honestly looks bad af imo, as Felix said he looks like &#39;&#39;plastic surgery&#39;&#39;. I never understood how most of these people don&#39;t see how deformed they actually look.

So it&#39;s like a blackface but korean.Wait, it&#39;s not?Huh...

Just so you know, kpop stans hate this dude so don’t come after us for this one ppl in the comments

Now that I look at it the dude looks more like Pewds than Jimin

Is this really what this channel is about ? Mocking marginalised and stupid people like reality-TV shows do it so well ? This is one of the things why we don&#39;t like TV. Don&#39;t become like them please.

When Pewds can’t do a reaction to him on Dr.phill cuz he won’t get monetized

kinda stole a video from james marriot tbh...

<a href="">3:48</a> bts haven’t had plastic surgery tho

Jimin :  <b>Be Yourself</b>Oli london : <b>No, I Don&#39;t Think I Will !</b>

How to look like jimin 1st you need to be asian2nd preferably korean3rd then plastic surgery

he looks like brad mondo but in a korean version and he kinda looks like troye sivan and my gay radar says that he is probably gay ((and i wont say my gender but im into girls))

Creepy!!!!

looks like kirsten dundst
JemIhN Yes, you are a lab.
Omg the cringe

Media: pewdiepie threatens to kill his fans

I think the biggest problem I have with this as an ARMY is that BTS launched this  campaign called &#39;&#39;Love Yourself&#39; you know... And he&#39;s doing exactly the opposite. Also I feel so bad for Jimin, Ollie is basically a stalker at this point and I&#39;m doubtful poor Jimin would be comfortable with all that Ollie is doing. I don&#39;t think anyone would be comfortable.

Homosexuals are beautiful

Poor Jimin, he really did him dirty huh

if this looks weird than you should watch those girls who want to be dragons

Cultural ‘appreciation’ I burst out laughing

im kind of happy/proud that pewdiepie didnt make fun of someone without realizing this time

&quot;I look 18 now&quot; he looks like my granny hahaha

I am Groot!
Me: uploads a vid, 3 weeks later 20 viewsPews: uploads a vid, less than an hour half a mil views

Well he look like plastic bag

Fuck the cringe is flowing through my entire body

Poor jimin
Same can be said about transgenders. They will never be happy.

“if anyone of your f#&amp;@3*$ do this to me” 

I thought this was the kpop channel I’m subscribed to and I was in for a surprise.

Moist Critikal?
In news: &quot;Pewdiepie threatens to shoot his biggest fans!&quot;

Oli : &quot;I&#39;m not obsessed.&quot;Also Oli : <b>marries cardboard cutout of Jimin</b>

LOL

Oli is a freak a biiiiiig psiho how i see him

So like what if Felix is just a robot made by T-Series so they can get fame?-sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends

I&#39;ve never been so uncomfortable in my entire life 

I&#39;m scared that if he meets jimin he will try to kiss him or something and it angers me so much

Did you know he recently married a Jimin CARDBOARD? How-  How creepy- ...?

Bro there is nothing more ugly than somebody with fake lips like the person @ <a href="">10:14</a>

even after his surgeries his nose is super crooked

This man looks like the Wal-Mart version of Michael Jackson

I feel bad for jimin really  he&#39;s  a very good person don&#39;t deserve this disrespect

Mr. Kim Jong-Un, would you please FINALLY bomb South Korea? K-Pop is enough of a reason to.

Guys did Marzia have plastic surgery or it&#39;s just my impression?I think that their opinion about this type of surgery is different

He looks like a middle aged white woman yikes

i knew you were gonna do a video on him i hate this man (not pewds i mean the creepy guy)

<a href="">12:00</a>No honey, you look like a grandma... :/

Who???Cares

Dude he&#39;s so bad that even the most annoying kpop stan hates him lolHe&#39;s a koreaboo and man do kpop stans get triggered when you call them that because they think of him.

<a href="">8:34</a> me too * cries in low self esteem *

Oil: I&#39;m not addictedAlso oil: <b>does surgery to look like Jimin</b>

He looks like someone&#39;s aunt

His end result looks like the very plastic new member of the Beatles

Oli London is married now :—)

My shit looks better than his faceGod damn .

Seems perfectly normal to me.

Please stop doing the preview things at the beginning of the videos, they are annoying and make you seem like the rest of the lame and pathetic tubers

paid

BTS sucks

He looks like Bessie BusyBody from Lazy Town

Will the break happen or not I’m so confused

“You guys ever cry watching my videos?” <b>TWD flashbacks starts playing</b>

As a half Korean it kinda makes me feel very weird lokking at this boy

Payed? Wtf?

Get it
As Army, we don&#39;t claim him
He looks like Jungkookbecause BTS members will always look the same

NOOOO I WONT KISS THEIR STAND FIGURE ON PUBLIC OHMYGOD

Wow pewds what a sellout......
SUB FOR A DONUT

&quot;i look 18 now&quot;Felix subscribers becomes 9 year old: pathetic..

I don’t think pewdiepie knows that oli married cardboard Jimin 

Plastic surgery helps and is very Important!For the Doctors they need the money.

The Church of BTS is the most accurate name for the fanbase ever

Pewds: &quot;I wonder what the BTS stans think of this guy.Me, a BTS stan: This guy is so delusional smh, does he actually think he looks like Jimin? i&#39;m not even sure that he&#39;s an actual BTS fan because of all the things you could have said on why he loves Jimin is that he forgets his bag which is apparently that funny to him. Actual fans that watch their variety shows know that theres tonnes of anything else that you could have said that would have made sense. I feel like he&#39;s just riding off BTS&#39;s popularity to go viral because he is acting like weird crazy fan that actually doesn&#39;t know anything about BTS. BTS have dealt with crazy fans before and have asked for it to stop which he obviously is not respecting. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s an actual fan he&#39;s just using their sudden fame for attention.Thanks for listening to my TED talk XD

I wanna be like jiminEnds up looking like Ellen

payed

dafuccc

I remember watching this dude in Dr.Phil. I was so mad because the guy doesn&#39;t care if this hurts him!

This man iz addicted to plastic zurgeries!

i got cancer watching this.

Now he looks like anything except JIMIN

Did pewds really run out of content so he has to talk about &quot;BTS&quot; ?

Haha stinky utuber who doesn&#39;t take break haha prove me wrong rn

can we get a bate barker chain in the comments

This is why Stans should commit not exist

What did I just watch....

this guy looks like what you&#39;d expect the texas chainsaw guy to look like without the mask

even his friends are bullying him.

Just why?

He wants to be Korean so bad that he made himself look like a shitty doll plastic surgery never looks good

I want to look exactly like FelixI&#39;ll start by cutting my legs off tomorrow.

<a href="">3:28</a> 

So, does he think jimin wants to marry himself or what?

Bts after soo long

Maybe we should keep using oil for power so we can’t use it for shit like this

𝙷𝚎 𝚖𝚞𝚜𝚝 𝚋𝚎 𝚑𝚒𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐. 𝚆𝚎’𝚕𝚕 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚒𝚗𝚝𝚘 𝚒𝚝.
He just looks like a girl.

...more like Kristen Wig lmao

This guy looks like Max Payne on his old photo, but now he looks like a &quot;Jimin: China version&quot;.

He should&#39;ve went to Korea to get surgery lol

I do wonder if people like this suffer from a form of body dysmorphia

This is the first time I actually hear this guy talking about Jimin and I&#39;m so terrified and I&#39;m so sorry for Jimin that he has to live knowing about this guy...

Pewdiepie teaching us how to self love.

I got to say at least he says thank you

This one guy had met him in Korea, and asked if he wanted to go somewhere as a couple of armys, to the BTS museum in Seoul and browse kpop stores and shit and Oli London didn’t seem interested in fanboying at all, like barely spoke about Jimin. He’s obsessed with the attention more than with Jimin. Jimin is just a very popular idol so he latched onto him. This Oli just wants to make money with his mv and doesn’t care about dragging army while doing it

Imagine black guy trying to be a K pop star

Payed lmao

Jamin? I&#39;m joking dont kill me

The guy originally looks like that guy off of The Inbetweeners

Fricking t series I’m so bored with them and their copyright claims they have monopolised the whole of music industry in India .they are buying views.if I listen to 10 songs on my tv 9 of them are owned by t series. im sick and tired of them their music is pathetic and the basic tune is similar in every song no good quality music is ever produced by them make another diss pls Pewds. Genuine Indian fan requesting support.

I cry. From pp. No btw was joke

this is so painful please we have to stop people like this and eradicate everything in the world with a cringle lvl of over 9000

My god his pronunciation is even worse than he looks

It&#39;s orrible

army literally  hates this dude we don’t claim him

Weird champ

On behalf of all ARMYWe do not support this man.

I, personally being Korean, hate seeing people doing this as this isn&#39;t cultural appreciation, It&#39;s disgraceful.

<a href="">3:33</a> - That&#39;s where trébuchet comes in.

When I saw Raid Shadow Legends I was about to go like:<b>Felix, you became the very thing you swore to destroy</b>

maybe he is a spy that is trying to bland in

150 on cosmetic surgery1 you look nothing like him2 they all look the same

I didn&#39;t realize it was cringe Tuesday

its olways 70% code or not you can cancel in 1 month

<a href="">12:14</a> he looks like a fuckin grandma

pewdiepie: how can people afford this stuffalso pewdiepie:  buys a 2000 dollar phone

Finally you mentioned this aaaaahe married a Jimin cardboard ...

<b>do they have jimin flavor?</b>real definition of <b>obsession</b>

At least Michael Jackson said things that matters: human Nature, heal the world, black or white , man in the mirror , earth song and many moreMichael Jackson have heal the world charity and a record for the most donated person in the WorldWe needed Michael Jackson Rip King of pop 

Look at those lips!!! hahaha

The height of your fame...being mocked by pewdiepie

ST️️
He&#39;s been doing this since 2016. So this had been going on for a while now. I heard he was on national Korean news so most likely Jimin had at the very least heard of him. I personally don&#39;t have any ill feelings towards Oli but can&#39;t say the same for other ARMY.

as a bts stan,,,,,,, we do nawt want this man.. we want him to go to jail

Pewds is right when he says he &quot;looks like plastic surgery&quot;. It&#39;s like these plastic surgery people have a blueprint for what they end up looking like. It&#39;s fuckin gross.

God is disappointed in bts stans/armyAnd I&#39;m atheist

Anyone else got that pewdiepie figurines notification that is still being build

he&#39;s the reason why foreigners have a bad reputation

I just disliked all TaNa MOnGeAu&#39;s videos

He spent enough to buy me a house and still looks like eesh...

This is so uncomfortable

guy: I hate my big nose me with a big nose: <b>*cries in big nose*</b>

I&#39;m getting surgery to look like pewdiepie

*the police when they catch me with 5 kilos of cocaine *I am not addicted i am just very interested in becoming addicted

Wait until the day when he gets bored of listening to bts

Wait until the day when he gets bored of listening to bts

Wait until the day when he gets bored of listening to bts

Wait until the day when he gets bored of listening to bts

He looks like Cruela Deville
Not an armyGo back to sleep oliU look like a 12 yo teen

as a kpop fan i respect his decision but everyperson has his charm and beauty jimin have his and you have urs like dont try to be someone else be u ... and of course he was more better like pewd said then now

N

He kinda looks like cillian murphy
GUYS I SWEAR ALL KPOP STANS ARENT LIKE THIS!!!! WE DONT WANT HIM HERE WE ARE SUFFERING HELP US

“12 year old teenage girl” nice one

As a BTS fan who is extremely normal, I think this guy is absolutely insane  he should be happy with his body and strive to be himself rather than someone else

Wait, this isn&#39;t cringe Tuesday tho...

<a href="">13:26</a> YouTube subtitles: the exact same restaurant that semen and bts

jimin=GOD. Decided

Ok but why does he look like jennifer lawrence on bath salts

Do you mean &quot;paid&quot; ?
I’d rather be a heroin addict than a kureen GAi boi.

pewds: if u do this on me I WILL KILL YOU!media: pewdiepie want to kill his fans

As an ARMY, I’m cringing so bad. Pls know that the rest of the fandom aren’t as obsessive

Liberace&#39;s lover had plastic surgery so that he could look more like him. That was like 60 yrs ago.

I cried when clementime shot lee in season one of the walking dead

Bearded pewds is back.

I’m so proud that I’m from Korea

I think he was kinda cute before he had all that work done

There is a difference between being interested in a culture or country and being totally obsessed that u tale it too far. This guy is a saesang Koreaboo and is just embarrassing himself

He recently got married to a cardboard cutout of jimin-

people hate bts or kpop bc of people like him and i hate it

Great. Now we wait for the swarm of bts ads

me watching this : when he got  plastic surgery :what changed lol

The moment when Kpop dies and he can’t change his face

WHERE ARE MY ARMYS AT!?!?

John: I wanna get rippedJames: I wanna get laidJack: I wanna get a decent jobDavid: I wanna be a youtuberOli London: I wanna look like Jimin

Was he under a rock for the entire Love Yourself era?

weeb shit in jahseh
People who are obsessed like this are sick. It is an obsession and an addiction. He needs a therapist.

And also married the cardboard IM—-

Guy looks like Michael Jackson
It&#39;s not (3.49)three point forty nine felix. After a decimal it is just digits so it is four nine.‍️

<a href="">3:28</a> please forgive me

<b>pewdiepie</b> and the sponsor is... RAID SHA- jut kidding! i’m kidding! it’s NordVPN<b>the worse KSI</b> they learn so well...

Is it just me or does the original man look like hashinshin?

please say he was paid to do this lol
He is not changing his race because that&#39;s impossible but he would definitely do it if it was possible XD

bruh us bts stans hate his ass and we’re talking shit ab him on the daily ️

Im an Army and this guy is CRAZY why is he doing this? He looks like Michael Jackson im sorry but its true 

<a href="">11:43</a> did he gain a extra chin from the surgery? Is that what&#39;s different?

We all hate him so much, that guy is the epitome of shit.

when are the figurines coming?

PewDiePie: &quot;They do the puffs under the eyes&quot;PewDiePie after a second: WHY DO I KNOW THIS.

Plastic surgery use to make people more beautyful, but why they all so scary?

im not addicted, but i am obsessed with koreathat like mw saying im not trying to be black, but pewdiepie bridge

<b>Make this the most liked comment of 2020.</b>

Review r/BoomersBeingFools my dude

It’s clear he’s doing it for clout, he really doesn’t know much about bts at all. He’s getting money online for the attention and views and interviews like this becouse of how insane it is. Sure he might want to look like him but It’s all clearly for the clout and money tbh

I just realized I look like my self..... My life is a lie

&quot;i think im 19&quot;what.... he is 19 years old army?

we don&#39;t claim him, we don&#39;t like him, we&#39;ve been trying to report him to bighit- sincerely, army

why the hell is he getting attention for being an ugly creep??  this world man

We dont like him tbh
The  dislike is from bts fans

from the side profile he looks like kristin wiig lol

If you like and subscribe me, i will thank you so much.

Isn&#39;t this the same concept as black face

He looks more like a soccer mom
I cringe, I lost
Due to his obsession, 30 year old man undergoes plastic surgery to look like GFUEL.Now his skin glows in the dark.

If I hear the word jimin again Imma be dangling from my ceiling

Good a fourth of the frame isn’t covered by monitor tho

Where are his parents....

Basically he is racist against his own race

Illusion 100
RAID:..NORD VPN!

This guy also recently married his cardboard cutout of Jimin.

Jesus kpop stans are insane

I require a gallon of unsee juice :)

Jimin’s beauty is natural and organic without any plastic surgery this guy looks like anything but jimin 

umm... Michael looked way better than that.

When you don’t skip the 2 ads on a pewdiepie video because he needs the money

BTS aren&#39;t manufactured and never did plastic surgery. koreans dont even consider them to be kpop because they are more sincere both musically and brand wise

Why is pewds pushing smaller youtubers out of work??? Find out next month!

He is crazy

I like your videos,who else

You can tell pewds is scared from all the BTS fans.

makes me lol and die inside cos they&#39;re always perfectly fine before and actually kinda cute and then they go and fuck it up beyond repair.

Thanks for vpn i like this for play  game.

please people try to love yourself, try to accept yourself.. its not easy but its worth it, cuz you will have healthy mind. just vibe and listen to kpop, dont let it to over take your life, its just music, chill for god sake

No Felix why??? We don&#39;t want to acknowledge it&#39;s existence.  SadI&#39;m still .. and watch.

He went from straight looking to gay looking

A healthy society would not produce men like this.... globalism and greed are making narcissists of us all.

&quot;you don&#39;t jimin&quot;
So it&#39;s supposed to be a dr phil episode

Fun Fact @PewDiePie , that guy got married to the cardboard figure of Jimin

That was the day Pewds brought BTS into my life. Are you happy now? ARE. YOU. HAPPY?!

You know it&#39;s 12.52 now when you uploaded this video in INDIA and I am it watching now and my mom is standing with a chapple!Chapple means slipper in Hindi.

If olli was obsessed with his own culture like he is obsessed with Korea he’d be a white supremacy

<a href="">9:05</a> we are disgusted and embarrassed,  currently we are trying to contact bts&#39; label for them to get a restraining order against him.

He does look like kris jenner
I hope his obsession ends soon and he won’t go even crazier when Jimin dates someone else or get married

pewds: “if any of you guys do this to me i will shoot you”media: “PEWDIEPIE THREATENS TO KILL FANS”

He is not Jimin....he is Kwang Soo....more too kwang soo...i think....maybe...

That’s the french girl from Rock Of Love right? AHAHAHAH

Bts: love yourselfOli: omG i WaNnA bE jiMiN oPpAR
i want to live Korean. Which one? North one? :D

FINALLY

pls he is koreaboo and im willing to sacrifice him as long as he leaves jimin alone pls 

69k likesLet’s keep it that way

<a href="">3:28</a> buy merch you&#39;re half PewDiePie then

If people can&#39;t do blackface he should not do Korean face

I cant watch this shit anymore i quit

I cried when yourgen died

The sad thing is that the crazy fans are the loudest. This man doesn’t even seem to be a fan of the music, just looks.

This is just like that lady who tried to look like Angelina Jolie but sadly ended up looking like the corpse bride 

Thank you, Pewds. It&#39;s good to know we all don&#39;t have to look like Jimin.

the fact that he doesn’t realize what he’s doing is racism is insane. like jeeeeeeeez dude

So he transformed from a normal man to a weird looking woman, while trying to look like a korean star... how

Random army : I love JiminGuy named Jim: ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
Stans are absolute jokes, mentaly deranged people.

I used to bring a picture of pewdiepie to the barber and ask him to do what he did.

He took the &#39;no-jam&#39; fan to a whole new level

I don&#39;t even know what mental illness this is... next video Jimin is down a well with this dude screaming &quot;it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.&quot;

Spoiler Alert: HE  F A I L E D

And I wanna be anime!!!...When I die

Who&#39;s Bts Jimin

People are messed up, you are beautiful the way you are

Hola if you don’t sub to this channel (Toxic Streams) pp small

this could be in interdimensional cable III

Pewdiepie:  do you guys ever cry watching my videos?Me: we all cried when sven died

A lot of Korean food is inspired by Japan especially after the occupation, brother and sister nation.

Omg Oli is so fucking out of his mind , sorry jimin for having to experience that honey .

He looks like the main character&#39;s avatar from Ready Player One.When we first saw him

It’s like that guy that wanted to be a gender less alien.

BTS group can make anyone gayChange my mind

I already feels bad for his younger brother (if he have it). Especially if his brother is still in the junior-senior highschool. Don&#39;t know why.

PewDiePie: Does anyone ever cry while watching my videos?Everyone who watched the Minecraft series:

He is a potato

Damnn so cringe
i just recently saw his music video with my boyfriend, and now everytime it falls quiet, one of us will randomly say &quot;olieyo&quot;

He looks horrible. He looked fine before

He looks like grampa now
How do these people get the money to do this?

WHAT THE FUCK ON THE PUFFY EYE SURGERY?! I guess I&#39;m so vogue in Korea then. I have puffy under eyes always. Not dark bags. Its fuglier then everything and if I could afford it I&#39;d have them removed. It&#39;s a genetic look thanks to my dad.

Alright that&#39;s more like it, be sure to tell him to hit between the eyes, thanks. And dng, I&#39;m jealous of that guys hair, it&#39;s beautiful.

&quot;I look 18&quot; he said while looking like one of those 60 years old women which tell you to not use earbuds or you&#39;ll get cancer

I SWEAR NOT ALL BTS FANS ARE LIKE THIS. i sincerely apologize on the behalf of every non-obsessive ARMY. Not all of us are like this, not even close. Please do not use this man as a counterpoint when arguing about BTS, I assure you 99% of ARMYs would be displeased at the comparison. HE IS ALSO NOT THE EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW! Speak to ARMYs now, DO NOT DO WHAT HE DID. It looks terrible, makes other ARMYs look bad, and makes you look insane. If you think you want to do something like this, JUST STOP!

nani?

With all that money i could buy my favorite car and tuning it

Anyone: commentsAnna May: cH ecK my N U D E S
as a Korean I can FULLY confirm that all stars have had surgery.

A dream that ARMY has Going to BTS CONSART 

LMAOO

Imagine naming your black child ‘kofi case’

Army&#39;s doesn&#39;t like him in the slightest. Everybody knows him but he&#39;s the bad side of Army. Plus can we just appreciate Felix for not bashing him but being more respectful than anybody I&#39;ve seen who made a vid on him? Thank you very much

Lowkey looking like Adele

Bruh he dont even luk like jimin lol

Pewdiepie: if you do this too me, I will shoot you.News channels that hate pewdiepie: pewdiepie says he hates his fans!

<b>Pewd just started the first meme of 2020</b>

<b>PewDiePie: Bro first!!</b><b>T-Series: Corruption!!</b><b>Random British guy: I lOvE bTs!!</b>
Hes trying to be jimin but looks like a woman wth

watching pewdiepie while being drunk, makes me laugh like I laughed at his vids with 14 xD

Walmart vs Gucci
Wanna good joke ?!I forgot my bag

He looked progressively more like a Middle Aged white woman.

He has made music and music videos, there really great!!!

This guy is possessed by Michael Jackson

What the hell man?I do love k-pop and BTS as well, but this is too much...

“I’m not gonna get addicted..”Right because spending $150k to look exactly like this person, literally going around in Korea to find this person, and marrying a cardboard cutout of this person <b>ISNT</b> considered being addicted..<b>right...</b>

Does this count as Koreaboo?

I literally ran to the bathroom to throw up at <a href="">8:55</a> when he started kissing the posters.

Basically my sisters if they were male and rich

I'm the only Russian who came to the Pewdiepie channel
I HAVE BEEN A BRO ARMY AS WELL AS BTS ARMY FOR 5 YRS........HE NEVER DISAPPOINT

I feel bad for anyone that likes kpopI hope they get over that horrible genre of music

Whenever pewdiepie shaves he is cosplaying rm

so i’m an army and all i can say is everyone who likes kpop hates him so much. he’s awful and disgusting. the people who “stan” him are delusional and so is he

Im crying to this video because Pewdiepie is so beautiful  ‍
Aaaahhhhhhh

I don’t like
Dont let him near bts please my god

Me : <b>addicted to smoking</b>Also me: I&#39;m not addicted, I&#39;m aiming for perfection.

I&#39;m obviously in Korea for <b>*slaps face*</b> <b>mY bEaUTifUL trAnSfOrMaTiON</b>

We have imperfections.... Lol get over it. This guy has self confidence issues. Respect that he&#39;s actually pursuing something in life tho.... I&#39;m writing a comment on a yt video

Bts is overrated niggas just attracted to hoe they look ‍️

He&#39;s gonna hate himself in 20-30 years

Stop Asianface

He looks like grandma
Pewds stole something nice from Eldar🇷🇺🇷🇺No
Lol, Felix is wearing a military fleece jacket

Pewds: If any of you f#@ckers do this i will shoot youMe: Sincere Thanks Pewds

Oil: <b>*spends his money to look like Jimin*</b>Jimin’s friend: “Hey you look like iCarly”

stop it this getting creepy

OK, we need to start a Kickstarter and then choose one of us to become Pewds.

This is honestly a terribly depressing story about a person with body dysmorphia.If you have don’t feel right In your own bodyDONT immediately go crazy with surgery to try and fill a void. A transgender friend of mine went through nearly 6 years of therapy to finally understand that she didn’t belong in a mans body. She’s still taking anti depressants even after the 3 years of surgical procedures, she’s happy now because she has a strong support group but it’s been almost ten years of hardship and it took her 6 to decide that this is what she actually wanted. This guy seems like he won’t be happy until he literally replaces the man he wants to be.That’s impossible and psychologically dangerous.Don’t make rash decisions 19 year olds.️

all egdy kpop mfs jus shut. wbk yall aint claim him, we dont need all 7 billion of u here saying it x

Youtuber steals content from another place to make money. It’s the future of entertainment!

<b>breaths in</b><b>sigh</b><b>&quot;SWIMING THROUGH THESE WOMEN GOT ME  FEELIN&#39; ALL LIKE JIMIN! AYE MAKEUP ON MAH FACE GOT ME LOOKING SO APPEALING&quot;</b>

He looks like a cheap version of Kristen Wiig :o

Oli should have looked at pictures of Jimin’s father, because boy is going to grow up.

who is bts? sounds like bacon tomato sandwich

He is more looking like scarlett johansson... = =

This sounds like the start of a murder documentary.

Well...Pewdiepie&#39;s reaction was my reaction when I watched it. But I cringed more.

<a href="">11:10</a> this jimin have 3 fake friend

Jimin is my bias but like hun he doesn&#39;t look like Jimin but on the contrary it never hurt anyone and I agree he looked better before

He looks like my grandma
It&#39;s a waste to try and look like someone else you always end up looking like yourself but even dumber

Sorry pewds the cringe is too strong, I can&#39;t watch!
