First Mani Ratnam, Now Ali Abbas Zafar

Flop series

Goosebumps
OK where the 2nd part ??

The 2004 composition is seems like it had been composed in recently yearPower of rehman&#39;s sir music️

One of the most underrated series 

Magic of Rehman sir.....and brilliant acting performances ...this web series &quot;Tandav&quot;  is so underrated 

On adapting the song, Rahman stated &quot;Abbas Ali called me and said the song was the centre of the whole series. So I said why don’t we tweak the lyrics because they were written for something else. So we got together with the lyricist Mehboob Alam and he wrote an extra antara. Now we have a new intro for the song. We were careful about not changing too much of the original. You get a certain magic in the mix of things. This song has aggression, a sense of melody and harmony.&quot;

Sunil is awesome 

<a href="">1:38</a> 
A R Rahman recreate his composition for this webseries.....because no one has potential to do this for A R rahman music......love u sir....

I am speaking out of context, but this song is incomplete without Surya / Micheal vasanth

<a href="">0:34</a>: epic Line

Ajay ke similar a Puig 

<a href="">0:34</a>: Epic line every Students

Nice

Still relevant yuva now have been fed too much whatsApp gyan..

<a href="">

15 yr old me and 32 yr old me still have the same level of josh after listening to this

This proves yuva was way ahead times...yuvaa movie won&#39;t get  appreciation back when it is needed

The government has been exposed through a web series. The foundation of the government is so weak.
Tamil people be like I am your headmaster on the school you studied

Remembering my school days. The movie yuva was ahead of its time. Ar rahaman worked with mani ratnam multiple times in his career. Dil se, yuva. Yuva was released both in tamil and hindi version with different actors at the same day.

This song was a tribute to George reddy. !!

Like it 
Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan coming in our minds

That&#39;s exactly what magic is... you take a song 15 years old, make no change apart from lyrics, yet it sounds fresh. I bet it still will many years from now

What an amazing series it was.. Loved it

Bhagat Singh ne kaha pado lekin koi collar pakde toh use maar maar ke dho dalo
Yuva(2004)----TandavOm puri----SaifAjay Devgan----ZeeshanAbhishek B---- Sunil GroverNo wonder tandav wasn&#39;t appreciated when you straight copy a movie

Man, this catches faster than covid

This could have been a revolutionary communist show but it went on to become a Bollywood-esque shitshow.

The King composer...️
<a href=""> (art poem)
One of the best webseries I thought Ali Abbas did hard work on it all gave justice to their characters saif ali khan and all . It  gave to feel like rajniti movie both are very different but all roles are very excellent

O....yuva yuva.... o yuva
Behtariin music 
Original remix

It’s a remake song again

Wtf

Welcome back sunil Grover
Rahmans music is always ahead of its time. He has proved this numerous times.

Can anyone provide full version of &quot; dil mein mere tum hi tum ho &quot;.. the song played at very beginning of tandav ep 1 ( gurpal listening while driving)

Op saif

Remake aise karte hai Tseries walo. Seekho kuch 

From original jana gana mana Tamil song to Dhaka laga bukka bollywood song (Film name : yuva (2005) ) to Amazon prime web series &quot;Tandaav&quot; (2020) ....Might be come same song in more remake/remix in next 10 yrs ?? Really amazing journey of this song ️️️

Dil mein mere tum hi tum ho Bhai ah song kah full name batana please Bhai
Oooooh really cool remix fo the old song

Whenever Raavan comes, then Ram will join me.
Its time to unite youth of this country

I watched this series... Delhi based show... Reality of Delhi

Evergreen it&#39;s like a song compose yesterday..... This is the power of original... TX sir.....

Seemed that this Dhakka Laga Bukka is made according to Salman Khan Version ! If you know what I mean ;)

You watch such student politicians rise on screen and it gives you all goosebumps, but when such leader rises in reality you call them with different names, criticize.

The music feels so fresh and crisp. Does not feel like it is almost two decade old track . Kudos to the editor. Also hats off to the idea of reusing this song.  Awesome work 

yes, I am Amit gupta and I am a political analyst and leader but I want to remain a leader but do not want to become a minister because I have to write the future for all...

I am a wounded lion

BJP ki chaddi kholne waali web series hain yeh....I loved it ️️
What is the meaning of dhakka laga bukka

The people praising Rahman sir is the same people who degraded him for the remake if mazzakali .. 

Even after 16 years ARR Music Feels next generation album.. That&#39;s AR power ️

The soul of the song is the Bass guitar and I am glad that they didn&#39;t avoided it in the remake.

I love the series 

Whenever Ravana comes into the womb of Ram, he will become the spirit of India.
I love this movie of tandav 

Mooch and Daari are the pride of those who die...Mooch and Daari are common in this film.
This is how you remake a song without ruining it

new movie <a href="">#hum</a> <a href="">#mard</a>
Till now not even a SINGLE film, web series or serial is made on Muhammad but if someone does and depicts his life inappropriately or disrespectfully would muslims still not protest and demand action...but hindu faith has constantly been stabbed casually just because we were tolerant. Atleast we are following legal means even after repetitive disdain and not beheading someone.

AMAZON ANTI HINDU, HATE HINDU PEASE BOYCOT IT AND HE IS JIHADI COMPANY ISLAMIK COMPANY

BOTH ARE JIHADI ISLAMIK SUVAR

Is this movie remake of old movie Yuva starring  vivek oberoi, ajay devgan, abhishek bachchan, rani mukherjee, kareena kapoor

Zeeshan Ayub's acting is amazing
Tandav is a very very True fact real story of Indian politics ️️️️️️️️️️️ Heart Touching Web Series 
Nobody: Tamilians who heard the original version of this song 2 decades ago be like: WTF

Great sir ️️️️
Kindly note this song too is been composed again by A R Rahman and re-written by Mehboob.. Same team but new lyrics

New lyrics seem forced rather than fitting in well with the rhythm.

It&#39;s disgusting that AR Rahman song is being used by tukde tukde gang who are mocking our (Nepalese) supreme Lord Pashupati Nath in this lousy web series called Tandav. I would like to pee on the team of Tandav. आक थू !

But where is that whistling part?

India will become a Hindu nation Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram.

This country doesn't need people like you. Be prepared to go to jail. UP Police will be coming now.
Insulting Hindus gods this movie 

Boykott hinduphobic bollywood support south.

Every single actor did true justice to their roles. Fantastic movie, an eye opener for today&#39;s YUVA.

Another good music after Scam music

Ayub is a great actor. Khan&#39;s best villainy happened under Bharadwaj&#39;s orchestration. I don&#39;t get it right away here. Glad to see him play bold roles.

Saif ki mkbd

Saif Ali Khan is great actor.

Reminds me it’s been sooo many years of YUVA

REAL HERO IS SAIF ALI KHAN SIR

Make a film on other religions, not on Hindu religion. For their information, there are scriptures like Vedas, Puranas, Bhagwat, Upanishads etc. Make films on Halala, Jihad, religious conversion, traitors, terrorists, rape.
Such a bullshit web series, anti Hindu , anti India, many will be arrested for this rubbish propaganda and agenda shit

I liked politics for 70 years, but now what do you want to convey by making a web series on politics. Drug addict gang. We cannot expect anything good from the Bollywood Naseri gang, such films are creating filth and hatred in the society.
Remake at its best!!! This song is a free remake tutorial to all the unoriginal &quot;composers&quot; out there. Rahman sir wins the youth&#39;s heart, yet again.

I can proudly say the music I like 13 years back is going to follow by Youth Again.Thats Power of Being Rahman .Always 20 years Ahead

A.R.Rehman sir Love you 
The makers couldn&#39;t come up with a new song...they used this track unnecessarily at so many places dat it became boring after a point.. Ali Abbas Zafar pls raise ur bar...

Janagana mana janangalin idaye
And this song suits Ajay Devgan only
This is the title song of the movie Yuva, haaaaa haven't they got a new song?
Yuva anthem 2021

This is what makes me remind of raanjana movie

Ghatiya movies
What a remake man! This is what you really call a youth anthem. Even better than the original one from yuva movie.

Music = A R

Spoiler: Saif Ali Khan didn&#39;t become prime minister!!

Mullo in the series then
The suicide of the girl in last was unexpected for me 

Now can anyone compare this with France making cartoon of their faith and their response.Our way of response to these nonsense is the cause because they Insult us again and again.They are shameless minority, they don&#39;t respect others faith andWe are boneless majority, can&#39;t come together for the respect of our own faith.

The day you go to Sadak, you will be thrown out of the country.
Rahman sir ️
I really like the background score of this series️️

Great

Poor people are venting out their frustration of making a movie. Still Kanhaiya will not come, he will come to Modi. You keep crying. No matter how much you know, worship those goons.
Nostalgic

Bakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkksssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

Time to mod hi
I would rather call it &quot;reuse&quot; with some addition, instead of remake. Because the track was already ahead of its time.

Kanhaiya Kumar: Zeeshan Ayub Shaila Rashid: Kritika KamraDimple Kapadia: Sonia Gandhi Raghu Kishore: Rahul GandhiSAIF ALI KHAN: Hum sab banna chahte hai but bante kabhi nahi ???
When the orginal is remixed with same Great Music Director AR !!!! U get the BEST!!!!

Came here for only Rahman

Fake narrative banned this movie

Fantastic recreation and sounding of the original. Simply the AR magic!

Fabulous series 
Anti Hindu and Anti National Glamour world

Copied and pasted from south indian yuva movie song

This is quite a image clearing series of jamia University and all anti-national youth in there University

Wadtevof time

<a href="">

This Song is in Tamil ( Movie name - Ayutha Eluthu,  Song name - Jana gana)

This series is superb and this song is also awesome, Shiva reminds me of ex JNU president kanhaiya kumar he is gem  and he can contribute alot in development of our nation and to the Indian  politics , kanhaiya kumar deserves a chance.

what india needs

Ajay Devgan walking aggresively reminds me everytime I listen to this song....YUVA Movie️

Watching this I just remembered yuva movie, that&#39;s was great

Tatti web series. Sunil Grover hitman pelted anyone
See how the Modi government wants to trap the farmers by cheating them very cleverly <a href="">
It&#39;s a Biopic of Kanahiya Kumar .. only This Music is Very good but webseries is not Good ..

Disappointing 
That&#39;s the magic is only created again by his Master A.R. Rahman

You are so good ️
Masterpiece ️...I saw the whole series

This song was released in 2003..and the music, arrangement, etc. is still relevant in 2021..thats how futuristic A R Rahman has always been..

Kids listening to this song first time right nowLegends know it since 2004

This is exactly what the movie &quot;Yuva&quot; was about. So glad the song and the movie&#39;s essence are being defined fabulously here.

Original by mani was better

There is such a revolution in India that we need students only through this new India will be born.
What a desperate fucking attempt to create some sympathy for tukde tukde gang

The only good thing about Tandav is this 16 year old masterpiece from the Mozart of Madras.

yuva song???
If you have time to destroy your pass...then watch this series...
producer_ how many actors you want in this webserieDirector_yes

Reminded me of old Yuva !! Rehman Bhai  ko Salaam !

This will be flop.. Amazon making series with left mind set.. Note it

Only thing worth watching is Sunil Grover. Otherwise all people in this movie are Anti CAA, anti hindu.

mulla director Therefore, anti hindu, anti India propaganda guaranteed.
Arr

Amazing Super Fantastic
This song is just awesomeIf you guys don’t mind I recommend the Tamil version of this song which is the original song it’s called Jana Gana Mana from Ayutha Ezhuthu

Now this is a proper remix we need more songs like this

Bhakt movie dekhte time burnol leke baith na.!!!

This is the quality of an Oscar winner...
Thank god kakkrs log nhi banaye
This is Saif who has been declared a senior leader..In real politics he is a youth leader of Saif's age.
JNU's dogs will see this and make fun of their ass on the road.
Ever since Zeeshan started participating in anti national activities, he has become a favorite of Bollywood.
Thank God for not messing with this classic song

@zeeshan ayub got The limelight and role he deserves.

Sunil better than kapil sharma

That&#39;s how you remake a song without destroying original songThank you  AR Rahman sir

Jana gana mana and dhakka laga bukka was originally released in 2004. Now after 17 years in 2021 it is released with a rap

Jana gana mana /Dhakka laga bukka from Yuva (2004. Now after it is used in Tandav (2021) with a rap

Murari of Ranjhana learnt politics from Michael of Yuva /Ayudha Ezhuthu (2004)

Boy : no salary, but ?Girl : you have Nothing, how can I marry you, just leave me, please.Girl leaves.Now Boy talking to himself :I have one villa, 3 plots, 1 ferrari, 2 porsche, 1 Lamborghini, why I still need to buy a cheapBMW, and how can I get salary when actually I am the boss.MORAL :    Don&#39;t judge anyone without knowing the whole thing,  be a listener.If you enjoyed the story plz do “ SUBSCRIBE ” to my channel, I have to reach 2k.And I m sure u will love my contenthave a nice day.



There are 2 probabilities - either Saif will kill Zeeshan or Zeeshan will kill Saif, or some 3rd party will kill both of them.
Yuva, it&#39;s reverse is VAYU ..Which means Air..THIS same trailer is Streaming like AIR...

Sunil Grover is like water, he can be any character , true actor, industry should treat him as an actor rather than comedian, he is an actor who can be anyone as script demands.Happy to see him in serious role.

Here for ARR&#39;s magical music.

Today&#39;s kid wont understand wat music is ..they are happy with tanishk bhagchi songs.

omg saif ali khan is stunning 

This is perfectly adapted and very beautifully executed..Rahman and Mani sir should feel proud of this..they did this 16 years ago and still sounds so good with new lyrics

A.R. Rahman Sir....

Yesterday I was listening to this song, and it here refreshed again.

Another left propaganda 

Another good try by Communists to incite a riot and come out on the roads for anarchy in the name of &quot;bro democracy brooooo&quot;. Even the cast is a famous leftist islamist and the other cast is a guy who has named his son after one of the most brutal man to have been a genocidal against Hindus, but people don&#39;t see these easily identifiable propaganda for some reason.

Thanks for not f*cking up the old classic..

Yuva movie song.....
This song is taken from &quot;ayutha ezluthuthu&quot; ( three dots) . Ar music

Another propaganda in the name of Shree Ram to break India!

Krtitka kamra

Zeeshan and saif ali khan️

A.R.Rahman 
The song is still so catchy and perfectly captures mood

I am glad that Amazon decided to use this song in 2021, Its timeless! Compare this with today&#39;s music and you would understand what garbage is being fed to us now. We downgraded from AR Rahman, Shankar, Ehsaan &amp; Loy, Vishal &amp; Shekhar to the likes of Badshah, Tony Kakkar and Tanishk Baghchi!

What a coincidence!!!!! yashraj mukhate has composed a similar one before

why rahman sir is a living legend!!!!

Solid

Fake views

Damn nostalgic. Yuva was such an epic movie.

A song made by Rehman in early 2000s is being reused 20yrs later...represents the timelessness of his fabulous music

Best line -Whenever Ravana comes, there will be room in every womb ️️
Yuva came on 2004 and it&#39;s been 16 years of this masterpiece album.ARR is so ahead of his time that this song is still getting addictive to listen in repeat mode and refreshing..goat..️️

Phew 
Ooo YUVA .... YUVAAH.......A R R A H M A N
Suni grover....man....how beautifully has he transformed everything about him for this character. Body language and those eyes !!.....if we remember dhippadh from patakha. Hands down man......killin it he is...

I hope this full song is there in the series

Good but Aarambh hai prachand still remains best.

That's kannadiga nakul abhayankar 
Stop using old tracks and create something different.

I love these song from yuva

This is what we call a genuine remake

Youth anthem
JNU students watching this - hamare aise sapne......barbaad kar diye shah

Zeeshan great actor
Seems like OTTs are not only doing justice with the stories but with the music too. This is how you should remake a song without killing the original one.  YUVA vibes all over!

Am i only one who is very excited to watch Sunil grover  in this fire look...?? 

Only for A R Rahman!!

<a href="">0:35</a> Sounds like Akshay Kumar
Thank you so much all for your overwhelming response to YouTube channel MURABBI MURABBI... A R Rahman musical YouTube channel!

No one Replace Ajay Sir

Song from Mani Ratnam's movie Yuva film Ha Ji Ye  copypaste 
Amazing 
A.R Rehman 
Sunil grover has too much fab

Show this to Tanishk Baagchi. He should learn how to remake a song from this video 

Yuva’s theme song copied.

Youth of the country is destroyed in hatred , fake news , unemployment .... Youth has power to change the system..

LOOKS LIKE KANHAIYA KUMAR, SHELA RASHID, UMAR KHALID
Devotees
Yes, i am not here for song, i am here for movie

Love you saif ️️️
AR Rahman&#39;s every creation is timeless!

In just 10sec got goosebumps awasome man

support farmers 
looks like, the Tandav is very similar to Ajay Devgan&#39;s Yuva movie. Even the music is matching with it.

Beggar work and dull acting and boring work!
HansRaj College

It&#39;s a remake song from ajay devgan film yuva they just copied and pasted it when director like Ali abbas zafar are working on web series who remakes bharat and gunday and this series is also based on house of cards ‍ I don&#39;t know why they are trying to Destroy Indian web series where they already destroyed Bollywood

Very cool version and video! Especially Zeeshan

Fantastic
rajkumar would be better option than zeeshan

hope it didnt try to justify ndefend the idiotic n antinational deeds of JNU students like kanhaiya gang

Goosebumps this was my fav from movie &#39;Yuva&#39;

awesome thats how u remake a song!!!

Bloody propaganda
This is the power of Rahman&#39;s Music... Always ahead of time.. ️️

Here for A R RAHMAN SIRThis song is one of the example why Rahman sir Always called &#39;Ahead of his time&#39;

Now That&#39;s A lot of Talent

Thanks for reviving this song without spoiling it !

wow wow wow....what a Song️️️Thank You A R  Rahman Sir
Why are web series being remake even now?
Kudos to the creator...for this recreation

Is the series based on JNU and Jamiya Islamiya???

A. R. Rahman majical
So this is basically CAA-NRC protest on reels.

Surya movie song thane ithu

If this doesn&#39;t make you watch the show, then I don&#39;t know what would!

AR RAHMAN 
Justifying the original trackThanks for not ruining it..

Aayutha ezhathu

Ar Rahman OP

This song has come a long way!

Music magician AR Rahman sir  Yuva
Hindu virodhi
This happens only in reel life,real life  is Kanhaiya kumar lost bihar elections

Rahman Saab... you lifted my spirits again! This is one of my all-time favorite tracks and Thank God you re-mastered it yourself, not any Bag&quot;chhii&quot; or &quot;Bad&quot;shah.

Music effects although it&#39;s taken from ajay devgan starrer Yuva

IMO Zeeshan Ayub is terrible casting in front of Saif Ali Khan to counter.

Needless to say, the original video of this song from Yuva is gonna get a lot of attention.

technique hi galar h tumhari apni party wali

Sunil Grover is a miscast. He looks like a joker

superb

<a href="">1:23</a>

I want a role

1: 23 the sound effect is soooooo hilarious

wow

Amazon Prime is really doing great job...Maximum best series of India are from Amazon be it Family Man, Bandish Bandits, Panchayat, Breathe, Mirzapur , Afsos, Patal Lok and now Tandav... Too good

Dumb Brain video

Bollywood series are really on  but movies are  fasak

This is how you remake a song without destroying the original essences

Are those actors playing Rahul Gandhi , kanaiya kumar? And those beating scene was from Jamia or Jnu? Controversy coming soon

Song and music 

<a href="">0:27</a> jab jab raavan ayega- shows saif aliis that a nod to Adi Purush?

<a href="">2:44</a> Beautiful love u
Yaaaaaa it&#39;s yuva movie song... great song
Who thinks that saif ali khan is amit shah and that boy is kanhaiya Kumar JNU

Jabardast
Is this YUVA 2 ..?

Now the remix song is going on OTT also.
2004 comes back

Looking strong

Eagerly waiting please don&#39;t disappoint

Who else find similarities in Zeeshan Ayub character and Kanhaiya Kumar ?

Saif on fire...he is really talented..

This is going to be real big

Mr AR.Rehman Plz Do not Enter in This Remix Shit

Season 2 is coming soon️
Sunil grover fan like here

Sunil Grover looks like a badass in this series.

Seems inspired by Mani Ratnam&#39;s Yuva. They&#39;ve used the songs too

Sunil Grover
Modi vs kanhiya kumarI know the story️️️
Isn&#39;t this the song from yuva?

Start hoga to post karna full show
Dis is an iconic song! Fr d first tym after a long while an old song used in a movie/series makes sense n fuuuuck itz too good!

<a href="">

This is what we call a remix of old song...true gem of india ar rehman sir

15 ko Tandav, 19 ko Family Man trailer, phir 12 feb ko Family Man, mein to busy :)

Rehman magic still better then today s recreation songs

Renamed it as JNU

All time I listen this song goosebumps in my body

chutiyapa sunil gober
Amazing 
Saif Ali Khan Is looking dashing
Lol Nice try to peddle Communist agenda... JNU type street and student politics ...raising slogans and inciting violence. Also note the Bhagat Singh Quote. Communism has a place in a democracy but there is no democracy in Communism. P. S I absolutely love the song. It&#39;s pumping and AR Rahman is a magician.

Murari of Ranjhana ️️  learnt his politics from Kundan

A R Rehman 

Yf

Glad they didn&#39;t remixed and ruined this

We are waiting for this series 

Zeeshan is new ayushmaan khurana Hitmachine
Legends know .. its an old song from movie Yuva

All hail to Rahman sir !!!!!!

Now this adds to the playlist of protesters.....new song to be played at some protest hadd hai

Always AYUDHA EZHUTHU  is mass.... Waste REMIX....Suriya presence impossible

A R Rahman

Youth should know about politics only then we can be the power of the country...Jay Hind
Very nice  ️️
Zeeshan is the best bollywood actor

Ab hoga tandav
This song is cringe, rest is good.

Technique is right with you
