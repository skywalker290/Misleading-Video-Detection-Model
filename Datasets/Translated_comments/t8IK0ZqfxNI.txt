Courtois 🔥🔥
Thibaut Courtois 🫶💖💖
who else is back in 2024 watching this ?!?!

Hazard destroyed the brazil that day

I feel bad for neymar

Belgium worst team in the world

Renato Augusto was the savior for Brazil, the problem is that he faced Courtois who was in the devil mode actived

Who else here after Hazard interview?

Belgium 🇧🇪
Brazil 🇧🇷
Lost own 🎉
Just like Messi's Bags of Gold are all stolen. That game was too.
It's so sad for Belgium... They have never reached a final and their big brother Netherlands has already reached it 3 times. Hahahahahahahahaha
De bruyne goal was faster than light

In last 5 world cups brazil lost against european teams on knockout stage...

Unforgettable match,where were you when Kevin scored that goal?

That de bruyne shot was faster than speed of sound

Fernandinho fdp, My deputy at Libertadores.
marcelo played his heart out in this one,,, casemiro greatly missed

Brazil 1x2 Belgium
Still here in 2023, best WC.

I still enjoy it
why would you leave a player like De bryne run so free , De bryne IQ is on another level he knew it that they think he will pass

Like if you are experiencing the catastrophic situation in Brazil in 2023.
Belgium CHUDI

The worst generation in Brazilian footballCongratulations to the Belgians!

Lukaku run faster than my wifi.

Lakaka was better then.

De Bruyne bullet Shot ☄🔥
2026 Brazil won the world Cup

That was sad
Sry that we cooked u up brazil.

Ya know when are we gonna realize that Brazil players don&#39;t have it as a collective anymore

Tetouan

That 2nd goal was like a sick wrist shot in hockey. Goalie had no chance

4 years later both going home from Croatia 💪💪💪💪🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Brazil played Belgium scored
the satisfy hold a reels

Kdb insane goal 👀
The Brazilian deserved this shame, for idolizing the influencer Neymídia!!!
We should not be watching these highlights because of what Russia&#39;s now getting up to in Ukraine.

All because of Belgium goalkeeper. Otherwise they would have conceded more goals

Quite sad to see this performance from Belgium compared to their performance this last 2022 WC.

De bruyne🔥
<a href="">1:03</a> the commentary in 2014 said exactly the same when Klose scored against Brazil.

!BRAZIL BELGIUM ! GOL JAPAN GO GO NEYMAR JR NO BALIAO
Hazard played the game of his life here. I miss this Hazard

Me coming here after Kevin Debryune Shot in champions league Semifinal Madrid vs City. Indeed very similar 🙌

2014 Quarter FinalArgentina 🇦🇷 1 - 0 🇧🇪 Belgium2018 Quarter FinalBelgium 🇧🇪 2 - 1 🇧🇷 Brazil.Belgium surely learn thier mistake from the 2014 World cup against Argentina 🇦🇷and that&#39;s 2018 they beaten Brazil 🇧🇷

Back when Eden Hazard was world class 😭😢

FIFA DID NOT SHOW THE PENALTY ON GABRIEL JESUS ​​SHAMEFUL
Game stolen!
Brazil when they lost: how I lost to Belgium, surely because of that own goal
Lukaku&gt;&gt;&gt;Neymar
Belgium🇧🇪: Peace 😎✌️<b>Renato Augusto enters the field</b>Belgium🇧🇪: FUCKED 😰😰🥶🥶
The fire match ever

i love belgium spain argentina germany italy france japan united states odio brazil futebol club

That De bruyne goal was a rocket.

Brazil, as always in every World Cup, fails to make it through the quarterfinals, eliminated by the Europeans. Germany 2006: Brazil 🇧🇷 0 - 1 France 🇫🇷 South Africa 2010: Brazil 🇧🇷 1 - 2 Netherlands 🇳🇱 Russia 2018: Brazil 🇧🇷 1 - 2 Belgium 🇧🇪Qatar 2022: Brazil 🇧🇷 1(2) - 1(4) Croatia 🇭🇷
Friendly 1818 : Brazil 1 - 2 Germany Imagem Black and White.

1810 - 1818

Guilherme - Dionatan - Tisil - Pepe - Mario - Gustavo - Renato - Borges - Coutinho - Neymar - Costa
Backup Douglas (center back), Croix (Sumi), Rodrygo (wing), Guilherme (goalkeeper), Bressan (air)
As a Portuguese fan this match is the only thing giving me hope

Being the favourites

I remember watching this match when I was 10 confident that my team (Brazil) would win. After the match ended and Brazil was defeated I cried for literal hours and even cried the next few days, even 5 years later this match still makes me sad.But Congrats Belgium from brazil, you defeated us

got the Samba dancer

Best match ever

USA VS PERU 1-3

Bro why always BRAZILLLL

Brazils is so bad luck...dont worry...insallah next world cup..in hexa mission,,,🥺🥺😥😥

Kdb easily best midfielder

lol when de bruyne scored i went to check if my playback speed was on 1,5 or something...the ball just teleported into the net with a speed of light

Thanks for all these moments guy

Well played by both teams!

This was Belgium last hope to have won the world cup

I get a smoothie everytime when BRAziL looses!!!Waahahahaha- AR Fan!!!

Courtois mvp
“4 Years Later” Morocco: For you BrazilBrazil: Thanks Morocco
The masterpiece of the golden generation
Brazil stuck in Quaterfinals again 😂😂

Lddllm
Love from India❤️🇮🇳❤️
brazil  best
wow wow wow Lukaku Now

<a href="">0:52</a>

Brazil is a over hyped team 😤

Brazil will win the World Cup the day it has a good defense, all the World Cups are a shame, they don't know how to defend.
Alisson very bad, because...
I&#39;m here again after 4 years just to see the fabulous de bruyne goal.

Brazil  currently  worst  team 😡😡

In 2022 nayamar still crying like a pupit

--87

Brazil have disappointed for 2 decades now..

I don't know how Brazil lost
2022 out of group stage 😂😂

2022 Brazil lose to a team with red and white again

Just came here after Croatia knocked them out on pens

Who is here after Brazil lost to corotia

Who is After loss against Croatia 💔

BRAZIL 2022. BYE BYE BYEEEE AGAINNN

Who come here after 2022 quarter final

Now Croatia gave them a ticket back home

here we meet again

Again eliminated in the Quaters

don't cry Brazil
That very moment when Belgium was the favorite and not Brazil
brazil just didn&#39;t score a goal too bro look at the size of the belgium goalkeeper

🇭🇷 Croatia will make new history🤭see u 🐈
Wonderful 👍😊.... Brasil lost is wonderful
Brazil is very confident evry world cup. I wanna see how far they can go this yr

What a shame. 2018 was the real deal for us. Guess we gonna see the Red Devils shine again in 8 years 🙌🏼

If brazil won this, I&#39;m pretty sure that France would have been trashed by this Brazil

and thats why courtois is my favorite goalkeeper!!

Hope this will not happen again.
It&#39;s funny how this was Brazil&#39;s first decent team in that cup and they lost, after beating their joke group and thinking they will win everything.fast forward to 2022, again same story, Croatia will be their first decent opponent and they already think they will win, while this Croatia is on the same level as this Belgium or probably even better...

Prime Belgium 🇧🇪. Now when you look back that was there chance to win the cup

Sadly we lost for them and that year, but in this year, the world cup will be ours!!!

This was their best chance, BelgiumDe bruyne was right when he said that.

It’s crazy that this Belgium golden generation achieved nothing while every player were in their primes smh

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Are you satisfied with the players leaving this year's Chelsea World Cup?
Korean team will beat the Brazil like this at 16 of Qatar world cup 2022!

Who miss Belgium in 2018? They used to play really well. Although I love Brazil the most, I have been Belgium fan since that time.

2022 Belgium Go Home 🤣🤣
Belgium shoulda gotten to the final 2018

Who come here after belgium knocked out from group stage in wc 2022

<b>Belgium knocked out form the group stage,Fifa 2022</b><b><i>First of all, Belgium&#39;s 2022 team lacks unity &amp; trust.</i></b>Players inter-personal conflict caused them losing many games .It will be hard for Belgium build a team like this.

From 3rd place to first round Eliminate😢

One of the most intense matches I&#39;ve seen in my life

Was very hard to watch this live in 2018. Though even as a Brazilian, I have to admit Belgium played very well. We got the upper hand in the second half, but by then it was too late. Hope we can win this year, but we&#39;ll see.

Belgium goalkeeper is beast

With the a bit of help from the referee. Belgium made this win. Just same now with Morocco, pay to win team

De bruyne goal was cleaner than my soap 💀

Brazil thought they was gonna make noise after beating a Garbage Mexican team only to lose to a much more Superior team

2022

If you're not Belgian then you're Brazilian
Lakaka

The best game of the 2018 World Cup without a doubt
Every world cup people fancy Brazil... And they have failed ever since...

The team that can beat Brazil will definitely win, or at least go to the final.
So how come you can beat Brazil but not win? Lackluster against France. Just make it annoying.
Brazil need this🤣🤣🤣
Who is here watching old matches before the start of the world cup 2022🥳

David Beckham soccer advertisement before this

Brazil will win this World Cup

I love this game😂😃

And now Canada want to compite whith as Belgium and CroatiaChears from Croatia

Brazil will win this team. ❤ From 🇵🇰

Kevin is a hero

Who&#39;s the commentator?

It even hurts to watch as brazil fan still now .Duck that woodwork

De bruyne power shot
<a href="">0:19</a> bounced his back

I find it funny that Brazil is every year the favourite but didn’t win any World Cup since 2002

Brazil will come back 💛💛
I came from the future to say that Brazil is the sixth World Cup champion 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Brazil ☕️😂😂
One day india will play World Cup 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Belgium is the best
Courtoises one of the best Goal 🥅 saved match 🙂!

<a href="">0:53</a> lukaku laying down😂
<a href="">0:32</a> turns on subtitles

Brazil is always favorite at every world cup

I still remember this game even it been 4 years. My full family were cheering for Brazil, and i was the only one who wat cheering for Belgium. And literally everyone made fun of me.

KDB best player 👍
Courtois was on FIREEEEEEEE

Belgium did not deserve to win because Brazil played better
Brazil lost 98 2006 2010 2014 2018...the future looks promising lol,,,,,,,Neymar been with Brazil for the past 11 yrs so far and still 0 WC,,,,where is the legend Neymar??🙃🙃🙃🙃 lol

Belgium won the match, because of courtoya....

Favorite has gone! 😅

Who was the commentator in this match?? I&#39;ve been searching month after month, but in vain.

brazil would have won if it was neymar

How a keeper can win a match.

Who would win if brazil faced france?

I will get my revenge in Qatar&#39;s final tournament🇯🇵

Brasil take revenge in 2022 world cup

It was a fairytale for Belgium 🇧🇪 over 4 years ago

He lost Casemiro and got Ricardinho, that was a joke.
Belgium ran over Brazil. They deserved the victory.
Losser day from brasil

European pride. Congratulations Belgium always ahead of America
commentator name please?

This is Yes recibe Jesus Christ salvation personal this Yes recibe in My ♥️ 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
if the former Brazilian team reaches the quarterfinals, it will probably face either Germany or Belgium. At least two goals they take, how do they want to compete in the world cup with two elders in defense (T. silva and Marquinhos)? DT Tite is happy and confident to have beaten Bolivia and Peru in their qualifiers and thinks they are favourites. Tell him that only Neymar is in the squad and no one else. Ronaldo has already retired and Brazil is a former national team.

Brazil played well but unfortunately lost for him

De Bruyne my best Midfielder in the world

I came to review it after Luke Skywalker's uncle mentioned it in the movie THIRTEEN LIVES - THE RESCUE
Love fr kerala

Marcelo fails! 😞
Belgium will not go beyond the 8th finals, it will run into Spain or Germany

One of the my favourite match ❤️🔥

2002Jul 6

high level commentary

Brazil&#39;s luck was bad that day..

Rene Augusto of Beijing

Dont fool yourselves 2022 is the best Brazilian team i saw... Brazil is going to lift the six!

We were supposed to win!, but it was better to lose with honor to Belgium than to face France and be humiliated.
i was born in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and my father was graduated from leuven Belgium

How much things have changed.

De bruyne two nil
I will always rembember this game 😔

Congratulations to Belgium's greatest achievement, they beat Brazil 2-1 👏👏🙌🙌🇧🇪🇧🇪
🇻🇪: you're doing it right🇧🇷: I'm doing EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🇲🇽: Let's not eliminate Belgium for long
Foul on Jesus was clearly penalty.

This is one of my clearest memories

What is going on here

Brazil 🇧🇷 six-time champion 2022
Brazil Vs Courtois...
2nd goal belgium like bullet

Brazil is better anyway
Diche boira stay that
Haha the commentator after kdb&#39;s goal.Well belgium had prime hazard prime lukkaku prime kdb...I expected fireworks from both sides.

At this time, the country had collapsed. Belgium was currently unable to open.

My heart dropped that time I was only 6

<a href="">1:45</a> Min what a shot Neymar

I remember watching this game with belgian fans, at that moment <a href="">0:53</a>, I stood up and screamed &quot;shoot&quot;, and for a second there everything felt in sync.Absolute scenes, I never forget that, what a goal!

Courtois only. Belgium was crushed!

The last save decided every thingOtherwise Brazil vs croatia final

Marcelo is a comedy, right Man! You see Bruyne approaching... Shorten the broder guy's space. No. Let the guy kick and try to deflect the ass kick. Speaks seriously.
Barzil 😥😥😥😥
As someone from Belgium, this was really the best day of my life. I can still feel the excitement. That magical evening and the upcoming days were amazing. Next morning, I was at the airport. You could feel the atmosphere, everyone knew what had happened the day before. Everyone was so happy. Amazing what a simple game can do.

<a href="">1:04</a> &quot;Brazil in deep trouble now&#39;&#39;I have heard this phrase somewhere else before

2008 lol mulki

I came back just to see this robbery😡
37.614

Best game in history
This game broke my heart😭😭

Tenks live

Are we going pass the fact Brazil didnt beat an european team in knockout since 2002?

Belgium
WHY DOES NOBODY TALK ABOUT THE PENALTY OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR BRAZIL????!
The greatest victory in the history of the Belgian club! The greatest save from Courtois and the greatest goal in his career for the national team from DeBruyne))))))) It turns out that it matters who is in goal and who the key midfielders play for)))))
Heart broken match 😭😭😭💔
Renê Augusto almost saved the game
I&#39;m Brazilian and I say: Belgium deserved to win.Both teams played very well. Brazil was extremely better than the disastrous 7x1 of 2014. But Belgium took better advantage of opportunities and finishes, an example was Kevin&#39;s beautiful goal. It was a fair win and a very hot gamecome 2022!!!

“Courtois is huge.” - Neymar then takes a shot at the goal and Courtois catches it.
Okay, but what about the penalty against Gabriel Jesus????
Belgium
Xg for this game be Brazil 3.0 - 0.7 Belgium. Very clinical from Belgium

This is the game that hurt all of South America
De Bruyne goal was faster than my wifi🤍

That Coutinho&#39;s assist🔥🔥 Debruyne and Coutinho 🔥Two of the best Midfielders at that time😍 and Neymar × hazard Two of the best left wingers at that time 💥💥

Japan gave Belgium a more difficult time than Brazil 😂

Poor Neymar

Go Belgium
Brazil, a giant with feet of clay!
“Here is lukaku know Like A Tank”😂😂😂

They didn&#39;t even show in the video, but Brazil had a great chance to equalize the score with Renato Augusto, but he missed his shot.

Belgium and France were the best in the 2018 World Cup!!
anyone who paid attention to the game, He saw that the game was bought, several favorable fouls for Brazil that could be marked...

4 years later and I think Brazil are in a much better spot than they were before the 2018 World Cup, I think the squad we have is much better and we have a lot of depth, along with a new generation rising

You saw thiago Silva&#39;s facw after his knee touch hit the crossbar, that&#39;s that&#39;s trueee hunger for your nation.

Sad game, just humiliation after humiliation. Brazil has become the shame of world football.
The truth is that the Belgium goalkeeper saved Belgium, Brazil was massacring but the ball did not go in.

I think that neymar last shot hitting the bar. after I know through commentary and replay it was a magical save from curtois

I drove it haha
That De Bruyne strike was faster than Usain Bolt

Sad for arabs that said English commentators are boring 😂

<a href="">0:00</a> hours of hours, in Sproul?
Really tough game, in fact Brazil played way batter than Belgium but it just happens, soccer is just beautiful… ❤️🙌🇧🇷  🇧🇪

Kudnaha hahahahahahahaha

Great game, I hope it is repeated in the Qatar 2022 groups.
Best day of my life (football speaking)
Belgium will NEVER  win a World Cup! Fact!Brazil will always be the BEST!  PERIOD!

Brazil had 3 ungiven penalties.
Neymar : « imma score a goal »Courtois : « Denied. »
This world cup is fantastic

Hazard was great

You can not blame brazil not playing well. Fernandino gave a gift otherwise the match would had turned in the favor of Brazil. Half of the teams are from Europe in the world cup which is not fair I guess

<a href="">0:50</a> &quot;lukaku is like a tank&quot; LOL
De Bruyne&#39;s goal was absolutely brilliant 👏

Ohh  Brazil
I thought there would be more whites in Belgium

etc
The minute in De Bruyne&#39;s goal is wrong, was in the 31st minute not at 26th

Ah, what magic from Brussels sprouts

Belgium should win

Now, fernadinho and de bruyne are one team

<a href="">1:10</a> LOL

With today's Brazilian team, I doubt Belgium would win. I think we would be the ones to score 2-1 on them.
Well played The football kings our Viva Brazil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Well played The only 1Maaa Ney😘😘😘
C&#39;mon, the best match in the whole world cup. Brazil played much better, really deserved to win, but not always the best team wins.

Nice match, good luck to Brazil and congratulations to Belgium
This match is a golden one

:(

People saying belgium won easilyCome on if you had watched the match both sides played well. and Brazil attacked way better after 2-0. It was just that fernandinho had bad luck and courtois was on fire that day. Else who knows there could hv been more drama like penalty shootout

0.25 speed is also fast and 2 speed is amazing

Oh neymar last shot 😑
I want to eat Belgian waffles.
Basics for goalkeepers, &quot; ball in the small area belongs to the goalkeeper! &quot;
Brazil literally lost in terms of physical preparation... lacked speed
Chelsea vs. Chelsea

This is Belgium's biggest title.
That day was sad 🥲
Brazil lose this game because of Belgium goalkeeper impossible saves😢

There will be a return, there will be a return😏
Be thankful that it didn't make you suffer as much as Germany did in 2014.
b

Here we are now in 2022,i hope Brazil will  lift the world cup trophy for sure,a fan from  beautiful country Nepal🇳🇵❤️❤️

That de bruyne goal was astonishing

Brazil is losing for Khankir Pula goalkeeper💔😩😩
Only Italy the belgium nightmare !

This announcer was boring

what a humiliation to lose to belgium
The year of revenge has arrived, this 2022 World Cup is ours, Go Brazil 🇧🇷
Highest! !
how sad this game vsf belgium
I&#39;m a fan of neymar so I&#39;m kind of sad for Brazils lose but congrats Belgium love from jordan, 🇧🇪🇯🇴

<a href="">0:52</a> legends say Lukaku is still lying down

<a href="">0:57</a> bekfast
at <a href="">0:53</a> my heart is at 3000!
When Belgium scored the second goal I was just asking not to be like Germany in 2014
Oo

Lukaku the best

Courouis closes the Semi final door for Brazil 🙂💯 especially the last Short from Neymar 💯

Unlucky Brazil💔
Belgium were so strong but in this match Brazil has the most unlucky on this cup, we really deserved win this game

Thibaut Curtois&#39; save off Neymar&#39;s shot at the 90+ minute was the decisive moment for Belgium against Brazil.

De Bruyne's shot was a missile
This match is really tragic.

♥️ GLORY TO GOD ♥️🙏..
Why do commentators have try pronounce the names in an accent? Why “Voncont” instead of “Vincent” just something that bugs me 😂

that goalie, what an uncanny resemblance to De Gaulle

Sorry for asking Why Belgians are Bald Head Mostly?

This Brazil was very strong, they were eliminated by an own goal and they gave up clear scoring chances, I wouldn't be surprised if they won the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, today they are stronger than in 2018.
Best match of the 2018 World Cup

Brazil had a respectable campaign, greetings from Peru.
I love when he says ......De Bruyne 2-0 Belgium what&#39;s going on here

Brazil played well, attacked a lot, the real problem was Fernandinho, if it hadn't been for the own goal we would have gone to penalties, then the story could have been different
Welcome to Qatar🇶🇦

KDB  or wott

Gabriel Jesus telling to his team mates :- Dont let debryune shoot🔥💥💥💥
Them saves from Belgium&#39;s keeper were legendary! <a href="">1:17</a> and <a href="">1:44</a>

That day the Belgian goalkeeper screwed up, he just watched Brazil arrive and the game arrived, the truth is that it had nothing to do with Concacaf.
I still come here to suffer haha
still gives goosebumps!

Why do you have VAR? If not, is there a penalty?
On a I du ass.
belgium really deserves to win a world cup respect from brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇪

That wasnt an upset.

He says what is going on here but weren’t Belgium ranked higher than Brazil at the time

Belgium wins this matchFIFA: Perfect, you will be in first place in the FIFA ranking for 3 years
The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can ❤️

Why Courtois have a pro gipper Belgium is too lucky

Every European team: we don’t care who wins as long as it’s not BrazilBelgium: We got your back

Ogu!
Brazil crushed Belgium! He deserved to win. But football has these... Do what
From Algeria 🇩🇿I don&#39;t support Brazil 🇧🇷 but there are at least 02 penalties

where is VietNam

I remember when belgium lose of italy on euro 2020.

Whenever it comes to play against European teams.... Brazil Argentina get knocked out

<a href="">0:50</a>

Which commutator is this

Vsfd corteis closed goal Brazil could take 1000 more shots and the goal wouldn't come out
jajaja

Gabriel said &quot;don&#39;t let him (Kev) shoot&quot; and they just let him shoot easily

No one to miss Lukaku 🤦🏿‍♂️
Debrune
<a href="">0:53</a> why nobody is talking about the power on the shot struck by de bruyne.No goalkeeper in the world would have saved that.

Towards hexa in Qatar
Man of the match, Courtois.

Brazil&#39;s football is dead.

It was one of the best matches I have ever seen and I will remember this match for the rest of my life.
<a href="">1:43</a> The whole of Brazil was practically on its knees with this defense
Im from Brasil, and I support Belgium too (just when they dont play against brasil), and in my point of view, Belgium still with the same gameBetter team in 0-45, and in 45-90 they open his defense and then stop attacking, which made Brasil be better. It happened again today, in semifinals of Nation League, france score 3 goals without difficult (🇧🇪 2-3 🇫🇷)Belgium just win in 2018 because courtois was in the best

So sad for brazil they played better than belgium

I&#39;m Brazilian and that day... I was sad 😔🖤🇧🇷

Belgium &lt; Brazil. Brazil is better than Belgium.Brazil unlucky.If Brazil meet again Belgium I believe Brazil will win 5-0. I love Brazil.I love Brazil even if they lose.from Vietnam 🇻🇳

<a href="">0:00</a> Hello and Welcome to Kazan, for What is going to be some game in the World Cup here.<a href="">0:09</a> Brazil<a href="">0:10</a> against...<a href="">0:11</a> Bosnia.

Im from Brazil, Courtois did miracles in this game... Too bad he was never the same again

Lukaku: Falls De Bruyne: Scores Lukaku: 🧎🏾‍♂️
In Brazil the employees only work from seven to one

What an archazo Courtouis
<a href="">0:53</a> what a blow from De Bronha.
What a great team Belgium, one day the Peruvian team will reach the level.
And here's Tite again to deliver another World Cup.. okay Loko.. it's fucked up.. he's going to die hugging Neymar one more time
Little brother, what happened what happened? 😜
Germany 7 -  Brazil 1
Brazil&#39;s revenge is coming soon 🔥

Without a doubt there was a robbery, there was a penalty in favor of Brazil and they didn't score
Belgium by sheer luck won the match, they are thinking.

Brazilians who supported Korea 😂😂😂

De bruyne goal was one of the best goals in 2018 fifa world cup

I remember watching this in Spain with a bar full of belgians

If Brazil does not win that World Cup, they will never win one again.
Fifa world cup next year  who is happy

I can&#39;t believe that this happened 3 years ago!

Hard to believe this was 3 years ago

And to think that at the end of 2019 everything would change with covid
Great. belgium..jose from paraguay
Brazil Don't Cry Hahaha. How long the Taste lasted for those from Brazil Hahaha
Japan almost beat Belgium, who knocked out Brazil, with two first goals lol.
This was the worst day in 2018

Lukaku with hair.

Imagine the final Between Brazil vs France Hard luck Brazil

3 years passed. 🙄. So many memories ❤️ russia world cup. Midnight party with friends watching matches. 😭. Qatar World cup can&#39;t match this. ❤️

This day cortua finished Brazil.. Bad luck for brazil.Brazil did everything to win the match but courtua was insane 🔥

To all Belgium Fans; u have been thrashed in Euro 2020...

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

:(

Last 2 World Cup, Brazil played against 4 European Teams...Won just once...Against Croatia 3-1 in 2014 Serbia is an Eurasian Country ...They lost against Germany 7-1They drawn against Switzerland 1-1They lost against Belgium 2-1

BELGIUM 👍👌
Too bad Belgium defense is made of Tottenham players...

WoW Brazil is now just straigh up losing to anyone..

3 TAHUN YANG LALU

BeNe countries always gonna beat Brazil.

The keeper was in the mood

Luck didn&#39;t support us. We missed a lot of chance of scoring goals. Our team was better than today&#39;s team.

This game happened on my birthday of 8 years, i hope that i not pass bad lucky

The sad thing is that these highlights  do not show the impact Hazard had on this game

Great strike from Kevin de bruyne a future icon for Belgium and so far Man City

i got massive nostalgia when he said, &quot;courtois the chelsea goalkeeper&quot;

<a href="">0:52</a>Lukaku: *your gamemode is now spectator *YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IF YOU PLAYED MINECRAFT)

And where is the title as first in the world ... No EM, no World Cup ... Hmm ... Greetings from the four-time world champion and three-time European champion Germany

<a href="">0:47</a> lukaku like a tank 😂👍
Remember Brazil was beaten by Germany 7 to 1,came back in the Olympic soccer tournament to win the gold medal.

This was a revenge for the WC 2002 when the goal from Wilmots was not allowed!

Coutihno&#39;s pressure was too late to stop Deburine.

Who&#39;s here after Belgium 🇧🇪 losing in the quarter 🤔final in Euro 2021?

BRAZIL IS A KAKA IN THE WORLD CUP SELECTION CRAP, FROM THE RAPE OF GERMANY PARÁ TO THE BRAZIL WEBAS
How nice it is to see Brazil humiliated haha
My fav team Belgium...👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I dont like brazil
gaaaaa

Belgium : The Golden Gen

How were Brazil the favorites?? 😭

Soon belgium era will end

BELGIUM 0 ITALY 2

Belgium winning Euro 2020
That last from coutrois was unbelievable and sensational 💥💥💥💥💥💥Coutrois is underrated
commentator: &quot;what is going on here?&quot; you know exactly what is going on. brazil is way too overrated pieces of craps just like argentina, some 16 year olds from Germany or Belgium can beat all Brazil in football. pathetic. overrated.

oh almost 3 years ago and I still remember that day vividly in my head

The commentator: &quot;Lukaku is like a tank&quot;. Lol

Belgium should have won this World Cup

Brazilian Manager please change your goalie!

If that Neymar&#39;s Last shot connected into the goal, Brazil Would&#39;ve been the Champions 🏆🏆🏆

Ball possessionBrazil:- 59%Belgium:-41%ShotsBrazil:-27(9 on target) Belgium:-9(3 on target) Still Brazil lost 2-1 to Belgium

Brazilians just can&#39;t handle countries with black red and yellow stripes in their national flag

I think the 18,000 people who disliked are Brazilians

let&#39;s say that Brazil dominated Belgium, keeping more with the ball and just look at that goal by Belgium, it wasn&#39;t even their goal, it was an own goal. if it wasn&#39;t for that I say I would have won the world cup

The envious scent untypically hum because work consequentially man against a delicious magic. neighborly, shaky base

Commentator does not know what he is talking about. Belgium was favorite for many and not Brazil.  Don&#39;t forget Brazil still shaking off 7 - 1 loss to Germany.

Wait a second, Belgium has the same colours in their flag as Germany, and both Belgium and Germany unexpectedly embarrassed the favourites, Brazil, in the last two world cups. I&#39;m beginning to see a pattern

Brazil were just insanely unlucky that day lol.. not denying Belgium’s brilliant team and performance but imagine if:- Casemiro wasn’t suspended- Dani Alves wasn’t injured- Tite realized by the time in the knockout stage he should have started Firmino and Douglas Costa(when fit) over Jesus and Willian.. which he should’ve done it in around the final Group Stage matchday(against Serbia).This would’ve been a completely different story but who knows how much different though.. would’ve given Belgium some trouble… and could have slightly beaten France in the semi and destroy Croatia in the final should Brazil have gone through imo.

I don&#39;t understand why people think Belgium is far better than Brazil. They won 2-1 by an own goal and brazil dominated the whole game, just couldn&#39;t find the net. You win some you lose some. That saying, there is no superiority between Brazil and Belgium.

Belgium win for Courtois wonderful goalkeeping

It's funny to see Neymar, a total failure who only lives off his dreams in the Copa América but in the World Cup, anyone can do it mi3rd4 🤣
<a href="">1:45</a> ter stegen could never do this

Here I am three years later, I could win 😭
If Casemiro was in the game I would want to see Belgium do something 🙅🏾‍♂️
To be honest Brazil dominated d match but on receiving end

This hurts to watch as a Brazilian. We fought so hard and tried our best but it just wasn’t meant to be. Being born in 1998 I didn’t get to see the celebration in 2002 and I wanna see my nation lift that trophy so bad, must be the best feeling in the world

Who is watching 2021

That strike from De Bruyne from the replay behind him is like an arrow into the bottom corner.

Heartbreaking Match..💔!!
Brazilian but BORN IN BELGIUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Belgium was who i was cheering for and Belgium&#39;s victory was my lucky day

Thanks for the video

Going on 3 years☹️..Time Passed Very Fast😌

Goosebumps from that De Bruyne goal everytime I see it and I&#39;m not  Belgian in the slightest

Western European nations destroyed brazil like they were asian giants not 5 time world cup winner 1-7 Germany 0-3 Netherlands1-2 Belgium They concede 12 goals and scored just 2. -10 grade

Still hurts me...
Ik I am late BUT I am watching the hilights and I remember in this moment when they scored the 2ed goal I said will it be 2014 over again 😫 I hope brazil win 2022 world cup

and then France had to come along and ruin it all

A sad day for me because my familiar died and Brazil lost

Hazard played one of the best matches of his career..not for the highlights...

Brazil or Argentina champion of the 2022 World Cup
Courtois was a beast in this match 🔥🔥

Lukaku was fired up😊😊though

I don&#39;t like Brasil to win and I don&#39;t like belgum to lose

Here we are, 3 years later, a few hours before the Euros start. I hope Belgium play the best.

This is the revenge of fifa world cup 2002 group of 16.

At least they haven't given you 7
I would like to know what would have happened in a Brazil - France semi-final match...
Couldn&#39;t believe that Brazil would lose to Belgium,but Belgium really played well.hope to see Brazil shine in upcoming world cup 2022❤️

So SHOCKING that Brazil was defeated by Belgium in 2018.

When Brazil fans complaining Neymar not in 2014 qfIn 2018 they even had countino, firminoThose 5tropies from Pele and Ronaldo periodNot anymore

Our VIVA BRAZIL 😘❤👑🔥
I hate Brazil, they’re racist asf! Glad they lost. But I have to admit that we Belgians were lucky that game.

I thought Neymar scored in the last minute but courtois&#39;s save broke Brazilian fans heart.... such an unbelievable save that was.

This is CALL luck, well played  brasil....  You were outstanding ..

Lukaku at <a href="">0:52</a>😂😂

When I 1st heard about this match I said Brazil&#39;s gonna win this. I decided to google the score when I was eating breakfast. When I found out the score I spit out my cereal.

Cortouis in belgium: B E A S T Cortouis in real madrid: T R A S H

Where was the ruling? Are there two penalties for Brazil? !!! And what was the referees doing v a r

Why they always call Brazil favourites, although they haven&#39;t been favourites since I dunno... 2006

Gotta feel for brazil

4:3 match, 2:1 result

I am fans of Brazil but the only thing I can say is that this Brazil is kk it is not the Brazil that was scary the 3R's Adriano juninho kaka Roberto Carlos robinho and etc. If the legends from before had been there I would have left it at 10 Brazil 2 Belgium but Neymar arrived and it's kk
i wonder who disliked this video

Thanks Belgium
De Bruyne shot a f*cking Missile
Why did they say &quot;what is going on here?&quot; as if Belgium is bad and Brazil was gonna win lol.

I knew Belgium will destroy Brazil

The best team in Africa is the Tunisian national team 🦅🇹🇳🦅

<a href="">0:47</a>You don’t realize how fast they’re playing until you see a POV like this

The favourites? 🤦🏾‍♂️ France didn’t exist in the World Cup..
Real ones remember this as the day Hazard won the debate vs Neymar. Levels.

I am the fan of Belgium 🇧🇪 national team

courtious was so much solid in that match and Allison was so much faul in that match

Marcelo, instead of jumping in front of the ball to try to at least deflect the shot, turns around and kicks his butt, so for a guy like that, he should never return to the national team after a move like that! And that other fool Fernandinho 😵😵
this day was sad
Brazil played better
so close coutinho loss in the shot

We gave these thieves a great show, they robbed us in the middle of the World Cup, a shame!🇧🇷
Trash defending by Brazilian Defenders. What a poor marking from Marcelo he should quit bruh

❤️GLORY TO GOD ❤️🙏
Kd bruyne&#39;s goal is faster than my WiFi

Favourites? Come on the Brazil 2014 and 2018 sides were so overrated. They don’t even light a candle to the great times from the 2006 World Cup and before.

Honestly Many people did not feel bad for Brazil being knocked out by Belgium. Neymars theatrics throughout the tournament were to blame.

What a save,and they say keylor is better than thibaut

DeBrune the visionist

Hi from France, just passing by ... : )

<a href="">1:46</a>

The only team that had competition and played extremely well were belgium and france. Thier match too was very interesting to watch. And umtitis goal was kinda fluke. Both the teams deserved the cup.

&#39;the favorites are gone&#39;? whutt?? Belgium were actually the favorites that world cup, though..

De Bruyne Man of the Match against Brazil. He&#39;s Man of the Match again, for Manchester City against Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League 2020/2021

Still hurts!
I was going to cry that day ngl

Butter Toffees??

This keeper is in the MOOD

That last save was Lit.

Belgium Is a winner of world cup in my eyes

Lukaku its a tank crazy 50 mtrs and De Bruyne ..... pffff! This goal and the goal vs Japon are best goal of wc18

Well, we are 3 years later now , and Belgium is still number 1 on FIFA ranking.  This evening : Belgium - Belarus : 8-0 !

Well played brazil, but belgium 👌

Belgium. KDB FAN INDIA, KERALA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
At least we didn't give up until the end
Paulinho and Fenandinho had to kill the play and not be afraid of getting a yellow card for Belgium's second goal
good luck

Courtois save is legendary because that is a legendary kick by neymar .

Really? I thought we all agreed France and Belgium were the favourites!

I&#39;m English but this world Cup I fell in love with this Belgium side they are just unreal

Belgium gotta take the opportunity while they have this generation. It&#39;s a rly excellent team with remarkable players

Brazilians: No brazil must to winI: BELGIUM, BELGIUM GOOOOL
<a href="">1:45</a> If Neymar didn't kick low enough it would be a different story.
De Bruyne, Hazard, Cortouis, Lukaku, etc...this belgian squad has to be one of my favorites squads of all time

The best revenge about 1986

Belgium football golden generation
This reminds me what hazard can be in real Madrid

Selecao was complacent against highly inspired red Devils. The defeat was the consequence

World Cups 5x0 😂

Next year, we&#39;ll make history. Just wait and see! 🇧🇷

Belgium, France, and Brazil have been the top 3 ever since the 2018 world cup

It has been, is and will always be a source of inexhaustible pleasure to see the team that won titles with the consent of the depraved narco-pedophile Havelange fall defeated in the World Cup...
Coutinho was Brazils best player

That end match comment was bs. Belgium were not the underdogs, as they were probably the heavy favourites to win the tournament alongside France. Unfortunately, these two teams met at the semis.

Fernandinho! 🖕🏻
Who&#39;s watching in 2021?

Lukaku like a tank
<a href="">0:50</a> when I was watching it live I knew kevin would make a shoot because its his comfort zone and predict if no Brazil player tried to pressure/mark him its going to be a goal... and then a goal. I mean it&#39;s obvious that was a really bad defending.

COURTOUIS

Fernandinho eliminated Brazil from 2 World Cups. By far the worst player who has ever played in the national team and they insisted on him, he always trembles in important games.

In 2002, I won tickets and went to Kobe to watch the match between Brazil and Belgium. Brazil won 2-0 with goals from Ronaldo and Rivaldo. I watched it thinking that Belgium had gotten their revenge 16 years later.
The Brazilian team played a lot with a great team
Here&#39;s Lukaku now, Like a tank... great word painting
At <a href="">0:52</a> . Lukaku looks like playing PS and he is control De Bruyne. LOL

Brazil got eliminated in a pretty darn similar way this world cup as 20102010- 2018 similarities- Eliminated in quarter finals- Eliminated by a European country- Lost with a score board 2-1- Brazil scored an own goal for opposing team.

In this World Cup the small teams got bigger
<a href="">1:52</a> &quot;The favourites are gone&quot;Really? Since when were Brazil the favourites in this WC? 🤔

You see how happy people are with their teams scoring? You can&#39;t tell me any other sport is better than this beautiful game

Belgium got revenge for Columbia as they were beaten in the same manner in the 2014 world cup

Brazil should have equalised they  DESTROYED belgium in the second half. Brazil was sooooo unlucky.

Girls: Boys have no feelingsBoys: <a href="">1:44</a> :&#39;(

Brasil1 x belgica2
Of metal
magnetic baloon
Brazil 🤩
I don&#39;t  see why Brazil are favorites every cup they are like ac milan

if it weren&#39;t for that goalkeeper belgium was chipped

Once again, Brazil lose a World Cup quarter final and contribute to their own downfall.

If it wasn't for Cortua, Brazil always pressures you.
Brazil best

Brazil practically eliminated, and they celebrate the goal; -; lol

Beautiful by De Bruyne

Why is Thiago Silva not even going for the ball

Can’t believe it’s already 2 years

Neymar always gets scared against best teams of a league. That&#39;s why he also lost against bayern 😔

great game

Haha 🇩🇪7x1🇧🇷
Watching WC 2018 highlights marathonly

Brazil fans feeling same as india feel after india out of wc2019😭😭😭😭

Fifa wc18 is rise of mbappe

Fernandinho was Belgium&#39;s best player in the match.

❤️ GLORY TO GOD ❤️🙏
a pity the lightning does not fall in the same place 2 times: VFrance, 2018

The whole &quot;De Bruyne... De Bruuuyyynnneeeee.. 2 nil&quot; bit always gets me.

It should be Belgium win the world cup 2018Next time Belgium will make  I think so

COURTOIS AND HIS AMAZING SAVES.

Fun fact: if ederson had played In this match for Brazil they would have beat Belgium

Neymar clown Neymar crying the best of the video
1: 09 IF YOU SEE ITS A MEXICO FLAG, I AM SURE THEY ARE WATCHING THE REVENGE OF BELGIUM BECAUSE BRAZIL ELIMINATES MEXICO. I MEAN THAT THERE WAS A FLAG OF MEXICO BECAUSE WE MEXICANS ARE WATCHING OUR REVENGE AGAINST THEM XD, IF YOU GET IN WITH MEXICO, IT'S YOUR KARMA 😂😎👊, ANYONE WHO SPEAKS SPANISH??

Brazil attacked so much that they deserved to pass, what nonsense to see Belgium with their figures and think that they were better than Brazil, when when I see the game there were 4 arrivals and to defend, in the second half they did nothing, they placed 3 center backs and two flankers and still That's how they didn't stop Brazil... The France-Belgium game was more boring, I'm surprised that France didn't attack, maybe if Brazil had passed I prefer to think we would have seen the best game of the World Cup, a very cold championship, which needed to close better, although My respects to Croatia, which came out to play and not speculate like Belgium does, a selection of names, but it is not even close to what the great teams in the world are, when they believe it and play as they should, they will deserve respect, for the rest like that it's football...
LIVE BELGIUM :D
The way de bruyne hit that ball 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 can only applaud it what a strike

Renato Augusto have 2 best chance, only managed to score one

you know what? De Bruyne&#39;s goal is lowkey the best goal of the entire World Cup

I know this seems a bit mean, but their is something that satisfies me about seeing Brazil lose

Sad moment heartbroken with the result of this match This is from a Brazil fan

De Bruyneeeee 2-0
Brazil ❤❤❤❤
Aka alison

Brazil 1-2 Belgium Quarterfinals
<a href="">1:02</a> wow

And now Neymar and Courtois are playing amoung us together

Favorite in World Cup is Brazil body laws

QUE HACE COURTOIS !!!!!!!!!!!xD

BRAZIL had to win.
Courtua to belgiums rescuee wowowoow

That belgium goalkeeper was so very great

Courtois no rage ! 🇫🇷 the champ is France !

The Spanish comment you were looking for :D
When this happened I wrote a song called &quot;Out With The Brazilian Cheat&quot;

Brazil deserves it, it's about time
better than yedi bir

&quot;Renê&quot; Augusto should have started.

There is nothing more satisfying than seeing Brazil lose Football matches

I come to brighten your day :v
Courtois was on top🔥

I don&#39;t think Belgium pulled off an upset. They were my favourites to win this game.

Carried out on 07/06/2018
Here I will come to de-stress remembering that Belgium has Brazil as a son
Belgium 👿
To be honest, I don't even like raspberry muffins
EXCELLENT BELGIUM
Belgium will be finalists in the next world cup

belgium could have made it 3-0 before half time. that would have about settled matters

I want to give a special thanks to my Brazilian Fam that’s helping me with my casino slot game in their country. Diamond 7 (Android), again thanks friends and family!!

<a href="">0:52</a> I just sit and observe

Without neymar brazil always lost

Now you can talk Kevin

<a href="">0:53</a> Ouchhhhhhhh

Poor Ali and firmino

Kamal spotter 8-2 walk 3
De bruyne the best midfielder in the world

&#39;&#39;What was going on&quot;? Belgium were the favourites, not Brazil.

Super goal by audusto

2-1 Belgium did I spoil it

Why Belgium have to be 3rd and not england

Brazil 1-7germany 0-2south Korea
I think Belguim deserved to win it this year.

<a href="">0:52</a>

Belgian tactics is counter attack and high ball heading use fellani  for score...

&quot;the favourites are gone&quot; cmon man i know brasil was always insane back in the days but are they really still favourites nowdays? without ronaldo, r.carlos, rivaldo, ronaldinho and many many more? no they are definetly not

Here the Brazilians are worth it haahhaaahahaha
This game would have been a turn around if Casemiro was playing!!!

That shot from Neymar was perfect, amazing save by Courtois

It sad that this Brazil generation that had so much potential and players like Neymar, Coutinho, Firmino, Marcelo, Dani Alves couldn’t win the World Cup. There chance was at home against Germany but got battered 7-1, meanwhile there rivals went to the final and almost won, Brazilians are lucky the Argentinians didn’t win because if they did, it would’ve been a shock for the hosts.

I supported Brazil from Peru

The thunderous goal of Kevin de Bruyne was surely the turning point.

What a game❤️🔥🔥
Those two goals were made by hazards play

Brazil is no longer like before when there was King Pelé or Ronaldo or Ronaldinho or rivaldo or Roberto Carlos
Ha ha ha
Fernandinho&#39;s own goal (0-1)Kevin De bruyne&#39;s extra goal (0-2)Augusto&#39;s Rally Goal (1-2)Full Time 1-2Eliminated Brazil&#39;s quarterfinals and advanced to the Belgian semifinals

Even now that i know we lost, every time i see renato augustos goal i feel gousebumps! It realy brought us hope! But sadly one team had to lose.

<a href="">1:08</a> just add corner

I miss you kompany 😭
WHY DIDN’T THIS BALL GO IN BRO??? GO SIFUDEEEEEE
