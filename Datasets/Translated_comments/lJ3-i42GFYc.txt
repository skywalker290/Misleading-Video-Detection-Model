Tiger Zinda Hai is 3 stars...I don't want to give you a review.
This man gave 4 star for thappad and 3.5 for tiger Zinda hai🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Abe masand kabhi khud ko dekha hai....lol

Am I the only one taking this guy seriously ?

It was like one of the best Bollywood action sequence drama. But Salman had done it so it will always be under rated. But we are here for him his millions fan for him. Don&#39;t judge him. Wish him luck and love if possible.

For me katrina kaif shines out
Salman Khan fans butthurt in comments 😂😂

Jhutha.. u must get money from producers for the publicity through reviews. Sucker!! Movie wasnt good. Instead of that appraising is crime.

I don't have the courage..can you give me 1.5 stars?
Gandu sale movie me pata chalta he ke nai mast movie
He still gave it 3/5, even after explaining that it&#39;s a garbage.

Tiger Zinda Hai SUCKS!😝😭I want another BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN from Salman Khan sir!🙏🙏

A very True review by Rajeev Masand!👎😣SULTAN was a way better &amp; MOTIVATING movie!😍

Who are u to critisize movies that make audience sit in theatres for 2-3 hours when u fail to make even a 4 minutes Video that is watchable?

What you think you are.......its called entertainment,you fool.

5 / 5 star flim
if u give 0 also fans doesn&#39;t care about it

Rajeev!! Grow up n give some respect n praise to typical Bollywood movies which is creating its own identity n popularity across the globe.

Not really
3 stars from you means actually 4.5 stars !

Well since everyone praising the movie, rajeev thought of bashing it to be in limelight

I haven't seen the movie🎬 it's amazing
You motherfucker, you will make a film, you will act in the film… then you will talk to me.. and you will talk to me in India.. there is no need to talk in Hindi..
In here USA when I see a lot people enjoying this move ,clapping, cheering even though they are not Indian . I am not Indian but salman fan . I know every Indian feel proud when they see world wide people enjoying their movie expect some idiot like this Rajeev!!!!!

Sala kuta

fantastic movie... must watch

giving bad review is simple but making film is very difficult it is hard work of all persons.

Like his psuedo friend A chopra   if this was a Hollywood film you would not have said it was unrealistic. Western Sepoy. Lousy review

Chutiya room i
Bakchod sala....<a href="">#rajeev</a>

I wasted <a href="">4:03</a>mins of my life 😂😂😂Worst review I&#39;ve seen in my life! Why dnt you first learn how to review a movie...

According to Tmhry review 3.5 dny is required but chlo 3 hi sahi.
For which movie did you gave 5/5.And did the Box office collection was even near to Salman&#39;s movies....I hope you reply.

I don't care about anyone to say that Salmaan's movie is crazy. I have seen the movie or I have said that it is really a crazy movie.. Christmas or New Year is spent with the family.. give the money to someone in need. ..
You like to watch Hindi movies. And please give movie review. There is no one like him in India.
I just simply don’t understand what these type of people are looking in a movie. Superman Batman Thor WW ... does these movies make any sense? Still people go to watch to get entertained. There is already so much drama in our life going on ... who would like to waste time and money to watch the same boring dramas. Lol. Just to make personal vendettas out of SK ... these people are making such reviews. Either they are simple haters of SK, or got paid to do so, or simply moron by instinct.

super film tzh e

Most boring review ever seen

Try to speak hindi this is india not uk or usa or canada or some other Foreign country. think before you speak lad.

Fair enough

You are stupid..Rajeev
There is a movie, brother.. Who made it? What do you know about the critics? The only enemy is the log..
Tu chyatya no.1 abe movie hai kese log bhagwan banke hai......Nikal yaha se......Hum ko to bht fun aaya.
If it&#39;s Hollywood u will loud it

Such a bad review by rajeev masand

Hello it is a film watch it only for entertainment. Its not reality.
