Infernal james ️️
no klose?  none at all from Best Game Ever (germany annihilating host brazil)???

2024?

I believe my psychiatrist would tell me to take easy on the 2014 World Cup nostalgia, but I would ignore him. That tournament seems like the greatest football competition ever played.

Spain had a lot of big names still but they were trash this whole World Cup looks crazy looking back seeing their line ups

I wonder what happened to James Rodriguez 

Maradona said if Falcao was playing in 2014, Colombia would have won the world cup!!!

Robin van drukie oh my work
James Rodriguez astonishing goal
Mario Goretze for Germany a hundred and twelve minutes

David Luiz extraordinary goal
Tim Cahill astonishing goal

David Villa oh great finish
Lionel Messi stylish finish
Messi strikes extraordinary
vam persie goal was extra next level

Germany played their worst game of the tournament  in the final, that&#39;s for sure... If Messi played 50% of what he played in the group stage, Argentina would win their 3rd world cup in 2014...

hit by James Rodriguez astonishing goal

Robin van Pressie oh my work
James Rodriguez astonishing goal
Mario Goretze for Germany a hundred and twelve minutes

David Luiz extraordinary goal
Tim Cahill astonishing goal

David Villa oh great finish
Lionel Messi stylish finish
Lionel Messi exordinary goal
Xheandra Shaquri he scored a wonderful goal

Messi was magical 

The flying dutchman.For me no. 1

Where is Yassin Ibrahimi&#39;s goal, you deceivers?  
For me, Gotze's and Messi's number 8 are not cool, they would have put Gio 2 Santos's vs Holland better.

Who is watching in 2024?

still came back to watch after 10 years

The Best World Cup Ever,I Love Robin Van Persie Header When Againts Spain,Because Was Iconic ️
Cahill&#39;s was better than 6th. Would put it 2nd to be honest. That&#39;s such a difficult skill and what a clean strike.

Many great goals that World Cup but is FIFA actually suggesting that Tim Cahill`s goal was only the 6th best of the tournament? It was on his weak foot and the player had to watch the ball come in from high out of the sun. I think it should be no.1.

Easy 7 of germany vs brazil. 2 of lio vs nigeria ,other lio against iran

2024 gangs 
Tim Cahill was the best goal for me
Rodrigues and Van Persie 
Cahill&#39;s goal should be higher in the rank.

Anyone knows what the song in the video is?

Where are messi goal vs Iran

Zzzzzzzzz
Very amazing

Wow

Where is prison? 🇵🇹
Mario Götze in the final 1-0 against Argentina. Yes, what a goal...to the title, awesome.
Mario Goetze, instead of Götze on the fifa channel...

ERA GOL DE YEPES!!!

Road James colombia 2026
I think van persie&#39;s goal was the best.

10 years ago!

To think this was 10 years ago (use translator)
We Are One fammily love  yoursell

Even though FIFA and media did not give the credit it deserves, that goal has become one of the most trademark goals in the history of football.The most iconic goal I have ever seen on a football pitch.. it was really insane.I am not even describing the goal but anyone with football knowledge who reads this comment would understang whos goal it is. That alone tells you how underrated that goal is.

Messi Messi. Sadly they couldn&#39;t beat Germany in the finals

This World Cup was pure magic.

Song name please

Cahill n van

Nostalgia 
For me the best goal is missing: Schürrles 7:0 against Brazil. When you make such a goal in EA Sports FC you get banned from the server.

Wh is watching this own 2023

Maturing is realising Cahill&#39;s goal is better then Rodriguez.

legends say that james rodriguez stayed in brazil

<a href="">1:20</a> - This is an own goal. Without the deflection it was a miss

Cahill at #6 is insane

The shore 
The Bosnia defender vs Messi
I ruined my career by moving to real life)
I dont think cahills goal was better than tha luiz freekick

I still think Cahill&#39;s volley was goal of the tournament. It was incredible.

amazing james rodriguez
Someone who sees this in 2023 out of nostalgia like yes yes
Song title?
&quot;It is David Luiz...&quot;

Just imagine Falcao playing that World Cup with prime James... 

Amen

Colombia lost to Brasil, Colombia injured their best player,  Brasil loses to Germany.

What about the G.O.A.T vs Iran? 🇦🇷 ️
Please take me back to those times man

LEO IS THE BEST.....

This was the World Cup with the slickest Goals. Everyone had the touch of 2010 Forlan

What&#39;s this music? Anyone knows?

name song?
Van Persie's best goal
That goal from Gotze wasn't even supposed to be there
What is the song called or music background

Watching this beauties September 2023

Tim cahill should be one. The playmaking is 10/10 the touching 10/10 the gol 11/10

Who is watching in 2023?
Messi is emotion India loves messi

James' goal is the best goal in the history of the World Cup. Because of its complexity, the way he takes the ball almost with his shoulder with his back to the goal, without letting it fall, he volleys it with his left foot and sends it to where the goalkeeper will never reach, hits the crossbar and enters the goal. It is perfect
James was a true legeng. He is my favourite  player

GOL CAREMONDA!!!

Wow

Who's watching in 2023?
goal #2 should have been #1

alright. we aren&#39;t up there with the rest of the world in soccer, but we have one goal in the top 10 from this world cup. im from Australia. tim cahill...

Background song name?

I was at the Colombia vs Uruguay game with my brother. Two grown men crying when James scored that. I can&#39;t explain the emotion but t this days the best memory I&#39;ve ever had with my little brother. Of course we are Colombians.

Neymar and James lit up the 2014 World cup

BEM VINDO AO TRIKAS

Schürrle&#39;s second goal against Brazil? Mario Götze&#39;s goal should be first. But instead you put pessi&#39;s goal 1000 times 

2010-2014 my favorite WC’s of all time

2023

They should have removed one from Messi for the one from Robben, which was phenomenal.
Does anybody watching this video in 2023?

Tim Cahill deserves higher

It's already been 9 years since the 2014 Brazil World Cup was held! Nevertheless, the goals of the players in this video are unbelievable. In particular, I feel like Lionel Messi showed great performance in this World Cup, which makes me happier as a fan of Messi.
Who&#39;s watching in 2023?

Rodriguez and van Persie 
This WC was 4 years after my nation had pass away yes RIP Brasil Futebol 1958 to 2006 we had players to scare other nations now we where luck the against Senegal the game was only 90min with 20min more if you wach that friendly would be another 7

Name of the music?

The 2014 World Cup changed the lives and careers of players such as Keylor Navas and James Rodriguez who were signed by Real Madrid and won the Champions League....
2023 was12 times better than2014+2018.very nice

im a messi fan but the goal against nigeria, the galkeeper could have saved that

Mario Gotze had to be number one, tremendous technique and because of the crucial goal
As Homer Simpson would say: MY COUNTRY IS MY COUNTRY

James on fire 

The Duch player should’ve got the best goal guy was like super man

There is no way that Van Persia header was second  that is a joke that it was second.

James Rodriguez, a complete monster
Mario Goetze 
Oh wow¡ I was impressed by James&#39; goal, the one who came first

When does James score one of those goals again?
$32,000 returns in just 16days, my financial life is totally changed

2022 was 10 times better than 2018

When Brazil stole from Colombia ;-;
For me van Persie&#39;s goal is better than all🇭🇹

I see no Ronaldo in this 

Without a doubt van persie scored the best goal of the world cup
better than any world cup, either 22’ i’m happy for argentinaaaaaaa ️️

Yes 2014 is better than 2018

I think Van Persie&#39;s goal is better than James Rodriguez&#39;s one

This World Cup was so incredible, even if my country was eliminated in the quarter-finals, between the 5-1 inflicted on the Spanish by the Netherlands, the jewel of James Rodriguez, the superhero volley of Van Persie to the final victory of Germany against an exceptional Leo Messi during this World Cup, obviously passing by the 7-1 of the Germans against the Brazilians, orphans of an equally incredible Neymar. In short, I would so love to return to this summer of 2014 which was so intense, so emotional and so football too. 8 years this World Cup already, and nobody is about to forget it.

<a href="">1:03</a> offside?

The flying Dutchman

2014 was maybe the best World Cup ever

Bro, WHY ISNT VAN PERSIE&#39;S HEADER AT NUMBER 1?! THAT IS THE BIGGEST INJUSTICE!

JAMES wonder Goal  against Uruguay 🇺🇾 who is watching in 2023

I honestly think Van Persie’s header should be #1. We’ll never see something like that in a World Cup again anytime soon.

Messi was the best player by far in that World Cup.

In this 2023
I think this world cup has the best colors. (İt is not a metaphor.) From everything it has : Ball, stadiums, broadcasting even the grass... To me this is kinda brazillian thing. Giving you pozitive vibes, ( colors were just one of it .) maybe that&#39;s why we loved this wc so much.

Messi loves scoring beautiful goals against Nigeria

Who&#39;s watching 2023?

James Rodriguez is the other name for the 2014 Brazil World Cup 

Tim Cahill&#39;s goal in my opinion is the best Australian international goal what pure beauty!  

James' goal is a spectacular goal against Uruguay
So, No Jermaine Jones but you guys includes David Villa&#39;s goal in this list. Incredible !!

Who&#39;s watching in 2023

I liked Van Persie&#39;s and Mario Goetze&#39;s goals.

Lol there’s so many Messis <a href="">1:12</a>

<a href="">0:41</a>

Altho he lost the finals, in WC 2014, Messi was a different beast altogether. He literally carried his team to the finals

What&#39;s the name of background music tho? Anyone knows?

I never expected to win 2022! 
Love Messi and James' goals!!!
The flying dutchman

What&#39;s the song at minute <a href="">0:01</a>

Who would have known that in 2022 he would win the World Championship
Mario gitze
I&#39;m Brazilian and I watched all of 2014 world cup games in family. My Portuguese grandfather told us that flying header goal by Van Persie was the most beautiful goal he had ever seen in his life.

David Luiz hooooo

For me, no goal from that World Cup compares to Robin van Persie's and he scored it against one of the best goalkeepers.
Messi

I think 2014 and 2022 world cup are the best world cup of this century 🇦🇷️ leo messi.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ WE ARE LUCKY WE HAVE YOU IN OUR TEAM

Van Persie's goal is a masterpiece. I'm glad I was watching the game that very day
wow

W

Should have also included that goal which Messi scored against Iran in 90+1

<b>Messi had one more goal that could be in Top 3</b><b>vs IRAN - 90+1&#39;</b>

2022 was the best than 2018 and even 2014.
Van persie deserves the 1st

BRAZILBra&quot;S&quot;ilBrazil is right No Brazil
Cristiano Ronaldo? 
Oh eh ah!

How incredible was this world cup?
Great... none of them are from Costa Rica. Capi's one was better and Joel Campbell's one! What an offense that they are not there!
Brazil 2014 
Tim Cahill should be top 3 at worst. The technique to volley such a ball with such great accuracy is a thing of only the greats.

Song?

Colombia in 2014 was a very good team, it's a shame that now it is not even a shadow of what it was
FIFA declared this James goal the best!! It hurts the cowardly envy.
2014 World Cup was special. Coming from a Brazil fan. Forever remember the James goal and the Robin goal

How tf did Messi&#39;s incredible Curve goal vs Iran not make this list?

nice video game shared...
Germany's 14 goals were missing 
James Rodriguez wow
James Rodriguez's goal is the best

Great goal from Villa!
For me David Luiz`s kick
Van Persie&#39;s goal looked super spectacular, James&#39; goal I&#39;ve seen repeated on a number of occasions, but let&#39;s admit it, the most technically difficult to execute was the Tim Cahill goal ... anyone that has played football will tell you this!!

Thank you. There are all so fine that the 10th one could well be the 1st!  Ten of the best, really, no ranking needed here.

2018 was the worst cup i have seen by far

JAMES RODRIGUEZ IS MVP OF WORLD CUP 2014... sad to see colombia not even in 2022 world cup 

2014 
2014 and 2010 was much better. In 2018 It looked like Nigeria ia playing in France&#39;s jersey.

Jameeeeeeeeees

Hii Me Fromm 2022
Number 1 has to be Cahill, I know you’re gonna call me a biased Australian, but that goal for anyone who’s played the game knows how hard that is to score. It’s basically robin van persies goal for Man U, but take in to consideration that Cahill is a RIGHT FOOTER, he scored that goal with his LEFT, in which he hasn’t controlled the ball he’s judging it from a long ball probably with spin on it, he’s had to of judged it perfectly hit it right in the middle of his shoe and keep it low enough to stay out of the crowd. Literally it’s a world class goal, 99% would either miss the ball or kick it wide, he’s done the 1% while also hitting it with power. Unbelievable goal! The only thing really you can downgrade about it is the fact it’s fairly close to the goal

Have watched Tim Cahill&#39;s goal a million times still can&#39;t figure out how he didn&#39;t shoot the ball straight to the moon, like most probably would.

LO MAXIMO NO SOY COLOBIANO PERO JUGO TAN BIEN QUE LE IVA FULLLL ESA COPA SIN DUDA DEVIO SER PARA LOS COLOMBIANO

I remember this world cup and i think is the best world cup ever sad for neymar that he got injured

James Rodriguez really lit up this WC. His two goals, are both so highly technically different, but both breath-taking (plus, also the commentary on both of them. Perfectly timed great commentary, can etch a memory of a goal on your brain, forever! ). Also, Cahil&#39;s goal, on his weaker foot deserves a lot more appreciation for its technicality and execution .

Rodriguez what a wasted potential or was it a fluke?

Back to this legendary video siuuuuuu - world cup 2022

I'm here watching this move! So far in this 2022 World Cup, the best goal was from Richarlisson.
Sorry Fifa,Sorry James, but Van Persie&#39;s header was something else.

Where is ozils goal Germany vs ghana

For me persie&#39;s goal is no.1 yess james goal was brilliant but the way that got me shocked was something else man...

I remember the 2014 FIFA World Cup for three reasons. 1. Tim Howard was the human wall.2. Costa Rica knocked Greece out on Penalty kicks in the round of 16.3. Germany thrashing Brazil 7-1.

Cahill&#39;s goal should be in the top 3

#1 goalJames Rodriguez He stopped the ball with his chest and then he immediately executed it with his left foot!The ball never touched the ground!!!Now thats true skill!!!!

i kinda wanna fly emirates now
Why do I remember Van Persie doing a flying header in their orange kit and during a sunny match? Am I the only one who remembered it like that?

He does not. 1 should have been Van Persie's...an incredible goal
best world cup ever
Van Persie&#39;s classic header should be hands down #1 on this list. Nothing beats that. And i&#39;m not even a Dutch supporter

As an Australian I&#39;ve always said Tim Cahill&#39;s goal was better than James&#39; but if you don&#39;t agree with that then surely it should be #2

Barongsai

If the Colombian's was the best, Hold on Argentina
The one between Germany and Argentina when they didn't take the penalty against Pipa Iguain if I remember  they screwed us up for that World Cup
Van Persie!!!

best world cup
<a href="">3:50</a> OHH Offside Goal...

<a href="">4:17</a>

Nigerian keeper could&#39;ve easily got to that

There is no god but God alone, with no partner. To Him belongs dominion and praise, and He is capable of all things
Miss the robben goal vs spain, same game of van persie goal

Your mother's pussy, surely you are English who put the top 4
The 10 position in this video is a goal that is similar to the one that got chosen as number 1 in the 2018 World Cup

number 3,4,1
Remember flying Dutchman

Don&#39;t forget the gold match Algerie 🇩🇿 Vs 🇩🇪 Germany

James' goal, spectacular.
best world cup ever
My skin crawls with James' goals 🇨🇴
Colombia long shoot are really hard well done!!! Love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
miss u James!  the first reason I liked football and Real Madrid was because of James! 

James Rodrigues the best

It’s crazy to think that the only player on this list still playing at the level they were 8 years ago was Messi.

Fifa amazing event   
for me, Van Persie lies on 1

Gotze's. I would put it at 10 because it's not a great goal.
The best in the world
Cahill’s should’ve at least been a 3 or 2

I never understand how enyeama didn’t get to the messi free kick?

Lionel Messy......................The Boss

Just galacos...
Lionel Messi ️
James and Persie’s goals were so phenomenal, still remember watching it live with the fam 

James &amp; RVP goals will always live in my heart! I’ll never forget those moments, where I was and the people I was with memories 

Messi is all around , Goat

Tim Cahills goal being 6th still shocks me till this day. Top 3, Top 2 even like cmon

who’s here days before the 2022 world cup? so excited but nothing could ever beat this world cup.

Coming back here for the thousandth time for another dose of nostalgia for the World Cup atmosphere. And every time I come back here I confirm: that Van Persie goal is one of the best in the history of football.

James club career was meant t so sky rocket after this World Cup but never did unfortunately. However he will always be remembered as the guy who starred the 2014 World Cup. His level was insane

Messi&#39;s second was pite luck

why 3. james rodrouigez
One of the most unpredictable world cups.

Hope Wc 2022 is going to be a one to remember Just like this one. What a wc this was

7 years old and had no Idea what football was. James rodriguez volley was the first goal and shot I had ever see and I fell in love with the sport

Cahill one must be top 3!

van persie goal should be no.1 its out of this world

No God except Allah
nani&#39;s touch in from ronaldo&#39;s cross isn&#39;t here?

Damn, what about Van Persie's goal?

RVP&#39;s goal will forever remain in my mind 
To bad james rodriguez is no longer the same player

Robben’s first goal against Spain should’ve made the list.

Honestly, that James goal is unforgettable, anyone else watching in 2022?🇨🇴
Everyone remember this World  Cup Because it was Just Messi Show  and also Brazil Show !

2022

JAMES RODRIGUEZ WAS AMAZING

Woh&#39;s watching 2022

messi goal vs iran not being in this is such a shame.

It’s hard to choose best goal but I’d give it to Van Persie because I’ve never seen a goal scores like that .

Van Persie’ should’ve been # 1

Man, this should have been the world cup of arguably the greatest player that we have ever witnessed.

Tim Cahill&#39;s goal is clearly the 2nd best

The Dutch were at their peak at this  world cup

Fantastic 
Whos watching this previous at the Qatar World Cup

What is the music???

This was life in its prime 

How is the Jovani do santos goal vs netherlands not on here

Thank you for the video. Can I download the videos uploaded on the FIFA channel and upload them on my YouTube channel?

Toy curao but van persie's goal was better than James jiles qlos
James
James Rodriguez is a genius

Write German
No.1 Robin Van Persie
how can tim cahill's goal be 6th...
Mario Gotze Goal 
What is the background music?

FIFA World cups should always be held at lively nations like Brazil, South Africa and not in boring and dull nations like Russia, Qatar etc, it ruins the fun.

Nice goal.

ALL WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EVERY 4 YEARS AND THE CONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIPS WERE TO BE EVERY 2 YEARS FOR BOTH CLUBS AND NATIONAL TEAMS TO REDUCE BUT THE GAME LOADS THAT PLAYERS HAVE DURING A YEAR THERE WOULD EVEN HAVE ROOM FOR MORE THAN ONE CHAMPIONSHIP THE CUP WORLD CHAMPIONS OF BOTH CLUBS AND TEAMS, EVERY 2 YEARS
IT WOULD BE NICE IF FIFA MADE THE 2030 WORLD CUP WITH 64 PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WITH 4 HOST COUNTRIES TO HONOR THE 100 YEARS OF THE WORLD CUP WITH 16 GROUPS OF 4 CLASSIFYING ONLY THE 1st PLACE IN EACH GROUP WITH 20 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE 14 AFRICA 12 ASIA 6 SOUTH AMERICA 4 NORTH AMERICA 3 CENTRAL AMERICA 1 OCEANIA AND THE CHAMPIONS OF THE 4 HOST COUNTRIES
Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Era Istrefi were far better .

Netherlands humiliated Spain and got their world cup revenge I was supporting Spain and I felt it lolThat van Persie, Robben goal (Netherlands counter attacks) were amazing This is where casillas begin to fall Ramos got his part of humiliation too in this tournamentBut people forget that every player country has it moments, ups and downs and that&#39;s why cristiano and Messi are legends just for playing for more than 15 years and with a top performance

-

this world cup makes me fall in love with football &amp; messi , messi goal vs IRAN also deserves in top 10 - what a curve

The winning goal was number 4? Are you ppl high?‍️
The 2014 world cup is the best I&#39;ve ever watched. best everything. had emotions too.

Mario Gotze the Legendary Subtitution

This World Cup was something else

Half of these goals could be germany vs brazil lol

We will never see a better world cup

James my fav

2022 Still What a Great Goal from James RodríguezJust like Van Persie's 
Is that why James?
honestly, I think van persie should be number one

Best World Cup in my life time 100%

Still the best World Cup of all time!

Van Pierse is number 1 though for sure.

I&#39;ve watch this too many times

2014 wc james rodríguez will forever be my nr 1 with henry and both goats

Show

Yooo i have shirt FIFA 2014 but germany

WC 2010 and 2014 are top 5 world cup tournaments of all time in my opinion.

Germany 7-1 Brazil
3 reasons why we remember 2014 world cup: Germany, Germany, Germany. Nuff said, now whine

The plucky whale chiefly license because platinum preliminarily attract despite a silky yacht. arrogant, pushy paint

I have no idea what scoring criteria was used to vote for the ranking, but Van Persie and Tim Cahill&#39;s goals were easily the top two in my book for difficulty, creativity, technique and execution.

Best World Cup I watched!!! Just games! Young teams that made history like Costa Rica, Algeria, Colombia! Longing!
David Luiz goolta live dekha hoisilo
Van Persie James RodriguezOctapus 
Messi want that title so bad!

Van Persie&#39;s goal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Van Persie should be number one.   You will NEVER again see a header like that.

Of the 2018 world cup, only Pavard&#39;s goal would make it in the top ten of this list. Incredible goals in 2014.

it was a yepes goal
<a href="">2:46</a> the final goal of the world cup which gave the Germans the cup

TIM CAHILL IS 1. GOAL IN THAT WORLD CUP DID YOU SEE LIKE HE IS MUTANT BRAVOOOO TIM

Si

Iniesta BALL for 7th place CLASS

To be honest, long distance shots are my favorite, but Van Persie&#39;s flying header was the most original one and probably the one most people will remember from this world cup.

To me Robin Van persie&#39;s goal is a superhuman finishing. It needs to be number one.

Best goals in the world cup
It's the best goals in the world cup
It's the best goals in the world cup
C&#39;mon.. Van Persie&#39;s goal was the most beautiful one

Van Persie was the best of the lot. No1 was just a Hit and Hope

Messi and Rodriguez ️
Van persie is the Most awesome Goal it set the Tone for a very exciting world cup 2014.

Van Persie's goal is one of those unforgettable goals, a signature that stays with you for a lifetime.
One thing I remember about this world cup:In the morning after Brazil losing 7:1 to Germany, when I came to class I remember i was standard 7 then I was late and the social study teacher was already in class, he teased me with &quot;hi Muhyiddin, I know you&#39;re brazil fan and you lost 7:1 hmm&quot;  how on earth he read my mind 

The top three of the best goals for me are Van Persie&#39;s and James&#39;s against Uruguay

I remember that luiz strike,

the gooooal the world wanted

James Rodriguez is text book pure talent 
For me the most beautiful goal was from the Netherlands
Rip james
This is the same as Messi collection of goals.

Messi's is missing in Iran 
What’s the song been wanting to know for 5 years I see my comment from 5 yrs ago 

<a href="">1:00</a> friendly fire:on

Surely I&#39;m not the only one who will be having classes during the 2022 world cup and will hide the cell phone to be able to watch the games 

This james goal is soo hard damage what the f***, think we never see a goal like this again

For me, the most beautiful goal of the World Cup and one of the most beautiful I've ever seen was from Robin Vam Pérsie against Spain!
James!️
the best goal I&#39;ve seen in the World Cup by James Rodríguez and I&#39;ve never seen something like Messi Ronaldo mbape Neymar Ibrahimovic Lautaro etc and apparently no one will do another similar and

pedreiro&#39;s glove goalkeeper <a href="">0:52</a>
Bruh James was on fire

You missed messi goal vs Iran
The rotten kale immediately print because flower cytologically tremble excluding a cruel unit. extra-large extra-small exuberant, ossified dedication

No GOAT CR7

My Colombia does not qualify for the World Cup today. I don&#39;t know how but one way or another it will be there. Waka waka vibes.

<b>GREAT GOAL by robin van perse</b>
<b>The BRAZUKA ball is cute🇧🇷</b>
<b>GOLAZOOOOOOOOO de AUSTRALIA </b>
The video was great, until they added Germany's goal

The quixotic product continuously bat because ping electrophysiologically need forenenst a berserk medicine. venomous, sparkling use

Colombia 🇨🇴
Schürle! His 7:0 goal against brasil was insane!
Where can I get this soundtrack?

Algeria_and_Cameroon_match_unjust_Bring_us_back_the_match_where_is_FiFA

In 2022 who&#39;s still watching

James rodriguez

Van Persie is the real flying Dutchman

Muslera conceding the best goal 🇹🇷
I&#39;m Colombian 1James Rodríguez 🇨🇴
Robben's goal against Spain had to be on the list
JAMES RODRIGUEZ
JAMES RODRIGUEZ
The previous world cups were legendary but for some reason the 2018 wc lacked that extra something that made the past ones special

my favorite is rodrigez
miss this time

Those last 2 goals were really spectacular!
Name of the beat anyone?

Messi right now is 34 but in the World Cup he was 26 and CR7 was 29

I love football
T

James is the king

For me, Vanpesi's goal was the most beautiful
call me biased if you like, but Tim Cahill was ABSOLUTELY ROBBED. The technique needed to do what he did is so far ahead of any of the other goals in this list.

As an Everton fan this is weird. The 2 best goals were by 2 former players for us. One was playing for us in 2004, the other was playing for us just last year. Both great CAMS but very different players.

Nostalgia
I love you James rodriguze
️ GLORY TO GOD ️
Red Card Of Pepe, Germany-Portugal

Goodbye for this cup
James Rodriguez incredibles goals
Best world cup ever!!! 
Beautiful goals
Colombia gave us a show!

I’m sorry, but Van Persie was cheated out of the top spot here ‍️

For what you were left James...
Number 1 from Persie
<a href="">3:26</a> Ronaldo copied SIUU from him

James's world cup <3
@<a href="">2:13</a>

will always remember this WC as the day goetze saves football

And Cr7 did not play in that World Cup or because there is no outstanding goal from the best record in the world
I do not know what you taking about

Don&#39;t say Real

James is bayern

I name them all for club during that 2 decade top 10 era.

What a Goal From James Rodriguez :O

David luiz innoubliable
Soundtrack?
And remember 112 minutes
This world cup best by far the great goals great games great saves filled with entertainment

Robin van Persie's is better! It's a UNIQUE, beautiful definition.
