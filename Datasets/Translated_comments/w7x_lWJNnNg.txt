If Markiplier was a cat.

It the anime Villans day off there is an episode were the main character trys to talk to a cat but realizes cats have there own language so he meows to the cat and this is exactly what it sounded like 💀

I wonder if he knows Red XIII...

That&#39;s fake af, real cats with laryngeal paralysis have squeaky voices not deep ones, you&#39;re a liar. 🤥👖🔥🔥🔥

Deep fake

I hope one day i have a cat just like jack.

Its ok i still like cats just thr way they are😊

The Kiffness needs to make a song about with this clip!!

The skinwalker posing as my cat be like:

I don’t believe the cat is making the noise, I think he is silent &amp; the guy is doing the noises.

The Barry White of cats imitating Joey Lawrence… Whoa!

This is clearly a joke...

Omg I love him! 😍 what a unique voice lol
From meowing to mewing

thats Tyrone

Autobots ROLL OUT

How real is this though?. It&#39;s that really the cat 🐈.

Niggaa where did you go? No more videos

&quot;Gotham relies on me&quot; ass voice

It sounds like woah and wow that&#39;s crazy that a cat meows in a deep tone

&quot;His voice is a bit deeper than most cats...&quot;&quot;Bow&quot;&quot;Yes sir, sorry sir&quot;

Clearly fake as fuck soon as I heard it. It&#39;s obviously the guy doing it. Naturally everyone is gullible with their sheep brains believing everything. I&#39;d place money on this that it&#39;s fake I&#39;m so confident. It&#39;s not even remotely similar to a cats vocal range or tone even if it was deep. Straight up sounds like the guy in the video.

Cat sounds like valorant players when they hear a female voice

How awesome! Like hes saying wow, woah, yo....so many ways to use his meow for talming cat videos!

I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MILDLY DEEP I CANT💀💀🤣
Guy: this is jackJack:wow.... How... Uhh

“Cease this recording meir human”

Two packs of cigarettes a day will do that to your voice.

That cat is voiced by none other than James Earl Jones.

Bro this is ghost run

How bizzare. I’ve never heard anything like this, didn’t think cats got this deep voiced.  so thanks for the new information! 😊

“I&#39;m just a bachelorI&#39;m looking for a partnerSomeone who knows how to rideWithout even falling off” 🎼

MAO 🗿❤️
Thats hilarious. Does he purr like a jake break on a peterbilt  379?

That&#39;s so funny... Sounds fake 😂

This cat has a deeper meow than a man pumped with all testosterone on Earth.

Sounds like a barfly i kinda know, Big Dave the tarmac, drinks in a bar just around the block from mine. He smokes like 2 packs a day still! Legend.

everytime I see this vid I&#39;m like &quot;WOW&quot;

I was expecting some normal sounding meow at least, not THIS

There is no way thats not a man it sounds so much like a dude

He is a sweetheart❤ and one of a kind

Damn i wish this was real so bad🤣

It sounds like the scene in the grinch when he starts up his sleigh 😂

A buddy of mine works for the USPS as a driver and as he was dropping off mail he heard a cat with a meow like this. He thought it was a guy imitating a cat.

😂😂😂😂

I don&#39;t believe this is real for a second

120k

&quot;This is Jack&quot;&quot;Mowh wowh&quot;He&#39;s so cute btw

Ain&#39;t no F-ing way 😭
Cat&#39;s smoked Camel wide non filters for 10 years....

He needs to pay rent. Lmao

Bro got the rizz voice

That’s definitely not real funny tho

As funny as this is, I have a hard time believing that it&#39;s real.

&quot;When a woman is talking to a man she is attracted to, she will instinctively make her voice higher&quot;girl when talking to me :

dude has big ahh balls

give the cat a damn beer

That cat had some opposite helium

Mah. Waw, mow, mëOw

&quot;WOW 👨&quot;
HOW HE MAKES THAT SOUND?

Sign that cat to an r&amp;b contract.

Yeah, not buying that it&#39;s real. Sorry. Sounds too much like voiceover. If I&#39;m wrong, I retract my statement. Not trying to cause a fight. Just stating my opinion.

My cat is almost a year old and she still sounds like a baby kitten 😂

If Corpse was a cat:

This is fake

Fake.  <i>Some cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: &quot;While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat&#39;s meow, I&#39;ve yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat&#39;s meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn&#39;t change over time!&quot;</i>

*papa n mama doing their thing at bedjack : &quot;wow.&quot;

Years of catnip abuse to get that deep gravelly smokers cat voice 😅

Corpse better have this cat

Bros balls are in the underground

aint no way he %100 trapped a russian man inside of a cat

I suspect this jerk is using sulfur hexafluoride to deepen the cat’s voice

I think the thing isn&#39;t how deep it is, but how human it sounds. It sounds like it was edited, but it isn&#39;t.

This cat&#39;s voice is way lower than mine...

That’s lower than most human males

Get him on the MIC 😂😂😂

BOW

Bro thinks he&#39;s the main character of an action movie 💀.

“Say hi!”<b>”æú”</b>
You need a subwoofer to hear this thing.

That looks so much like my cats sister

This cat identifies as a cow

Man’s testosterone maxing
Average Russian cat:
this just broke my entire wall，how do we pronounce this meow？

Sounds like cow

I believe Jack is asking for chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to return. Jack is based.

LOL😅

That’s a black cat 🐈‍⬛
Me not being able to tell if that is actually the cat meow or if it&#39;s just edited in

I still have a hard time believing this is real, not just a voice over...

Owner: &quot;Can you say hi?&quot;Jack: &quot;nO&quot;

100% a valorant player.
