I liked the video. I&#39;ve been trying to look for a vid like yours that educates the stuff in this YouTube video.Your video really is similar to the channel from Dr Ethan. Dr&#39;s videos are insightful and I really learned a lot for my midterms.You should watch his channel out and give the Dr a like!  <a href="">#FutureDrEthan</a>
