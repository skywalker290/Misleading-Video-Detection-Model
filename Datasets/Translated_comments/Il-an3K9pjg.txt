Who&#39;s here before 1 BILLION !!.-

I love this song so much 😊 My favorite song is 2002!!!
I will always remember..

I was born in 2002
When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤🎉

Who is here in 2024March ❤

We are in this together..I love you ❤️🎉

I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Mm, we were only 11

But acting like grown-ups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;

Well, I guess that was true (ooh)

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to 18

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)

Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love, love, love

my fav music during pandemic ❤

I&#39;ve knew this song since I was eight, I thought when I would be eleven. Time just went to quick though. I&#39;m 11 now 😥 ill be twelve in 4 months. How fast we grow up ✨💜

I have been listening to this song constantly for the past 4 years, but sadly Anne Marie remembers her childhood friend but my childhood friend doesn&#39;t remember me. I was 11 then, she, me and her lips are so painful,,,, she forgets me.  I could not forget, my childhood friend.

I was sentenced to this kind of dimension and subjected to evil and humiliating procedures after the souls and dimension lives they stole a long time ago. And this goes back a long time. Most of the people in the dimension may be copies. And manipulated forms. Why am I in this kind of dimension? And it&#39;s nice. Am I being exposed to unnecessary transactions?

Anyone in 2024? Who is still obsessed with this masterpiece?

Anyone in 2025?? 🤔
As humanity sheds its shell,Escaping hatred, violence, and war,Dear Friend, first and foremost, we are human,Everything else comes after,Humanity discovers itself,Being human shouldn&#39;t be this difficult,On the soul&#39;s day of conversation with God, we were all one,We all answered to God simultaneously,What happened, dear friend,From that day to this, who changed us,Why do our identities differ,Why are we enemies to each other,Isn&#39;t the flowing substance in our veins blood?Don&#39;t we all have the same heart in our bodies?What happened to us, dear friend,How estranged we have become,Is the colorful curtain on our skin to blame,Or is it the piece of flesh in our brains?Tell me, dear friend,In what kind of dream are we,How did we become enemies to each other,Did you choose your parents,Did you decide on the house you&#39;d be born into,Did you choose the city you live in,Did you choose the country you live in,Did you decide on the God you believe in,Did you choose the Prophet you believe in,Tell me, dear friend,Do you really decide everything,Or are you shaped by the people around you,Dear friend, tell me,What is the thing that turned you against me,Tell me, dear friend, tell me,What is the source of your animosity and hatred towards me,In a world so vast,What is this struggle for land,Why kill for a piece of soil,Tell me: if you were on the other side of the one you killed,If every bomb you dropped exploded on you,Would you rejoice or mourn,What is this hatred, what is this animosity,Don&#39;t you know that most of the earth&#39;s land is unused,Or are you killing people using God as an excuse,Or don&#39;t you know? No religion says: &quot;kill the human,&quot;God always advises preserving human life,Are you afraid that God cannot feed 124 billion people on earth,Are you killing out of fear of hunger, eating your brother,Do you think you would be satisfied by eating your brother,Don&#39;t be afraid, a piece of cheese in your hand can also satisfy,Return to your essence, oh human, oh friend,There can be no evil in your essence,You were created for goodness,Take off the shirt woven with your own blood,Put on the cloak made of light,Peace begins with yourself,Go to the mirror, question yourself,Where are you and what are you doing,Will you live to kill people,Or will you live to revive people,By distancing yourself from all thoughts,Ask this only to your essence of humanity,Your essence is pure,You have a purer essence than angels,Purify your soul from all evils,Focus only on goodness and beauty,Question everything, distancing yourself from all thoughts,Search for the essence of truth,You will find, I believe,In your essence, there is peace,You are the light of the earth,Regardless of color, language, race, or thought,Hug as much as you can,Just share your love with me,The whole world needs your love,With sharing your love, nothing will diminish,The essence lives with love,First, peace with all your thoughts,Leave the thoughts you fight behind,Look at everything with love, dear friend,See everything through the eyes of love,Embrace everything with love,Kiss everything with love,The heart is very valuable,Do not break hearts, dear friend,Mend hearts with love,Spread the flower of love around,Do not hurt those around you,Approach all living beings with love,We are all one,Our differences are our richness,We must cherish such great richness,Hug like a lover who doesn&#39;t want to part,Embrace Peace, embrace love,Create a new world for humanity,With peace and love...

Okay
I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Uh, we were only eleven

But acting like grown-ups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;

Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to eighteen

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)

Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love, love, love

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002

Yeah



[Pre-Chorus]

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say



[Chorus]

Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

Oh, now



[Chorus]

Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

No matter how many years pass, this song will stay in our hearts forever!

Here 2023❤️
I don&#39;t kn I&#39;m getting emotional 😅

.

I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Mm, we were only 11

But acting like grown-ups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;

Well, I guess that was true (ooh)

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to 18

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)

Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love, love, love
