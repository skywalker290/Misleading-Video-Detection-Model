The most ridiculous smartphone gadget - <a href="">

Got these when they came out and my opinion hasn&#39;t changed.  These fucking suck. Sound is just OK, battery life sucks and gets no where near the advertised life. With anc turned on and dsee turned on, I can put these in on my way to work and 30 minutes later when I punch in, I&#39;m down to 20% battery remaining. Even with anc and dsee turned off, I STILL get no more than 2 hours at mid volume. The damn things are so heavy they won&#39;t stay in no matter what tips I use and every little bump in the road or movement from walking loosens them further. Every 5 minutes I gotta push them back into my ears. No way could these be used running/jogging/working out.The connectivity is shit as well. Even slight movements of my head get this thing staticy sounding and sometimes can drop the signal completely. This price point is a joke for such a poorly thought out and sloppily developed product.This was the absolute last time I&#39;ll buy a Sony product. Some people are just too easily impressed, considering the reviews from the month between release and when I bought them. Mostly 5 star reviews raving how great everything was. Guess it&#39;s true that most of the population is fairly stupid and blind.

can use this earbud talk to phone like airpod or just listen to music ?

Defenetly this is the best technology channel on youtube😮

Sounds amazing with samsung adapt sound and sony eq.... better than my xm4

Can someone please tell me the name of the beat that starts around <a href="">5:22</a>

Mine stick out of my ear too much I cant fit them in my ear canal I have used the lowest earbud

Wack crap sound shiite.    Rittle sibilant sound, too much treble imo.

What&#39;s the name of the app

pls make a review of sony xm4 in ear I want to know your honest review s

I think its weird that after 3 years, they still cost the same as the new linkbuds s

the software is trush

Guy presenting this buds should get acting award for fake enthusiasm, I bet that if Sony marketing would ask for it he would eat foam tips just to show how tasty Sony tips are. I had those and MX3 was pair of WORST wireless buds I had. Noise canceling doesn&#39;t work like it should. Pairing awful and you have to use their horrible app for most options. Overall bad user experience with mediocre sound. And it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t like Sony as brand absolutely no, but those particular earbuds are simply BAD especially in their initial premium price range.

$230 I think that&#39;s crazy it&#39;s stupid crazy it&#39;s ugly crazy $230 for earbuds that&#39;s ridiculous

Worst product of Sony,, i used not satisfied 😭😭😭😭

Does anyone else come back to this vid just to see Lou do the pointy finger thing and tell Jack he&#39;s dead? Lol

Can I use a 45 watt charger to charge them?

Saw your review and buy this usless earbuds, it&#39;s nice cancellation is really usless...Fake review

Do they have hay Siri command

Can someone please help?????Sony wf - 1000xm3 or JBL tune 230nc?

Does anybody use them for the gym ? Lifting? Running ? Boxing? How do they hold up?

i hate these fucking things.the sound keeps cutting put every time i move.worthless

these earphones are terrible, it  cannot remove the wind noise and also the mic cannot filter out the environmental noise at all when u want to make a phone call in crowded place

Does anyone else experience a shocking sensation especially when using them for phone conversations? Good chance it&#39;s just me but I&#39;m curious lol

they are so shit

Too much bullshit talk, no real information. Goodbye!

Not at bass not good for mee

Just buy today 😅😅

Sony makes quality prdoducts - WF-1000XM3 is very good. Thanks for your good reviews

What app do we download ?

I was gifted these alongside an S10 and they are amazing even in 2022!

The sound quality is good, but they&#39;re not only so bulky that wearing them looks a bit silly, but they also constantly slip and fall off when walking.

Are they compatible with Windows 11? Will i experience a certain lag, or lower frequencies while gaming and chatting at the same time?Still worth getting them in 2022 🤷🏼‍♂️

Cam You connect this to Windows, will still be as good?

Just bought a pair £99 to replace my knackered AirPod Pros. Looking forward to trying them later.

Sadly the item i got was a dud and the retailer wont refund or replace it! Avoid it

I can do without the Bluetooth lights flashing in the evening!!

AirPods pro or these?

I just got mine for a good discount given that it has now been superceded. In my experience Sony always offers great audio quality for the money and these certainly don&#39;t disappoint.

is this the guy who does the show hot ones ?

does it fit small ears???

Noise cancellation its amazing really amazing, product really goood quality

Man U have talent best wishes wolf street

I did discover, however, that if you want the batteries to last for more then an hour in the earbuds you have to switch out all the bells whistles...unless you want to keep putting them on recharge every hour and a half!!

Physically a bit on the large size compared to contemporary phones that have come out in last few months

How do they feel in the ears? Ive been hearing that a lot of people are having issues with the fit

OK but can you work/run in these comfortably?

is there an unbox therapy discount code for these?

“Ya tweet.. Ya Toggle.. Ya Get”

Easily the worst earbuds I’ve ever bought. I’m not the biggest sound expert so maybe this does sound really good but my issue with these are for one they r ugly and second they were so heavy that they’d fall out of my ears constantly no matter which bud size I use. Then they r extremely weak to water. Like I wore em while it snowed and that destroyed the right ear bud. Finally later in my time having them they just wouldn’t connect to my phone anymore.

Superb gadget! 👍 I just ❤️ them!
How do they sound when you talk on the phone?

I would not buy this Sony WF-1000XM3 for more than $50. Check the Sony Headphones connect app. It&#39;s nothing there that can show you on how to pair/connect to your Android phone or any phone! Maybe I couldn&#39;t get a right app, but I tried several time to download the Sony Headphones connect app and it only had 2 pages. Nothing! This is so ridiculous! Never purchase Sony products again in my life! I would buy Master and Dynamic BT earbuds instead! They&#39;re made in USA with more options and they sound much better than this Sony crap! It&#39;s all bull crap!  Shame on Sony Electronics Corperation!

Can people make these videos by calling others and putting like a fan on or a tv on the background. Do they hear you good? People want to chat with others buy they don&#39;t want that dumb neighbor in the background! Is there anybody making a different video?  I see the same videos all over.

waiting review for wf-1000mx4

These earphones are really poor !! Mine have failed just after the warranty run out. I did an internet search, and they are known to fail! Needing a replacement. The new Sony WF-1000XM4 have already started to fail already same issue. My recommendation is to stay away from Sony earphones. VERY EMBARRASSING SONY !!!

It&#39;s shit in a workshop. and the sound chops at least once in each song..

These things are trash, always falls out of my ear.

Can anyone comment on the latency of these things? Like is the audio &quot;behind&quot; video on movies, Youtube, etc.? I&#39;d be using them on a <b>OnePlus 7 Pro</b> with Bluwtooth 5.0 (has A2DP, LE, and aptX HD). Thank you 👌

Best baseball cap ever. Go Jays go!

The price dropped to under 100 Euros. That&#39;s a No-brainer now. Can&#39;t wait to get mine :)

tl;dw

These earbuds suck sooo hard! Not worth anything...👎

Good for them

Okay - just catching up after almost 3 years after this review. So: These are made JUST FOR iPHONES (per the box) correct? That&#39;s unfortunate!

Why did YouTube unsubscribe me from your channel? This is the 3rd time I’ve subscribed.

I&#39;ve just got the same ones based on your review. They&#39;re absolutely brilliant. The noise cancelling feature is ace. A must have. Definitely recommended.

Are they ok for running? Do they fall out?

How have these not dropped in price for 2 years!!!

I used to like you because my friend was fond of you and your reviewes. BUT THEN YOU GOT BOUGHT OUT FOR EVERY PRODUCT. YOU FAKE, YOU GET PAID FOR YOUR REVIEWS. THEY&#39;RE NOT ORIGINAL. NEVER ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT YOUR PRODUCTS. I DON&#39;T TRUST YOU ANYMORE!  UNSUBSCRIBE!

Sound is very poor, in volume and quality. It compresses everything when power is required. Connectivity issues.

is this still a good purchase in 2021 ?

Useless junk. This will be the last thing I&#39;ll ever buy Sony branded.

Great review, thanks! It helped me to choose

If anyone is wondering if these are good wonder no more. I operate heavy equipment for a living the noise canceling is great I can have phone conversation inside cab. The noise canceling works better with doors open than a pair of earplugs. This is my second pair of these and if something happens I&#39;ll buy another set without a doubt.

Still waiting on that wfxm4 vid 🤣

The question is ,,, is it good for the gym? will they fall off while Im running on the threadmill? or weight lifting?

sony powerbombs their keyboards when naming a product.

Are they comfortable and do they stay in your ear 🤔?? That&#39;s the biggest problem I have with in ears. I have the Samsung Galaxy Pros. They are comfortable and great sound, but they end up sliding out of my ear no matter what size cup I have on them lol

<a href="">7:08</a> cutest smile ever ^^
Hey im considering to buy theese, do any of you know if its compatable with a oneplus 8t.

Has anyone heard of the Russian brand CG Pods? People are raving about them. Not one review in English.

If you don&#39;t download the app, does the sound guality differ?

Do we have that SONY app in IOS?

No game has changed i have these and phone calls are horrendous i have to basically shout for someone to hear me.  I have £25 sony headphones that work better than these and im actually truly dissapointed.

Loved this video, helped me a lot in my decision. Now my Sony buds are on their way!

<a href="">6:47</a> well that escalated quickly

Just bought mine.

Edifier is way far better than sony

SOLD

Hey everybody that hates sony, continue what your doin please. I need to get these so i dont have to listen to everyone complain that their beats arent that good anymore

WF-1000XM3 vs beats studio buds review please 😁

Liar
Somehow I don’t like his reviews

Can you use these on a PC?

Its a rubbish, piece of shit, totally useless, not strong connection, i lose connection in every 5 to 10 minutes.. 🤬🤬🤬🤬
my brother bought me 10 dollar bt headphone for my 10th birthday and i was so happy its been 3 years and im still wearing it till this day

Classic unbox therapy. The one which everyone loves. Get back to this setup Lew

Someone recomend these to buy in mid 2021?

The only things that i dont like these is the case sise. Compare to AirPods its so tiny so i can bring it every where

Hi, I&#39;m here to tell you, these earphones are not so great as all these media&#39;s saying. It looks good. And that&#39;s all.  My cheap jabbra 65t are much better than this.  The microphone of that sony are so bad. People you speaking with can hear more the ambient sound than yourself.  That ANC aren&#39;t so great.  And the design of the earbuds itself, are not so comfy.

DO NOT BUY! this ear buds are so uncomfortable that is shocking that no one even talk about it.they are heavy as well.very poor design.They sound amazing, but it is hard to use them for more then 20 mins

Do these have microphone problems like the XM3 headsets do?

Go Jays!! ✌️🇨🇦
I have the WF-XB 700 set and I love them. Great sound. I’m not into noise cancelling because it compresses the sound. I’ve heard complaints that these fall out very easily when running. I’m thinking of buying these.

Ok so I bought these but still dont know if its waterproof or not...Can anyone help me please

Do you recommend to buy this pair of headphones in 2021? I want to buy some wireless headphones, but I can not decide yet what I should buy.

Sony: Why dont people understand our Earbuds name? Also sony: WF 1000XM3 JDGYRIDTYDITFOUTDUKTJUDFYRSUTEXUETX5161928639303

Why does it keep dipping volume and changing the sound all the time . So annoying

Take my money. Love it

Complicated to set up and use, touch sensors are a silly idea and cause no end of trouble when you first get used to them.  Otherwise not bad.  Just need to be more straightforward in operation.

Music name please <a href="">6:02</a>

<a href="">6:50</a> &quot;I can hear you but you&#39;re dead&quot; things got real dark real quick there

It has the worst call quality. I bought a pair last week. Updated it to 8.0.0 but call quality is still very poor. You can google for a &#39;call quality review&#39; from customers not from YouTubers.

School cancelled physical classes and now I&#39;m at home. As my upstairs and downstairs neighbours have negative IQ they all decided to renovate their homes. I have been hearing nothing but drilling for 2 weeks from 10am to 6pm and I just need a good ANC earpiece. The XM4 just came out and I&#39;m hoping the price for the XM3 would drop. Anybody with a XM3? Can you give a review of it?

Saw these going for 50% off their normal retail price and decided to get them after watching this vid because I desperately needed a replacement. I was using the Galaxy buds live and mostly for my gym workouts and they got ruined after popping out whilst I was busy with my workout. Terrible decision! I don&#39;t even know where to start. The only thing going for them is the sound, all other functionality is horrendous. They fall off even when I&#39;m standing still, I&#39;ve tried changing the size of the covers and it still makes no difference. Then there&#39;s the annoying touch sensors which I can&#39;t disable on the app. Whoever is still thinking of buying these (two years after they&#39;ve been released), don&#39;t. Just don&#39;t.

Do a review of Yamaha earbuds

Had these for 1 year... battery on the headset only last 2 hours now. Sound is ok but don&#39;t think I would recommend this to anyone.

Can use 1 at a time

Wow these piece of shit didn&#39;t even say we had to download some fucking app.

WF1000XM4 just came out and let me tell you that now is the best time to buy these! I still love my WF1000XM3&#39;s!

I’m excited I’m getting them next week

What’s the name of the track at <a href="">6:00</a> min??? 🙏🏼

delay letancy for gamming or not amigo ?

Great earbuds, just ordered them... but how did they change the game?

For those wondering how  Sony Names their headphones WH= Wireless HeadphonesWF= Wireless Freedom (earbuds)CH= Casual HeadphonesX= XtremeN= Noise CancellationSP= SportXB= Xtra BassM= Model (WF-1000XM3 meaning Model 3)Numbers 0-1000 just mean the quality of the audio and its price range XB700 vs the WF-SP800N. So likely the WF-SP800N has better overall audio. Then the WF-1000XM3 would probably be better audio and higher MSRP then the WF-SP800N.So for example (WF-SP800N)Wireless Freedom - Sport - 800 (audio quality/price range)- Noise cancellation

Am wearing these now. By far the best I’ve ever had. Am gonna get some more rubber  ear pieces for better fit. But these are the bollocks. Thanks for your review

I just bought this online from the Sony Store. So I hope its the right choice.

If anyone is still here watching this. Don’t recommend. Don’t know why this man is on the edge when describing them but you could do better with your money

Great 👍 SONY company 👏 products
Don&#39;t buy them. Call quality is terrible. Waste of money.

The jabra 75t have their own software..in it you can pick background sounds..the ocean, rain and so on...do these have the same?

Are these sweat 😓 proof? Can you do hardcore workouts 🏃in these?

Is this support water resistant or splashproof???

Sound quality is quite good.Bluetooth connectivity is rather poor, have to put them back into the case and reconnect every other time or so.Also, the app is useless. Many of the features you would want such as &quot;8D music&quot; capabilities are only exclusive to a few obscure music apps I&#39;ve never heard of before.Overall, good quality but doesn&#39;t justify the price tag.Personally, they fall out of my ears quickly and cannot be used in activity. The wide selection of foam tips is nice but didn&#39;t solve the problem for me.

Does any of you experience facial flushing when using these buds? I get a feeling of elevated temperature a bit later with a bit of headache.

A year later these still best in class

I hate them... on phone calls I sound like a damn robot and the person talking to me sound broken up robots....

As someone who’s had these for a while and is about to sell them I would like to leave my own honest review.5/10, and not nearly as good as they’re cracked up to be.Pros:-magnets make dropping earbuds into the case effortless-the noise cancellation is excellent-both case and earphones have tones of battery lifeAudio is very clear and the in-app equaliser allows you to customise the volume for individual frequencies of sounds in order to get the most out of your music, with many different settings for different moods of music.-comes with many different earbud tips for a custom size and depth to fit your ears.-independent left and right touch pads allow you easily toggle between noise canceling and ambient sound modes as well as pause/playing music-good quality microphone for callsHere are the cons though:-incredibly large and chunky earphone case takes up lots of room in your pocket. It’s not so bad if you have a hand bag or backpack to keep it in but if you’re just planning on taking your phone, wallet and keys out in your jeans, finding room for the thing is a nightmare-earphones themselves are equally as chunky with most of the weight hanging outside your ears meaning that they actually fall out really easily. You can’t take these running and I cannot tell you how many times I’ve had to stop to readjust them while dancing, mowing the lawn and chopping wood. I have had to fidget with them constantly. As someone who listens to a lot of metal and loves a good head banging sesh this was a real issue for me that prevented me from fully enjoying my music-the adaptive sound control that automatically toggles noise cancelling/ambient sound modes based on your movement is actually incredibly disfunctional. It creates a temporary pause in the music while switching, and if you’re doing an activity that requires you to start and stop a lot it will cut off your music constantly and just generally interrupts your flow. Especially a problem for when I’ve been chopping wood.-annoying Siri voice prompts-constant trips to the app are necessary to fine tune all the minute settings-occasional software updates for the earphones themselves are needed to even access said settings-earphones look really odd when in ears, not very aesthetically pleasingTo conclude I wanted to compare these earphones to the new set I decided on; the skull candy sesh. Obviously a $99 AUD pair of earbuds wasn’t going to be nearly as good in audio quality as a $200 AUD pair but they sure do come close. My skull candies don’t have as much battery life nor all the other bells and whistles that the Sony’s do but at the end of the day, they’re simple to use, fit very tightly in my ears with no chance of coming out, have a slim and compact charging case, look nicer, don’t agitate my ears with a heaviness the Sony’s did, and have a slightly grittier sound that I really appreciate given my taste for screechy rock and metal. Generally speaking more expensive earphones have a smoother more buttery sound that focuses more on treble, bass and low thumping drum beats, where as cheaper ones have sharper, grittier audio that focuses more on symbols and high hats, vocals and snares. If you love meaningful lyrics and alternative music genres as opposed to mainstream pop songs that focus on reoccurring chord progressions with heavy bass from soundboards, you may want to consider saving yourself some money.All in all if you work an office job and often do set amounts of walking or bus/train rides on your commute to work these are some great earbuds as you can afford to do some toggling for some amazing audio quality, but if you’re a little more active or plan on doing some manual labour or dancing around I’d suggest you keep looking. Will certainly be selling my pair

Awaiting the arrival of my pair. Super excited!

i love this airbuds wf-1000mx3  for me this is better than wh-1000mx3

Hey guys can someone please tell me if these are stable with LDAC set to 990Kbps in developer mode on your Android?

Thank you for recognizing the people like me who get these to mow the lawn!

You didn’t mention anything about sound quality... Miss that...Anyway thanks for the review

Lolijust bought these and after watching this I am thinking I wasn’t nearly as excited for my purchase as I should have been. 😂they’re great but this video just made me alot more excited for em hahaha I hope I don’t lose them 😕

anyone know if they are good for running, they are in sale rn and im trying so see if they are worth  it

Never underestimate the power of Japanese technology. Apple doesn&#39;t stand a chance against Sony in terms of quality

How about calling people? How good is voice reception on the other side?

Now the wf-1000xm4&#39;s are leaked

Damn that case is BIG lol

Thx for the Video. $178.Seriously

I love your channel.

I think you have to preheat them as some sannheisers do. This means just keep them playing music for couple of hours and they will sound better later on.

it keeps falling out of my ear

Jack! Come on, that&#39;s cool, Jack!

Just bought these. Best wireless headphones I have ever  heard!!!

shit beard

Idk if i should get these like right now for 150 euro, or wait for the other version wich will cost like 300+ and will release in august probably. Perhaps the best choice is to wait for it to release so the older one gets even cheaper and then i can decide, but overall what do you think? Personally i feel the high jump in price isnt worth it for stuff like sweat proofing, better battery life and pretty much everything else bcus for 150, the older vers offers so much more in terms of bang for buck.... So lost rn lol

These are $220 in Australia right now (USD $170) bargain

Is this a good noise cancellation for me as a sales person who is always on the call and working from home.

He got paid a bunch for this from Sony. Bet.

Great review! You’ve literally showed every aspect of the user experience! And hats off to SONY for this flawless product! 💯 I’m convinced to buy this 🙌🏻

Great review! You’ve literally showed every aspect of the user experience! And hats off to SONY for this flawless product! 💯

I just got these today

They gotta cut it out with the apps, GTFOH no one is gonna use the damn app.

Definitely do not buy Sony, the wf-1000xm3 right earphone I bought is broken, they sent it to the service, they repaired the battery and sent it back, absolutely the service and product quality is terrible, it can never be like Apple.

Every time this guy opens his mouth my wallet suffers, good job man. You should sell cars

Btw: Sony has some earphones for sports, that are connected behind your head, but no cables.

In my opinion, they still reign Supreme

As someone who is always listening to music, upgrading to my first pair of wireless was the perfect opportunity and I have to say this is the best purchase I have ever made, been around 7 months with them and I like them more by the day and am still finding new features, case is a little beat down but I was extremely surprised when the case didn&#39;t reak when I took a big fall onto them while skateboarding. The case didn&#39;t even chip! It left me with a huge square bruise on my thigh but I&#39;m glad the case was alright.

U re phone ?

Flogger

Love the hat. 😊

Just picked a pair of these up. Still super torn if I made the fight choice with black over the white ones. They are INSANELY comfy. I&#39;ve worn the Galaxy buds a few times. These are just as comfy and hold in the ear very well. Sound fantastic. Super glad I got to see this review. Worth the money. I got mine for less then 200 as well so price has come down some.

Sony:we&#39;re not getting much profit on our mobile phones.Also Sony:We&#39;ll put a higher price on this little one.

They on sale for 178

These things hate beanies let me tell you

If WH means Wireless Headphone. Then WF means Wireless Fidelity. You&#39;re welcome.

These are ba ass just Copt them love the sound

I have ordered just now..I will comment again how good is this

can I connect it to desktop? (not notebook)

<a href="">7:11</a> made me buy these😂

<a href="">7:11</a> that stranger things boys smile😂😂

Does it support wireless charging ?

Any apple users using them ?

These are absolute garbage.  Disconnect and connect constantly.  Too big to move around without them falling out of your ear.  You have to download an invasive app for it to workI bought them after watching this video and I feel duped.

Thanks for the review, im going to purchase mine today!

Sony why doesn&#39;t anyone remember our products names?Also Sony - wf546y46h

These are the best sounding wireless buds period. Much richer sound than Apple.They are also the most unreliable buds out there.. period.Mine flop 2 or of 3 times when I take them out of the case, they just don&#39;t connect, OR they connect at a very low volume!They randomly disconnect either both or one bud.When they connect boy are they good. But they are just too unreliable for day to day use.

the model can only pair to one device at the same time, if you want to pair with another you have to reset the previous paired information and pair to new device.

How are these with a motorcycle helmet on

no offense to apple butI told my friends about this, and they said &quot;airpods r better&quot;I responded with the features of this legendary pair of buds.he responded with &quot;b-b-but it&#39;s apple!&quot; not even joking.

wonder how long the battery will last, phone ones last for 2-3 yrs. cuz you won&#39;t change anything in those, i guess. a single use battery, top notch programmed obsolescence...

The sound and sound canceling are primo on these, BUT they tend to fall out of my ears at the most inopportune times.  Doesn&#39;t matter what size ear tip I use.  Also, not for longer than an hour use at a time IMO.  I prefer the Bose soundwear.

Hey! Does it work with MS Teams application on a laptop (ideally with ANC)?

uhmmmmmm i can hear you now 😊

I have the tan version and I love these

&quot;Of course, one thing there’s no getting around is that the WF-1000XM3s are very specifically not designed for fitness. There’s no sweat proofing or water resistance here.&quot;

What about ip ratings 🤔

Watching this on Sony XM4 headphones lol

Hi, I&#39;m just wondering, how shock proof is it? Thank you for anyone who&#39;s going to reply. Much appreciated.

Testing sound quality of a headset by listening to songs on YT. Uhm. Yeah, about that... -.-

Hmm i would buy this as I know Sony is good at noise cancelling. I m just not sure about battery life after some time of heavy use and regular charging cycles. Any opinion from users please?

Fuck that was a good sales pitch

The vivacious knee disappointingly remain because orange intraperitonally fail including a unbecoming sleep. curved, puzzling wall

Still best in ear nc buds!

Overrated, I regret the purchase. Noise Cancelling just ok, not comfortable to wear and fall off easily. The microphone is terrible and work best when you are in a quiet room. I wasted my money on this.

i bought this after hearing so many rave reviews. but the battery really sucks only last 1.5 hr omg

Mine last for 2 hours and they die after that. Smh

I just came back to this guy from a couple years back and he’s still doing good

My replicas are from iplaypods .co and they are awesome. I love them because they are same as apple ones.

How to turn them off? I don&#39;t want to drain their batteries but I have no idea how to turn them off

Can you please post a comparison video between wf-1000xm3 vs galaxy buds pro? will be looking forward to the anc comparison in details.

I have these and while the tech is great, they don&#39;t stay in my ears. They fall out so easily just after a few seconds of walking around!

Is there a way these can be connected to Macbook Pro laptop via Bluetooth?

Don&#39;t buy there shit

TL;DR: Be cautious if you want to use it cross-device or make calls with it.The sound quality and noise cancellations are good.But not sure if it&#39;s just me, connection is incredibly unstable at times, sometimes it cuts itself off. This I especially the case when I&#39;m switching between my macbook and my smartphone, macbook connection fails to connect or gets dropped all the time.Calling with this headphone was also a headache, most of the time I have to disconnect it so the other person can hear me. Maybe it&#39;s because their mic is in a weird position? Anyway, I had it checked at my local Sony store, they say this is just the way it is, nothing they can do.So when it works, it&#39;s great. But often it doesn&#39;t quite work like expected, and it&#39;s incredibly frustrating.

How’s the bass?

Worst buds possible
I have them and they’re ok

How about for workout?

These are better than advertised. I have these

I would appreciate taking a call with earphones and creating noise around you to see how well it handles calls.

Just a question can I use them on my ps4?

I got mine with the Xperia 5 ii they are nice but i like my steel series arctis 7 gaming headset i use on my phone lol

I bought this a few weeks ago with seeing any of these review videos and I&#39;ve gotta say. These earbuds are AMAZING

Clickbait
Noiiice

Compared to Bose sound sport?

What is the process of connecting wireless earbuds (regardless of manufacturer) when on a plane that requires a head jack connection?

Guys I need help. I will have to study at home next semester due to covid. I live in student housing and people here are animals who parties and scream all the time (day and night). I need some noise-canceling for my studies, both for online classes and for reading (with music) Would you recommend these earbuds? Or should I go after those who go over the ears? Thank you!.

Sony: we need a name for the earphones Sony employee: <b>*Reads his wifi password*</b>Sony: there it is

bald thief!

IMO the best earbuds on the planet, even now on 2021. They are awesome. I&#39;m not going out in lockdown so they are perfect, I repeat perfect for indoor working from home. One major major negative: it takes me so many attempts to get them in the case...I feel like smashing then sometimes

The design should be improved

So question can you only use one earbud at a time left solo? Or right solo??? I am sending back my $230 jabra earbuds for that reason I can only listen to right solo but not the left solo LIKE WTF 😒

Can this cancel out the SNORING?!

After working at bestbuy for a year I settled on Sony as the best value for quality and performance in audio since I was testing all the headphones out every day and i bought their headphones, then in December I got a sony oled, my galaxy buds are wearing out so im definitely getting these, and since Samsung wants to be apple so fucking bad im buying from someone else and Sony is near the top of that list. They really are quietly climbing to the top.

Are the compatible with Sony smart TVs

Compared to my old sony wired earphones which lasted me for years (xba-h3 I think) Im a bit disappointed with these. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong they look great and they do sound good - but I&#39;d rate the SQ at 6/10 vs perhaps 9/10 for my old earphones. Maybe bluetooth just can&#39;t sound as good as wired? Still pretty happy anyway!

These are my go to headphones for everything. ;)

Does it cancel the background  noise while calling thru mic.

volume, what kind of volume. because lets be honest, a typical headphone off a cellphone, not loud enough at all. so is it louder than the volume you get out of a 3.5mm headphone jack, or quieter? because im trying to match my desktop in terms of loudness. i have a soundblaster ae-9 with upgraded opamps (muses 01/03) and then that goes out through RCA to my schiit magni heresy headphone amp, and i crank that bitch when I am jamming. I want the same with my phone/bluetooth. But I can&#39;t seem to get it. so are they really loud? or just &quot;normie&quot; loud?

I&#39;ll be right back I got sell my house and kidney I swear it not tech addiction lmafo

This is so helpful even tho I’m watching this a year later I need ear pods that are light hold in very well in every scenario especially skateboarding because that gets very loud and I also need something to be able to hear cars coming from behind and some good bright / dull color options to help me or another to minimize the risk of losing expensive ear pods

Is $154 a good deal for these Sony?

What a shitshow of a review. Reading crap on the box with stupid music in the background.

Sweet sound, don&#39;t have a thing to complain about. However the comfort is ahhhhhh lacking for me. Owned it for 2 days and returned. No matter the size tip, awful feel after an hour of wear. I don&#39;t think any earbuds are for me. I tried the Bud Live, Bud plus. All feel painful. I am sticking with headphones.

Shop number plz

I have had these earbuds for a month now. The only negative experience from my POV is how small these earbuds are. Out of all the negative things these earbuds are great!

The case doubles as a stand for your phone, open the lid and the small curve works like a stopper.

How are these in terms of working out? Would they last through sweat and water?

if you have sensory processing disorder or just processing disorder do not buy these. get the headphones. these are not adequate at all.

i just got mine today and super unimpressed. i can still hear my fridge and the plane in the sky and the cars all with noise cancelling on :( waste of bucks. (i have the headphones too which are impressive but A. not discreet to go down the road and B they give you a headache from the pressure)

<a href="">5:59</a> my guy using YouTube music.

I’m tryna spend money rn even tho I shouldn’t and I’m at target rn tryna see what I could spend it on💀prbbly on these. I got AirPods v2 rn but no noise cancelling. I’m thinking bout getting these Sony ones

Anyone use those for sports/gym?

Wish MKBHD WOULD REVIEW THESE
I use this headphones with  Sony Xperia 1 ii damnit it&#39;s incredibly amazing sounds going on in your head not ear

Is it compatible to Iphones?

When I Feel Bad I Always Watch Your Video, Your Video Can Clear Some Stress Out,.

Do they work for Ps5 ?

What exact Sony app should one download ? Unable to connect to my Iphone 12 Pro Max.

Those things are freaking huge dude!👎👎

The tip size selection sealed the deal for me, my ears are too small and earbuds just fly away from my ears constantly. Can&#39;t wait to test that one

&quot;Gold tan hue&quot; also known as bronze in some parts of the world

which phone is that?

Just bought my pair, and it&#39;s absolutely fantastic. The NC is really nice and works well, the battery life with NC on is great and lives up to the expectation. Sound quality and bass boost are really good. And the fit is secure and snug and doesnt fall out even of you&#39;re walking fast/lightly headbanging to the great quality sound. Connectivity is super fast with the NFC/Bluetooth. The problem is actually the name, I mean like c&#39;mon Sony. What is wf104847mx283773? Just kidding, but if you are willing to spend some extra bucks on premium headphones, then this is the way. Cheers.

Fuck this hack

it just sucks that these sony ear buds u can not use just one ear bud. When one dies, u cant just use the other. Or is there a way??

Is it loud

Are they better than apple air pods pro and worth the money ?

How is <a href="">7:08</a> not a famous meme? Guy has 17.6M subscribers. MAKE IT A FAMOUS MEME!

Powerbeats pro vs Sony WF - 1000XM3

I own a pair bought them for black friday I definitely would say he was over hyping them but I recommend you turn off the adaptive sound control or else you&#39;ll head a beep everytime you go from sitting, to when you standup, to when you walk around it gets annoying after a while but it&#39;s a nice pair of headphones definitely better than airpods a solid 6.9/10 if you&#39;re looking to pick them up on a deal go for it

I really did not get a good feedback on the Sound , It&#39;s still not covered specifically for audiophiles

<a href="">6:10</a> me when I cheating on a test and the teacher looks at me

I just bought it and I just felt like I was in a different world

u gotta compare products not just say they are all good. like i wanan know whats better, these vs jaybird

is there a second video on a preferred earbud?

they lasted 1 year and they began to make a beeping sound

Are they good for Sony ?

I bet Yoko Taro contributed the name

but will drop

Thanks, man! I bought the earbuds. 😊 So far I&#39;m happy with my choice

pretty clear this video is to sell the product, you reviews on things use to be real, not they are just for sale purpose, understandable for human race.

I absolutely love his face when ges hearing

Does it work well while watching movies? I fear there would be some latency problems in this as with every true wireless earphones. That is why wireless headphones are much better to enjoy watching movies.

6 hours of playtime is simply insufficient for me Dx even with fast charging, that&#39;s just annoying. Can&#39;t even listen throughout my 8hr shift without interrupting my groove

Watching this while on my Sony XM3.Finally I got to say sumthing like that 😆

Does it have a mic?

To me I&#39;m not audiophile but my amateur ears like
Sennheiser’s Headphones have a way better soundstage than Sony. Sony is good at blocking sound. I usually want a headphone that creates sound well though. Also The Sony build quality and customer care is garbage. They flat out denied build problems with their headphones, yet all of them break in the same area.

idk why I&#39;m watching this like I haven&#39;t already had these for a month .. lol , guess I want to make sure there&#39;s nothing I&#39;m missing

while on call another side not listen clear voice

This dude’s face is so unlikeable.

this earphone is bad for connection

Great noise canceling but not as loud as I’d like. Wish it was just a tiny bit louder! Just one - two more clicks louder. Even with the EQ adjusted. Great sound just wish it was louder.

Is it comfortable when laying on your sides?

Cheap review. You just show your first time impressions. No after long time use impressions. The truth is they have big issues: the app is garbage , they fall often.

Man, I’ve completely gotten into the Apple eco system to make my life much simpler and streamlined. I decided to opt for the Sony over the AirPod pros and it’s such a freaking pain to use multiple devices against one ear bud. I have to disconnect from my previous device. Even if my mbp lid is closed, if I left the bt on, or if I have not disconnected the Sony from the laptop, it’ll pair to the laptop. Once manually disconnected, I have to again go back into pairing mode before the phone successfully connects to the ear buds. Not to mention the pointless notification informing me adaptive control is on. I lay my phone on the desk and pace around only for my phone to notify me that it’s adapting, which deafens the music for a couple of seconds. Sure you can turn off notification, but why would they do that in the first place!? I mean it’s just so unnecessary. It reminds me of using windows and trying to deal with the windows registry that kept getting in the way of any server I tried to host. This is why Apple is so popular. It just works. Everything is else is over engineered to the point that it just gets in the way

I miss bass. A lot of bass. I regularly listen to reggae, reggaeton, ska and other bass heavy music. My Sony wired earplugs never failed me.Now I&#39;m thinking about returning these and getting the Jabra 75T&#39;s instead...

Are these worth in 2020?

Number one in the world, very better for airpods pro

Very very good and nice, very better for airpods pro

the reaction at <a href="">7:05</a>

Jaaaaack boy, loook dady is happy :D guys your amazing ;)

next time test the microphone...

I got Sony WH-1000XM2 a while ago for pretty cheap, amazing crafted headphones, extremely comfortable, but the sound was not exactly what I was looking for, my B&amp;O sounded way ahead and I sold the sonys for profit. Now I got those airports also for pretty cheap, sooo if somebody wants to buy..  :]

horrible individual... how the heck can he do 5 mil views? horrible

my brother and i ordered them and they arrived todaythey are epic

how many hours charging sir ?

Hi there.  We have been trying to reach out to you for a similar video for our Nokia Power Ear buds.  Please tell us how to best reach you.  Thanks

Me : What&#39;s the new earbuds name?Sony : Yes

I don&#39;t own them but the case seems chunky compared to others

These work with apple right?

I made a mistake of buying Galaxy Bud Plus over these .I am feeling sad now ☹️ .

Sony perfected the naming of gaming consoles but somehow fucking up the names of every thing else.

<a href="">7:09</a> you look like Dustin from stranger things lmao

the only problem with these is that they are not splash proof

Great Vid!! Heard with GLORIOUS SONY WF-1000XM3&#39;S buds just received today from...well you know who ;} I also was an &#39;over the ear&#39; man (Sure!)

airpods or sony WF to buy idk

SONY: More tips next time, especially “flange”. I ALMOST returned these because NONE of the tips fit. I bought a 6-pair set of flange tips for $15 on Ebay and they’re amazing now. I rip around the city on my electric scooter and they never fall out. With flange tips and ANC, I run a table saw &amp; shop vac simultaneously and have forgotten to turn the vacuum off because I can’t hear it.

Can they filter put hums and noises and pass through the voice.

I have wh1000xm3 overear. Now i wanna save for this one too omg.

Between these and Bose soundsport truly wireless earbuds or Bose quiet comfort earbuds that were just released, which is better for audio quality? Thanks

Hi Lewis. Thank you so much for the amazing review. Would you recommend these over the galaxy buds plus or the galaxy buds live?

Yoz can&#39;t use bluetooth on an airplane😂😂 lol

Why does everything else changes your game ffs💀.

The only thing that&#39;s a turn off for me is the size of the case. One of the things that&#39;s important imo is keeping the cases compact so that it can easily fit in your pocket and take it anywhere. You could technically still do this with those earbuds, but it&#39;s looks like a bigger pain to have than what other competitors are doing. I mean, you&#39;re really only using the case to carry and charge your earbuds so i don&#39;t get why they needed to make the case huge. It just feels like an oversight in terms of design.

Can this channel really be trusted anymore? 17.5 million subs.

Based on my experience I would not buy these again. You can read all the reviews and do your own research and I must have bought one of the many defective pairs. They work fine for a while (and the sound is amazing) then days of connection issues, with blue tooth constantly dropping and for perspective it can be 10 or more times in an hour. Reset this, do that blah blah blah - but why should I, why is Sony selling a product with so many poor reviews. Had a really bad run this week of everyday poor performance (after months of them working great) and I am sending them back. I also use a wireless Jabra headset and Skull candy wireless and never dropped once, no issues with these products on the same device. Also, for me they worked well for walking but couldn&#39;t use them at the gym as they would literally fall out of my ear - YMMV here.

Yeah but I can&#39;t use them during workouts :(

just had these wf1000mx3s and was very disappointed.  yes great sound for ear buds, noice cancelling great but unfortunate not being able to have all the options available and with a volume control sucks.  either i have all my controls for music on one ear and then the other hac volume control or all the music controls on one ear with noise cancelling on the other ear but you dont have volume control.  that is the reason i returned mine.  i like nc and control of nc while playing music and changing volume depending on those certain louder songs and the wh1000ms cant do that.  if id known in advance i cant have volume control and noise cancel on ear together i would never have bought them.  dont get me wrong if you like noise cancel on all time or off all time youll be fine but its a deal breaker for me.



Looks like ill stick with a new wh1000m4 if sony make them working on ps4 and 5 otherwise ill try a different brand.  sorry but 250 pounds uk for a top sony headset yet the sony ps4 doesn&#39;t allow them to work wireless is a joke.

Airpods can&#39;t relate bro
The major issue I have with this is that max noise canceling creates a lot of rasp when you walk in the wind. So you must change the setting for when you walk. This leads to a lot of interruptions in your songs (often unfortunately with the worst timing) since you&#39;re always going from one place to another (standing, walking, taking the elevator, walking, taking the escalator, sitting etc.) It&#39;s annoying but it&#39;s what you have to suffer through if you choose to enable max noise canceling.

Watching this stoned, now I own a pair... fuck

I don't understand anything xdd
165£ John LewisJust order them.Cheers Budy!

Who named it better sony or elon musk

what&#39;s the music name <a href="">6:05</a>?

Hello sir, would there be any connection issues or sound quality issues when these earbuds are connected to a low end smartphone like Vivo or Oppo which cost less than the price of these earbuds?

I have them, they are perfect....Sond is 10/10...awsome bass...Battery is long lastingHighly recommend!!BUY IF U CAN!!!

Noise cancelling works okay, but at the risk of quality, the quality is not there, the sound is all over the place, a 10 dollar sony wired sounds better,   im I missing something,  trust me its real premium I really wanted it to be better

I&#39;m looking to hear how the noise cancelling woks....at night I don&#39;t want to hear a peep! Pls. let me know. Thanks!

you know whats annoying? when you drop 260 on earphones and they are absolute garbage. thanx for nothing lew

Is there any difference between the headphone w1000xm3 and this?

These don&#39;t work as well if your hard of hearing and need to wear hearing aids. I basically can&#39;t use these if I wanted to.

I have these for a year now and I just love them! It looks low profile and doesnt look weird on your head. Noise cancelling works like a charm especially when working in the office (but wfh rn). Ambient sound and ANC options are really useful when commuting. Firmware update is also magical! I bought it the time there was no volume control before. But after a firmware it now has an option for volume control ♥️Since I wear eye glasses all the time, using these is more typical than using over-ear/on-ear headphones :)I use it everyday and after a year, it still works and looks like brand new 😯

Can&#39;t afford to buy a pair of these because it&#39;s way too expensive for me.

Just bought these yeah 10/10 headphones better than beats and airpods tbh I only thought those two brands where good but aye this is worth every penny fr imma sony man now 😂

Can you do skull candy Indy evo

Le me skipping almost all the thing.. cause im just considered about the sound quality 😂😅

“I-I.. can hear you... but you’re dead...!”
Would this be good for workouts?

anyone know name the song here at <a href="">6:03</a> ?

<a href="">7:08</a> that smile haunts me to this dayPlease send help

for anyone wondering how they hold up in the water. I Bought these and dropped the right bud into a canal after 2 days... yea, they were on the bottom for about 3 hours before a friend with a BFM (big fucking magnet) came along to fish them out. happy to report they continued to function right after they came out of the water covered in silt and mud still going strong. love them

I swear to god my man just pulled up YouTube music....

Great review, but what watch is that??

<a href="">7:08</a> that is the face I came back to see, that is what we want

Sony wf  1000mx3 or jabra elite 75t ?
I came here for the review, but I stayed for the comments.

I have had this for over 7 months and i still cant remember the name

I&#39;m wanting something like these for mowing, I spend 6hrs a day on a zero turn mower. I&#39;m wondering how good the noise canceling is, and how good they sound.

Should I go for this one September 2020? Or are there better players on the market? Current price in my country is €179.

I tried two pairs. The bluetooth disconnects on iPhone (tried two different phones) very often when a call comes in. And people keep telling me that the line is bad and they can&#39;t hear me correctly when I use htem. They have a good sound quality, good battery, etc. Just DON&#39;T buy these expecting to make phone calls with them. They are terrible for it. Terrible. Even though I`m a Sony fanboy I wish someone had told me that before I plunked down hundreds of dollars to get them, I would have bought something else.

this is perfect airbuds👌

I work in a welding shop it can be loud but I also need to talk to people would these work.

Just watched this review from the UK and instantly purchased them!! Fingers crossed they don&#39;t disappoint 🤞💪

<a href="">7:28</a> is the reason I bought these earbuds

<a href="">5:15</a> He sounds like jacks mum
I heared from these buds but my blitzwolf x7 are more louder and basyer

Sony: Airpods sound too catchy and simple. We need something different.Marketing manager: Uhhhh...SonyWF-1000XM3?Sony: You have a gift, my friend.

How is the bass in these??? Do they have an option for xtra bass?

Lew: &quot;Sony is selling the only point-n-shoot camera you should be interested in...&quot;Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 and FZ2500: &quot;Bruh...&quot;

I&#39;m surprised that there aren&#39;t very many people using you tube music

Which one is better sony wf sp800n or sony wf 1000xm3 or airpod pro or samsung bud live or samsung bud plus need suggestion which one choice is good

good

Better switch off the equalizer

Do a video of wearing best noise cancelling over ears while wearing the best noise cancelling earbuds simultaneously!

Just bought these today for $180 plus tax. I like em a lot so far, I’m coming from my wired iPhone earphones

I love the &quot;im having a good time&quot;

Does the case charge with a wireless pad?

<a href="">6:55</a> wtf why does his left hand looks so fucking big

<a href="">7:07</a>

Sony

How are these with invasive bass? I have the mx3&#39;s and they do wonders for muting my neighbor&#39;s amc speaker set up. I had to switch off my Arctis Steel Pros because I could still feel that shit. When I work out tho, Im currently using galaxy pods plus and obvi those don&#39;t have cancelation.

Transport? So i am riding on my bike and i will never hear horns behind! LOL

Ok but with the auto pause when you take one out, can you turn that off? I lm allowed to only have one earbud in while I’m at work. So if it’s just gonna pause when I only have one in, I can’t buy em.

I&#39;ve gone back to my Apple EarPods as I&#39;m integrated into the Apple eco system and it just works

This review made me Buy the Sony Wf 1000xm3

This works with all devices right? Like i dont need a sony device, these are compatible with a samsung s20plus right?

Why INDIANS get everything at higher price?If i convert foreign pricing to indian pricing they are priced at $178=₹13324/- and in INDIA they are priced at ₹17999/- .Again disappointed 💔💔

I plan on purchasing these at Best Buy during there anniversary weekend sale!

I hate the fake thinking face

Apple: airpodsSamsung: galaxy budsSony: eminem rap

It seems like music gives u more pleasure then Sex 😂🤣

anyone got experienced?  my left earbud suddenly while I&#39;m listening to music notify  battery low  turn off . yhrn it died it won&#39;t charge and it wont turn on. does this have a  world wide warranty? i just have this for only 8 days

<a href="">7:10</a> Hilarious 😂
how about gaming... any sound delay?

These are now less than 200 after tax at BestBuy if anyone is trying to snag a pair.

Any news about the 4’s?

I&#39;m looking for a pair of earbuds that are ipx7, with ambient sound pass through, all listening and volume options covered  and mono listening capabilities. I&#39;m not looking to spend an arm and a leg but any help would be greatly appreciated.

What&#39;s the phone he&#39;s using in this video?

<a href="">7:09</a> this whole segment is a meme😂😂

I watch this channel especially when I have anxiety. Something about this format calms me down. Also I could never afford this stuff but one can dream!

I&#39;ve just ordered these to pair up with my Wh-1000XM3s. I&#39;ll use the over ears whilst commuting and the need for stronger noise cancelling is needed, and the in ears for exercising, walking etc.

Where I can buy it through online?

GET THE ALL-NEW 2020 APPLE AIRPODS PRO FOR UP TO 61% OFF NOW!!! CLICK THE LINK BELOW...
How much did they pay you... These things are horrible. I am trying to wear them when I am cleaning my house and every 30sec it&#39;s automatically changing its settings, pausing what I am listening to then bing starts playing sounding completely different, 30sec later it does it again. Took then back to the store and learned that they had gotten 10 in sold all 10, and 5 have come back. So frustrating.

if you don&#39;t come to this guy before you buy something you&#39;re doing it wrong!

This definitely sounds better than the Airpods Pro. It&#39;s a huge difference in sound department even while keeping the noise cancellation off, and then turn that noise cancellation feature on and the difference becomes unimaginable. I can say this because I own both.

Am Sry but absolutely waste of money. I just got a pair today. I use AirPods Pro regularly. When you compare, these don’t come anything close to the Pro. Also, its not optimised for Siri. I wish I could return. Can’t do it in India hence will get rid of them in other ways. If you are looking for NC, please don’t pick these.

I envy people with regular sized ears. I wore these at work for a day. They cause pain &amp; just fall out. I could never wear earphones. My ears are just too small, &amp; they produce a shit ton of earwax. I have to clean out my ears everyday, otherwise I get swimmers ear in the shower, or if I swim. It&#39;s just a joke played by genes to get me to spend more $ on custom shit. Anyway headphones rule, but the sweat in the heat is just bad for your ears &amp; your headphones lifespan...

1 year anniversary

@unbox therapy Hi, I like your reviews,, I wondering if these pods are good for bikers?,, considering that that biker will wear them inside the helmet and will not be able to touch them as regular users pl advice as I&#39;m more to into it rather than the bikeres headset like SENA because they are not giving same Bass Quality

You deserve your 17 million followers 💫
No volume control? Lame, I suppose you can ask the assistant to turn it up.

I have the pros and the wf-1000xm3. while the pros can stay in your ears better, I find the Sony willl give u better sound quality

You know if these will attach to a PS4?

What happens when you lose one?

Sony price in india to much cost

They completely fell apart (glue turned to complete liquid) in 5 months. No water damage, no heat exposure. Just fell apart one day out of the blue, oozing liquid where I assume glue is meant to be.

just got these today and they are extremely high quality

Would like to see video on caps you wear

Very good video I gonna get them today can’t wait !   Screw the system in my car !!!

Are they supposed to blink blue with 5 second intervals when connected all the time? I feel like they shouldn’t blink once connected.

Sony is killing the competition in headphones department. Not only with these, but also with overear WH-1000 XM3. After all, they have the knowledge and experience, they are true premium brand, which people often forget.

Can these automatically connect like the galaxy buds do when you open up the case and take it out with a s10

Gimme shelter is the song to go when you do these videos! Like from me)

Is it water proof?

The seal the foam tips create should create better isolation and crisper sound

Finally, I bought this sony earphone.Noise canceling system is so great and totally different from other gidgets. Definitlly try it.

I bought these today.

watching this with earbuds that only play through one side

I just ordered mine!

<a href="">7:08</a> convinced me that this is the best option out there

the darker ear tips are for swimming or submersion.

This still won&#39;t connect to Windows 10... No updates from Sony. Turned out to be useless stuff.

How long will the rechargeable battery last before you have to chuck them down the landfill or ocean to be swallowed by a turtle or a fish?

So once you have people around you in public talking. The volume automatically turns down?

Yeah, they changed the game- fastest falling out of the ears true wireless earbuds ever! Beware of walking with it 😁

The noise canceling didn&#39;t work for me.  Or I just didn&#39;t know how to use it? Help?

This guy is providing the worst reviews arround. Especially if you see him reviewing blackpods and saying they are unique, but actually they are sh*t as hell. Do not trust this guy, and consider unsubscribe from his channel!

If I made products I would pay this dude so much money to test my products. He can sell just about anything. Bout to go out and buy these headphones

The Sony earbuds are the best. No more no less. That&#39;s it.

My work has an exclusive deal with Sony so I got a big discount on these bad boys.Loving them. Blows the airpods out of the water and every pair of earbuds I&#39;ve ever used

Worst Headphones I have ever used. Wish I would have chosen the Bose or JBL ones

&quot;these comply tips are sooo squishy&quot; doesn&#39;t know how comply tips work

WARNING: Buyer Beware; NONE of these products endorse or make a statement in their literature or box components that they ARE compatible with Windows 10.



June 2020 Windows put out version 2004 of Windows 10, further NONE of these buds worked prior to the June release and with Windows 10, unlike Windows 7, you can NOT decide which updates to choose, only delay the update in time over a short period.



NONE of these work with Windows 10 Bluetooth; massive issues!!!!



These fly by night reviewers NEVER talk about that issue!!! Phone connectivity, great, PC, pathetic!!!

has anyone tried cycling with these? (amateur cycling*)

Everything is awesome but, not sweat proof is a major letdown 😓

i&#39;m just mad i can&#39;t afford any of this shit.

Don’t forget to allow 4 break in period? Nice 🇨🇦 hat.

Im over here listening to this with one ear bud on since i just threw the other one inside the toilet thinking it was dog poo since i took a fat rip out the rig i was trippin balls

Great music audio quality... unfortunately echo sounds effects during calls😂😂 Replaced with Bose with in a day....

Not being able to adjust volume from the earbuds themselves is a dealbreaker for me.

<a href="">7:29</a> you sounded like Phil Dunphy for a little while there lol

Is it waterproof??????????

This looks like our generation of  what Cybermen would use to scramble our minds and change us to one of them

I just subscribed your channel. Can you please review LENOVO HT10 TWS. Love from INDIA.

you know Lew likes the headset&#39;s sound when the eyes go sharp and the lips go (0)             `&#39;o

Do these go well with iphone? Or if you got an iphone is it better to go for airpods? Considering connectivity and sound quality.I only wonder if apple cuts some qualities  of these other brand just cuz they feel hurt you dis not buy another apple product 😂

Sony don&#39;t understand quality of  sound . They just advertise and shows other brand down . Bose , sennizer, Jabra, air pod,are best . Sony gud in led tv only rest up to you.

There is clicking noise when I connect these buds to my laptop, not sure what happened. I asked Sony, and their reply was that it&#39;s probably not compatible to my HP Spectre Windows 10. There is an occasional static or clicking noise on phones as well.

Anyone use these under their motorcycle helmet?  Good for wind noise?

I don’t know why, but he reminds me of Quentin Tarantino

<a href="">7:09</a> that smile xD

Can you use left or right without the other to talk on ?

Sony: We need a good name for our new earbuds...Elon Musk: Here ya&#39; go :)

Do this work on ps4 ??

In $200 you can get really nice, feature rich branded smartphone along with wire headphones. And wireless earbud cost $230 is not expensive. 🤨🤔

That tight shot that comes in from the side looks so funny

Your sound is going in and out. Why not use sound booth.

What is the IP rating on these?

We&#39;re considering these or the Apple ones, but I&#39;ve seen nothing to say they can connect to a computer.  Are they for mobiles only?  I&#39;ve also read that these Sony earbuds can either have Siri or Google Assistant- so does that mean they work with an iPhone or iPad too?

Bro someone leaked the new sony phoneThe sony hbsusbauhanugabygbsu sub x100000000000000000000000000

Doood bruh, just need to know what the music wuz!

The only I wish these had is a smaller design, but also what the AirPod Pros have, which is vents in the ear and outside for equal pressure.

Daddy helped me buy some earphones

Like my comment if you think Sony makes sexy products

I bought the Sony wf1000xm3&#39;s based on this review and other reviews like it...the sound on these earphones are amazing, I&#39;m not gonna lie...but the rest is horrible...bluetooth disconnects all the time...left ear goes softer...balance between left and right is slightly biased to the right...switching between noise cancelling modes only works when it wants to...returned them after 10 days of ownership...I thought Sony had answered my prayers with these, but alas, it was not to be...these earphones are way too expensive for me to be experiencing such issues...oh, and to top it off, Sony doesn&#39;t cover any warranty on these earphones...you have to take it up with the store you bought them from...

Damn just bought the over ear version. Now I want these.

The look to these just look outdated lol

Are they waterproof?

i dont like them.i have 14 euro earphones that sounds better.

Can u adjust the volume from the earbuds????

Just managed to bag a pair of these for a great deal at £70, can&#39;t wait to try them!

After almost one year of having these M3 earbuds I can absolutely say I love them. They were worth every cent I paid for them. SONY nailed this pair of wireless earbuds Imho :)

I just buy right now wf-1000xm3,trust me this earbuds is number one best in the world...love100000000000

Are these compatible with mac? Can I use them for videocalls?

So I&#39;m watching the review on the WH-1000XM3, the over ear ones so I can&#39;t really compare them between each other, I do, however, have the Galaxy buds and I&#39;m really thinking about buying the in-ear 1000XM3s... Should I buy them? Someone please answer lol

Carry case too big

I love  Sony, but I buy just Sennheiser In ear MomentumTW 2 is that wrong, oh yea SONY sorry I still love you. Marcel from Holland,please give your advice

Bought these and they worked fine for 4 months and then the left earbud didn’t work anymore, the NC didn’t do it anymore. Send them back and waited for 3 weeks, Sony just reset them to factory settings, still didn’t work when I picked them up in the shop and now have to wait another 3 weeks and perhaps they would give new ones! Most crap service ever got. Second pair of Sony’s that break down in like 2 months. No Sony anymore, the quality doesn’t seem to be there for the price you pay or it is bad luck (twice?) better buy Apple AirPods Pro.

What phone is that?

No reviewer talked about the auto ambient turn on feature during making call and u can&#39;t even turn it off and u hear all outside noice and don&#39;t hear the caller well. Very very very bad feature. Why no one talked about it.

Solo bud use?
Why the flying FUCK does this headphone make a bell noise every time it switches adaptive sound profile? And you can&#39;t turn this off? Am I the only one taking crazy pills here?

apple=expensive phonesony=literally all tech segment is expensive

Unbox Therapy: Barely shakes head to keep earbud inFlossy Carter: Earthquake simulater

how do people keep these things in their ears?  i think it&#39;s just my ears.  any tips?

I think it easily beats the airpods.. BUT I am still looking for a 10+ hr battery life

still not available in India

🤔 another “another game changer” 😂😂😂 everything is a “game changer here 😂

Thank you for yourreview.I bought Sony. This is the best of other ones.

This video was so useful and informative. Answered all my questions. Thank you.

Far far better than any other pod

At first glance- one deal breaker for me is case size.  If I can’t slip them comfortably into a small pocket I just wouldn’t keep them with me.  I think this is one area the Apple wins

My biggest gripe is the fact that it’s not compatible with ps4.

someone knows if it works in PLAYSTATION?

What brand cellphone do you have?

How can I connect these to my ZV-1 as mics and headphones??????

Totally unbiased 😂😂

Would not recommend these earphones if you care about calls. There is a bug where ambient sound control turns on when you make calls and it introduces more static noise during calls making it harder to understand who you talk to. If you are planning make calls with this in a noisy environment, good luck hearing. I’ve looked for solutions and have updated the earphones, cant find any. Dont think sony cares to fix it either as some threads have been months old and no solutions. Exchanging mine.

Tip: you can use the case as a phone stand

Hi buddy I’m from Indian    Which headset best one Air pods pro an Sony wf 1000xm3

Does it good for iphone users ?

These are without doubt the most comfortable ear buds and I have tried many of them, sound is awesome!

Heads up, They are way too quite for my Huawei phone.  I had to return them.

I can hear youBut your dead🤣🤣
Is this sweat proof? Can I use it for workout/jogging?

S for SONY that is why S for sound.

You didn&#39;t test the mic!!

What is the app?? And Will it work on android?

is there knows the music background at <a href="">7:14</a>?

can you test Skullcandy crusher wireless? I know they&#39;re not the best ones, nor the quality sound, but people says they are really fun to use..... maybe? I want to see your reaction to those, and they are affordable btw

These are still on top to this day. The sound performance is just way too good. They are actually closer to the M3 over the ears than they should be for something this small. Sony has a Master Magician.

wathing this with my eyes and my wh1000xm3

I bought it two month ago, It’s SHIT, waste of money, The noise canceling doesn’t work in a way you can use it especially in the high ways where I’m commuting to work everyday. They also don’t firm in your ears , if you wanna go to gym with them, you’re go be disappointed even if you change the Ear pads   .All in all I wasted my money,I don’t know how the other brands are working but this one is definitely crap

I have both... and can tell you the noise canceling is a wink better on the Sony’s but sound definitely better on the AirPods

what&#39;s the call quality like ? The mic?

There are hundreds of positive reviews on YouTube calling it best noise cancelling ear buds Agreed! What about micro phones? These have the worst micro phones and no one is talking about that? Isn&#39;t that important ? I mean these are considerably expensive shouldn&#39;t these have decent if not perfect micro phones?

I know this is an old video but I bought the Sony overhead version after his review. Now I need something more portable I was tied between the Jabra 75t Elite Or these. Sony you son of  bitch, you&#39;ve done it again.

This video got me hyped!

The noise cancellation does work well. Apparently my wife asked me to wash the dishes. Never heard a thing darling 🤷🏻‍♂️

Need to know if I can connect My iPhone and my Windows Laptop simultaneously with this one? (or any other if you can suggest to me) I am on calls all the time, either on phone or on pc don&#39;t really like switching earphones or wearing 2 for that matter.

i guess 3k dislike is from airpod fans ?

Lew: &quot;These are headphones!!&quot;

The tips look prty <b>tip</b>-ical

Huge size of the charging case. I have Android, I dislike Apple, but bought AirPods pro because of the case and because that it doesn&#39;t go into the ear and the transparency mode is natural

Bought them and what a dissapointment they are. For that money, the Airpods Pro would have been a much better buy. after a couple of months, the  sound of the left one dimmed...why?no idea...still trying to fix it. Sony, this is crap.!

Can I sweat in these????

do a vid on the new ones

Are these worth ?

Name.. um, Jabra, I&#39;m new here, but my dad&#39;s been here before..,Nah, bruh you ain&#39;t on the list, go home..k.

I&#39;ve had this set of earpieces for 5 months now... They are the best investment EVER!!! Everytime I listen to Spotify it feels like I have a good quality soundbar in my ear lol.

I&#39;ve been looking for the best under 100 and its ridiculously difficult to decipher

The first song that started playing had the beat for &quot;I need a gangsta b**ch&quot; lol

I got a good deal on these and its the first-ever ANC headset/earbuds I&#39;ve ever tried. Its mind-blowing and i don&#39;t want to take them off xD

Just got these last week. I’ve wanted a pair ever since I seen this video. My first pair of expensive headphones, I must say I’m in love with them. The sound quality it amazing, the fit is fine with the ones one it, I haven’t got to even try the extra sets of tips, I’m going to mess around with those tomorrow.I work in a loud environment, lots of condenser fans and coolers running, radio on, tv on, other equipment all making humming and other sounds. I don’t always use the noise cancelling when working. It is a really nice feature and seems to block out tons of the noise around me. Battery life is awesome. I highly recommend them. 10/10z

The microphone looks like a headphone jack

Honest to god, this is biggest sham active noise cancelling I&#39;ve ever come across.I tested 2 units with the app. It&#39;s easy to say that they noise cancel between the ambient 20 setting to noise cancelling on setting. But if you&#39;re really honest, between putting the earbuds on and off with noise cancelling fully on, it doesn&#39;t do a bloody thing. It&#39;s actually amplifying the sound when it&#39;s using the ambient modes. I cannot comprehend anyone didn&#39;t check that. and they&#39;re fit in and here is terrible compared to other units I&#39;ve used, in particular the Jabra 65t and 75t. I wish Jabra made an active noise cancelling earbuds. I actually think that would be much better than these absolutely appalling earbuds that&#39;s only want to say are active noise cancelling. They might technically do that but they actually don&#39;t work in the field. I&#39;ve got no idea how you review is actually think this works.

Hello, I got these as a present some time ago and I really want to use them since they were expensive and I don’t have earbuds but I just can’t fit them in my ear I don’t know if it’s just my ear or if I put it wrong in? What do I do:(

I just bought them and the app is not available in the apple App Store.

Hi professor, please can make a video for the Sony WF-SP800N, with all the information and maybe vs some products

Me listening with the AirPod Pros rn-“Oh shit, why didn’t I get these instead?”Also me-“Remembers that the AirPods Pro have transparency and has a more comfortable fit and as a package the best wireless ear buds on the market.”

Bro music is mixed by professionals who eq it with world class monitors and treated rooms to ensure the perfect sound.  Leave the equalizers alone lol

I wan to know what noise does it cancel to the when you on a phone callExample does it filter unwanted noise

Watching the review on these exact earbuds lol.. love them! Everything is good about them.. call quality is really good too

These better then Bose sound sport???

An in ear pod cannot compete with an over ear like the dr Dre beats but I one that comes close.

Sounds like shit 177 euro fine don&#39;t bay them

Hi sir. Is it also good for phone calls? Or only just for listening?

Does anyone know if they’re waterproof

I had these... The sound quality was amazing and the noise cancelation worked pretty well but they wouldn&#39;t stay in my ears, they consistently kept falling out no matter what size tip I put on. They&#39;re too heavy ... Had to return them.

Why cant I just use the left ear bud it wont connect to my s9 when it&#39;s just the left one out of the charging case

Just two questions. How many decibels  does it reduce and what if you use it in the world&#39;s silentest room?

has anyone tried these for gaming ? a little advice here would nice !

Did you really need 9 and a half minutes to tell me nothing about the soundstage, frequency response &amp; quality of sound in bass/mid/treble range, and literally anything else of real use?

Is it water resistant?

I can’t believe’ I bought the Powerbeats pro and these Sony earbuds are waaaaaaaaasy better! I will be exchanging them Monday 😖😖😖😖😖😖

I really thought I could stick a Duracell battery in my ear after Watching this

Nothing but funny clowns in the comment section.

damn it 4 months ago i bought airpods

Do these youtube folks get paid by the companies?

By the way you cannot connect these to two devices at one time.

How much will they drop in price by when the XM4s come out?

My jabras do the job just fine

I bought myself the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless headphones and I am very disappointed with them. They fall out of my ears. I tried the different size fittings, but still no good. Earlier I was washing a dish in the kitchen sink and the sony headphone fell off my ear and in to the sink!!!  🤢🤮

Do you actually think that putting high frequency receivers in side your actual head(ears) for extended periods of time is an ok idea???The epa test things like this, for safety for 90 days...Do you know anyone who got cancer from smoking for 90 days? NO! Hope ya all see my point..There generally is collateral damage when convenience is in the equation. THINK FOR YOURSELVES.STOP BEING ON AUTOPILOT!!!

Help!  Looking for wireless earbuds with a waterproof charge case.  I just washed my 1More’s and I know I should have thrown the case into a bowl of uncooked rice to extract the water BUT they were working fine after I pulled them out of the washer so I just figured that water didn’t get in there.  Yeah.  The case won’t charge them anymore.  So if anyone knows of a waterproof charge case that I don’t have to buy separately from the actual unit please share.  Thanks.

Sony: why is everyone giving us a hard time about the earbudsAlso Sony: <b>WTF-1390jefjkfkjlfewfbwjb</b>

For the first time he actually likes something he reviews

I have the WH-1000XM3 headphones and i don&#39;t want to compromise with an earbud.  I bought Jabra Elite 65t for working out....but they sound very empty and I hate it.  What do / would you wear when working out?  These seem like a damn good contender especially given how great the the WH headphones are; especially with LDAC enabled.i&#39;m not worried about sweat getting into them.  My ears don&#39;t sweat a lot when working out unless i&#39;m wearing my WHs.I want to get new earbuds.  I haven&#39;t even had the Jabra&#39;s for two weeks.  I just need to convince my wife :|Thanks in advanceSide note: you want an experience - check out Acai Tower by capshun with the WH headphones.  Blew me away.

Sony design always the best 😍

Sony really makes the best headphones.

Are these better than AirPods pro

I absolutely love these earbuds! This video was honestly my deciding factor. By far the best bass I&#39;ve personally ever heard from earbuds.

Will these work with Siri commands?

Im going to buy these asap

i have the WF-1000X and i wish i had these. the ones i have have got some of the same features and has a led on each bud to indicate they are on. wish you could use both idependatly though. the app is good though. does anyone know why the 1000X beep normally?

Im gonna get some soon, they went down to about 100-190

The charging case and buds look too large for your pocket and ears... Sony needs to make them 25% smaller &amp; I’m sold.

Ps4 supported???
what is the name of background music at <a href="">2:15</a>?, thanks.

Did I just watch this the 2nd time after 8 months!? Yes... why? Sony’s now on discount. Bet you a new one’s coming soon!

I have them and they suck ass uncomfortable ugly and hurt your ears after 5 mins of use

Almost got hit by a train10/10

Hate to insert silicone in my ear canal. I will keep using both AirPods 1 &amp; 2

Lou, what is the best wireless earbuds, that you&#39;ve tried thus far?

I can;t make up my mind. I&#39;ve been hanging on this decision for weeks now, jabra 75t or sony wf1000? i like jabra cause they are smaller and they are also a bit cheaper but those sony......damn

Hi, I have the over ear headphones which are amazing, but i am wanting some in ear ones too for hot days and exercise. I have seen these don&#39;t have a water resistant rating, but I have also seen people saying its a bit of a none issue, and that they fit perfectly etc. Just wondering if anyone on here has used them for gym stuff and can give some insight? Do they fit well and still work after sweating etc?Cheers.

Apple airpods are just over rated !! They need to calm down

When i heard the price i stopped this video

So am I the only one who prefers headphones to ear buds?🤔

Am I the only person that these ear buds where way too big to fit in my ears, that they kept falling out,even with the slightest movement.?

Review seemed bias. No offense

&quot;230$&quot; Sikeeee never again

Lmfao I know you help companies find new customers all the time cause I&#39;ve bought off of your recommendations a few times.

Does the noise cancelation stay on if you use it for sleep w/o song?

Can u use these on iOS?

$230.00 hell no

Apple: AirPods.      Galaxy: galaxy buds.        <b>sony: the friendly sign language rappers do in music videos</b>

How much do they hang out of ear? Can I put my helmet on with these in my ears?

Wich phone is that..??

Just bought a set of these. Sound fantastic. But I’m having terrible problems with reliability. Audio glitches, drop-outs, total loss of connection to phone. I’ve been in touch with Sony support, who have been quick to respond but of little help. Requested a refund. First set of Bluetooth headphones I reluctantly bought. Think I’ll go back to wired. Really I just want to put my cans on &amp; listen to my music in really good quality. I can’t do that with these. Too much tech. These are for gadget nerds, not music lovers.

You tweek, you toggle......

Did you test the mic for phone calls?

Can these work for pc gaming?

Great video. Keep up the good work.

Are they  water proof?

JACK! 😆🤣😂
Can not watch that because of ADs 👎🏻

I have these &amp; they’re GREAT.  I wish they were waterproof too. Not a complaint just a suggestion for the next one. 😉😊

Mine keeps blinking  blue lights even when I have enough charged. How can I fix this??

They look kinda bulky😕

Killings performance  that&#39;s name SONY ..make . Believe

Support my channel by subscribing , I&#39;m a new youtuber

Wtf was the point of this video😅

these are shit because they just dont stay in my ears and keep falling. So I just cant listen to music with them. Sucks!

Sony needs to get its head out of the 90’s when naming its products. I’ve always found it a ball ache figuring out which product is which...

I love my Sony mdr 80... And my skull crushers.... I&#39;m a massive bass head

Hi, does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to share these with friends? Listen to music together with one each, etc.

bluetooth pairing with these things is a total nightmare. I totally regret buying those things as in half cases I do not use them because of super bad and almost never working bluetooth pairing.

Dear Sony this is not a name of earbud but sentence!!

Definitely the best..i just purchase them..(WOW)Top Notch you get what you pay for👍

Superb Sony earbuds

Those drums though whenever he tests a product that&#39;s really really good.

I don&#39;t usually watch these kind of vids, but seriously this isn&#39;t a review. You&#39;re promoting.

When you go out in a date but turns out  your date was a trap  <b><a href="">7:15</a></b>

is it still the best available in the market?

These are your more tip-ical tips.They fit better... for fit-ness.They are literally perfect head-phones.You put them on your head and listen to your phone.

They didn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s ear shape into count at all in this they just assumed it would fit for everyone I spent my money to have good headphones and the smallest silicone tip still won&#39;t fit in my ear what so ever I&#39;m extremely dissapointed and wish someone said something

CEO of Sony: “We need a name for our newest product”Head of naming things at Sony: Throws wireless keyboard down the stairsCEO of Sony: “It’s perfect”

I bought these a week ago and the sound quality is fantastic. Being able to adjust the sound in the app is a great perk. However, I just took them back. They cut in and out on occasions. And while the bass is heavy like I like the earbuds were not comfortable and fell out sometimes. I thought sound quality was the most important factor but comfort is right up there with it. Also they took awhile to connect to my iphone. I bought airpods pro the same day I took these back and I&#39;m so happy I made that choice. The compatibility with my iphone is amazing. and the noise cancelation and transparency modes are better on my airpods.

🔥🔥🔥  <a href="">1:33</a> 🔥💃🧡   👇👇👇👇
whoever reading this, trust me, this is the best wireless in-ear buds u will ever get

Where are my apple people at? ————————&gt;

<b>So the question is, do I buy these or the AirPods pro</b>Jesus is a bass head and needs to be impressed

Sorry to say  !Very ugly design

I wonder if it pairs with ps4

Sony is killing Bose, just like it&#39;s killing the traditional camera makers. Just heard that Bose&#39;s CEO was removed. Sony is on the warpath in terms of  innovation and destroying its competitors.

Ok

the foam sold me, i hate putting rubber buds in my ears

I have these, they suck. They are only good for smartphone audio, microphone is terrible and connectivity sucks for PC.

I&#39;m watching this video on these buds. Tan version. Its badass. If you want some solid &quot;on-the-go&quot; type earbuds with solid quality. Good sound and lots of features? These are the ones. Yes. Its kind expensive. But for some one the go? DOPE. ASF. Very premium feel through and fuckin through.

I just bought these today and they are amazing at noise canceling 💯💯 will test the rest later 💯

If I got this people will think its bad and airpods are better because everyone doesnt know anything and technology

I talk on the phone as LITTLE a possible, its all about the music for me and these Sony&#39;s are great.  It&#39;s hard to get good bass out or earbuds but Sony nails it with the WF-1000XM3. Thanks for the review.

Should buy sonys actions

Sony:  So what should we name our newest product?Some guy: Check the back of the router

One thing I don&#39;t like about mine, once you set the ANC where you want it, it reverts back to no ANC after you shut it off.  Why can&#39;t they design it such that it stays at your setting until you change it?

Please test for us the &quot;Xperia 1 mark 2&quot;

if the assistant pronounces the name of this headphones every time you&#39;re connected—good luck with the battery life

I&#39;d like an update. I want them compared to the Airpods Pro. I&#39;m an Apple user and I&#39;m getting fed up with the &quot;new improvements&quot; whereas Androids are ahead of the game and are doing things well. I like a little more customization than Apple allows though I don&#39;t go crazy. I&#39;m looking in an Android phone, good headphones (I have AirPods 2) and also a good music app that allows me to load my personally owned music. So far android music apps haven&#39;t been my favorite. Recommendations?

The call quality is so bad !! I had to return them to the store.

These are probably 10x better than AirPods yet Apple will dominate the market in sound products lol.  I don’t consider Apple AirPods or any sound products quality though.  I’ve done tests with 40$ earbuds and they last longer and sound better than AirPods.  Wait until apples 400$ headphones come out.  There will be 100$ headphones that sound better and last longer as well.  Apple is all about fashion and convenience.  That’s why I never buy Apple products never have never will. Only retards buy Apple accessories like headphones, earbuds and so on.  People are even more special for buying Apple computers and monitors.  Apple got people on standby with runny noses.  Because sheeple are suckers.

Sony experience!
That guy is uncomfortable to listen to... like he kind of has no clue about tech. Or maybe he is aiming at dumb people and dumbs down himself for them? In any case he&#39;s creepy.

Im an apple user, wondering if I can charge these with the power brick from Apple, or if I can charge them at all without having to buy a separate charger? The newest Apple device I have is the iPhone XR .

Hi, i wanna ask, does your right earbud drain battery more? i just bought the WF-1000XM3 and having problem the right earbud drains battery more..

Have you managed to connect to an iPad?  For me, it remains elusive and as such not a viable option. If they only work on my phone they are useless.

the amount of makeup on this guy!

I need something I can sleep with.

Can someone please tell me if they are comfortable for all day use as I have heard about the airpods?

<a href="">7:17</a> You need to floss your teeth bro

It&#39;s funny and amazing how Sony gives 0 fuck about how confusing and weird their naming convention is. It&#39;s like they believe this is how future humans would name things.

I’m just waiting for Sony to have a new wireless earphones that their cases is small and sleek

Just got em.. best headphones I&#39;ve used so far

Spr

Are these compatible with bluetooth 4.2? Thank you

If someone has bought these please let us know how does it sound and how does it compare to other wireless/wired earphones.

Phone calls????
EXCELLENT THANKS BIG BRO

Bro what is the price 🙂

Bought these.  Misses 3 of my busses and waited at the bus stop for about an hour getting pissed because my bus wasn&#39;t coming according to the bus app. These are good

So I have two options, either the Sony or the Powerbeats which have both been reviewed on this page. However, nothing as a side by side comparison.. I already own a set of over ear Bose noise cancelling for airplanes or to zone out at home, but if I were to buy one of these it would be to commute/ go to the gym, and I sweat a lot- would Sony be able to handle sweat?

He’s ok with the huge bulky case plus the large size of the buds. Unbelievable. If it was an Apple product the media would trash and bash them.

do these vs airpods pro

But I hear its not sweat proof..

<a href="">1:45</a> this shit

What phone are u using in this video

Jabra 75t on YouTube is pretty freakin’ sweet as well.

I could. See my self losing those tips

Why doesn&#39;t he just have these people off-camera on the video if he&#39;s going to talk to them the whole time?

What is the name of the phone shown in the video?

Any idea if these are more comfortable than the Jabra 65T as they hurt my ears

Can this connect to iPhone

guys would y recommed jbl tune 220 tws?

Garbage

Something I see that nobody talks about is that the case also acts as a phone stand when deployed open on its lid. The little curved lip acts as a catch prevent the phone from sliding down. It’s kinda cool

What song is playing when your listening to the earbuds?

Does it also have like the transparent mode of airpods pro?

&quot;These are your more rubberized soft touch feel&quot; how can this guy spend his entire professional life reviewing tech and not know those are silicone ear tips.

Can i use active noise canceling without music or any playing tracks

I never thought you would join the corporate shills.  You unashamedly started  touting SONY before you even tried the buds.  Just don&#39;t act like you give independent reviews and then so obviously drool all over the product before you even try it.  Thumbs down for this review, just too biased for me to believe it&#39;s genuine.

Are they louder and better sounding than the Apple airpods? I know you said that. They have better options but what about the sound quality and volume?

Which is the best earbuds for Apple ???

lovely product!

These are horrible earbuds. I am amazed why so many people like them. I just got mine yesterday and can&#39;t find one single reason to keep them. For anyone considering these, just make sure you can return them. I had the Jabra 75t earbuds and they blow these out of the water in comfort, sound and fit. Unfortunately, Jabras suffer from connectivity issues. The noise cancelling on these is no more than a gimmick. Sony will tell you to make sure you have a good fit with the tips. That&#39;s a marketing ploy because it&#39;s common sense. They claim the noise cancelling will cancel 70-80% of noise; so will good fitting passive noise cancelling earbuds. These are not worth the price. If you&#39;re deciding between these and something else, save your time...these are terrible.

Sony had good R&amp;D team and worst marketing team working at same office....While all other companies like especially chinese are boasting about the crap  they make......sony working good but not loud enough to make people aware of their products....I am  just  seeing about these in 2020..... Pls consider the name like S-pods r something not like wzm5hhhdbjd-1222ff32....

Do I buy this WF-1000XM3 or Bose QuietComfort 20?

Do I buy this WF-1000XM3 or Bose QuietComfort 20?

There&#39;s a hardcore Sony fan here!

He&#39;s rocking the op7 pro with the dbrand gripSame as me lol

Im sold

I BOUGHT THESE LAST WEEK WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS. THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY NICE and THEY ARE VERY NICE QUALITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE MATERIAL DONT GET ME WRONG , SADLY THEY DID NOT SATISFY ME. THEY FALL OUT FAIRLY EASY IF YOU HAVE A HOODIE ON AND THE RIGHT EARBUD LOST CONNECTION FREQUENTLY, ALSO THE OVERALL DESIGN IS JUST NOT COMFORTABLE. FOR THE PRICE OF 300$ THESE EARBUDS ARE NOT WORTH IT. FOR THOSE REASONS I WENT AND GOT MY MONEY BACK

Yes but if anything goes wrong with my AirPods After 6 months I can walk into an Apple store and have them fixed or replaced straight away. With Sony, you have to send them away. Massive inconvenience.

Should I get these or the WH-1000XM3 headphones

Someone here watching the review using SONY WH 1000XM3?

<a href="">7:10</a> Is that Chris Hemsworth impression?

I got them for 180 bucks!

My only complaint is how far you have to shove them into your ears.

How can I minimize the noise people hear when I&#39;m talking to them? Person on the other line always complains that they can hear everything in the background and not so much my voice

which smartphone are u useing in this video can u tell me please ?

Apple AirPods: *existLiterally Everybody: *are these wireless earbuds the new airpods killers

Do they make head phones that help people with hearing issues?

loved your review, thank you! Very informative. I have seen many others reviews on this model and i was pretty convinced but you basically just nailed it for me..  Well done, thank you!

Does the Sony app with these have the ability to catalog and play music?  I currently use PI Music player.

ok i get it. Take my money.
What about sound quality? You said nothing about that.

Can’t decide Sony’s or AirPod Pro’s? 🤔

Just bought it, updated to latest firmware and really happy. Sounds great, NC works nice, and it stays in my ears just fine. Can&#39;t wait to test it tomorrow in aeroplane..

Just bought some WH 1000MX3 for $229.99. incredible headphones for the money.

What- No Leafs cap, Lou? It&#39;s still hackie season. We&#39;re still watching hackie!

I know this late but are they waterproot

Airpods Pro now have noise cancellation

I&#39;m hearing with my wf 1000xm3

Where usually Sony fails is in implementation. I have the XM3s. It can’t connect to more than 1 device.The google assistant does not work ( cannot hear you), mics are bad, but most importantly: yes,  it detects surroundings , however when switches modes there is a 3 second sound gap ( silence) which is disastrous if watching a movie or most importantly you are in a call.

do they give a cable in the box?

which one&#39;s betterLike: Airpods proComment: Sony WF-1000XM3

basicly i want some earbuds that i can connect to my galaxy watch, listen to music thats stored on my galaxy watch. be nice to be able to leave phone at home and go for a run and still receive phone calls

Are these headphones like the AirPods I mean can you talk with on the phone with each individual piece????

I thought the video was called “The Sony... Just Changed The Name”Wouldnt be the worst thing

Are they going to staying your ear working out

Aight, who else has AirPod pros and is pissed off that Sony made a trash knock-off

Apple: <b>names new earbuds a simple name</b>Sony: what should we name our new earbuds?a random guy: <i>check the back of your router</i>

What phone are you using?

I ❤️ you!
Sony employee: So what should we name our earbuds?Also him: Sits on keyboard

Is the noise cancellation better than the AirPods pro?

Bought them this weekend. Your assessment is spot on. I have the over ear headphones as well and love them too. The earbuds will be my go to since they are more travel friendly.

Price?

<a href="">7:08</a>, is that Dustin&#39;s cousin???

This is the best earbuds that I have ever used except no waterproof. It&#39;s a fact that waterproof cannot make it sound better, but it&#39;s a bonus.

U look kinda drunk at <a href="">7:27</a>
When I was kid a long time ago in a Galaxy far far away I remember my first Walkman I loved it The beastie boys never sounded better Sony has always made a solid product it was the iPod that changed everything four some time, music and how we listen to it  has become a money monster Sony is one product I don&#39;t mind spending the 💰on

Cool idea. Safely Looks kinda ugly though.

I just ordered my pear looking forward to it , I got the Sony extra base headphones now and I love them it&#39;s the wi-sp600n 😍

Watching with airpods on

Wow. If I ever need to advertise a product,I would do my best to hire you, you are selling it. You need to get a job doing commercials. Every time I watch one of your videos, I want to buy what you are previewing. 👍🏼

I just call them sony airpods

I really like them but I don’t think the price should be over 200...don’t know...but I really like them

man you hype every single gadget out there

I love mine!
They look to big

I love them but they do have one flaw: They don&#39;t like cold weather.When I am out and about in like 3°C weather after about 3 hours of using them the noice cancelling starts screaming at me with a high pitched sound that sounds like very heavy interference.They work great on my commute to work but on the weekends, when I am out taking photos during the cold season, they are useless to me.I could just switch off the ANC then but I do not want to risk breaking them with condensation or something like that.To be fair, they seem to be rated for temperatures above 5°C. At least Sony is telling you not to charge them below these temperatures.Also, the DSEE HX is causing connection issues for me. Occasionally I get small cut outs when it&#39;s on. Not that it made a difference for me, anyway.

are they any good for sport ,,,anyone

24k in india

Hey willy du, if you are reading this, listen:Just Do It.

I&#39;m going to buy those cuz In finland those cost 170

Is this earphone better than the airpods pro?

can you please unbox the Amazfit ZenBuds......(*_*) :)

I would love to see companies like Sony develop noise cancelling devices for sleeping.

Why don&#39;t you review the skullcandy sesh Xiaomi airdots and  the jabra 75tI heard that all of them have great quality but which one is the best?

Which cellphone is that?

when you play music on loud. does it get heard by the public?

So does this all work equally for Apple?

Captions?

what phone did lew use in this video?

Sony is THE BEST in the game.

I’m sueing SonyThe noise cancellation is so good I didn’t hear a bus coming. There’s some hot nurses here in hospital tho. 🤤

Call quality is trash

Just bought a pair in the box at goodwill for $13!

I&#39;m starting to think that this channel is an infomercial channel, not a review channel.

You should try out the Raycon E55

Is it dust ,water  resistant

Love your review... TY 💯
Yes they look nice, but its battery life is not as good as they claimed and NO Water resistant 🤔🤔. Naaaaaa I ending switching to a Bose product

I got these - the only problem I have is that I get this lower frequency sounds sometimes. Is that normal or something wrong with them?

So how much did you got from this presentation

Might as well stick 2 dicks in my ears

<a href="">7:12</a> to <a href="">7:24</a> made me laugh ty lew

I bought these things and they&#39;re trash. You can&#39;t even tell when the noise canceling is on. It&#39;s nothing like bose QC or over the ears. Then you have the design. These things will fall out of your ears again and again. Plus they&#39;re just weird. Difficult to hold and handle as you put them in and take them out of the case. Then you have the connectivity issues. The sound will just randomly stop sometimes. The media will keep playing, and your device will still say they&#39;re connected, yet sound is muted. You have to reset the whole bluetooth connection to get the sound to work again. I&#39;ve never had this happen with other buds. The sound will just stop randomly in one ear as well and then come back randomly, and go away, and so forth. The sound quality is also inferior considering the price. Bose soundsport is far better. Finally, these things are extremely uncomfortable. Your earhole will be in pain after an hour. I don&#39;t know how the hell these became the accepted &quot;best&quot; in their class. Must have been a huge marketing scheme because these things are absolute trash.

Watching this video with the same headphones lol They’re great!

I bought Nuheara buds 2 years ago, I got major disappointed from the quality. I hated them in every single way as possible and I felt I got robbed of $400. Since then I&#39;m afraid just to consider buying any hear buds in the market.

Thanks bro getting mine... I wanted u to shake yo head to see if they stay.. thanks

the fit is so bad

Whenever im watching a video or listening to music the sound cuts off for like 15-30 secs? Anyone know why?

Can they connect to the PS4 though

I don&#39;t know if it is just for mine but the volume is weak af, I put it on max volume and most cheap earphones can make the volume sound louder. The quality of the sound is amazing and the noise cancellation works perfectly but god damn it the music volume is just awful (again I don&#39;t know if this is just because mine is not working perfectly or It is like that). I really have bad hearing so I&#39;m disappointed with that.

Any way to switch gesture control off? It blocks sou d when wearing in a helmet.i was able to switch off the touch left right off. But the hand over ear i was not able to switch off.

<a href="">8:48</a>. CUSTOMMMMM.

<a href="">5:27</a> FREQUENCIESSSS.

Very very good earbuds!

I just just bought these today. buyer beware. they won&#39;t fit all ears.  sony also has a no refund policy for in-ear buds due to hygene concerns.  so i now have a pair of 230$ paperweights.

Sony: makes noise canceling earbudsApple: I’m bouta end this mans whole career

I love ur Channel. My question is how well does the mix work? I love my Galaxy buds but when I talk to people with them im very hard to understand people say. Can I get some input from somebody about these? To me that was the only thing Apple&#39;s headphones had on Samsung was the Mic.

Sony should have called these:  Sony Heir Buds

these are horrible. i wish i never bought them. waiting on the Bose 700

Hey guys quick help. Where and what product can I buy to remove scratches from the stainless steel cover??

Just got a set for Christmas, love them. Have had the Bose QC 30’s for 3 years and they’re brilliant so a tough one to beat and tbh I’ll probably still flit back and forth between them but for use at my desk these are perfect as when someone speaks to me they allow me to hear that specifically whereas the Bose just get me in shit for not hearing 😂

These are garbage

Mine wont connect to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro any ides why? :(

You can get good wired headphones for a tenth of the price. How I miss the jack...

Im literally using the headphones to this vid

Watching this video while using my WF-1000XM3 earphones I got for Christmas

<a href="">7:06</a>

I wish Sony made a workout/active version of these with an ipx rating of some sort. I was thinking about buying these but I was looking for a workout ear bud and sadly, that’s not what these air buds are about.

DONT BUY THEMM ALL THESE REVIEWS ARE SAYS THAT THEY ARE GREAT BUT THEY ARE GARBAGE

The other tip.

Try jaybird earphones

Loooool at my job I get these at cost price so they go from £240 to £120 for me 🔥🔥🔥 unreal

Call quality is unacceptable.

Stop overediting the unboxing experience. Make it one continuous shot until the product is in your hands. This isn&#39;t The Bourne Identity, stop with the quick cuts.

the technology already exists in Comtacs and Sordins for shooters and military forces. They use somewhat similar mechanics to protect hearing while filtering surrounding noise.

Hear this video using sony earbud flex

When you review earphones people would like to know technical aspects and comparisons to competion products like the ones from beats and bose. Your amazement does not tell anything about the product. Where are graphs? SNR? frequency range comparisons???

Somehow i still prefer my btrainers. They might be old tech but are packed with gps, nfc, hr sensor, 16gigs of memory, mic, waterproof (ive used them whem swiming), and obviously have bluetooth. Too bad sony didnt continue to improve them or keep promoting them. Now any pair of headphones that doesnt have all of these things i just consider them to be garbage. In todays standards i just cant accept a pair of hp that dont have at least all of these features as in the btrainers. I really coudnt careless about noisecancellin (btrainers fit tight and i constanty need to be on the lookout for cars around me when runnin) but if its included, itll be cool. Really havent found any hp as awsome as the btrainers. And the 16 gigs of mem feat is just extremely useful specially when my phones dead or when i go out for my miles. Seriously who still carries their phone around their arms when goin for a run? Ive literally even used the btrainers as a freakin usb to transfer files. I think i still have a few movies in them from when i was transfering files from myold comp to my new one. Btrainers are still the best.

But can you wear them at the gym/on a run

Not sure why (maybe my ears are weird, but these things won&#39;t stay in my head. Good product, the app is a little hard to figure out. Returning them for exchange credit. Also don&#39;t like not having volume control on the earphone.

My wife and i bought one of these and compared it to her 70$ chinese ear buds without ANC, neither of us could tell them apart... Just try them out in blinded setting, Same song, same phone, same volume, same room,  have a third person put them in your ear, listen to the same segment of the song and do the same with multiple people. I bet you the improvement in sound and ANC is not that impressive...

its made in malaysia

what chinese lew would look like <a href="">7:08</a>

Stop lying . I buy this because your Review. It is so heavy that you cant wear it for 30 min

Did you even check in outside environment?... It&#39;s bad as fuck and pretty useless... Bought it after seeing your review... Dam was disappointed😔

<a href="">7:14</a> when your little cousin is playing your ps4 without your permission

I have these, for anybody thinking about the software limitations, in terms of the control of volume and other issues raised, sony Updated the software so now everything that was initially missing is there, from the case battery life right down to the volume controls, they are amazing

They sweat proof

It&#39;s good....But can it play the Mii Theme...?

How is the call quality on these? Can people hear you in high quality?

Which is the best sound earphones out there ?😊Can i pay the money worth.

They never give you the right advice in shops.😑

Your advice is brilliant. How good is the sound compares the high end pieces.😘

Fresh price?

Please guys do not buy this earbuds, other person on the phone cannot hear your voice they feel like you&#39;re talking from a tunnel

Review Libratone Track Air+ pleaseeFor this sony alternative

what is the name of the app?

Weakness: No water resistance. Secondary weakness: microphone in busy environments doesn&#39;t compete with the jabras. These are so close to being the very best. I can&#39;t wait for the upcoming models.

How would these fair when working with power tools ?

There ok but if you want that bass and completely noise canceling go with Sony&#39;s over ear extra Bass ones they are just unreal.

Nobody:Samsung: The all-new ZX-32415DF4.4246167737 Version 33!

Lucky me got em for 130

The worst reviews and videos on YouTube can be found on this channel.

No water / sweat resistance as a lifter I cant justify buying them

How do I remove the glossy protective film from the buds?

Hey Lew, Thank you for the great job....keep going!  I wanna know about those ear  headphones for training in the gym are they great for it or the WH1000XM3 will be better? Thks

These are black? They look midnight blue to me.I want these on the colors youre unboxing them with

Just tried sony wf 1000XM3 on the nearest store but dunno why ANC wasn&#39;t blocked thumping music much even my clap. (Tested without music) 🤔

<a href="">7:08</a> When your girlfriend&#39;s father says a unfunny joke and you just wanna smash...

just got AirPods Pro and being someone who witnessed  noise cancelling for the first time...Its magic!!!

One of the best in-ear headphones. Recommend!

The sound quality on these is great - but the internet (myself included) is awash with talk of the microphone being basically unusable for calls....help the people lew!

Bought one... feels weird that this little thing can do this much.

sony makes some dayum good products and their phones can really take a beating..

Those are better value than the air pods pro.

Just got my pair today!!

Damn, he has forgotten to mention that those earphones have literally no water resistance, so I recommend to avoid water and rain at all costs!

Got these for 139 usd

my dad gave me his and I wanted to see what u thought first 💀💀

Yeah, now the Sonys have volume control. 👍

Which ones are better for the S10+, Apple Airpods Pro, or Sony WF-1000XM3? Serious question 😊 Water-proofing isn&#39;t a priority for me. Sound quality is.

The Sony&#39;s got an update. Now you can enable volume control with the touch interface, the battery level of the case is visible in the Headphoes app and Amazon Alexa was added.

With the last update you can control the volume from your earphones... and even check the status of the case battery

Do you guys use noise-canceling while running? It&#39;s dangerous

Hey. Sony have just released an update that now allows you to change the volume on the ear bud and see the case charge level in the app.

Really good earphones

What’s about the video audio latency?

How is the sound when next to people?Can they hear it clearly when played on high volume?

work on playstation 4?

Bought a pair last week and I&#39;m in love with them, first time truly wireless. Sony has always done bass really well and the quality of sound and build is exceptional

Sony : we need a name for our new earbuds Sony employee : throws keyboard down some stairs Sony: Perfect.

SONY WF-1000XM3 or Powerbeats Pro ??which one should I get ??

So who else is listening to this with there sony earbuds 🤘🤘

Please review the SUDIO TOLV

Watching this with earbuds on

Not available in India.... Only WH-1000mx3 is available here...

I know these have no IPX rating but has anyone used them for the gym or anything?

Oh damn, I&#39;m a samsung user and was just about to hit checkout for the samsung pods but then THIS. 230$ though. Blackfriday here we goo

The white ones look better. The black ones kind of look like the old douchebag stereotype earpiece.

English: <b>exists</b>Sony: <b>We don’t do that here</b>

ugh my wallet.. ugh

I have these, but honestly I might return them, they sound slightly better than my MDR-EX750BT, but not enough to constitute a $230 purchase.

<a href="">7:12</a> when you’re lit up in the club and your favorite jam comes on.

&quot;$230, not bad actually&quot; its bad for us

They already have noise cancelling earphones. 2 to 3 years back.

I enjoyed watching your video today

Lmao this guy kills it

and the fucking shit Apple launches AiRpOdS PrO for 250$ , no one knows wtf is wrong with this company

I need help deciding, airpods pro or these???? Please help!

I like your video but please, take off that stupid cap and start using one of a real team as Saint LouisEven Baltimore is better than blue Jays 😂😂😂

<a href="">6:55</a> - <a href="">7:22</a>  his smile explain everything 🤣🤣🤣
Just bought it today

Hi I&#39;m thinking of picking up these and was wondering if the latency Is bad. I read reviews of people saying that

I bought these a couple months ago. If I’m being honest, I think they suck.

$100 BLACK FRIDAY BABYYY

I can clearly see that you are paid to talk good about this one 😂😂

Waiting for Black Friday to get these for cheaper lol

Sony is the best of the best

Guys I’m kinda stuck on which ones to get either these earbuds or apples new AirPods pro I’m a teenager so going school I work out I’ll be working out with these on and I’m gonna get a pair for Black Friday but I’m kinda stuck on which one to get I’m assuming that the Sony’s are going to become cheaper but AirPods pro are going to stay the same price seeing as they’re pro and yeah I’m kinda stuck I would love to hear your opinion for normal everyday use taking it to school water resistant (coolness lmao) and yeah comfort

Oh boy ima gonna flex
Sony wf-1000xm3 vs airpods pro. Which is better?

My jabras are getting worn out. This might be a great replacement.

I can&#39;t stand your fucking voice nor can I stand your hands flailing around in the vid...

Do a review on the Sabbat e12 Ultra

They are not waterproof, if it rains you cannot wear them, if it&#39;s hot and you are sweating you cannot wear them... What&#39;s the point?

<a href="">6:04</a> song name?

Does anyone know the name of the last song/band?

Got - right ear keeps dropping off 🤔

Can you please compare them to the AirPods pro???

Can you please compare them to the AirPods pro???

<a href="">7:10</a> he looks like that kid from stranger things

I wonder which is better. This or the sennheiser true wireless momentum

If call quality matters to you at all... Neither these nor the Airpods Pro offer Qualcomm CVC noise-cancelling, so none of your callers will hear you talking if there&#39;s any noise in your environment. Meanwhile, any $30 Chinese earbuds will have the latest CVC 8.0, and your voice will come through crystal clear to all your callers. I have the WH-1000XM2 and I won&#39;t even attempt to use them on a phone call because everyone says they sound like shit. Sad state of affairs with these high end earbuds that are useless for phone calls.

Ting look like Duracell

Now the question is, those or the airpods pro?

They sound great BUT I have been using these for a month now and they constantly disconnect midway through a call. Using them with an iPhone XS. Firmware and iOS are the latest versions. Anyone else facing this issue ?

Okay honestly, I got these and loved them at first, but over time I grew to hate them. -either they fall out of my ear 24/7 or they stay in rly tight at the cost of being so uncomfortable that they give my ears something similar to the burn you get when you rub an eraser against your skin-touch controls are cool, but you can&#39;t adjust the volume or have full control of things-cant run around with them cus even when tightly secured, they bob around in your head -the case is bulky as hell and doesnt come with a latch for me to use a clip for my belt loop, and the third party cases they have for it always slide off of the case entirely so they aren&#39;t secure. Definitely cannot be fit in the front pockets comfortably unless I want to put my wallet or phone in my back pockets -no fucking water resistence -The touch controls can be heard registering when you want to play or pause something on-screen with the electronic sfx ding, and yet the buds force you to wait a few seconds and try again before the command actually goes through, so you have to be patient for the buds -still 250+ dollars I paid for themInstead, I now have an 80-90 dollar pair of earbuds that have the same if not better sound quality with full volume adjusting ability, a 10 hour life per bud charge, and a 70 hour charge life on the charge pack with room not only for a thing to attach a camelbak clip to for my belt loop, but also a battery life indicator when charging, all of which are things the sonies didn&#39;t have. (They&#39;re the lypertek tevis) In short, fuck you sony. I wanted these to be good, but they are way too overpriced and there are some seriously stupid design decisions here

These are best earbuds I have ever had. Pricey yes. Worth it, hell yes.

Question of the day, do they Bluetooth directly to the PS4?

Did you guys see the character on the app wearing the headphones ACTUALLY BLINKS!!?? HOLY MOLY IS THAT AN UNNECESSARY DETAIL I LOVE TO SEE HAHA

Do they work as good with Apple plones

it should be called XPERIA BUDS, right?

Hey now u never ever say anything bad about sony ok...ok

apple:airpodssamsung:galaxy bidssony:1000xm3hotel:trivago

Worst earbuds ever the sound quality and anc they are good though but theyve got issues with staying in ypur ears not good for people going to the gym or taking a walk.I feel like I spent the money for nothing.

Hey Lew aren&#39;t these like the IQ buds you tested out a couple of years ago?

Still thinkin if this is worth the money

They’re good but sony screwed up some details .. it’s a pain to pair and switch between two devices, missing volume control, and there’s no charge level indicator for the case ...

This or echo buds? Thoughts please?

Lew is the most badass therapist I&#39;ve ever seen😎😎😎

I am using these while watching this video lol. I love them honestly

your cap is more dominating bro

What about the sound quality when compared to airpods?

To top it all off I almost likely to lose these ear piece

I&#39;m still a wire person would prefer it to be a neckband  with a kind of wire

Honestly, they are utter garbage. People talking about awesome noise cancellation on these in ears clearly have no clue what awesome noise cancellation is. Bose/Sony over ear noise cancelling headphones are awesome, these (and the AirPod pro’s) are barely noticable. Also, the touch function is too temperamental. Sometimes it skips track, most of the time it stops the track. Cuts in and out of ambient control all the time. The AirPods are simple and effective. And the sound quality is way better. Wish I’d never sold my AirPods to buy these Had them less than a week. Massively unimpressed.

Or you can ditch expensive Apple, Samsung and Sony earbuds and buy Jlab Executive Air headphones for 69 dollars and get just as good of a product and get yourself some chicken wings with all the money you just saved

The case is just ridiculously big, so uncomfortable to pocket

why do i feel like i missed a video cause i dont know that phone

You think the naming scheme of this is crazy, clearly you have never brought a Mikrotik

Why all YouTubers recently speaking with their hands all over their body??Should it keep fascinated to the video?

Any sound lags? Choosing between AirPods pro and these... but I don’t want sound lag

microphone comparison?
Me

Not going to lie. this is all I need to buy these. The over ear Sony&#39;s by far were the best freaking audio devices I&#39;ve ever purchased. I&#39;ve  used them every day for 2 years. these are such an amazing reprieve from apple and googles bull shit. thanks for being real. I loved my pixel buds but I&#39;m ready for Sony to do it right for the buds. lets be real who else would honestly do it beter?

Dat Netflix intro at <a href="">7:29</a>
Is this loud?

The cost less than AirPods pro and beats pro and they sound better from what I’ve heard

Will it work  without the fancy app?  Most of my media is played off of a non smart device, through a Bluetooth adapter.

As a Jabra Elite Active 65t owner.. I&#39;m dropping some tears now!

Did anyone notice a difference in white/background noise level when noise cancellation is on between right and left buds? My left one is completely silent while the right now has a notable higher level of white noise.

<a href="">7:06</a> LMAOOO MADE ME LAUGH SO MUCH

So these are better than Pros for better battery, noise cancelling &amp; possibly sound quality. These are my 2 options rn

Name of the song <a href="">02:30</a>

Apple: AirPodsSamsung: Galaxy BudsSony: <b>Big Shaq Rapping</b>
It&#39;s it worth if I&#39;m not using on daily basis

They are not sweat resistant   Meh

Are they better than IQ buds

AirPods pro is louder and has better iOS integrations

These are nice.  Buy too big and too heavy for training or to be on the move with those.. I will stay with m2 over ear.

One game changer after another.

And now the AirPods Pro made them obsolete

That case is not so portable tho
