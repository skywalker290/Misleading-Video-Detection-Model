Still sparkling wine in 2024 🎉

Some how i just felt i need to listen this song out of the blues...2024 ❤

It’s sad how far she has come from this joyful teen to now…She is an example of why you should never put your hole in this world. For what does it profit a man to gain the world, but lose His soul???Despite this songs lyrics this life isn’t all we’ve got. This life is just our choice for our eternity.

Is Demi sisters with Emma Hunton that goes by Davia in the TV show Good Trouble? They look so alike especially I this video.

This song is beautiful ❤❤❤❤

I don't know how many times I've listened to this song ❤😅
The song of my childhood 😭😭💖💖💖
She is so beautiful and this song certainly shows off her amazing voice. One of my favorite songs and videos.

yep.....makes tay tay look like fool.

A beautiful, strong voice. She came from humble beginnings in a household without a father figure. The music industry swallowed her up with such <a href="">3:27</a> a disregard how it could affect her mental health. Additionally, professional talent agents that signed her probably recognized something but simply prioritized the amount of money she could derive. 😢

her voice is incredible!!😩

This is truly a masterpiece!❤because of ❤ 💖a u t h e n t i c v i e w s 💖is the key for fame

Yea awesome 👏

Didn’t need to come TikTok for this one.

On Sunday I called your selfon

I'm watching this clip that makes me cry, what a wonderful time
This clip is wonderful, the most wonderful demy of 2011
I remeber listening to this song all the time as a kid and now as an adult the lyrics give it an entirely new meaning. The vulnerability and hope that comes with falling in love with someone and trust them

This song finally makes sense to me

2024 anyone else?

2024?❤
I wonder if I&#39;m the only one who misses Steven cerda

I love this song😊

Here in 2024 and still obsessed with this song 🤩🤩

2024 still listening masterpiece of demi love u since high school ❤

Anyone listening in 2024?❤
Demi was great on every track on Unbroken ❤
Before

Uh I&#39;m watching fall in line video by christina and demi amd it&#39;s exactly what happened to me when Omar was higher up in the gang and I was like I already gave ub5 babies mo more and then he eventually got 2 more out of me and now navid wants me to birth me one. Which I would happily do to be honest and the Cambridge ones too. Tick tick tick. Slow but not for shamina. Oh I feel all this spiritual power oozing out hmmm black god stone power. They might as well pray around me lol

Aisha should just admit the truth of what shamina did to Omar 2 wife and navid wife. Its why their breasts got smaller and shamina got bigger. Same thing happen to me. Also when mine qnd Chris brown son got kidnapped and killed at 3 months the way shamina was screaming to farrouk she wants him and I was like its took me 12 months to birth this child and u filthy two sicko need to just have your own baby together and go to hell. Which they are. Thank u Allah 💓  also why it take 12 years later to have a baby if she was so desperate

2024..just miss this era😢

p

12 years ago, this song released. It reminds me the golden era of my youth at age of 24, the first time after my heartbreaking experience of 4 years earlier that I regained my confidence for a new love. Now I have lived with my gf for 12 years. Every time I heard “don’t wanna break your heart”, shining sunlight always comes into my mind.

I actually thought this was Ariana when I 1st heard it a few yrs back

Break

Perfect song. I love you, Demi &lt;3
This song is a classic for me and I think it will be timeless as is Demi Lovato  -  a timeless classic great voice and talent.  The heart and emotion in your voice and these lyrics has always brought chills to my skin and tears to my eyes.  You really poor your heart and soul into your music.  I love many of your songs for sure but this one is probably my very favorite.

2024 ❤

this song doesn&#39;t bring back good memories, even though it&#39;s beautiful. My cousin, who died of cancer, loved Demi Lovato&#39;s music and especially this song.

Today marks 12 years since this song was released, it&#39;s been a long journey.

I love you, Demi!

2024 and I'm here listening 😅
Its 2024 and  still going with the flow

her voice is incredible!!😩

This song marked my life because I met the woman I loved most in my life, we have a couple of beautiful children, it was a beautiful story but we ended, it was sad because of stupidity, we ended it not because of betrayal, but because of a fight And this song marked my life thank you dismissed lovato
Before Demi went crazy and getting offended about aliens 🤣

I just realized this song is a blatant rip off from that song Unfriend you - Grayson chance

This is her coolest song.
2025 lyrics will be updated to refer to the most common method of telephony which will be brain-internet-brain communication.

They definitely don't make songs like that anymore these days! What an anthem this song is… my God! Timeless!

I recognized the song from her book Stay Strong.❤

I still to this day would preferred if instead of Demi making a collage for the leading man in the video, she walked up to him and unbuttoned her shirt to make this up and change his mind. “After every fight, just apologize. And maybe then I’ll let you try and rock my body right.” -Meghan Trainor

i really miss this era of female pop songs, they gave off a certain energy that music today rarely give off :/

Beautiful music never leaves the top plays and fashion and it gets better and better.

I love you Demi! ❤️🇧🇷

Really cool
14-11-2023🎉
This song never getting old😭 I&#39;ve been heard this song since 2015, and til now, i&#39;m still hear this songgg😭 maybe for my whole life too

To this day I hear the lyrics &quot;as your lips are on my ass, our hearts beat as one&quot;I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s actually saying

Okay

Yep i deserve it❤😂🎉
This hit was almost not a single, see because after Skyscraper it would be Who's the Boy but as the dev was pregnant they chose this anthem and that's a good thing because Hollywood Records only let her work on 2 singles
I simply love the beautiful voice!
My god, I watched this song with my cousin, I was 8 years old, he and I were dancing and missing it 😂❤😢
Still a classic❤
As an American in the Amazon. Praise the lord for helping me  with you have given me. Give my heart a break father from what the embassy has done to an illegally deported American. Sometimes I wish bush was still president. He would&#39;ve...

What is tik tok doing that is causing all these viral YouTube comments? They better not be trolling these masterpieces.

This is my favorite song by demi 💜💜💜
The day I first met you

You told me you&#39;d never fall in love

But now that I get you

I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are

So close yet so far

Haven&#39;t I passed the test?

When will you realize

Baby, I&#39;m not like the rest

Don&#39;t wanna break your heart

Wanna give your heart a break

I know you&#39;re scared it&#39;s wrong

Like you might make a mistake

There&#39;s just one life to live

And there&#39;s no time to wait, to wait

So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break

Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

Oh, yeah, yeah

On Sunday you went home alone

There were tears in your eyes

I called your cell phone, my love

But you did not reply

The world is ours

If we want it, we can take it

If you just take my hand

There&#39;s no turning back now

Baby, try to understand

Don&#39;t wanna break your heart

Wanna give your heart a break

I know you&#39;re scared it&#39;s wrong

Like you might make a mistake

There&#39;s just one life to live

And there&#39;s no time to wait, to wait

So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break

Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

There&#39;s just so much you can take

Give your heart a break

Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

Oh, yeah, yeah

When your lips are on my lips

And our hearts beat as one

But you slip out of my fingertips

Every time you run

Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh

Don&#39;t wanna break your heart (Don&#39;t wanna break your heart)

Wanna give your heart a break

I know you&#39;re scared it&#39;s wrong

Like you might make a mistake (I know you&#39;re scared it&#39;s wrong)

There&#39;s just one life to live

And there&#39;s no time to wait, to wait

So let me give your heart a break (Let me give your heart)

&#39;Cause you&#39;ve been hurt before

I can see it in your eyes

You try to smile away

Some things you can&#39;t disguise

Don&#39;t wanna break your heart

Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache

So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break

Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

There&#39;s just so much you can take

Give your heart a break

Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

Oh, yeah, yeah

The day I first met you

You told me you&#39;d never fall in love

This should be the Weight Watchers theme song.

If someone notices this, I&#39;m still alive and fighting depression

Who that boy in the Video

I love it ❤️
My favorite song of hers 🇧🇷🇧🇷💗💗
2023 I'm still listening to it 😊
Still breathing deeply because I lived at the same time as when Give Your Heart a Break was released, I was only 10 years old and now at 21, it still hits so hard and is eternalized inside me like Lovatic ∞🇧🇷

This song never loses its shine in BRAZIL 🇧🇷 10/23/2023

Still listening in 2023 .Who else?

I have not listened to this song in so long. Wow, Demi’s voice has changed a lot. They sound like Camila Cabello here.

To the person reading this, even though I don&#39;t know you. I wish you the best of what life has to offer 🙏 🙌 😊❤

Demi Lovato is now a freak. Sad

Music across all genres was so much better years ago! Something changed around 2015 and everything just went to hell.

Yes I am well aware that someone very specific is feeling  lost unsure and realize she has a huge option to sit down directly speak freely in a relaxed mature conversation that at least will bring much healing straightforward answers but at most that Is only out person Lord and Savior Jesus knows so why am I not calling this woman out because it&#39;s more than obvious if us two can at worst work together but there something much more I do fully believe wait and see I miss you strongly glad relieved that I have blown away everyone of everybody preconceived notions personally but professionally to even record a CD with the working title killers of conformity possible a brand new group of never before seen ppl together all at once call on MBC to drop our syndrome on all.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤xxxoooxxxoo

Demi Lovato you are a great singer I admire you a lot as a musical artist and as a person

2023?

Never fall in love?Divorced.Heartbreak?

The day i first met you
These years I really thought she was coming from another planet whenever I heard this voice on the radio

I love my baba so much. So many people before me treated him so wrong, so unjust, so evil... it breaks my heart every time we hit a moment he recoils in hesitation or reinforces himself behind his mask. I hope all people who have been burned n abused thru love find their people; we deserve compassion, understanding and space to find ourselves. Be well.

wow im so old, still love this song tho

Demi Got Very Great Vowels,  How didn&#39;t I notice about her music ???🎤🎙

i miss these days bad

Demi Lovato is one Artist who proves that not all 2010s music is trash!  This decade I think is overlooked when people talk about good music.

❤❤so true sweetheart husband angel forever infinity and beyond the universe kyky kykyyyyyy kai angel and

It&#39;s a great, I like it  thanks my friend. 🎤😍

VH1 or MTV music videos raised it loud while I cleaned my room.

Demi come back to us with this kind of music THE WORLD NEEDS THIS!!🥺💜

I liked Demi with black hair more at the time but i didn’t realize how beautiful she looks with this hairstyle

I recorded a song of mine if you checked it out would mean very much for me 🖤

That music ❤

I was watching swac and remembered this song while going mad 4 channy

<b>sigh</b> I miss her.

This song reminds me of my school childhood😢😢
I only come to hear part 0.04-0.40. I don’t know why, but just like how it sounds.

about love

Oh it&#39;s her

It passes so quickly. The time when teenagers live their lives as if they have various stories to feel.😢😢😢😢
Stay safe😅❤❤❤
This song brings me back to good old memories. Who&#39;s still here with me listening to this now? This is one of my favorite songs of Demi.

The rock version she released is so much better haha

Is this song for joe??

I like this music 🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Watched  this masterpiece from YouTube 11 years Ago and come again today 17/8/2023

...achpolo. strong strong. 8889
Absolutely beautiful human.  Glad you made it😊

There could be an option to find older comments first on YouTube Kk. I think there must be some comment from more than 10 years ago here. I remember I used to hear this song at Lan house lol
I love this song

Flashback old the moment when me young

How I wish i could turn back time😢 2009 2012 era❤

I hate this song. Stop playing games

OMG

LSS

Whoa, it&#39;s been 11 years already? It feels like yesterday! Here I am, walking down the memory lane of old Demi Lovato&#39;s old songs. 😍

i change my phone a couple of times but this song never leave my music player..

Soar high queen.. Now its her time🔥🔥🔥

Anyone at 2023 !

11 years of this hymn, I feel old 😂❤
Pronaam mathaji
Wow, these songs from 2010 to 2012 are too perfect. Look at this beat, this melody, this voice, this production. I miss that kind of quality.
It would be nice if they dedicated this song to me.
😊😊😊😅😅 <a href="">3:36</a>
Still one of my fav song form Demi ❤

This was peak Demi before she went woke. I want her back. I miss her.

Beautiful music  ❤️👍
What happened to u , may God bless ur soul.

Oh god I&#39;ve misunderstood this song for so long. I thought the title meant &quot;Let me break your heart&quot;. big whoops

I dont really know why i am tearing up or how im so numb but feeling so much at once. I believe the answer is between myself and someone who im sure she agree let us return to how we last saw the other and completely unopen our thoughts emotions about one another to the other and im willing to do this because this last answer im sure is going to be clear between us

Music that marked my adolescence. At that time there was only international top music
Ah yes, before she became a space alien 3 spirit bugself zebrakin.

enjoy this music

by far my favorite song ever
This song reminds me of my break ups it&#39;s makes sad 😢

Very amazing 🎉

I love you Demi

This song is well balanced classic

My appearance is that it came from the book Stay Strong because the author wrote the names of her songs in the book
Not really a Lovato fan but this one is her best for sure

This song reminds me of gymcrush
Cruz you guys are welcome 🤗 come here for me and I’ll be home 🏡 so you you. Cruz you guys are welcome babe babe I’m okay 👌

This song is an absolute masterpiece! It would make a fine candidate for study in music school for how to compose, sing, produce and play a number 1 hit. What a work of art ❤

Linda❤❤❤❤👏🏻🌷🎶👏🏻🌷🎶
L❤ve you DeMi ❤lovato
Back when its a normal human being

Man she used to be something

Music perfect for listen

We don't search for old songs, but old memories
I must say that Demi Lovato would have been better if she hadn't been a compulsive cocaine addict, today I hate her as a person and as a singer, she would do better if she retired from singing and went to work in a shop since she opened a very special one. From Tambuzzo Giuseppe from Milan Lombardy Italy
I&#39;m here again after episode deleted demi lovato path to fame😢

I love you demi
Shes old and fat now

August 19, 2023

this song still helps me too to pass on this difficult time after a happy relationship that ends just by him being afraid to continue...thank you DEMI!!

This song deserves so much more views

Man, remember when Demi Lovato was pretty and not a whacky SJW that believed in Aliens and Ghost relationships?

2023 anybody??

I&#39;m not from tik tok I really like some of her uplifting songs like this even though romantic relationships are confusing to me

I saw this beautiful song on tiktok and came to listen to it complete here
Demi, Selana and Miley grew up in the best time of Disney ❤

I’ve been through a lot of heartbreaks in the past but this recent one was different.. She was toxic, abusive, &amp; and hard to get away from. I know it’s considered “Weak” for guys to cry but I was doing a lot of that. I came back to this song cuz it really makes me feel better. It makes me forget abt everything that happened.

So beautiful, it&#39;s a shame what she&#39;s become these days. A shell of a former superstar.P.s. I don&#39;t hate or dislike Demi in any way, I&#39;m just giving a point. ( I rlly shouldn&#39;t have to specify that, but ppl these days).

I love her ❤️❤️❤️

I was 8/9 years old I miss young pan
her best song
I miss this demi Lovato 😭

When did 11 years pass! Legendary song :)

I swear that since I was little, I've always loved this song. Despite not understanding English at the time, the clip was shown at Disney and I thought it was beautiful, the scenery, Demi's voice and Demi herself. Unfortunately, I feel like that Demi from the past stayed there and now a weird woman sings songs on her channel...
I was 11 years old....💔😷
this was my SONG

I MISS THIS

I am listening this since i was 8 yrs...now i&#39;m 19yrs😂
