Miss you this ️
BOYCOTT <b>Druggie</b>  BULLIWEED  , we don&#39;t pay for their drugs !We made them superstars but nobody from these superstars uttered a single word for Justice for Our Dearest Sushant watch only pirated versions of all movies of these druggies from now onwards.Don&#39;t go in theatres to pay for their drugs . Show them the power of Sushant fans

Sushant came to us  from FUTURE !He was way ahead of us all in every aspect.WE were( are)  too ignorant to appreciate , understand Him.I can imagine how he might be feeling interacting with low I.Q. people around Him. That might be a  reason of him being introvert or shy.We are unlucky to loose  one in a million Gem , due to our own fault.<a href="">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a>

Who all was here to watch 100% Sushant only

What happened today ?????????
Today my senior has sent 
justice for him

Brother, I want love, this is the only thing. Miss you Sushant Singh Rajput.
Sach mein hero ta

Justice for sushant singh rajpot..

The hero of the group is not the hero of the world️.. this is called the hero of personality and not of your sister-in-law 5 ft.
Talented person I have ever watched

Miss you Anni 
If sushant didn&#39;t justice to the way of law Then we should boycott who boycotted sushant nepo kids and karan johar schl students&quot;&quot;

Chhichhore is my favourite movie 
Lucky to be born in the era of sushant

His Murderers will not Rest in Peace even in the hell

We&#39;ll miss you Anni (Sushant Singh Rajput)and may your soul rest in peace  ️️️️️️️️️️️️
Only the group is not a hero, he is the hero of INDIA
He is not group hero,he is India&#39;s hero

Group ka nhi pure India ka hero 
Now let me tell you exactly. Who knows you? We are not the ones who eat you. His brother snatched away his sister. Now there will be justice.
Miss you sushant sir

We want justice for sushant singh rajput

Miss you Anni miss you too much
Anni is the actual hero in reality also!️ The hero for everybody!

Miss uh anni️always remain in our hearts ️
Sushant is best actor and he is a best dancer and a great person ️️

<a href="">#justiceforsushant</a><a href="">#justicefordisha</a>

Not all of SSR films flopped , he had major hits like chhichore,  Ms dhoni, Kedarnath, Kai po che So why on earth are people blaming his death on nepotism and him not getting many projects. Hollywood has actors that have humble origins and some make it big irrespective of having a couple setbacks If SSR had depression, it must have been for a more private reasonSSR was a fantastic actor and it&#39;s a shame what happened .

Miss you very much my dear fan ️️
Miss you
We will miss u Anni️

Come back yaar, please come back...... 

We&#39;ll miss you anni....Rest in peace

Sushant gave up his life to save Disha Salian. Who does that in today&#39;s world? Some people robbed him of his money, took advantage of his simplicity and then when the iron was hot, they killed him

It feels so good to read good comment about ssr even 10 month ago, wish he had seen these.

Man, this movie was very funny when you abused Pratik Babbar.
Sushant is the best actor of bollywood

Anni is my favourite character among them️ and he&#39;ll always be ️

No one ...told him that he is a good actor till he died now everyone is praising him...we are not realising that this is our mistake..we were the people who didn&#39;t gave him attention

My favourite film Sushant I miss you thank you for the film Sushant Singh Rajput and team Shraddha and Varun thankyou Shradha Kapoor and Varun Sharma 62773883838893

And he went on... After biting his beloved, he went on, hoping to get the pleasure that he would have given you.. He went on with all his pain... After losing a lot, he reached his destination, Abhi told us a lot. The dreams are still there... But now those dreams... Only these dreams will come true... Because if I went on dreaming then it would have hurt a lot... It would have hurt a lot... When you would have killed me. .. Look at this cruelty of yours.. He left with a broken heart... ️️️️️️️Plz guys raise your voice for CBI Investigation  . It is the right time to show a fan power motiv. We have to do it for SSR's sunshine  smile.  <a href="">#justiceforSSR</a>

CHHICHHORE

The other friends have specific ability , Ani have only the one who can pick a girl..so he became hero

I loved his character until i saw derek

I need part 2 of chhichhore

2 min silence for those who are thinking ki hum log bhi college ja kr yeh sb kre ge. Aur phir ldki bole gi Bhai me ne bhi chhichhore Dekhi ha 

Sushant ️️️
Audiences nowadays will not buy a ticket for themselves and watch a film for 2(1/2) hours or 3 hours unless there is some kind of hype or mystery(hysteria) created around the film and unless the film will draw yr attention and excite you within to watch the film before it releases in the form of teasers, trailers.

Films of today&#39;s times need to have flaws(a few plotholes) in their storyline, screenplay and dialogues in order to become successful and so that the audience can understand what is happening on the screen and relate to it.

Sushant sir love you blockbuster
Gold spot cold drink dikha retro look k liye...I&#39;m missing gold spot
