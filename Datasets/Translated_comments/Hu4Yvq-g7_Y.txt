For me, it&#39;s driving and mountain biking, so I record audio notes that I listen to and turn into actions later on.

His voice is so soft it makes it hard to pay attention to what he’s saying

This is gold. Thanks, Chris.

It is really worth for me to learn. Thank you guys

One of the best video I have never seen❤

Thenks

Where can I see the video in English?
Actually world and live in real word is fabulous amazing live journey

Great speech. Technology remaind always our mind busy.the best solution to solve this problem to set the time of using the gadgets....

I&#39;m taken by this. I had the privilege of reading something similar, and I was truly taken by it. &quot;Mindful Mastery: Living Intentionally in a Chaotic World&quot; by Kyle Ash

Amazing 💯💯
i came from insta reels

Guys just focus on the vid nd don&#39;t bother about comments. Ignore it

Doesn&#39;t reducing work days and compartmentalization help with both unemployment and focus of people

Okay but I need constant stimulation bc of ADHD. Does this apply differently for people with ADHD?

This is a good video
Just what i needed this is a sign

what a great talk i just put a new target of this topic

This is a lecture. It is  really what my mind need at this point in my life.

I got distracted watching the whole video due to phone.

👉your twinflilm 🧠👈👉🫀Who is frist seelp? 🤔
Thank you :)

Tq so much ❤
Nothing is never wrong but people doing them.  Focusing on assuming ain&#39;t getting people nowhere these days

I&#39;ve been struggling with this so much recently. I loved the insight and awareness that this video brings. We don&#39;t need to do more, we need to do less but with focus.

It&#39;s doing laundry for me

Thank you Mr Chris Baily for sharing your thoughts and journey

I instantly got distracted

I suggest you all a nice book, Deep Work by Cal Newport, it will change your life

This was Great

“Your brain crave distractions to get the dose of dopamin“ best line

Focus on goal the Instagram Facebook and social media cannot feed you in future

Easy 💯
I pay a girl for a massage and a long shower and now i have the best ideas ever 😎

Thank you 😊
If I&#39;m not wrong getting the conclusion of this talk then it&#39;s saying that we should make boredom an important part of our lives which will help us to get rid of over-stimulation state which had result in releasing more dopamine through which our mind stopped wandering and was not able to produce enough attention span. Hence if we can focus on the direction and the nature of our ideas and thoughts then we can put ourselves in a state of being FOCUSED.Also, An amazing thing which he said that &quot;We are doing too much that our brain never wanders and that&#39;s sad&quot; itself shows that our brain really requires some mental space and productive state through that boredom phase in which it will bring out ideas and thoughts by wandering to help in achieving required FOCUS.As per my understandings :-)

How many zeros are there in the first 10k digits of pie?

I am very happy to see this content, it is very inspirational and motivates me to be better

i hardly focus on complete lecture.it was great till 4th minute😂

Thought this was jesse

<b>ooooooo</b>

Watching this video on my laptop, while using my phone lmaoo

Valuable resource

I&#39;m really struggling to pay attention to this video.

Why don't you have subtitles in Romanian?
Absolutely brilliant !!

Funny how once he said we think 28% about the present. I was already thinking about the remaining 60% not really focusing about what he was saying about the present.

The state of our attention is what determines the state of our livesIf we&#39;re distracted in each moment Those moments of distraction and overstimulation build up and accumulate to create a life that feels more distracted and overwhelming like we don&#39;t have a clear direction.  BUT , when we become less stimulated when we make our mind more calm we get the benefits of added productivity and focus and ideas and creativity but we also live a better life because of it. <a href="">15:47</a>

Top Info! thanks for sharing!

He sounds like Mr beast

so boring I can&#39;t

Just like i watching this video for learning English 😂

This guy did research indeed.

I saw this video on my feed, and can&#39;t make my brain focus to watch this video 😅

I don&#39;t use a phone. I keep it put away in a drawer, powered off, always.I borrow my wife&#39;s phone for a few minutes if I really need something.

&quot;We do too much,&quot; says man who wrote 25,000 words of research on a whim.

Super🫶👍
I would want to get rid of my phone but I have so much FOMO, since every update I get comes from my phone

I got ideas while watching motivational videos, I saw this video while surfing internet, would have never known this fact if I wasn’t

Thank you mr 😢.now i understand my self.
POV: I am watching this with my phone. Hayss technology...

The same thing happened to me while preparing for class 12th I am totally out of technology intensionlay  so after some time my brain 🧠 Start getting dopamine from studying itself.. and more calmer I became. I am starting to get new ideas . sleep quality has improved drastically.. but In college I am not able to get back to the same routine I know how great and magical it was .

Thanks a lot for this informational video

This video really just helped me to sit with myself and focus

It made a lot of sense to me that my brain was overexcited and that my ability to concentrate was being disrupted. It's true that when I'm on my phone, I tend to look for something interesting. Thinking back to when we didn't have cell phones, our brains weren't constantly immersed in this pleasurable state, and we had to think about how to spend our free time, instead of looking for fun things quickly, we took the time to find them. , I think that it was because of this process that the brain was not immersed in excessive excitement and was in a moderate state of excitement.
Anyone in 2024.

Lamo 😶‍🌫 watched this video with distract  mind

All universe ❤ anahata boptisom first __ jesus christ

Clearly, this guy doesn&#39;t have children.

Notes for Lang:- Tells a personal story - Creates 3 groups in which he will do a process of analysis on throughout the video - Attention Span- More Ideas - More Plans- - Finds Problem - Brains are overstimulated- His month of boredom - showcases credibility and more personal experience- sit with your thoughts, makes you more creative and think of ideas- identify two fundamental shifts- we think we need to fit more in but in actually, we are doing enough, to much that our mind doesn&#39;t wander. WE NEED MORE SPACE. - distraction is not the enemy of focus. overstimulation is!!!!! (many points where he is explaining/rewriting common misconceptions)- call to action for audience - become less stimulated. <a href="">15:04</a>- The state of our attention determines the state of our lives

Bro i can&#39;t watch this video for 2 min 😢

i have learned some key things from this talk, an urge to know myself better bring me here , to find an answer , why am i like this , why i cant focus on myself,  why i am not successfull yet and still hustling, why i am easily influenced by others and other profession. i cant focus on one thing, just keep changing my plans and works, i am 24 and still not understand what i want to be, what is my goal, where i am heading.

funny how you still wear the same digital watch

It&#39;s funny how I am watching this Ted Talk to improve my attention span yet I am losing focus in every 10 seconds.

Watching from Guyana, South America... I believe this is our year

Watching from Guyana, South America...

this is sooo trueee i get sooo many unique ideas when im sitting on the commode at night when everyone is sleeping and my work is done like 1 hr ago but i&#39;m still sitting there staring at the wall

Dance sing Talk with an to real people

I have so much notes from my mind. Sometimes to much 😅

So maybe no ADHS or to much Stimulation ?

Amazing video, thank you.I recently decided to change things in my life by making things that will help me make money.Thanks for sharing and the motivation

<a href="">00:56</a> 📱 Excessive screen time can impact focus; reducing phone usage led to improved attention span and increased creativity.



<a href="">03:53</a> 🧠 Our brains are overstimulated, seeking distraction; understanding the root cause helps address focus issues.



<a href="">07:45</a> 🤔 Embracing boredom and reducing stimulation can expand attention spans, fostering creativity and new ideas.



<a href="">09:11</a> 🌌 Letting the mind wander in &quot;scatter focus&quot; mode enhances creativity, with a focus on past, present, and future thoughts.



<a href="">12:40</a> 🚗 Creating space in our lives, rather than hustling, is essential for improved focus and generating innovative ideas.



<a href="">13:36</a> ⏰ Distraction isn&#39;t the enemy; it&#39;s a symptom of overstimulation. A two-week challenge to reduce stimulation can reveal positive changes in attention and creativity.



<a href="">14:37</a> 📴 Implementing disconnection rituals, like daily Internet breaks and technology Sabbaths, helps in reconnecting with the physical world and improving overall well-being

Was so focussed on this video, an ad came, I was irritated by the distraction. Then the ad went away and continued my focus. My mind became light and I continued till the end of the video. ❤

Thank you for this great  video 📹

ecellent TED talk, thank you

Just focus on video not comment 😅

i am doing this experiment from now

I&#39;ll start this 2 weeks challenge today &gt;&lt;

I apply his advice right away. I was watching this while doing indoor bike, I always watch video while doing indoor bike because otherwise &quot;it&#39;s boring&quot;. Well I did the last 15 min of my work out without any video nor music :D .

Wow... I really like ur video. From this video i learned lots of thinks. Thank you❤

Wow, so simple, yet so profound. I like this. I will return to it.

THAT&#39;S GOOD! I LOVE IT VERY MUCH❤
I cant focus on this video for too long

Wow. Watching this video while I needed to focus to finish my work😅

I really needed this video 😢

Why everyone talk about social media and smartphone (technology)...?

What an era when I don&#39;t have phone to look at videos like this😢

Interesting talk, but not about attention or focus. This talk is about nurturing creativity and generating ideas... Two very different things.

one line summary : phone&#39;s the damn problem

Why ars u watching this......Do u think 🤔?

It&#39;s hard for me to stay focused. So I don&#39;t know what this video is about and what effect it has.

I have very good focus, but only when I on my phone.

Comments are helpful but they distract us

Just hoped on a call with Canadian airline baggage claimResdy to waste 3 hours😢

i just want to add that this also depends on the person - for example, i am COMPLETELY offline 2/3rds of the year (8 months)but my life is still so BUSY that this doesn&#39;t happen for me.find the midway between what works for you and what science says could work for you

i realize i wasted so much time on my phone. your advice is very useful from reducing time on phone and minimize distractions. So i can practice my concentration to do my work better

I&#39;m captivated by the clarity of this content. A book with comparable insights was a turning point in my journey. &quot;A Life Unplugged: Reclaiming Reality in a Digital Age&quot; by Theodore Blaze

I find this video so helpful. thanks :)

u should write a book for this topic!

I&#39;m not able to focus on his words

This should be studied in schools. Pretty much every TED should be. It&#39;s amazing know that almost everything which is essential in your life and professional life is not studied by school, supposed to learn you basic abilities in your daily life, but the world teaches it to you, the own life, and with your own own efforts you have to comprehend these things.

amazing sharing
what a great way to explain everything about hyper focus....The skill to avoid distraction extremely plays a vital role in self development😍😍 outstanding work❤

Very helpful video Thanks

i could not focus on this...

never think of it that way. but i cant agree more, it&#39;s not distraction but overstimulation that is the true enemy of focus and creativity.

If you came here after it was hard to study check in <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a>

Wonderful video and i don&#39;t know how top express my gratitude. This video taught me the importance of time and talking about me in every day majority time i spend at social medias like Facebook, Instagram and snapchat and i have no idea like how much time i spending this apps. After watching this video i got an clarity about how to manage our time and also how to do attention to focus deeper. Once again thank you Mr. Chris Bailey for the amazing video and i really enjoy it and also i recommending each and everyone for to understand the value of time and also how to focus our goals and how to avoid distractions.

Now that YouTube frowns on ad blockers, as I&#39;m trying to focus on this video, up pops an ad. wtf

STAYING FOCUSED 

“what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore—plays in defining the quality of our life.”

― Cal Newport, Deep Work:


Don’t seek distractions. Allow yourself to get bored.

When you don’t have anything to do - like Internet, movies, calls etc, your brain would crave doing anything, even the difficult jobs of studying or practising your craft.



Don’t give unnecessary dopamine release to your brain. And when you give make sure the source of Dopamine release is natural and physical and not digital or via the Internet. &quot;Starve your Distractions, feed your focus&quot;.



Meditate. Learn to focus on breath. Develop the skill of laser-sharp focus. This will help you for the rest of your life to do better work in less time in all facets of your life. 



Everything takes time and this will take time as well but isn’t it worth it considering how much distracted and unfocused this world is - you will become invincible by actively practising focus. 



Limit Screen Time (Avoid whenever possible)

Rediscover boredom (Detox your artificially inflated dopamine level)

unless you have adhd, then it s never blank!

I am happy that YouTube recommended this video to me this is super awesome.whenever our minds feel free then it goes on a creative road .I am writing for someone to read this I just feel good 😊 .

Key point: Just put the phone down

What a great way to secure a good average view duration, by posting a lecture on focus!

Thank you so much

It&#39;s important to get rid of TV news. They put a lot of information (from someone&#39;s point of view) that distracts a lot. Maybe it&#39;s obvious and the speaker did not even mention about this.

Once I read the lyrics of a rap song but in the inverted version.

I also love to nut in all the terms you just mentioned

Your English is very high but I understand

Oh very nice ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊
Thank you so much

When he gets free time and does something where less or no focus (scatter focus) needed his mind wanders. But when I am doing something like that my mind starts daydreaming. 😢 Now I need a video about how to stop daydreaming or creating fake scenarios in head.😞

Catecholamine chemicals
not much able to understand but  a single point which i am able to understand is that reduce the screen time of phone to reduce overstimulation of mind

I cant focus on this videooooo

What kind of type this is it monolog or short talk

What if we are so focused on the work that we are not able to even sleep, that time we do need distraction

THANKS

He surely knows the proper sequence of delivering a convincing and crystal-clear speech. Thank you for the efforts; the video was amazing!

I watched this while scrolling through TikTok.

I dont think title should be how to focus. Its more to do with how to let your mind wander and get creative.

Summary In this talk, the speaker describes his own experience of being constantly distracted by technology and screens. He conducts two experiments, one where he limits his phone use to 30 minutes a day, and another where he intentionally tries to be bored for an hour a day. He finds that both experiments lead to an expansion of attention span and an increase in creative thinking. He explains that our brains are overstimulated by technology and crave distraction, which is why we struggle to focus. He suggests that letting our minds wander in a state of &quot;scatter focus&quot; can lead to more creative ideas and plans for the future. He encourages people to find simple activities that allow their minds to wander and be creative.

My ADHD self laughing at your problembeing only the phone.

I have to work but have been side-tracked by this video.

Short summary-If you reduce distraction (mobile)- it lowers stimulation - benefits of reducing distraction 1) more focus span2) more ideas3) more plans for future - brain distraction (symptom)-- Brain over stimulation (cause)--becuz of reward(dopamine)-- boredom-- transition from higher to lower stimulation-- requires 8 days-- when u focus on only thing at a time your focus span will increase (ex: meditation)-- best ideas hit when u dont focus on anything(u doing nothing-low stimulation level)<del>-when we rest our attention--brain focus on past(12%), present(28%), future(48%)-</del> known as scatter focus-- find where and when-<del>u wander---give time to that task-</del> brain will hit with new ideas-- two fundamental shifts regarding thinking and attention 1) we not need to fit more in, rather we need more space--give some me time--do nothing away from everyone just u and ur mind2) distraction is not the enemy of focus, overstimulation is main culprit --  state of our attention, determine  the state of our lives--if you are more stimulated you feel overwhelmed  and vice or versa-- all those who wander are not lost

this is exactly what i did unknowingly  this video was a realization that was actually brilliant i thought laziness is not good but at  same time i was thinking why i am getting ideas out of empty space or laziness

Why is he holding something in his hand

Thank you🙏

thanks for the video

The audio is a bit low 😑

Thank you so much.❤
Truth

AOORICIATE FOR YOUR PRESENT, IT VERY HELPFULL

Stop reading the comments, 😢 Focus on the speech ❤

too much story telling and failing to get to the point

Thank you more❤️
I argee the teachnology is useful but nowdays everyone spends lots of time to work or relax on the smartphone,computer,telivison,... it is waste your time in my mind i think people should not abuse smartphone or computer but you can use it about 1 to 2 hours each day

you mean meditation?
I listen to this video more than 4 times; every time I come up with incredible ideas. Thanks.

oh right

This is exactly what I have encountered—too much stimulation. I felt anxious when I  was bored and didn&#39;t have enough stimulation.

Distraction is the enemy of focus not stimulation. Less stimulation more calmness more calmness. Wonderful perspective is shared.

Thank you it helps me so much god bless

&quot;Phone bad&quot;There, I saved you 16 minutes

Ironically, we would have watched you video, hadn&#39;t we have a screen.

bro sounds like luca kaneshiro...
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/CIW60IPp_dYCFcuqTgodEu4IlQ"></a> Fascinating

Brilliantly explained

Mobile Tecnology has trapped us for about 20 years but even before this technology we were not enlightened beings even then we were trapped in other types of contemporary divices and problems

This is true for a normal brain. If you have trauma, anxiety disorder or any &quot;brain issues&quot; so to speak, this doesn&#39;t apply!

But the ads disturbed my focus, and now I&#39;m here.

All of us watching this on the technology and taking a break

Dastardly
this guy is now dead...rip...and he was 61 when this video was published he is looking too young...

Everything is not phone or digital devises how about we are overthunker so that we can not focus on things

whats funny, is I wanted to use watch ted talks, because they are not very stimulating.

After experimenting for 4 years this does not work. If you want to quit technology,  you will need to hire someone to monitor your emails and messages or else you will miss important information and pay fees in late payments, deadlines, and projects, so I guess this guy&#39;s advise is only for CEO&#39;s who can pay for their own assistants because that is really what we all need is/are Personal Assistants to do the grunt work while we think.

So clear and interesting. I had the same experienced, having my brain crammed of information: when your mind and your body sent you these kind of signals (out of focus, attention dropping) you have to take a rest and, above all, to detox from your personal devices.

When u watching this video u turn your focus on video never getting distracted any thing just listen and understand what was talking this man  every sentence you understand deeply consiously still focus your mind in one direction then analysis don&#39;t scrolling down just focus in. Inner

its funny that i watched this without focusing xD

but brain wants to not focus 😢

Thank U. 1000% truth. Every morning I try to stay 10 min in empty cozy café and just think over past and coming day. Reflections and feelings, dreams and thoughts. P.S. At &quot;no gadget time&quot; books can fill the gap too. Good books )

I watch the video because I can&#39;t keep my focus to study. The thing is, I can&#39;t even focus on this video, kept going to IG instead 😅

Really this is very helpful

Thank you Chris or sharing this amazing message to me :)

So we just  need a rough book rather than mobile atleast for sometime 😊

Absolutely loved it!

I already tried to skip the video 3 seconds in💀 I need help

Well this video is too long for me

Underwhelming. This was one of the worst Ted Talks I ever saw. Just go to the last eight minutes. Nothing new. Just disconnect from technology ....that’s the gist of it. Really, Don’t waste your time. Very disappointed

I have already used <a href="">15:56</a> minutes of total 30 mins phone time today!😂

I cant get my brain to focus on this video. What do I do?

So true, I was so focused

Indeed helpful❤
And not even able to focus this

1. Limit your time with technology 2. Detox from technology3. Do a hobby/activity that takes less focus or concentration

you&#39;re watching this video from a screen 👀

Sometimes when i disconnect internet im feeling more lonely. Im bored of social media so i just go to YouTube

Re discover boredom Less stimulated Less time of phoneScatter focuz

phone wasted my life from march 2020 to 4 june 2023😢😢😢😢😢😢😢get less stimulated!

This video was the best ted talk ever

forced focus out of spontaneity keeps you away from grace

I was working then looked at my phone 40 seconds later

😂the screens in our lives

The video is a nutshell of the books “Hyperfocus” and “Deep work” .

Now I the importance of maths

Enriching content! Thank you very much.

Awesome Ted!!! Very helpful!

The easiest thing ever you can do , it&#39;s easy as breath.. unless you have an electronic sensor software planted in the midst of the brain nerouns network..

I wish I could completely get rid of social media, but for work and online presence, unfortunately it&#39;s a must. &quot;If you can&#39;t be found online, you don&#39;t exist&quot;Let me try this 2-week challenge. 8 pm seems too early. I&#39;ll go for No internet from 10 pm to 7 am.

I do have such a problem. I can’t even focus on a 15min video, teaching you how to focus

love this video. i woke up and needed to see this today. I have been looking for the correct term of how my mind has been and i found it, Over Stimulate&quot;. Thank you for this amazing video.

I got rid once of my distractions and got hypersomnia..... Any tips?

Overview : it takes 8 days for our brain to shift from one set to another , &amp; reduce your screen time to 30 mins or maybe an hour whatever you do , you gotta do in those minutes either reading an email or talking to someone so whatsoever &amp; it inhances  your ability to focus , not very flawlessly but still increases

So this is why shower thoughts are a thing

Short summary Intentionally managing your attention: Emphasize the importance of being deliberate about what you pay attention to, and intentionally directing your focus towards your most important tasks.Reducing distractions: Minimize potential distractions such as notifications, emails, and social media in order to stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked.Prioritizing tasks:  Prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency, and tackling the most challenging tasks during your peak hours of focus.Embracing boredom:  Embrace moments of boredom and use them as an opportunity to recharge and refresh their minds.Taking breaks: take regular breaks to avoid burnout and maintain productivity over the long term.

Mine is juggling, anyone else! 🤹‍♀️
Distractions will always be there. You have to learn how to keep them away from your activities. This talk is one of the best ones!

Are you people for real I gave him nine mins and this guy is as boring as watching ice melt.

JESUS LOVES YOU ALL ❤
quotationA state that we noticed determines the state of our life

Thank you for sharing your knowledge

Putting ads in this video made me lose focus 😢

Chris Bailey delivered a TEDx talk in which he shared his observations about the impact of technology on our attention and focus. Bailey noticed that his constant exposure to screens and devices had made him uncomfortable, and he decided to conduct an experiment by limiting his phone usage to just 30 minutes per day for a month. As a result, he noticed that his attention span improved, he had more ideas, and his mind was more focused on the future. Bailey explained that our brains are overstimulated and that we crave distractions, which is why we find it difficult to focus. He shared that when we work in front of a computer, we focus on one thing for just 40 seconds before switching to doing something else, and when we have distractions like Slack open, this lowers to 35 seconds. Bailey concluded that by reducing the level of stimulation we receive, we can improve our focus and attention.

The funny thing is my urge to play my phone is so strong when i  watch this video. LMAO

Don t we all ?! ❤❤
I need to take showers more frequently... not just so I don&#39;t smell as often, but so I can get more ideas.

im using my phone while watching this , f me

Its like Jesee Pinkman from Breaking Bad is giving a TED talk 😂❤

Focus decrease because overstimulation not distraction!

Emailing qnd texting while watching this.

Using our phones.....is rewiring our brains and how we function. I need to reset myself.

<a href="">0:34</a>

I can&#39;t avoid social media because I need it for my online business and Network. All I can do is to lessen and balance using social media, I also watch YouTube videos a lot as a learning material for my IT Career.

I unistalling instagram and we stop using it  for 1 month Its my challenge ...I m writing this comment as commitment Wish me luck 😊

was studying, lost focus when this popped up, now im focusing on how to focus, guess i really need it.

They didn't put a Turkish translation but put an Arabic translation, it's really yours.
Great speaker. Good ideas and routines for a more focues and clear mind.

Thanks Chris 🙏❣️
oh my god 😮Thank you 🙏
I don&#39;t even have focus to watch this video fully

Good man

My social media is youtube

Encouraging me have a far journey

Good motivation

Thank you from the bottom of my heart
I’m going to try to find a place to think in my apartment complex this week

Amazing video frl
Very wise lecture - Thank you :)

Such an incredible speech that can help me to through this hardphase of self blaming just because i couldnt focus doing my job at all.

note:&quot;OVERSTIMULATION IS THE ENEMY OF FOCUS&quot;

I was knitting while watching this video! 😂

Thanks

I get most of my best ideas when driving

Thank you

When i watch this video, my mind crave distraction on Advertisment.

I can&#39;t focus on this video 😅

Waste of time

i reckon that most of people may watch the contents of TEDx Talks to boost their english skills

This is insightful

I got distracted while watching the video. Started to think about hurtful things that happened to me today. I can&#39;t concentrate at all If anything bad happens to me ,be it  work or my friends, i can&#39;t focus on anything.

Good  afternoon  your Steve  Right Time Today 1,00  Pm  my Name LABANYA

boredom

kinda funny to do a 15 minute video, with just a guy talking abt focus, bc exactly those people, who would need this advise, will probably only watch 2 minutes of it

I have been feeling so defeated with my distracted behavior I need a detox bad.

This was so good! Thank you for sharing about this!

The author of hyper focus 💥💥

You can&#39;t even complete the full video without scorlling through comment section.

Worth watching. Thanks buddy

he sure knows how to speak AND convince👏🏼

Is there a translate for turkish people

Just focus

this video is useful. and this video is created w/o music,not to get our mind stimulated ?

so are u saying that wandering makes us more focused?

We as humans live and learn from our past. To make better choices in the present. To create a better future for growth and success!

Fantastic
I like to keep this video in windowed mode on my phone so I can also google stuff while I watch something on my tablet as well.

I was able to switch my focus off facebook but somehow its mostly on utube now. Same distraction same pain afterwards!

How addicted people are getting to the internet and social media really makes me scared for future generations. We already see kids as young as 2 getting I pads. its gonna kill creativity and childhoods, make us more introverted and more lazy.

I couldn’t focus on this video…. What must I DO?

Great sir
💫 &quot;State of our attention determines the state of our lifes&quot;.

I lost my focus while watching this😪

Apple enters the chat….

brilliant

I was distracted by this video 🥲help

At <a href="">10:23</a>, my mind wandered to,  &quot;What is it thinking about the other 12% of the time?&quot;  I just finished a Ted Talk where the speaker said we suffer from anxiety bc our minds wander up to 80% of the time.  I&#39;ma let this all stew 😁

is he irish?

on man. that intro (screen stacking) harkens back to the movie &quot;the box&quot;. We live in a box, go to work in a box/ car... and eventually get buried in a box :/It hits home.

i get distracted while wathcing this lol

did someone tried it and it works?

Thankuuu.... chris bailey I agree with you one of biggest problem face many people of the distraction ... the main root cause , lot of tym is using social media in  a day ..... this is my habit  bt a few months ago  i chaged this habit because i face many problems due to social media then i decided to immediately uninstalled and foucs on my study unfortunetly i see excellent result

I am in love with his speech omg🫰🏻 That was really good, I will definitely try to have this “digital detox”

me coming to this video and its half way through lol

Fifa?
does anyone have any suggestions for apps that help limit ones time on things like social media?

technology sabbath lmao
&quot;May I know his name &quot;?

It takes effort i guess
We thank you for the useful information to learn to focus, but at the same time give some advice to the speaker and to the people who watch this video so that they learn not to make certain mistakes when speaking in public:

1) The use of both hands when speaking in public [And not just one]

important to help reinforce the message, emphasize key points and increase the persuasiveness of the speech.

2) avoiding drooping arms and sudden movements can contribute to projecting an image of confidence and self-assurance.

3) A hunched posture can project insecurity and lack of confidence, while an upright and relaxed posture can help project an image of authority and confidence. [please stand tall and don&#39;t keep your arms down]Tips that I learned in public speaking and that enrich our presentations.

damn you took 16 minutes of my 30

Landed here on my laptop because due to power breakdown I couldn&#39;t charge my phone. SO YEAH I SECOND.

Yes Sir! Thank you for the confirmation. Now I know when my mind wander is a productive thing. And yes to the anti hustler 😍 now I know I&#39;m doing something good for myself 🙃

Whoaa like those advice. Thank you sir✨️
Thanks a million for the video . God Bless You Amen

Conclusion: don&#39;t be on your phone, be in the present, specifically; focus on what you&#39;re doing.

Really such a greatest ted talk on focus and like one quote distraction is not the enemy to focus overstimulating is the enemy to focus

As ur talking...I get distracted thinking abt smthx that is to happen tmrrw

The technology is not the problem . We  are use it without any control . All extremes are very bad for the human been .   I am very sad about this generation.  (I am 60 y/o. ) their brain is going to collapse because they use all of these devices 24 /7 .

The audience was quiet this time, seems like they were very focused.

phone is cancer

i am 22. i wish i knew this at 15

Make love

deep ideas

awesome

For years I (half) joke with friends how much I love standing in lines. I love being at the store and waiting, because I get some of my best thinking done. People talk about how fast time goes by, but I do love to think about how much it can slow down when waiting. I have subscribed for a very long time to the art of &quot;blankly staring off into space&quot; because I know how good it is for my brain. It can be hard (especially because my work is socializing and online and keeping up with all the things all the time) but it&#39;s so very important. Especially as a creative who has to come up with content. Gotta let that brain simmer to get stuff done! Nice Ted Talk Mr. Bailey.

i throw my iphone 14. out of my condo so far

I can’t focus on the video for more than 8 seconds

Dad&#39;s that sit in the car understand what he&#39;s saying

He simply described how the geniuses of all the time made the best discoveries of the humankind:“I think 99 times and find nothing. I stop thinking, swim in silence, and the truth comes to me.” - Albert Einstein

Wondering if this is why meditation helps you stay focused.

If I wasn&#39;t looking at the screen I&#39;d thought this was mrbeast

Thanks for sharing

You see , Do you know what is the most common thing between you and I  ? Reading comments without foucsing on any video we watch

focus will led to success

This &#39;scatter focus&#39; is also called defuse thinking, and is explained very well in the book &#39;A mind for numbers&#39; by Barbara Oakley. Very interesting!

I can&#39;t even focus this video! I&#39;m reading comments....

i opened that vedio  because the guy is cute :)

This is amazing, I have been considering some of these things myself and this was the icing on the cake, going to try to follow Chris Bailey where I can find him, a genius of communication and common sense, sharing it with everyone - loved every moment - had to re-watch it as I was texting while watching the first time - whoops, work in progress. Julie :)

I am student 🇸🇴 1m like 👍😎
Learn how to control notifications. They are like weeds.

What&#39;s the reference for it taking 8 days to adjust to lower stimulation?

Your mom telling you your phone is ruining everything about your life is true all along

This is good.

I commented after the video. Wow speechless. His mind helped my mind lmao

Thank you soo much

<a href="">13:08</a> this is prolly my favorite thing from this video, it really helps me so much to understand what i should do to extend my attention span! thanks for this great video

Have to say, This Works. Like seriously. Can&#39;t listen? Don&#39;t have time? Reduce screen time and social media time. It works. It did for me

I have inattentive ADHD and grew up before screens. Even back then I could not bring myself to consistently focus on or finish activities like painting, puzzles, board games or reading. My mind would keep zoning in and out in class, in the play ground and basically everywhere and anywhere. Hardly think screen time detoxes are going to fix that.

Just when you think you’re focused an ad pops up

i think his is the book __hyperfocus.   all about it...

Here i m finding my focus 😶
I think mediation is a way to make mind less stimulate

i lost focus 20-30 times while watching this video xD

Great ideas thank you

In short: Reduce hyper stimulation and let your mind wander

❤❤❤ true true true I saw twice 😊
That&#39;s useful for me. prefect🥰🥰
I&#39;m finally focused enough to watch this video after years, and as soon as it started,  I realized it&#39;s just another distraction.

&quot;Overstimulation is the enemy of focus&quot; It is so bad that we waste so much of our time spending hours on social media or Youtube or any other high stimulant . It feels so empowering that we forget time is the most valuable asset we have got but it&#39;s only at the end we realize when it&#39;s gone .

What an amazing video

God, I hope this works.

There are so many things wrong with this talk, I wonder why everybody agrees just because this guy blames the usual suspect - phone. Some people nowadays are lonely, they stay home whole day working from home, their only socializing opportunity is internet. People learn things like languages, that require constant repetition, multiple reminders during the day to repeat words, that’s another distraction. People have ADD/ADHD and other problems, they cannot stay focus no matter what, phone helps them to get enough stimulation, instead of suffering. But I agree that in general there is a problem, I don’t agree with the solution.

But… how do I get my brain to focus on the video long enough to learn how to get my brain to focus?

Thank you you have validated my research as well I am on my journey

Core thought of video is put aside everything that distract you like phone, laptop, computer,tv, and so on..It will not increase your focus it will ease you in focusing.Thankse later

What about if I done something terrible in the past?

Tedx Talks which is one of the ways to learn another language, appreciate much from topic above

This isn’t realistic for neurodivergent people. Just saying, one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to how the brain functions.Also, this is purely anecdotal for him and only him. There is some interesting things to take away from this but it’s not life changing for everyone.

thank you

when u r trying to stay fully focused and then the adv. plays the demon mind on you

Get your brain space and just stay calm, thank you so much

I noticed the phone was taking people away from paying attention to important things, before it hit me too. I fight with myself not to grab it. Not to post and not to read. I have more than enough to keep myself busy without it. Now, i start with I will not post before I grab the phone. Sometimes it works.

My atention span is so good that during the first three minutes of this video I was playing Candy Crush Saga,then finished all lives, I checked facebook on my smartphone. But thanks to the quality content of this video I restrained from using my smartphone for the next 11 minutes. Thank you so much.

Caption is good but needs to update another how to collapse focus , interruption , harassment bullying , in&#39;t

totally agree and that&#39;s what I like doing , while all people even when they walk they would put ear pods but for me I would love to be present

it is a great video but for any normal  viewer we might try to get less distracted for 2 or 3 days but after that we cant life without distractions , it is however very true but its practically impossible especially for the gen z.

It doesnt work for whose broken hearted

Honest to God, this was really thought provoking.

How many time were you distracted watching this ? 4 times for me :)

Stop reading comments and focus in the video.... your life will be miserable if you&#39;re distracted...stay focused

I feel so useless just because I can&#39;t control my mobile addiction and can&#39;t focus on studies. I feel like I can&#39;t do it anymore, I can&#39;t accomplish anything. I&#39;ve exams in 30 days and I can&#39;t do preparation. When everyone else is studying 10 to 12 hours a day, I&#39;m extremely sad and cry so much after every 2 to 3 days.

Thank you so much sir 💐
But focus on social media is also a kind of focus

To anyone that reads this, make certain before you go to SLEEP. Plan what you will do tomorrow, this allowed me to structure my decisions, making less and less unnecessary distractions

the really hard thing to do was to search for the video and face that fact that its hard to concentrate nowdays

it&#39;s a relly a great episode <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/1v50XorRJ8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a>

TLDR

Take your time guys.

I really enjoyed listening to this

that background sound is driving me insane

phone doesn&#39;t interrupt me. I want to control my mind to focus on what i am doing and not let it be thinking anything else during that particular point of time.

👌WOW
This was a wonderful talk! Thanks Chris Bailey! :)

Those who want to really learn how to focus stop wasting time watching YouTube

He&#39;s such a GREAT speaker !!!

My issue here is ironically the opposite. I have plenty of ideas every day, and i have plans.<b>my problem is i like the focus to act upon them consistently</b>

Thank you very much. I will definitely use my devices less.

@<a href="">08:35</a> It always happens in the shower.... doesn&#39;t it?😄

You’d be watching a well informative video like this, super focused then BooooooM a YouTube ad would come and distract your focus😅

After spending 3 hours on phone, i am watching this video, and the fun fact is that i am watching it on the phone.

conclusion and my learning: 1: we need space like traffic needs to move on . the space between cars2: overstimulation is the enemy of focus not distractions 3: remove screens from life or limit screen time, experience boredom and let the ideas come into your brain4: read books instead we think we can learn more from YT and other learning apps but its actually written in books5: as we go from one room to another we experience change of ideas , so we can make our environment less distracting 6: remove phone from learning area or get chunk of dopamine distraction nugget after 40 mins cuz our brain  crave for distractions

it is clear that my mobile phone use explains my decline in study patterns. less productiveness = more phone time. what a great video thank you☺️

To translate it in a more blunt way: basically he blames us for our depression.. Crazy idea I know 😅.

I just needed to cure my ADHD. :)

I&#39;ve distracted for 12 minutes on this 15 minute video. Still i didn&#39;t figure out how to focus. Help me

8 daysNot all those who wander are lostMinds perspective bias

If you want to define what is a distraction you need to define what exactly is it that is important, which you cannot, can you?

Your watching the video while doing work😂😂😂

If you are watching this video and reading the comments at same time. There is your problem. You need to FOCUS!!

Focus is very important

Summary: reduce your cell phone consumption, we spend thinking about our future
Đg
Hey uh buddy. Pretty ironic you’re in the comment section. How about you focus on the video teaching you how to focus.

I am also suffering from type of situation

I got distracted twice while watching this video🤐

YouTube keeps showing us distractive ads while watching this video

What&#39; a fresh and fascinating prespective:  Overstimulation is the enemy of the focus.  The state of our attention is what determines the state of our mind.

I read his book named Hyper Focus at the beginning of the year. It is an excellent book and watching this talk is a great way to review the book&#39;s content. Thanks so much!

i cant even focus on this video T^T

Researchers did a experiment where they place an electrode in a mans hypothalamus and whenever the man pressed the button, a burst of dopamine would be induced. When the experiment was over they asked what the man felt. He said &quot;I did not receive pleasure every time I pressed it. When I pressed it, it was like the word I was thinking of on the tip of my tongue was getting closer and closer but never came&quot;.Dopamine is actually not the pleasure hormone. It is more linked to motivation. We get a burst of dopamine when we are ordering the pizza. Gamblers get a spike of dopamine when they place the bet, not when they win. I was blown away when I learn about this. Such a good point to bring especially in the tech world we live in today. Gotta try being bored!

All of this and still nothing productive 😂

Thank u, thank u🥺😭😭😭
oh gosh, i needed this lecture long time ago. it was so usefull, thank u very much

How can we focus on this video if the person  talking in the video is handsome !

as i play this video and tab to a twitch streamer for background listen 😅

Thanks for all of this

I WISH I COULD FIND TIME TO BE BORED😓😓😓😓😓

Brilliant knock!

I am trying to complete my dissertation and I have realized how much the &quot;overstimulation&quot; of my brain throughout the day is blocking the flow of ideas and my ability to concentrate. This was very helpful. I&#39;m going to focus on spending less time on my phone.

I really recommend this video as the ultimate &quot;HOW TO FOCUS&quot;. I have visited different videos regarding the topic of focus and read few books.  Other sources have gone too far by mentioning the breathing, walking, eating, regulation which all are effects of maintaining distractions. And this video is all about focus and distractions.

distracting myself by watching this ted talk T___T

Me: Watching on 2X Speed while working on my laptop for work and juggling between this video and the tiktok that told me I should watch it.

This reminds me of a beautiful song, and it&#39;s of my favorites . It&#39;s called &quot;Look on up - Relient K&quot;. give it a chance and go listen, you&#39;ll thank me later :D

The ads broke my focus

My focus is so bad, I couldn’t even finish the video before scrolling to the next videos and looking at the comments. I needed this video!

I think i wander my focus and thoughts in rangePast 47% (regreting guilt of past)Present 2% Future 51% (concerned future , imagining future thoughts)

To make IT short-just off wifi

I loved it !

Such a great talk - thanks for sharing!

One of the excellent speeches on Tx .... 👍

thank you for the knowledge, may your life always be made easier by God, and when you get into trouble, God will guide you to find a way out.

<b>*watches in 2x speed*</b>

This Is love me again thank YouTube video editor un

I have a problem where my brain wanders so much that I forget what I’m doing. Is there something wrong that I’m doing?

watching this video now as it distracting me from studying

Thank you for such a great talk! However, I’m wondering, if we let our mind wander in every simple task, basically every small moment throughout the day, will it be overwhelmed, because of too much thoughts on our mind? How to balance this with mindfulness?

Thank you

Now i just need to focus on this video

I needed that..i needed that right now

Inspirational

Incredibly powerful and useful suggestions! Can&#39;t thank you enough for giving this out at the right time. I have been struggling to find the reason for my lack of concentration while studying.  I think it is this overstimulation to devices that is killing my creativity, affecting my concentration levels. I will definitely try out this disconnection ritual from today!

My mind wanders and get the best ideas sometimes when I take a very shallow nap so it&#39;s impossible to take notes. Sometimes it lingers in my mind for a few hours within the day. Most of them are musical melodies that I have never heard of.

Haha Fatima 😂😂
Anyone have any activity ideas like how he does knitting?

He is not British

Ironically watching this whilst working cause I wanted to feel more productive haha

We are starting this today!

Hello from Azerbaijan🇦🇿This is interesting video for us.Thanks, TED&#39;x Talk ✌️

I&#39;ve had social media uninstalled for about 3 months. You truly are able to achieve a peace of mind and a stronger self awareness. I feel that today&#39;s social media creates a constant feeling of missing out which will drag on throughout some people&#39;s days and make them believe their life as boring. But truly you are only missing out on life if you are held in a state kf believe that you are missing out.

Very useful video❤️
and yet i learned about it on my phone :)

If some one give like I will study every hour based on like I received In day 😂 like ,one like one hour .

52 books in a year

52 book

When the 3 am motivation hits

Ok, convinced this s last video for today

I watched this a month ago, then bought a book called hyperfocus, and I wanted to know who this guy is by hopping into youtube and shocked when I found out it was this guy.

Saia

Not who wander are lost. Our mind thinks about the future more than the total addition of the past and future.

It&#39;s really really helpful. Thanks a lot 😊

Who else is procrastinating there homework by watching this

This guy : disconnect and see where your mind goes My brain : so now that you finally let me talk again how do you want to kill yourself

The video is very useful!Every time I always think about this, why can&#39;t I focus on something? This video provides a very detailed explanation. The speaker suggested that the reason we can&#39;t focus on it is not because of distraction, but because of overstimulation. One of the things that can create overstimulation is the gadget. Almost 80% of our lives are covered by gadgets. And this turns out to make our minds unfocused.Put down your device, and wait for your focus to increase. I highly recommend this video.

Thank you brother for this video. I was very happy to change your thinking that you are right

I have problems focus to learn ,the most part of the distraction is social network

These kind of life lessons should be taught in Schools so that we can have a better life.

thank you

When I first watched this vedio I didn&#39;t knew who he was, so I watched this very casually then after sometime I found he had written a book Hyperfocus which I read recently, and I came back to this vedio with immense respect.

That was amazing. In addition, thanks Tedx

Awesome Ted talk.

I love this. Took a break from facebook and allowed myself 3 checkups on LinkedIn as I am searching for a job. I deleted all games from my phone. A month and a half and I feel nothing is missing from my life.

In the past, we had ignorance as main issue and right now we have distraction taking place.

Who else lost their focus ALOT of times watching this?

Brilliant❤️❤️❤️
i couldnt finish the video because i cannot focus...

Not all those who wander are lost

This is a great video!

This  is the most valuable thing that I&#39;ve learned this month!Thanks a lot to the speaker🖤

its extraordinary....
Hey, you&#39;re great.

Thankyou

Thanks for the knowledge

Ok, but all the ideas I get is when I am over stimulated. Like when I have to prepare for multiple exams and I am super busy, I suddenly get overcreative getting ideas about a painting i absolutely want to do, or suddenly I want to start a business or a project or learn new things all together. And pointedly when I end my exams and finally have time to properly do such things I slack back and all of these ideas disappear, even if I try to search for them they don&#39;t seem to get to me. This tortures me everyday.

Mind wondering goes to dark places when you&#39;re depressed.Speaking from experience

I am the only one who does&#39;nt watched the video till end due to lack of focus

Coming from his book, Hyperfocus. It has changed the way i have always thought of focusing. This ted talk is a summary of his book. Exceptional research. I am thankful to him as a student.

Thank you @Anablanchu 💖Ana Blanca 💐
Today I&#39;ve finished his book called &quot;The productivity project&quot;

I literally zoned out 3 times while watching this video.I need help

Thank you for finally explaining traffic to me. I never understood it

Peace is freeeee and freeeeedom is clear 😁

Let your mind wander (not in electronic distractions) Do 1hr of boring stuff dailyAdjust your mind to lower stimuli levelGradually increase the time of focus hours

This is what i experienced couple of years ago when i quit using my fon.

I&#39;ve been distracted maybe 100 times during this video 😂 thank you for this golden nugget of info.

That&#39;s a wonderful opportunity of learning and motivation especially in this trending phase of the influence of technology in our lives😇 Thankyou so much🙏😊

Fine!

i can&#39;t even focus to watch this video

Who are here watching abhi n niyu shorts?

I got distracted by YouTube ads

hounsty u r a rare  thanks alot

This is a lecture. It is really what my mind need  at this point in my life.Thank you TEDX and Chris Bailey.

Get rid of distractions and stimulations. This will make my brain be bored and will start to wander then will get many good ideas. &quot;applying simplicity and boredom will help develop clear and improving focus. Distractions are not the enemy of focus, but part of focus.Thank you a million.

Meditation could be useful to achieve that...

I love Lord Jesus. He is my saviour. When I was 7, my family and I went on a vacation and I didn&#39;t know the swimming pool is deep, then I jumped into the swimming pool. When I realised the water is deep, I was struggling and in fear. Then God came. A stranger was sent by God and saved me. He carried me up the pool. I thanked the man for saving me. My parents were taking photos there and did not notice that I was in trouble. I am grateful that God turned me into such a lovely person. Jesus Christ, we love you because you first loved us! God bless you!

Took me about 3 minutes to guess that this dude is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The second he mentioned a &quot;technology Sabbath&quot; towards the end, that basically confirmed it for me.

Worth listening 👂
i didnt catch the first 6 minutes lmao

He speaks so clearly. I really enjoyed this talk.

I wish I had known this 20 years ago before beginning by formal education journey.

thank you its super idea!

Play on 1.5x and also improve your focus keeping up Thanks me later

Real clean 🧼
Read Anna Lembke&#39;s book on dopamine - the biological basis of this topic.

I think focus is related to your love for the thing your doing. How come i can spend hours playing games and focusing but can&#39;t read a book for 5 minutes. It&#39;s because i like one and hate the other. My mother used to tell me when i was little, &quot;love the tough subjects, love the school, don&#39;t hate it&quot;. I guess now i know why.

Great speech, however, adverts distracted me. 😅
Love these talks their so educational

It&#39;s amazing to think when our minds wander almost half of our thoughts are to do with the future.

A lecture which I wanted.

I can guarantee that most of you guys are procrastinating right now

ty sm

i cant believe i watched this for 15 mins straight without realizing it. its so good.

I knit or crochet to relax my brain after work every day. Or whenever I&#39;m stressed. In fact I&#39;m crocheting as I watch this. 😄

I needed this to become eleven in stranger things 😂

Thats a very stimulating talk on how to less stimulate your mind. Will try the same

Thank you so much 🙏❤😃
Mmmm idk I dnt feel anyway about getting on social media

Utube has to have a steady level of audio in videos and advertisememts. The audio in this video is too low and when you increase the volume to high suddenly the advertisememts starts on high volume. So sad this is the plight of utube.

Needed this......

I spent 15.56 minutes for this video and now I have 14.04 minutes

me watching this on my phone as a distraction from work: 👁👄👁

It&#39;s good to spend weekends or days without social media. This is the real detox.

Then there&#39;s me watching this to help my boredom at work while also texting people on my phone😂

i cant even focus to watch this video

let your mind wander. and how can we achieve that? by being bored.

&quot;The state of our attention is what determines the state of lives&quot;—this phrase has really resonated with me on a deep level.The video has taught me that the main reasons of our issues with concentration are overstimulation and lack of space between activities. Sometimes, you have to not be afraid to be bored instead of entertaining yourself with artificial dopamine hits like social media. Putting aside our phones for a day or a week will increase our productivity and improve our concentration immensely.

Lord Buddha taught how to concentrate very well 🙏

Good

Ok😁😁😁
I came back from somewhere my head had gone to find that the guy had been speaking for over two minutes! 🤣Apparently, this is going to be a hard lesson for me to learn.

I have noticed that this focus occurs while building lego.

People who incessantly listen to music...and possibly not the best music...is a major distraction also for the brain.  Quality and quantity ratio in music is key.

Amazing video
not all who wander are lost
People, please unleash Your GigaChad

Completely amazing grateful for the research involved

I have this problem of intentionally distracting my mind bcz I don&#39;t stop thinking negatively, either about past, present or future :) but I want to work on this

I got distracted along the way to read the comments

Me watching this while I&#39;m waiting to finish the update of my game...

Over stimulation is the reason most people of this generation don&#39;t have a logical goal in their life.

Our smartphones!! Nobody is realizing it but the smartphone has been killing our attention with a everyday task, let&#39;s say we are either washing dishes and listening to music or taking shower listening to music or seeking answers for something and all of suddenly we are in instagram, YouTube, Facebook...It&#39;s clear our attention has been trained to be focus in various ways and not only what we want! It&#39;s different to do a lot of things in a smartphone and to do a lot of things being a farmer...Being a farmer doesn&#39;t give you opportunity to switch all of suddenly your task you are doing at the moment...This smartphone has cluttered our mind 😔

Youtube ads between this TedTalk distracted me so I closed the window midway..

This videos is really really good educative eye opening

There is a book and a free course on Coursera called &quot;Learning How to Learn&quot; that goes over a few of these topics in more depth. The focused and diffused state.

ok

One of the many great corruptions of capitalism is the over-glorification of &quot;busy.&quot;

He&#39;s right. We need more space to have more idea and fun with boredom

This is why people get great results from meditation

Watched.

Distractions are rife when you work from home too. Fantastic tips here

ok, now I need to focus for 16 minutes.

How your focus ?

I like the video, very interesting and understandable
Say: &quot;O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.&quot; If then they turn back, say ye: &quot;Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah&#39;s Will).

Wow

focus is muscle. the more you use it, the stronger it gets.

I always love TED. Meetings becuse they make a person positive and a successful person in this life thank you very much for the wonderful success!!!!

I have someone for that job...

too bad I don&#39;t have the required attention span to watch this

I find it ironic that I am distracting myself with a video about how to focus.

Just talk about achievement buy one search someone if they want to read it Now or read it later about it 2million dollars for a book I just need because about it someone did read a book achievement but If you could achieve it you could  find my one day book how I want to achieve buying 2million book because everyday  one need to find one about it  but I’m not sure about what i just told you about it so 3 reason why I’m saying 2million everyday change my life

I know I can&#39;t focus because as I am trying to listen to him, I have been scrolling through comments, looking at the recommended videos on the side, opened 2 new tabs, and now I am writing this comment.... I need help 😅

not a good talk on focus. Bad presentation skills too. Too many irrelevant stuff in it, e.g. cute cat, etc

:(:

Even right now facing too much difficulty to focus on his video.

This TED Talk was fantastic. Lately, I feel like we try to do so much for our business, work, etc that it does just become a overwhelming distraction. I have to use my cell phone for clients, marketing, social media, etc so it will be interesting to see if Chris wrote something for sales professionals as I am a realtor that feels like I live and die by the cell phone. I am going to try and implement his 2-week challenge.

Great 😎👍🏻 dude
One of the best videos I have ever seen that clearly explains why we get distracted or how to regain that attention and focus. Thank you Chris

getting bored is the best way to concentrate 😄

I got distracted by my phone while watching this.

I’m overwhelmed always and can’t keep focusing for long time without being distracted with my phone, that make to forget quickly and not even paying attention when people speak to me. This video explains concisely what I’m suffering from.

Thanks a lot for sharing this awesome video with us all.

Ha! Five minutes into watching and focusing on this talk - the video paused and an ad broke  in!! Can&#39;t even watch a talk on how to get your brain to focus without technology distracting us!

Thank you, Chris Bailey, wonderful presentation 😄🙏🏽
Thank you so much for this video.

I wich heard this two weeks ago my brain is overstimulated I can&#39;t focus I blamed myself for not studying and working and the bac exam approaches. I am sorry for myself. I hearted myself just to study more and more and more even if I was exhausted. the days of exam came and I felt extremely tired. i couldn&#39;t focus on my test I felt like the hole efforts I made along the year are lost for just waiting more and being stressed. may god help me to pass through this :( and have a good grade and  so good opportunities to choose a university and a domain that I can fit it and love &lt;3

It really is that dang phone thank you mom

There are some many things that counters most of this, but jt pointless to say it here

I tried not watching YouTube or audiobooks for a week or two except for Weekends, because I’m basically always listening to them when I’m getting ready in the morning. I guess my mind was a little more calm, but I really didn’t notice too much of a productivity difference. Except maybe that I was less likely to procrastinate. Did I do it wrong?

Why is he standing on Japan

i love his bdy language, how he keeps moving and how his voice changes based on the speech. I can see how much he is interested in sharing this...

Wow, I&#39;m actually really proud of myself for watching this through from beginning to end without looking at my phone or going to another browser.  This was good, really good. thank you. I will certainly look to implement the aspects mentioned in the video.

U can say that 30min for everyday is phone needed but even to watch this video i spent 20 min

you talk too slow
so helpful

doesn&#39;t he sound kinda like Sheldon Cooper?

So I see the point of this as not getting too stimulated, which is the root of all distraction that might come around you, specielly when you&#39;re on the internet, when you have plenty of different things to look upon, and it ends up drafting you away from all the good ideas of which you could&#39;ve come across with whilst you were bored. Letting it &#39;flow&#39;, basically. Hence, boredom isn&#39;t that bad, after all. Generation Z going absolutely mental after this lol

Beautiful indeed 👍👍
how can l get my brain focus if l can&#39;t focus watching this video?

The way he hit the spot with the start, I literally stared at my non existent camera.

Who like this video then like my commentWho like Ted talks then comment me

When i wanted to focuscovid 19- hol &#39;up lemme introduce you to lockdown

Good for Chris Bailey.  I liked his wisdom on how the mind can connect with more inspiring and/or novel ideas when given the room to &quot;wander&quot;.  That said, I strongly disagree with his criticism of your phone.  Perhaps this is because I have come across numerous articles and &quot;pseudo life hacks&quot; that discourage phone use and that I don&#39;t have an obsessive time-consuming relationship with my mobile phone.  But I didn&#39;t have a phone recently for a span of a few days because my previous one died and I hadn&#39;t set up the new one and my confidence, security, and safety plummetted.  When I got the new phone I could navigate with the gps and maps, make important support phone calls to family and friends and even medical support, and you are factually more connected with the presence of a phone.  I understand how some people are way overstimulated, registering Facebook-like-dopamine-shots constantly, and decreasing the phone presence could be an asset to them (I deleted my Facebook account completely permanently last year).  But my main message is a phone doesn&#39;t have to a be a distraction, it can increase your connectivity and even safety and security!

I can’t even focus on this video

Master piece 🙌

12M people are trying to get their brains to get focus. INTERESTING!! ;)

thanky a lot for this good and interesting talk

Huh? I have a problem with focus. I sit down to work on a book, and my mind wanders off--not to the past, not the future, not in the present, but to some fantasy outside of time. (For the last four days, it&#39;s been running off to variations on the SAME scenario, demanding I re-edit and re-edit what I wrote about it, which has nothing to do with any of the writing projects I&#39;m trying to finish. In fact, even as I type this, my mind is creating new revisions of it, instead of clearing out my emails, searching for references on some of my non-fiction books, or even writing possible scenes in my current fiction work. )And I don&#39;t even have a cell phone--or home internet access.

Like a thinking hour or meditation

Accept The Challenges! Let&#39;s do it!

The main thing that I learned out of this Ted talk is that a calm mind is a strong mind. This Ted talk is kind of a watershed moment for those who really understood the message.

It was really usefuli like it i learn more about focusing actually  it is reallybsignifican to me focus on my studu becouse i need enter the university.Although i try, my phone distroy my focus 😐ok thanks for speech

Thanks for your help sir

Who has read his book? Do you recommend it? I need help with focus and procrastination (((

sorry i get distracted by my phone

The thing he said about knitting is actually funny. Back when one of my chores was milking a goat with a mechanical milker instead of my hands,, I got really bored. And then I got the best ideas when waiting for the milking to be over. I had to remind myself to bring a notebook and pen because the ideas were so good., it&#39;s really insightful to hear this guy talk about something I&#39;ve experienced and explain the benefits of it

I&#39;m totally going to try this challenge but I have a question and I&#39;m not being funny but when I disconnect for about 2 hours a day can I smoke a blunt while I let my mind roam oh is that a bad idea? Serious answers only

Excellent
Thank you

Anyone else needed effort to watch the entire thing in one go? Lol

After watching this video I changed my screen time settings to 30 min in a day but it&#39;s not working for me... :(

Thank you very much

I must Iike to be angry, disappointed and triggered... cuz thats all these apps do when I open them.

great talk
The talk was great the jumping not so much...that was distracting until I just listened.

And a question to answer

A poem to hear

I left a letter to read

How to get your brain to focus? Don’t watch YouTube, don’t use Facebook and delete twitter

Those 5.3k dislikes are from people who were holding the phone upside down ;)

I watched it while using my phone, am I that distracted?

Such a informative video.. Looking forward for more such great videos 🙏🏻✨

after watching this, I think I need a break from the digital world but I&#39;m not sure if I can😭

&quot;Overstimulation is the enemy of focus&quot;💯👍

This is an awesome Ted Talks to show high school students!!!

I watched this at twice the speed just so my attention could make it to the end

thanks💘

What about medicine students? We are 1000% stimulated and we NEED to study, please, how we can get through distraction

I am a person easily distracts in concentrating so sometimes tasks are not informing

Me watching this while eating 🥴

millenials..haha...idiocrazy is what is coming

More I like how he speaks slowly clearly and simply and more I like the topic so the battery is low now🙃🙃 . I hope I can hhhh so I&#39;m backing now to rewatch this stronger speech 🎆💕 THANK YOU MR for sharing this incredible ideas 🥀❤

yeah ! it&#39;s an amazing lecture, i find it so benifit and helpful for me really if we want to stimulate our brains capacity and focus we just need to change our mind and our behaviors! It will be difficult at first but we will gradually get used to it after that

WOW AMAZING

My head is overstimulated most of the time it&#39;s like a disease. I don&#39;t know what thoughts to follow anymore

Thank you so much

My language improved when I started watching TED videos
Focuse on him not on comments

I experienced this before watching this video. I still remember that when I was in grade 10, I often spent time on my phone chatting with my ex-boyfriend. After that, we broke up and I tried to find many ways to focus more on myself and I realized that I need to improve my academic performance this next semester. Random thoughts came across my mind that I decided to let my mom to keep my phone. I decided not to use my phone for the last 2 years in my high school and that decision totally changed my life. I know, it was quite inconvenient as no one could contact me directly via calling by phone but I acquired many great values at that moment. Instead of waking up and checking up my phone, I did my daily activities immediately and spent most of my time studying. I still used computer that I could communicate with other people via social media but you guys know that we cannot bring computers everywhere with us and open it anytime, so I could cut down a large amount of time on using technological devices. Similarly, I also end up my day with going to bed immediately instead of spending hours surfing social medias. Trust me, it worked and I used to be a student who just ranked 18th in my class in grade 10, but gradually, I ranked top 2 in grade 11 and became the best student of MY SCHOOL with the highest GPA, not my class anymore in grade 12. And now, after 2 years, I feel overwhelming one more time and I know, it&#39;s time for me to leave my phone behind, AGAIN!

I agree to what you are trying to say but I have a doubt whether you have raised a fundermental question of life: what is life after the huge success made through the fucusing onto any subject other than life itself...

my friend, I want to ask you if I take your video and dubbing it to the Arabic language and post it in my YouTube channel, are you eccept this or not, and is that legal?

Thq so much to you 😇

How is my level: No social media ✅ No WhatsApp ✅ Weekend without cell phone ✅
This is what I need. An actual logical and fun thing to listen, not getting slammed by my parents whenever she&#39;s nagging at me when I even touch phone for 0.00000001 seconds

It was great ty❤️

This video helps me a lot and I shared this to my teacher itself, as it&#39;s so amazing and this helps me so much.My key learnings:- Don&#39;t spend a lot of time on the computer, delete social media.- Have a day without your phone.- Don&#39;t use your phone every morning (even though I don&#39;t have a phone).- Try to limit your use of screen time for 3 hours (I usually use for 12 - 18 hours and I&#39;m using in order to make sure that I&#39;m doing it rightfully).- Make a lot of research which can give great results (I&#39;m really thinking of this, but I don&#39;t know how).- Do your homework.- Take action.That&#39;s it for now.

Realizing how many times I got distracted just trying to watch this... Much needed and thank you TEDx this will hopefully help me in big ways.

blablabalblablablablablablablablablawhat ever

This man wrote a book i read named Hyperfocus. I recommend everyone to read that book, helps so much since im a student

Great explanation. 💯💯💯🙏🙏🇮🇳
In case you missed it comepletly he is asking us to meditate.

So nice of you

I watched this on my phone

I purposefully distract myself at times because I cannot bear my own thoughts. Depression is like a ghost watching me from the corner.

Hahhaha i was knitting while I was listening this

Howdy NCLEers, and yes, I am sending this from my computer!

Been able to listen to <a href="">14:20</a> minutes, and hey, deleting Tik Tok was a good thing, yeah I miss it, it&#39;s been like 36h of tik tok detox.

It's really hard to understand, oh my god, huee
I&#39;m gonna ignore my phone for 1 week now

i will challenge myself for two weeks , i gonna to disconnect from the internet completely from 8PM to 8:30AM, in addition to that , i will write a plane to spend this two weeks in what benefit me without wist my time

Here’s to everyone watching this instead of doing their research papers

me knitting and watching this to overstimulate my brain: 👁👄👁

What color is your shirt?
Thanks 👍🏻😊 helped me a lot......
couldnt focus on the vid ngl

Thank you so much 💞

I can even focus to finish the whole video

i have 8 seg of concentrationADHD

Boredom brought me here.

Thank you

This man has changed my life. Thank you so much!

cant believe there&#39;s an ad after 5 mins of saying &quot;why we get distracted&quot; to distract us lmao

he looks like heath ledger.

This TedTalk is nice :)) I’ll let my brain take a rest from overstimulation for 2 weeks

I hope this man enter islam , he will see and know many things he need’s , foe example the pray in the night and his effect in the brain !

What a genius!!!

I even lost focus while watching this video..lol

I saw this video and skipped to the next one after 35 seconds

Why technology is a problem for our focus, seriously I don&#39;t need my mobile to get distracted, I touch my book and get some weird thoughts and boom! I&#39;m in my own DreamWorks!

It&#39;s really useful 🥰❤️‍🔥
Thanks a ton for this most valuable information.

I got distracted every 35 sec watching this video.

could&#39;ve swear im reading a book earlier...

Ted must b doing something right. I found that I tend to hit the like button before I even watch the video. 🧠food. Luv Ted!!!

This was very helpful! 🙏🏿

I’m glad I came across this video. Recently, working from home, I’ve realized I’m not able to focus at work/meetings. I feel like my head and eyes are so heavy. I now realize all the extra screens and tablets and phones that’s around me are stimulating my mind constantly to pay attention to one thing. I’ll practice boredom for two weeks and I hope to see positive results. Thank you.

Haven&#39;t completely gone through the whole video yet, but I feel as though my brain is almost always distracted, it&#39;s so easy to forget some simple things (even if I try hard) that&#39;s why I&#39;m here in the first place. It&#39;s just in this space I feel like it&#39;s almost impossible to ease up to begin on anything, I literally feel like I can never even speak in a stable manner like I&#39;m being judged or watched constantly (well, that might be a bit true lol). But yeah, I guess mine really is an extreme case and it will take more than a couple of videos.

great

The irony is right before watching this I almost didn&#39;t watch it because two vidoes above it were only <a href="">3:00</a> instead of 15 LOL

Great

I bumped into this at the right time. Right now am making the move of taking away my phone for the next 3 hours to focus on my assignment. Focus requires deliberate actions and discipline. Overestimulating the brain is unhealthy!!

I&#39;m a CS student, in my freshman year I practiced coding a lot, and was really good at algorythm and coding excersice stuff, then in second year, I start learning about web dev, Reat, NodeJS, Express..., lots of thing to read, and did projects that had already there, which i just need to read their functionality then code. And now when I came back to algorythm, my brain became really weird, I cant focus, and being distracted alot. Hope this can help me somehow

Am so far gone, that even focusing on this video is hard. Had to go back a couple times. Thank you.

I am just distracted by reading the youtube comments instead of focusing solely on the video.

I know these things that we have to keep our mobile phones away when we have to focus....But in order implement,an expert has to say in a way that we start doing these things.

+ daily meditation! Even if it&#39;s just 10min, it&#39;ll make you feel more focused and aligned.

When I watch this through a phone

I love waiting for Godot IRL, just wait for nothing to happen.

I&#39;m truly baffled how our relationship with smart phones needed to be so thoroughly researched. Anyone over 45 has been talking about this since smart phones were invented and have received nothing but &quot;old age&quot; comments, backlash, and eyerolls. What would we know about anything, right? Minors of all ages are limited to phone and computer time (for these very reasons) by millions of parents, so why would adults be any different? Until now, never has there been a time and culture that disregards and loathes their elders, those who have lived decades longer and has the experience for foresight.

Thank you so much! I needed this &lt;3

while watching video on focus ;all adds coming and distracting you

Mad confusing. Ironically unfocused presentation.

It’s interesting that he said our mind wonders about the present and the future more than the past, and how he planned the day ahead in the shower, because it’s totally different for me. 90% of the time when I am bored/relaxed/in the shower, I just go over past events in my head, and relive all those happy or sad or awkward moments

Ironic, I’m watching this on my phone while at work…

<a href="">13:20</a> &quot;It&#39;s not the car that allows you to move fast, but It&#39;s how much space the traffic has&quot;Ok, nice. I think I&#39;ll remember this one for the rest of my life

i have so much &#39;&#39;not focus&#39;&#39; problem that even while watching this video on my pc. I start watching TikTok on my mobile

I listen to tedtalks when I&#39;m cleaning or doing something productive cuz I have adhd and I have a hard time focusing when it&#39;s quiet. I learn as I&#39;m being productive and I also always retain the Information from all the videos and apply it in my daily life. I am a totally different person than I was just 2 years ago.

My mind right now are easily distracted than before. Because of technology

1. Do your homework now, YES NOW
2. Make yourself bored for a month (by getting rid of distracting things and entertainment like cellphone)     

3. Focus on the most important things you need to do

4. Minimize/avoid distractions

Bizarrely I also have the opposite problem: my mind wanders <i>in response to</i> stimulus, so I have some of my best ideas while I&#39;m watching Youtube videos and then realize that I stopped paying attention to the video and let my mind wander into my future instead. As a programmer, sometimes I actually have to listen to loud music on headphones in order to occupy the creative part of my brain so that I can write code. If I take away the stimulus, the wandering of my mind is like an endless roller coaster and it&#39;s actually very, very difficult to focus. I&#39;ll come up with a trillion fascinating ideas, but won&#39;t have time to elaborate on any of them.

I was borned and raised in cuba so I experienced the shift first hand. Over ther we don&#39;t have internet so I was able to create new recipes and absorb the material for my classes mich faster

i think this video is an awesome way to stimulate our minds, I&#39;m an english student and actually i could understand the most part of he said, but i do need to increase my speaking, at the moment it&#39;s mid and this pisses me off

Right now..I am in office and not working and watching this video..Shall I consider myself distracted?

funny thing is sometimes i get distracted by my own thoughts, i was trying to focus on something but my mind just decides to wander somewhere else and berore i knew it i was thinking of something else

These videos are not usefull during exams, soo dnt come here and waste ur time 🤣

Distractions may be of two types i.e external and internal. There are many tips and advice to manage the external distraction and less on managing the internal distractions including the lots of mental noises, confusions, clutter, and overstimulation as explained by Chris. I think most of us are trying too hard to find the clarity of mind of what we want out of life. This is retarding our productivity and profitability. I guess Chris has provided good important points in his talk to help manage such internal distractions - perhaps to take it slow and easy...

Congratulations on such an amazing achievement, can&#39;t wait to see your channel grow even bigger.

hi

Thanks!

Wow what a information sir love ir teachings

The only time i dont want distraction is when advertiser suddenly pop-up on a youtube video i watched.

VERY NICE VIDEOS

“and so”

Really rude to let some guys play basketball in the background while this guy does a TED talk.

One track task oriented

I&#39;m watching this in 2022 and I think all the people should watch this in today&#39;s situation.We&#39;ve actually quarantined ourselves with devices. Whenever something happens, for example, we get upset, bored, anxious, etc... we keep using our devices as a way to forget! They&#39;re the most addictive things and that makes this situation even worse!We don&#39;t spend much time feeling the presence, we&#39;re not giving our minds any space and I think that&#39;s at least one of the reasons why many people have lost their minds during the quarantine :(

me trying to learn how to be focus..and now im hard to focus on listening to this video.

Coffee bruh.

Can be a life changing video..

Maybe this also has too do with how people feel that some things are hard to manage when in reality the difficulty of the thing stays the same?

So, I&#39;ve been cooking lunch aand dinner for the past 2 weeks (around there). Does that make my mind less stimulated?

This should be studied in schools. Pretty much every TED should be. It&#39;s amazing know that almost everything which is essential in your life and professional life is not studied by school, supposed to learn you basic abilities in your daily life, but the world teaches it to you, the own life, and with your own own efforts you have to comprehend these things.

Meditate… lots of other benefits too

I would love to be off my phone but as an independent contractor I can’t do that…

Don&#39;t be hyperstimulated but  be hyperfocused.~^^

My focus is so bad that I didn&#39;t even finished the video.

<a href="">10:27</a> where is anchester?

I already caught myself getting distracted lol
This just confirmed what I saw today in the lack of attention span during a conversation with someone that wasn&#39;t hearing me say I love you over and over because their mind was drawn to their phone and leaving out the door. And it happens with other things too that make that person not pay attention to What&#39;s going on in the home around them. Too much stimulus and for me sleeping better at ngt vs up in wee hrs of morning because my mind is over stimulated. It&#39;s time in 2022 to regain my better sleep habits and better focus

He is too accurate to be ignored..

i cant even focus on this

So now i&#39;m want to do this chellenge.

So you’re saying NT’s should be a little more ADHD lol. Sometimes I watch videos designed for neurotypical’s because i want to see how poorly it translates to neurodivergent’s. In this case it seems like he’s just saying be more adhd. People who are adhd, if you stop using your phone or do stuff to make you less stimulated. It can make things so much harder. I use my phone for everything because it has everything on it. Lists, remembers, Alarms,… if I stoped using my phone as much my adhd could be way worse. It’s takes too much executive function to use things that are not my phone to replace those functions too.

THANK YOU !!!!!

Only reason  I could be improved my listening skills so I try to make easily this

Super charming cute lecturer. Now I&#39;m so calm.

Thank u

This is really so insightful! I&#39;ve noticed how little I get bored because of the gadgets and constant to-do lists, and I missed that feeling. Really great points, definitely going to try and disconnect from the devices more!

Day 13 :  i watched this video again

i m even watching this video on a screen

I was feeling overwhelmed lately. Today, I uninstalled facebook and messenger and bought a separate alarm clock.

Well-said my dear.
It&#39;s so true 8 days of reset and feeling mentally healthier . The problem for me is getting to 1 day without toxic and stress. Even if I could get 1 day of positive and positive life issues with resolve and all the work I&#39;ve put towards my issues worked out and showed some positive out comes.. When this positive actions take place the energy and motivation is a level that provides a energy level that is unreal.  When I have positive actions come back to me I feel like I&#39;m on top of the world and no little or big issues seem like nothing. The hold back for me is the ones who create sadness and walls of issues I&#39;ve already fixed.

The best video I&#39;ve ever seen since the new year has started 🙌

Im knitting and watching this.

Thanks for sharing!

<a href="">15:56</a> minutes of brilliance, thank you for this video.

Lemme go straight to the comment section to see the real experts

Crypto currency is gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. you got any advice for someone that is fresh to crypto. Don&#39;t know where to start..

Thank you!

Walking is the best time to think

I just got an ad about a dad married to his daughter and now I am not able to focus on this video!!!

Will be back after 2 weeks... Wish me luck.. :)

World’s most Boring thing:being dead

Watching one TED talk a day can keep your ignorance away.

That was so good. Thank you!

Saw it said Manchester and I was ready for a British accent lol.

it was an amazing TedTalk ! kudos to You Chris 👏 .

I’m sure I would have learned something from this but I was distracted reading the comments

Can I tell something? You can focus more if you do this. Just don&#39;t watch more videos and go to study. 🤓

This TED Talk was invigorating, it shows how capable we all are when we arrange the scroll-less activities with more traditional hobbies or down time to be rewarded with inspiration and creativity. A simple act to recharge our human batteries.

Ppl telling me to get rid of my phoneAlso them not buying me a laptop for online classes so now I need to answer my assessments using my phone. <b>Yes. Great life it is.</b>

leave phone downstairs/lower time limit weekly/take phone away-&gt; increase attention span

- &#39;our brains are distracted&#39; = wrong, we crave distraction, our mind rewards us for finding it (dopamine)

- we&#39;re at hyper stimulated state

- takes mind 8 days to fully calm + rest

- 1 hour of boredom every day for 1 month meant brain was less stimulated, mind wandered more

- scatter focus -&gt; ideas + plans

- when mind wanders we think ab past (12%), present(28%), future(48%) rest of time, mind is dull/no idea rooted-&gt; minds prospective bias

- capture ideas + moments in notebook to act upon them later

- &#39;we need to fit more in&#39; hustling// we&#39;re doing enough that our mind doesn&#39;t wander when this is where our best ideas come, we need more space

- &#39;distraction is the enemy of focus&#39; = wrong, it&#39;s a symptom of why we find it diff to focus, brain is overstimulated

- 2 week challenge -&gt; disconnection ritual once a week/daily/turn off internet -&gt;rediscover boredom, scatter attention - where do you go?

- state of our attention determine state of our lives

- moments of distraction + overestimation build up + accumulate to make a life tat feels more distracting + overwhelming 

- make mind more calm = productive, creative and better life                                                                                                                                 

(found it reallly helpful)

I didn&#39;t listen what the video saying, I lost focus

Like most, I&#39;m distracting myself watching this.

That was dope.  Thanks

That fact that I thought I was the only one who were addicted to phone for almost the whole day every week.

Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, and may God’s blessings and peace be upon our master Muhammad and all his family and companions. There is no power or strength except with God, the Most High, the Great.
I wonder how many people changed video at 40secs , This is interesting as I&#39;m sure my best ideas came from doing nothing.

<a href="">13:40</a>

Bruh this is so helpful

Another tip: use your devices as shops and live life like in mediaeval days.For e.g. after 6 pm to 6 am- all social media apart from YouTube are meant to be closedAfter 8 to another 8- YouTube shall be closed.After 9pm to 5 am. All the devices shall be rest.Only if the situation is critical, like some medical emergency or some important career or life issue, then only one must access it.If rules where broken,strict action will be taken (that you decide yourself)

He didnt answer the question we&#39;ve been waiting for. just gave us a speech.

This is my first day.. Just amazing 🥰

Reduce the amount of time you spend with the technology. That&#39;s it in the 3rd minutes. Stopped the video and checked my phone away.

His voice is so similar to Mark Zuckerberg...

I agree that there are screens everywhere. I have tried to restrict my phone usage too it creates some sort of vacancy inside me that pushes me towards my phone then the only thing that I am able to do is go to sleep. The best time for me to restrict my screen time is after I wake up because at that time I am in full control.

Fantastic talk, genuinely useful content, and presented brilliantly - thank you for posting 🙂👏👍

Focus is tossed the second you scroll down to the comments whilst listening to his brilliant talk.

Thanks Brin and page

yes &quot;focus&quot;now🙏

I love this speech

Watching this Ted talk on my phone.

great ndan, suwuunn
I watched this video 2yrs ago and realized I didn&#39;t finish it. Must have lost my focus

Struggling to focus on this video

That was very helpful

now, you learn it while watching a video on Youtube.

Is it ironic that I didn&#39;t pay attention to this video?

Chris, you need to learn about the concept of mindfulness. You advocate for mind-wandering, but we need time and space for the mind to not wander if needed.

Brilliant!

he talks really true!

the ad prompts up just when you start explaining distraction lolthis talk very helpful tho afterall!!

Clear and  very nice speech. It&#39;s something we really need these days, thanks. Maybe check out our channel to see the 6 Records Jeroen Nazgul van der Linden set in 2021. Maybe a good one for the TEDx someday.

Really interesting

Thanks for Pata nahi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Explains why my mom can’t focus on the kids

This is proof that the sabbath is the right thing to do!

If you take this advice personally, this can potentially change your life.

!

And I&#39;m on my phone to watch this

Meditation is a good option for getting yourself bored!

We crave distraction at the first place. That’s inspiring.🤩

Bang on.Our brains crave distraction.

Thank u

Sit down everyday at least for ten mins and meditate. Period

Instagram reels have reduced my attention span to 15 sec

25 000 words wtf... can he just say how many page.. if 1 page have about 300 words thats 25000 ÷300 = 83 page.. wow  , its lkie you read litle book.. what a reserche...

Me watching this on my phone whilst i should be studying: 👁️👄👁️

wish me luck, got exams I haven&#39;t revised for in 3 days time

Good speaking 💗
Volume is too low Volume up PLS...

I am a muslim . Today I will like to introduce few aspects of religion Islam to you . 

Few of our beliefs are as follows 

1. We believe God is one . He has no partners. He neither begets , nor is begotten. 

2. We believe in all the prophets of God sent on earth for guidance of people . It includes many prophets,  few of them are Hazrat Ibrahim ( peace be upon him ) , Hazrat Ismail ( peace be upon him, ) , Hazrat Eesa (Jesus)( peace be upon him) and finally Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him)

3. We believe in all the angels , they are also creation of God.

4. We believe there is a day of Judgment 

5. We believe , all mankind will be made alive again by God after death, on the day of judgment. 

6. We believe that all mankind is answerable for the deeds which they do in this life in the afterlife.

7. We believe there is a Paradise made by God.

8. We believe Paradise is very beautiful and it has everything which gives comfort to a person.

9. We believe God has no son and no father. He is the only God. He forgives all sins whichever He wills but do not forgive shirk. Shirk means worshiping anyone other than God , may it be sun or fire or any personality. Also associating partners with God is shirk. Idolatry is also shirk. Shirk can be forgiven if someone ask forgiveness from God and decides to never do shirk in his life.

10. We believe God will enter believers with good deeds into Paradise in the afterlife.

11.  We believe in all books sent by God . It includes Taurat given to Hazrat Musa( Moses) ( peace be upon him) , Zaboor given to Hazrat Daud ( peace be upon him),  Injeel( Gospel ) given to Hazrat Eesa( Jesus ) peace be upon him) and Quran given to Muhammad ( peace be upon him).

 We have five obligations as a muslim to fulfill.

1. 1st is kalima , it is belief that there is only one God and Muhammad ( peace be upon him) is His messenger.  After believing in this a person becomes a muslim. 

2 . 2nd is Salah . We perform Salah five times a day. It is performed in arabic in a specific 

way . It is performed in mosque by men and at home by women , mostly .

3. 3rd is Fasting , it is done for 1 month in a complete year . In this we leave eating or drinking anything from early morning till evening. Then eat and drink till next early morning 

4. 4th is zakat , it is giving 2. 5 percent of free wealth to poor people,  once in a year . It is obligatory for those who have a certain amount of free wealth. 

5 . 5th is Hajj . It is performed in a specific way in Mecca . It is obligatory once in a lifetime for those who can afford to go and come back from Mecca .

 We also believe in huqooq al ebad.  Means rights of people . Means being nice to neighbors,  do not harm an innocent,  being obedient to parents except if they tell something against Islam . But in every case we will behave very nicely with them . And many more .

I invite everyone of you to accept Islam . 

Thanks for reading.

Me watching this video talking about low the screen time 😬

To all those who paused the video and came down to the comment section...... go up and focus again.

I can&#39;t even focus on this video 🥲

I realy like your talk, thank you very much.the root cause of destruction is over stimulation of our brains 💯

Rich people problems lol.

We are living in the age of information and we are consuming unnecessary information through YouTube insta reels Facebook that is why we have made our own comfort zone of screen

his words are really amazing....i will definitely follow your words.....im also using ashwagandha capsules of planet ayurveda i&#39;ve read that its very effective for  brain strenghth

To be honest, I have been distracted from this video 3 times. And yepp, I&#39;m commenting while I&#39;ve not finished the video 🥲

It&#39;s quite funny that now we have to use apps to increase our productivity and management of our time.

bad choice of clothes

This dude really needs to read some books

I&#39;ll do this challenge

This is a test for time stamps. this is the <a href="">1:30</a> mark

Not me watching this while writing my research paper which is due tonight.

Someone once said to me that most people, on a daily basis use less than 25% of our own body&#39;s muscles and far less the movements we&#39;re capable of. Looking at gymnasts and contortionists, I must agree. Imagine the possibilities, if we used just half of our own body&#39;s muscles and possible movements! We could jump buildings just about.

i couldn&#39;t focus on this video

A promise to myself. I will sleep for 10 hours and study for 14 hours everyday. My dream is to be a programmer freelancer and today is 12/15/2021

I&#39;m literally trying to figure out if this guy copies Nas Daily with his manners and intonation or Nas Daily copies him. I think it&#39;s the 1st one. :D

F YOU R HAVING FUN IN SOMETHING YOU DONT EVEN NEED MOTIVATION THEN 

SO WHY DO WE NEED MOTIVATION TO STUDY ?? WE HAVE ENJOY THIS PROCESS RATHER THEN IGNORING IT



~YUVRAJ SHARMA
