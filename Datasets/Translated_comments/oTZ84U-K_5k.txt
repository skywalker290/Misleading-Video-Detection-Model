Here in December 2023 after watching the &#39;Driving The Cybertruck&#39; video to see Marques&#39;s first impressions!

I&#39;m here after Cybertruck Revealed
Any update

you&#39;ll have to post an update video when it comes out and has some wear and tear records.

And it’s still not out In 2034

3 years later, I fall under the &quot;really like it&quot; category. It looks so futuristic and badass, like an armored personnel carrier. It reminds me of the DeLorean combined with something out of cyberpunk or a sci-fi movie.

34837th

Still waiting for the first variation 

I hate it!
my freind has an ex at 14

<a href="">4:47</a> Indias is everywhere

I hate it. Just to think of paying money for that chunk of metal is a sin 

The indestructible body is cool and all but what about the crash tests? There is no crumple zone.

HSDPIUFSDHFAIDSFPASDFNA DIFUASH TESLA TAKE MY DAMN MONEY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH EIFUASOIVHNZXOHVBPIUVZIPDFUBZXIUV
It&#39;s almost 2022 and this car is not here yet lol

That truck would look great on Mars.

Other car brands announce a vehicle and at most 6 months later it&#39;s on the road. Tesla&#39;s announced the roadster and semi truck years ago and still nothing. And now they&#39;ve done it again with the cyber truck.... They literally just put out these concept vehicles just to boost their stocks. Electric vehicles are awesome but Tesla has turned into a hollow money grabbing corporation.

Any company ever: <b>Sells truck or SUV</b>Off-Roaders: I&#39;ll take your entire stock

Will be happy if I get one.. lol

It seems really robust, but how does that affect safety in a traffic accident? Cars are supposed to «give in» so that the force gets distributed to the car, instead of the passengers inside the car.

The price of the truck is so shocking it looks worth way more

The front lights on the roof angle, the front angle, and lower angle looks radical.

This event looked really fun &amp; hype!

<a href="">7:57</a> &quot;To me, not a truck person&quot;  ... Ha!  You don&#39;t need a pickup truck until you buy a house that needs some work.  That&#39;s when the DIY bug kicks in and you need something to haul lumber, air compressor for air tools, plants for the garden, bags of salt for the water softener, pool equipment, furniture, and even more lumber.

The ugliest car ever designed.

I remember watcher this thing be unveiled

Who&#39;s hare after hummer launched their ev suv/truck

The back looks horrendous! But i love the design

You made a mistake with the towing capacity comparison. They might claim 14000lbs towing with this thing and that&#39;s legit, but an F150 can tow up to 13000lbs when optioned for towing. Clearly not &quot;half&quot; of 14000lbs

It looks really slow compared to tesla model s plaid

whoś watching 2021
Hope you can update this video with something similar to your F150 video.

indians are literally everywhere

&quot;Everything is new except the handles&quot;Elon: There won&#39;t be handles

<a href="">1:30</a> they had this they had that, they had an elon musk aswell

Yo, i could see us being homies.... but please, learn to use an iron, if not... as homies i can teach you Secondly. I didn&#39;t say &quot;the f-150 was the best selling truck&quot;, but &quot;the most popular, best selling vehicle, 40 years years straight.... is a ford truck&quot;.  This is total bullshit. It has only been the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 35 years. keep your words close, iron your shit homie.

id rather buy a tesla over any car but id rather by a lightning over any ev truck

Where is the hitch? A truck has a hitch bare minimum?

Please God allow me to buy this !

It&#39;s a really ugly af...! I wouldn&#39;t buy it even if it was for 1$.

i call this a karen-proof car

It looks like the future, like something from star wars or something, I love it

I love it

I like it. It looks really futuristic

Anyone notice at the end how the suspension adapted in level to keep the truck relatively flat while going up that ramp mid turn? Elon wasn&#39;t kidding when he said it&#39;s going to handle like it&#39;s on rails was he, holy crap lol

I ordered 2 Duals with FSD, I was contacted and picked white interior.  The first 1000 trucks are being assembled in Fremont and my delivery date is 11-12-2021. I am really stoked!

I Like it so

<a href="">1:40</a>WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME

I really like the Cyber Truck, It&#39;s dope looking!

He designed this truck with Mars in mind...

<a href="">5:31</a> that sounds like the future

No one will do driving test in this because you cant put your hands at the two o&#39;clock and ten o&#39;clock positions

The jagged intestine subcellularly unite because tailor hopefully crash notwithstanding a sassy dancer. mute, smelly dry

The rebel ophthalmologist conclusively breathe because silk bizarrely cheat under a noiseless girdle. deadpan, alleged vermicelli

Naw that so-called truck is oogly ugly!

Elon is now the richest man on earth..

Are my the only one who didn&#39;t know marques had contacts

REALLY LIKE IT!

2012 Elon:*Being smart, being a proper adult.Present Elon: let’s shoot it.
<a href="">1:41</a> lol
So we have to pick a side... glad there is a choice that is, Different ;)

The design was inspired from a coffin

222k like wow

Only Elon can introduce his new vehicle like that

There is bald guy at the front. 1.30 , And he seems very familiar

What a rewatch.

2028 hey elon we need a cybertruck 2, okay should we do curves now??elon: we need squares as wheels

I love everything about it but the look

There is no cybertruck in cyberpunk

Looks like a car that would be in cyberpunk.

Anyone here after Elon is now the richest person on earth?

I can&#39;t buy it so I will say I like it

Watching this in 2021 gives me anxiety. So many people. :):

First impression:is that a box

The threatening octave connoly jump because semicircle immunologically battle below a splendid llama. knowing, racial encyclopedia

The harmonious bamboo presently count because sandra thessaly spark than a closed hippopotamus. irritating, auspicious spoon

The protective sidecar contradictorily ruin because flute pathologically cheat qua a ugliest steam. nutritious, capricious aquarius

It’s like Elon’s kid made it in Minecraft and he said “perfect!”

Who heard when he said holy mother of bathman

If they can convince people to buy the design, it&#39;s easily manufactured by robots. All you need to do is cut straight lines.

I was so happy when I saw this Tesla Cybertruck &#39;cause I finally found a car that I can draw!! LOL

The ceaseless cellar neurochemically film because net temporally consider till a verdant bill. royal, tacit position

The detailed rose anatomically scream because rest fifthly dress along a impossible hat. little, well-groomed gliding

has the same aesthetic value of a communist concrete building

That&#39;s a Sikh person behind marqus wow! Proud

At the beginning I really hated it, but now I really like it. I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

.

And so, however, even after such a great many profound self-sacrifices, incredible personal accomplishment in technology, wealth, power, and fame to this point and date, Mr. Elon Musk, many great men, and the whole world are still neglecting, unable, and failing to notice some of the greatest unresolved meaningful tasks; left undone, awaiting, need be resolve asap in order truly heal and rescue the many internal and external illnesses and problems throughout the world. What could that be? Very best wishes always,altc, Paideia Academy and Society.

The special actress likely bang because toad theoretically wrestle sans a ill mistake. psychedelic, exultant religion

<a href="">5:51</a> wait wait wait...I know this person

The glass breaks because of hit by sludge hammer  on door which starts crack at corner Which results in breakageOther wise in steel ball free fall test it performs well.

Elon Musk!
This is a really beautiful pick up but the problem of electric cars is always the same, the time it takes to recharge, with a ford f150 in 5/7 minutes you have fulled the tank, you have paid and you could drive again, with this vehicle you must need 1 hour at least to fully recharge the battery

<a href="">5:51</a> That&#39;s Zack That&#39;s Zack !! 
Me peels potato
Holy mother of Batman 

yo, imagine Elon felt so confident in the windows that he sat in the seat

This how I peel potato

Actually this car is pretty hard to draw

Please hurry up and get here

You got a sadarji passenger &quot;bale bale&quot;...we both are from same country obviously INDIA.

I want a matte black cyber truck so I can call it the bat mobile.

goku vs beerus
Anyone else saw jerryrigeverything at <a href="">5:49</a> ?

Love it

i like it. even though the design is not good doesn&#39;t  mean it is bad, we are talking of the quality and the safety of the car and not the design

i ordered 3

Imagine getting hit by cybertruck

<a href="">5:39</a> how many of you see that face on the road.....THE FACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT

What is that beginning song I looked up Jordyn but I can&#39;t find that song

I keep thinking it’s fake... but it’s real 

Ugly truck toy truck.

When you could see people...

and yes ur human and yes we are watching uand yes stop saying and yes

<a href="">5:50</a> that&#39;s JerryRigEverything lmao. How did I notice? He has huge fucking Arms I mean look at those muscles dude.

<a href="">2:17</a> there&#39;s a lot you can &quot;pick up&quot;i see what you did there...

The reason people hat it is exactly the reason people love it. It looks different and people are not used to a car looking like this, aside from scifi movies.

Everyone should do the simple imaginary &#39;branding test&#39;. Imaging that you swap out the Tesla logo with a Nissan logo on the Cybertruck. Would you really still buy it? The same goes for the Tesla solar roof. I know that Elon sends out rockets, wants to go to unlivable Mars, builds flamethrowers and it all looks exciting, but that is all just branding that is selling the cars/trucks.

I love the design

<b>THIS IS GOING TO BE BAD ASS</b>

CANT WAIT FOR MINE

<a href="">01:40</a>&quot;Holy...mother of...batman&quot;     

i really like it

This is a pickup you didn&#39;t know you needed.  I&#39;m #280,000 in line.  All those F150/Silverado/Ram owners will continue to poo-poo this thing until they see a real one out in the wild.  Then they will get into their $75,000 pickup/living rooms with 17 mpgs and kick themselves for not at least waiting for them to come out and get a test drive one.

If I had the money, I would like to buy one. But I&#39;m just a teen. :(

That thing is an eyesore

<a href="">5:50</a> Is that JerryRigEverything?

It will ship in the holiday seasonProvided you are in the United States

One thing they should add based off video of the interior... cup holders!

What phone did you use to film this coz it looks so detailed

The reason the cyber truck is made with these angles is because the material they use is stronger than commercial car metal and thus harder to mold

What’s the intro song bc I couldn’t find it

Looks like a car from minecraft. He needs to hire a new designer

I like it, it seems catchy and I like electrical cars.

Elon&#39;s kid drew this and he turned it into a real truck

Too early leave  this for the future

I want it

I kinda want one just because everyone hates it. You&#39;ll never not see me driving down the street lmao

After this event there where 1000 jobs free by Tesla!

It looks like a pine derby car
That is not a truck. That looks likes a replica on the pyramids on Egypt.

Rumours that Telsa are using Energy Web and its token within its Tesla Autobidder. Pilot project in Australia. Just an update of the Model 3 will open the possibilty to charge at bottom hours and sell electricity at peak ours. Stabilizing the grid and making money for you. Win win. Just love the ideas Elon Musk realize!

Looks like the prototype for something else, but a prototype made from an 8 years old kid

Radar: yup something with a bunch of right Angels is here.

First time i saw that truck on a video i was like yeah looks like a brick with wheels but seeing more of it actually looks pretty cool

i don&#39;t think that motorbike thing will be sold because Elon said he&#39;s not going to sell motorbike&#39;s because they are to dangerous

Ssoooo sick
This is what happens when Roblox comes to life.

I&#39;m going to be Buying a Few of Those Bad Boys! Let me know if you want to In house Finance them from me at 0%

Looks very...strange!

so ugly lol

LoL!!!!!!

&quot;The future favors the bold&quot;

I want it

<a href="">5:52</a> jerry
Imagine the gov&#39;t buying a bunch of them to replace police cars

What’s so special about this ugly truck?

They did indeed make an ATV

Ahem .... Roof Racks. ? .....Like ... what about roof racks ? I can&#39;t see how I can put my canoes and kayaks on the top of a pyramid..

  best race ever️️️  <a href="">1:52</a>        
Holly mother of Batman

INTRO PLEASEI’ve been searching Spotify and youtube for an hour and found nothing 

Is this gonna be in cyberpunk 2077? Maybe he just wanted to be in the game

Tesla really wants a millarary contract like imagine a Tesla tank

I love it

I ordered one too, but too bad it&#39;s NOT going to be produced! @

The 2020 f150 is like 14000lb towing, so, identical. Not 7000lb like you suggest... thats like a powerful minivans towing capacity..

This is the ugliest vehicle ever.

I want one!!!

bro i want one so fucking bad

Aerodynamicist: &quot;so when do i st..&quot;Guy with ruler: &quot;done&quot;

If you know Elon Musk enough, you will know he prepares these for the up coming mass extinction and colonization on Mars. Decentralized solar power system, cars can run on Mars, and SpaceX.

Where the fuck are you going to park that?

<a href="">5:35</a> a pop? This thing doesn’t have any exhausts

I fell in love ️
Looks like a Warthog! Really cool!

Make it look like the car from cyberpunk and I&#39;ll buy 

will this be on cyberpunk 2020? It should be

Really hate it

If you put a machine gun on that, All i can see is the purge.

2020 ig

This exisits?

So clean

This car is stolen from Mars.. Don&#39;t Trust Elon<b>THIEF</b>

We are as Cyber Track doesn&#39;t exist

Love it

Obviously it&#39;s a car. When does the truck model come out?

All other trucks now look dated.

The Cybertruck does not look like &quot;a 5 year-old&#39;s interpretation of a truck&quot;, as a lot of people have been joking.It looks like an engineer&#39;s interpretation of an electric Humvee.It looks like a tank, and it&#39;s built like a tank.

As for aesthetic, at first time to process then gradually drawn to its unique style :&gt;

It looks really good at night when only the headlights are visible.

Isn’t it a good thing that the glass window breaks?what if one day it fall in the water an u need to break the window to come out

I love the way it looks.  The delorean truck

It&#39;s a Canadian vehicle (South Park).

Are the airbags rectangular???

lol my uncle got one. Just imagine in 3 years how cybertrucks look normal in the everyday life

i made the same exact truck out of boxes when i was 6

This is ultimately amazing

This looks like a design from designers who got B&#39;s in art school, but should&#39;ve gotten a below F if that grade existed.That thing looks like a Minecraft party truck.It looks like a reject Transformer that was kicked out of Cybertron. It looks like a bad 1981 movie set in a 1997 future. It looks like confused polygons. Looking like an abstract artwork that hates itself.

it looks so good

Great video! If I designed a truck like this back in college, my teacher&#39;s would&#39;ve given me an f for sure. Times are changing. I also see Elon makes things for rebels and anarchist. This truck is great for someone living out in the desert, off the grid. I think it&#39;ll be all over for 1 yr then people will not have them anymore...like the BMW green car that looks like a bubble.

Since I can’t stay in the middle... love.

Guys at <a href="">5:50</a> is that Zack from Jerry rig everything who does teardown and durability test

Hey Mar. Please do sth to help me your subscriber. I am one of the guys who use your referal and contacting via emails before, please look at my situation. Over the last 5 days of owning a brand new model 3, I have to return the car like almost 4 days out of 5 days, I am in the process of return it to dealer for the third time!! They keep giving the safety restrain system error. Please do something! Can you ask elon about this situation. Thank you so much.here is the original comments about the situation. look at eric (my comments).​@​

We are behind by 15 years. We were supposed to have this model by now.

i love it getting some idiots that review phones to drive a truck(and worse talk about it)  made by a nerd that got hair implants love IT

Mars veichle?
ugliest design for a truck ever!

I am a sceptic - because I want it to be good. I think this thing has a lot to proove!!! You cannot just come out ... tell everyone you beat just  about anything ... and then fail to deliver ;)

The Geometrymobile

I absolutely love Elon, he’s so awkward it’s become his quality. He’s always fidgeting, and joking with his audience, laughs at his jokes which most don’t get, and then ask how come no one laughed... then say “it was a joke haha”  Sweet... I would love to spend a day with him, and drown in his sad eyes. I don’t know about other women out there but I’m Sapiophile.

1st impression:  Lmfao! Wth is that Tesla? Who designed that, a kid???  Lmao!2nd impression: That&#39;s actually a bad ass truck for an EV.  Basically, an electric tank/super truck daily.

Cant wait for TFL Truck to get their hands on this and take it up the Ike Gauntlet loaded with 14000 pounds of trailer and cargo.

Cant wait to get blinded by one of these.

Hey, quick question, where are the side mirrors? I&#39;m fairly certain those are required to be street legal.

Has 120 and 240 v plug ina and   that much of adaptive suspension this truck is beyond anything  def preorder  gas is dead now i guess once this and the roadster is realeased

Anyone remember when Homer Simpson build a car? xD

that thing looks amazing , makes the new land rover defender look like a model t

thats so fucking cool

Can’t help but to think this remind me of the cars from Total recall color and design ‍️

for the glass braking i think they done that on purpose to get kroe attention to the car

Ever play Hunter on the Amiga. ;)

I love it, its futuristic. Its just something fresh in a car world where everything has almost the same foundation designwise. I also feel like this car probably will be a trendsetter for other car brands to step out of known formulas that they&#39;ve been following for 20 years. Plus its not expensive at all and will be having the typical telsa-ish comfort standarts which are great.

<a href="">4:09</a> well, that’s one way to put it.

It has no good looks its stupid

I’d buy it
The design talks to me. I like it.

The body work may actually save them money. Since the folds for the body are so simple.

Sorry Elon, that’s about the ugliest truck I’ve ever seen. Cookie-cutter model would be better than this lol

So freakin Ugly.

Does anyone know who is the guy at <a href="">04:53</a> on the back seat, holding a iPhone 11 Pro with a Mous case on it??

how are they going to keep the ass end from slipping all over the place ??

People thinking this cat is dangerous but dont know what normal trucks, SUVs, and 18 wheelers do to humans lol. Vehicles are significantly more dangerous than any weapon actively used to kill people. Says alot about usage, people, and safety.

Intro track name?
<a href="">5:51</a> Here&#39;s the better tesla truck -Truckla

<a href="">1:57</a> all the phones are iphone x

Probably the worst designed car after the Fiat Mulitpla. As if they printed out the low graphics settings.  Body shops of Tesla: &quot;Hey Elon, we had some issues getting parts of our cars to replace.&quot;Elon: &quot;Ok, next time we use as simple parts as possible. No shapes whatsoever.&quot;The best example of &quot;you can sell anything as long as it has that name on it&quot;.

It’s ..... very different 

I pity the car accident victims involving these things. Looks familiar, like it was in some 90&#39;s movie.

I hate the living shit out of it

Where is the ac

Didnt like design.luk lyk toy truck
When can I trade in my F150?

I hope it has good airbags. If you get in an accident, you do not want your head going through that marble dashboard.

I like it. But.. it&#39;s basically Cyberdyne bait.

The design is really growing on me, but the 3/4 view just looks wrong for some reason.

18 days, I’ve come around, putting my $250.00 in. Good luck today with your lasik.

It looks like a coffin... Hehe

How many of u hated head light

It looks like something I drew in kindergarten.

Plot twist : this car is designed by his son

I think the top part should be flat and round windshield across other then that it’s an ugly waste of money truck  halo game got better looking vehicles  then that

Elon just wanted to get his car to Cyberpunk 2077

Go fuck you tesla and all tht tech, i really miss old machinery, just give me fucking wheel and 500hp and am ready, i am tired of this sensor this sensor there i really miss those  old cars they had soul but this generation of the kid robots will never know that feeling!

Tesla fanboys cult, I&#39;m suing Tesla my nephew drew that in the 5th grade

Looks like something out of a Halo game.

It looks like a lego car

Markass brownie is how will anounced it right?

There’s two issues that crossed my mind when they revealed the truck. First being the weight with that steel “frame” or body or whatever they’re calling it. There’s a reason why cars changed from steel back in the day with muscle cars to the panel sheet metal we use today both for weight and safety as the cars that hit those solid steel cars would be destroyed and potentially really hurt those not in the steel car. Second is the no side view or in fact any real mirrors as relying on a screen could potentially cause huge accidents if the screen were to die out and the driver has no way of seeing his rear and sides

I love this truck, I ordered one! Even though I am a student and don&#39;t know if I can afford it

if you end up in the water with your cybertruck, then it is a sailor grave or coffin.  (glass is unbreakable you can&#39;t get out)

<a href="">5:31</a> this thing&#39;s gonna be badass bro

Love it. Got my $100.00 on it.

Better fix that soft ass suspension. I wouldn&#39;t haul a bag of mulch in that thing.

Elon musk deserves a knighthood

They must ensure that you can smash the glass, because if you drive in the water you can not get out. Car glass that is unbreakable is dangerous if you get into the water with an accident.Then it is a cyber coffin.

Hey big fan of your channel ! Do you think that Tesla will come with their own trailers that will have a motor or extra batteries or will create something like a power bank that will be added to regular trailers in order to offer extra mileage while towing ? Greetings from Romania

Hope it’s in cyberpunk 2077

If you go off road and start compromising the tires, will those covers pierce the side wall??...

But,where are the side view mirrors,the car is not street legal without them

Looks like a Origami truck.

I thinks it’s cool  it looks like a car from the future

It’s stunningly beautiful, ordered it immediately without hesitation. Can’t wait for my tri motor to arrive.

Tesla wants to make everything look like Minecraft

Love it

Minecraft meets the eighties

The more i see it, the more i really like it! I love how it is so different yet so interesting. 

But surely this is super unsafe, a bonnet/hood crumples to absorb shock, but if the cyber truck is solid, the shock will be transferred into the persons body

It’s truly awful

it&#39;s grown on me

I like the design for some reason it looks quite nice

Beautiful and ugly... Like the SR-71. Design something around accomplishing a goal instead of visual appeal, and it creates its own aesthetic.

So this style looks really like  back to the past&quot;!

This will be yet another vehicle for Tesla where demand &gt;&gt; production capacity for years to come. Another W.Any EV fans, would love to have you come join my new channel. I hope to bring real value and new insights on Tesla and our EV future :)Have a great day.

Millennials:  OMG I’m so broke, we need the taxpayers to pay our student loans off NOW!  Millennials at Tesla Cybertruck reveal:  WOW I’m going to order the Tri-motor version and take out a huge loan cause it’s super duper cool and save on gas. I need it to look cool. (Sips latte). I also live in an apartment.

half life-ish graphic

Looks like a roblox car tbh

Elon : Honestly I did it for the memes

When you forget that you didnt add protection to your car in gtav

Oh my god its been so long since the roadster where is it

Look like tesla is going to launch this vehicle for Mars Test

I wanna race this thing with my lbz duramax

It’s the illegitimate child of an el Camino and delorian

It looks like a car from bladerunner

Hey, it&#39;s better than any crossover.

Correction on one statement you made,  the Ram truck changed designed cue of a pickup truck when it broke from the pack and made there truck look like a semi truck. Since that time more pickup trucks have copied that design with the bold grill look.

A truck...that’s not a truck.

4 words &quot;it&#39;s an ugly cunt&quot; there I said it I prefer looking at a fiat MULTIPLA

Ok. Took me a few days, but I want one.

Where are the mirrors

This is quickly going to become a police/military vehicle.

So when I turn my triangle with a fifth wheel trailer do I destroy the trailer or box?   Just wondering?

I’ll bet next weeks paycheck that the final production model looks nothing like this. 

So lucky to get a lasil surgeryEveryone is Not That LuckyBOL Tho

Remember the cars we drew as kids, thats it in real life.

Eww gross no thanks

I think the idea of going into futuristic designs is just awesome, for sure it&#39;s gonna take some time to come around but I&#39;m sure it would change the way we view things

<a href="">5:51</a> i know that bald man

It looks like a box turtle

Shit
This car looks like my drawing as a 5 year oldAlso who else saw that guy recording with a 3Ds

Behold! The ‘Persephone..’

I completely hated it at first. I got rid of all of my preconceived notions of what a truck should be and tried to look at it with fresh eyes. Then I loved it and pre ordered.

Aw, no more glasses? So cute with them, though!

Really hate it

Ugly as hell..

This thing looks like a glitch in the universe.

they intentionally didn&#39;t make the glass durable for extra press...

This car is a huge step back, waste of money few hundred thousand project to make a millions. This cars design is shit,  interior is shit, It has nothing in it. Probabnly that cars computer also snitch on you while you smoke weed in it or while you bang someones gf on the back seat. Fuck this shit. I feel now much better and happier having stylish bmw from 2000 year.

I&#39;m guessing it doesn&#39;t have a crumble zone.  So you pretty much become an omellette in case of an accident

Thanks for memes tesla
Ugly car

dont do lasik
It can poke you!Poke Mon car...

Pretty sue that hammer hit was a so soft ... at least good actor

I&#39;m going to sue tesla... man i need my payment for deigning the car.. i designed this car when i was 4 yrs old and somehow that important drawing was stolen... TESLA u need to pay me for the design or else I&#39;m suing u

Tesla fans hit here
its batman&#39;s tech

Designer: At least we will have something Completely New and Unique On the Roads from now on.... by Tesla.  Thank you Elon Musk!

9.8 subscribers and 9.8 views ! Amazing 

So....they finally built the Warthog...lol.

Is it made of cardboard?

Original glasses tho!

“I went and watched the unveil and was lucky enough to be a passenger once” should be the title.

Elon has some awesome vision for the planet, but this is one fucktard of an idea!...lol

Elon is well connected with government contracts, wonder if DARPA gave him  a little R&amp;D sugar....

Elon Musk def got that rendering truck idea from the F150 truck Roblox or something xD

Too much what if. big car
Isn&#39;t this thing a joke!! I swear it is, it&#39;s disgusting

Synthwave truck

The steering wheel is so ugly

One word Ugly!

The steering wheel is so ugly for a truck. Super cringe for me.

Looks better than the hummer

It looks like Lego and DeLorean worked together and thats not all. Somehow it reminds me of my old inox fridge.

Well, the future of cars is certainly having a potential and its own start, or maybe it started before.

I want to buy it its under 2cr

@<a href="">4:46</a> Oo paaji tussi pohach gaye waha...changa fer ;)
Love from Bangladesh ️

<b>Somehow looks like an unfinished 3D model lmao</b>

Can this please be put in rocket league?

Super

The design department used Minecraft as the modelling software 

I like it

Elon Musk changing the world

Looks like it came from the set of Black Mirror

Me: oh no! I hit somthing hard!Friend: I’ll fix it!Me: you better not do tha-Car:

Most people said similar things about all of his other vehicles. I think it will be a hit. Getting off of natty resources is a good thing. I think the design will grow on people. If i could afford this i would buy it. All he has to do is market to gov&#39;t agencies also. Think about how well cng vehicles selling to them. Most local private sanitation and public transportation fleets are cng. In 15 years they could all be tesla.

Elon can&#39;&#39;t get to space fast enough so he&#39;s bringing space to earth instead.

I’m deaddddd mans was recording with a iPhone 6 at <a href="">4:47</a>

<b>That Tesla Junk doesn&#39;t cost even to finish watch this video.</b>

Its best but looks is not good

Imagine people from about 50 years time looking back at this video and reading our comments, seeing how surprised we are, when it’s probably gonna be normal for them at that time

Good for stealth mission?You can probably install many flat LED panel on the thing and have it camouflage.

It has no warmth or personality.  Its damned ugly like the future dystopia Musk is inching towards.

If you want a headache buy one.

Am all up for redesigning and all that ... But that&#39;s just ugly. My heart pains on stress concentraions at the corners and wind drag.

Definitely they forget to render

This is a human being vaporizer. As close you have this tank from your body the higer your chances to die.

<a href="">5:51</a> TRUCKLA!!!

The Cybertruck reminds me of something a toxic GTA 5 online player would chase you in...But not gonna lie, pretty bad ass

But ugly. Buck Rogers wants his vehicle back.

Glass is Glass and Glass Breaks :JerryrigEverything

My unpopular opinion: the truck looks REALLY COOL!

I&#39;d buy one, i like that it is totally different than anything else. However, living in Japan i couldn&#39;t give myself a harder time driving this around on the tiny roads here...too bad.

At <a href="">5:50</a> who&quot;s the guy?!@

Why do people hate it? It looks so awesome!

The New De-Lorean

im gay
If it cant fit full sheets of plywood along with a 1000 pounds of tools daily its not a truck for me....lets compare it to a dodge 3500 power wagon of an f350

Just saw that vid of the cybertruck play tug of war against a normal truck n won effortlessly.. some guy even put a sledgehammer to it. Elon wants us all to drive invincible Batman tumblers n destroy the city! Would something like this even be available to the public? If yes, there will be no use for roads. Haha A bit scary if u actually think about it  

It’s like a Jeep truck... but a little less ugly

I want to get it and paint it hot pink

This truck is attractive

What&#39;s it&#39;s price??

It&#39;s the stupidest design I&#39;m ever come across. Please improve your design I&#39;m sure it will sell for lot more.

I like it

Someone is looking at their killer.  This thing will obliterate anything on the road it comes in contact with except maybe 18 wheelers.

why they made so ugly car what that shape did they let to kid design it?

Nice report, thanks. Per your surgery mention in the vid, please do research more on efficacy and outcomes as to Lasik...it&#39;s not always a great thing. Even one of the original ex-FDA advisors says he wouldn&#39;t approve it now. (Just saying)

Piece of shit.

Damn
This truck is in a class of its own. It&#39;s not a 4x4, AWD, ATV nor SUV but.....UAF vehicle.  Its Ugly As F....

bonnet too long

they did it for the mems

Y would the everyday man need a bulletproof pickup truck?? Especially one that drives so loudly... This car is good for a few men with crazy jobs maybe, but the guys really considering purchasing it, r all youtubers... 

can you do the Reaction to me and Dj Unk new song call Look At Her ITs PLAYA K FT DJ UNK LOOK AT HER Thanks

i think we should talk to CEOs of tesla to do some special designs for our machines as well!!!by the way tesla the scientist is my hero and i think he is honored that you are using his name for your country

Its Design for The Rock 

I like it

I like the design path, I think more could be done with it, but at any rate, makes the other trucks look like tonka toys.

Tata safari hyper world wide class face lift ₹₹₹₹₹₹
Never been this excited about a car...

Finally Tesla made a car which i used to make by cardboard ️️️

It&#39;s so ugly, I want one!

thats not car that is a apc

Looks ugly.   Reminds me of the cars in back to the future 2 and I can see it has a knight rider steering wheel.   Guess Musk likes those movies and show. Also if it’s all bullet proof. Good vehicle for criminals to use during a crime and can’t be stoped. Also guess the design team lost there drawing compass the day they designed the body  and only had a square .   Highly doubt people will buy this it will be a flop

The. lights at <a href="">04:38</a> :D

It looks super dope

Man I cannot get used to seeing that

Is it going to got in the average garage

Why are cars getting uglier by time? I hate the design. the exterior is simple and bad and the interior as well... its all sooo simple. If the car/truck did not have the name Tesla it would not have been this popular.

Intimidating.

Looks like a roblox version of a lamborghini

Real life roblox

&quot;Does it come in black?&quot;

That range is going to be reduced with a load.

Drive it across NM and see how many people call in UFO sightings

that is literally the ugliest car I have ever seen

Dec 10 is when my first car payment due 

It is a dump truck! Very ugly

It&#39;s a fucking Fiat Multipla with an electric charge

It looks like a mine cart

Looks like an ISIS improvised armored truck

I prefer reading comments rather than watching the video 

This looks like something you could drive on planet Ma... nevermind

I will give this car 10 on 10 love the car 

ROBOCOPs Truck
from the looks perspective its not good

It looks like a really sarcastic design.I like it

I have no idea what he said because my volume  was not working

Designer: Behold the power of my ruler

This truck looks like as if Godzilla baby had sex with transformers

<b>Honestly is probaly stealth..</b>

I personally think about the model of this car looks like iron man first suit made in a cave 

That is the shittiest looking truck ever.

Unimpressive un urban monster..who designed this sledgehammer? Tesla has missed something....

I like it. I&#39;d like to buy it, in my dreams.

I like it

I like it

It’s looks like me if I design a car
It’s like a toy not an actual car

It&#39;s a flex car. It won&#39;t attract pickup drivers or traditional ICE users. But it will attract Tesla fans, people who like to flex, and the occasional user who wanted to drive a &quot;futuristic&quot; car

So Tesla joined the comedy club?  They forgot the square wheel upgrade!

youve peaked my interest.
I would bet substantial money the glass breaking was on purpose.  Everyone making fun of you is still everyone talking about you.

i like the look.

that ain&#39;t get no bed. that ain&#39;t no truck

What about crumple zones to absorb impacts in an accident?

My only question is why is no one talking about the missing side mirrors and the effects, or it’s replacement. What is replacing the side mirror? I know it has rear camera but is that really enough?

The most hideous automotive design ever.  If it really sells in large quantities I’ll be amazed.

I love it

<a href="">5:50</a> Truckla potobomb

Still not a Tofaş
It&#39;s just remind me of halo 

Yeah, 60 

AI Artificial intelligence 100,000 of those trucks armed. 
This reminds me car from carmageddon PC game where one of goal is kill as much pedestrian as you can (extra points).

I wonder how that granite countertop works in a crash test.

Puri gaadi thik hai bus 50 rs. Ka kamina ne shisha toda You tube hai to saste youtube banoge kya

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF CYBERPUNK!!!

Mmmm this car.....Robocop 80 design

Love it, ordered one.

I thought and thought about the design... well, God bless him, with the outer part. But what kind of garbage is inside? Will they modify it, I wonder, or will they leave it that way? P.S.: and, yes, the wheel covers are HARD!!!
Look at this car

The metal they used for it is t that malleable so they couldn’t bend it into round shapes, hence why it’s so edgy.

What is someone us this as SVBIED

I like it... Reminds me of a Lamborghini. The Urus should look like that...

Back to the future part 4...

Yawn - Tesla - who cares.

Elon Musk was high when he made that

so the fire gys can get u out incase u crash thats why they break

we need DMC

Edison laughs in polygon.

cool design
It’s growing on me. I love it now.

If you want to see how poorly strange looking pickup trucks sell, just look at the first generation Honda Ridgeline.

Uhhhhh where are the side view mirrors

Just remember but i think no one noticed but the tesla cybertruck has no side rear mirrors

look like a top gear toy

Hell sheet...an SUV...but on a flat drive-tru course...IT&#39;S a fukkin SCAM...to sve elon&#39;s hiney from chapter 11...where&#39;s the uneven terrain trough and turns?...drive thru partial submersion?...steep angle inclines and declines?...forget pull and push for a moment...safety features?...sure sell 200K of there so we can kill 200K idiots and 600K innocents...sounds like a good purge year coming up :D

Truck is not something i would ever buy. It ugly and looks like it would run for two miles and battery run dry.

Fugly redefined.  Fugly.

I don’t see it in my radar?..

I like it. I really like it

It&#39;s too ugly

I kinda like it, it sounds like it&#39;s the only piece of futuristic tech that actually works. reminds me of a DeLorean, Lets embrace the Syntwave/Cyber punk style

looks like a delorean
Pretty sure the main attraction is the single light bar which is illegal and unsafe. Nice bait and switch by Tesla. Once they go into production, they’ll have standard dual lights like every other car out there.

Is this serious?  thats tesla truck???

What’s the song at the beginning

I stay in the middle.

Looks like truck for army :D

Where is the FLUX CAPACITOR located?

To me the most exciting design since the DeLorean. Well done

Throw in a V12 diesel and I&#39;ll consider it.

Fucking and disguting piece of shit

So what happens if it is raining I don’t see whipers

What a car!

Elon:— Let&#39;s &quot;april fool&quot; everybody, but in November !

The word Cyber in fron of the word Truck makes me understand....I love it!!!! Leaders and not followers...period.

Looks like Ps1

Serious side though, unless they never want to sell one in Europe, Australia or Asia seems like this is never going to actually look like this. Pedestrian safety regulations is the reason why we have such cookie cutter designs, and the harsh reality is that if you&#39;re preordering one of these in say Australia where I&#39;m from or Europe, where I&#39;ve lived - I can tell you, your not going to get anything like what you&#39;ve &quot;ordered&quot;.

At first glance I’m like wtf ! But after watching it move and the lights I’m like wow it’s looks pretty cool

Kind of cyberpunk 2077 inspired design and presentation 

No side mirrors

Lower graphic = faster speed<b>That&#39;s how mafia works</b>

Fuckin disgusting piece of shite, I&#39;ll take a 60s mini over this piss anyday

Honestly. It&#39;s beautiful.

Fubar

Not a truck. Suv

????? What is Musk on. The truck looks like it was designed by a four year old. Elon, leave off the wacky backy.

Not bad at all, watching for the futuristic way, this is a good start to be the first electric truck in world. Not too defined, or elegant but designs, eventually will get enhanced later. For me looks cool but just too clean, but main idea is great. Looks like the start of Gotham&#39;s style futuristic technology development lol :)

40 for a something that cost no more than 7k to make? lmfao.  Look at the shitty interior! Nothing but plastic and 1 screen?

This is the 2nd most viewed cybertruck video

So when the camera dies for the rear view...you do what? Mirrors work too.

YES

Max-towing on a 2020 F-150 is 13,200 and you can get that on an XL (lowest trim) with the tow package for about $30K, I&#39;m guessing most people buying this truck won&#39;t really care about the payload and towing though. Also thinking that payload number is before it&#39;s spec&#39;d out, because it shouldn&#39;t be a constant 3500 lbs once you add the dual/tri motors, it should drop some... so it&#39;s probably the gross and the actual amount is going to be less.

lmaoo

Just want to touch base that the f250 can tow 15,000lbs

When use roblox studio instead car design program

Fake tough sounds pretty good when it becomes self aware.  I still want one though.  No hope for us.

They designed the perfect truck for nerds and now they realize that nerds rarely buy trucks.

Those lights are too bright - they will blind other road users. Common problem sadly.

Elon brought this up for the memes...don&#39;t take it seriously.

Buy a real Rivian Truck they have product and they know how to make a real truck vs bat mobile.  Tesla will deliver what he wants whenever he can and feels like it and it may be great maybe not. Street driving OK how about straight up a mountain?

That is not a pickup truck

Very impressive but they should have done more on the dashboard, it&#39;s too bare

i want to fuck a cube

wish the top didn&#39;t come to a point.  the edges in the front and back and stuff sure but that triangle top to then slope down for the bed not soo sure.  specs are great, however you get to the 2500 plus and you will find the same towing capacity with longer ranges and if you get a diesel get even more power and range.  for that same price of triple motor.  still, it is an option and looking fwd to what they make of it.

I fucking love it

My Honda even stronger than that for less money’s...

It&#39;s ugly as sin, but I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s performance matters more than it&#39;s looks.  I&#39;ve been waiting for Tesla&#39;s electric truck for years and we finally get a taste of it.  Thanks Elon.

This is real??? Lol, naw I&#39;m good.

Anybody driving this ugly thing on the road is going to be looking very stupid. This is uglier than a pinto.

Lol   What  a flop

I like it I’m Batman
The funniest car I&#39;ve ever seenWhat do the designers of this car drive?

What if you activate Tesla autopilot on the wrong side of the road

Ahh mark ass brownie

Most dysfunctional &quot;pickup truck&quot; ever made. Stainless steel? No bodywork ever and heavy - I knew of a car company that did that once...  This&#39;ll be a real winner in rural areas. Does it come WITH the busted windows?

That headlights are prohibited in my country

It is pretty stupid. Killer performance in such a gimmicky ignorant package.

questa tesla fa schifooooooooooooooooo
Looks like one of the reboot batmobiles (#3?) had violent sex with Doc Brown&#39;s DeLorean while watching one of the Terminator reboots.

Bro I got lasik the day you made this video. Its the best thing I&#39;ve ever done you&#39;ll love it. Just be wary if you use all lasers there is a lot of pressure on your eye,it doesnt hurt but it is a really unconfortable feel for the 30 seconds that it lasts.

Tires should be squares too

That&#39;s straight up hideous

The led (front) hurts

Love it

This truck was designed on a N64

Lights are way to bright to be street legal

Delorian

Watch Jake Paul Buy It

This is like when homer designed a car for his brother herb

Super truck.Reserved the dual. I have Ram1500 ecodiesel. Thank you Elon.

Very ugly car!

First step towards future cars
I liked

This truck looks like a ford F150 had a baby with the termenator

Wait...this things is serious? I saw a post somewhere about it and thought it is a troll post or hoax press release. You are telling me this is supposed to be a production car? OMG?! WTF is wrong with this world. Are you all out of your mind? <a href="">2:36</a> is NOT a sledge hammer, it is a dead blow that is basically NOT STEEL, but a hard rubber over a steel body, with less than a 1/4 of force of an actual sledge hammer, plus the guy doesn&#39;t even swing it with force. Its not aerodynamic, nor does it actually look good (until you put the quad in the back, like you said) and it CERTAINLY is not functional.I love the fact that they use stainless steel, that&#39;s it. I hate the fact that it does not use lights (signal and brake lights) that can be seen from an angle. I also don&#39;t like that you can order it, but it doesn&#39;t even have all the necessary features, mirrors, interior, wipers etc. yet. The charge port is so close to the wheel wells, I would be hating having to dig through the mud and grime, just to get to the charge plug. You must be insane to actually pre-purchase this hype-wagon, you know nothing about yet. That top light in the roof is a pain in the ass for oncoming traffic and I hope CANNOT be operated unless there is no traffic. The signal lights are tiny. The tie-down hooks in the bed are pretty much useless, the way they are tucked away. The recessed lights at the back will obviously accumulate dirt and mud and snow easily. Having a steel bed (slippery) and grooves like that is also useless. Lights on the side of the bed makes less sense than at roof height, when you actually put things in there. <a href="">7:17</a> so the tailgate just rests on the sharp corner of the bumper, without any cables adding strength? 90% of this truck is so prototype...Don&#39;t give these fools a cent! They didn&#39;t even plan the demo right, as they put the wrong dam glass in the doors! The tires are over-inflated, lol...DUDE CAN&#39;T YOU SEE THE SIGNS? It is another bold move from Elon to please the stock market and make money on something that is NOT EVEN READY for production. Not a chance he gets this thing approved for road use the way it is (obviously prototype).

Looks shit.

&quot;useless and monstrous&quot; - these words were addressed in 1887 to the newly erected Eiffel Tower...

Comes from the movie &quot;Upgrade&quot;

love

It looks like a Chinese Lamborghini had sex with a Lego Duplo brick

If they really want electric vehicles to &quot;save&quot; the planet then they would have to be made to last 30 years at least, which they will not. If you care so much it&#39;s much better to drive around in an old car and not change it every 2 years. So far electric cars are show-off pieces of tech for the upper class that make people THINK you care about the environment. Nobody seems to be thinking about the battery manufacturing...

Without mock-up dev implemented..

I feel like the cyber truck should be able to float across water. The idea looks like it came from a amphibian tank .

Wow Tesla
60% of people have successful lasik eye surgery. Some that failed have committed suicide because their eyes burned forever after or they lose their eye sight. Good luck my dude.

Yeah this design is sad, looks like they did not try.

Rear mirrors?
If MINECRAFT had a truck this would be it.

love it!!

it looks very stupid design.

It looks like it&#39;s made out of trashcans make it run on garbage eliminate everything

Looks kinda the car the Top Gear guys built a few years ago

i love it

If Tesla was alive he would be ashamed what is name is used for!

This will look cool in the climate wars. Maybe keep you safe, too. If they fix the glass.

The uglenist is cool

People in Chicago should buy this vehicle.

I love that ️️

tbh i love that thing!

Look ugly as a deep seafish.

That’s what happens when you hangout at the gay bar

Wow! This thing looks like a rock

It’s actually way cheaper than I expected

With the amount of money and clout Elon has he could roll up a piece of turd with wheels and he will find people to buy it,there is just a lot of rich money out there to be spent. Clearly this truck is for a specific targeted audience/buyers

I kinda feel like Tesla is conditioning the market to think less conventionally about transportation while they develop their exoskeleton fabrication techniques.  I don&#39;t think the prime directive here is to sell a lot of trucks with this one, but they&#39;ll take it if it happens.  That said, taste is a product of familiarity and association so... somebody&#39;s gotta go first if you want to change people&#39;s taste and it might stick or even not look weird in 3-5 years?

The real Ironman in real life

It&#39;s wery cool!

Don&#39;t hate it, but don&#39;t care for it.  The concept of the Tesla Dually is a different story, I would be first in line for that one.

I hope the graphics get better buy release date

Nobody should fool anyone, it's very bad.
Designer must love minecraft!

They are paid to make a positive image of this ugly piece

Ugly AF

Firs Drive by who?

Back to Stone age car!!.

The Mexican cartels already have something like this!!

BRDM

Who needs aerodynamics anyway, it only decreases power consumption.

looks shit tbh

What is that shit ? A car ? Oh my Good

It&#39;s ugly...... slight curves won&#39;t hurt, Elon.

piece of shit

Nice one

Gonna say it, that truck will have problems with EU regulations.

I hate the front light bar :D

Ugly asf

Its look like a leggo car.

the carbon footprint and pollution from the refining of the materials alone for the battery packs alone are what you fake ass eco terrorist rave against. just FYI you majority pretentious rich whities

Ugly as fk !!!

no one:litterally not a single soul:Smith: &quot;MARK ASS BROWNLEE!&quot;

I&#39;m good bro‍️
It has a STEREO tape cassette player.

Looks like a wooden car toy .

Dude, someone shot the designer in the brain xD that's so cute
it remeinds me of the warthog from halo !

nice batmobile
What an appalling vehicle......buy a Ford Raptor and be happy.

No no no no no no no no no noooooo
Airbags? And did anyway see the price of fuel!!

Marques, I wish you all the best for your cirgury.!Hope to see you recover quickly.Please, rest after the cirgury.Do not go straight to your lights, or computer.Better to rest 1 day now, than having issues down the line; which may last a lifetime.I want to continue watching your content, and to see you well :)Cheers from Portugal!

I love this design and think about to buy it. I don´t care if some don´t like it.

I can&#39;t figured it out how this thing will be allowed in the street. Basically if you can&#39;t find steel car like that nowadays it&#39;s because in case of a crash it will destroy the other car. Cars have to be flexible enough so both cars on a crash will absorb the shock wave.

Tesla Cyber truck has been batmanified

The 80s are back!!

<a href="">3:21</a> i seriosuly thought that it was a 3d rendering video showing the car

This is not new, Mexicans cartels use this type of vehicle, this kinda dumb tbh

I might be buying one, will send it to my family on Syria 

Looks like Shit, why is musk dressed like the terminator?

I’m happy with my 94 Toyota Corolla

He looks alot like the main vilain from flash (Elon that stupid moron millionaire )

Anyone else starting to like it more after a few days have passed?

itz osm
I&#39;m honestly wondering how much I can save up over the next few years... My adult brain laughed at it, but my 12yo self that wanted a Lambo said &quot;I want it&quot;.The 12yo knows how to have fun. 

My god people put down your phones and just watch a video online lmao can’t stand seeing 100 people just ignoring the presentation and holding up their phones

It’s not another lifted Ford, Chevy, or Dodge with a goddamn Yeti sticker on the back window. .....so what’s not to like?

Not gonna lie. I kinda like it

Lead balloon.

Design letdown :(

hat's a total bummer
Looks like shit

Roblox truck

Looks like Hummer.

I have a question about the interior of the truck. Those who have seen it inside: isn&#39;t this front panel way too edgy? I mean, wouldn&#39;t it hurt to bump into it at a sudden stop?

Why the fuck would you try throwing a ball at the windows not knowing full well that they could withstand it. Test it out before the reveal. If it doesn&#39;t work, leave it out of the script entirely. That cost me some hefty second-hand embarassment.

Ive always wanted to drive a metal box on wheels!!!

That is by far the ugliest thing I ever seen.. looks like a little kid designed it

Its a breakthrough for pickup trucks 

Where is the fckn test ? Delete video now!

This truck will get pulled by cops for not having side mirrors

White guy trapped in black body

looks like it was built out of giant  Legos

How come it looks like Esemka made it hahaha
Wonder how many people got sacked that same night after Elon stood there while that ball shattered not one but two windows But this isn&#39;t going to be the final product right? I mean it looks badass and but it also looked like something Jason Statham would have driven in Deathrace. It doesn&#39;t look really finished. You ordered one i believe and iJustine did but do you really think it looks good ?

Tbh it looks sick

Minecraft!!!

My car : Am I a joke to you??

<a href="">2:50</a> What&#39;s Keanu Reeves doing there?? <b>Somebody get that man, a dog and a car for the love of god</b>

This truck is not for an average Joe.

It looks badass, but I still prefer to see some curves in cars, the low poly look is nice but people will get bored of it fast.

reminds me a lot of a warthog

Next Tesla motorcycle: .

imagine you see bunch of normal looking cars then out of nowhere you see this car and you think if the car is too high quality for you to even see it, so it appears to you in low quality and the driver looks like he doesn’t want any attention.

<a href="">2:56</a> WATCH the red clip holders on the glass all flex/fold outwards... That cushioning wasn&#39;t on the Cyber Truck. WHOOPSIE.

Who is here before 10million views

Some kind of game.
Looks like virtua racer circa 1994.
With window tint, wheels, and paint it would look really different.

Imagine the government or any hackers hacked your car and control to do something with it in future.

I’m gonna put on badass magnets on mine. (If they stay on of course)

i need one

I love it. Tesla Cybertruck looks like it came from Cyberpunk 2077, Blade Runner 2049, and Ghost in the Shell.We definitely need something new and different from the future. I’m just glad Tesla is not afraid of doing something very unique.

Incorrect information; F-150 can tow 15200 pounds.

Ok

It looks like brdm

They better sell these over $100k if not all the teens can afford it and drink and drive and kill hella people with this smh.

woow the quality at first... my eyes started hurting LMAO

No normal truck person is gonna get his it’s just for show offs and people with to much money or wanna make out they have to much

That vehicle looks like it belong on an episode  of South Park  all its missing  is the Canadian  square tires

Mark ass brownie

Where the bed

The truck is hideous even ford,chevy,Mercedes trucks look better.

No face, no expression, no soul.
I&#39;m going to wait for the 16bit version

Ugliest truck i have ever seen

I think the design has some potential but needs some tweaking.  I like what they&#39;re going for, but it just needs some proportions changed a little bit.  Maybe giving the apex a slight curve would help, too.  Not really a fan of the polygonal wheel wells.

imagine hitting ur face on the edge of the marble

ugly af

Low key thoIt pretty ugly....

Where’s the side mirrors

uuugggglllllyyyyy
Bizarre by the way how this video exploded. You got like 3-4x more viewers on this video

I love AND hate it.  LOVE being able to shop at WalMart and not worry about the door being dinged.HATE how I cant afford one lol

I love this pickup

I love the postmodern design. The lights could be a problem for people, not only those with eye problems.

I&#39;d buy it if it came in Vanta Black.

with the marble, the car now officially looks like my kitchen

I guess you can&#39;t bend that stainless steel

I love it! It feels like the future!

Looks good this is one of the best thins ever

They made a warthog! Sweet!

The Jetsons thought of this way back then.

Lmao looks like the cars I drawn in 1st grade 

That thing is hideous looking.

The Good Bad and Ugly. Imagine one with 24 Chrome spinners...

It looks jerk , rough and unfinished rendered image of truck in general

Poor Wifi connection while watching it

I fkn love this thing

Extreme hardwork is done to get this. Excellent work of modern art and engineering. Appreciatable. New era and age of cars and trucks will be started after this cybertruck.

Due to most states new laws being anti-gadget while driving, this &quot;truck&quot; would be illegal in most of the US.

How do you clean the windows

Ugly

Angles are good

The design is nice

Telsa is preparing for the zombie apocalypse! 

What about a single cabin A lot of guys would buy it

This thing is absolutely hideous! The only people who like this are fanboys

Ignore my comment, I&#39;m standing at the bus stop pretending that I&#39;m writing to someone*

Would you buy the Tesla CyberTruck?Yes: CommentNo: Like

Looks like warhog from halo

I doubt any real traditional truck people would ever buy that Minecraft truck.

This thing + terrible driver = killer machine

At first I wasn&#39;t impressed, but the more I see it I&#39;m starting to really like it

This is the ugliest shit I&#39;ve ever seen

i like

Marble dashboard is going to kill people during accident

Look like something a 5yr old drew on a piece of paper and Tesla pull out the trash thinking it was a good design ... ugly looking truck inside and out

Cyber truck was really weird for me at first but it’s starting to grow on me!

This boi came strait out of roblox

I&#39;d have two of those please.

Car Dealer: which do you wantMe: I&#39;ll buy that pixelated car you have

bullshit... looks like my grandpa&#39;s old tiffin box in massive size

Bullet proof, moon roof, electric truck. Huh...  pretty cool!

Love the innovation but I can’t get past the design. It’s a thumbs down for me.

Looks like truck is in  low poly graphics

more fucking stupid car worship

Beautiful lines! Who designed this?!?   
Hated it! Looks like an army vehicle 

What. A. Design. So futuristic. I am speechless.
I drive a pickup truck and all I have to say, this is NOT a pickup truck... trucks have been the same for a long time because they WORK really, really well. Shout out to any Raptor or Rebel owners. The interior of my 2019 Rebel blows this thing out of the water. Zero functionality. Elon’s been drinking too much Tesla Kool Aid. Btw, that’s a rubber sledge... he took about 20% off his swing when he hit the Tesla.

I fucking love it

It’s ugly 

The only thing i like about this &quot;truck&quot; are the lights.

someone likes it

What does it truck?

I have feeling one day we gonna see Batman talking in TV next time they make a car from his movie what else they gonna do maybe they will call him now to drive it or tested on the road

Tank ha ha ha
No Thanks, I like my 1994 GMC Sierra that I paid $3500 for, and the insurance is very cheap

That thing looks dumb.. nice marble in the front?   Haha accident proof??? Haha

Stealth bomber without the wings

Me: Look at this badass new Tesla truck!  My wife: That&#39;s ugly!

Where are the side view mirrors

I hate it
If u fast forward past his personal issues with contact lenses he eventually discuses the truck

Super design
I Love It. It look DOPE. 

I like it because of the Harris ps1 reference

its a last semester project  of my automobile engineering

Model X - overly complex design, Model 3 - really simple design, Model S - just right design....but the Cybertruck- way way over simple design, looks like the top of someone house with wheels on it, just ugly, but if you wanted to have thicker metal for the doors and panels to be dent resistant then the straight  panels is all they probably could do, that is where function out weighted style by a ton, but i would prefer a happy middle ground of function/style as a designer.

Zucco: watta hunk o&quot; junk..ho..ho..ho..

its a Delorean truck...  do they have gull wing doors as an option?

Looks like a kid drew it in 1992

hate it

Where is the bed?????????????

Dolerian mk 2, cant wait for &#39;back to the future 4 - the prequel.

1960 in the future there will be flying carsCyb3rT4uck:

Are you supposed to be blinding the cars in front of you?

Can it take me back to the future?

It looks awesome

you guys ever heard of the warthog?

I can see the appeal, but different doesn&#39;t necessarily mean better. Unfortunately, many don&#39;t give a shit regardless; hype is everything.

Ever read what F-250, 350 or Chevy 2500 can do? Better numbers and price than this excluding the 0-60. In case you were wondering, no one that buys a truck for utility will want a Tesla truck lol. Most people will just buy it because of its badge and brag about its stats and proceed to never use them.

Tesla should call name this truck “flinstone”

Looks absolutely badass af

Like the idea but omg, the design  is 5 years old kid&#39;s drawing

Side view mirrors?
It&#39;s like truck from 1980s sci-fi movie 

Designers: How many curves do we need?Elon Tusk: No
I’m jusT gonna Say it now... ITS A TROLL Release

it looks like a kid drew a car on a paper and it transformed in real life

omg Elon really is the God of morons)

I will never be caught up like a weak minded in all this scam. My Toyota does the job for my ride 24/7 thanks

This thing is as ugly and bad as Ford calling an electric suv a Mustang. Just not right ! It’s obvious they cut costs by not having much of a design team.. it’s much easier and cheaper to make body panels with no curves. Looks like a rolling Refrigerator.

Not for me liberals trying to fix the wheel

This truck looks soo cool. Thanks for the awesome video. Kinda reminds me of a Delorian from the 80s

It&#39;s April fools again?

It looks like a rejected bat mobile

The design of the cybertruck is out of this world. Looking forward to owning one in the future!

Where’s the blinkers?

Designers : How many angles should we give it?Elon Musk : Yes

All those questions I have asked myself, also does it have turn signals? Lol this whole video and not a single second of it showing it has turn signals, many questions

I don’t like the design, it looks ugly.

Love how different it is but too much technology and glass I wouldnt feel safe at all in it

Best boat design ever?
Looks like a space rover

garbage.

Can I get mine in dumpster green?
Designer: So what design for the pick up truck you were going for?Tesla: Yes.

marqass brownie
Can cyber truck rip off the road roller?

What an idiotic design!

I like it!

where tf are the mirrors

ugly as fuck.  looks like a reject from the road warrior.  is this a joke? and the dude who swung that sledge hammer has never lifted a sledge hammer before.  flop-a-doodle-do

am i the only one who think this car is dope

Sounds like Batman&#39;s Tumbler 
hideous

Its just the worst looking car ever

It&#39;s made to be the warthog from halo

Looks like its from an old halo

Mount a machine gun on the back and you got yourself a Halo Warthog

I’ve never liked trucks in my whooooole life, but this, this, I LOVE IT!

<a href="">1:34</a> - I can see jerry rig everything&#39;s headI think

It&#39;s eye-catching, but not necessarily in a good way. It looks almost.. juvenile, like some kid designed it. I&#39;ll pass.

The future is now

Balenciagas are also fing ugly. And now everyone is wearing the damn things 

You were wrong on F-150 towing. The F-150 can tow 13000 pounds with its tow package.

The Cybertruck is awesome! Especially for the amazing price! 

Fyi a f150 is rated for 13 so I don&#39;t know how 13 is half of 14 but sure

Home boy musk anticipates for zombie apocalypse
Omg! Is this vehicle a joke?? Only the too keen to be in the future are gonna buy this POS!!

I don’t like it already only because of the lightsI love trying to drive and being blinded by led lights

i liked the original prototype  they leaked better

Tesla but it&#39;s on PS one

Tesla but it&#39;s on PS one

Desing by &quot;Ebali mi Basi ponti&quot; the price will probably be more expensive than a dozen A class geldings)
Elon is burning to drive such a colossus to the collective farm for potatoes! Give it to the President of the Republic of Belarus, it will at least equal Gelly’s design) Rilly’s design power, in GTA Vice City the designers outplayed it.
Isn’t that the same shape as the Halo Warthog lol

I find the Truck very ugly

Looks like piece of shit and it is if was made  by a welder in our neighborhood, who run out of steel and used iron from rubbish tip nearby.

I like it

Tesla should take this and make a minivan version as well.

<b>Nope.</b>

It’s gonna be good for Police

The f150 tows 13,200lbs btw.

Dope

JUNK.

If you go for the specs and price (of it stays the same) it&#39;s impossible not feel this is something special. 200miles for 40k$ electric vehicle would be already very good. on a pickup this durable is just crazy. I think it will be a success.

More like a death race  truck
camera is bad idea on a truck. it will get dirty..  and you wont see shit in your rear view

I like the overall design, but it can use a little refinement. Especially in the back and the fender flares. The front end looks dope.

hum about ho matche time hate thakes are i have saying ore 3 year&#39;s but maby i have that rong

I really like it so much ! 

He must still be high on weed.   I is an ugly truck.  Im a truck guy.  not for me.. Each there own

is this fake?

Looks just like the cars I used to draw in kindergarten.

they are gowing to tesla chip your eye&#39;s

In practical terms, this form can be very effective. Easy to repair and replace body parts due to its simple shape
Your safety:There safety:Fatalities

i hope he&#39;s pulling off some sonic &quot;we changed the design based on critique&quot; promo thing...

Hi! Im a usual follower thanks for your videos. One question, where are you going to do LASIK eye operation? Recommendations? I want to do it next year but im very worried about where to do it. I would really appreciate it!

This looks like the kinda car we  be makin out of spare legos as a kid.

The look on Mr.Mobile&#39;s face at <a href="">2:08</a> says it all

.

I WUD BUY ONE.... AND ALL THE HATERS... 
When the most respected, world known actors have a string of successes,  and then they choose to do that one movie that sucks like a black hole in space. It ends up being the one that screws their future and nobody forgets it. Big bad mistake Tesla, real bad. 

Uggliest car ever !!!!!
Makes the F-150 look like your grandad&#39;s turd.

C&#39;mon, they can&#39;t be serious. That thing is even too ugly for the military. It would look better if it got in a high speed accident. I think the 1975 VW Thing looks better than this .

Super ugly car

Love it

It s like a box with 4 wheels. All Tesla’s like that. At least make a nice interior and nice interior dash or screen. Well yeah a box with 4 wheels and a monitor I forgot

<a href="">3:45</a> The 2020 F-150 can only tow around half of the purported 14k lbs of the Cybertruck? My 2018 F-150 tows nearly 12k lbs, so that&#39;s a false statement. Just wanted to point that out.

Bro it looks like an AP carrier vehicle from COD or it might be a good PUBG Mobile update?

I am here just to advertise my channel, have a beautiful day, amazing human being who has just read this comment.

No thanks, I don’t my ute to be made out of some recycled bulletproof eco friendly/electrical tin can drawn by a 5 year old me, or just a douchebag who thinks the ugliest car worth is better than a Camry like 15k? And plus why don’t you start by making a nice eco friendly AFFORDABLE sedan

It needs some dual mini guns and it is complete.

more like no DNA from any car in existence

This is very cool I think maybe right
It&#39;s the new Multipla

Nice sheetmetal car.
UGLY .
I want to flex so hard on boomers with the low poly road brick!

The paint job is terrible! 

If dreams come true, I want to be one of the first people on the road with that truck. I like how it looks like nothing on the road

Looks like there trying to make it easier to go to area 51

Finally a truck that can evade enemy radar, just what people need..

Looks awesome

I would buy one. I like the design
It&#39;s not a truck. It&#39;s more of an SUV with a bed.

Ppl will buy it just bc it’s a Tesla.

Imagine running from the police in this thing

But it doesn’t look like a truck

This is the future 

Such an Ugly truck 

Diarrhea
At <a href="">3:07</a> 

I love it. It isn&#39;t pretty. It isn&#39;t what you would expect a truck to look like. I&#39;d buy it just to make people go &quot;what an ugly car!&quot;

This truck has no reflection

That looks like something Lamborghini would come up with for a truck almost, guess its the wedge shape.

GTA in real life

Overrated!

Markass brownlee

That is one ugly car

As a pimp i cant get an opinion about this before i see a lowrider version of it

Looks more like they are trying to sell to the military

Looks ridiculous Pure trash
Sky-net is in waiting....

It looks like a modified SUV version of Lamborghini Reventon in the side view

First the headphone jack and now this. what a great time to be alive :)

Love it or hate it, but everything else looks tame next to it.

My big question is how do you look under the hood? i didnt see a way to pop the hood.

I still think they should have had Sigourney Weaver drive it out on stage, and step out with a pulse rifle in one hand and Newt in the other and a half dozen xenomorphs in the truck bed.

I think this truck is actually hard to control!But anyway as long as it is made by Tesla&#39;s Engineering Methods , finally we have an innovative Design in the industry.the launch power is nerve melting !!??

It could be a &quot;grower&quot; - most people are underwhelmed, appalled, disappointed - but in the right colour - desert beige+brown+black camouflage perhaps - it could be a major sci-fi-now head-turner.  It&#39;s possible Tesla might just be ahead of the trend:  if  the vehicle were to soon feature in a Hollywood blockbuster success it would definitely soar from ugly WTF Duckling to sold-out best-seller. So come on R. Downey Jr. et al - help Elon look like a superhero again guys...Paul G

Your videos suck
ZOMBIES ARE HERE!!!

An Iraqi passed by
Looks like a 3 year old designed it.Doesnt look like the car has any safety  designes planned

Looks like Tesla is trying to go delorean

Tesla found a way to appeal to Americans

If I had the money, I&#39;d definitely have one ordered.

Battery , coke and minecraft = WTF truck ...

The cyber truck is badass and it looks ugly and just something out of this world. Amazing 

a total joke and insult to any qualified industrial designer out there . !

The Tesla Truck is butt ugly...  I would rather have the Rivian E-Truck...

MKBHD: Where do you fall on the spectrum?Also MKBHD: You can&#39;t stay in the middle.

i dont speak english kkk
Looks weird, but I&#39;d still drive it (specifically the triple motor variant). Great performance and eco friendly.

It took me a while, but with a couple design tweaks I am all down for it

It&#39;s official - Elon hates his musk

Haha... is this for real...:D:D:D what a piece of s**t

It looks like a car made from a paint can lol
it’s still rendering
I LOVE IT I can’t see myself driving it now Cuz I’m (14) BUT I feel like when I’m an adult I would buy this ish

RANGE???   I didn&#39;t hear a single word about the number one problem with EVs.No charging stations in the back country

I like it but I feel that I could have some more features in the interior

I love the idea that all this marketing guys with all their consumer reports, focus groups add fear to step a side from copy pasting same design again and again can  suck the rod

Looks so cool
Is a prius only on backwards look (this is a fugly looking vehicle)

wheres the FLUX CAPACITOR!!!

Its a pretty ugly thing.

I preordered that $650,000

Looks dope
This design appears to be an admission from Tesla that they don&#39;t know how to fit curved panels together or do paint in a way that is profitable.When the other car manufacturers catch up to Tesla in the electric car business Tesla is going to get smoked! Look at all the conceptual drawings that everyone producing when they were trying to guess as to what the Tesla truck was going to look like. Those drawings are what people want. None of them were lame like this design. Sorry Tesla. Im selling my stock.

no the glory in failure ‍️
Looks good in traffic.

Oh this actually real

Ugly

Has to be the coolest looking truck I&#39;ve seen, despite the embarrassing window demonstration. The latter reminded me how even very smart people can sometimes do very dumb things. Years ago I was called upon to demonstrate how a long-lasting light-bulb&#39;s filament could withstand considerable vibration. But in my enthusiasm I accidently broke the entire bulb! It makes me feel better that even Elon Musk can sometimes be as stupid as I was then!

I actually like the Design. It&#39;s something new and not as boring. I don&#39;t like the Pickups though. Theyre okay if youre a farmer or something but so many people drive them in the city, block everything and gobble up loads of gas.

Do we need such senseless shit nowadays ?

Now I know the definition of UGLY!!

looks like they tried to render a Delorean on a nintendo 64. THEY MADE IT OUT OF STAINLESS STEEL? talk about not learning from the past...ever seen the crash test footage of a delorean? it&#39;s not pretty. 30mph is enough for the car to completely disintegrate. killing the driver is all but certain. it&#39;s heavy for it&#39;s strength you can&#39;t really paint it and it&#39;s expensive. they figured out it was a bad idea to make a production car out of stainless 40 years ago...but here we are.

Reminds me of a el camino

tell Tesla to make a halo truck and done with it.....

I am not into cars, let alone pick-ups.Great video, I still enjoyed it and found it informational.

Looks like shit

Heard about the reveal on Twitter and thought &quot;WTF&quot; but you know, it&#39;s actually pretty damn cool. If they make an ATV or Dirtbike that charges in the back that would be insane!!!

Careful with those front lights, something is embedded in there!

Ugly machine 
that shit is ugly but alot of people love the nissan cube so people will buy it.

So where is the truck?

It looks like the Logan&#39;s Run hover vehicle

like

It&#39;s like something from a 1980s sci-fi movie for example like a car from back to the future 

If you want a revue on a pickup truck from a guy who doesn’t know anything about pickup trucks then here’s your guy

How much exactly is that piece of metal worth?

looks like it got cut in half!!! ;)

Lupe Fiasco&#39;s brother.

I am a hater

The future isn&#39;t what i expected, but maybe that is what makes it the future.

Ugly as hell!

Mark ass brownlee

Dash looks like marble
Can you imagine busting your fuckin face on that dash? Got damn

Looks cool but they are the lowest reabile cars out their. Not good maybe wait a few years

SO I&#39;m curious do people not like the TRUCK or THIS VIDEO?? why so many unlike/dislikes his just showing us what we could never see unless he did this for us duhhh why y&#39;all hate this guy&#39;s videos cos if its the products then you need to comment shit product or just go to the tesla website and dislike them there or comment your frustrations there but don&#39;t dislike this guy&#39;s awesome helpful videos unless you really mean you don&#39;t like this guy and his videos  kmt...

I decided to love it for the sake of humanity

Kanye West as a vehicle

Looks like some Milton Bradley toy from the early 80s  boooooooooo!!

i have a lot of respect for elon. but this one was reminiscent of my days in first grade where all the boys would draw their own cars and trucks. on the other hand, it does look like you could hit a semi and the semi would be the one with the damage.

It looks like something an amateur welder would make in his garage.

Hello guys! How are you doing today?
Shared DNA??? De Lorean 1980.
Good luck on 10mill
Straight outta roblox!
Musk reminds me of one of them guys on American Greed with a ponzi scheme.  His advertising of this truck  just screams it.

Man!!! I kinda get why you have so many followers. Despite not liking the truck you still made a video that neither bashes it nor praises it. You made it clear at the start that you are not a truck lover and i get the vibe that you hate the design of this truck but still you never came out and said so clearly. Instead, you used other youtubers to express your thoughts by showing their expressions at the unveiling. Kudos man! you may have a  career in politics.

If this is a &quot;truck,&quot; this had to be the ugliest truck Tesla has ever made. Looks like a half- carved toy from a giant block and they just go, &quot;let&#39;s put wheels on it.&quot; I&#39;m sure the interior looks good but the exterior appearance looks as attractive as a block of wood.

<a href="">6:07</a> cookie cutter design? This truck literally is a cookie cutter

the civic <a href="">4:06</a> is still pretty..

Commerce :That how we call it by-product Engineer&#39;s:tat is innovation bruhMedical: its look like operation is still in progressArts: it&#39;s caa...rMinecraft: nice made

The cybertruck is like when the textures don&#39;t load

My initial thoughts are; there will be A LOT of exterior body/light changes.  And Tesla will be 50% military contractor is 5 years.

The yoke steering wheel harkens back to “Kitt” of Knight Rider yore.

The design would feel more balanced if it had one more set of wheels at the back. Otherwise I think you could actually get used to it

That s stupid look. It s like a tank. Does not look luxury at All. Yeah looks like mine craft truck

People like it because it&#39;s from Tesla. If this pickup truck comes from another company, I think people will start complaining about design and so.

I don&#39;t get why people are hating this car, i actually like, the way it looks, it&#39;s original, the way it drives, i&#39;m not a fan of electric cars, but the numbers are very good, specially on the 3 engine version.

This is the whitest black guy ever, no racism

Did anyone notice the sardarji at <a href="">4:47</a>
