Shafaqat Amanat Ali 😯😯😯😯 legend
&quot;Raga Darbari&quot; is a classical Indian musical scale, or raga, known for its majestic and serious mood .The notes and patterns in Raga Darbari create a unique atmosphere, evoking a sense of grandeur and contemplation.

Discovering this underrated masterpiece was like stumbling upon a hidden treasure in the vast sea of music. 🎵 The magic it weaves with its notes transcends indifference, casting a spell of love even upon those who thought they were immune. Who else feels the enchantment? ✨💖
