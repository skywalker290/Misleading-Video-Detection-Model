Wow ranveer Singh &#39;s wife

Checkout the makeup difference 

So beautiful charming dimple smiling face attractive jewellery wondering black dress osam perfect model look
You are Fabulous gergouse stunning absolutely Beautiful ️

She is too boring!

Deepika has a such a fab body but a verrrrryyyyy average stylist who has no taste whatsoever.

God! Deepika&#39;s looks in Love Aaj Kal and Piku were amazing!

proud of you girl

Shaleena styles herself really well, but not Deepika.

You have done a lot in your dressup before but now there is more.
Admit it, she&#39;s more beautiful than Priyanka Chopra.

She is beautiful

very nice ️
I loved yr comment Aishwarya 

Deepika is not street smart and witty like other actresses. But u can tell that she is a good human being at heart. She has been working with staffs for a long tym and the way she supports her staff is something very rare to see in this cut throat beauty business!

Fire the stylists who dressed you for every Met Gala. Always polar opposite and nowhere related to the theme. I&#39;m always disappointed by DP&#39;s Met Gala Looks. I love her as an actress but I gotta be honest.

She is boring..... I love priyanka interviews..... She does not know how to create an ambience..... How to have a stunning personality like priyanka...... It looks she is reading an essay in class.... But she is beautiful no doubt.....

An an....an an....an an...

That&#39;s vibrant and umangous dress was more waggish... 

Don&#39;t like the way she talks... Her ancient is so bad...

You druggi

Happiness family toomamjiandsirji

god she brings up being a badminton player in high-school in every interview without even being asked. Women get over it!

missin my brown color Deepu 

She is so beautiful and gorgeous 

Lovely relashionship between them️
Stylish is more beautiful than the actress 

No fashion sense Deepika

She&#39;s a fusion of Aishwarya Rai and Camila Alves

Dipika u r my heart but Muze tume ek bat Batani hai...  Tum middle line hairstyle mat kiya Karo...  It&#39;s not works on u...

Poor English

This video is basically Deepika and her stylist saying they the bffs in an expanded words form

Lol....Anyone who calls themselves a &quot;philanthropist&quot; is actually just a narcissist.

Yes yes... She like really big bags .... Samajh rage ho.....
She loves to talk about her background. Lol. In every interview,she is talking about her journey. She doesn’t really take the interview topic seriously and talk about her journey 

Dum maaro dum..
Philanthropist?????!!!!!  Lol
It&#39;s worst dressing

Priyanka&#39;s black book is more interesting...Deepika is talking very seriously..

I don&#39;t know how ppl become so fair..

Her stylist looking more beautiful then deepika .

Who is she wearing here? Damn that faux leather top!!

I like more priyanka&#39;s fashion sense

The green color dressed looked awesome. But her headband ruined everything

I don&#39;t like her dressing style
Not good ,,can&#39;t beat with the greatest women P C

Can we appreciate how she says &quot;actor&quot; and not &quot;actress&quot;️

Was it Mallya father-Son that make you model?

I think whatever she wears she make that fashionable

I feel deepikas stylist needs to get fired. She is getting away only cuz deepika is gorgeous!

<a href="">0:14</a> I thought she is Deepika

The murky morning specially escape because drizzle empirically harm between a tall cub. hapless, responsible ghana

Am I the only one who feels that all those oversized clothes do absolutely no justice to her incredibly gorgeous toned figure?? Almost of her looks are about these layers and layers of fabric with a lack of detail..In the words of Bruno Mars &quot;if you&#39;re sexy then flaunt it!&quot;

Deepika
My fav actress 

Have u ever heard selfless ppl like Bill gates calling himself as philanthropist?

Marijuana marijuana
And druggist

I liked the parts of the video where the stylish was talking

She is literally what goddess in human body looks like. .

Should be titled druggies BAZAAR

Deepika pulls out any colour. ....

why do you guys always have to mention her husband in whatever she does. She is her own person. not a reflection of her husband for gods sake

The second-hand income proportionally phone because slope prognostically bleach down a political temper. economic, neat den

Dipika mam please l am a digainar woarkar muje kam cayeye

I didn&#39;t have much choice it was either doctor or engineer or else I would be disowned

Love you deepikapadukone
Deepika 
I have never been literally so bored watching a fashion interview 

I love you so much

Pathetic accent 

Ranveer is not fashion He is fun Means  fun of fashion (nonsence to fashion)

doesnt look into d camera wen she is speaking..seems really nervous

philanthropist?
Today her birthday ️
Deepika 
Better say drugs is your fashion mantra !

The stylist just look like her

Philanthropist... when u broke up with Siddhartha Mallaya bcz u had to pay the bill.. u r outstanding..

but the pink and the green one ..both were ruffles and tulles...thats like repeating same fashion,cut and material over again...just the brand changed and the colour changed...i feel it wasnt smart...i am sorry...i am no one to comment anyways :\

Deepika has experimented a lot with fashion. Like she is so iconic

I love shaleena&#39;s hair color

M extremely happy that ahe evolved her fashion

So err... Who&#39;s the person here responsible for Deepika&#39;s champi look? :3 I&#39;d like to see her.

Don&#39;t like her style sense! She&#39;s gorgeous but can be styled better

Her accent lol.
Ugly

Loved your fashion evolution dp, Just a small suggestion, never introduce yourself as a philanthropist, let others call u by that name. Sounds like your work for society is just a means to make a good impression on others, doesn&#39;t sound like u do it wholeheartedly.

How about deepika guide to her &quot;MAAL&quot; ??

Deepika padukone is the best always 

Report karo nashedi
In this video the NCB guesthouse could be also seen <a href="">0:06</a>

Deepika mam I am biggest fan of your fashion and you

Ganja hai fashion
the fake world of rich n so much money scares me alott...i feel its artificial and never close to nature.we are forgetting ourselves as humans..we bcome robots without feelings..just money

Druggies

Nashedi, “druggy”.

I loves you alot deepika ma&#39;am 
Nonsense... Depikka drug addicts... Banned her from movies and add

Great!

I never heard she ever donated anything when did she became a philanthropist

Nashedi woman
Your smile is amazing pleasee meet me

Every people in the world we love you so much

These people don't let Deepika wear anything...
What the fuck is she wearing

Nashedi dee pi kya
Medicine, scissors,needle and thread.......hmmmm..

Who is here after deepika&#39;s drug case?

At 16 my mother whooped my ass for flunking math in 11th std.

Ganjedi??? Nashedi h maal kha hai ??? :
Pikapika pikapika pikapika,........
Yahi hai voh &quot;shal&quot;. Joh deepika k chats mei mentioned h.   Isko pakado

I cannt hate this beautiful angel She is inspiring to meAnd the point of the green dress is that the way she carried that ️️️️

Unconditional acceptance means True love

I have started Hating her for not supporting Sushant. Her bf snatched Ramleela, padmavat and many movies from SSR.

Actually a simple can be a wow too! Why don&#39;t you guys try more of simplicity something more real? I don&#39;t get it. Fashion is not the end of the world common

This woman has double standards

Red carpet!OMG peacock

oo finally found the stylist who misses all the met gala theme badly

No you were desperate to get into showbiz....you grabbed every opportunity to do so

It&#39;s like it&#39;s not her black book...it&#39;s her stylist who introduced her to fashion......

Wait both of their voices seem similar

Today I learnt that celebrities get styled for their daily lives too, not just during events. :)

She is soo real

I love Dipika 
Fake . She is not a philanthropist.

We all love you deepika
I have been watching her Interviews since forever, and Deepika Padukone is pretty dumb. It&#39;s evident she struggles a lot to speak fluently and smartly with poise.

What makeup does she use I wonder ?? She is dusky and with make up she turns into this white woman ! What is this skin colour alterations.  She does it always. It&#39;s sick

<a href="">0:25</a>   did anyone notice?

I love you mam.. N I&#39;m a big fan Mr. Ranveer Sir... Love you so much...
Who else thought it was more of deepika&#39;s stylist black book then her&#39;s 

The feeling when you see deepika&#39;s stylist wearing same denim jacket as you  have 

dude u forgot to credit Ranveer Singh or her nice but weird looks

Deepika wear worst clothi

Jisko khud faishon ma ata pata nhi vo chali faishon sikhane.Frankly,her clothes are disgusting!!!Dono husband wife ek jaise

Because she is the wife of most fashion experiment  of bollywood ranveer

Oh god! When she starts she never stops speaking 

Dipu please change your stylist

solo holiday at 16 lucky

Hello

Yar deepika ki stylist usi ki trah kyu lagrhi h hair and eyebrows

Tf?

She was dark skinned and now she&#39;s fair skinned? Like wow

I love shaleena nathani

You look like DP sister some how
My parents never sat me down to ask what i wanted to do in my life and even if im 25 now they wont let me go on a solo trip 

Its more of  a stylish and actor Relation  which  makes her and her outfits more elegant and awee

You are not bad
I skipped dipika&#39;s part only to see her designer

I donot find her  graceful.she is just so wanna be

&quot;When you&#39;re 16.. and parents sit you down and ask you what you want to do with your life..&quot; No Deepika.  That&#39;s not how it works. Its more like &quot;You&#39;re 16.. 10th boards are coming.. if you don&#39;t get at least one mark more than your cousin you will be disowned &quot;

Bhabhi ji style ???
Deepika padukone acting very gd omg I like so much 
Soooooo beautiful Deepika padukone just awesome 
Love you Deepika 
But I&#39;m really upset with all of Deepika&#39;s Met Gala looks. They aren&#39;t able to bring out the theme in the best way.

To be honest, deepika has been criticized  a lot of times for her style. There are many photos where she can be seen copying Sonam kapoor and few other celebs. Google it out. So her stylist might be good but she needs another perspective.

Simple, classic and elegant ! She is confused about her own style?

the stylist is also very pretty 

Omg she’s  sooo elegant and Beautiful and her career is  amazing

Everyone in the comment section her stylist is gorgeous.

Her style of clothes and hair was amazing before which are not so good now a days especially since 2 years... before her hairstyles were awesome even in interviews and now even in big events, she is styled champu... pls go through her old interviews during the times of love aajkal.. Chennai express.. race and such movies.. she is beautiful... enhance her beauty with good style of attire and hairs

I look like a rat with a neat middle partition like that.

Having everything in your bag when you go out is such a Indian thing  I am also obsessed with big bags

That green dress ist awful

My favorate ️️️️️️
Boring, Priyanka&#39;s was much more interesting

She looks like Rosario Dawson, Meghan Markle many others coping each other, why the ex Dutchess don&#39;t reveal her Indian or Muslim heritage, the mom uses a nose ring and dreadlocks or is all fabricated for the press and fame.

I love Deepika but I feel like her style is basically so .... confused.

Shes super gorgeous

She&#39;s a Queen

I like her dimple and hair....

When you look at her stylist, you instantly realize she channels her inner sense of fashion in Deepika, her outfit+hairstyle is the same as Deepika, and their personalities match. That&#39;s how a stylist should be.

I love her accent!

Omgg irrfan
Fashion industry seems to be the biggest threat to earth. These people make so much trash, thrown away after one use.

irffan isnt in this world anymore:((

Damn I got shook when she said “Aneela” out loud cuz that’s my name  l ol

Deepika ️️️️️️️️
Never trust a person who calls themselves a &quot;philanthropist&quot;. 

She has been putting Deepika in a copied dreeses from some Hollywood celebs and the best part is Deepika wears it everytime. She simply has no personal sense of style. You just give her the dress she&#39;ll wear it.

Priyanka&#39; s video is more fun

Never less than any Victoria secret Model... or more than humble n charisma<a href="">#D</a>

She is a Lil boring

Looks like Avatar 
You are the beauty queen in the world️

she nails it every time

Glamorous ️
Deepika&#39;s stylist looks like her long lost little sister.

But Ranveer got influenced more.
<a href="">2:20</a> that swag entry

I love your movies and songs deepika padukone

Philanthropist??????what charity you  did??????

My favorite actress

Love you mam
She looks more elegant with black color.

At 0.25 what is that on her underarm area  is it any style?? Really??

Deepika is a beautiful and simple acctress her makup also wow she looks very gorgeous in lehnga chooli.

I know very little about fashion... But she needs to change her her stylist..

PC I’m doing little black book this year 2018  deepika I want do what priyanka did last year 

I love deepika
I want to see her with Ranveer (her husband) more! at least once in an interview!! I want to see The interaction between them! He is amazing too

Philanthropist? Really?

Where is the guide?

I noticed that deepika&#39;s videos arent really &quot;guides&quot; to viewers but a description of her own backgrounds. Nevertheless its interesting.

I wanna know what colour she&#39;s wearing on her lips here!!!

I am a big fan of you deepika

Deepika&#39;s stylist kinda looks like Deepika from some angles

She rocks and looks beautiful in her parted hairstyle but Her hairstylist needs to put more effort into getting her into new hairstyle......i can see her looking stunning in so many hairstyles but everytime I see is the same thing not that it&#39;s bad but would love to see her with free fresh hair looks.

You are a shame deepika padukone
I appreciate that the stylist is given her deserved recognition.. love u both :)

Two of the best ever stylists in Hindi film industry are Anaita and Shaleena. The way our stars look is because of designers and stylists and lets give credit to all those people who work behind the CAMERA !!! Our Hindi film Industry has given thousands and thousands people job !

Queen for a reason

We want Kareena Kapoor Khan

Philanthropist !
I feel , every time you speaks , she talks irrelevant and lost.....

Thank you very beautiful ️️️
What is that orange dress worn at the start? It looks like a Gianbattista Valli dress too 

Dress to impress 

There is a pad shop, there is a lady, there is a tree, there is a letter, I don't know from where.
I don’t know why women are obsessed to look fair  I would much prefer to look tanned than fair

Money changed her skin n choices.she wasnt beautiful in the begining of her career.her complexion was darker n her choices towards fashion was <a href="">normal.money</a> speaks

With all that money, you’d think that she would hire someone to teach her how to articulate properly.

Finally I got the source from where Deepika got that blinking rateOr is it that The stylist got it from Deepika..That seemed like blinking per picosecond 

I won&#39;t be able to idolize her ever coz of how drastically she changed her skin tone

Jhooth Mat Bolo

Both women are so sweet and pretty.

I think her hair was best during Ram Leela promotions

Was this supposed to be a documentary? She comes across as so stiff &amp; controlled!

<a href="">4:09</a> she actually sounds like her lol

I find her stylist more attractive and chic  !!

Nice

I love you  maryam

Please, this woman needs some pep. She is too diplomatic, boring &amp; fake. She is just extremely lucky to get such fame. A bad actress, it&#39;s just Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#39;s favour that she got his movies, mugged up line, got tutored, delivered line with zero expression in eyes  Bad actress, boring attitude &amp; soapy vibe.

Crap.stop it

She is beautiful

What has she done to her skin, lottt of glutathione man!!!

The way she talks is to robotic. Her interviews are pretty boring. She doesn&#39;t seem to talk in a way that connects to the audience.

Why she is so skinny..

I buy the magazine all the time
I love them all
Priyanka&#39;s little black book series was just so much better

Her stylist is gorgeous

I don&#39;t understand why in India models became actors 

Was she this fair always??? Or is it Indian fair and lovely thing????

She is in no doubt beautiful but comes across quite boring and dull. 

Philanthropist?????????
Now a days everyone is a philanthropist

Deepika Padukone is looking incredibly gorgeous 

Please do this with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan [for example, at Cannes 2020?] 

how she became so white ? i am finding it hard to adjust... since for years she never looked like this.

Who is hear.... Subscriber of sherzade shroff channel.... She is sister of anaita

Her stylist looks more like her sister rather than her own sister 

How much money do you earn...
Deepika has ZERO sense of fashion, if she did she wouldn&#39;t be wearing the lavendar gown with the ghoonghat. eew

Always different doesn&#39;t mean good.
Can next one be with haliee stainfeld

It’s not just about work it’s about comfort is literally such a simple sentence but Deepika has to pause, look up, and say it. I just don’t understand why she can’t speak while facing people and just saying what’s on her mind without all the pauses

Her stylists mimicry of Deepika is spot on. “I just bought this because like I thought” !!

Change it hair style !!!

Got bored seeing that hair

The stylist - we want more videos with her ️

Not gonna say much except that.. She is my QUEEN!!!.. Not gonna change..

I think so you should move on.... make your family grow.... this is a step ahead... I never understand why dont these celebrities fed up with the same routine ( makeup , styling , acting, look sexy). Its your life, do what ever you want. God bless you ️

Love u so much....
Deepika needs a better stylist cuz Deepika’s style is always very tacky.

What the fuck.Philanthropy, what have u done for d society u bitch.

ReminderExams are coming
You can learn from her how you hide your self. Never show any one what is in your mind.

Why Deepika is always having same hairstyle... It&#39;s boring 

Pink gown was so bomb 

Awww so cute 
She’s the goddess love you dipu 
Exams on Monday ...
DP ️️ Bestest ever!!
She took fashion sooo seriously that she married Ranveer Singh

I would like to see you in real life once in my life. You are so cool. Love you much Deepika mam.
Deepika first
Deepika is my favorite actress and her style is amazing. I have one small request that we all should try lowering our carbon foot prints. I wonder what do they do with so many dresses after every use. Coz I have never seen any movie star repeating dresses.

Before 50000..

I&#39;m so glad that Harper&#39;s bazar collaborated with deepika padukone.  She is my favourite actor . Such a fine lady

Now I have started to love her ...

Mu queen
Now we want Ranveer Singh in another video please

Wow! &#39;&#39;The journey with her is what I value the most&#39;&#39;... 

Same here Deepika, as to see you evolve, is an inspiration. You did rose from the ashes.  As a fan, I thank you for inspiring me in so many ways, be it mental health, fashion or beauty.  Slaying it as always, be it in airport looks, gowns, or even in jeans and a T-shirt, she rocks in everything she wears.

She doesn&#39;t look good

The most down to earth,real,simple and at the same time talented and stunningly gorgeous of bolywood,very proud of her work on mental health issue through her organization

She a QUEEN

Skin bleaching. 
Who the hell she is ???? Harper bazaars level is so low

Then why don’t I like any of her outfits?!!! 

Love love love love H. E. R ️️
Deepika is beautiful person and also intelligent articulate has excellent family background.

When will these Indian stars that have become global, Educate their community about colorism, feminism and empower women? Not your wardrobe!

So Hot 🆆🆆   ️️️️    
Deepika my love my lifeline my world my everything

 for youhhh
She&#39;s a warrior.

2019 SHE STILL SUCKS AT TALKING ‍️boring asf!!!!
deepika padukone best forever
This woman eases my eyes 

You should switch roles probably because your stylist is gorgeous  but i feel priyanka chopra is still the best but then she does not have that foot in bollywood anymore

When I met deepika, My friends call me &quot;ranveer singh&quot; 

That middle parted hair needs to go ASAP

She is so real love her

Deepika is such an icon️ timeless beauty and always one step ahead x tho I totally think if she wore a lot of Kate Middletons looks she’d pull them off so well!!

queen

Why middle parted hair everytime Deepika? Is this a symbol of your fashion &amp; style evolution ? Do something new about your hair!!

Airport looks are more than perfect infact the best ones, gowns and other outfits during events and interviews are also fabulous, just try and keep on changing the hairstyles that&#39;ll be perfect

Thumbs up for Deepika giving credit where it&#39;s due! She is a fresh of breath air in comparison to Priyanka

SheisSO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
Exam or Deepak’s video my choice is clear 

That white canne cape outfit and the ashi studio gown were littt

Deepika is Love ! She is a beautiful soul  love her 

She is just boring

I was really looking forward to this video!!! I love you so much Deepika.
Seriously fashion and deepika is like Sky and earth . She is stunning but she did almost 100 fashion faux pass . Now she has almost same hairstyle with 100 looks .

Wooowww

Finally found the stylist lol who dresses deepika worst .Deepika you are one of the top star dress like it change your stylist ASAP WORST STYLIST YOU GOT LOL

Queen of bollywood
Deepikaaa ️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She should get a new stylist. Deepkia always has looks that are very similar to looks done before by someone else. Also I don’t think she understands that just cuz a piece is weird doesn’t mean it’s high fashion! 

Deepika Padukone is a style icon.

I think ranveer influenced her to try different things in fashion

Deepu 
Her stylist is more stylish than her 

Fashion is not achieved by applying jasmine tea to hair.
I Am A Deepika Fan..Who Else?  Like
Deepikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You are doing amazingly well....would this continue for long?

She is so beautiful inside out! 

Deepika can make anything she wears look amazing

You both are so precious ️

Awww she has a golden heart and still after becoming the most successful actor of Bollywood, she is working with shaleena that shows how generous she is. love you Deepika

Idk but I&#39;m more interested in the stylist.

Yuvraj singh has bad luck.

Wow!

Her stylist is gorgeous

At 4.08 she spoke exactly like deepika

Boring

Final exams in 4 days but that can wait, Deepika&#39;s style evolution is more important. ‍️

If u Pc fan like
Deepika × Shaleena is 
She is star and salina u are doing great with her ............Deepika love u soo soo much....you are loveable very very very much️

Love you Deepika 
<a href="">6:00</a> she seriously stuns in gowns

I literally never been early  love this

Anyone else supposed to be studying but instead are binging on YouTube vids?‍️
