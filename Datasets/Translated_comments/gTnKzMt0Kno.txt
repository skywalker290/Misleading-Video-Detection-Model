Stupid reporters, kya kitna bada loss poochtha hai? Ask yourself if u lose a dear one how it feels.

Invitation denied for Love Jihad family. The name of the first child is Taimur who plundered India. The name of the second child is Aurangzeb

Can’t believe this 😢 Mighty Allah Akbar ☝️ may forgive you if mighty wants if 🙏

Because I believe it&#39;s because of her and Saif that Rajeev might had to die an untimely early death and others might have known that , hence not allowed ,,,seems a logical reasoning.. personal opinion though..both of them very nasty  .. anyway we all know that these filmstars are totally fake and fully faaaltu🙄

R.I.P. sir
Photographers shout like Kareena maam, Kareena maan, she doesn't even treat people like KUTTEH like PARWA, yet you call people like BESHARAM, Kareena's name. Where there is no respect, one should not work there. The person who fights on the road gets more respect than the photographer. I heard, a photographer was saying that, to give math to the spring logo, to throw a blanket in front of the spring, didn't that photographer know that, because of the spring logo, these logos of the film industry, CROREPATTI were banned, Even today, these people march on the road, and you, the photographers, are such HUSHARI warriors that the entire film industry has been bought by you, but no one gives respect to the people of the film industry. Those people are just mathlabi, you photographers have no respect in the film industry, so die more HUSHARI maths, by saying this you will throw those people out, one day very soon, you people will be out of the film industry. .
One always sees Raza Murad Sahab in every celebrity funeral. Great man!!

And still we stupid people read all this shit

English please

This Kareena Ullu's Path has been written while pregnant.

Now days there isn’t any news from druggiewood. Is almost in the garbadge can. Justice for SSR

Idhar ka log sab medicine per hai hai re baap re
I have turned my back on Bollywood permanently since 14th june 2020

Taimur&#39;s Not allowed came true😭
🌿🌹  And what about SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT ?   All these people have lived their lives. He was a rare jewel...the best in bollywood. Gone too soon just because he was so popular. An icon !!!  Every dog has his day and very soon the initiators of his death and the killers will also have their day ! Just WAIT and WATCH !!!

I don’t care about this old man Everyday people die I feel sorry for those innocent poor people who get killed or die of hunger

Becoz she is bitch

<a href="">#Boycott</a> nepotism is Bollywood

Ayea vatt is a bad spirit 2 brothers died due to her ,

Is this even a news? Zzzz you channels fuss about them for making money and you&#39;re the same one who talks about celebs being so pricy.

RIP Rajiv Kapoor

These people will not come to power...so called media....only during the time of Sushant, the leadership of media and public started.
Dusra khame My darkness
SHE CHOOSE THE MOSLIM FAMILY.  AND THEY HAVE RULES ALSO THE HINDOE FAMILY

May his soul rest in peace. Amen

What did Kareena do that did not help you at all?
Is this a news? Yaar kuchh bhi!

God give Sadgati to Rajiv Bhais soul

Kareena is a ditch sorry for that child to be born to her has done lots of sins to be born to such parents ?????

That’s true so many people are dying in this world what the hell  the media is covering all these morons who trying to show off at the funeral???

Rip Rajiv Kapoor 🙏🙏🙏
Rip🙏🏻
The greedy photographers are calling out to Kareena ji, even in such a sad time, to have some shame...
<a href="">

Is that really worth making as nothing new was shown in it? And kindly note that pregnant ladies prefer not to attend funerals, due to multiple reaosns. Chalo u ko Tau paise mil Gaye na video ke

10 mins video to tell viewers why she couldn&#39;t attend the funeral. 🤦‍♀️

Another n grade Bakwas actor of Bollywood parlok pe chali gay... really sad for his family and friends.

Isn't it Abitaab Bachchan? Brother, may Rajeev Kapoor's soul rest in peace. God bless you.
Absolutely right.
Is anyone allowed in the party🤣🤣
Media ya knewale kuttey

How much does someone feel sad when someone goes away? My Lord has made me feel that all of you are human beings, worshiping the idols made by Hato and bowing down. Why don't you feel the pain of the Lord? Why is there no pain? Why is it that everyone has to go to the Lord? It hurts me to have to answer the questions alone, it hurts the evidence, it's just that the house has entered from one gate to another, man is the world, there are other things, burn it, man feels like this. The dead are given a new body as soon as their soul is destroyed. I have seen this with my own eyes.
Achcha Karishma Kareena felt so sad on herself that tears came out and the rest of you are here. Every day a girl is a halal hote. Hain to me it seems true that you are a murderer. Ho Kareena Kahin, I have sacrificed my uncle's blood for the sake of wealth.
It feels very bad for someone to leave this world.
Idiots thoda to self-respect rakho... Kareena mam kareena mam🤯

Any actor is a human being first.Humans should not make such comments.
ACHCHEY INSAAN THAY DONO BHAI RISHI KAPOOR,,, RAJEEV KAPOOR ..PAR JAANA TO HAIN CHALE GAYE...SECULAR LOGO K LIYE ZAMEEN TANG HO RAHI HAIN

Kareena always support the family no matter what. God bless you kareena.

The Kapoor men don’t live long.

It&#39;s not happy occasion

Please don&#39;t use such background music🙏



i thought kareena had given birth to baby girl. it was on social media last month.

Pregnant lady should not be read...itna nahi pata..
Bad people

Kapoors ko apne zindegi jeene do. Unke peechhe mat jaao, show the world people suffering due to covid, the homeless ones, what govt. is doing for them, show troubles faced by ordinary people, water, electricity, ration, food, internet, any lack of infrastructure. ye sab karo.

But Karina had already had her baby so why not allowed.

Because she is pregnant

Ah really is this news now thousands are dying everyday .Who cares about the Kareena

Kareena is busy in pregnency   Next all india is waiting  Boy wil come out or a girl

bcoz she is pregnant

ab randheer's war...

Too loud music why?

Ridiculously insensitive photographers.......behaving like she&#39;s at some film premier.

Rip

The media is saying no, Kareena's uncle's death has happened and she is shouting at Kareena's mother.

Itna chutiya naa banaao logon ko jis jagha jis se car se karishma our unki mother babita ji utri h wo raj kapoor wife karishna kapoor k death ki video clip h jo edit karke imse dali...
Yes only because she is pregnant

Let&#39;s not bother the family by commenting anything.

Raza Murad Sahab can attend his funeral, he is a human being, he is an actor from Bollywood, Raza Murad Sahab
Late Mr Shashi Kapoor (brother of Raj Kapoor ji) passed away in 2017Late Ms Krishna Raj Kapoor(spouse of Mr Raj Kapoor ji) passed away in 2018Late Ms Ritu Nanda(daughter of Raj Kapoor ji) passed away in Jan 2020Late Mr Rishi Kapoor(son of Raj Kapoor ji) passed away in Apr 2020Now, Late Mr Rajiv Kapoor (son of Raj Kapoor ji) passed away in Feb 2021

Do these reporters paparazzi realize what they say is being recorded n their language is so low class... koi tameez nahi they need to keep their mouths shut at funerals

Best reactions is to give No reactions think about those suffering in REAL world...

Rest in peace.

Any way no more intrested in Bollywood...Om shanthi..🙏

Rip

of course.. Coz Corona cases r still here in India being Pregnant   she needs to stay away from crowded places

<a href="">#Justice4SSR</a><a href="">#Love4SSR</a>

Mountain of sorrow? Idiot, so many people have left India and what has happened to Uttarakhand just now, isn't it sad? Ha...da
Usually Pregnant women do not attend funeral.

Feeling sorry but Sushant death had no reactions from these people all were quiet
