Would like to see what were the best aap ki adalat interviews

I think Bollywood feels that it is necessary to add 5-6 songs in a movie and thus, they add songs with weird lyrics and weird choreography, even though it makes no fricking SENSE!.

Honestly love these kind of vids

ABBG TPOG literally means ae bibiji tea  piyo ji  and IPKI  UPOG  means I peeke aayi you peeyoji

How could even atamaram bhide even say “ hamare zamane ke Gaano me kuch meaning hota ta tha “ when unke zamane ke gaane ese the.

To be very honest, Kal saiyaan gives headache

Hahhahaha

Your voice while singing the songs in the backgroud gave me goosebumps .. More than the video I love your voice... ️ WOW I can hear that voice all day long

I m in a love with ur voice 

&quot;How enthusiastic about cricket is he?&quot;
I think Parveen Babi beats them all with &quot;No Parking&quot; and that was back in the 1970&#39;s/1980&#39;s :D

This is insane. The last one was hilarious

I cannot help smashing the like button.

I love your voice that&#39;s why I watch your videos

Tere bina from damadamm is a masterpiece.but tumhare jaise chutiye kabhi HR ko acknowledge nahi karenge.

I just searched the song from Vijaypath. Thank you Jammy bhaiya for updating my carpool playlist 

Where&#39;s Tony kakkar&#39;s songs???

Fuddu vijaypath song was very popular double meaning song lohru. Tu khud look like a chakka.

Susu

Akahy  got inspiration  of toilet  movie from this song susu  Aa gya  re..

Made me laugh... feel ur pain n how much fun u were having making this video 

Stummping hogayi re 

<b>jamming onto the aksay kumar song only to make others uncomfortable</b> 

You missed Himesh Reshemiya&#39;s &quot;Tandoori Nights&quot; with Urmila Matongar......does anyone smell burnt chicken in the Tandoor??

Love your Hindi accent .. please please do video in Hindi...

I really liked that you didn&#39;t use the songs clip and said the lyrics by yourself. This is really a good idea to avoid copyright strike.

Miss you like mango...no tango... like really!!lol all epic lyrics... i don&#39;t understand how the could waste money on such ridiculous rubbis man!! Sad..

Only video of yours made me laugh

still better than Tiger Sharoff movies 

I can feel your frustration 

Your most funny video ever 

Song of Cheetah (1994) movie - Chu chu chu.....

What about songs of Andaz movie? - (1) - Khada hai, khada hai and (2) - Meri maal gaadi ko dhakka lagao.....

You fotgot barana
the way you speak makes me lose it 

I thought there will be 50 nomination at least

Another gem from another Akshay kumar movie, 12 aana de

&quot;Kal saiya ne aisi ..&quot; After your video I recently researched this song and yar I can&#39;t believe...chhhhhiiii

Hahaha

What about &quot;selfish&quot; from Race 3 ??

Kuuuuuuch too
Cricket enthusiastic song paanchvi ball na jhel paunggee is a really stupid and embarrassing song

Chiti pahaad chade marne ke aaste (from Haseena Maan Jayegi) 
Bro this good song has gone down
Could you please  tell us about the lyrics created  by a certain  P K Mishra I am sure you will find this example interesting From the movie hindustaniTelephone dhun me hansane valee Melbourne machhalee machalane valee Digital me sur hai tarasha, madonna hai ya natasha Jakir hussain tabala too hai kya Sona sona teraa chamake rup salona Sona sona cellular phone tum toh ho naa Computer ko le kar bramha ne rachaya kya

Actually I like kucch na Kano one for its playful inventiveness

&#39;Kal Saiyan ne ese bowling kari&#39; is actually quite thoughtful.  Lmao

bhai ye tu 5-7-10 ye vo hilarious senseless embarrassing moments etc etc videos banata hai...whole bollywood is senseless... even tollywood to complete senseless...koi ek movie bata jisme kuchh sense ho..... pura realistic ho.... ya jisme koi mistake na hua ho.....har movie me kuch na kuch milegahi tuze.... silly mistakes, nonsense, no logic at all.....indian movies are like while receiving an award &quot;yaar humne to action movie banayi thi, pata nai ise best comic movie of the year award kaise mil gaya....&quot;

Movie scenes and songs are shown by the band... Kahar of CopyRight Strike...
Bsdk tu hi sare gane gale

By far the best video 

Content king of today was in his real element in the 90s 

How could you miss Govinda&#39;s &quot;Meri pant bhi sexy&quot; I bet you will laughing and rolling on the floor

Have you ever heard the song Rama Rama.... Where did that golden button of my kurti fall?
There is a very old song worse than ABBGGoes likeC-A-T cat, cat maane billiR-A-T rat, rat maane chuhaDil hai tere panje mei to kya huaaa!!

akshay was always so &quot;CREATIVE&quot; 

Hayeee kitti cricket enthusiast hainna ye  bro this is one of the best videos

Nice work, but you should have added the a bit of those Songs also.

Man couldn&#39;t u add those clips to this video instead of telling us.

Liked your voice and way you sang...

Did you just speaked in marathi between <a href="">2:55</a> to <a href="">3:00</a> how many languages you can speak in total

The way you said what happened and what you did xD
Dude wtf
My God the last couldn&#39;t control laughing first time hearing this kind of stupid song.

Why can&#39;t you add some subtitles so that non Hindi people can understand what is wrong with the song?



Taraaju was not a successfull film .it was a Big disaster at the box office .the film was amongst the slew of box office flops which Akshay did between 1997 and 1999.

Seriously.. I didn&#39;t even know these songs exist on earth 

Kuuuuuuuuuuchhhh bhiiii ️️
Ye apne 2nd tym abbg tpog ko list me dala h. Or sachi btau agr ise child song mana jaye to ye utna bura b nhi h. Jbki list k baki songs horrible h. Khud apki reaction dekh lo

Are yar..original lyrics sunao to...ye information sunana boar lagta hai
There is this song called angoor ka daana hoon, sui na chuba dena from Sanam Bewafa absolutely hilarious

Bro big fan of u r work

The way you read the lyrics made it extremely funny .

People who got crazy on jammy&#39;s cuteness and innocent narration raise your handsToo cute to handle this was...lolHe could have just shown us the songs but no, he just spoke out the lyrics and we loved it so   Very spontaneous and natural narration jammy

The way You spoke was even funnier than the lyrics In love with this channel!!!!!

Wrath 
1. Govinda Karisma song..&quot;main to raste se ja ra..&quot;======&quot;teri nani mari to main kya karoon&quot;---i never understood these lyrics here..2. Hum Saath Saath Hain ABC song was giving me nightmares....matlab kuch bhi..

Your Voiceover is CRINGE!!

It doesn't feel like a slap, sir..It feels like an illogical content..
Ohhhhhhhhhhh Godddddddddddd I&#39;m Dying Because Of Laughing 

You should actually put the song instead of singing

And now I’m looking for these songs  suggestion: to include the songs in your video 

Instead of reading lyrics play the song cuz you reading the lyrics makes it more cringe worthy

I love your voice!!!!
<a href="">03:36</a> that&#39;s my reaction to most of these, uh, lyrics

Brother, that ball was singing to someone else and was moving in that direction.
What is the intro music.. give me name

Your content is soooo good:):) There was one song featuring Akshay Kumar &quot; Jab Tak Rahega Samose main Alu  deta rahunga aoo Meri Shalu &quot; of the movie Mr and Mrs Khiladi... it took away my faith from the lyrics of 90s movie songs



What is this...?
Please make review of Movie Raja of Sanjay Kapoor.I would love to see that

ABBG TPOG

Make a video and share your thoughts on the trend nowadays that has been spreading across India like cancer, and we all know that how it started....some actress makes a comeback into the bollywood spotlight and accuses a well respected actor known for his philanthropic work, for no reason

Song play krte toh maja aate….aise gaa rahe jaise reading newspaper irritating
What???

I was cringing throughout the video.

the list can go up to 100

Dont give reviews if u can&#39;t show the song we don&#39;t see videos to hear your voice only

Wat a voice
No. 1 literally No. 1

Your voice 
&quot;Susu aagaya re.Ja jadi ke piche karke aa.&quot;
For gods sake please, please include more and longer video clips. Not just commentary. I don’t think there will be any copyright issues. And others do it without any issue. You’ll get more subs and the subject matter is spot on. The videos itself speak for themselves.

I don&#39;t know whether to be proud or ashamed that I immidiately recognised the song featured in the thumbnail... xD I mean, it was certainly - - memorable...?

Dude where the hell is khada hai khada hai khada hai

What about Swag se karenge sabka swagat 
Sach mein brain cells fry ho gaye.....

Tandoori nights was awful aswell

Whenever I watch a TRP video (which I often do), I always skip the video to 35-40 seconds and it begins right from there.

Who all are gonna check these songs on YouTube now hit like Here’s the link just in case u need it <a href=""> href=""> href=""> href="">

Zabardast collection hai bhai keep it up kya lyrics hain waaahh BC

You have a sexy nice voice 

If it&#39;s about Bollywood then it&#39;s bound to be either shameless or super illogical. I don&#39;t understand why do we still have hopes with this failed industry  ?

I know the meaning of ABBG TPOG... ABBG = hey suno bibi g... TPOG = Tea (Chaaye) Piyo G... IPKI = Men Pee ke aayi... UPOG... You piyo G.... Lol

Bbg song was cute

Susu aa gaya re
Instead of singing the song yourself, you could play the actual song. That way at least we could judge the songs and not just take your word for it

They are soooo...lol
When you started laughing while reading I lost it 

Uggh the lyrics are Soo cringy 

your voice in Indian language is

Seems like some Rosesh Sarabhai poetry!

Don&#39;t mind! But your voice is so attractive (s##**y)

How many takes did it take you read out the lyrics.

Bollywood should be aptly named Bhaandkhaana.

Matlab kuch bhi 
Anmol u just filled the comment section of ABBG TPOG song&#39;s official video with tags like &#39;TRP Gang&#39; n &#39;Here coz of Tried and Refised Productions&#39;. Seriously go and check der. I found this out in the same way. Comments are hilarious there.

Now i am going to spend my night searching all these songs and listening to them..You are definitely going to increase views on these hilarious songs...

ABBG TPOG has nice innovative lyrics. They actually make sense.

ABBG TPOG is a song from 1953.No need to insult it. People were just having fun with the English alphabet.<a href="#!topic/rec.music.indian.misc/Nou-qHT1JFo">#!topic/rec.music.indian.misc/Nou-qHT1JFo</a>This type of stuff is very old. When I first learnt the English alphabet (around 1953) my uncle told me this. Dr. Kapoor may have heard it 10 years earlier. I remember it asbiibii jii tea pii o jii = bahan jii chhay piopii ke aayii je  = pii kar aayi huu.N

Ur hindi killing me sounds sexy
You forget to mention  tera pyar hukka bar from khiladi 786

Anmol speaking in hindi ??? it's fun ???
OMG. LoL. I have to search these songs as I really can&#39;t believe how the singers had the guts and courage to sing such lyrics!

Jammy make a video on advertisements

Damn.. OBBG TPOG.. IPKI UPOG.. This is smthing i was told whn in 5th std (22yrs ago!!) by a frnd of mine.. Feeling so nostalgic nw.. Hd no idea a song ws md out of this..  Serendipity!!! 

Back then I used to think ABBG TPOG was pretty clever.... but then I grew up

Just 5? All lyrics in Bollywood leave me senseless these days. They have either left to be senseless since K3G or ABCDEFGHI in Hum Saath Saath Hai, the worst film I’ve ever seen.

What am I doing...
Susu aa Gaya re

Apne Saajan ka

Hey Jammy pants, give ur personal opinion on TOH.

Thankfully these are 5 Bollywood songs that I don&#39;t have on my MP3 player. And I have over 100 Bollywood songs on my MP3 player. I am planning on putting more on it. Since Bollywood/Indian music. Is all that I listen to through out most of the year. But thankfully the only real funny Bollywood song I have on my MP3 player is Kuke Kuke Koyaliya. That is one of my favorite workout songs. I don&#39;t know why. But I thought for a minute that song was going to be mention in this video. I am glad that it wasn&#39;t. I just love that song. But thankfully after seeing this video. I have no intentions of listening to these songs.

abhishek bacchan is still finding his place in bollywood

Susu aa gaya re was a straight FU to modiji’s swacch bharat.

Do video on indian movies copied from korean movies

The last song really needs to be appreciated 

still laughing 

Most of the Bollywood songs are senseless....now adays only few songs R meaning full but still it sounds the same like others...Only the golden age of Bollywood songs were good....like the era O Kishore Kumar

Other notable absolute legends-1.choli ke peeche kya hai2.daiyan daiyan3.nibura বাংলবা4.hum to tamboo me bamboo 5.khara hai,khara hai6.dola re,dola re,dola re7.oi Salle,ue ue Alle(shahrukh and pritty zinta8.kothe ​​upper kothri9.a b c d e f g h I10.tinku ji Yann Who among these seems most useless to you and you also come…is in the list
ROFL I Cracked up big time when you sang &quot;Susu As Gaya re&quot; ... And I used to think &quot;Bara Ana dey&quot; was the most horrible lyrics

MATLAB Kuch Bhi*
I just wait for your videos to watch as I find them really well made and interesting,  but you need to get your facts right. The last song is not from Tarazu but Insaaf ,  a movie released same year starring Shilpa Shetty and Akshay which took about 4 yrs to complete. You can check it as I have grown watching this crap during my college days. It was just fun in the 90s.

Abhay, please add the video clip of the song. stupid mistake
Your laugh in-between is annoying.

after listening this i thought selfi mene leli aaj is still better lyrics

Mtlb hadh h

Himesh Reshammiya &amp; Sajid Wajid Are Worst Music Discovery By Salman Khan Because They Have Always Created Only Absurd &amp; Mediocore Songs With Some Meaningless Lyrics!!!!!!They Create These Songs Just For Money &amp; Not For Creativity!!!!!!!

I actually thought you had an orgasam at <a href="">2:53</a> saying those double meaning lyrics 

<a href="">4:00</a> that lyrics made me go for a bathroom break

I'm not kidding
not bolo
Lollllll

How did the lyricist write this type of songs. And how the singers sang these songs

You That&#39;s The Reason Why Despite Having Talented Music Artistes We Cant Win Grammy Awards For Music Because We Always Accepting Mediocore Songs Which Have Meaningless Lyrics In Name Of Bloody Entertainment!!!!!!!

Himesh Reshammiya is better with music than acting

Brother, please talk to me in Hindi.
By far your best video LMAO I died  the commentary was epic!!

Your accent is woww 

Brother you are great
Abbg is a kids song , if you watched the film you will understand. For once I did not like a video of yours.

Bhai... Hats off to you.. Every word you said for Himesh... That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to call &quot;roast&quot; :D .. ek dum balla sahi laga ball pe :D

your voice gives me goosebumps... uffffffff

Mango is another level, man! 

Video topic:Most popular jodis ( Including old ones)

Lol I really got a pee while watching that su su aa gaya re wala part. 

In this video, Jammy Bhai is also a little over-acting...
I died at no.1 
What are you doing man..!! True dialogue bhai
U need to decrease and compress down the audio down of your intro music it&#39;s so annoyingly loud ,it should be close to the decibels of your talking voice . Otherwise very good job keep up the good work

@ Chauthi gendh meh out hui , is it like she saying like she orgasmed on her mans fifth stroke inside her

I laughed a lot thanx....I feel bad for u bro u have to listen to such shit great content as always 

You forgot selfish from race 3

How much overacting will you do :/
As always nice content.
Anu Malik will feel proud after seeing this video 

THIS CHANNEL used to be fun, until isme KKR ka aaatma ghusgaya or overacting karne lagaI still dont understand why he has to make that almost &#39;whispering&#39; sound at the end of every comment&quot;kuch vi&#39; &#39;Main kya kar raha hoon&#39;just go back to doing how you used to do shit :/

Where did this English come from?
Make a classic best emotional movies or acting list eg. Anand , koshish

. Sooooo funnnyyyyy. Loved this video
but i like the song abbg tpog..... acc. to me this song is creative n intelligent

As usual...... Awesome!!!

Meri stumping ho gayi 

Eww....Akshay&#39;s hair in chest. Is he human or gorilla? His chest looks so gross. 

It would have been better if u included vdos of the songs instead of still photographs so that v could listen to them.

Idk why does it make me cringe everytime you talk in Hindi

From where did the blood come out of singing such songs...?????????
 Awesome video
khadha hai khadha hai dvar Par terse ashiq khadha hai and btw Abhishek is still finding his place

isse a6a to humre dada ji  likhte hai

If you&#39;re reading this..I hope you have never heard any of these songs..

Haha awesome Hit like for T&amp;RP 
Can u like also post snippets of the actual songs used? So we know exactly how the songs sound

high on weed or someting else

Himesh is better than da caprio....

You always ask for video ideas at end of the video.. But always copy content of another channels 

ABBG TPOG was a pretty good song according to me though. Try making the lyrics with letters that rhymes with the other poetic lines of the song and with the situation of the movie.

gonna pee laughing at this video..su su aa gaya main kya karoon.. 

I just loved the fact that he himself was laughing so much while singing these horrible songs

Good work keep it up amigo

Brother, you are still in English... Hindi does not sound like Hindi from your mouth
I know it is not easy to come up with unique list. Keep it going. Hope one day my channel can get this kind of reception :)

What to do now?
Please do a collab with cinema beyond entertainment

Ayee Haaye 

O god . U r listening all this to let us know.  . Respect

Salman khan is nothing.. All are watching his shitty movies just bcz he is a star.. Really 

ABBG TPOG 

I actually really liked the ABBG TPOG song ️

Don't sing, my friend...it will be better if you sing...
