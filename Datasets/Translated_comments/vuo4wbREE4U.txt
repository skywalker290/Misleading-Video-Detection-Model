They discussed masculinity when it was not a woke topic. Appreciate it

also men from up bihar and haryana when they come to cities and see modern confident working women with their boyfriends or husband being in love they feel alienated as they haven&#39;t seen anything like that in their villages where women are just an object to shit on them.

haryana and up bihar have men with the most yuck and disgusting mentality these two words i would like to describe them with

I think much of this can be applied to other countries besides India.  We have the same problems

Khan ji, say something about yourself.
please we want this show back

Wished he had invited SRK too

This episode is just amazing ❤❤

Its almost a decade now... but film industry is still making movies like Animal and Kabir singh... And they are getting money...

Amitabh Bachhan is so well spoken. wow

Is Deepika not fluent in Hindi?

We need these types of shows❤

These shows were much better than today&#39;s Sandeep maheshwari shows...... According to my perception....

We need this show back

Some animals have sacrificed the lives of humans 😡😡
Bless the journalist who told the father of his son&#39;s written letter. It helps a lot to know the final wishes of the departed, whether good or bad

My husband did not let me go to my grandmother&#39;s funeral, who raised me after my mother&#39;s death. No body deserves that type of creature as husband.

Kangana Ranaut ❤
Now everything is happening in Reverse 😆

I am so glad that such great shows were there on television when I was a kid (I practically still am)

After 7 years.... Amir Khan is getting married for the third time with an actress who&#39;s younger than him 😅😅

In this show, Deepika didi did not say that I will remember this talk, but in the movie Pathan, your song is there, in my app I remembered this talk,
Please bring back this show... My younger generation need this not animal.

Still bollywood is not awaken about those all issues what they have discussed and making content like besharam rang, gehraai movie, animal movie etc.

I salute true thoughtful message of kamla bhasin mam❤

Who&#39;s here after watching dhruv rathee animal video😂

after watching animal I somehow got a flash back for this episode and came here to check why animal movie was wrong

Plz come back again satyamev jayate 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️
Your situation is next to Yunus AlGohar on Alra TV.
Please restart this show..

Deepika said she&#39;ll be careful. Went ahead and did 4 item songs.

The show is very needed this time....... please bring back this show 🙏 as we can see an increased crime  nowadays at its peak...... society needs to be aware!

And its bad that Deepika Padukone did the Besharam Rang song which was in a bikini or its lyrics were also heard by all 😮
9 years on still no change so many sex contents still

Funny this 3 gals are talking about all this when these gals are so bold doing many intimate scenes

Still watching this.....

Great show

why deepika has nothing to say 😕 she&#39;s only listening 😅

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Super work
Kangana ji is symbol of humanity...❤❤❤
thank you sir : ) i hope satyameva jayate will be back soon

Sir I love you 💖 ❤❤❤❤
Me bhi bare hokar apne samaj ko sacche batayen ge

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ If you don't like this video then what has happened, it is better than 100000000 crore rupees
Amir sir ji beautiful information I like it you 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏
Very good program.very good amirkhan.

5days ago i went out of my house in search of a shop, it was raining and i was looking here and there to check if any shops are opened, it was 6am at the morning. A scooty was right behind me, i thought maybe someone wanted to park his scooty so i didn&#39;t thought of anything else but suddenly that guy he was just right behind me with his scooty and he spanked at me so hard!!! I was shocked!! Didn&#39;t knew what to do,i couldn&#39;t move for a moment, till i realised that i have been harrassed and i have to do something it was to late! That guy passed by me on his scooty, i tried to note his scooty number but my eyes blured out! And also i tried to chase him but i couldn&#39;t. I went back home crying drenched in the rain, feeling helpless and humiliated!

My fiance was also killed in the same way 21 years ago because he never found the land and he didn't know whose family his land would be.
Please satyamev jayate ka naya season leke aaiye

I watched satyamev jayte when I was 11 year old, I want this show again but in the form of digital era, because, dunia kabhi nhi sudharti agar ekk awaz utane wala shant ho jaye to, uske liye lge rehna padta hai 😊 ek na ek din ummed hai ki kuch na kuch to badlega hi <a href="">#satyamevjayteagain</a>

After 8 years, prople need to see this!! Egoistic people just to show their strength unnecessarily harm others. Dont know why people are so aggressive. Its so saddening and scary

This show was genuinely good.❤

Kangana always Answering brilliantly 👍

❤ It was a Great show.

Beautiful episode! Much needed to create awareness in society ❤️

There is no law and rules in pak and ind..

This show was ahead of its time

Kangana 👍
Yes.. Deepika took a lot of care after this. Besharam Rang had already shot this.
Amitabh Bachchan is so true even in the whole industry Abhishek Bachchan is a behaved actor. Never interrupt others matters, Aishwarya chose the right one.

Actually  boys ki upbringing  pe depend karta hai

Start this program again Amir khan ji

Watching in 2023 and want to back 🎉🎉satyamev jayte ❤❤

<a href="">1:06:09</a> Deepika Padukone is lying. Today's movie example is Film - Look in Pathan's song <a href="">#pathaansong</a> 😢 😢😢😢😢
Everyone is saying bad things to Deepika, my brother, if you work then Kangna would have talked about what level with Munawwar in your show or what happened in the gangster movie, what happened in fashion. Look at Deepika's path, look at Aamir. Your promotion is going on, all these fools are fools, they will get money, all will be clouds.. follow your conscious army 🪖 Subhash Bose Buddha Krishna please
Mere Bhatije ka 12 May  2023 pr PUNE mein job krte hue Murder  huaReason  till now  unknown

Movies can also make Positive impact very intensely that is also a Positive side of film 🎥

Love their way  Kangana voiced her  thoughts.She is so elequent. Proud of her ❤

And make pk1, pk2, plk3, no need to put curtain.
This video is very powerful everyone must see this

Kamla ji is one of the gem 💎 she can explain any thing easily and Sha has vast knowledge as well. Pls start the season 3 without Amir Khan pic someone else he don&#39;t deserve it.

sir please season 4 soon.....m waiting..you have done a great job...
It must be restart.  🙏

Sir, now there are many students who are in depression because of their family members. Many parents' It is like that, the parents have cheated in front of their children. The parents do not even know what impact it has on their children. Then the children get their mind made up in such a way that they are 0 away from being the topper in the class. And also many students are like this. They think that their parents are right but in reality their parents are wrong. Only when students will understand that their parents are wrong, they will be able to get out of depression. Because I have seen many such children that their depression is only caused by the parents.
Sir, the face of students' hooliganism is their parents, but it is better to ignore the crime than to commit the crime.
Deepika Padukone, how many videos have you shown to Pathan, what are you talking about?
Comrade Kamla 🌹
The reason we need TOP G

the whole concept was presented very wisely and in a very much convincing order, I greatly appreciate and from the core of my heart, want to have such awareness programs more frequently  in both of the countries; India and Pakistan as we are in dire need to understand the value of humanity. hats off to Amir Khan for this show.

We want it back

Lol deepika🙄you shouldn’t have said that.

2023🍁
Please give the link of the episode on Triple Talaq and Halala.
Deepika is clearly out of box with almost zero inputs..that&#39;s why education plays an important role.

think about the fearless color
took
Deepika has taken great care of what she has learned from her.😊
Deepika's eyes were opened, it was after being in the show, that's why she showed me naked in the TV show, and also did some sexy movies. I hate blindfold in Deepika. At least the chanting is also done.
Wow Kangana❤...even Pariniti very intelligent and responsible at their talk👏👏...Dipika is almost dumb in such conversations, more because she is opportunist bug instead of any responsible figure 👎...see her avataar in Pathan... Simply Besharam! ...... besides, Amir&#39;s every effort, gestures are very praiseworthy indeed👏👏

In the start as they were cutting things from the list that men don&#39;t have this and that I want to clarify that I&#39;ve seen many men and women both having all those attributes so you cannot make a generalistion based on gender.

deepika&#39;s humbleness and accepting the fact that she was not that aware, is commendable .

n still deepika doing the same think

We so need satyamev jayate back

Amir Khan can never dare to talk about halala ,triple talak,Taliban and genocide of Kashmiri hindus

Came to watch just because of KRThe Queen 👑

....... You have noted the situation in a few months in which a person was killed, what did you do on that day, this bad incident is just an accident? Synchronous accident happened that day and in 99 accidents people may have saved humanity by helping another but you have put us in the routine of accidents, however at one time someone spent money from his pocket. Yes, someone may have spoiled his own hair with someone else's blood, someone may have put a wound in his car and taken him to the hospital or his car may have been dirty, remember one thing, if there is too much mention of evil. Will you get the fill of evil or will you become angry if there is more mention of evil?
Just so appropriate to illustrate what notions are associated to masculinity in the Indian society.

The fact that even after 8 years 75% films r still same nd even degraded bt  I appreciate tht atleast these 4 stars took it srsly nd try to sync it in films

After attending this show Deepika dancing on &quot;besharam rang &quot; hypocrisy ki vi sima hoti hai 😅😅😅😅😅

<a href="">19:33</a> 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
very nice soch .Thanks for bringing up these kinds of truth revealing episodes

Worth watching. You covered a topic that is a dire need of our world.

By not talking about men's problems, this evil feminism is still going on.
Look at all kangana&#39;s answers , so mature, to the point, thoughtful.

Amir khan has done the best work to discuss about all these sensitive topics.

One thing i noticeed in thus video Deepika is a good listener....

Yes men are very aggressive!! At home on the road colleges !! The parents has to teach their sons calmness peace and manners

I came here for those actresses but going out as a very different mind set

And yes never to make her realize the whole time about her past if she changed

I believe a definition of a true man is if we as a woman can accept their past even if they had with a lot of girls but he&#39;s willing to change for you and never to repeat again after you being with that person in a relationship if we women can do that I think men have to leave the ego when it comes to accepting a girl with a bad past including her relationship with men in the past if she dedicates her whole life for you change yourself for you leave all the past behind me become a good person that should matter and also she should respect if she respects you and loves you takes care of you and your family that&#39;s I think it&#39;s more commendable you cannot have ego and love because you go in love is like water and oil they cannot go along with each other they are separate.

Deepika ji is silent because she has not improved yet she is doing movies like Pathan or Gehraiyan
mulla naeem khan attacked laxmi, and she lived in mulla dominated area too as she described khan market, that&#39;s why no one helped the maal e ganimat girl. moral of story, be organised against mullas and katwas.

Here Deepika said that in the future I will pay attention to all these things but the same thing recently you did such a revealing costume in your movie, in the song of Pathan movie, what did you learn from Didi?
Only for kangana ❤️♥️
Huge respect to kangana 🔥🔥🔥
Yet Deepika is still doing the same 🤷

Deepika is so dumb.. kangana sounds intelligent n parineeti talks about reality..

Who wants this show should be continued further

You won’t believe that I was just watching a movie call table 21 and that movie is about Rougin in the school and college has had a look what you just came up watching Amir Khan episode about riding in the school college

<a href="">1:05:40</a> to <a href="">1:06:30</a> Now after 8 years also Doing the same thing Deepika, one should not be this much ignorant.

Only Deepika took it seriously and made a movie on acid attack &quot;Chappak&quot;

I was late to the party to watching satyamev jayate cuz Hindi ain’t my first language. But after seeing post that it was one of the most genuine and authentic shows I have ever seen…

Such an increadible show it was !! It stroke initiation of taboo topics like child abuse , sexual Harrasment in Pakistan too .. Kudos to Amir for his contribution to Indian Ceneima and Panni foundation

Thanks

This is first time I am feeling really &quot;jealous&quot; from India as a Pakistani. Because if this continues, then it will really take India to the heights of development and prosperity very very fast.But it was really shocking to me when Deepika said that she didn&#39;t know that movies have such an impact.Amir khan and Kangana, it&#39;s really high of you for accepting the mistakes so openly.And that old lady, Kamla, she has such an accurate, true perspective. She is my real heroin.

Do you remember this episode of teen actress? Do you remember this episode?
Kamla is going to raise her legs.
How much has Kangana changed now?
@<a href="">58:27</a>but  he  DOES  COMEDY  through  his  DANCE ... makes  audience  LAUGH ... it&#39;s  a  TALENT ...@<a href="">1:02:38</a>  in  my  case .. my  parents  NEVER  ALLOWED  me  to  go  to  school  on  a  bicycle ... i  used  to  go  to  school  in  a  META - DOOR ...  😂🤣😅boys  used  to  bully  me  even  then ...  😿

Ye bomoby not myri jan
Amir Khan is getting divorced in old age, peeking into the background
big things, big things
🤣 @<a href="">6:08</a>
Dhoti indein sab yeshi hota hye
Need this show , freshly

That's what Kangna says after taking advantage.
What kind of country is this, what kind of animal are we?😭
Wow.

Sir Zabardast Allah bless you Ameen
Everyone is a little hotter
The thing is that 80 % of people including girls think of toxic masculinity as cool but nonetheless we need to stay away from it

Pavan honesty
Or Rahi Jang ki BAAT to wo na Sirf Muslim mard kary gy Muslim ortain be kary gi in shaa Allah

Allahumdulliah for being Pakistani and Muslim 😌😌😌😌😌 Pakistan ky mard muslman hn Iman Waly hn to Tum sab sy achy hn

All the female actors in this video have given a fake opinion. Total hypocrite

Start the show again ✌️🖤
<a href="">52:00</a>  min what a lines 👏👌

I miss those golden Old days when such social issues were used to discussed on TV. Now News is no less than Comedy and serials. <a href="">#Woh</a> bure din hi lauta do

<b>SOYBOYS!!!</b><b>CVCKS</b>

Sir, it is not true that you made people aware.
This show was the best thing ever aired on Indian tv.

I loved that while talking about the Cinema Part Amir Khan did not exclude his movies and songs which shows that he takes accountability for his previous works which is a very good sign of a beautiful human being!

Amir Khan you are absolutely Amazing and all your programmes are Absolutely Amazing too. Lots of things that are going on in our life should be changed in order to make the difference in the world. Love and Respect from London and Pakistan 😍 🇵🇰 ❤ ♥

<a href="">1:01:51</a> accepting your own mistake is a great thing that most people don&#39;t do

Old thinking films should be banned!

Dont show old films on tv, as shown in this episode!

Aamir bhai don&#39;t play the game for those how are hhey suffering this problem plzz...aapki baat koi nhi manega

Everything is drama brother...
just like movies tell men what girl&#39;s like,,, they also influence what girls should like about boys as well...

Aamir you are still making such movies

Those who love girls, this is the proof of their arrogance...when someone caresses their sister, they get scared and then they feel...
Ma uttrakhand police .hu sir bhut control karta hu.jab asa case ata ha.nhi to asa karna vala ko goli mar data.kas kar sat girls ka

35per sent

salute from heart amir bhai
This show Bharat is very important please start the next show soon sir
Please next show I request

The larkiya also kills the lark on the line.
This is not masculinity,but the misconception of masculinity 😡

All these actresses' dramas are forgotten after coming on <a href="">hai.Show</a>. They only want money and publicity.
If there is a lot of difference in real life in the film. As this print says, then you should show what happens in real life. And what you do should be shown in the film. These are the guidelines given to the understanding.
Deepika ka &quot;you know&quot; &quot;you know&quot; me hi khatam ho gaya bolna... And she still did items songs after this...

I appreciate the men who are being so honest. It takes courage to accept. A narcissistic can never do that.

Now the dog is not coming
There is no account of a man
Mardaani ki baatein nahi jaati
So guds

Sir please es show ko vapis chlayie🙏

<a href="">49:50</a> the old lady&#39;s point of view is also very true and thoughtful.. We haven&#39;t seen suicide of female farmers...

<a href="">1:02:11</a> whatever parineeti said I have experienced the same and trust me it feels like a rape.. Relating the events happening in life with movie is another thing but vice versa is not really good experience to have.. In my case the boy was so powerful and smart he made the scenario look like he is doing this because he loves me..The boy was ideal man for all other people and someone who respects women who knew him so no one was ready to understand my point of view..It was the nightmare for me and people need to understand this thing that sometimes person can be a good human being for whole world but at the same time he can be the worst partner to other person.. And I guess at the end ladke ko ladki nahi uska jism milta hai.. I am still trying to move on with everything happened with me.. The only lesson I took from this is marriage relationship all these things are not meant for me..

Kangna is best

Idw illogical dramas keep on going for years and meaningfull shows like these can&#39;t have more seasons

)

Kangna, Deepika and others never did sex scenes.
But not all men are same

Shusil Kumar Kash watched this episode and started writing it.
This show actually Gives knowledge More than Schools and So called books. But nowdays in our new generation, There is no value of gold and teachingsIf god sees us equal Then why can&#39;t we. Men And woman are totally equal... God invested equal time to Give us birth..

Kamla Bhasin mam just rocked it!

This show should start again
These 3 ladies are sitting here, now they are true to their cause, Ghatiya based films are still banned.
Amazing sir god bless you for this great mission.

Laxmi is the very brave girl 🙅🏻‍♀

Who the hell can dislike such awareness program😡😡😠😠🤬

Same old male bashing.

Amir you are doing nice job, be honest to your self and call your both x-wifes and let them speak openly.

Sir ye topic bhut accha tha

<a href="">59:25</a> so you see here , amir sir too regrets his past films

According to Bollywood love starts with molestation.

Cutie Kangana
<a href="">15:40</a> aapko case fight krna tha thik se

Kangna jhut bol rahe hain....

Seeing these heroines we are scared of men, and here these heroines have become innocent children. I am not going to tell you how romance happens in today's pictures. Ishaaraon mein baatein aur next scene on the bed. Now I am not going to tell you what I did before taking the girl to bed, so we can learn how to impress the girl. After all we all suffer from these films. This time we will defeat such hypocrites celebrities.
After 6 year of uploading this video the view is 3 millon viiew and  item songs  in few months are like munni badna hue getting 100 million  Hence Proved,RIP to the Indian  society and its belief

<a href="">51:50</a>

Satymevjayte frse should start hona 🤞🤞
<a href="">5:43</a> isko kisne item bola mujhe milwao usse.. this is so damn stereotypical.

I don&#39;t why ppl come up with &quot;not all men.....&quot;, But reality is there are enough men in this country who suppress women and think they are inferior, the good ones are very less, so instead of saying &quot;not all men are bad&quot;, we must say &quot;we have enough men to make a woman feel unsafe&quot;

There is a lot of difference between today's Kangana and TB's Kangana.
Deepika did not say much but whatever she said was very good.
<a href="">01:01:00</a> I'm not sure what to do
<a href="">59:30</a> I&#39;m glad that amir khan included his film also.And his apology <a href="">1:01:35</a> Great.And that&#39;s y now aamir khan is so selective towards signing his movies

I feel this show must go on star network must restart this show again 🙏

Amir khan true gem💎i hope firse ye show start ho ❤️💟 star plus bakchod serial bna na bnd kro or Satyamev Jayate firse shuru kro netflix or amazon prime sbb fail hai Satyamev jayte k samne
I think Satyamev jayte 2 ana chahiy New issues new thoughts
Kangana Ranaut looks like an Indian 🙄
In our Punjab, killing even the simplest person over small matters is very bad punjab very very bad punjab.
Punjab police very brutal very bad person no manner
Love

throwback to when kangana talk sense

These papiyo's names and faces should also be shown.
Stop big boss.......... Continue this show👊👊👊👊
this show is way better than bigg boss!

Now I went to Pakistan and did not watch the movies like India. Why do we show women like this?
Shit Kangna!! You have ruined yourself for political opportunism..

Dipika mam is very humble and pure heart

Look at Deepika she has no sence ...look at her expression ..she must feel kitana tough hai exam ...she has no sencs

This is absolutely an amazing serial which you had start Aamir ji ☺️🙏 words can’t describe you how much deep respect I have for you ☺️❤️❤️❤️

Then he goes and play in a movie like thug of hindustan

Wow movie&#39;s toh aisi thi. bt one more thing I want to add, aur kuch bacha tha toh aaj web series chal rahi haiGhatiya... Ye industry kabhi nhi badal sakti .......Nd no one is real here expect Amir khaan sahab.

Gar ma sachu kahiye to bi kem trust nai karta che tamari pase  ....Bahu kaiye to bi faltu bijani....Bolo samir che javab

Sad to know that even after this program, item numbers, semi nude songs with women just dancing are still being made and people still appreciate

Nowadays  kangana is hypocrite

Boht shi ❤️🙏
Kangana making sense it so surprising
So true.....if boys were to take care of house like girls then both girls and boys can share responsibility and achieve progress....I wish parents would treat them equally so there is no place for inequality.....thank you aamir khan for motivating show....some scenes gave me tears ....

If you tell the truth, the light of humility resides in the heart itself, the promise of peace is worshiped only by the one who has the power to win. The world worships tolerance, forgiveness and mercy only when the mirror of strength shines behind it.
Yeah..films does affect the thinking of people bt cant we  just use our brain to distinguish between reel and real nd also right and wrong..??!!

What about Har Funn Mowla, sir?Isn&#39;t it objectifying women?Such hypocrisy, wow man!All Bollywood actors or actresses are more or less hypocrites. Its the actual truth!

@amirkhan

Kangana's opening is always unique or hatke hota

that ragging story was too painful. the victim should get justice! the pain he must have felt at the end, must have been really unbearable. that letter broke my heart. nobody deserves that

Few yrs back we have time n mind to  witness these talk shows......now a days pheww

Kamla bhasin.....what a sense of humour u have

Luxmi u r too cute....gladly i saw chhapak in theatre......i adore u cherish u.....how brave u r....love u

I am a pediatrician....mbbs batch 08...I witnessed ragging...like bullying scolding badly from seniors...but in boys it was very bad as i heard from them...This is not the way of interaction...senior junior is not that imp....respect is imp work is imp time is imp life is imp...what i assume today

We need this kind of show now a days

I just cried 😭 father n son

Big big big shout out to AMIR for this !!!

Today I saw this because it was trending on Twitter and my respect for kangana really rose more than ever she has been these things for so many years now

Aamir, Deepika and Parinati are all such fake people.  They never did or followed whatever they said.  Kangana is the only one who has taken a stand and stuck to it.  Kudos to Kangana.

Who&#39;s here after Kangana Ranaut&#39;s tweet? Let me know

only legends watches satyamevjayate

<a href="">42:39</a> she is still beautiful

Women say that men should not let out their emotions and when these emotions bottle up and men get violent then they blame men for all the problems in society and spread misandry

If you have self control the all these negative qualities can help you rule the world <a href="">9:45</a>

<a href="">1:09:10</a> ranveer (easter eggs)
Masculinity is not the problem the problem is masculinity being used in wrong places. Instead of using aggression and violence against a helpless person, that aggression and violence can (and is) used to protect our borders, freedoms and citizens.

All fault are in parents what you teach , what you get.nowadays most of man satisfying there ego through fighting

Many films show stalking and harrassment as &quot;romance&quot; (not only Bollywood but some even some regional films). This has been happening since a long time and unfortunately still persists. 😔

aamir Sir please aap phir se ye show start kar dijiye🙏

Kangana is really intelligent and insightful amd deepika is just a dumb

Kangana ma&#39;am you are such a great lady ❤👏

And the dead do not feel pain =_= I am angry =_=
Love you lakshmi didi
<a href=""> subcribe karo channel ko aur jitto
Amir khan is real hero,

In the end its the women who happen to contribute a lot in the upbringing of men, if a mother teach his child how to behave these problems they are facing now will be a matter of past.

When is the next episode of Satyamev Jayate starting, I also want to participate.
More than half of the population is spoiled by watching films.
if that is the case then why don&#39;t these stars stop making such movies?

Yes women help the man and the man is great 👍 👏
I am very very sad for the two aggrieved parents and many like them. Indian people,  be humble and friendly. Make your society a peaceful one. And do not watch movies showing violence. They have a psychological effect. Sympathies from Pakistan

Didn&#39;t Aamir khan perform in an item song in the Thugs of Hindostan movie after this?

And yes ye sachh h qki ladkiya Jo pdhti ni h ya phr pdh likhe jo sirf ye sikhti h agr husbnad pite to okk ye kam h hmara and yes m papni bat ni rkh apni meji se shadi ni kr skti wo vevkuf h sb or isilie ye This is the reason why the girl seems to be a virgin but what did the boy say that she is not smart or that's why she got married to a poor person.
Yes, it is true that our wisdom or our passion has ruined our children or it is because of our greed to give it to them that we have sex with a girl. It is a saying that a boy has 7 doors or even cares about which he has to go to the kitchen. Daughter, I don't know what will happen to the girl, what will happen to the girl, what will happen if someone rapes her, but the girl will be hurt by her mistake, she will be hurt by this society. My heart is full of people
My Opinion about Musculanity: Allah has made men powerful by being close to women (Physically and emotionally) That's why I want to pass leadership qualities of MARD. I would like to share in this sequence: 1) For my family (means of food, water, shelter, Daughter's marriage, taking care of her needs) 2) For his family (to keep his family alive) 3) For the community (to help everyone as much as he can)
<a href="">7:46</a> Wow Aunty has said a great thing 👍👍
Theres big difference in reality and what we see in movies.. And I m glad Aamir khan sir accepted that in front of everyone and that&#39;s the quality of a man and hats off to this show for bringing this into limelight.. People need to understand the fact that movies are only and only for entertainment purpose and nothing else so as an individual u should be able to differentiate between a movie and real life..

Yaar ye bohot hi bhayanak hai hamare country me.. Matlab koi kisi ki jaan le leta hai for no reason aur fir bhi wo bail pe chhuta jata hai and then judge bhi bolta hai chalo kuch compensation lelo tum aur niptao bat ko..What the hell man...comlensate krna hai to Akash ki jaan vapas kr do yaar uske ma baap ka to socho thoda..  I m still crying after watching this in 2021..Woww our Great Country.. life is very very unfair to some people.!!

Wonderful seeing again n again. Once more Satyamev jayte

The daughter of a great father took care of the son of a poor man.
The police was arrested and this is the video main.
Ohh my God......I am very disappointed humanity 🥺🥺no words

Mujhe to abrar ki yad agya.... bangladesh parbhi asi hoti he.... abrar ko bhi senior students ne mardala....nd puri bangladesh par jitni ma thi usdin roia tha....😭😭

1.6 k dislikes... Idk why.. Maybe the rotten part of the society starts with this

So sad 😭😭
This show should come back....we desperately need at this time.

Bs Kangana he ab cheap item songs ni bana ri, Baki Deepika aur Parineeti to bs bolne k liye h...

why are women allowed to speak about Masculinity, How they can speak on being a man but we can&#39;t about how to be a girl. And there&#39;s nothing wrong about Masculinity . U can&#39;t prove ur Point by saying some right points irrelevant to topic

What a great show with excellent messaging for the society - there is a lot of learning in this show to improve the society&#39;s behavior - please continue show like this as it is very much needed.

This show is only for women, man has been defamed in it.
There are actresses who have not done item songs like kalki, Radhika Apte, richa chadda etcThese people don&#39;t get enough of recognition because obviously they didn&#39;t do item songs. Hypocritical society!

I am waiting for season 4

Kamla Bhasins comment about honor was spot on!

I love satyamev jayate show and I want this episode to be translated in pushto and Persian languages but I don&#39;t know if it is possible or no, because I can&#39;t do it by myself and I thought if there is any translator app through which we can do it, and is it legal dubbing of this video or no, is there anyone to guide me please  !?!?!

It's been 6 years now but even today nothing has changed in the main movie.
Please bring more sessions I m missing

Pls again start to this show

Aamir should call Salman khan for footpath accident

Agar mard itne hi nikkame aur nalayak hai to shaadi mat karo na koi jabardasti thodi karega shaadi aplogo se kyun bhai log mard to emotionally weak hote hai

Kangana is most  intelligent

Satyamev Jayate is derived from Manduk Upnishad.
Yes, there is only one difference between female males and females, apart from the fact that only girls have to do household chores, or only one or a boy in a house takes them, what is the injustice when it comes to siblings of the same age. What is the purpose of a girl's house or just keeping a boy in bed? If a girl does this then what is the purpose of a boy's house, why should we do this, why are our parents responsible for this discrimination?
In the comments everyone took the name of Kangana who was just trying to clean up her old roles but Kamla ji explained that no one wants to talk about her because she is not a celebrity and then said that nepotism happens in Bollywood.
Say today.
Seha baat chae. Ek ta assurance chahi. Insurance ta khatam aae. Pairs

Mr. Triveni&#39;s story was riveting. You don&#39;t know what can go through the mind of a child.

Sir aap apna channel again start kare our lot of love with u forever

masculinity is nothing but a prison

Deepika weed fuk ke bethi h

Kangana always stand out ❤️

What is Deepika doing in Druggist Satyamev?
This show should be restarted this is the show that can change people thinking

The year is 2020 and Kangana is still  same.... Queen

So sad to see the state of Indian society even in 2020 . So glad Aamir is shining a light on these issues

Look at that druggie Deepika. Soon she will be in a jail.

Do you ever support a public opinion law?
name those fuckers who killed the boy.

Inhone tho sare kuch marde ko galat bta diya sab kuch yahi log Kar rahe hai

Now Aamir Khan said that he likes a big woman, he is doing power, he is showing me now in whose ass he got angry...
Dono kanagana k aage stupid hi lag rhi hain... Kangana is beauty with brain 🧠 👏🏻👏🏻😊...and Aamir ji ab Kaha hain aapke views “it’s high time  ki hum acha content dikhaae and apne aage ki generation ko acha sikhaae” ? Now where are these fake views... parineeta ji kya baat kahi h... drug mafia ko btaane me kanagana lagi hui h or Tum log usko support tk nhi krre ho.. shame on you and you all are fake..

Dono Kanagana k age stupid hi lag rhi hain... Kangana is beauty with brain 🧠 👏🏻👏🏻😊
Every filmmaker while making films should keep in mind as though they&#39;re going to first make their children watch. And there the negative things in the film will be realised by them

Pura show me itne important and sensitive topics pe baat huaAnd people be like kangana, kangana kangana S<a href="">#it</a>
Manhood does not diminish even if strong words are not for men. A real man is one who does not commit adultery.
Amir is best khan

Good leckcher sir

Porineeta Chopra only can make fool.nothing else

What is the reason behind giving money to LDKO in the beginning, the girl remains silent no matter what she says… MARD does not happen, that does not happen… IF MARD DOES NOT HOTE TOH INDIA GHULAAM HAS REMAINED OF MUGHALS AND ENGLISH.
Watching in 21 August 2020So Deepika is giving so Bitchy looks while kangana is talking on the point Deepika is keeping mum and just listening and watching them she doesn&#39;t speak on such issues openly back then also We ignored kangana for a very long time now watching old interview realisation has come Deepika needs to use her voice in right direction and stop doing item songs too bitch🙄

Hats off to Kangana Ranaut for your brave and sincere efforts to make the society aware about hidden truths of this glamour world More respect to you for SSR support 🙏

I don&#39;t think anybody is this perfect like you are saying Mr. Amitabh. In any household there&#39;s no husband who don&#39;t scold their wife and there&#39;s no father who don&#39;t scold their child and even beat them to teach them discipline when they are wrong( Because children are naughty and they don&#39;t listen to anyone) . When you said you never laid a hand on your children..I don&#39;t know how you are teaching your children . Please teach me also

I feel bad for Lakshmi, whose face was burnt by acid - that man who threw acid on her should be castrated and the woman who helped that boy should be hanged. Are you kidding me? What kind of uncivilized society do we live in? That boy who threw acid got married - seriously, are you kidding me?

What do you do chacha...what do women do to...mahabharat or ramayan...dont blame men for evry issues...
Sir Amir KhnaIts I thought a great programme to unfold actual thing but now this show Why u dont ask a middle class man to say how he fight and whole life he spend to do so without any complaint For him family and respect only he is maintaining Please dont do everything for trp please

Kangana Ranaut is so talented..
Amir khan r u like amir siddiqi i think...!

Abe agar Indian men m these qualities n hoti to India m women's condition like European countries hoti aur kya tb aapko hai hain India m discipline haiii.....Aamir sir baat ektrfa nahi chahiye...!
Hello Aamir, today I saw your episode about old parents  about money. In short hame childhood se sikhaya jata hai parents are our next to god and it’s true in some cases. How about if parents are opposite of god I don’t want to use any bad words. In that case what is your opinion how you handle oh I just forgot you also left your kids and wife. Never mind

Despite of that Deepika did lovely and Raabta, parineeti did jaane man aah. Hypocrites

Onlike karne wale ki

No means no
oh no there is not  a single comment on the family go through trauma .shit to all

the family that accepts a filthy criminal like this would not be a human in humanity ,if this the root cause of everything then I really proud to be the supporter of feminism .

is it just me..or this entire episode is highly biased..

Deepika Padukone&#39;s must look at her statement once again ..... after this interview she has a super hit song &quot;lovely &quot;don&#39;t know why people talk such things when they can&#39;t say

Mam historical lines <a href="">48:10</a> to <a href="">48:20</a> 💑👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Historical lines 48 :08 your manhood .Then instead of loving power 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👫
No mention of any Muslim man
Wrong...  Girls bas unse hi impress hoti hai Jiske pass paisa ,power and personality hoti hai...  Hum jaise toh life long single hi rehte hai

Kse beju

Sir I want to send you videos
Kanganaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ you nailed it. Kamla Ji and Kangana Ji Salute, Love &amp; Reapect ❤️❤️❤️
Kamlaji just nailed it

bc he dislikes what he has done
People are only worshipping kangana. Are you guys capable of speaking about the people who lost their lives, their parents, activists.

honestly has anything changed. Literally nothing

Only for Deepika ❤

Thanku so much sir

These type of shows are must be repeat telecast on television through this critical time of Lockdown

Very stereotypical at the beginning of the show... Rest was informative and had a good outlook

Guru Gobind Singh Ji, Saints, warriors, protectors, those who stand up for the weak, and those who support their families in the fight against oppression.

Please make efforts for my acceptance sir.
If you want to do more then do it less... In these times no one will trust the film industries... I am the only one who makes MTLB films. What is happening is visible... There is nothing deeper in real life... No injustice is happening... Sir, this is what is happening.. Give your disgusting justice sir plss and my voice. That's why... Now I don't trust anyone. Nfrat honi h
Ameer sir   ap schai  ka sath dete hai naa  ... Toh ap sushant ko insaf dilaye....    Ap industries mai h...   Bollywood mai   bhi ye sb hota h  ... Ap us insan ko insaf dilaye ...  Plsss sirrr... 😭😭😭

Stupid amir khan flirting with Kanganaaaa ....

Kangana love youuuuu
I&#39;m watching this show only because of kangana Ranaut

Whoever said that men are not hard workers is completely wrong.
this show is not on hot star😠😠😠😠

I learnt alot from Satyamev jayte,,,, and I promise you amir khan sir that I will definitely be a good husband, a good father, a good son and also brother and friend,,,,,, I will definitely want to be something changes in myself and will be a good human being who loves people, and respect women and don&#39;t cheat anyone in the world,,,,,, I will definitely do this

Real man should be honest and respect women there won’t be any conflicts.

I am looking bad for 5 years.... Now only a few girls have become Bollywood main bastu hai mani jati hai... Ishka Matlab said no one had called on the toll free number.. 💔💔💔💔
Sir plz.vapas chalu kijiye these episodes
Kangana overshadowed other two. Sachi bharatiya nari sabpe bhari ❤️🙏

Movies hv a huge impact on the society... Songs all... Always tell ur kids it&#39;s all fake

This episode came 5 years ago and still movies like kabir singh are becoming blockbuster, thousands of people are defending this horrific movie! This saddens my heart!

Hi amir Sir plz restart your show
Ye show firse shru khro Bai... Aaj b Kai naye or old issues hn Jo isme show m nhi khate gye or wo bhot sensitive hn...
Hats off to the entire team of satyamev jayte. Not only the team but also the people who stood over there as an example to change the society. Their honesty and guts prove that they are real men. Inspired be a lot. Let everyone of us promote something that impact the society in positive ways. I support this show and also expect these type of shows in the present and near future that influence our future generations.

Irony is he had item number in his own films! Hypocrisy

Everyone commented on Kangana on all sides...No one commented on so called Patrichay and did not do anything...and today tomorrow young people are creating danger..and no one did anything on the Hindu Muslim community..and a party's special log abused the woman. They keep giving..and give threats of rape if you speak against their party.
Ye show firse na chahiye
Jo log y show Dekh rhe h I&#39;m sure vo  esa nhi krte h because itne thjib bhre sbd  insanity k liy vo to bikul nhi sun skte Jo society me violence felate h.

There is a lot of chaos in the world.
I feel sorry for those families.It&#39;s really shameful how men behaves with women in India. Big respect for the old lady Big respect for those men who respect thier wives and help them with thier career without any shameFor does Bollywood actresses you can see clearly from the way they talk that they are so fake and they will keep doing that shit but queen And you can see that on her new movie

Would someone talk about the problems of those families instead of just commenting about celebrities!

NIT has a bad reputation because of such raggings.

Why don't you want to make clouds in this film too?
Out of these, only kangana is real.. She doesn&#39;t say yes to item songs for money.. When she said she refused item songs, she earned respect.. While deepika and parineeti can speak whatever they want but they don&#39;t follow it actually. That&#39;s why people love kangana because she is real!

<a href="">1:05:54</a> most honest and true opinion given by her about our Bollywood

I m 25.. from a village area of my state. I grew up with lots of difficulties,but never touched alcohol..never did smoking..never teased any girl..never disrespected any woman. And Still virgin...Failed miserably in love..now I ve a govt job .I m happy with my family. I m very happy with my single life ..this way I can spend my whole life..I want my family&#39;s safety and happiness ..I don&#39;t care anyone . I don&#39;t bother anyone. I hope with these small expectations I can spend my whole life peacefully.

Bismillah. Modesty honest helpful truthful sensitive care &amp; compassion learn such qualities. Thanks

So much respect for you Aamir sir...

Aamir sir: the wrong use of rape and dowry acts, rapes of males by females,  what about toxic femininity?You&#39;ve shown toxic masculinity, appreciated but show the other side too.....

Hello namaskar Sar main JK Kashyap bol raha hun sar aapki movie bahut kafi movie dekh chuka hoon main aapki movie bahut movie hai aapki aisi koi si movie nahin aaegi jonsi main nahin dekhi ho sar mein bahut bada fan hua aapka
Who is watching this after &quot;Chappak&quot; and knew Laxmi Agrawal through her Ted video.

India has become very corrupt society, once India was really good, but not any more. The society has become so detached and self centred.

It&#39;s feel so bad for girls being tortured...I want amir sir to start this again... I 16 year old boy want to just become a good human being and make decisions the basis of humanity...not on the basis of gender...I call myself feminist✊

Such a rule does not happen in the northeast. Because my mother did this, we count on hearing such things.
The one who faces trouble is the real dead.
I think deepika,aamir and parineeti have some memory loss problem

Very good disco

Very very good Aamir Khan Shahab thank you sir

Thank you again. Aamir Khan Sir. This is a topic which most men are yearning for. Being a Male myself couldn&#39;t help resonating to what u said. In our society too such myths about &#39; masculinity&#39; exist and also highly portrayed and exaggerated in media. At the same time there hv been brave artists who hv addressed these issues but most of the time they are snubbed. It&#39;s unfortunate that there are even females who encourage these non productive behaviours of men. And the fact that alcoholism, drug abuse, rape, domestic violence,  vandalism, sexual verbal abuse, &#39;hitting on&#39; women , crime, and school fights is portrayed as &#39; masculinity&#39; by elders,teachers ( esp ones in Physical training, Discipline ) , University lecturers, Professors, Doctors, certain Sociologists, Politicians, The Forces, Religious leaders, Actors,  Authors and even some Psychiatrists and Psychologists is really pathetic. I myself had found myself getting frustrated about these myths and the indifference and apathy of people responsible regarding this. I hv been snubbed myself for genuinely expressing my opinions. And some stereotype that only men can do heavy manual work,  only men can fight, and when choosing specialties in higher studies,  Engineering, Maths, are  more masculine than Bio science or Arts. And if a guy expresses his emotions by crying or shows that he&#39;s scared what BOTH men and women would say , &quot; Oh come on... Don&#39;t be such a girl, Be a boy&quot; . So the men are denied of expressing emotions which I believe is what has increased Male suicide rates. And even in the medical field of specialties there are some , - only few thankfully - who believe that some specialties like Anaesthesia, Paediatrics, Dermatology, Haematology are &#39;women&#39;s &#39; specialties and Emergency Mx, Surgery, are  &#39;men&#39;s&#39; specialties... But I had the privilege of having a father who never raised his hand against my mother. A father who accompanied his kids without doing a job and having fun with them while the mother was at work. He showed to us that manhood was not being dominant. It was about working as a team. Standing up for each other. And Aamir Ji , as I should Address u in ur language , or in our language , Aamir Mahathmaya, ... I hv been inspired by several motivational films in ur industry portraying real manhood, Rancho in 3 idiots portrayed  its brains which is powerful than power. The brave and compassionate teacher in Taare Zameen  Par standing for Ishan a boy suffering from Dyslexia, The Sensitive yet courageous Cop in Thalaash, The gallant father Supporting his daughters in Dangal, &amp;  The role u played in Secret Superstar, are best of ur contributions in redefining manhood.  And of course Amitabh sir&#39;s role as the lawyer in Pink, is proof that a real Man respects women not harasses them. Rajkumar Rao&#39;s vulnerable role in Stree, Varun Dhawan&#39;s sensitive role in October, Arjun Kapoor&#39;s enduring role in Half girlfriend, Ranveer Singh&#39;s motivational role in Gully Boy and Vikrant Massey&#39;s supportive role in Chapaak, are some of the best performances in recent cinema by Actors of recent generation who are   definitely on the path of redifining masculinity as well. The fact that some of these movies  had ruled over certain cliched stereotypical &#39;commercial&#39;  films is a good notion for men need to properly portray themselves. And the concept of men Supporting women and breaking stereotypes is also seen in Saand Ki Aankh where a male doctor supports his two grannies to overthrow the Masculine domination in the family, by turning them into national archery champions, In   Chak De India where the  women hockey team bring international victory under the guidance of their determined Male coach,  and  In Mission Mangal where a Male  Scientist drives a team predominated by women utilizing their practical &#39; household&#39; ideas to conquer <a href="">Mars.So</a> Thank you  very much Aamir sir for ur wonderful contribution towards both  men and women.

Nice kangana you are true and loyal women ,

Nice Aamir ji, whatever work you have done always gives a huge message to the people, Respect for you <a href="">#Aamirkhan</a>
Who are those 1.8k idiots who dislike this episode😠😠😡

Bilkul band hona chaey

What do you think about Nora Fatehi?? (item songs)
Not all families are like the one you are showing. There is equality between boys and girls. And in many places girls also take advantage of atrocities against women. An accident happened in front of me a few years ago in which a family was going on a scooter with their newborn baby, and on the other side, a 23-24 year old girl was on a scooter from the wrong side of the intersection. The girl was driving very fast. As soon as the accident happened, the newborn baby fell on the road. The whole family was hurt. Seeing the child falling on the road, the man slapped the girl. As soon as the girl realized that she had made a mistake, she started crying because she too had a scratch but it was a small one and it was a mistake too. Was his. A crowd gathered and started beating the man, no one paid attention to the fact that his child had fallen on the road. In the name of taking care of the girl, people were touching her at different places. Beat the man and took him to the police station. When the whole story was known there, the poor guy was saved, luckily the child was also saved. Shri Aamir Khan ji, in many places girls also take advantage and do wrong in the name of gender equality, due to which some boys and men also have to suffer. Not all men are bad, in your show it seems as if if something happens, it must be the wrong man. There are good and bad men as well as women. You are requested to talk about this hidden aspect which no one talks about. You may not get much publicity but gender equality will definitely improve.
Brother boy, why are you making such a bad movie with me?
Budhi BC jasti bakwas kar rahi thi..

PLZ AAMIR KHAN SIR PLZ MAKE ANOTHER SEASON WITH SOME MORE SOCIAL ISSUES

Where Kangana is sitting, she cannot talk about anyone or anything in the comment section.
I love you Amir sir
That&#39;s why now Aamir make dangal type of movie ...

I would like to videos Amir Sir

Those who like Disk, think of the dirtiest abuse in your mind, ok, I have given it to you. May the blessings of dogs, pigs, your mother always be upon me.
So nice Satyamev Jayate Episode by Amir KhanSuper video 😍😍

<b>WE NEED SATYAMEV JAYATE AGAIN</b>This is my request to the creators .We cannot rely on media as they are busy playing antakshari. We cannot rely on social media as it is full of propaganda. We Trust you and i believe that most people here would agree with me, We need this show in 2020 . <b>WE NEED SATYAMEV JAYATE AGAIN</b>help my voice reach the creators. hit the like button.

We need more of this!!!

<a href="">59:23</a> the satyamev jayte team is throwing shade soooo bad here...(Edit) that was before I saw this <a href="">1:01:42</a>

I&#39;m 12 and was in a co ed boarding school in semi-rural maharashtra. Kids from grade 5 to 12 were in attendance. I was in the girls hostel, and all the girls in the 10th, 11th, 12th and 9th grades used to have all these stories when some guy in their class was being an egotistical dumbass who, in a bid to impress his friends would try to ask them out or something and whenever they said no the douche would get angry and start making empty threats. Nobody could physically harm them because it was a very strict environment, but it still was disgusting. Ragging was also common practice, and some of the teachers would even promote it!The movies they showed us on Sundays for &quot; fun &quot; were always dubbed south indian movies were things like violence, ragging and sexual harassment were glorifiedThe very first holiday when I returned home i informed my mother and she took me out of the school. Hope that platforms like this enable influencers to call out such things.

Also women are largely to be blamed for men turning out to be toxic. A guy is most attached to his mother. If she can&#39;t teach him better then don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone else to be blamed. Also most guys have sister/s. They can school him as well.

Aren&#39;t the actress who sign up for such movies and roles also to be held responsible?

Hats off u Deepika keep your dhyaan <a href="">#chhapak</a>
Kangana first said no means no...
I guess Deepika done her song lovely after this show!!

Why are you a woman? Why do you eat a man?
No

Media will not demand to start this type of show instead of demanding shit like big boss.

Instead of showing Kapil Sharma show and savdhan india on repeat mode all day; satyamev jayate should be shown. This is the least Indian channels can do for us!!

Aamir Khan hates living in India,,,,jay hind
Out of all three actresses kangna truly meant what she said because Deepika ended up doing item song in happy new year movie and parineeti in jaaneman as song

Good

Yeh kaun h, who disliked this video...😤😤

Haram khor amir, you people have destroyed the cinema, you are dogs, you have hurt Hindus with this film, chutiya
God bless you sir

We h

The real disease is that which does not cause pain 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Did you tell Aamir sir whether you will ever meet us or not?
Hit for deepika maam.......
Humanity is dead.... Shame on society

Mujhe dukh h aurto ne aadmi ko janam diya kash girls ko hi jnam deti, apni kokh p aurat haq jatati.

The condition of the one who would have died would have been the same sir, you are not sad.. this is the fate of my beloved, this is my destiny, you are not sad….. .
So start by looking at the situation of the day and find out what is true.
what is the meaning of satyamev jayate matlab kya hai iska

Please never throw water on acidic reaction. The reaction of Water  with strong Acid is exothermic, which generates lots of heat and may lead to boiling .Adding water to acid doubles its reaction.

You did not talk anything but Kamla did not tell the truth.
Kudos to deepika she is working as she said

Am i the only 1 who cried????

That's good, sir
A man is one who does not commit any crime.
at 9.15 focusing on wrong person the boy on right is late aman satya kachroo. he was a medical student in himachal a young bright life lost he was ragged to death

Quote: “Hum Chahe jitna bee apny dish ko ya Filmon ko defend karien, liken yeh sharmnak hai jo hum dekhathay hai apni aneywale peerion ko”.... The Only QUEEN of Bollywood.KANGNA mam in beg 2014. Love, respect &amp; Salute to your Iron Lady.

This is my truo hero

Aamir is my favorite hero

Paeineeti and deepika ka ko kch nhi ata

They are worried about RSS since long….but now to log in they must watch those movies in which girls are shown nude….society is always moving in this direction which is wrong…
speech of kangana mam very educational and acceptable. excellent behavior.

True respect for amir khan to muture actor in Bollywood

Kya baat boli hai kangana maam ne I am a big fan of fer really respect her🤗
Yes sir, absolutely right...i also think like you said

Watched this episode after watching Raging bull..

We really need this type of show

In this episode, he talks about beatings and says, he fucked our ass. This little girl with little lust is the real Madhar**d!
What nonsense is this? Is this episode made to bring out the real problems faced by MEN or to humiliate MEN? This show should have invited men&#39;s rights activists to discuss the problems faced by MEN like :1. False cases of molestation and rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment etc.2. Lack of laws to protect MEN from sexual abuse by women. 3. Women-centric marriage, divorce and alimony laws.4. Denial of child custody to MEN in most cases. 5. Reservations for women in legislatures, educational institutions and public transport systems. 6. Schemes which benefit only women. 7. General mentality of society which considers violence towards MEN as acceptable.

I think Kangna mam is so good she is strate forward

Problem of inequality for women most important problem of slow legal process for crime result

This episode was so good I think everybody should take learn from this episode this is so basic and very important problem of our country

Right sir the human being has fallen a lot
Deepika did item song after this ...so it&#39;s very clear ..paisa hi sab kuch hai inke liye

Such a meaningfull topic ...ppl only think of man in terms of men vs women ...there are other aspects as well .

One sided stroy h only ye

Somewhere in my life I am trying to prove my masculinity to them or they are trying to become a mother. When I am a mother to my son, I am a woman, teaching the girl to see masculinity in the future, which is the beginning of boys. I did not make any mistake, my mother and father made me feel guilty, so why should you tell me?
Awesome

thanku so muchh amir for this show, u r unparellal .

I only hit like button because of Kangana . She is the only SENSIBLE women in indian flim  industry . All other just care only about their career rather than audiences!

Thank you very much AmirjiA great show. Thank you very much.🙏👍

Shukar hai Aamir Khan ne apni films mein toh society ko acha message dena start kar diya hai is episode ke baad.

Hum log pehle din hostel gye aur ragging karne k liye ladke aaye.... Thank God usi time (Nabha ke rehne wale) boys aaye, and they said..... Agar kisi ne kisi bhi ladke ko preshan kiya toh saalo ko nanga kar ke hostel ke bahar kar denge, upar se mere group mein bhi sabhi ladke aise the jo kuch bhi galat hone pe chup nahi rehne wala the. Hum mein se jyada Sardar the, hum sab ne bhi virodh kiya. Fir dubara na hamare sath kabhi ragging huyi aur na hi jab tak hum hostel mein rahe, kisi se ragging hone bhi nahi di. Nabha ke un 3 Sardar boys ka main aaj bhi thankful hoon.

It's as if Triveni doesn't know how many mothers and fathers she has, who are not in the world because of the wrong face. If this is masculinity then you are on such masculinity.
I have seen no one beating my father's son, and no one saying anything to anyone.
Well made, very good episode. Focus on South India, it is much more worse. Even the educated &amp; metro city, NRIs are on same level of these North Indian villagers

If children watch movies like Harishchandra, Swami Vivekanand, then children will also become like Harishchandra and Swami Vivekanand.. They will plant the tree of Babul till the morning, where will they get food.. As the child watches, so will he become.. If that child grows up, he will become someone's. Rape has been committed.. I am more guilty of those evil faces coming on television than that child.. If the society has to be improved then Bollywood will have to be changed..
Arey bhai ek desh main rehe rahe ho Toh milke rahon insaniyat naam ki chiz v nhi hai us hawaon baap Or bete ko saja do... Ek baapko is tarah khone ka gaam us pita ko he pata hai...

I genuinely believe Parineeti would beat up a guy who even tries to eve tease, misbehave with her

Zra actor actress se hatkar tym mile toh yahan bhi dekhein <a href="">#wht</a> should we do these institutions#<a href="">21:46</a>

Girls always want to be with Humour and comic

Is man's masculinity only for his wives or for gf's, losers, criminals, liars, rapists, murderers, harassers, pedophiles
only kangna&#39;s compliments seem reasonable and helpful, like she was kind of speaking from her heart, other 2 girls were typical fake greedy for fame bollywood

Among three of them Kangana Ranaut is so intelligent.....Deepika remember ur lovely ho gyi song I hate ... Parineeti u r so hypocrite.....

SAME type of board written about women not there in programme................what a TRP

Seriously a bad side of india always seen....  Money money and always money is not everything im surprised that judge is asking for taking money and that father hes saying for taking revenge and that mother laughing out side the court seriously..... Really india have to be strict

Jhootha amitabh... watch the film, never be happy, never be happy.. never say anything.
Kyu nikal to ho fir movie

Ye jo dislike karne wale hai.... Gobar log hai gobar

Anyone noticed Lakshmi here after Chhapak trailer

Really enjoyed this episode. I think it is parents responsibility to treat their son and daughter the same way. Boys should be taught to respect their sisters and female cousins. Another thing is rewards and punishment should be the same.

Deepika evolved so much from then..., she is believing that films shows impact on people... <a href="">#chhapak</a>

Sir Aamir ji I like your show very much and have a lot to teach.
POWER and our mentality makes us BEASTS  whether it may be women or men. Women suffers as daughter, wife, and as long as she become Mother in law she enjoys the power and becomes beast .... 😳😳😳

Who introduce RAGGING in our educational institutions???

This father and sons photo should be circulated online... need to see those bloody human

MOB LYNCHING are done by MEN and they are 🦊 WOLF 🐺 who attack in GROUPS. Right!

INDIAN POLICE 👮 shame shame
Must watch episode of Satyamev Jayate every day...❤️
This is absolutely awesome show . Thank sir @amir Khan ji  for everything that thought us in your shows

Everybody is talking about Deepika&#39;s dance in Happy New Year.. The character demanded it moreover why isn&#39;t people focusing on the fact that Deepika&#39;s character was also inspiring apart from that item song

Everybody is appreciating kangana but can we just take a moment to appreciate that old lady ...

N even Aamir did that &quot;surraiya&quot; song with Katrina after such a long meaningful discussion..

Honestly speaking all three actresses were being real. Deepika expressed her lack of awareness about the impact of movies to real lives and that&#39;s big of her instead of pretending to be informed/aware. This rings true to me and I am sure to many people that through such shows and other content we become aware no matter how mature we are. Sadly I am seeing mostly negative comments saying how these actresses especially Deepika and Parineeti are being hypocrites but even Kangana said it herself that being against the movies that degrade women doesn&#39;t mean the realities and darkness of life shouldn&#39;t be showed. Not every item song is bad and of course a character who is a bar dancer will be showed to be dancing not doing algebra.

People be commenting on the celebs instead of the topics at hand.

One culture of India that I find most useless is that of those who say that men never feel pain, men should never cry and only girls cry and are weak, expressing one's feelings towards men in the face of this culture. What is the meaning of this?
This show should never stopped. Aamir Khan, you&#39;re amazing

One of the epic episode 🙏🙏🙏

Kangana always makes a point and stands out... Just love her to the core😍

Hatsoff amir sir...........I want this show back..... please comeback with new seasons.....

Instead of showing the slow movies of Bollywood, this show should be shown.
<a href="">01:08</a> parineeti and deepika did item songs after this interview. 😞

I want to meet kamla mam what she said was wonderful

Kangana is always underrated... She&#39;s the best among them all.

To learn what is Logical Fallacy,  I would recommend this! 😊

Who is watching this in 2019,like me

We want this Show Again

Plz bring this show once again in star plus.🙏This show is the need of the hour in this society now.The show at least can change the mind of the people which can&#39;t be changed by law.

My favorite bollywood actor who is always teach us something via his creativity.

a recent show named &quot;100 greatest performances of the decade&quot; filmstars like depika, raneer, alia ayushman etc talks about negative roles of filmstars which strongly influences the mass people. Most of them saying that they don&#39;t care about the negative effects towards the society instead they are greedy of doing different roles as an actor. Strange.... therefore the audiences, especially like me, are afraid of seeing a movie before knowing the mass reaction towards the movie.

Women are opportunistic and take every decision in their own selfish interest. A man has more morality than a woman. Just as every woman feels that her son or brother is innocent even if her husband is guilty, but in the eyes of a man, he is considered guilty. He is not partial… Gilligan (psychologist)
I hope all men are things that topic..,

Amir is the real hero and real men

This is one of my favorite show after ellen degeneres cos they all do it for people those who are really in need, I keep following all this pages I wish I could contribute and work for this agendas and bring some awareness to people. We are not realizing that we have brought hell in  this living world. Amir Khan he is my fav. mostly because of this show.

Abe sale aamir chutiye tere is show ke baad ke movies me ke item songsdekh pehle...surariya...Thus of hindustan..kamli ho gaye...dhoom3..chutiye paise leke public ko chutiya mat bana

Yaar ye sab hot hai..ye film industry walon ko mere paisa hiye…ye Aamir..amitabh…and ye teen randiyaan..Deepika kangana aur parineeti..sab naenge 🤣😜😜😜
Literally every Hindi movie I watched in 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s had these themes: gunde lardi ko cherte hain (sometimes rape karte hain),  hero khub  fight karta hai ..... being able to fight villains off physically was like a general motif in every movie. And there we wonder where people get these ideas from? We as society should stop appreciating this in our movies.

Kangna was best than others...... love you kangna...😍

No is talking about it, but that video about cinema has Amirs song too. I loved that the most how he didn&#39;t exclude himself. <b>I have done it so let it be in it.</b> 👏

Look at Deepika Padukone. &quot;I uSeD To HeAr tHaT mOvIeS HaS ImPaCT On SoCIeTy&quot; Dumbass..

So much anger that even she would sacrifice human life just for the sake of an iron tin...😡
Waiting for more season.

The most stupid response by Deepika... I never knew that filmo ka itna impact padta hai until now.... Like really Deepika. You were considered a dumb earlier but now you are a certified dumb and a bimbo....overhyped overrated....

Then I should say that the human being having penis is called as man

Ye Deepika ISS episode k baad v kitne Sare item songs ki hai... Like happy new year....

We want satyamev jayate season 4 On topics like:Lynching hate crimesEnvironmentAnd so on

I don't want to make this episode.
Very respect to kamla basin. Very intelligent and very well explained

Aamir Khan &quot; Mai bhi sensitive hu&quot;....A love jihad attempt for kangna......😂😂😂😂
Budhiya has learned a lot about styling...it seems like my youth has seen the effect of styling a lot.
great insights by kangana mam!!!c seems super observant!!

And now most of the guys want to be like Kabir Singh..we never learn..

Great programme with great personality

Action Speaks Louder than Words, Most of the People Respect and fear Bad people(Most are Men, I agree)

Someone said that what a samaj it will be if there is no emotion between two people my opinion is look at us look at this generation filled with so much emotion and it is ruining us

Deepika saying no<b>Proceeds to do happy new year</b>

What Aamir said he never realized, his film has also made a mistake...and after that Aamir has not done such films...great sir...👏 and Kangana is my favorite...😊 films maker in 2014 Didn't take even a few steps...still everything is bad...or even the worst Netflix shows are no less than zee 5 shows porn...never seen on the trailer, I am so dirty.. .akdm is bad...or people's comments are so bad for the actress...or even ghatiya...
<a href="">#KGF</a> scene added aah gaya Tooli mein nahi kela but ke aah
To parineeti 'janeman aah' what is the meaning of song?
I love Satyamev Jayate

I thing Aamir khan is man of honesty .  He is best.

Those who want to know how woman are safe in Islam..Plz read it once..<a href="">

Sir,i think flirting in these days is also a mirror of masculinity. Boys love one girl and he plays with the emotion of other girl and say its a way of happiness.i smile and fight for my self respect but now I give up, bcoz I did it for a girl status but everyone calls it bewakufi, I can&#39;t handle rejection, one sided love bla bla.somwtines I feel our society is like domuha snake 🐍

Who is powerful  suppressed weak its nothing  about male n female  its about powrr

This episode is not for men, make an episode about women!
Kamla ji is absolutely right. misogamy does not make a manner. thinking should be good

This show is full of prejudices against men.... Don&#39;t generalise men and women..... Women to have bad qualities... Sad that feminism destroyed West.... And now entered into Indian society

Don't know how much this will mean...How many people will live like our Akash bhai and Tabrez bhai😔😔😔😔🙁😟
The society which doesn&#39;t love women..Only has violence , control and ego...

Those 10 students must be happy and enjoying their life..

This show should come back.... And keep running

3rd class is low in India or this India can never improve from today till 2050
Deepika, Kangana, Parineeti --When dance number is given they compete for it. Now we are on the show🙏🙏🙏
Please bring back this show.It is eye opener and very educative for ignorant people like us who doesn&#39;t even know their society.🤧Thank you Amir sir.

Deepika Padukone is silent .......

Film life di tara banaya kro real life ta fuddu ni
Kanganna looks stunningg 😄
Alok Dixit sir... 👌🙏
There should be no strict law against ragging.
i think bringing amitabh is such a hypocrisy, dont they know about karan thapars experience with him and his affairs?

I need Aamir ji's number, can anyone please reply?
Madharchod aamir khan more bolda hei...fucking program
Kangna,Amir,Srk my fav bollywood actors coz those sens of humar always roks..Great work 👍Amir khanlove from Gujarat ♥️

When will Amir return.. Please start the episode soon 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I miss this show please can we get this show back

AHEM AHEM KABIR SINGH AHEM AHEM

So so so proud of your work Amir.. This is what India had been waiting for. It is the fault of upbringing and society that portraits the qualities of man to be &quot;LIKETHIS&quot;.. Which is totally false. Just give them a chance to think by themselves without the influence of society, films and upbringing. I am happy to see many men who were proudly regretting their mistakes and now are a cause of this change in mindset. So happy for this change and mainly that they started to think truly form heart.. Thank you for showing this Amir. Much needed education to society. I am so proud that our Indian, is the cause for change of upcoming India. Liked mainly the talk with 5 men and Film industry people to show how people are affected with their words and work

The irony, bollywood fucktards talking about women safety. Fuck u bitches....Amir fuck u. Making money on people&#39;s problems. Fuck u forever

Believe me these stars can do any thing for money misal ke taur pr parineeti , deepika aur kangana teeno hi item songs kr liye aur Amir khan me surraiya jaisi wahiyat gana kiya.

Deepika is totally absent

Talaq talaq pe kya hai apka Mr Amir khan
Everybody has commented on films and the actresses....They are not the real heroes....and this video is only a jist of the basic incidents that should be considered very seriously....The people should change and I would want all the men to watch the video

Dislikers are not real man... hahaha

In 2019 i feel only the Kangna ranot is followed what she said in 2014. we all respects you kangna you are the actress whom  should be followed by girls and respected by  men. ☺

amitab bachan in 1984 support violence say on national tv &quot;khoon ke badle khoon&quot; kill the sikhs for indra gandhi murder.So stay away from these fake talks amitab

Kangana this this insident also happenend with me

Ragging!! seriously!! guys get over it why do you have the need ! why can&#39;t you stop your friends! why can&#39;t syou speak up!!

sEE EVEN DOING SHOWS LIKE THESE PEOPLE TALKS ABOUT THE STARS AND THEIR STATEMENTS!! INSTEAD OF THE COMMON MAN SPEAK ABOUT CHANGING THEIR MINDS AND GET IN BETWEEN WHEN INCIDENTS LIKE THESE HAPPENS. PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE SELFFISH. THIS IS THE WORSE PART THAT IF IT WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS YOU WILL NOT SPEAK ABOUT. YOU SHOULD STILL SPEAK UP!!!IT IS A OLD SERIES BUT STILL THE SYSTEMS AS GONE WORSE.
M ek family ko janti hu unke ladle n ek ladki ko 9 saal tk  bevkuf bnaya shadi k name pr jb ladki n uske parents ko btaya unhone bola ki ladka h aise hi krega .....n father ek reputed bnk m manager h n sister scientist h n boy himself want to become a ias officer ......

Kangana ji salutes Amir ji you too
Deepika sali tune to is show k bad bhi nanga naach hai..
Deepika is fucked up

We all should refuse item songs

All feminists are sitting there
Parineeta...then made jaboriya shading...hmmmm
this show was sooooooo good,, why did it even stop.. anyone in 2019?

Everyone is talking about kangana deepika..thats all we do..instead of talking to us..instead of men seeing  how the def of masculinity harm them;as women nothing more then u then ur respect and  self dignity...when u will talk to yourself

Abh bolo Aamirji ne Kya galat kaha jabh unhone kaha we have become Intolerant Country!It&#39;s out of his and his teams research that he could conclude this.I am sure he might have come across more scenarios than we can think of and could barely manage to present in the show as it would be difficult to bring it on Television for all audience.

<b>But after seeing me</b>I swear, after hearing this, my blood has boiled, but I can't tell.
Very North Indian culture and behaviours.

I came for kangana ❤
Deepika wrote on her statement lol Vahi hain ye jo my choice jesw videos bnayeYaha to bus fake bol diya i didn't realize until now
I like very much this program. I think is not more in the air in India right? Sad. All my love from Barcelona, Spain.

I read many comments and 99% comments about film star. So sad. Every story is pathetic that who the stars come in the show and what said is insignificant.

Those who dislike the name are the ones.....
Yes.humanity has changed...
All comments about KANGANA😘😘😘😘😍 great job....qween

Who watch this interview for kangana in 2019......

Amitabh used to be a dishu....dishu....dishu Hero in movies, singing to heroines, etc in his young days.

Parinetee is talking like school girl and what is depika doing on this show is she a judge 😂

Kangana z d actresses who has sense in everything she does

You.chinlVeri.nic

So called item songs are influenced to men and young boys Bollywood and all other wood&#39;s as this is an international problem watched by all people.Men always make filthy comments and remark at women bcuz of this.

the ragging reminds of those times i wish india would draw from its rich ancient culture rather than copying people in the west

I can see the smiling faces,twinkling eyes and glowy face of these three men n there wives....happiness is radiating from inside of all...So conclusion is that,there is no loss of all the mens of this World in BREAKING STEREOTYPE.. TRADITIONAL IMAGE OF A MAN

Wow sir it&#39;s a very educative show.... I have learned a lot frm this amazing show..... N I want to mention with proud that.... In Leh Ladakh of J&amp;K.... Women are not supressed neither in history nor in present time... N I feel very fortunate to born here as a female.... Hats off  to team Satyamevjayate for wonderful episodes n  for the awareness they spread.... Love n gratitude frm Ladakh❤

The person who did that ragging I hope u r getting nightmares everyday n u r not happy in ur life....I hope when ur kids will be in the college when they get ragged u will realize what it feels like

who is here just for Kangna 👍👍

Only because me people earn millions government and private people .i am hard working

Deepika got d one ....😍

Kangana is the best,deepika you did rabta and many more...kha dhyaan diya🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are bc indian army mein sab mard hain jaake unse seekho mentally tough hona kise kehte hain

Deepika is really smart not saying a single word, aamir is forcing her but she is still quiet bc she wants movies and more fame in future. That’s what she got but no respect like kangana.

Yes sir even d devil rapist sohanlal who raped aruna after coming out of jail after 7 years got married n is having a family...how cud even any girl marry such a rapist

Buddiman hi ashili balwan
Ragging is an issue in most colleges...i dont understand the logic behind showing off your superiority this way though...

Actually real men r those who has all these qualities protector,good thinker,supportive,bla bla bla But the fact is such men don&#39;t exist at all....we get tensed bcoz of them the way they comments it&#39;s heart wrenching........................ nd sensitive by God,they just hurt girls

Kangana&#39;s rangoon.. What about this

Sir please make a video for an army...

Deepika be like , i have money and i do whatever i want, but she so intolerance 😒😒😒

we want satyamev jayate back..come sooon

Anyone who has such insightful opinions on such matters knows how the world works. She can never go wrong in her life. More power to you Kangana

Kangana k paas bas dimag hai ... Parineeti or Deepika no clue what&#39;s going on.... brainless women...

Deepika is dumb

We wnt satyamevjayate 🔙

Kamla ji said everything right but there is one thing... Kishan only commits suicide. Because we have already financed it
We should bring this show back....

Indeed No changes in indian movies

Yr deepu is too sweet
Deepika Ji is wrong in the sense that women only want love, women want everything, the concept of a &quot;trophy husband&quot; is very strong within the ego of a women

Good Amir God bless u

Fake kangana over atitude hy Blady stupid girl
Next day on 10th Nov, Deepika ka item song aa gyaGyaGyaGyaGozzzzzzzzzz<a href="">
Kangana is best
I was /am always a fan of Kangana,her thought and her intelligence.

Itni samaj seva Karni hai to free me Kar deta show

Hi, I looked for the book which kamla mam has written on masculanity. Unfortunately, i could not find it. Kindlz, sent me link if anybody knows. Thanks :)

Kangna mam is really good soul. Hats to miss kangna. She is honest, sincere and main point of kangna ji is woh  sahi ko sahi kehti hai.

No means no. So guys I humbled  request u plej give respect to girls.

I have no words for this episode....It&#39;s a wonderful

India need this show more now. Blind faith in government, fake nationalism, fight in name of religion, etc has taken over

What about their fathers and brothers don&#39;t they count as men😒recently ragging started in our country school too but thanks to the social media its being stopped😡

Are you dog parents? Show your children what you teach them to become a scientist or a good citizen.
Please start new season. It teaches us a lot and love the show

The worst thing is to log the law.
Aamir bhai aaj is episode ki link mujhe meri Life Partner  ne send ki or bola ki meri ek khwaish thi ki meri life main jo bhi hoga usse  main ek baar dekhne ke liye jrur bolungi nd usne aaj aisa hi kiya nd such main bhai is video ko dekh kr mujhe apne andr bhi vo hinsak mard dikha jo kisi jangli janvar se km nhi tha bhai is video ki vjh se main aaj apni life puri trh se change krne wala hu or ek promise krta hu ki main apne under ka vo jangli janvar ko puri trh se khtm kr dunga Thanks you So much aamir &amp; Thanks you so much My life Surbhi.....

Kamla jeet make Totally sense.  A true man is those who give love not fight.

Kangna is  best

Fir se shuru kijiye is show ko

Moral education should be imposed in todays school.. It is high Time that future kids learn about Kindness, Love and Compassion.

The men of India will be like this, these ladies are speaking but the women of the rest of the world are not hot like this… In my Pakistan, the men are brave, courageous, respectful of ladies or the most important Indian, is men. This is not rape. n last think Amir sir i respect you alot n love you so much... n agr aap k india ladies he is wrong because he doesn't wear or show himself or doesn't understand how much he respects the ladies. Power is the most important point of human being, no matter what everyone sees or understands, if ladies wear these clothes then ladies' privates are clearly exposed, those who do not want to be looked at, you are wrong ladies, Indians are
There was an episode of yours which was about Dowry. I would like to say that in our mind we need to understand our parents and boys.
Kangna is awesome

A woman or a mother can play a very big role at that time when a mother and father share or give birth to a child or raise him.............problem 🌲 What is the cure for that tree? We will have to live in the winter of society.
Filme samaj ka aaina hai aise chize dikhate kyu ho filmo me jisse logo par galat asar pade

Yrrr truly right now I got aware that kangna haven&#39;t  done any of the item number. ........such an honesty ......such a true to her words ......girl such a down toward earth person I have rarely seen in real as well as reel life.......many blessing to you girl😍😘😘😘😘

Good aamir khan good job.
Best episod.
Koi kabir singh ke FANS ko ye episode fek ke maro.EDIT : DEKHO FROM <a href="">58:16</a>

Is there any1 in 2k19

I have said that this society has not come to anyone who is unlike the 66th episode and has ruined it. Then only those who are unlike will pass by not accepting the truth.
Teeno my fav 😊😊
A man will feel pain when you touch him in between the two thighs.
We need again. 2019.. New season of &#39;Satyamev jayate&#39; Hitt like if you want

Deepika wants to be loved lekin paise se ghar nhi chalta

After watching this episode , i truly respect kangana she was hella fire 🔥,,,,

people have too much time for watching comedy video but not time for such video shame on you share this video with your family and friends <a href="">#make</a>_india_proud..

Kangana is looking so beautiful

I&#39;m agree with Kamla Bhasin

Amirji in your program Joni rotaho use panipilado use uska gmkmhoga
Very true men are week and emoshnailly disbalanced, and the most important thing needs to mention over here they are always searching someone whome they can put the blame.. All men are not same some of them has present very good example, count of those are very less.

Unfortunately these things are happening in many Asian countries such as Afghanistan :(

I don&#39;t understand why all the comments about actress&#39;s.their are plenty of other people who shares their life&#39;s experience then why their is no comment about them.this is high time we should stop bothering about this celebs .we have many more problems talk about them grow up.

Sorry, but I don&#39;t agree with the idea that because of masculinity, men becomes violent. Don&#39;t generalize one gender on the basis of their physiology. A man is defined by his masculinity. Without masculinity he is nothing. And don&#39;t relate masculinity with violence. It&#39;s true that men are built strong, but it doesn&#39;t mean that he always will oppress females. What defines a manly man?- Showing courage in difficult situations, having confidence in himself, uplift other people from their misery, having leadership quality, loving and caring for his family, standing up against the wrong, being too strong to be gentle etc. People often misunderstand masculinity with being oppressive and violent towards others. But, it depends upon their upbringing by the parents. Women can too be oppressive towards others mentally if not physically. There are plenty of examples for that. So, rather blaming men and trying to curb down their masculinity, proper direction should be given to it. Men like Gandhi, Vivekanand, Muhammad Ali, Theodore Roosevelt, Arnold, Gautam Buddha, they are all masculine men. Masculinity is defined by quality, not only just by strength.Also, when time comes violence can also be needed.&quot;IT&#39;S BETTER TO BE VIOLENT THAN TO BE COWARD&quot;

No matter how much we are fans of any actor, we have a different respect for Kangana.
Aamir said the right thing.
Dekhna hi bnd kr do esi filmein apne ap sochne par mzboor hoga bollywood nd filmmakers

Amir khan doing such great work by bringing real life stories hats off to him Excellent work done

I love listening to Kangana. One of the most sensible and realistic people of Bollywood industry. Also Enjoy listening to Vidya Balan, Rani, Sushmita Sen and Priyanka in public talks.

<a href="">51:25</a> she knows the future of aasifa..

Kangana u r the bst. No one can compare with you... Bss ma'am, this is how we live, our brother is not coming from you, please take care of him.. This is my request to you as a sister.
Solute to Amir👍
3rd class county’👇🏻
Only in India 🇮🇳  shame

Everyone is here talk about heroines....no body appreciate the acid survivor girl

Look at Kangana!! What brain and guts this lady possess!

Who dislike the video ..... 😠😠😠😠😠

4 years later Amir did a movie Thugs of hindostan having 2 item songs.Bloody Hypocrite

Emotionally, girls are much stronger than boys.
At the very beginning of the episode Amir asked men and women about their opinions on Men where after women denied to the adjectives given to men, Amir believed them. I wonder if the same would happen if we reverse the genders and if men would be taken this much seriously if they used such image destructing adjectives for women. Secondly, they showed only those scenes or song lyrics where women were objectified and I wonder if they have really not seen movies where women played negative roles and even misused their gender for some gains ( latest RX 100 is an example that I can think of at this moment but I believe there are many ). Third , those who blindly admire Kangna for being bold and intelligent ,which I don&#39;t doubt she is, and those who are saying she sticked to her words and did not do an item number afterwards, she has had many intimate scenes in her movies ( Shootout at Wadala to give an example )which also affects the audience and portray the image of the genders. So if movies are to be taken this much seriously then even Alok Nath dosent deserve to be spared.

Amir ji thank u

Indian police r the worst police in the world

In future, celebrities themselves have admitted that they like bad boys..see they show boys as boring..Emraan Hashmi has got heroine in every movie based on this style.
deepika is brain drained
This is such a LEFTIST propaganda. Fuck this.

Wow! Kangana was just 27 at that time but seems like she&#39;s wise beyond her years. She&#39;s the only actress among the three who made the most sense and seems like she has the most knowledge about the mentality of most men who harass women on the streets.

Sunny Leony is in the film industry now ... so what actually u want to teach people ??? 😑🤔

Kangana...honest reply ..
Bringing out these stories and also talking about the parents... so that people understand what they are doing...
Jnb apto khud itne charges leto ho ek show hosting ka

Ye Bollywood wale phir bhi nhi sudrenge

The best relatable title for this episode should be &quot;violence is harmful for everyone&quot;and &quot;consent is the most needy thing in our society &quot;

Grandmother has said amazing things.
Kangana is  such a nice person...wo apna strong opinions dia  iss topic par ....parinidi v thik thi..... Par deepika sirf apna sakal dikhane ae thi....

I am glad to see so many people appreciating Kangana. And for good reason. Deepika seems completely off during the whole interview and seems totally disconnected from the world she is being questioned about - the world that has helped her build her career, make her money and show off her wealth. It is quite disheartening to see people build these very public careers and only survive because of the public interest in them and act as though they have never met these very people who have followed them enough for them to have a career. Very unfortunate that celebrities still think they have landed from heaven and have nothing to do with real life challenges and reality itself.

Wow guud actor- personAAMIR KHAN,,,,,,,THANKS for gudd..gudd jobs,,,,,,,,

No one has commented about the father telling his sons story

It is such an honour to see such men who take care of their family and do not feel ashamed about what society will say.  In all woman&#39;s eyes they are still manly in fact they are true macho men.

In such a poor way, the thoughts have changed, the sisters or brothers are not visible.. In Sanskriti Sanskar, the first people, men or women, are the ancestors of each other. Anya kaisa kaisa v hoo, the effect of their education or society is there, so pls don& #39;t be insulted both man woman.Jai hind
Why you talk about hindu ...Not  about muslim..In any episode

today i realised why people say india is not safe

Great topic Amir sir.and the show is great too  &#39;Satyamev jayate&#39;

Yes

Kangana  is quite intelligent lady

Im big fan of you Amir khan ..💗 Im from Pakistan . I like your concept....

Yes plz stop showing female as an object n item. Amir loved this episode.  N sorry for those family who lost their son&#39;s.

Every here is for kangana Ranout not for chopra and padukone

when kangana deepika together, then deepika ignored infrontnof kanganaa, because she has point,  brain luks and personality.

Medically violence, aggressiveness and anger is in the genes of men....if an additional y chromosome is added to a male fetus there are many chances that he will be aggressive and criminal.....

The only quality that makes  man a man is to control his temper....

one sided and biased episode was this.somebody should call Jordan Peterson or ben shapiro.

Where did such a hot man come from? Here is the bench.. everyone's IQ is below 100.
When masculinity harms men? Such bullshit.

Can we have this programme again

Why did he even invite deepika on the show...she seems blankkkkk like every interview

mai samajh sakta hu................ what a fucking insensitive bitch

Wait <a href="">59:30</a> ...thats  aamir

BUDDHA TEACHING IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS

Today to get &quot;Insaaf&quot; , one must take laws into his hands, there is no other way, courts are useless and you are just wasting your time there, the time and money spent on the court, the same time and money you can spend on gangs and buy Katta (guns) and get insaaf yourself. Thats how it should be done. Police should be killed as well, they are cowards and cant do anything, they say they are bound by law, but the truth is they are bound by their FEAR and they are scared pussies. Don&#39;t expect anything from them, they can&#39;t even kill a mosquito. Also Satyamev Jayata is a bullshit show, not showing faces, addresses and place of work of those accused in the cases but showing the innocent victims and all information about them. Fucking scumbags. Amir Khan, fake tears.

Deepika is quite most of the time

How cheap is life in our country... Take it from anyone, even if you get bail..
What a wonderful law India has made, no system shows no value
Let me watch this just only for Kangana Ranaut. .  I love listening to her intelligent talks..  She always talks sense..  No bakwas!!!

So now in thugs of Hindustan. You&#39;re dancing on a item number and proving yourself wrong.

The bike owner who killed his animal must be 100% caste, Gujjar or Thakur…he is very proud of his money…I have a case in front of a bus driver who touched his car. When we use this car of any race, we mark it on the cylinder head.
I hope ranveer is right guy
One of my best show I have ever seen Today I have learned so much

Egoistic toh hote h

2k19❤
I miss this program satyamev jayate

If you like this bad show, then Kangana's mouth will start speaking 2 words, but someone else's child will die because of ragging, that second child will die when she wakes up, that mother will cry after beating the father. Killers who got fucked without sex, those lowly laws, no one is angry at Saab, but she likes to speak 2 words like Kangana Chutiya, but this is what we hope from girls, Kuch Bhi Dicko will see their feminism, Kyu repeats The show will be good, the shows should also be for the common people, what a band it is.
Parineeti is the biggest hypocrite ever. She is being like I hail from a small town and used to go to school riding on a bicycle. Her classmate slammed her for lying about being poor. 🤣🤣🤣 Deepika as always doesn&#39;t know how to and what to speak 😏😏😏. Way to go Kangana 😍😍😍

bullshit.

Love you granny...... Great thoughts

Kangna maim y r verry  sensitive ..and thaink you very much aamir sir 🙏🙏

Greatest episode ever
I&#39;m from pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰 Al Khamdulilah hmare idr collges universities ma aisa kuch b n hota har koi apne marzi se study karta hai ..aisa kyu hai Idr aisa kyu ni hota ? Islaam is the sloution of all humanity 😊

&quot;Whoever has unliked is actually against the humanity!!&quot;

Deepika she is the one of the dumbest actor I have ever seen in my life.

deepika is all about &quot;you know&quot; and &quot;like&quot;😂

Where are the rest of the episodes of this season?

Made me cry sir ji
Deepika is so dumb.. Kangana is best

2019 anyone??

Fasi par latka do
Hi

Kangana is very brave in real life if anyone doesn't believe it then please watch her entry in Aap Ki Adalat, I can say 110% that you will be her fan.
India listen here, it’s not a “punishment” if you can bail out with in two hours of the judge sentencing!

I absolutely loved the author lady...she was so smart and explained it so well.

We need more shows talking about toxic masculinity

Ohh God 😭😭😭😭😭
When someone harres girl or tease girl or touches girl on private part .. jabardasti .... without her permission... She feels very bad...she Cruses her from her heart.... Very bad feeling. .. feeling like being raped ...it&#39;s a harresment wost feeling like someone is beating us

So true I love watching satyamev jayte it&#39;s so true thank u for this episode So trueMy brother is a na mard and my husband is a real man ...real mard helps me honest

Sir phir se start kijiye kisi issues par sir please

Someone&#39;s gender doesn&#39;t portray their personalities

Kangana too good 😚
not a single comment about family members that has suffered...but all the comments about filmstars. .. really ???

More relevant now than ever before. Who would&#39;ve thought... 2019

I hated that guys started hooting for actresses comments and they want to change lol chutiye.

WOW bollywood change a little bit.

Why the idiot people are comparing over here  ! 90% of the people I&#39;m seeing have seen this episode to compare not to listen to their points! You should not watch this type of shows if you end up comparing

World Best Show

This couple is completely fake...it's just falsehood.
Long live Kangna...
Mai bahot parisan rahta hu please help me agar app log help karna chate ho to please coll kijiye my contact no 6205578260

I have tried many things but no one is listening please help me
Deepika did kamli in happy new year...so she is a complete Hypocrite

Deepika ne film bohot karliya ..Lekin today I realised she is so dumb

Only kangana 😘

Kangana!! Proud of you!!

Just we have to do one thing &#39;Nationwide ban on ALCOHOL&#39;  this will bring down 90% crime rate.

It would be more 'Sane' to buy a boxing heavy bag, bring us to the house and eat us and throw insults on us, make someone 'friend' him. out on
kitnee aurtay apna life insurance apni family kay liye kerwatee hai ki uski mritu honey per uska insurance ka paisa uskay patee ko milega

Kangana is honest and a true actress and Parineeti also but Deepika has not said much about this topic so i think she is not satisfied with it

Deepika is totally  bimbo.

I always feel that this Bollywood is spoiling our society. It is the basic factor. Now they are doing drama here. I hate these people. For them money is everything nothing else. KASAM SE

One of my relative burnt his wife...now he is on bell...nd guess what...in my family except me nd my mom feels he is inocent...

Kangna is brilliant... Just loved her

<a href="">1:22:54</a> BIG B !!!!

There are too many dirty rules in Haryana, there are too many people who have the temerity to say that, there are people who have too few passes. People in the vehicle spend a lot of money and I am not shocked. If controlling a woman is masculinity, then I laugh at such men who attack women just to keep them under control.
People don't even feel guilty for doing a mistake to someone. I am shocked that it feels so bad if a dog gets hurt even a little because of a mistake. All these things are still happening with humans...
I can&#39;t believe this for some students ragging is fun but in reality it is torture.... gvmnt should need to take some strict action nd need to stop this kind of stupid rules nd things😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Kangna ko cyco pagl confuse bolne wale khan gye ab...?? She is beauty with Brain

Wonderful  show,  i appreciate the subtitles

Deepika really did a good job. Polite, well mannered, makes her points clear, doesn&#39;t insult anyone for publicity. Class woman good job lady

These women have no father
Kangana is honest and real personStrong enough😎😎

Parineeti did an item song with varun even after thisAtleast stick to your words Totally fake

It&#39;s unbelievable that people live and treat each other like animals. Insaniyat hi nahi hai humhare samaj mein...jaise janwar bhi aise logon see achhe hote hai.Rapists get married...people who throw acid gets married...who burn women get married...it&#39;s true what kind of a society or even women would allow for that to happen.Justice is hugely missing and that&#39;s why crimes happen. If the legal system, our societies we&#39;re fair then there wouldn&#39;t be any suffering. Humanity as a whole is very cruel. It&#39;s very sad.

The best part of the video is from <a href="">47:05</a> to <a href="">56:05</a>

As soon as I wake up, I don't know how long this sky has been covered with clouds....
Indian culture is very weight that is must and possibility how can I go to up like people work somebody 24 hour work 8 years work don&#39;t come for family don&#39;t see you will buy something for baby how sorry my friend Indian culture is very wet

Dipika useless talking always senseless .

Deepika is so dumb 🤦‍♀
Ab time aagaya h. Girls'
Why was deepika even called on the show, with intelligent women like Kangana and Parineethi ??

and there is one thing i dont understand: in this Show They are talking about serious topics and inspirational Persons like the woman, who survived the acid attack are introduced .but instead of commenting about this  , everyone is praising kangana ? Why are so many obsessed with actors??

thats the reason my Father Never let me or my siblings Watch tamil movies, because this movies conveys absolutely wrong messages about  relationship between men and women, plays down stalking and violence against women etc

One of the best episodes 👍👍👍👍
You expressions are always real.

You are very sensitive and very trueI respect you !

Really good and one of the best actor as well as person I saw

You are the best!

Amir sir, you have done a lot less because you have not faced the wrong things or let people know what wrongs are happening in our country, people need to understand these things or people need to reform only then the country is safe.
This wrong tradition should be followed by GVT and a similar rule should be made or people should also stop the crime where crime is happening, or poolik should be called, now everyone should join in saying the right thing, mainly women or girls.
Etna acha show q bnd kiye plz start karo.fir se

What&#39;s wrong with Human race ? I hope these things have changed.

Amir sir, you are very good, you see us as the real face of the society.
It is said about such people that we are human beings.
Aamir is biggest fraud .in the industry....he cheated his wife ...hv a child in abroad ...and married twice....kutta

After this Amir made Suraiya

Akash Parents lament was heartbreaking

Oye Aunty Testosterone has come from the vehicle of aggression.

Sir, according to you, 95 percent of crimes are deaths, but I would like to add to this that 85 percent of crimes are deaths in North India.
And Guess what in those clips akshay was present everywhere and now he is doing movies on social issues.😂😂😂

Till then there will be cinema in India...
Delhi people is worst in the world... M Living in delhi nd i know tht

Ye family kha rhti h please btao

Satyamev Jayate - Season 3 - Episode 6 - When Masculinity Harms Men | Rajesh was an auto-rickshaw driver in Delhi. His family was preparing for Navratri celebrations in Karnal and he had promised to join them. But that day never came. He was brutally killed by a group of men.“He was beaten up mercilessly by a group of men just because the rear of their car was nudged by his rickshaw,” says his mother, Sashi Bala. He begged those men to spare him because he had small children, but they beat him up with bricks. The men, who were drunk, also shoved his face into an overflowing drain and left him to die. In one fell swoop, the children lost their father, a wife her husband and the mother, her son. “Because of a moment of rage, our family has been destroyed,” says Sashi Bala.Today Rajesh&#39;s wife Sageeta makes ends meet by running a stall on the street. “Those men never even gave a thought that this man might have a family—what did they lose? We lost everything,” she says. Sashi Bala wishes they would have controlled their anger, “You can pay for the damage to a car, but how do you bring a human being back to life?”

Bhot afsos hota hai ke aj bhe kanon Amero ke sath hai Or Garebo ka koe sunne wala nhe

We actually need to show these things in every schools ♥️

heart touching video sir

Chutiya is turning both the parties into a bunch of chickens.
im baaawling my eyes out, the fathers talk brought me to tears

Very nice Amir sir

Me being a girl I feel that girls think  wrong  about  men

That ku6 did not happen in our Gujarat.
You great for me Aamir Khan

I love you very much Aamir Khan

It’s such a superb serial forever plzz come back

i think every single woman deserves respect more than love. because every girl is beautiful and they can be attracted or they can can be loved by any man. but i think love is something that comes through that respect. if a wife cant&#39;t cook, her husband should take it as her decision not as her weakness. i think it&#39;s a misconception that women just wants to be loved , not at all. women wants to be respected as well as loved. and the whole thing i said earlier also goes for men also. because every thing should be done from both of the sides, not from only one side whether it&#39;s man or woman. thank you.

Kangana is same then and now also... Very good... Don&#39;t change Kangana... She said &quot; no means no &quot; 2014 itself... Wow... And people say she is fake.. these people are crazy

Thank God Pakistan ka censor board bht strict h..
Not one man has died in Matlab India. Who has married?🤔🤔🤔
Solute to Laxmi......

Deepika: &quot;we just want love.&quot;Am also adding a new word. i.e. &quot;we jst want love nd RESPECT.&quot;💕

I only want to ask Amir sir about the item song of Katrina Kaif in the movie thugs of hindustan.

I am not surprised to see these 1.5k unlikes...but still want to say that we need to improve.
If a man is not brave and strong then who is protecting his country today? If a man is emotionally weak then why do he care so much about girls? If a man is not a hard worker then who is running all the houses and families of the country today? ?? Just Aurate?? Some men do not give respect. Meaning, all men do not give respect?? LOL Mard never beats women?? Where did you get this logic from?? LOLOLTHIS SHOW IS TOTAL MISANDRY AND A STUPID FEMINIST PROPAGANDA This is how it is if any show is made on the weaknesses of women.. All FEMINAZIs will come to attack..
Kangna really uttered truth......... a real lady. Aamir! 90% of the things shown in film is  not only nonsense and meaningless it has been deshaping  the brains and minds of Youths and Children. I feel sorry for the scenes shown there by those actresses and actors.

I want to meet you personally The Amir Khan Sir.Please call me at this 8806752560 number.

I had faced bad comment yesterday by my student

Thugs of Hindustan - how many item songs did the movie have?

North east india one of safe place both male nd female compare to other part. Bc of tribal society. More high caste more discrimination.

pseudo feminism 53% rape cases are false...

good job sir

I am feeling proud after seeing Deepika...
Only kangana and amir is real celebratiy

This is what you people share and this is what is happening in the world
I wish someone knew the true nature of women, he would never marry.
Please on air this show again please please

Why didn't Aamir Khan say anything to Salman Khan?
Lovely Aamir --- Tooooooooo Good to be True ---- Salute Aamir

I&#39;m from Pakistan Asad Mardan

MASH ALLAH Very good MAN SO NICE V good  Mr  Amir Khan

The penis of the deceased is visible sir............and also.....
While show was excellent specially Bhasin mam but what Deepika said about love was totally wrong . Girls like only successful handsome and rich guys .

Deepika is Do Dumb.. Kangana Ranaut got brain. like always. to point 👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍
Sir mard bole tho sri ram hai sri krishnan mhaveer swami vivekananda hai swami dayanand baghat singh mangal panday cand shekhar azad
Sir please have a comeback with a new hope for humanity in the world.

Mard bahadur nahi hotemay be true in case of civilians what about our soldier brothers and our shaheed heroes?other points its okay if ruled out..but sisters.. u can&#39;t say men are not bahadur .

Ragging is such a big problem in India. Men should and can be protector&#39;s. I remember when I went to college. My friends and I were so scared to be ragged by our seniors. We were going to our classroom and we saw bunch of seniors looking at us. They looked at us and then one of the guy said &quot;Leave these girls alone&quot;. They didn&#39;t bother and went somewhere else. So, there are good guys too. So Guys, you can be a role model just like the guy who protected us.

I love it

Someone who is telling the every story seems Karan Johar

Aamir Khan, your shows are very educational.  Love it.  Keep up the good work..  Also, waiting for upcoming shows.

Kamala ji, you are fucking DOPE.

How dumb deepika looks :/

&quot;Men are protectors and maintainer of women.&quot; Al Quran

Depeka saying wrong she can talk like this because she have a lots off money each richest woman want this but not odnery woman&#39;s without money love never ever servive

It program shooted in 2014. And deepika still doing worst bakwass movies .. speaking like an intelligent lady.

All these dislikers are assholes...

9800850708  9933633558

Deepika sirf sunney k liye aai thi

No means no
My real hero Aamir Khan
Aamir sir u t great
I'm big fan this show. I also want to be like Aamir sir and try my best to become a good man.
Who is that gorgeous?? @ 31.47 &lt;3 &lt;3&lt;3......

There are only two men on earth, Sir and horse. Man is and should be only a man of youth.
Stronger will Dominate

May be that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like watching movies or songs. Also bcoz when I see them not as a piece of entertainment but what&#39;s actually being shown, it disturbs me. But many people around say sometimes it&#39;s alright, you should also watch. But yes I do watch Aamir sir&#39;s movies which have new perspectives of Life.

No one is saying all men are bad.. its about power.. when women get power they also behave bad... but since long bad history of world we cant deny patriarchy power.. look at the numbers.... woman have always suffered...  i know few men who are very sensitive not only towards their own family but to others as well... but those who are not need to learn...

Islam is religion closer to nature... so it introduces some rules and regulations for men women bcoz of these social issues..our prophet pbuh also make rotti with her wife hazrat ayesha....

Thats why people said negative things about islam and hijab for women and ghas e basar for men...means look below don&#39;t stair women....

It&#39;s time to start satyamev jayate again

This is one of the most sensitive and emotional episode i have seen of satyamev jayate. Seeing men and fathers cry for their son, is heart breaking. I just hate these words, &quot;men don&#39;t cry.&quot; Why do people say that! Hyper masculinity harms men and women so much! Please society try to understand, men and women and all other people who identify themselves as non-binary or trans, are part of our beautiful nature. Do not harm it by forcing hyper masculinity or hyper femininity on our future kids. Make a better world.

All are not equal

@35.50 Aamir&#39;s telling how nice he is while others are pouring their hearts out... Come on man

Who is watching now at present

There is a suggestion that the movie should be improved, which we have read.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, Aamir Khan, you are the most noble, good person and you are God to me. You are doing and I am also running a campaign to completely protect the girls, under which I give full 5 hours to this campaign every day and I write 2 messages on Facebook and WhatsApp every day, which take 3 full hours to write. It takes hours and every third day I post a video so that people can be made aware of the girl child and incidents like rape and incidents like acid attacks can be completely eradicated and eradicated. All the girl children can be completely protected because all the girl children are my sisters and daughters, so I want to take this campaign to a bigger level, but there are some constraints which are becoming obstacles in my campaign. I am not afraid of them, I will definitely take this campaign to a much bigger level and protect the girls because the girl is the second form of God very very thanks amir sir ji and I love you sir + karamjit sohavi mob .8968351625
Love dis show

Please start again

LolCan you also make an episode on fake dowry cases? Fake rape case ? How men are abused everyday? Pls..This is so damn one sided ..seriously.

This episode felt soo good when it was airing but now it is just cringe compilation.

i wish I was there to answer....I just watched for 7 minutes then stopped seeing a stupid discussion going on.ALl these ladies should been asked whether everyone of them feels the same for their own father (who is a &#39;mard&#39;).Moreorver, how many times these ladies have let their own &#39;mard&#39; to help others, whenever there is a crisis. &#39;Generally&#39;, in any crisis situation, it is the aurat (mother, wife, sister, girl friend ....) who stops the mard at the first place to avoid any conflicts. Irrespective of good or bad, this is the fact.In any train accidents, flood, or in case of any types of accidents, how many aurat we have seen on the spot for rescue? They are using some exceptions as examples... They are trying to show as if every mard is bad and the world is really full such evil mards. Such a stupid philosophy. They should think of their own fathers, brothers, teacher and each and every mard who they have come accross throughout their life. Honestly speaking, I believe women create more problems for the women than men in our day to day life. God bless those thinkers....

Kangana love you 😍
Real men protect women...From what? Other men. 😑Maybe men should stop being the danger women need to be protected from instead

Kangana is so right about shakespeare&#39;s stories...His stories always show consequences of bad  acts

Kangana said No to item songs &amp; also to fairness cream ads...Love her

Deepika has done 2 item numbers...Kareena Priyanka...all top actresses have done it...Shame on these women!

grt show

Best show in the world

First tell karan johar to stop making films. Always show love triangle, cheating on partner as emotional feelings, affair after marriage.

Plz bring this show backAmir bhai I learned a lot from ur this show

I just love kamla ji
Nd den go n watch  suraiya song...

How can these women say men are weak like srsly i agree with issue they are discussing in general But wtf our army consists of men who give up their lives so they can live happily and make such bs comments

Love this show 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

PLEASE START THIS SHOW AGAIN... WANT SEASON 4

For the society, for our country, how much responsibility we have as a human being, we felt heartily today.. Thanks Satyamev Jayate
what i feel is, &quot;being is macho&quot; feeling is there in the mind of boys, we cant deny with the facts but girls are also deeply involved in ragging, and believe me its not on small scale, its on huge scale just to show that they are brave( by ragging boys and girls both).

Pls make an episode on bullying

season 4 should also start 🙏🙏
Everyone who wrote wrong about deepika and parineeti for them i want to add that the main discussion in this interview is how masculinity has affected our society and how a mens behavior has contributed so much crime in our country which has nothing to do with the songs deepika did, that’s her profession and she has right to choose what she wants to do. We are only picking her in this whole interview and ignoring the main point of how we are supposed to raise or sons and guide them right and how our doubble standard society needs to boycott rapists, acid attacker’s, dowry seekers and should not at least marry them.

Kamala ji you are great
Haryana ke man maderchood hai Hit like if you agree
This episode was aired in 2014. Thugs of Hindustan released in 2018 which has Amir Khan in it too, has 2 item songs in it. <a href="">#fakecelibrities</a>

<a href="">35:33</a>  💐 <a href="">1:17:27</a>
Kangana ranaut is an inspiration for many girls she says what she do shes very genuine and frank no actor /actresses can talk like her boldly

There was an uproar in our country because of Aamir's intolerance. Who did not understand about Aamir?
Delhi only bhsdk.. there is no pride so much that even the PM can be called.. let's see.
i love Aamir Khan&#39;s thinking and so &quot;satyamev jayate&quot;

Amir khan is against the making of item songs. Now in nov 2018 he doing surraiya in Thugs of Hindustan.

Ms Kamala was my favorite, we need more people like her

Deepika exactly got wht she wanted in form of ranveer😜😍

Well done Amir 👍🏼

Kangana speaks perfect hindi and english at the same time. Beautifully articulated woman.

producers should bring this show again

I like satemyae jayte
If Song&#39;s Does  not have Correct word s SOoooo why these heroine&#39;s say noooo  to these Songs.... Because these heroine&#39;s want Moneyyy

I wish there will be effect of your great conversation in  People mind

Anyone in 2018? I love Kangana group discussion etiquette, she has very strong opinions to share but does not interrupt nor screams/desperate to get her points across.. excellent quality, thumbs up Kangana.. the rest were good as well..
