MISS SIGNED 28/05/2023.

I had no interest watching this or any other rom-com movie and the first half of trailer was making it seem an out an out silly comedy but it was on tv so i thought how bad is going to be and how are they going to wrap her story and then the Ending happen 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Hatsoff to Anushka Sharma for taking this role

from srk vlog😂❤️
Because of shahrukh khan vlog i visited here

Who has watched SRK vlog?
How many of u r here after watching srk mini vlog 😂

Diljit Dosanjh ♥️
Really nice movie

He played in life of pi

Love you Anushka Sharma ❤️
Watch in 2022😂

I only download this movie beacause of diljit dosanjh but this movie does not give best result, may be awarded as most silent and boring movie

That time was beautiful when this movies was released.. ❤ 2016-2017❤

hello...✋✋✋ m from phillaur.....🤘🤘🤘
Where would i get this movie

<a href="">1:34</a> soul stirring

Now audience prefer new talent like phillaure movie actors, even anushka Sharma is an outsider.

Very nice movie

What a beautiful ghost she is, Anushka Sharma, what is the matter with her?
<a href="">1:34</a> Goosebumps

Very Funny

Why did they give Suraj Sharma such a fucking terrible role. I mean, the guy was Fucking Piscine in Life of Pi. He has STANDARDS. HE IS A PHENOMENONThe movie was good but his role sucked

If anyone has seen this movie, a small song is played at 13 minutes, who knows, this is not the song of this movie.
A beautiful movie ❤️
Jk

Iss movie ka hero shayed life of pi,, ka hero tha

Amazing!! Unique Concept😍🤗.. But underrated 😨
Movie to nai dekhi bt love the songs .. 😘

Is that the boy of life of pi . Wow l am amazed

Plz watch the complete movie at <a href="">youtu.be</a>
Diljit Great

I just love Diljit so much,❤️😊
beautifully cut trailer.. one of very few movie trailers i watch again and again.. Thanks Anushkaji and Fox Star for such a lovely and beautiful film...

This is a very nice movie, all the actors have left hope. But I don't know whose Diljeet Paji emerges naturally in every scene and every character, it seems that this is the real band that has made the film :)
anushka looks stunning.
Had Ang Lee not selected Suraj Sharma for Life Of Pi we would have never realised how much talented he is.

Mehreen 💝💝
Nicemovi

No one become kangana 😂

Who else watched this movie and fell in love with it! Especially the ending!!!!!!

interesting  trailer...

Everybody Knows That, The Movie is Earning It&#39;s Profits Because Of Diljit Dosanjh, The Story is Crap, We All Went To Watch The Film Just For Diljit and Anushka&#39;s Namesake :v

sooraj sharma... hez fun to watch... anoushka... beautiful as ever...
awesome movie fhilory

lol ped kyun kaat diya, atleast could&#39;ve got her back home or tree whatever.

I have opened the story of the trailer and the movie.
I didnt know he was Suraj Sharma From life Of Pi He look so different .Wow.!

Very nice

it&#39;s boring movie ... don&#39;t waste your time....

supereb mind blowing cried cried cried at end ... masterpiece

Does anyone know the name of the actor who was Shashi&#39;s brother in the movie?

Nice Movie....love it..

filop movie
I saw this movie it&#39;s nice

so nice movie I like this is the best movie comparing to badrinath ki dulania

kmaal act by diljit so nice movie <b>***</b>
Hahaha... very funny movie...

nice movie

siirrrraaaaa movie
Amazingly emotional and a class apart movie which keeps the audience completely engaged and guessing as to what is coming next until the end. It is not run of the mill masala movie. Travel into flash back becomes more and more gripping as the movie progresses. Anushka&#39;s performance is great. Diljeet looks completely natural and  delivers a powerful performance. All characters deserve great appreciation as every character has a significant relevance and have done full justice to the character. Will definitely watch again and have already advised all my relatives and friends to not to miss this great movie.

<a href="">

I cant believe that he is the Life Of Pi actor!

It was a very good movie.. complete pack of entertainment..

One of the mosr beautiful movie of 2017

not the funny or entertainment movie so boring no story only bored

Poor Suraj Sharma... Sometimes a ghost, sometimes a Tiger.
Watched the movie. It is awesome. Must watch movie of the year. Simple and sweet movie. Daljeet was good and just right. But I felt if Ranbir Kapoor had been in the role of Daljeet. He would have added more value to the movie and would have raised acting level much higher than what it is . And movie could have earn more monies. Anushka why didn&#39;t you ask Ranbir for a guest role. If he sees this movie I am sure he himself will ask you for sure. kyon nahin liya Ranbir ko????

check my review here <a href="">

at <a href="">2:30</a> what an acting.  hilarious and adorable.

nice

who else noticed nidhi bisht from tvf??

,trailer loooking like <b>paheli</b> of srk &amp; <b>ek paheeli leela ki</b> of sunny leone mixed on <b>PHILLAURI</b>  I think movie will flop but anushka sharma will good work in movie!

madam anuskha ( bhootni )aap ne bhoot ki acting karke sayaad aapki acting abhi outri nahi aur aaj aapne bhootni wali baat kar di aaj maine cnbc awaaz par aapka interview dekha jisme aapne kaha aapki team ne 1st diljit ko reject kar diya tha agar filim main diljit nahi hota to pure movies haal main sirif bhoot hi picture dekhta &amp; pic super duper flop hoti aaj jo bhi picture ki wahi wahi ho rahi hain ouske 4 majboot pahelu hain 1) diljits dosanjh + suraj   ( 2) romy songs (3) anshai lal direction ( 4) punjabi story  ANUSKHA BHOOTNI  aagey se interview deo to insaan ban kar deo plzzzzzz &amp; dont undestimates diljit dosanjh powers every interviews you only bla bla bla bla &amp; you locked diljit mouths movies is super duper hits bcuz of 4 factors wich i mention above so dont fly muchs or if you wana check urself then dares to make another movies without diljit &amp; without punjbai tadka

Diljit is the best

scrap
nice,.!!!!!

nice,.!!!!!

FUNNY ...ACTUALLY ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY.... how this movie stole the concept of movie &quot;PAHELI&quot;  and garnished it with todays required tadka !! I was watching abbas mustans Machine movie trailer ..and comments are full with negative vibes due to his son looking ugly blah blah blah !! sad that people judge people with looks and everybody is running a &quot;BHED CHAAL&quot; ......i will rather watch &quot;Machine&quot; than seeing this &quot;COCK SUCKED OVER BLOWN LIPS FROM VIRAT KHOLI&quot;.......chutiyon ki kami nahin hain duniya mein !! saaley sab thoos thoss ke bharey huyen hain !!!

she is a pretty  good actress but she has ruined her face by injecting her lips

Sahiba should&#39;ve been sung by Diljit !!!!!

Sahiba should   have   been sung Diljit!!!

nice ... trailer,,

Eagerly waiting for you Diljith...😘😍😘💝

I love this trailer

It is so nice , I am gonna watch this movie

Yarrrr yeh movie when tak ayegiiiiiiiiii..... mjhyyyyyy Wait nh horaHaaaaaaa..... Supeeerrrrbbbb.....
It seems as per the trailer Anushka Sharma is excited for her marriage looking at her mehandi in her hands as if she was supposedly told to get married by Diljit ,but then se is betrayed and Diljit is killed and she did suicide and her spirit gets inside the tree where both of them used to tie the threads for wishes.

awesome friend...
who else thinks this is Corpse Bride?

trailer showed whole story...😊😂

Diljit is the  hottest thing to come from India (after curry). :D

diljit  wowe

This reminds me of Tim Burton&#39;s ghost comedy The Corpse Bride.

Add subtitle pls
I love anushka looks in the movie simple cute love u anushka

Better than remake song movie coming these days.It also has touch of old rural India which reminds of simple class of living. Not like befkiree i had 20 gf she has 21 Bfs full load of shit

amazing-_-
I think this film will be super dupper

Trailer looks so promising 💯😍
supar

Anushka always rock she&#39;s the best

The more you watch this trailer,the more you get excited about this movie...the trailer is just amazing.....

I think she is Nidhi Bisht(from TVF) at <a href="">1:43</a> with Anushka ....

the trailer reminds me of Corpse Bride hollywood movie.....Copied

awesome.. hahaha life of pi actor Suraj well done..

This is a fabulous trailer

best movie to be discovered........ really excited  ...👌

excellent
ahh love to the half
Fudu

i like diljit&#39;s roal
interesting movie i want to see but its releasing on my bord exam 😢😢😢

woooww i will be surely watching

this would definitely be the best movie of the year.

love you diljit

I think it not bad

Anushka has invested Virat&#39;s hard earned money by playing for India on this so stupid movie... ... I liked watching her in Rab ne and band baja baraat, but since then she her performance have failed.. Now she&#39;s with Virat only for his money.. Since she&#39;s not had much luck with acting she&#39;s turning to produce films as she knows her acting career is nt going to last long..but it&#39;s sad to see she&#39;s making a scapegoat of Virat just for his money...Besides on such foolish movie with some D grade actors, pity Virat&#39;s money is going down the drain and thanks to Anushka... I hope he realises her intentions to date him..Pls anushka get out of his life and let him play for india

finally a movie with a unique story.

watching it again n again for the song sahiba from <a href="">1:34</a>....wow it sounds really amazing...loved it..&lt;3

wow anushka tu ne toh ksmsl kiya re...

6k dislikes ? that&#39;s too much of hatred man 😏

awesome trailer...gonna watch this 😍

I think it&#39;s the first time that an actor who has played the lead role in a world famous Oscar winning classic movie is coming to act in a mainstream Bollywood film. High hopes from Suraj Sharma. Immense talent.

k..k...kahan....love the way he says pedh to kaat diya....

sahiba song got my heart.. And Daljit is.. been his fan since udta Punjab.. :)

how can someone  dislike this trailer ? it&#39;s freaking awesome!

Loved this trailer! Finally this is something new and different from the Indian Cinema. Phillauri looks promising as typical rom com movie! <a href="">#Anushka</a> and <a href="">#Diljit</a> looks damn cute. 😉😊 Looking forward to see this one!👍

😍 honestly no words !! Fab just fab !

eagerly waiting for it&#39;s release.

Anuska in law uh
Suraj Sharma has already acted in major roles in Life of Pi and Tv series Homeland. Extremely seasoned actor. Way ahead of most Bollywood actors of his generation in terms of talent. Hope he does well.

sahebaa
Hats off to Suraj Sharma, what an actor, what expressions! Stealing the limelight from Anushka Sharma!

bhoot

are this is good trailer bas real movie should be as nice as the trailer lol

nice

Another boring hideout film for couples brewing with libido who will go on to share their stories of how they had sex in a hall later on. Stupid romantic story being served as a masterpiece just because a phoren desi actor is acting in it - and dumbshots here are already stickying their pants up.

nidhi bisht at <a href="">1:43</a> ??
Waiting for the song Diljit rocks 🤘🏻🤘🏻

ANUSKA SHARMA REAL LIFE GHOST

reminds   me of  paheli

Are they Indian  or Pakistan??

They revealed the entire story in the trailer....

Who is here for Diljit dOsanjh Cha Gaya vEere

anushka sharma is d greatest actor in bollywood greater than d 3 khans d difference is only dat in this male dominated world only male actors r considered superstars.love her talent,temperament,attitude,public relations,beauty nd d types of movies she is producing.for now all d best for phillauri to anushka sharma nd d whole team.

Diljit will be a super star in Hindi Cinema too

sorry what??

Virat kohli fucked bitch
its the only talent of bollywood movies to show u the whole movie n just the trailer

<a href="">0:31</a> He&#39;s already well experienced in getting scared and fainting off.. lol
