If we take out all the dramatic part here and just focus on the situation they represent and the conversation they had.......these things happen in a relationship...and most couples in long term relationship/ newly engaged couple  go through it . The only solution is address these issues with your partner and if both partner is willing to make it work....it will work out eventually in the end

Come on SRK ❤️
After watching all these , I&#39;ll be scared to fall in love

Yeh jawaani hai deewani❤️🔥

I wish they make more original series

Amazon has got some good marketing managers who are very good at targeting and displaying their content  , that is why Amazon prime still leads in INDIAN OTT SPACE.

Best video on internet today

And legend singles won&#39;t have to go through anything..

A guy asked a girl in a university library: &quot;Do you mind if I sit beside you?”

The girl replied with a loud voice: &quot;NO! I DON&#39;T WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH YOU!&quot; All the students in the library started looking at the guy; he was pretty embarrassed. After a while the girl walked quietly over to the guy&#39;s table and said: &quot;I study psychology, I know what a man is thinking. I guess you felt embarrassed, right?” The guy then responded with a loud voice: “$1000 FOR ONE NIGHT? THAT&#39;S TOO MUCH!” All the people in the library looked at the girl in shock. The guy whispered &quot;I guess you felt bad for what you did earlier, right? I study law; I know how to make someone feel guilty.”😂😂😌
