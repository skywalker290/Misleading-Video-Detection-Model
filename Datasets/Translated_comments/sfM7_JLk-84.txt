Worst trailer I&#39;ve seen in last years.I&#39;m still gonna watch it for my fav SNL cast.

Such an amazing trailer for such a garbage movie

I had goosebumps all the time, music is insane.

Interesting (about Aquaman and Wonder Woman movies in DCU)First movie amazing maybe not perfect but amazingSequel supposedly the same team is responsible for its predecessor, but in the end it turned out badly

<a href="">0:55</a>

This is one of the best trailers in recent years and it had to have 80&#39;s music in it.

The Israeli actress is so bad, couldn&#39;t they find a bad actress in the US? They had to import her?

Best movie ever
Hi barbie
This movie was like eating a delicious-looking, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie that the baker forgot to add flavor

Why oh whyyyy... why couldn&#39;t the movie live up to  the hype of this amazing trailer???? Whyyyyy?  Jeezus, this trailer is a fckng  masterpiece!

Gal &amp; Chris did the best they could with a tic tok input script like THAT!She has to ignore obvious questions about how Steve just shows up from the dead Then as her powers are failing she walks away from a whole suit of wonder armor and then had to go back for it Then miss blonde thing changes into a super creature with way more wishes than the only one she was supposed to haveWellllll you just have to ignore the script &amp; feast on Gal wonder &amp; Chris pine candy 

nice stuff
Omg this movie was SO good One of my favorites movies definitely recomend

I call these Snyder movies bs if I had really like Batman V superman Moviethis Movie and rest of Zack&#39;s DCEU should leave other multiverse companiesMerchandise alone these Company like mickey should not own these Zack Snyder New 52 Creditsay it by Zack Snyder bot BVS should a been Amazing Comparison toTDKT Man of Steel if the Movie was not really so cheap never go a path next God awful Batman and Robin was a set Up Zack Snyder himself wanted drove another wave to That Movie

I still haven&#39;t seen the film but I come back to watch the trailer at least once a year. So dang GOOD!!! 

Best way to experience this trailer is to have AirPods in

This trailer and music deserved better.

I wish the movie was as good as the trailer. The storyline on how Steve comes to 1984‚Ä¶. Really? and couldn‚Äôt take the bad guy serious‚Ä¶.and his story line stunk. But the trailer is great!

Her Israeli accent is so perfect for Wonder Woman as an Amazon from Themyscira.

NEW NORMAL

Wonder woman part 3 set in 2000
If only the movie had been as dynamic and engaging and fantastic as the trailer.

The irony of having a Zionist play ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù as part of the ‚Äújustice league‚Äù while a genocide is taking place in front of our eyes

Trailer is 10x better than the movie

At the <a href="">1:40</a> mark this trailer in epic. That beat drop is top tier, just a shame how the film turned out...

its versus xiii all over again

Scenes of finery must be deleted because shame is spread and is forbidden
The music here goes so hard tbh

The same music should have been used for GTA 6. For an example; go and check my channel video for Gta6 version.

She&#39;s superman, batman, aquaman, spiderman, captain america, and neo rolled into one, except she can also do it in high heels.

<a href="">0:39</a>I like the design of these boots. I think the look was ridiculously amazing.
Liked the movie so much... 

My fav movie 
Best DC movie

I revisit this at least once every 3 months

I used to admire Gal Gadot, but my respect has diminished after her support for actions resulting in the loss of over 4,000 Palestinian children&#39;s lives in Gaza. This has influenced my perception of her and impacted my appreciation for her movies.

Dceu trailers - pure masterpiece, i mean remeber the first trailer of flash, Batman v Superman, man of Steel, Sucide squad 2016, black adamMovies - .........

Fun fact: the music in this trailer is the only good thing about this movie

This trailer had me so hyped to only be such a mediocre movie. Wtf happened.

Blue Monday was best insteof ww1984

For pedro pascal   
Imagine if the trailer is in the style of 1975 Wonder Woman, I would Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman fighting against Cathy Lee Crosby as Cheetah (Cathy Lee Crosby portrayed Wonder Woman in the 1974 TV movie.)

3 years later and this trailer and the music are still amazing.

The trailer itself is better than the movie. It didn&#39;t even had &quot;Blue Monday&quot;...

The Remix of Blue Monday is an amazing touch to the trailer.

<a href="">1:36</a>

Coming back to this masterpiece after 3 years. It&#39;s just epic

The trailer is a masterpiece, sadly the movie is what you can find in a trashcan.

Lionheart here Gail Gadot could have been the real wonder woman, saved her country with me at her side unfortunately she denied my wedding proposal to her face to face mono E mono you win some you loose a lot good going gal

one of the best trailers ever, why did the movie have to be bad

Am I the only one who loved the movie?

cool

<a href="">1:36</a>

This trailer is a lot better than the actual movie.

The only good thing to happen in 2020.

I never understood purpose of these movies

Whoever made the trailer should&#39;ve just made the friggin&#39; movie

The green screen is obviously reflecting through the glasses <a href="">0:51</a>

Am I crazy or is WW inspired by Saint Seiya? In the first (2017) Ares's armor is identical to that of Capricorn Shura, and in the second (2020) Diana's armor is the same as that of Golden Pegasus.
I enjoyed this. Good sequel.

For those of you who haven&#39;t seen Wonder Woman 1984 and are thinking about watching it after seeing this trailer, I&#39;m just going to say that the movie is NOTHING like the trailer... it&#39;s much worse.. I mean, all the scenes from the trailer are indeed in the movie, but the movie has far much less violence and more inappropriate moments than the 2017 Wonder Woman movie. I&#39;ll explain why (read below) (SPOILER ALERT FOR BOTH THIS MOVIE AND THE 2017 WONDER WOMAN MOVIE!)This movie, Wonder Woman 1984, also has a horrible-extremely inappropriate way of the main character learning her lesson throughout the film. The reason for this is because the main character, Wonder Woman (also known as Diana Prince) commits raping in the film, she does NOT do it in a violent way like how rapists just burst into their victims&#39; houses and grab their victims in a forceful way, but Wonder Woman still does it in a way that is intentional and unnecessary... Ok, I&#39;ll be more specific, as everyone who watched Wonder Woman 2017 knows, Wonder Woman&#39;s boyfriend, Steve dies in a plane explosion to sacrifice for Wonder Woman and the world... So basically, in Wonder Woman 1984, Wonder Woman makes a wish for him to resurrect. And although Steve does come back, he comes back by getting his soul possessed in a random man&#39;s body, which means the man does not have control over his body anymore since Steve is possessed in it, and after that, Wonder Woman starts to have some inappropriate romantic moments with him in many ways including kissing him and sleeping with him. Long story short, she rapes the man that Steve&#39;s soul got into in a romantic and sexual way, but not in a violent way. So, if you are the person who is not comfortable with movies or tv shows that contain sexual interactions, then I won&#39;t recommend you to watch Wonder Woman 1984 unless you want to see it.

If only the movie were half as good as the trailer.

Wow this movie could have been so good if it was anything like this trailer

iim indonesia

Compared to other movies from the 80‚Äôs this one has good CGI  

I liked this movie. I don‚Äôt know why it got so much flack.

I absolutely loved Wonder Woman 1984, but the only thing that I didn‚Äôt like it is that Wonder Woman commits raping in this movie and also that this movie has less violence than the 2017 film‚Ä¶ but everything else except those were good 

I found it  top casted.I was very impressed of the character of Max Lord. Well done Pedro Pascal.

Why didnt people like this movie i thought it was a good film

I was beginning to think if it was weird that i kept coming back for the trailer despite of not having liked the movie all that much, but after reading the comments, I feel so, so much better.

The movie was good and it&#39;s on the way definitely very far from the first one I&#39;m pretty sure if Zack Snyder was in charge of making this movie it would have been different

Melba as mabelle

This is like some sort of reverse trap the first moviehear me out&quot;only in this movie she knows more about his own world than him and it&#39;s fun to watch 

Such a shame this turned out to be a stinker. Even the beautiful, charming, and talented Gal Gadot could not save this film. The trailer was 10x better than the movie.

Just Finally rewatched Again.  Ughh.  Definitely fits with ghostbusters 2016. Trailer looks great, potential, excited.. But then o m g how awful in so many ways.  And the first one was excellent.  And gal was part of this one behind the scenes...curious.

We like Diana,because she is one of the best DC characters.

The Trailer is art the movie is a trash can

Reminds me of a time I got excited for DC-movies. After MOS, BVS, Wonder Woman (and maybe Aquaman) it all went south. Now I cringe whenever I hear of a new DC-project. I hate WB for ruining the DCEU. They had gold in their hands but decided to make expensive trash with it. To be more accurate, they had beautiful expensive treasures made by skilled people but decided to melt it and mold it into trash.

Funny how an okay movie like Barbie was pro-woman and slaughtered anti-feminist egos, whereas Wonder Woman ala 1984 crappy movie was an oddity which sponsored female jealousy, pathetic lovesickness, a preoccupation with fashion, and bedding a stranger who embodied a figment of one&#39;s imagination. Gross. The ending everyone hated was actually good, where she didn&#39;t need the stranger to keep her company and embraced her own path.

<a href="">1:50</a> she gives a low kick and is a truck what falls 

2023 and still revisiting this trailer (i have not seen the actual movie)

Great trailer for an absolute dumpster fire of a movie.

Who is still watching this trailer in 2023? Me...

The sound track is fire!

Who else is here 3+ years after this came out coming back just to watch the trailer?

They mad a loss? Damn. I blame PR.

Still waiting for the movie in this trailer to be made.

Trailer is 10x better than the movie.

This trailer  &gt;  The entire movie

I&#39;m glad that Gal Gadot isn&#39;t being replaced for James Gunn&#39;s DCU reboot. Gal is just perfect for the role. And now that it&#39;s been revealed a third film is being made, I hope it&#39;ll be great.

Worst movie in history
Warner Bros and DC are the only ones with Gal Gadot and Pedro Pascal in a movie and make a bad movie out of it.

Gal Gadot is wonderful

better than movie

May be this movie is not perfect but the trailer with that theme song os perfect

Such a good trailer for such a bad film.

Can&#39;t wait for the remake Wonder M&#39;mam!

My heart will never recover from this betrayal

Blue Monday  love this song 

Loved when Diana used her tiara in battle!

What a nice trailer

Still amazes me how good this trailer is and how the movie was equally as bad.

What...wtf was this movie? I missed out on all the promotion, hype and discourse surrounding it when it was released  but it seems that a lot of people in the comments are in agreement that it was horrible.

never watched the movie never watching it this trailer is enough

Good trailer, garbage movie

I didn&#39;t even know this movie existed till today.

This movie is an embarrassment to both Wonder Woman and the entire DC Universe  I&#39;m literally so pissed off for the fans that I will just have to find a way to completely take over the DC Universe and remake it in my own vision Ô∏è

Yes, me too, I came back because this trailer was beautiful

I commend you Lucy. In the face of fierce opposition and adversity you have done well to not only surive but thrive. No death hex was going to take you you. With God before you who dare be against you!

My favorite part of this movie is when Diana said &quot;It&#39;s Wonderin&#39; time!&quot; before inevitably killing her enemies with snu snu

Yes

donlom

Everyone will see how bad the writing and directing were....

One of the BEST movie trailer, and one of the WORST movie ever made.

Damn after all this time i come here again to watch this piece of art again and again. BTW i rewatched a movie again a few days ago and i take my words back. The movie is with a pretty deep sense (at least for me)I felt so bad for her (WW) you could clearly see that she loved him so much and Gal Gadot is perfect as WW. Pity we didnt appreciate it earlier

3 years later and I still come back and watch this because of its EPICNESS!!

In the 1950s it was wonder woman in 2023 it&#39;s wondering if that is a woman 

flash here u come

<a href="">0:43</a><a href="">1:42</a>-<a href="">1:43</a> &amp; <a href="">1:50</a>-<a href="">1:51</a>
The reason why the trailer is so good is because there were a lot of moments in the movie that were filmed for the trailer and had no bearing on the plot in any sense of the word.

The first two trailers for both wonder woman movies were PERFECT! Hard to imagine better trailers than these.  Next time..  place the person who made these trailers to direct the movies instead.

I can adamantly say that this person made tha Flash&#39;s trailer too .

This movie was a huge letdown. After Justice League this movie shouldn&#39;t have been made.

I hear people complaining about how bad was the movie. I think they just made the trailer way too good. I saw the movie after some reviews, so I went with low expectations and I kind of liked the movie.

The musical arrangement and transition starting at <a href="">1:25</a>  best part

MISS SIGNED 28/05/2023.

trailer was 10000% better than the actual film

Movie wasn&#39;t much, but this is an S-Tier trailer

This trailer tricks me into watching the movie. Fk! Im skipping all trailers from now on

A really amazing movie 

the trailer : It&#39;s all art!the movie : Uh, that&#39;s just a trash can.

I was sold on the &quot;1984&quot; direction because there was so much happening in that year! But nope! All they took from the year was the wardrobe (and even that was lacking) 

Cigano Devils Chaser Brought me here.

<a href="">1:40</a>

i like

Movie is good but it can be better. Maybe if there will be WW3, then they should redeem themselves production wise. But I&#39;m still a fan of Gal Gadot as WW. Hopefully theyre not going to replace her.

ww1984 didn&#39;t match up the first movie (which was a massive hit!) maybe it was done under limited locations during the latter part of covid pandemic..movements were heavily restricted, so making an hero-inspired movie needed a huge staffing.. but inspite of it, they tried their best to pull it off just to deliver a decent wonder woman sequel..the story wasn&#39;t too appealing, but seeing something new at that mid-covid era would be forgivable..

I still haven&#39;t seen the film, but I was listening to Blue Monday today and remembered how much I love this trailer, so here I am! Blue Monday sounds so epic here!

most deceptive trailer ever.
You are an amazing woman, dear, you are sweet, delicious, tonic, let's eat it, give me meat, let's play 
This is the best part of this movie.

Hard to believe that mall is long gone now

WW84    Suicide Squad (2016)               <b>both having better trailers than movies</b>

Happy birthday gal gadot
No matter how many times I watch this trailer <a href="">1:40</a> gives me chills every time 

this movie was good but it can be Better.

Editor: &quot;So how hard do you want this trailer to go?&quot;Dc: &quot;Yes:

alexa play Would&#39;ve, Could&#39;ve, Should&#39;ve by taylor swift

Everybody here is commenting on how good the trailer is x how bad the actual movie is... Well, I don¬¥t agree - both are bad... The movie is an example of how movie studios go bankrupt. The opening scenes, for example, cost them a fortune - dozens of stunts and special effects for absolutely no reason - nothing to do with the plot at all. And the movie is all like that - disjointed, trying to convey politically correct messages all over, showing the 80s -something that by now we¬¥re sick and tired of seeing in movies and tv shows, the whole movie was a mix of different ideas that made it a train wreck.

touch and suck this girl!.
What&#39;s your i we by your watch in she!

She is more beautiful than black widow and captain marvel, Way to Go DC

2023!!! 
I thought the Terminator will have a cameo, since that is the year he was sent to kill Sarah Connor. 

Such an inexcusably bad sequel.

It&#39;s literally mind-blowing how good this trailer is - versus, just how badly-written and corny this truly terrible movie really was.... UNBELIEVABLE.

Best DC movie

OH MY GOD. TODAY I JUST WATCH THIS APRIL 8 2023. I WISH I HAVE WATCH THIS ALREADY. I HATED IVE LISTEN TO OTHER VIEWERS THAT THIS MOVIE SUCKS. IT DOESNT. I CRIED WHEN SHE GAL GADOT SAID ILL NEVER LOVE AGAIN AND STEVE FINALLY SAYS I LOVE YOU DIANA NO MATTER WHERE I AM.

How did it not pass lazarbeam&#39;s google search

is anyone back in 2023 to say this is the greatest trailer and sound track ever?

1984
The film is  but the trailer is 

This trailer was the best thing about the movie

Amazing trailer bad movie disease

SIGNED.

Did not care for the movie, but this trailer was amazing

This is Formula one 2023 Ô∏è

Very great Super herroin the OG 

I remember when this trailer came out I can&#39;t stop watching it everyday until I forgotted it when pandemic strikes

I‚Äôd rewatch this movie mainly for the Han zimmer score 

This trailer is a legendary masterpiece

I&#39;m wondering how I didn&#39;t realise this movie didn&#39;t have a plot by watching this trailer

I am here for the bgm...

I‚Äôve never loved a trailer so much for a movie I did not find entertaining or enjoyable.

Dam this movie badass itself,,

<a href="">1:34</a>

such a good trailer, not so much the movie

Very cool
to the american amazon

united nations police for international responcibilities

Best part of this trailer is the Blue Monday song....

I hope trailer editing would be an Oscar category so we could the editor of this trailer one, he/she truly deserved one.

got to say, as far as trailers go, this is outstanding. film was average, but love this trailer. the soundtrack is banging

dc will always fool their audience with these trailers

Remember the rape scene? Lol

I don&#39;t understand the comments, this movie is powerful with a simple yet powerful message. The things we wish for the things we want can in return destroy us. We may think it&#39;s best for us but some of the things we want are for selfish gains and when you look in reflection even the words we speak are powerful. The movie spills into reality that we live in nuclear bombs, power etc I feel alot of you have missed the real message and meaning of the movie and too much of a &#39;purist&#39; to enjoy a movie with real meaning

Joel

this might be an unpopular opinion, but i think this movie actually had great ideas.the execution is lack luster, but its nowhere as bad as people make it seem.i wouldnt say its worse than smth like an average marvel movie (ex. thor 4)

There is no point
who ever did the remix of blue Monday shouldn&#39;t just get a raise but a promotion

Who‚Äôs here to try and see Pedro Pascal?

Pedro!!!!

<a href="">0:59</a> casio A168 watch

2023 still watching this masterpiece 80 s

This movie is good, but it can be better

How could such a bad movie have such a good trailer?

Sad to see they cancel Wonder Woman 3

THE ESSENES AGAIN

next the flash

THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED
Still one of the best trailers for a film.

Anyone in 2023?

1984 really

wish the movie was as epic as this trailer

This trailer was 100x better than the film.

With a better final act this could have a been a good movie

Milner Benedict III: &quot;My only wish is for The Goddess to win everything for Enternity.&quot;
1984: &quot;Star Trek III: The Search For Spock&quot;; &quot;2010: Odyssey Two / The Year We Make Contact&quot;.

It&#39;s the music that made this trailer

The <a href="">2:24</a> trailer was better than the entire movie. We got Cat fished.  

The movie which started the end of DCEU.

Best trailer ever. Too bad there will not be a WW 3.

Do you remember when we waited for this fim and the Black Widow at the same time, because of the covid?

The Trailer: &quot;It&#39;s all art&quot;

The Movie: &quot;Uh, that&#39;s just a trash can&quot;

Is the movie worth watching?

Awesome but off

Maybe it&#39;s a coincidence but I find it interesting that everyone is having an 80s craze: movies, tv shows, songs, etc.

I keep coming back to this trailer because of Blue Monday, I think it&#39;s one of the best Electronic songs from the 80&#39;s.

Sopotamadre what a good trailer
The concept of swinging from lightning bolts has sadly, as of 2020, been used in what everybody says is a bad movie.

I like the movie the wishing well ,I wish had part 3 

This trailer fooled us all. And I still come here occasionally to watch it and pretend the one that was released was just a prank

This movie had so much potential

Barrie, Georgian college , Ross street, JAN 2020

this trailer was much much better than the actual movie, what a shame....

Great trailer (especially the Blue Monday cover)...movie sucked though

The movie might be bad but this trailer is a masterpiece

All you need is just to want it. I want them to make a WW3 just to redeem themselves for WW2

The movie couldn&#39;t match how awesome this trailer was (is)

This trailer makes me want to watch the movie.The movie makes me want to watch the trailer (it‚Äôs so bad)

Trailer 100 times better than movie

Good trailer, almost every idea this movie had was executed terribly. Like the script didn‚Äôt even get past the first draft terrible.

Loved this movie. I don&#39;t understand why it has measly 5.4 points on imdb, this film touches one&#39;s heart on so many levels. Unfortunately with Affleck and Cavill departing this page of awesome heroes been turned over. Enjoyed while it lasted.

Part 3 asks for a fierce fight.
This was somehow recommended to me after Wonder Woman 3 was cancelled.

<b>Gal Gadot out of wonder woman films. DC films Warner brothers Discovery</b>

<b>In my personal opinion, Wonder woman 2 is a disappointing movie. The trailer was great with blue Monday song. I don&#39;t understand, but the villain is a stone. Sorry, in my humble opinion, it&#39;s right it deserves the cancellation of all saga</b>

SO BAD. the little girl the first 15 minutes saved the moving. the bad guy had terrible acting.

One of the dumbest movies I&#39;ve ever wasted my time watching. Gal Gadot is gorgeous and it looks good but the plot is worse than a 60&#39;s television rerun. Goofy dialogue and frankly unheroic behavior that makes Wonder Woman look like a bad person.

don¬¥t get me wrong... this trailer was so awesome, that i didn¬¥t, want to watch the movie anyway, this could never hould up to this expetations.

When Blue Monday is better than the actual movie. 

The movie was excellent, y&#39;all are just a bunch of idiots.



Funny how this movie takes place in 1984....

Dude, honestly this trailer is better than movie, blue monday - new order never lose in time

DC movies always have the best trailers with the most underwhelming delivery. Man of Steel and Dark Knight Rises are other clear examples.

Blue Monday is a banger

I finally got to see this movie on TV.
This trailer goes so hard 

I love this film and prefer it to the first. The first one has a good message though.Fight me!!!

Qhy was the trailer better than the movie?

awesome

And Gal Gadot's nude?
Allegedly it is not possible for you to Divorce him.

Dudet I&#39;AM not Dracula. That man Dracula is your Husband. Comprehend that Fact.

Suicide Squad Music video. They don&#39;t own you. We my family not from here. Terrible Attitude.

Problems about men, and the Exchange again.

NOT LINDA CARTER ISN&#39;T THAT ANGOLINE BILLY BOB THORTON IMPERSONATIN     COOK <a href="">#MONALISA</a> I MEAN BEN FRANKLIN THE MORMON ASTRONAUT. <a href="">#CREDITCAREGLOBALANALYSES</a>

if only the movie was as good as this trailer

cool

I don&#39;t even remember this movie

<a href="">1:40</a>

This movie disappointed me but something brings me back to it. Some things are not very good but others... Oh my God... It's so pretty... 
When trailer is better than movie

Disappointed in this movie. Thought it would be at least as good as the first one

Watched the movie tonight, all I can say is it was disappointing. It is like someone was full of themselves when they wrote it. When I saw the trailer I thought the movie would be right there with the first movie. It was not. This was cheesy dramatic.

Y did the made this movie this bad...

wb might be given us the best trailer

My fav part <a href="">1:40</a> to <a href="">1:48</a>

This is the most stupid movie ever made... Sharknado is masterpiece for this

Worst DC Movie after Shazam , BoP and Green Lantren

Over animation
This looked quite good on the trailer? But the movie turned out to be a huge Lemon, poor Chris Pine his hair seemed to get more grey the longer the movie went on, he looked very confused....

Am i the only one who likes this movie

The trailer is much batter than the movie itself

The only thing in this movie that annoyed me is wonder women can fly by using her hands like a plane propeller

Really outstanding trailer...nailed with music...

if only the movie had been a fraction as good as the trailer

well this looks a lot more action [packed and worth sitting threw than the first one that&#39;s for sure o and the fact that knoddy is alive was predictable not a surprise with no batman and superman to flirt with wonder woman had to have a love interest

You know she shoehorned in that scene where she saves the arab kid

This movie was so bad.

Possibly the greatest movie trailer ever made.

Rick and morty anyone ? 

One of the best trailers I&#39;ve ever seen.. the movie though a bit disappointing. Not terrible,  just didn&#39;t live up to the hype. Godot is still amazing all the same.

i&#39;l check this

ww 84 is a very dumb movie

Although the movie is bad but this trailer has SS tier editing

THIS JUST CAME OUT ON NETFLIX, AND I WATCHING KEEP ME WONDERING IF SUPERMAN IS ALREADY ON EARTH DURING 1984! HE COULD HAVE HELPED DIANA. 
Movie spent waaaaaaaaay to much time on Max Lord and Pascal&#39;s goofy wig. Way too much.

This trailer is slightly ruined by the movie... still awesome trailer

Fight scenes in first movie a million times better. First movie was a classic this one was just plain aweful especially cgi

I am not a DC fan, prefer Marvel. However I loved the first Wonder Woman movie. I was so exited when a second movie was announced. And God so dissapointed when I saw the movie... I have seen it once and that was more than enough!

Trailer lot better than movie!

This trailer looks so dope!! Especially when she swings from lightning but the part where she gracefully falls after flipping a truch is dumb af!

Pou
<a href="">1:37</a> excuse me?

Thor love and thunder and wonder woman 84 have one in common .Trailer which is far far better than the actual movie

DC is for a bunch of woke losers

i wish the film was atleast 1% of this trailer

Total disaster of a movie. Had a good sleep in the middle. Pure drivel.

This song is dope.. too bad the movie wasn&#39;t the best

The trailer looks like a song from the 80 &#39;s dont know about the movie didnt watch it

The movie is worthless but the music is nice to listen to :D
If the movie had been replaced by this trailer, just played 36 times in a loop for a 90 minute run time, it&#39;d have reviewed better than the movie did.

 this trailer still gets me hyped up

This is really a good movie.

The song is so good

Terrific trailer for a poorly written and directed movie.

Whoever wished for this movie to stream on Netflix should renounce.  The price is too high.

Wonder how many innocent Palestinians gal Godot murdered?

We need an all amazon movie

So far it is the best superhero trailer there is 
Gal Gadit, haha

The trailer is awesome. The film was just average
42M ? Thats Great

Such a great trailer for such a terrible movie

This movie is an atrocity

I want to see part 3.
<a href="">1:17</a> is from where the real magic begins 

Maybe the film sucks. But the trailer is one of the best I&#39;ve ever seen.

great job
The trailer comes from the movie itself, people.

Shame that covid-19 affected its box office.. it was a highly anticipated film..

Daamn Blue Monday save this trailer

Who came in 2022 especially for the music... hans zimmer + blue Monday 

It is soooooo 1984. ^^

Trailer is better than the movie

You know what&#39;s worst than a bad movie? A bad movie with a very much promising trailer...

Loved the film. Cheaters arc well acted by Kristen Wiig. Agreed slightly too long but a fun watch

I Love Wonder Woman 
When I think back on these timesAnd the dreams we left behindI&#39;ll be glad &#39;cause I was blessed to get to have you in my lifeWhen I look back on these daysI look and see your faceYou were right there for meIn my dreams, I&#39;ll always see you soar above the skyIn my heart, there&#39;ll always be a place for you for all my lifeI&#39;ll keep a part of you with meAnd everywhere I am, there you&#39;ll beAnd everywhere I am, there you&#39;ll beWell, you showed me how it feelsTo feel the sky within my reachAnd I always will remember all the strength you gave to meYour love made me make it throughOh, I owe so much to youYou were right there for meIn my dreams, I&#39;ll always see you soar above the skyIn my heart, there&#39;ll always be a place for you for all my lifeI&#39;ll keep a part of you with meAnd everywhere I am, there you&#39;ll be&#39;Cause I always saw you in my light, my strengthAnd I wanna thank you now for all the waysYou were right there for me (You were right there for me)You were right there for meFor alwaysIn my dreams, I&#39;ll always see you soar above the skyIn my heart, there&#39;ll always be a place for you for all my lifeI&#39;ll keep a part of you with meAnd everywhere I am, there you&#39;ll beAnd everywhere I am, there you&#39;ll beThere you&#39;ll be

This movie was not bad at all. I actually liked it more than most superhero films. People just expected the wrong thing, the thing the movie was trying to get across and did, was/is that Diana/WW has a big heart, simple yes? But effective. We don&#39;t always need 3 Spider-Men, epic Superman yells, snarky Stark comments,etc. The basics work fine at times.

Every Mother Is A Wonder Womb

Wonder Woman Is Every Mother

WONDER WOMAN COMES IN EVERY COLOR SHAPE AND SIZE...SHE IS A WOMAN!

And Gal Gadot's nude?
1917 is much better

<a href="">20:45</a>

Trailer was better than the movie

Trailer is better than the movie

Saw el movie.  So her invisible jet is stolen property?

This trailer is too good. Just came back to watch this again.

Great Movie. Better then others Movies!

I think this movie is realy a very nice superhero-movie.  I think the story was very interesting and i really love Wonder Woman 1984

I am from india . Today I have watch this wounder women movie it&#39;s really awesome didn&#39;t miss this movie guy.I really loves diana acting in this movie

The trailer was better than the movie.

IDGAF  I ENJOYED THIS MORE THAN THE FIRST ONEÔ∏è
Still refuse to watch the movie but love watching this trailer

I saw it recently and I liked it and I was like that  when I thought that the bad man was going to become an epic monster
I come here for the badass music

After the amazing first movie, this film was the biggest disappointment to hit the screens this decade 

I just seen this movie, I want my 2 hours and 31 min back!

Is this the same mall on stranger things? Hahaha <a href="">0:34</a>

Garbage film

That final moment Diana had with Steve reminded me of my first, wonderful love - Lady Christine Ô∏è

Incredible trailer. Ridiculous movie. I watch that movie because of the trailer and of this amazing version of Blue Monday, which is NOT on the movie, by the way.

Loved the movie.... That diana leaving Steve scene was one of the best movie scenes ever.. Wished there were more 80s music in it

<a href="">0:58</a>

The reason Gal Gadot got the part to play Wonder Woman because she wonders where her homeland is and if Israel is the land for Jews or its Palestine the land of 3 main religions. Jews, Christians and Muslims. And not the land of Zionist.üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏ 

@Warner Bros.... Please help videos I have shared go viral... Someone is blocking mi channel and videos and comments .  I am a former undercover mi six specialoperative, blown and burned and denied,  2 decades Retired. Argilles Forever!

While the start was very slow, I don&#39;t really understand why people don&#39;t like this movie all that much. I get that its stupid at times, very slow, and also is quite boring at certain parts, but after all of that, I thought the 2 villains were great and I enjoyed the whole wish story plot. But yeah if people are talking about the first half of the movie being kind of mid I definitely agree.

Fiku√¨f
Yes, this was a complete disaster.  But at least the song &quot;Blue Monday&quot; remixed by Sebastian B√∂hm was SO EPIC compared to the original!

This theme song seems familiar to Carbon based lifeforms supersede 

Trailer: goodMovie: bad

80&#39;s works!

My go to for therapy

Fantastic
Everything is so perfect in this trailer. One of the best ever...

Are there two versions of the wonder woman movie or two different movies? I&#39;m confused

I actually forgot this movie existed

Why did this show up on my feed?! Still garbage

This was a good movie, the part at <a href="">1:50</a> was very cool.

I can just watch this trailer over and over again.

ok

trailer and music delivered. the movie flopped.

Greatest movie ever made
This song is 100x better than the WW84

The way Steve punched him though

Movie was terrible. This trailer still slaps.

What junk this movie is.This director is only.being know because she&#39;s in with the feminist crowd and now she will.ruin rogue squadron.

I watched this scary and amazing movie and  this lady rescue the world and  fighting by another lady with powers and flying like a  superhero and running sooo fast and i just love this movie so much and this movie is the best for ever in the world oh my goodness 10000000/10

I play this to build my confidence at times.

STILL one of the greatest trailers ever made. IDGAF if you didn&#39;t like the movie, the trailer was something else. 41M views, WOW.

Horrible film and certainly one of the worst sequels ever.

Pedrito Pascal Ô∏è
Best part of the movie was this song in this trailer.

Best DCU trailer ever tbh
i come for the song, then leave...

This is the only movie I can think of where the trailer is significantly better than the movie.

Love this trailer . . . the movie was pretty good too.

Its a best trailer ever...

AAAAA I LOVE THIS SO MUCH

Why people think this movie is bad?

I think looking back at the trailer there&#39;s really not much going on here.  The musical tones and editting really make a lot out of not a whole lot happening.  Some generic villain lines and vague hero stuff.  It&#39;s the <b>idea</b> and the tone of the music that conveys the excitement but the substance within it is utterly lacking.

Worst than 1st movie.

It&#39;s just a trash can haha.  That&#39;s a good one. At the end.

DC try to use this iconic song/music for ww movie but it didnt work they way Marvel did. Nice try I guess.

What a music

Yeah just came back after 2 years  to watch this amazing trailer...

just here to say that I‚Äôm back 2 years later watching the trailer because it‚Äôs so perfect

June 5th, 2020.    Where&#39;s the movie?

Garbage

Epic and fun, with the heart and the intentional cheesiness of older comic book movies. Loved it.

It&#39;s good, it but could have been better.

Literally 1984

The best thing of WW84 is this trailer!

Still the best trailer i ever seen !

The sad fact of the matter is that this trailer is better then the entire movie

The film may have been a flop but the trailer, music and BGM are amazing.

Even worse than a regular BOLLYWOOD movie, they surely did a job with this trailor. What a disasterclass of waste of time this movie is...

I watched the movie and was entertained.It‚Äôs a movie, what else do you expect?Too many people expecting a movie to dramatically change their lives and then get disappointed?

Little girl Diana performaned very well in the movie

The best part of this unmitigated disaster of a movie was the trailer.

DVD collection part and Wikipedia Chinese version Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice Suicide Squad Hmm .   Release Justice league early even we have Wonder Woman and Shazam Aquaman is after Justice league .    Will unless JJ Abram Idea on Superman is fine ,  watching the video and read the all page Canceled Superman movie Superman Fly By .   In between Aquaman and Shazam Wonder Woman is just fine ,  related it version Man Of Steel 2 .    Silent part Sword and Axe saving Cyborg SteepenWolf second attack .

Fine I learned my lesson ‚Ä¶.. but Instagram mention Robert Pattinson VS Ben Affleck half of Zack Snyder plan was just fine .  Writer idea Copy and original .   3 Zack Snyder Video on YouTube ,  maybe because in between The New 52 and Earth 1 have some stuff that fan care about vote for Zack Snyder and Patty Jenkins .   The only squeal in the DCEU ,  Timeline before Steve and Ares .    Rewatched Trailer The Batman Justice league

I&#39;m convinced that whoever made this is the exact same person/team behind the He-Man teaser.

That actress should have hired a accent coach come on people. So wonder woman comes from china I guess?

first wonder women movie is a master piece, this one sucks, but the trailer is really good

Great movie, watch it everyone! :)

Wonder Woman will be played by Laverne Cox.

This trailer sold me dreams and that is why i can never forgive them

The guy who edited this trailer deserves an Oscar. The guy who directed the film deserves a Razzie.

This film was treated unfairly by critics. BUT I have only seen it twice, while I&#39;ve watched the trailer a bazillion times.

Film is like trash can, saying its art might induce people to watch it. Like this trailer.

I‚Äôll never forgive them for getting me so hyped for this then kicking me in the balls for 2 and a half hours

When the trailer is way better and exciting than the movie itself 

100x times better than no way home.

Still goosebumps!!?
This trailer seriously hyped me back then. But the story was really dumb

the trailer was very goodthe movie sucked

I remember seeing this at DC fandom and consistently watching this till the movie came out. The pure hype I had 

This trailer, this soundtrack is absolutely amazing but shame the movie did not live up to this . The music is beyond the pale!

Classic 
Presentation , And then out of nowhere..0, miracle 
WHEN WAS THERE A SECOND WONDER WOMAN MOVIE!?!

Does anyone else think it‚Äôs odd that she sleeps with some random guy, completely without his consent. She essentially rapes him.

<b>Yes they fooled us with this one trailer</b>

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all art‚Äù<b>Looks at WW 1984</b>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a trash can‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,it‚Äôs a trash can‚Äù

Too bad the trailer wasn&#39;t bad and the movie good

I love the trailer and the song!

Gal Gadot and Chris pine, so much beautiful lovely chemistry!

Love it!!

i totally missed this movie coming out 2 years ago!! and not for nothing , its really mediocre , i hate all the cringey-family-friendly-marvel-level type stuff , they better take a lesson and make dc&#39;s movies serious like they supposed to be

I was so hyped after the first Wonder Woman movie and then this movie came out and it was so bad... such a shame, I really wanted another good Wonder Woman story

The trailer looks so classy but after watching the whole movie was so ..I really really really  it. This is not a typical superhero movie. It shows how powerful humanity is that even gods feared us. 

The script was great but the plot was lame. Every scene could be better with more intense and creativity. Geoff johns should understand about this. But the good thing is with maxwell lord got his power the next sequel should be omac project - sacriface which lead to infinity crisis

So badly written

You can say anything about how bad this movie is, but this trailer is a piece of art. Perfect music, perfect editing, its sells the movie like no other trailer in recent memory. Two years later I still come back to it and have goosebumbs all over by body.

i like Blue Monday better than the Water Tower. no offense.

DC: WW84 is going to be released ...as a trailer.

Why are all these superhero women portrayed by rail thin hollywood types? In the comics these women are muscular and fit, at least get a cross fitter or female physique competitor if you&#39;re going to make comic heroine movies.

I Would Say Worst Movie I&#39;ve Seen, Worst Ending Totally Boring 

It is pretty sure ..you people haven&#39;t watched my youtube video long ago.. ethokke thanne athillum paranjirrunnathu ..ningalkku ahaana Krishna ethra cherruppu vangi..Pearle maani tomato rice undaakiyo..ee thenga kola kannane ale nerrammullu

NOW I CAN OFFICIALLY TELL THAT I AM NOT A HUMAN LIKE YOU

I was feeling guilty after watching this movie .. like I thought this is all needed to prove the world...but now I know the only thing required is the existence of ultimate power within me

As a Saint Seiya fan, the Sagittarius gold cloth in this trailer had me geeking all over. Obviously disappointed in the movie, but freaking cool nonetheless.

Still pissed that they never used this song in the actual film. It takes place in the 80s. Epic songs could have been used, but weren&#39;t.

at least the trailers and posters were good jsjsjs
Trailer &gt; actual movie

is this good

This movie doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate it gets.

Gal&#39;s legs. Nuff&#39; said.
I feel like you could 100% bring back Cheetah in WW3 (if it gets made thanks to what this pile actually turned out to be). You could have Kristin Wiig in old makeup finding a magical dagger or some such (&quot;It demands a sacrifice.&quot; Then she kills some sherpa/guide who helped her find it) to turn herself back into the Cheetah. And you could have a moment where Diana is talking to her like &quot;But why?&quot; And she says something like &quot;When Max renounced his wish it undid my wish. I NEVER renounced my wish, Diana. You got to go back to living your perfect, amazing life and I went back to being nothing. THIS is what I was always meant to be and YOU TOOK IT FROM ME! And I won&#39;t let you take it again.&quot; Cue fight scene.

When the trailer is better than the movie

I still remember the excitement I had the first time I saw this.one of the best trailers!

I&#39;ve watched this movie. It&#39;s 8/10

I feel like I&#39;m the only one who liked this movie.

Except for the plot and the Cheetah, this is a nice movie

Still gives me goose bumps.
Blue Monday....never forgot
Wonder Woman 2 should have been placed in the 2nd world war! Can you imagine! And no, this is actually serious, IMAGINE HER REACTION OT THE HOLOCAUST! Wonder Woman is such a believer of peace that her seeing something like that, especially to the children in the camps would probably literally break her from the inside out! And any movie like that would be a lot more memorable because Gal Gadot is Jewish (I think)

Wonder woman all art  Trevor looks at trash can Wonder woman that just a trash can

Wonder woman Nothing good is born from lies and greatness is not what you think

This is legitimately the greatest &quot;trailer to movie quality gap&quot; in history and will likely never be topped. This is without a doubt one of the top ten best trailers ever crafted by mankind, tied to a movie that is downright bad, not just mediocre but a plot hole riddled mess that I honestly don&#39;t even want to watch again. If anyone in Hollywood has any brains they&#39;ll give the person or people who made this trailer as much work as they can handle because they could probably make Plan 9 from Outer Space look like Casablanca given two minutes and 30 seconds.

2022/3/8 Ô∏è
I here again 2 year later for the song , it goes so well with the trailer

Concept and the story makes it a kids movie, not fit in the DC. Good budget and good cinematography is not enough for a movie to be good. I just watched Batman 2022, and if Batman is 92 out of 100, this movie is 20 out of hundred. The stone and the tiger girl, I still lmao when I think about that in a mature movie.

Haven&#39;t seen the movie yet. I think I&#39;ll just watch the trailer

Waiting for Wonder Woman 3      :D

<a href="">2:18</a> It‚Äôs Just A Trash Can 
Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)<a href="">eye.netizenn.one</a>mortals had appreciated such a beautiful woman.

I&#39;ll pretend this abyssmal movie never released and keep looking forward to it because of how promising this amazing trailer makes it look.

I love this movie

Gal maam please act  better 

When the trailer is better than the actual movie

This movie wasn‚Äôt that bad, I hope they make a third film.

How are you

I just realized the music is New Order&#39;s Blue Monday but a little more intense.

Beautiful Actress
Can&#39;t believe this is 2 yrs ago, how <a href="">times.flies.so</a> fast

the editor nailed this trailer, New Order&#39;s Blue Monday as soundtrack - at least for this promo - is perfect, and at the end, the use of the original <a href="">2:07</a> was spon on

<a href="">1:39</a> is still my favorite part

when trailer is better than movie

Why she has a brighter color suit in WW84

Gal Gadot will always be the most beautiful woman in the world, no matter what year it is.

I know everyone hates this movie. That is something I will never understand, for me, this is a beautiful and emotional movie. It can be better? Yes, but I really appreciate it and love it as it is.

One of the worst concept of a movie‚Ä¶

I just pretend this awesome trailer came out and then the awful movie was never released.

Even though the movie received a negative feedback. But I tried to watch it anyway to prove them wrong and it just their own personal opinion. But guess what this movie sucks so bad and too much  unnecessary emotional scene and the emotional scene dragging way too long. THIS MOVIE SUCKS AND WAY TOO LONG. All of the characters were not memorable. If you have insomnia. Please watch this movie i recommend it.

The least credible villain, everybody loves this guy

&quot;Nothing good is born from lies&quot;

woow blue monday by new order

Say what you will about the movie itself, but the trailer is still fantastic. Also, that kick at <a href="">1:50</a> as she grabs the other guy&#39;s arm while swinging the lasso, wow.

I do not care what the others say, I think this movie was great  ;)

Wow

This movie is the most forgettable DC movie.

Kim Geon-hee, stay strong!
&quot;it&#39;s all art&quot;.

<b><i>Whoever edited this trailer should have been the one to edit the movie. For example &quot;Pretty Woman was supposed to be about a drug addict but the editor made it into a Romantic Love Story Master Piece. The editor of this trailer would have made this WW84 a lifelong Classic like Pretty Woman.</i></b>

Who came here for Mishko boyka after watching movie Queen

I love this trailer 2022 

I reallt hope a director cut of this

The movie might&#39;ve trash, but that won&#39;t stop me from watching this masterpiece.

I remember watching the trailer in 2019 thinking &quot;This movie will be amazing, 2020 is going to be such a good year...&quot; Man was I wrong...

A woman rarely finds a man who is shorter, weaker and less wealthy than herself attractive.

I think patty Jenkins didn&#39;t understand the character of wonder woman. The personality of the character feels so much different as compare to bvs and Snyder cut . I think Zack Snyder  understand the interpretation of this character. The way he portrayed her is nothing compare to what we saw in ww84.

‚ÄãWhen we don&#39;t let God play with our genitals the Fake News calls it Covid. God controls mens genitals and creates them like the statue of David 

What a good trailer, and what a shit it came out in theaters.
Big fan of the first film, but this one was a little too full of SJW politics for my liking.

This trailer got millions of views on the music alone

I&#39;m here only for enjoying  Back Ground Sound Track 

She was actually fighting in the White House in this movie. I think it inspired January 6th.

The movie was such a lie though...

How is the trailer so good, but the movie is so trash at the same time? :(

I loved the movie, far from suitable for pigeon-hole tastes. Really intense. 10/10
Man, I&#39;m in minority with this one but this movie wasn&#39;t that bad. The first movie&#39;s success was partially because of the balance between &quot;Diana - bringer of hope and sunshine&quot; and &quot;Diana - the fierce warrior&quot;. Here the scale has been tipped off way too much towards the first aspect and that&#39;s where the movie&#39;s flaws came from. But this just proves that Patty Jenkins needs someone to bounce her ideas off for the story and third movie will definitely close off this trilogy on the positive note :)

Gal Dildo is a terrible actress

So, Maxwell Lord turns himself into a billionaire and his ex-wife still doesn&#39;t want him back? What is wrong with that woman?!

Couldn&#39;t agree more. The movie was forced to literally drown in that &#39;wallpaper for the ears&#39; hero movie music. The music from the trailer on the other hand completely sizzles!

it‚Äôs a shame because this trailer looks so epic and awesome but the film ended up being quite disappointing

What an epic piece of absolute garbage.

The trailer is better than the movie!!!!

imagine Zach Snyder directed this movie

This trailer is better than the movie. Wish I just stuck to the trailer

The dumbest movie ever

ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Value investment proposition?

RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Value investment proposition?

Why is Patty Jenkins still attached to direct WW3? She fluked the first one, showed she is a poor director with the TURKEY WW84. Why does the film company not replace her with a top notch Director for the 3rd movie?????

Whoever made

The Trailer : &quot;its all art&quot;The Movie : &quot; thats just a trash can &quot;

Wait, two years since this trailer was released ? 
Still enjoying the trailer

Happy 1st birthday Wonder Woman 198425th December 2020 - 16th December 2021
You have to make more movies cause this one leaves persons thinking that it&#39;s whoever grabs the Medea that governs the planet. &quot;tHAts like saying an icecream is just as good when it is only the cone you can have&quot;. YVO

I think Doctor Psycho should be in a future live action Wonder Woman movie.

If there is a third one, they should put Circe and Giganta in it and also Silver Swan.

still watching this trailer in 2021, best trailer hands down.

Law of attraction.
Bad movie, good trailer.

that case when the trailer is better and more epic than the film‚ÄçÔ∏è
Yes, you&#39;re right, nothing good is born from lies. Diana, Steve was gone a long time ago. Let it go. Apparently, audience has too.

The dude or dudette that made this trailer so got a raise for this trailer. So much better than the movie.

When you enjoy the trailer more than the movie. . .

Chris Pine is the man!  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s nothing like the characters he plays.

After watching the movie it‚Äôs clear there are a number of shots in this trailer that were made only for the trailer lmao. (Swinging on lightning, new costume, etc)

This trailer is better than the movie was lol

One of the worst turds of the decade

What a chackslop

That bgm!

my favorite song on the trailer of my least favorite moviegod, i hate my life

I loved all the DCEU films quite honestly. This one is definetely no exception, especially it&#39;s predecessor. Love Wonder Woman and especially Gal

The best of the best

Waiting for this movie for 3 years since the announcement with all the promotions and the delays expecting for it to look so good like the first movie just to get a heck of a disappointment. It&#39;s like a slap in the face

26 november 2021 watch it !

<a href="">2:07</a> - Music Vera 11.

I‚Äôm in love with Blue Monday. The song is so good 

Trailer <del>beast Movie</del> sucks

Love for Gal Gadot from India

I love Gal Gadot very much

The trailer: It&#39;s all artThe movie: Uh, that&#39;s just a trash can

Man I wish the movie was as good as this trailer.But I have faith in the next one

Diana and Alana

The URL of this trailer has 84 at the end of it

this is such badass trailer ugh

Why does this MOVIE on IMBD have a Metascore - 60???  It does not deserve it.

I like

&quot;languages are my forte&quot;  yet you have a stu pid thick accent

Give whoever made this trailer a raise!It was 100% better than the movie!!!!

This movie needs a Snyder cut

The theme music is just litIts giving goosebumps every time.Especially in the end

Terrible movie. The story was bad, the CGI was bad and you don&#39;t even see Cheetah until the very end in a fight scene that&#39;s clumsy af, poorly lit and over in just a few minutes. Zack was actually supposed to produce WW84, as he did the first one, but Patty got him removed and then WB DC gave her full creative control which has lead to this pile of  sequel. Loved the first one but this one is rubbish. I hope they reign her back a bit with the next sequel.

Diana: &quot;Nothing good is born from lies&quot;Me: This movie is a damn lie

PERFECTION TRAILER &amp; MOVIE! Ô∏è
This film was very misleading
Very nice

For anyone wondering about the song in the backround it is Blue Monday

I remembered why I got disappointed on the movie  it was because how she just took the armor out of her closet 

Legal 
I still haven't seen it...
This trailer gave me goosebumps. The movie however, did not. 

Red notice

This trailer gives me trust issues now. This is one of my fave trailer and is so hype. Hyping me up for the movie that I felt nothing except for when she took back her wish. This movie was so disappointing and fell way below the first one

Those who hate it are always the people who expect to much.

One of the worst films I have ever seen.

- Its Steve- In &#39;80s clothes with shoulder pads!!!- He&#39;s still Steve- Change him back!!!

Hey, at least we can all agree that Gal is perfect and the &#39;80s was the best decade ever!

Didn&#39;t like the movie.Love the trailer

the only good thing about this movie was how much the camera focused on gal gadots legs

Excellent trailer, I want to see it many times because, as they say, the second parts of movies are more interesting than the first parts.
The trailer was much better that the movie...

<a href="">#ww84</a>

<a href="">1:50</a>

Trailer is better than the movie.

So now ww is spiderman 

Feminist poison. I prefer anything actually from the 80&#39;s, not this rewritten history. The dude needs Star Trek to find his masculinity again if there&#39;s any left. Punk loser!

I hated this movie but trailer is incredible

Incredible movie. I cried so much at some point. Very touching and the it has a good moral value to learn from it. I recommend you watch it if you haven‚Äôt already.

She became Supergirl 

1st WW was great, the WW from BVS and <a href="">#Snydercut</a> was great....but this garbage of a movie was bad. Good actors, good soundtrack, but the script was really really bad. DC and WB, stop being Marvel, do your own stuff....be different.

Whoever directed this need to do all the dc movies this looks better than every movie dc has dropped in recent times

The show is just &quot; SO...SO&quot; like a cheap movie of low budget movie. Lack luster story line  I was disappointed with the movie. More like fashion show than a superhero action movie. However the recent Spiderman 3 story line  is so much better. I am looking forward to James bond movie soon.

Oh No..They are going to make Wonder Woman 3. Please dont...the sequel is already bad enough.

Gal Gadot jokingly suggested Halle Berry to play Diana&#39;s love interest for this film.Gal Gadot&#39;s makeup was done using only Revlon products.Barbara is the Greek word for &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot;. Minerva is the Roman goddess of wisdom. So the name Barbara Minerva might be read as &quot;strange wisdom&quot; or &quot;foreign wisdom.&quot;According to Patty Jenkins, the controversial &#39;body-swap&#39; subplot was intended to be a reference towards some of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s classics, such as Freaky Friday (1976) and Big (1988).The symbol of Nuclear Man from Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) can be seen on the floor of the mall. Patty Jenkins picked the 80s as the film&#39;s setting because she saw it as &quot;the height of Western civilization and society, and so it offers the opportunity to explore how Wonder Woman would deal with the types of villains that come from that era.&quot;Diana uses her tiara as a boomerang. This was a feat she performed in Wonder Woman (1975).Gal Gadot&#39;s family and Patty Jenkins&#39; son have a cameo at the end of the film: Gadot&#39;s elder daughter and Jenkins&#39; son throw a snowball at her, and Gadot&#39;s younger daughter and husband appear on the carousel.The character of Maxwell Lord was based on actor Sam Neill when introduced in DC Comics in 1987.Composer Hans Zimmer and costume designer Lindy Hemming both worked on Christopher Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight trilogy.

Say what you will about the movie, this trailer was phenomenal

Great trailer and the movie is thoroughly enjoyable too, I&#39;m not gonna jump on the haters bandwagon.

This movie really moved me. I really enjoyed it at the cinemas the first time when it was released and enjoyed it even more the 2nd time on streaming.

#3 on the Top 5 list of Trailers of All Time Better than the Film.

This is amazing entertainment what movie awesome   love that dialogue life is good but it can be better

Worst movie EVER of the last 10 years

This movie is a perfect example of go woke, go broke. Over 2 hours of my life in the trash can.

P√órn is the only time the actual movie is better than the trailer.

&#39;&#39;next summer&#39;&#39;

Terrible movie.
Shield? Sword? Not the only things missing, a story and script would&#39;ve been nice!

Its a good movie, the lessons, the moral delimma, the quotes, the powerful words they used. Yeah its not something very bloody action packed movie, but this movie deserves more. The scene diana run and renounce her wish, gives me goosebumps. Respect to the creators. Some people don&#39;t understand what a good movie is. Sad

If only I‚Äôd enjoyed the film as much as the trailer.

<b>Trailer is good than movie</b>

This movie is Josstice league level, but with less cringe and no logic lmao

I don&#39;t care how hard this movie was pannedI love it

it‚Äôs called Dark Comic not bright comic , fkin stupid warner bruh

Too bad the movie not as epic as the trailer

Trailer was so good that the movie didnt come to par.

great movie!
Anyway, I still love this movie.

Easter Eggs: In the movie towards the end. A red balloon was released. Maybe and ode to the Nina song 99 red balloons which was released in USA in 1984. Red balloons being released is a symbol/message that the war is over. Another Easter egg was when she is Riding the Lighting. If your a fan of Metallica then you should know the album Ride the Lighting came out in 1984. This are just my own Easter eggs. Not facts just coincidental.

Still waiting for the actual Wonder Woman sequel on how she killed another creator from another world. This one doesn&#39;t exist in my book

This one was really awful. Silly storyline like a tv cartoon, pointless scenes. Frustrating, wasted potential, disappointed.

I watched trailer more than 50 times just for that music

Damn first Suicide Squad and then this. Good trailers and bad movies

Man I was so hyped but here we are

What a huge step backwards quality wise. What a terrible film. With a ridiculous amount of plot holes you could drive a bus through. Embarrassing.

That&#39;s the coolest trailer and music combo I&#39;ve ever seen 

Oh don‚Äôt I wish I only watched the trailer but not the movie?

Ok call me dumb but 1984? More like 2000s or does the movie take place in 1984? I am literally confused!!

The movie sucked but this trailer is a master piece

I come back here every month just for the music. Anyone else?

The trailer was amazing, but the movie sucked. Lmao.

Man, what a movie!!!

the only thing that made me like this movie is when steve and diana had to say their last goodbyes again.

When the trailer is better than the movie

I can&#39;t wait to see the third installment!!

IDK WHY THIS MOVIE GOT SO MUCH HATE I loved it, the music, the story, the villains, and what got me tearing up was the relationship Maxwell has with his son

Why it performed so badly?

Terrible film

This film was absolutely dire. Poor script, nonsensical plot supported by cringe-worthy acting. Two and a half hours of utter tripe.

WW(2017) : MasterpieceWW84: Just ok

This movie is not that bad like what everybody says. It&#39;s just that, the first movie set a high standard for the sequel.

God.. I love this movie so much

LMAO this movie sucked terribly. And I LOVE the DCEU

 Movie 
WW84 appreciation. 
No sword no warrior persona.... yeah fire patty Jenkins.

Wonder Whora 1984

Hahaha when your trailer has more action than your movie hahaha
This movie sucked and I LOVE Wonder Woman

Who sees it in August 2021?
here to watch the awesome trailer again because the movie was so disappointing.

Whoever cut this trailer with dope music needs a raise

I like the fact how in the first wonder woman movie steve is introducing diana to the outside world and in this it&#39;s her introducing the modern world to him.

‚ÄòNext Summer‚ÄôAbout that

Guess it&#39;s only me here  , here just for the background music xd

This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

When the trailer was good but the movie wasn&#39;t :(

This movie was shotvon film

I‚Äôve seen this movie at the AMC Theaters at Disney World on December 31st, 2020

Is the mall shown in starting the same starcourt mall from stranger things?

This music (beat) was actually in vogue from the late 1970s to the very early 1980s.  Say 1978 -1982.  By 1984 it would have been considered somewhat dated.

what a huge dissapointment

This film is trash can,, yeah yeah

Wow, that&#39;s a good looking movie, Wonder Woman is ready for 80&#39;s.

They didn&#39;t even use this soundtrack in the movie. Really bad movie but this tune is beyond awesome!

another hollywood CGI nightmare cashing in on the 80s. OMG...what a mess of a movie...totally stupid and incoherent ...i love gal and the first ww movie...and was so looking forward to seeing her again... i will give her a pass...but yes the people who put this mess together should be fired.. 2 and half hours ugh.....

Movie was shite

The movie sucked and this chick as wonder woman, sucked and her acting !

Wow Diana Wonder Woman vs  Guys bad Diana prince Amazon dc 1984
The movie is long and a mess, but I found it enjoyable. I hope I am not the only one who thinks that.

OMG i just rented the DVD and this movie was written for a 2 year old. The movie was absolutely HORRIBLE. I wish I could reclaim my time.

Does anyone know who the trailer editor was?  Super impressed.

I just watched the movie. I didn&#39;t understand how the stone went into his body,  seems like it needs something different.

3rd class movie that I ever seen

The Russians spetsnaz should of attacked the Mall.

Man this movie is trash

trailer is epic...but the movie...why, DC????

This trailer is better than the whole film

I think what they did wrong with this movie is that they tried to handle too many stories in a single movies and also they seriously screwed up the ending

Life is good! this movie could have been better!

I hate how the trailer was better than the movie

ùó°ùó∂ùó∞ùó≤, 
Alternatively titled, &quot;Wonder Woman rapes a stranger.&quot;  Unbelievable.

This gets my Vote was BEST trailer EVER for a movie that unfortunately sucked. THUMBS UP to the trailer though!

If there is a heaven, I hope it‚Äôs me providing an eternal mustache ride  for Gal.

This is honestly one of thee worst movies ever made! Couldn&#39;t even get past the first 2omin.

Wonder Woman using the Lasso of Hestia to swing on lightning bolts?!  Thor being able to create it with and without the use of his Mjolnir or Stormbreaker? Zuko, his sister Azula, and their father Ozai channeling the energy and then redirecting it? To be able to create, control, even master the elemental power itself is a force to be reckoned with!!!!

great great trailer ....BUT I was a bit disappointed the movie turned out to be an uncoordinated hot mess !  Anyone else feel the same ?

Gal gadot is too pretty to be a hero...i wish a better actress can somehow steal her roles as WW...she doesnt look badass at all

I&#39;ve been watching this trailer so many times that I start to believe I am Wonder Woman. Is it okay?

I&#39;ve never seen a worse actress than Gal Gadot. She can&#39;t act.

Everyone wanting everything and believing they have the right to: great ideology for building chaos

For the feminists

Art = this trailer Trash can = the actual movie.

amazing trailer, movie is a huge letdown

The trailer was better then the movie

literally

This soundtrack is better than the movie.

This movie made Justice League and BvS oscar worthy

the fact that this whole trailer is so much better than the movie

Its like the god finaly creat trailer

This Movie is a Big DC Line up Plan!!

DC movies used to be very long like 2 hrs, huh just with a little fun and long,, like this movie it&#39;s not even superhero movie it&#39;s more like a broke love story and a family,, DC sucks! It&#39;s superhero style and action are not too dramtic and it&#39;s so Meaning less, but the movies used to be very long, hahah i prefer Marvel, this DC things are so bad, it just had no meaning, and no futuristic and old fashioned powers,, like this movie, no much adventure and Fight scenes, even the fight scene is so simple,,

guys I haven&#39;t watched the movie, I was so looking forward to it bc of the trailer thanks a lot 

So epic
I watched it good movie

Trailer : 100% hypeMovie: 0%

Watching this now, free on Comcast, worst superhero movie.

movie boutta be dog
Still the best trailer of all time for one of the worst fall flat on it‚Äôs face movies of all time

Dear GAL <i>/\</i> The MAP other of ISRAEL when tilted 45 Degrees 2 the Right becomes a SWORD FiSHhhh ;-) SAK

garbage

This movie went on forever. So long and bloated.

using remix of blue monday    the editor is definitely a child of the 80s

Pedro looked like an 80s Tucker Carlson

By all the gods out there, those of my people, Ancient Greeks, and all the rest.. that film was truly.. unbearable.Even in fast forward.Even with Hans Zimmer soundtrack.Even with John Murphy&#39;s music.But people seemed to love it. Which PERFECTLY explains why Martin Scorsese was, well, very, very, VERY right.

Can we all agree that this doesn‚Äôt compare to the first Wonder Woman movie? To me this was a disappointment the first one was much better

I was born in 1984

I have many problems in Wonder Woman 1984

Okay, so I&#39;m not the only one disappointed in this movie. They lost me with the storyline. Make a wish. Really. I wish this was a better movie 

One of the best trailers for a movie ever, unfortunately the movie itself was a huge letdown!

It&#39;s like watching your wedding video after filing for a divorce.

Blue Monday by New Order: the song

No disrespect to Gal but the WW needs to end here. I want Gal to return as Giselle in FF. If they can resurrect Hans character they can resurrect Giselle&#39;s.

I like wonder woman wow wow
ilusao

I think it makes sense that WW can lasso lightning and clouds, and that she can glide on air currents. Her father is Zeus, the God of lightning and the skies.

What an awful movie. And they were green lit for a third movie... same writer. What a mess

Without hans zimmer means wonderwoman is nothing 100% true .

Honestly, the trailer is 100% better than the movie

One of the best trailers created. Epic soundtrack!

I sometimes want to come back to December 2019 when I still tough this movie was going to be amazing

Why is New Order on all Hollywood trailers now?

No shit.....if at least they had included some 80's songs,' given 1984 in the title of the FILM I would have given it a 6.... But alas it got a 5
That movie was so disappointing...

Actually this movie goes great with Blue Monday and Pink Floyd Learning how to fly

F U Gal Gadot
What a great trailer for such a dissapointing movie . . .BTW does anybody knows where can i get this song? Or what its based of?

1.42 now she is Spider-Man

Let‚Äôs be honest, this isn‚Äôt your first time here

Awesome trailer with music

I watched this movie today my feelings are, aare Bhai yeh to tatti Hain.

I remember seeing that movie in Limelight Cinema.

Perhaps the best superhero trailer ever.

This is a very different film to the first. It got a lot a backlash becauseit pulled to many consumerist driven conformists out of their fantasy of attaining something greater than the human dignity that they were born with.

Hinde dubbing bhajo bro full movie
This makes me happyFor not buying the movie...

Just like The Last Jedi trailer, this trailer is FAAAAR better than the movie. They used all of the good parts, and someone better than the director pieced it together.

Wonder woman in real life kills innocent kids

and for anybody that liked the movie please reconsider your life choices..

Literally couldn&#39;t watch it for more than 45 minutes asking myself why I didn&#39;t turn it off sooner but thats what happens when you invest some of your hard earned cash.(sunken cost effect). Junk!

looking a lot like 80s they

Parents, don‚Äôt let your young boys watch this. Every male in this movie is bad. What is wrong with Hollywood?

This could&#39;ve been so incredible

<a href="">#RestoreTheSnyderVerse</a>

What‚Äôs the opening song

Just watching it now and it&#39;s tremendous fun. I love the sleazeball trump conman narcissistic character in it. Firmly ensconced in history as when it was made. Nice detail.

I love Wonder Woman.
This has to go down as one of the biggest disappointments of the 21st century.  Such a good trailer...such as steaming pile of a movie.

Joss Whedon&#39;s Justice League is not canon

The Wonder Woman movie starts and within a few minutes one can see the changes made from the original.  The comments below confirm that this new release is a mere shadow of the  original. However this Trailer is good and has great energy, unfornately this is not repeated in the actual movie , which is very disappointing :(

I like how trailers make movies look so good but the movie itself is literally trash.

When a trailer is better than the whole movie.

I refused to watch this movie for about 10 months because of the bad reviews..watched it yesterday cause of boredom and the movie is absolutely fantastic..in the future I guess I wont take negative reviews so seriously

This movie was really great!

The trailer is better than the movie

Women

I'm waiting for the DVD. If it's available, I'll go buy it. If I'm not available to sell, I won't buy anything. Stumming like crazy! I grew up in the nineties and liked to watch big screens.
Today I got winder woman 1984 on dvd

cewek cantik

The effectiveness of this trailer guaranteed a big audience for the film...which saved Warner Brothers from having a disaster at the box office.

The trailer at 2 1/2 minutes is better than the whole 2 1/2 hour movie.

i would be very angry if some tall gorgeous supermodel amazon would have her way on me, while the spirit of her ex boyfriend is possessing my body.

isnt that mall from Stranger things?....

&quot;Nothing good is born from lies&quot;this trailer is a perfect example

How did this shitty movie pass through production to release

If only 80 songs like this one were in the movie

This was absolutely shit, should of threw in a wonder woman in a thong scene to atleast get a 1/10

This movie isnt as bad as people say tbh

And the film is interestingÔ∏è About how parents go to crime for the sake of a good life for the child, and the children only want attention. Well, about those who complex. These people need to be helped, because everyone can see what it will lead to, if they are ashamed of glasses, help with the choice of lenses, if a friend is struggling with excess weight, help, we all live on this planet and our future depends on everyone. But you need to help when you see that a person is suffering from it. Because many men wear glasses
Zach Snyder should&#39;ve directed this film....

Better than the movie

Sometimes I come back to this trailer and go, how the actual f‚Äî ... did they manage to screw this up?

When trailers are better than movies...

Just watched the movie, its incredible! Loved it!!!

<a href="">#RestoreTheSnyderVerse</a> ,no al Hamadaverse!!!
Raise your hand in the comments if you think the DCEU inproved itself with the Snyder cut after WW 84 happend

<b>The trailer is great, but the movie can be better</b>

wtf wonderwoman bleeds
02.08 where can I get this music

I just watched this movie &amp; oh my god it sucks Beyond all belief..!!  Wtf , how can the Director make the first wonder woman movie so good and then fail so miserably on the second one I almost didn‚Äôt believe the same Director had anything to do with part 2.  This is now got to be the worst DC movie of all time.  It didn‚Äôt even have any SJW bull shit it was just dumb &amp; silly  , terrible CGI , absolutely horrible writing , I think the director was high on Ambien

Now I want <a href="">#StudioCut</a>

Incredible movie. In wonder woman story 84, both Diana and her colleague Barbara represent two examples of the ego. Diana has to let go off her desire to bring back the dead bf represents her not accepting the truth and present moment that her bf is gone.  And her failure to see to use her unique gift to serve humanity. The character Barbara represents ego which feels &#39;little me&#39; and failure to recognize her gift.  Amazing movie explains the hero&#39;s journey in the most entertaining way. Thank you to the creative genius who came up with this idea!

I loved it! I give it 5 stars!

And they delayed this movie why?its soooo boring.<a href="">2:30</a> hours of bla bla bla ... the fisrt 10 minutes where interesting, after that sweet nap time ... waste of time

Tbh marvel could&#39;ve done this better. Nonetheless, I love DC

Marvel could&#39;ve done better  but I love D.C tho.Ô∏è

Loving the BG music!

Me after the trailer: &quot;Life is good.&quot;Me after the movie: &quot;...that could&#39;ve been better.&quot;

I dont know why most of people say this movie is trash, but i would say , it is a damn cool movie.

Dog shite movie...
Whoever is responsible for this movie should never work in the industry again. They just can&#39;t go with a storyline at all. Worst DC movie ever. And the first one was so good,

I personally find this type of venomous feminity to be revolting.  And to feature a young child as a spectacle at the beginning is inappropriate on all counts?  Completely and morally inconsiderate, insensitive, and insulting. Promulgating this type of prejudiced drivel should be illegal.

They sooo shouldve used this music in the movie

Awesome trailer... Dissapointing Movie.

The music we heard in the film?

I don‚Äôt care what anyone says! I loved this movie and how it embraced the craziness superhero became known for!
