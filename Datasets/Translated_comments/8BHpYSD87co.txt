Nee guda

Embarrassed to see Linc having to do this... His brother should rescue him

They really messed that character up. In the comic books Albrecht &quot;Baron&quot; Krieger was an enemy of Captain Marvel (Shazam nowadays since DC lost the right to its original name). Baron Krieger was initially named &quot;Captain Nazi&quot;, but that character was <b>NOT</b> a Mr. Hyde thing. He could easily overpower Atom and Vixen. Give them the aid of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, that still woudn&#39;t enough. To take down that character it required Shazam, or Superman, Green Lantern (the original one whose ring didn&#39;t work against wood), the Flash or something. Sad thing to see a character created that long ago, being that powerful, is made a fool of in this show. But still, better they make fools of the villains.Edit: <a href="">1:42</a> I don&#39;t really know why Krieger is running, I mean, that guy can fly. Why is he running instead?

This scene made me drop the show

Dead island 1 final boss fight be like

Andre Eriksen is also a legendary norwegian rapper from the group Warlocks.

this looks like a sci-fi original. DC really needs to step their game up.

UGH this BLOWS

This is what you gwt when you order the hulk on wish.

<a href="">00:43</a>

Pretty good for fan made amateur movie with no budget.

That’s an awful lot like the Hulk

He&#39;s like a perfect version of &quot;G&quot; which William Birkin could only dream for.

who took the armor off the armored titan

When you pull out the ps2 for nostalgia

THE WHITE HULK.....HMMPH

Wow he looks like the SS version of the hulk maybe SS hulkamania is next lol

Great.. I&#39;m off...

What is this? DC sold there rights to Nickalodian

Фрик альбинос из игры Жизнь после

The physics in this are absolutely awful.

He&#39;s not evil, just in pain. Those pants aren&#39;t elasticated and they must be cutting off his blood supply. All he wants is some help. :(

Что за позорная графика?

Love how the bombs blow up like nades

No way DC made up this bs. 

Ah the evil Nazi...again...Hollyweird  pls get another enemy this one is warn out

Hhhhhh very funny

I think DC Lego was better than this

God awful effects and animation.

Bro the audacity of them thinking this was good enough to put out. The Fuck is this, 1982?

What is this? Did the kangz of the short bus go into moviemaking?

Special Effects from the 90s 

Bro even the syringe looks like dogshit

It really looks like fan made.

These guys are being serious in their acting.. But it became hilarious because of the comments..  

His pants should have shattered completely.. .. Hmm.. Wonder why.. Just like Hulk&#39;s..

Steroids. My son

Cobra Kai, Nevera Day  Mister Jhoon Kresse 

What a stupid movie

Bad CGI

Feiao

Dc really needs to work on their cinema. Their stories and characters are ok, especially the main Justice League which are my favorite, but DC needs to work on their effects, their publishing, their directing, their plotting, their story writing… Nothing but love but I expect more

Que marca é essa calça?

And they say marvel cgi is bad

with that animation we got to the Oscars

What a fucking shit

Ну и кринж....

Super Nazi.

So he&#39;s DCs low budget hulk ripoff. Nice.

Que bosta de série. Horrível.

Dirty vfx

Dumb ass nonsense

This show is still on the air hahaha

Ьщ

They even butchered the Nazi Salute.

Когда затряслись кусты,думал появится эйсвентура с горилой)

Очередная чушь сказки поинтересней будут.

Man this was excruciatingly bad. Like who in the sweet fuck looked at this monstrosity of a production during test viewing and thought… “this will blow them away” 

looks awful

Horrible CGI/graphics. And he grimaces, growls and moves just like Hulk. Copycat anyone?

Olala c’est mauvais …

Amazing 

Them no know waetin to act again se .<a href="">#GodblessNigeria</a>

Spider-Man Lotus, a fan made film, has better CGI.

Still better than She-Hulk

Вот это шлак!

Prime reason I never watched this show after season 1 cheesy special effects. The story and actors are great though

Hulk solos

Bro, how are they becoming even worst than marvel?

It&#39;s the Red Hulks little brother! It&#39;s funny how he&#39;s an Army commander just like Ross LoLWhat&#39;s next a super strong man from another planet named &quot;Super Human&quot; who gets his strength from the Lunar light and his only weakness is a glowing blue rock they call Cripstonight!

What a joke 

Wtf is this? how are there 8 seasons of it?who watchs these? So many questions.....

hulk copy paste

Hulk on crack.

I think I&#39;ll just stay with cartoons and animes for now They seem more.... Mature?

This is a 2021 show…. This looks like some terrible CGI from 2001

This feels like a fever Dream, i still can&#39;t believe it actually happened.

Wtf is this

They musta had some talented grade school kids, cuz thats the peak of this quality 

This is hilarious

corny

what is the name of this injection

This is so amazing..... The action and CGI was even better than &quot;no way home&quot;It&#39;s &quot;No Way back.&quot; In my opinion.

It sucks

ну и говнище 

Bad cgi jokes aside - this character is an evil nazi steroid hulk??

3rd world CGI.

Well dat right there is the shitiest CGI u can imagine...

Что за шлак и отстойная графика?

Позорище какое то



Man, the enthusiasm came long before the doubt when they decided to pull the trigger on this dumpster fire.

DC is so embarrassing

<a href="">1:18</a> the sound 

German Hulk :D

Haha Baron Krieger... German super duper hero ;)

Wow just as shitty as she hulk

Too bad it&#39;s a cheap knockoffs of the Avengers. The creators can&#39;t even come up with their own ideas

Total vandalisation of the DC brand. Yikes.

Put this moron next to the Hulk!  the hulk will smash him.

And there are people who say She-hulks cgi is bad.

Red hulk look a like

HULK RIP OFF.. LOW BUDGET HULK.. OR WHAT CAN WE CALL THIS

Jesus christ fck I can&#39;t believe I ever liked the ArrowverseWhat in the actual fck was I thinking?

<b>Hulk versi low budget </b>

estamos en el año 2022 buck rogers, volver al futuro predijeron cosas maravillosas, pero ver esta animacion realmente me hace dudar de todo y pensar asi como la humanidad esta retrocediendo las animaciones, los videojuegos, las peliculas tambien?? que nos pasa ?? la degradacion no es solo cultural.

Пиздец какой-то

И что доктор волшебником был? Да нет, просто по любви не соскучился! Спасибо режиссеру - за большого парня!

He reminds me of that stretch armstrong toy but worse.

Graphics looks like they are made by twelve years old

Чушь полнейшая

Man, the framing and cinematography in these shows is always such shit. It’s like  high school kids did it.

Dam the guy you hear in the background sounds like a real winner. Not

Los fisculturistas de hoy <a href="">0:08</a>

When I ever watch these type of shows I feel like I am watching fan-made superhero movie on YouTube with a very minimum budget .

Хорошо сняли..

‍️‍️‍️

Какая же уебищная графика

I thought this was Super Buu with a new cut ..

CW makes constant shit. It’s always soap opera level acting and painful with watch.

lol why is this show still running? except for that the cast needs a job. in which case thank God it&#39;s still running but this is just really bad.

When I thought Solomon Grundy was DC&#39;s version of the Hulk boy was I wrong!!! Lol 

I want to see a fight between Hulk vs. This Guy

I can make this VFX for only 100$

Тот же самый халк

Что за х...?

That looks shite mind!

Ну и хрень, одно понравилось....когда он плюху выписал  тёлке в труханах из американского флага

Халк розовый

This is like power rangers for adults, a whole other level of subversion and subjugation. Hell all this could be happening right now but no consistent stream of accurate information coupled with everyone being emotionally invested in fake shows like this, really would be the perfect way to pull the wool over everybody’s eyes.

So he&#39;s like a German Hulk?!?!

Baron krieger is like mr hyde

Tell me you&#39;re trying to rip off Hulk without telling me you&#39;re ripping off Hulk

Hulk rip off

Is this avengers of justice: farce wars 2?

Qual nome do flimes?

Total movie budget = 500,000 pesos = 5$

Me gustaria que tubiera un cameo en doctor strange y que esa injeccion la modifiquen mediate la peli

This guy is addicted to the booster shots 

Why is bill gates flashed in @ :30 sec?

This shit is trash!!

Awful CGI

Acting is terrible, hits aren&#39;t connecting at all. You have to sell the fight. Pro wrestlers in WWE make fighting look much more realistic and violent than this.    Captain Nazi growls like a demon monster. Costumes make everybody look like a bunch of crazy LARPers.  CGI is pretty good.

is this hulk and the blitzkreig added

The audio for the character 

000001l220L0

Qué Hulk más raro...WTF!

The cgi is comical

God that looks terrible 

This issss......horrible

The funny part is he comes back when his shoes are still fitting him 

Shit shit so Wack and wHo pose to be “hero’s” “legend “ cause this is ass

The hell is is this crap

Coitado de Hulk na frente de Grandão.

Wtf

Still better than The Flash TV show&#39;s CGI

<a href="">0:12</a> The veins crawling up his head is way more creepier than the actual monster itself.

Y esto cuando pasó?

I think Jimmy Neutron did it better

This is the gheyest looking show.

что за шляпа

Вот это шлак!!

Какая же хромая графика!!!

Что за новое, сраное говно, наверное Марвел новый порожняк отснял 

Why didn&#39;t they just get a bodybuilder?

The CGI makes me cry Tfug they can release something like this nowadays

What kind of Indian movies are these? Hahahah

มึงถือไว้หาพ่อมึงหรอปืน

Yeah,y&#39;all out of pocket for this.

This isn&#39;t DC made

Es chistoso, porque crece de tamaño el tipo y también crecen sus pantalones y botas jajajajaja...

Oof..

Baby doll 



What a piece of crap

хахаха. Очередной отстой.

The animation and effects here are God awful

So fake  the makes trow up

This show is a fucking disgrace.



Never buy another pair of pants!

Looks like shit. And The animation is awful.

probably worst CGI I&#39;ve ever seen.. 

If they wanted a ripped Nazi should have just hired Arnie .

I lost interest in this show. Maybe I&#39;ll take another look

Such a nice shirt ruined like that. Should remove it before hulking up.

Deixei de assistir esse seriado só lacracao

Что эт бл за ёб@нь? 

Please film&#39;s name

Gotta love CW cgi budget

Is this a steroids commercial?

So DC stole The Hulk and painted him red?

low budget for dc trying make there own hulk lmfao

German hulk

Нефигово его штырит...

should we use our near endless budget to produce this ? nah just get it done on wish

Blondie Hulk copy

For real this is kiddish

Essas séries da DC parece cosplay

Amazingly put together. Just remember what happens when you piss off the One you wouldn&#39;t like angry. 

If CGI was done with MS Paint.

L.O.L

Just need Budget

oh shit I thought it was Red Hulk.

Hulk  made in chine

Good lawd that’s horrible

Close your eyes and watch this video.....sounds like you&#39;re watching The Avengers...

This makes me happy I stopped watching cw dc super hero shows

Un hombre increíble más creíble tomando en cuenta a la serial

What a crap cgi

Такой херни я больше нигде не видел.

Damn that&#39;s some real low budget effects there 



Holly shit. Watching this made me realize DC suck even more!!!

Que efectos tan pésimos invirtieron 5$ en este filme,pesimo

I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the most horrible of acting and special effect, but it&#39;s definitely in the threshold

What&#39;s Movies name

My god this is cringe

I seriously hope DC didn&#39;t make this.I don&#39;t mind the fact that it&#39;s on par with 1980&#39;s style action super hero T.V. shows.The CGI however is very out of place with an 80&#39;s like quality, superhero show.The rest of my criticism lies with all of the generic copy cat characters.  Especially the CGI Nazi Hulk.  For shame DC!!!&quot;Stick to Superman and Batman movies, DC Comics&quot;!

Which series is this

Reminds me of the rediculous African films cgi

Better CGI than Halo TV shitshow

Tosco

A poor version of hulk is what it looks like

Caramba, que negócio mal feito, parece jogo de Play Station 2

So this is the copycat version of the hulk..  a white terrible,weak version of hulk ?

This Guy is just like a Heroin addict

Wrong tint...it should be greeen

Muito show

DC&#39;s gamma steroids&#39;

The cgi is soooo bad shit reminds me of tge scorpion king from the mummy lol

<a href="">1:10</a> Who are those two?

Una reverenda cacaa boluuuu

What the ...? 

super corny and cheesy the show&#39;s trying to entertain seven-year-olds or insulting its viewer&#39;s intelligence I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m watching make-believe at all.

Uhm.......NO.

It&#39;s funny how there shirt always rips but there pants don&#39;t 

WHO ASKS QUESTIONS IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT? AND HE WAS CLEARLY RUNNING TWICE, IF NOT, THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THAT MOTORCYCLE.

Idk what to say about this.........sucks I guess.

Basically me as I exit Planet Fitness after working out

I think its better if they hire bigger man .. 8 feet guy.. and just put on make up..

This guy&#39;s a drug addict.

DC U has the worst cgi

Damn that was painful to watch

Мотоцикл Урал?

Pretty sad fight scene

You think this is awful? Lol try to watch Philippine series and movies  not all but almost everything  I&#39;m korean btw

This looks terrible

The budget for this is amazing, let alone the effects. Surprising I never watched it before. My only question is why do all large creatures have to growl and roar, especially while running?

Its like watching a 90s show

Cheap ass production

Did they spend $40 on their cgi? This show sucks.

And this is why I miss Blue&#39;s Clues

So this isn’t a real movie and home made?

That&#39;s what I call anabolic steroids.

what a trash

Hahaha! Wtf? 

The CGI fits to the actor skills :-D

This would be amazing if it was made 20 years ago. But 2016?? Cmon now, i myself am a gfx artist, and could probably do better than this.

oh damn that motercycle allmost made it to 40mp/h, my scooter can drive 65mp/h down a hill. So the guy got some steriods and now his bulletproof, flameproof, and beats Ursain Bolt in a sprint.This is why i&#39;d rather watch Peacemaker :D

Looks like a Colossus from Days Gone.

Graphics . Marvel reality, smooth, standard, ultra no hig graphics only 

Cool

We interrupt this episode of Legends of Tomorrow to bring you Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.

The amazing spider man came out 10 years ago...

Ooooookay.  We already have a green Hulk.  Now, this one is a regular human skin color and a lot skinnier.....(???).  They need something different - not our Hulk. It&#39;s kinda stupid - if you ask me.

Extremely stupid people are criticizing the CGI.

This is probably some of the worst CGI I’ve ever seen 

Клёвое ширево! Где можно купить такой шприц?

How nice of the monster guy to teleport a few meters back to the bombs could hit him and not our heroes!

Economist budget film

I don&#39;t know why they are making DC stuff like this.. Isnt warner bros one of the most richest companies in history?

If it were a Toy they would think it was the cheap copy of the hulk

So PG had to stop watching after it became a kids show.

This looks so bad it&#39;s embarrasing to look at. Like it&#39;s made for 8 year olds or something.

Low budget hulk 

Looks like a group of cossplayers playing on an angry old man&#39;s property and he goes apeshit on their asses like &quot;get off my lawn&quot;

Realy dc ? 

This is a shit

<a href="">1:48</a> this man has no idea how to operate a motorcycle.

<a href="">0:32</a> should have his body in that water. Poor VFX team.

The CGI here fucking sucks, I never thought a big company would create this shit.

I can’t believe that this is actually real

another hulk

Good day

Good luck

Every bodybuilding enthusiast be like Hhhhmmm interesting..

He&#39;s almost like the incredible Hulk but he&#39;s white instead of green.

Heck ive seen sweaty youtubers in their mums basement create their first animated/digital short movie without anu funding or budget that looked 10x better.This is like someone just slammed a green screen and said action



What kind of low budget, starter kit, Unspectacular Hulk is this?

Batter than captain America civil war

<a href="">

Looks like the total budget for this was about $10

It&#39;s the pink hulk

Thought this was a fan made

Baron Krieger?? Wade Eiling germani version ??

Cheap schitty version of the Hulk.

I&#39;d rather inject mirakuru in myself than whatever he injected

No way this aired on tv. No way.

Low budget hulk be like

NANO MACHINES SON

Schwachsinn in Vollendung.

I realize there’s bad mojo regarding the series/special affects but godDAMN he was so HOT when he ripped off his shirt.

Is this a fan made scene of actual TV series???

douche coin?

<a href="">

This is just like the slap 2 LOL

Tf is this? Did the actors rly agree to make this movie public with those special effects? You got no pride as good actors? Fk them money, they can&#39;t buy you respect from your fans..

Whats your power? I have a shotgun

Cómo se llama la película

With series the cg can&#39;t be blamed! Can get better but with time and budget into consideration just smalll corrections would have got it better! Never blame tho the work put into making this isn&#39;t easy after all

Man can you believe this is almost 5 years d this October-november I remember watching it when it first aired back in 2016

Horrible cgi

Looks like it was filmed in my backyard

Talk about low budget lol

I do not understand why people waste money on making such bad quality movies?

What in the Walmart Avengers is this?

️

Что за фильм?

Mr Olympia today is more then him

Copy of Hulk...

Their budget is like 200

OMG the special effects are shit, it looks like they used adobe after effects..

MASSON JEAN MARIE

I like the Captain Nazista my bad favorite.

I bet most of the people who watch this think he&#39;s on starioz

I can tell the haters that can they make something better than this?

whoever made this movie obviously has no idea how a motorcycle throttle actually works.....

Who else was thinking Red Hulk with a blond wig?

This some low budget bullshit lmao

It probably would have been cheaper to get The Mountain to do it.

Bxjsgdow=

When I saw this clip.. I thought it was a scene from a 2003 movie or sum

Mister Ryder?

Was this from the 80s?  The CGI is terrible!  Whenever I see scenes like this, I can&#39;t help but imagine how incredibly stupid the actors must feel while filming that...it&#39;s utterly ridiculous...

I used to watch this show and i stopped.

Man, this is beyond bad...

This looks like some fans spent $150 and made a movie.  OMG

LOW QUALITY VFX

D Grade movie the acting such as it is is terrible

Любопытно. А способны ли авторы подобного &quot;творчества&quot; к искусству.

Hopefully everyone will get fed up with films like this.....soon!

MISSING  <b>*</b>

People are showing too much <b>hate</b> towards it. I know it isn&#39;t the best looking CGI we have in tv. But you should understand that this show have a huge cast which work in different environments every episode. Also, it&#39;s not like it is the main villain. Just a very side character who came for an episode for a few mins.It is basically Hulk. But for tv....for a show with not so high budget.... With alot more CGI to do for many of characters.... For a few mins for an episode. By that standards. It&#39;s good.Also, i know it isn&#39;t a masterpiece but i like this show. It is mindless and stupid at times but it&#39;s something i can enjoy at least 

Pretty decent special effects. Did it come out in 97?

Что это за дешевка?)

All together, including the children, we pass to the Eternal Father !!!Indications for the treatment * <a href="">www.padreceleste.com</a> Dear brothers! I take this opportunity to offer you mutual and collective cooperation through prayer, let me explain it right away: together with some of you, I formed a prayer group called &quot;ReteTrinità&quot;, which consists of a community of universal brotherhood based on love of God the Father. Every evening after lunch or before going to bed, we hold prayers in each of the houses with other participants scattered around different parts of the world. The prayer takes place on the knees and with the union of the hands, starting moderately with Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; (Importantly ... we do not share our hands, because the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact.) The moment we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, delirium and much other . another. everything leaves the prayers, because even if we wanted to find something, it would be impossible to do, so we will start with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase &quot;Hello, God ..&quot;; Immediately, there is a message about the problems that concern us, asking for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church three main prayers, pater, ave and gloria (the simplest and best known by people) and offers them the opportunity to speak with God in the family, where you can talk about everything with the Almighty, from small everyday things to serious problems, in a word, true 360 degree dialogue. Between one joke and the other, and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat once Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; Therefore, praying together, the presence of God is present simultaneously in all hearts, and this facilitates His intervention. Having benefited, it was decided to repeat the morning and / or afternoon prayers. Obviously, if your daily duties do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can transfer it to another hour of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you are doing it. However, it is important that the evening prayer be performed without fail. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the method used so far and I assure you that dialogue with the Almighty frees the soul from pollution and brings peace and prosperity. I express my most sincere congratulations on my behalf and on behalf of the other brothers in the prayer group, hoping to be more numerous. a hug Altynai Isabaev I received this teaching of prayer in a social network from a girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to the family and to give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful to improve the soul! he sent it to make God known The sign of the cross, Our Father who is in heaven, holy is his name, your kingdom is coming, your will is being done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us our bread day by day, and forgive our sins as we forgive those who trespass and sin against us, and help us not to fall into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus.** Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen Glory be to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, as it is now and as it will be forever to come. Amen *

How is the CW still a thing? I honestly believe it&#39;s the worst representation of DC Comics ever! They dont have the budget to accurately portray even the C- Listers and they cast the worse actors( mostly talent less models). Its superheroes for your girlfriend who doesn&#39;t give a shit about them.

Cw: hey I got 20 bucks. Y’all wanna make a show? *how this came to be 

Wtf, is this fan fiction or something?

Pure, dripping cheese.

DC shows are shit

No comment

N rmmber kids.. stay away frm drugs

Just stop.

Isnt that shazam&#39;s enemy?

This is some low budget cringe...

Stretch Armstrong anyone? No? Ok.

Ugliest CGI ive ever seen

C grade movie

This show looks like shit looks like a bunch of idiots in suits fighting a really shitty enemy

Looks awful like a power rangers show the costumes and Cgi look worse that a cosplay

I mean damn they’re really giving power rangers a run for their money right now.

When you don’t know what’s more amazing the CGI or the acting. None the less it seems  like its an amazing show to watch 25 years ago.

Amazing 

LMFAO!!!!!!!!!
