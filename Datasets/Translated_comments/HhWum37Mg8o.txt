SUSHANT : Gem   of a Person. Extremely talented.  Highly Intellect.  Return if Possible SUSHANT.  The world  is missing you Sushant. BOLLYWOOD : Bollywood is definitely feeling insecure about talented people. Talented people in Bollywood are either under rated or forced to take an exit from Bollywood. What&#39;s wrong with Bollywood ??  Bollywood is comfortable with people who show off for nothing.Showing off cannot be called as talent in anyway.Showing off for nothing = &quot;TRASH&quot;. Bollywood needs to understand that. Talented people will rock and shine from any part of the world. That&#39;s for sure.BOLLYWOOD is CRAP. INDIA : WAKE UP PLS.Stop giving too much importance to Bollywood.Start recognising the talent.  Everyone feels that India does not recognise talent. Prove them wrong. It&#39;s high time India. India is definitely at crossroads in distinguishing between talent and trash. India needs to address  that. Hope my country understands that.In other countries &quot;TALENT&quot; speaks.In India &quot;MONEY&quot; speaks.This is the reality of INDIA.

We miss sushanth Singh rajput from South India

Masterpiece



The dream is to recreate this with mine...

It&#39;s almost the end of June 2023 but I&#39;m still in love with this film and the film&#39;s song

How beautifully both sung this song....Kudos to Shreya and Mohit ️

Sushant sing rajput ⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘sushant sing rajput 

He his a pure ….. he always alive in our hearts ️…. Missing  3 years…

Remember him as a Happy soul, a very beautiful kind one who has emmense love for life, his fans and everything. He always create love everywhere he goes. I am hurt till now how his murder was portrayed as suicide nd we were going to accept it, how ugly and terrible that would be if we will not see the truth behind this big lie.. The truth would be buried under carpet. This truth be known to world that Sushant was murdered... This beautiful boy deserve justice at any cost.... Rest In Peace STAR

14/6

<a href="">2:19</a> Two different lyrics by two different singers comes and meets at a word &#39;waada&#39; , in a single songI think this is one of a kind for any song I&#39;ve ever heard

Meine bhi aisi jagah dekhi hai

Sushant singh rajput is not only a name he is emotion 

Сушант Россия помнит и скорбит по тебе



Jab jab mujhe aasman me taare najar aata hai tab mujhe SSR aur yeh gaana yaad aata hai 

master pices here in lofi verson: 

This song is connected to my heart 

I am from Chennai i don&#39;t understand Hindi but when ever I hear this song it&#39;s makes me feel sad  ps: I know it&#39;s a romantic happy song but when ever I see sushant especially in this movie were he dies (both in movie and real life) i can&#39;t 

I cry every day I can&#39;t believe (We will never see Sushant again) I cry in tears over your death I wish to see you I wish to see you happy wherever you are - Nobody takes your place 

Why only 6 million people? I&#39;m really sad for what we are. We miss you, SSR

This makes me feel like I&#39;m with my crush on a date but ik this is not possible

SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT LOVE LOVE

His face at &quot;<a href="">1:20</a>  to <a href="">1:23</a>&quot; I wish time could stand still &amp; I could run fast as I could and hold him tight.God has been very unfairSSR no one can ever get over you.

I got to know that.. I&#39;m not strong enough in terms of accepting closed one&#39;s death... easily it&#39;s just.. unbearable for me to accept the reality... Still feeling personal &amp; deep loss... ( SSR )

Anyone here for shivani bafna di

Dedicated to ours adorable golden heart king sushant on this valentine day ...sushant dear 

I&#39;m soaring after seeing disarming charm of ssr can&#39;t envisage such a pure golden heart man deserted us  &quot; apko hamari kasam laut aaeeye &quot; sushant emmanuel raj kumar junior my soul This valentine week listening this song only for you sushant

SSR you will always be loved

Often miss him badly... And come to see him with the eyes of tears.... 

i am watching daily this song one time feel good ️

Shreya Ghoshal ️

Usne bin kch kahe, bataye achank chl dia, wo jiske jane se dunia ahe bhr bhr ke kehte h, kash kismat me phir se use pana hota, we really miss u  sushant...

Miss you Sushent sir. .

Listening this song and imagine myself with him under starry night between slow and cold wind... It&#39;s an amazing feeling 

Listening 2022

Love It 

They  get    for  saying that.

All  those girls who accused  Sushant  of  being a  skirt  chaser  belong to the underworld.  It&#39;s  true.

One of the best songs of AR

This guy here is the proof that good things don&#39;t always happen to good people, and people don&#39;t always pay for their bad deeds. He is dead, nearly forgotten, bullies are thriving. That is life. Unfair.



Miss you ssr ️️

So  nice 

Bachpan ka pyaar almost 45 crore views  but taare gin sirf 45 lakh 

Sorry Sushant we fail to give you justice R.I.P. Return If Possible....

Now I feel better 

Nice

3 days to go for the birthday.. Love you Sushant. You motivate me to be better everyday. 

Ssr

It&#39;s feels like Sushant was part of my life. I was watching him since I was in class 2nd and today I&#39;m 17. I didn&#39;t believe the news about his death. I don&#39;t feel it was suicide. I really wanted to meet him some day.I never liked anyone in bollywood accept Sushant and Siddharth Malhotra. But now whenever I miss Sushant I listen his songs and I pray for him. May god give him long life in his next birth. The country loves you Sushant....️

Is  she a good human being? 

I LOVE YOU

I have something which don&#39;t let me watching movies, it&#39;s the pain I have for loosing u sushant.... Time heals everything but I&#39;m not agree. It&#39;s not, still my heart is heavy, still that Garland on your photo give me heartache. I m missing u every moment of life, either I am listening music or whatever I m thinking about you. How I wish I can bring you back as same as u r. Wish there is a way to communicate to departure beloved. Still my heart is crying Silently... I miss u sushant. Those who are responsible for your death they r curse. More they r enjoying life more I curse them

Cant believe that he was died 

SSR 

&quot;Roko ise jitna maihsus ho itna&quot; it&#39;s heart touching lines.SSR will be always in our hearts ️️

Alok Chaturvedi 

The humming notes of shreya is a bliss

Whenever I Watched Dil Bechara I Will Watch From The Busstand Scene When Manny And Kizie Meet Again Because I Love The Movie From That Scene. The Movie Is Like A Dream The Violin Tunes , Sanjana Sanghi&#39;s Smile And Sushant Singh&#39;s Looks. What A Movie But The Climax Scene When The Manny , Kizie  And JP In The Church The Scene Makes Me Cry A lot.

Whenever I see him, feel immense heartache, still after one year of his passing away :(



This song make me cryI really love this song . This song is really lovely

<a href="">1:33</a> Sushant was So fortunate to work with AR Rahman&#39;s Legend Music and Mohit Chauahan voice is really heartmelting. Sushant is the one who fits this line if the song, i.e. &quot;Roko ise Jitna Mahsoos ho ye utna&quot;.

Susant was a great guy but not with us now 



Jab se Sushant dekhta h Acha sa Lagta h

Kaise ho aap Sushant Jald hi mulaqaat hogi better place pe jaha sirf sukoon hai ️️

Miss you susant

World is unpredictable, life goes one day, people come and go and world cry for departure people for month, year and so on and at the end they forget the departured person, becoming busy in life, but whenever I thought about u, tears are saying,, no your time was not come, you have. More life to live, u had dreams, planning, they forced u to departure, sushi, forgot the departure people is not perfect for your life, I am crying all alone, I feel the pain of loosing a precious life, and what this will happened with you also, like everyone forgets dead one, we also forget u, it makes me too sad man, fact is that I don&#39;t want to forget u ,your memories, life, lessons, everything I want to remember about u, that&#39;s it man, but dear your people are still want u back, why your mahadev not seeing how much your good karma make u a beautiful guy after u gone, everyone has teary eyes while talk about u, come back our idol, missing your presence......

After heard  some where played these song nd I come here to listen full song 

Superrrb Awesome Fantastic song

<a href="">

The day start again without u, with a heavy heart, fill with pain, teary eyes ,and pain in throat as I control on my emotions, trying to be happy, I am going to start this day, what u did for the people, generation it make me numb, now I don&#39;t have words to express this feeling, when someone did sacrifice for positive intentions and to do something good which can make the universe better then may be your sacrifice hurting everyone but endeed u get your reward, people respect u till the end for your greatness, this is what happened with u

What can I do for u mere bhai dil se lagaya hai tere ko aise kaise bhuljau
