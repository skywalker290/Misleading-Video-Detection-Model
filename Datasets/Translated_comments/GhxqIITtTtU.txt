It&#39;s over for humans, monke era begins!

Wtf😂😂😂

East slavs be like:

So this is Chuck&#39;s POV of Slippin&#39; Jimmy with a law degree

You guys know this footage is fake right lmao

Morons

Question : how many apes are there in this video ?

This is why Africa needs to stop it with all the wars it has. Rebellions, Revolutions, Civil Wars, Insurgencies, Partisans, Military Dictators, Coups. Now it&#39;s affecting the Continent&#39;s wildlife as it is towards civilians.

thats my cousin hes from Afghanistan.

<b>”Hold on Let me check if friendly fire is on”</b>Me: <a href="">0:24</a>

I dont see a difference

<b>”you guys are literally the reason shampoo has instructions on it.”</b>

A chimp with a machine gun is like Slippin Jimmy with a law degree

Monkey be like: why you ran bro it was a joke😂

Oh shi. ITS NOW ARABIC.

“where your gun?”“a monkey stole it”“what? one of the soldiers stole it?”“wait what”

Chicago getting ruff.

And this is how Palworld was born

&quot;friendly fire is not tolerated&quot;

This is TONY MONTANA ,he is reborn as a CHIMP 😅

African Plant Of Apes With Rtx on.

nobody:people that are here because of the challenge to win playlist

The rise of the planet of the apes!!! 🇺🇸

Whole scene is remarkably reminiscent of the way cutscenes in Far Cry games are presented.

<a href="">0:38</a> wolverines!

bro going to conquer the jungle

&quot;Friendly fire will not br tolorated&quot;

This reminds me of dawn of the planet of the apes when Koba starts to shoot the soldiers with guns.

Dude the victory pose at the end

Planet of the apes.

😂😂😂😂

It&#39;s clear who are the real monkeys

What part of Chicago is this?

Friendly fire

Lol

<a href="">

bravo vince!

Balls

Reminds me of the Ukrainians when they still had nuclear weapons.

This is so fake because the bolt carrier isn&#39;t even resprecating to extract the casing, so that just makes it automatically fake.

Palworld be like: <a href="">0:27</a>

&quot;It was at this moment that the monke became American&quot;

😂😂😂😂

Ooohh so this is what inspired Palworld

A Brazilian &quot;tourist&quot; gets handed a weapon by African paramilitary soldiers who did not know any better, circa 2009, colorized.

Ok

And this is how planet of the apes got started 😅

Is that the real life Koba (Dawn of the planet of the Apes)

Honestly cute, BUT those guys probably cut the poor thing&#39;s limbs of and tossed it away

Nah Bro Really Said, What&#39;s This Weird Shape Do?? Ohhh Yes Its An Ak-47 Loaded With 7.62x39mm Rounds Capable Of Firing 600 to 700 RPM Using A Steel, Wood And Polymer Body And I Am Fully Capable Of Handling The 6 - 7 KG Of Recoil Force Considering The Fact That I Am A Small Ape.. Yes.

How did all those monkeys get those guns?

This is a resolution😂😂😂
This is how the Planet of the Apes came to be!

Chimps could solve so many urban problems in America this way 😂

The sequel to Trunk Monkey we never knew we needed!

Tanzee from Palworld, colourized.

Fake

Baltimore City scene

This kinda gives me farcry 3 vibes

Planet apes

An Anunnaki situation when guns were handed to humans lol

The planet of the apes reboot advertising was strange, but definitely memorable

rise of the planet of the apes be like...

I'm glad I didn't know about reloading.
Monkey see monkey do

Me and the homies at 3am💀

Tannee in pal world be like:

Gotta love that arm raise in triumph at the end!

Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes be like:

Palworld RTX: On

all i see is 5 monkes playing together and getting into a fight for dominace

Tanzee from palworld be like

I still think about this video a lot

Soldier monkey1
Legand says he still has the AK

camera man is invincible

Hey look! Is Jimmy McGill after getting his law degree!

For some reason this is in the challenge to win Canon

What idiots who would give a chimp a gun and demonstrate what to do with said gun funny to watch though nobody screw with chimp chimp with gun You&#39;re screwed

Ape K - 47

Gorilla warfare

Is dis real or fake

I guess some juvenile chimps can be deaf , instead of dropping the gun snd fleeing at the loud noise the very young chimp continued to spray bullets , i hsd trouble counting the ejected shell casings but i am partially visuslly impaired

Humans: our relative primates can’t get that intelligent right?

It&#39;s like Slippin Jimmy with a law degree.

We can&#39;t tell who is an ape.

UTTP the second after SMG4 uploads something:

Damn… and I though “Planet of the Apes” was just a movie 😮

My guy tore down the African front.

<a href="">0:37</a> Victory Royale

Alright who turned on friendly fire

Russian soldiers:

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Now you remember😂😂😂😂

Classic monke rebel clip
CTW 21 looking fire 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who&#39;s the ape there? everyone looks similar there

Halo brutes 💀
From there on out, it was forever the Alpha male.

Chimpanzees are highly intelligent among monkeys, so this happens 😂
This man&#39;s and the monkey are in the same level..  the monkey has more brain than those man&#39;s

😂

APES MEETING 🤝
<a href="">0:24</a> Never gets any old

This is how it starts bro…

Koba from planet of the apes when he was young

Zero kill. Shame.
also a chimpanzee!

What is the movie

One of the best clips the net has ever produced😂😂

a monkey humping an ak has more range than he thought.

i like how the ape instinctively knows he&#39;s won

I know this is all fake, but still funny af.

Why the give the monkey the Yoppa?

The chimps name is Jimmy.

Just stupid people 🤷🏻‍♂️
This is how rise of apes originated

P.O.V. You’re scrolling through looking for a racist comment

i mean what were they thinking would happen

Watching this every year to see how old I get the good old times 🧓👵

This was the first youtube video I ever watched.

Legend says that a chimp with an AK is still wandering the jungle

Plural

planet of the apes realized.

Apes*

MONKBO

Animals always know who is their real enemy.

I can&#39;t believe this film predicted Saul Goodman 4 years before it was released.

I count 6 Apes

Ape gives gun to an ape.....what can go wrong ?

uh
Hes playing APEX

That’s just funny, lmao!

Coolest monkey in the jungle.

An APE-47

Sad thing is the probably shot him to get the gun back

Caesar reincarnated
What movie is this from? Its so fresh in my mind but i feel like its been copied by another movie idk which one tho. Seems like it would be in tropic thunder

That&#39;s an IMPRESSIVE looking CGI for 2009...

Is it real?

boy became king of the jungle that day

Even after ten years, I learn everyday from this clips

The monkey is smarter than them
Bro has friendly fire enabled 💀

They were mocking the ape at first but by giving him a gun, they really showed that they&#39;re dumber than him

Rise of the apes be like

You&#39;re slippin Jimmy!

new planet of the apes trailer looking crazy

5 apes with ak-47&#39;s

this human specie is serious

Ape :i am the king now BASTARDS

Damn, that monkey is smart

That ape is gangsta. Lol

Your average black neighborhood
Chat is this real

Pov: You give your 5 year old brother an ak-47

Harambe wouldn’t approve of this ape disturbing the peace fyi harambe is the gorilla who saved a child and got shot by a zookeeper with a gun reply respect to pay respects to him

u missed bro

Never has that monkey felt this much power

What a savage

with would be a good trailer for farcry 3 lol

This is Jimmy in the eyes of Chuck McGill

All the characters are &quot;monkeys.&quot;

guys is fake i know, is fake why do you guys think is real, stoopib, you stoopib

witch one is the ape

This is James M. McGill with a law degree

What do you think, country of monkey is bigger than before?

It&#39;s a fake CGI video guys

You know looking back on this it’s comforting to know that Americans aren’t the only ones doing dumb shit out here lmao. Maybe Floridians or Alabamians would.

No one was harmed in the making of this video

look it&#39;s slippin Jimmy with a law degree

who let saul have a law degree?

Peruvian
This is my spirit animal.

Ethiopia is that you ?! 😂😂

The planet of the APES

The monkey must have seen other&#39;s shoot an AK47 ..

That&#39;s how terrorist was born after the evolution

Ape-k-47

This would be a perfect scene for planet of the apes

The funny thing is that I just found this in the challenge to win objective show playlist

Chicago

why did u give it to him 😅

🤔Oakland?
pvp sent me

Ohohoho so this is the fabled “super saiyan”

Caesar
“Don’t shoot those are our guys!” - 🐒

That CIA skag is pretty powerful stuff.

oh great,  he&#39;s at least twice as strong as any one of them, and some wants to give him a gun.

Well, that’s what happens when you literally hand over a deadly weapon to a pair of inexperienced hands. He or she is in a worse position than even a child. A child could at least have it explained to them that a gun is dangerous and never to be played with lightly. That ape would not be able to understand. He or she likely has no idea what they’re doing or how they could hurt the men.I’d say it’s one hundred percent their fault.

You’re slipping jimmy! and slipping jimmy I can handle just fine but slipping jimmy with a law degree is like-

Hehe, it&#39;s Furious George
Nina hartley nude hairy

And to think this was movie promo for Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Whose the real ape there …..

They are all apes though

Bro the ape became a terrorist

Ape Strong Together

THAT’S LIKE SLIPPEN JIMMY WITH A LAW DEGREE!!!
If it wasn t recorded nobody would have believed that the monkey shot at them

Ape together strong

They gave the Ukrainians a rifle. What did they expect?
Hell nah

Monkey smart as hell

Not to be racist but those guys were the real monkeys to do something so stupid.

Monkey Strike

I told you dre, you should&#39;ve kept that thing put away.I guess that&#39;ll teach you not to let me play with it, ey?

&quot;Who needs courage when you have a gun?&quot;- Professor Farnsworth

Terrorist vs counter-terrorist
I just see James McGill wtf

Planet of the apes irl

It&#39;s time to conquer the world bro.Go for it

Back when cgi and movies were daring lol

Title: &quot;Ape with AK-47&quot;Contents: Four black guys with weapons.That can&#39;t have been a coincidence.

😂😂😂😂😂 omg  id give anything to hang out  with those dudes for few days 😂😂😂too much shiting myself

which one is the monkey? they are all the same!

This is a textbook example of, “Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.”

Which monkey you talking about?

Bro got the simian flu ☠️

Why isn’t it plural

Average palestine resident at the age of 5:

Good for the chimpanzee.
“The day the founder of Hamas knew his destiny “

Holds his rifle high! VICTORY!

What the actual.. in the world… for the love of… have I actually seen?

Monkeys with guns are black men)))

This is how Chuck thought Jimmy was

planets of aps : war of africa ,,, &#39;&#39;THE FIGHT HAS BEGIN &#39;&#39; . 😅😅

This is my favorite Challenge To Win episode

hes using gorilla tactics

Commander 0&#39;s also need to go, removed, erased, deleted, from SimCity. As all must be mentally relaxed, physically relaxed, with common sense.

Not just one ape but multiple I am looking at

<a href="">0:37</a> DON’T FUCK WITH MONKE

People underestimate just how smart monkeys are. We did evolve from them, after all.

DANG HE WANTS HIS BANANAS

&quot;Slippin&#39; Jimmy with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun!&quot;- Charles McGill

I watch this every six months whether I need a laugh or not

umm it isnt really ok to call them that but good vid

Planet of the apes is a reality now

The seeded blood type 0&#39;s of Africa have an embedded gangster fearless mentality mindset most likely from their original animal primate form being. There however, seems to be more mentally and physically relaxed blood type 0&#39;s non-African, that seem more mentally relaxed, more physically relaxed. The likes of Bumblebee Blood Type 0&#39;s, possibly also the Latin American blood type 0&#39;s. This is aside from them getting a Zionist or 666 Decepticon infection. As they all turn fearl after such Zionist or 666 Decepticon infection/virus.

The way he received the gun : assault weapon aquired

Legends say that he is out there fighting for the Apes

&quot;eastern dictators&quot; perfect specimen.Loyal, and willing to destroy what is being told.It&#39;s not fun. AT ALL.

This was really well made

...the amount of dent heads in the comments who think is is real proves a staggering decline in intelligence, just in the last 12 years.

This is how the planet of the apes starts in real world

I have no idea wtf i have just watched but this is real life planet of the apes shit.

Back then people thought this was real 🤣🤣🤣 how gullible people are such stupidity 😆😆😆

planet of the apes

Reported. This is some really disgusting behaviors by humans. You NEVER mock an animal.

My boy is a big black monkey with an a k forty seven

That’s what they should’ve expected teaching a monkey to aim and shoot at people 😂

THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF PLANET OF THE APES!!!  LOLOL
You know this is fake because the cameraman didn&#39;t run away

The name should be &quot;monke with machinegun&quot;

Nigeria

Singles there 😂😂😂
Which one?

It’s all fun and games till the chimp has a gun

emote on end
Why does this monke have a Ak-47 ☠️

This footage never gets old.

Fear of a chimp planet

Long before time had a name, Ninjago was created by the First Spinjitzu Master, using the Four Weapons of Spinjitzu. The Scythe of Quakes, the Nunchucks of Lightning, the Shurikens of Ice and the Sword of Fire. Weapons so powerful, no one can handle all of their power at once! When he passed away, his two sons swore to protect them, but the oldest was consumed by darkness and wanted to possess them. A battle between brothers broke out, and the oldest was struck down and banished to the Underworld. Peace returned, and the younger brother hid the weapons, but knowing his older brother&#39;s relentless ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them. And for fear of his own demise, a map for an honest man to hide. That honest man was your father. The older brother is Lord Garmadon, and I... need to find those weapons before he does

He Said &quot;I Am The Chosen One&quot;

Where is the ape in this video??

Average ape in West Africa

Literal brass monkey

What

Reminds me of planet apes

They do the very same thing in Feruson,,Mo, Atlanta, Detroit, LA, and many other cities in the US.  The wisest thing to do is to keep guns out of the hands of primates.

Monkey Around &amp; Find Out!

&quot;Slippin jimmy I can handle just fine, but Slippin with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun&quot;

mokey
Planet of apes has been in the making!!!! Expect this one will probably be labeled &quot;Payback is a CHIMP!!!&quot;, or &quot;The New Poachers of Doom!!!&quot;

A primate learned how to use a gun. That&#39;ll be a new one for gun control to hear about.

Fake

Nah the monkey is keeping the gun now

It&#39;s still funny because no one was injured or.. killed.

I like how the monkey celebrated by raising the gun 😂

"Start respecting my Mexico more, please"
Real monkeys world

monke: &quot;so anyway i started blastin&#39;&quot;

This video is about Russians picking up guns and going out to kill

Why are they teasing their family member

The monkey is still more responsible with a gun than the average Right wing Republican gun owner.

Everyone will leave, but not the camera man😂

This is the equivalent of Biden being President.

So it’s a metaphor for Trump

The planet of the apes

My bibinii de3
That&#39;s not a chimp. That&#39;s a midget dwarf wearing a hairy monkey suit that needs acting work badly.

YOU ARE ALL FOOLS.....!!!! Typical Millenials... This is a Clip of &#39;Planet of the apes&#39;...!!!  And YOU ALL MOTHERFU****S believe this shi#...!! 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕

I saw like 6…
It&#39;s pretty bad when you are dumber than a monkey.

How did the not see that coming?

There are smart monkeys, and there are stupid monkeys...

Looks like Detroit

Monkey is comrade

At least he killed them.
Hé is more sensible than the asses around him.

Leave it to black people.

The time has come! Somebody call Joe Rogan!

Well, the chimp has more brains than anyone else who carries one of those guns.

Like moth to a flame

Not so fun when the monkey got the gun 👀

Planet of the Apes cancelled prequel

😂😂😂

&quot;&quot;&quot;From this video we Learn that we shouldn&#39;t go that jungle without vest beacuse legend says that he is waiting with his gun still now&quot;&quot;&quot;

It&#39;s all fun, games and mockery until the monkey is armed...Then play time is OVER 🐒🐒🐒

Bro got his victory 💀

i see a bunch of apes with guns

Which one?

Looks like every Repube out there with a commercial with a gun

Camera man had invisible portion, hence proved

“ it’s so easy a child could use it” “maybe a monkey too”

Gangsta&#39;s paradise

How nice of the ape, to share his loud stick toy with the curious little furry creature

Fake fake fake fake fake. I can point out half a million things wrong here. But I&#39;ll just go with 2...Number 1: there&#39;s no recoil on the AK 47, everyone who knows a little about firearms know that an AK kicks like a mule.Number 2: the sound that the weapon made, it&#39;s a dead give away.

Real rise of the planet apes

That&#39;s was so hilarious 😂

That to see Saul still practicing law

Is this real

All monkeys!
Teacher : what comes before 47.Gorrila : AK 😂

If the makaken had fired from the Kalash, we would not have seen him again.
Realistic gun sound 😂

Not real but still funny

The title ist wrong, mußt bei apes with AK47.So stupid giving him a gun.

That&#39;s funny. There&#39;s really not much difference between the monkey and the people that live there. They are basically the same.

Cameraman never dies 🤣🤣🤣
Ape deserves Oscar 😅Khatarnak 🔥🔥
Hahaha looks like an @f®¡©@|\| American holding an ak 47 out in the hood demanding 🍉 and chicken wings hahaha 🤭😂

Intelligence was clearly not a requirement in that army..., the ape learned them a lesson.... What is even more surprising to me is that he fired 2 rounds in the ground... as if he knew how deadly this could be..., if this video id real, that is...

Mahnke turned out to be smarter
What were they expecting?
i’m da captain now
APES. TOGETHER. STRONG.

The ape was like, why are you running 😆

Monkeys with machine guns😂

Far cry enemies at their own free time. Playing with monkeys , man and i thought far cry 3 had no monkeys.

Spare a thought for those who think this is real

mokes playin with guns. dangerous stuff

Monkeys are so intelligent!!! 1: Was friendly to a different species even though they could fight.2: Shot at the ground below everyone as they know the bullet trajectory.3: Kept the entire encounter as a joke and never proceeded to kill anyone.4: Mimic local soldier victory movement.WOW!!! 😂😂

You mean apes

Monkey with monkeys

This may be the real world sezar

It&#39;s unbelievable, did this really happen or is it a scene from a movie, but if it&#39;s real, they can do very dangerous things and they are very smart. 😯😧☺️😉

He mocks monkey with finger in his nose ...... Monkey mocks them with bullets in their backs

Bro these guys look exactly like Call of Duty/Far Cry enemies

Green screen dummies.

Caesar&#39;s long lost brother.
wtf is this it looks so bad lol

Just the cameraman&#39;s voice

Charles Darwin&#39;s successor of his theory of evolution.

Can someone confirm if is a real shooting, not added sound, and effects of bullets?

Zelenski fighting Russians...😂
Then raised the gun on em….he knew exactly wtf he was doin 😂😂💀💀

If only this video was real lol.

How nature says do not touch;1) A snake with a rattle on its tail.2) A brightly coloured frog.3) A pointy fin on the back of a shark.4) A monkey with an AK-47.

LMFAO

the way he raised the gun over his head tho

Rise of the Planet of the Apes is slowly becoming non-fiction

Good. Bad. I’m the one with the gun.

His name is Cesar…!!!

i would have unlo9aded it

I heard later that day he held up a grocery store and left with a grocery cart full of bananas!

Life could be a dream

Planet of the apes was a documentary. Philly, Baltimore, Chicago, st Louis, etc, etc...all gone.

This is the moment James Morgan McGill became a chimp with a machine gun

What a stupid video.....

George got too curious....

Brazy

Monkey says “when we goin to da hood bro”??

Planet of the Apes
And a chimp

Chicago?

And that’s how Caesar learned how to use a gun

Good spray pattern, form and controlled the recoil. Give em marksman badge asap

Why does that unsurpressed AK sound like that? 😂

and who is the monkey?
Bro turned from funny cameo to main character in 40 seconds.

Africans (bantu / n e e g ro, a once tiny race which originated from Nigeria 2,000 years ago), colonised the entire sub Saharan Africa, wiping out ALL the indigenous tribes and races like the Hadza, Sandawe, Pygmy, San etc. This is proven beyond doubt by linguistics and DNA. Blacks are now busy colonising and replacing populations in the West! Wake up.

This is how they create more Republicans in America!

Which one?

I see 5 apes instead of 1

There wasn&#39;t only one ape with a gun

There now is a new king of the jungle.

That chimp has better trigger discipline than some people I know...

All fun and games 😊🔥

Victory is Mine!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❣
ouh ouh
Later that day he fucked some others apes bitches

Monkey was like &quot;FUCK YES&quot;

The chimp has more of a right to hold an automatic weapon than them.

LOL! I still dont think they learned their lesson!😂

He&#39;s the new head of the NRA.

bloons tower defense update looking fire
A chimp I can handle just fine. But a Chimp with a machine gun is like Slippn’ Jimmy with a law degree!

Ummmm. How can I make this a non racial joke?🤔🤔Not sure it can be done in 2023 but I’ll try. I call any idiot with a gun an ape. Lemme go back. I call idiots apes. Monkeys, baboons etc etc… So I’ll now try be politically correct and ruin what would have been a funny joke or at least anecdotally. “Which one is the ape” Leave me alone Dumar…

Real life Koba!

That ape is really the king of the jungle 💀

Love how people think this is real. Must not be american if they think that is what a gun being fired that close sounds like.

Is this real?

Caesar is home
😂😂😂😂😂😂

And that&#39;s how planet of the apes started

Most realistic part of this video  is the gunshot samples

Not to be an a**hole…but some of these comments actually think this is real 😂

Yeah when he raised that weapon both hands , a childhood memory just resurfaced , I like that movie.

These monkeys are as stupid as we all know.......oh, I don&#39;t mean the one chimp.

Rambo its coming 🤣🤣🤣
I love how he raised the AK above his head as he won. The future is now old men, return to monke...

Once again they showed that man is not homo sapiens... Alas...
The other fun one was to give a chimp a grenade then put them in a conex container and take bets on how long until they figured it out.

The beginning made me think the title of the video was a very racist joke.

And that kids, is how the Planet of the Apes started

🤣🤣🤣 Fucking niggas 🤣🤣🤣
<b>WHO IS IMITATING WHO?</b>
Suspicious George
Lol

I’d arm every last one of them in America and tell them take what the racist took from you.

They were just training a new recruit into their A pe army.

Monkey see monkey doo.😂😂😂😂

So this was the motive for that movie scene

Planet of the Apes

This ape is the next Caesar

Ape surrendered when he saw a cameraman

Why the whole video looks like it&#39;s taken from a Far Cry 3 pirates outpost?

The gun shots sound totally 90s movie era but it&#39;s a well done I think some people in this chat actually believe it&#39;s real.

Pirates of Vaas?? So rook island is real .

Rise of the planet of the apes

The monkey gave the monkey a weapon 😮
Why tf would you give a chimp a loaded gun. They can easily pull a trigger ffs.

LOL, this is great!

Russians and their nuclear weapon:

Similar IQ

Ehh, you never teach a monkey... What kind of idiot do you have to be to give an animal a gun...
Behold, THE Ape-K- 47

Well, in the west, we call that a family fight

What could go wrong 🤔

Now we know this where the Ape revolution began...😂

Planet of the Apes will come true soon

YouTube knows what I need
It&#39;s not real, yeah? I mean - soldiers would instantly kill the ape in case of that, right?

Guerilla warfare is a little different in Africa

How did they know what Chicago in 2023 would be like?!?!

Hahahaha… idiot!
Giving the nuclear codes to an A.I. is like giving a machine gun to a monkey.

Planet of the apes in live action 😭💀

BECAUSE MEN LIVE LESS:

THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN

&quot;What&#39;s the worst that can happen?&quot;

«I wonder why women live longer than men.»Men:

What’s more stupid than giving an ape a gun?

damn the sound of a Kalash is even quieter than with a silencer
now imagine a whole planet of these apes, it would be total war with the rise of these apes and it will be the dawn of humanity

It's not very funny if you consider that it happens in reality.
braindead human beings... THIS IS FROM THE MOVIE PLANET OF THE APES.  dumb af

Like a boss

I can't believe my eyes that this happened. Damn, this is from a movie. And it looks very realistic
This is Jimmy McGill

Which one&#39;s the ape?

Why does this looks like a videogame

Oldie but goodie. I always wondered if it was fake.

But the monkey was pointing the machine gun and shooting without actually being trained, but imagine what would happen if monkeys were taught to use weapons
2023 ???????

pmc wagner

Since all humans are biologically classified as Hominidae which are great apes as well, I guess this title needs a change. There are apes who jump around and give one smaller ape a gun.

This is not funny people, black on black crime needs to stop.

This has to be staged. There&#39;s no way a person is stupid enough to give a chimp a loaded weapon while everything is recorded so smoothly.Edit: Whatever, I want it to be real haha

That&#39;s how Ceaser ancestors were Born.

&quot;Giving women rights is like giving a gun to a monkey&quot; so this is what he meant.

African pirates with machine guns. So? Am I missing something?

ROTFFLMFAO!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I see monkeys with guns all the time in Baltimore City

A laugh of a lifetime

If planet of the Apes would happen.....or just a bloopers.

Wonder at the level of stupidity the soldiers committed amidst fun.😱

Looks like Texas!
