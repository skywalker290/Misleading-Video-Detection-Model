Rajkumar Rao is the best main lead actor of the current crop but he&#39;s picking some really bad scripts off late.

Being a physical education teacher. I feel proud ️

best actor rajkumar raowho agrees

Bunty toh chutiya hai

The way she said sab bakwas, full farzi ho tum 

Brother I want to be a comedian but no one supports me  I have 1 request that you must watch the video of this niche after logging in or subscribe to the channel ️️<a href=""> href=" ">#skgvines</a>

&quot;You both have come again brother&quot;
Every time when I looking Rajkumar Rao and hearing his voice.. feeling about Homelander

After Rajkumar&#39;s dialogue bunty be like : Bunty to chutiya  h 

Fantastic
Who noticed bunty of sacred games

Instead of watching love jihadi movie laxmi I would prefer to watch chalang And bycott Canadian forever

** raj Kumar is superb ****️

Everything is good but your dubbing should not be done by the boys' band of yours and Arjun Kapoor's.
Bunty bhaiya zindabad ️


Rajkumar Rao delivered a great movie Shaadi mein Zaroor Ana in November 2017. 3 years later, again in November, he is returning with a sweet Romantic Comedy. All the best Chhalaang

They could have hired a better actress opposite Rajkumar rao....Nushrratt Bharuccha&#39;s acting skills are so boringly flat
