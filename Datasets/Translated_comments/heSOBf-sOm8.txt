Smart people run to middle of street,in the u.s. people would be dumbfounded and continue staring at their phones.

Why the hell youtube recommends me all disasters from the past especially earth quake

This day is the worst day for us

Every earthquake there is no chance that someone wouldn&#39;t run

These video is good for training.

Lived in fear for a whole year after this happened to us

when this earthquake occured i stay in 20th floor on our building. 

Kind of funny how everyone just runs like hell like a chicken without a head.

A normal Saturday turn into most hatest day

Scared
Hell no im not standing below the power lines , straight up get cooked.

I didn&#39;t search for this

It&#39;s amazing that statue wasn&#39;t destroyed...

0.48 Pubg waiting area...

Who is Here watching In 2020

Karma they mistreat the elephants
These guys have proper knowledge what to do at time of earthquake, move towards open space and join hands together

This video again made me remember that terrible day. Thank god it was Saturday holiday otherwise in school i could not judge what to do. If it was not a holiday the earthquake could do more disaster. I was is santinagar. There are no footage of santinagar, there a van was coming and the santinagar gate directly fell over that van and all the people inside that van died on the spot and i was  there only.

Damn Crazy

Something how they all knew to get out of buildings into the <a href="">street.in</a> case buildings colapse

Ngrunyu ngrunyu
the cracks on the ground at <a href="">2:59</a>

History will repeat itself 2020 ????????

God save us now onwards

Nepal is so clean

By the millions (people)  dont know what a real Earthquake feels like..I was out of the Country u.s.a  in el SALVADOR when a 7.6 earthquake hit..back in 2001 lucky 4 us we (Family) were having breakfast in the middle of the yard surrounded by tall fruit trees, so all of us just stood up holding each other ,n the way dose trees suave back n forth was like wow..now imagine being in the city?

amazing. The people of Nepal are wonderful in helping each other. People are protecting each other in the middle of the road.
Nepal is love butwal



How big was this earthquake

<a href="">1:52</a>, nothing happened to the statue,im astonished

Why are all the earthquake related videos comming up the recommendation. Is earthquake the new disaster of April? 

Within a second several lives were gone.

This was also my first experience of earthquake in Lucknow India, 350 km West  of Nepal.For 1st 20 seconds didn&#39;t knew f**k what was happening, my bed shaking i thought i was making it shake. Then realised grabbed the pillow and went to road. After that for atleast 3-4 months i would wake in middle of sleep imagining that i am vibrating and half awaken would run out in open.

<a href="">1:48</a> Lucky car in the right corner

Wow amazing u deserve it....
.<a href="">#zZz</a>#.Ô∏èÔ∏è

Is it the same place, just in different angles?

Death hurts everyone.
There are some lovely couples

<a href="">0:15</a> omg, this looks dangerous. Why there&#39;s no stoplight?

In God's Nepal, people protect themselves by taking to the streets in a planned manner and holding on to each other. In our country, wives forget their children at home and run away.
Sumanallah
This is power of GoD...

Doomsday rehearsal
I love it when people run together during a quake

O Allah good hair
Really scary especially since brick wall fly way far from the building, no such safe place in the middle of the street

I was in nepal in 2017 after this earthquake,,,,,the whole city is in slanting position i could not find a single house in straight  balanced position,,,,,,

Its been four years but it still feels like it happened yesterday :(

Gave me goosebumbps and she&#39;d tears for the humanity this people showed in times of disaster.

Good idea to get out in the open so there&#39;s less chance of something falling on you.  Looks like that&#39;s what people are instructed to do.

 the BIG ONE Philippines earthquake!

News  reports  have  trickled  down  to  say  that  on  24  April  ,  2019  ,   North  Eastern  States  of  Assam  and  Arunachal  Pradesh  in  India  and  Kathmandu  in  Nepal  were  jolted  by  strong  earthquakes.  While  Kathmandu   and  some  other  regions  of  Nepal  are  reported  to  have  been  jolted  by  three  strong  earthquakes  of  5.2  magnitude  or  somewhat  below  ,  Arunachal-Assam  had  6.1  magnitude  jolts.  The  residents  in  the  areas  visited  by  these  quakes  are  reported  to  have  come  out  of  their  houses  but  no  report  of  casualty  has  come.   Some  parts  of  U.P.  in  India  were  also  visited  by  quake  jolts.   Some  areas  of  Tibet  close  to  India   were  also  jolted. In  this  regard  ,  it  is  apt  to  mention  here  this  Vedic  astrology  writer‚Äôs  alert  for  more  care  and  appropriate  strategy  brought  to  public  domain  in  March  and  subsequently  on  5  April  ,  2019  through  article  -  ‚Äú  World  Trends  During  April  to  August  2019‚Äù .    The  predictive  alert  had  said  that    China  ,  India  and  Nepal  may  also  take  more  care  and  appropriate   strategy  against  likely  earthquakes  during  a  period  of  four  and  a  half  months  from  mid  -April  to  August  ,  more  so  in  June  ,    in  present  year  2019.

Just think, my Muslim brothers, how much fear a single jatka of Allah creates in the heart. I was very scared after watching this video. Allah is very great. Allahu Akbar is the greatest.
Get back to Allah before it&#39;s too late

uau...

Hmm, crash my motorbike and run...

<a href="">1:48</a> , were there cows in the middle of that roundabout escaping the collapsing monument ?

Nothing much, just moving the camera.
i remember this. i was in school when it happened, i don&#39;t exactly remember what happened because i was young but my class and i were going to music class and just before we stepped through the doors, the earthquake started. we had to return to the outdoor lobby and stay there until it had stopped. most people were crying and we were eventually picked up by our parents.

Nepal Jesus Christ loves u all.... get him...
Great peopleRespect from egypt

really sad....

Nepal what did thes time  everyone know? 10 thaugen + Cowe kill him.

j kara ni jaso kara ne chalcha nepal ma
Good to see most standing in the middle of the road. Safer place to stand.

This shows me all ppl will b United wen a problem occus to everyone like earthquake or tsunami etc...if problem  occur to one individual no one cares abt it...

I‚Äôm only here because we had to watch this in class and I started crying

Nepal is very beautiful country and good people too..salam from malaysia..

I was in the physics lab of my college at that time in Assam, India. I had to hold the table for that tremendous quake.

So they ran in the middle of the road to get away from the building? Hmmm  I see . Very good idea

Im glad I live in Arizona. No tornados, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or rain.
<a href="">0:17</a> you can see the earth slightly move before the big shock hits

Y does ths hpn most of the time n Nepal nly

Nepal is where my grandfather and grandmother lives

black day for Nepal

this is so wholesome the way they all huddle up like penguins

This is good. I hate Nepalese

all the 4 or 5 or multistorey buildings scare me when i see earthquakes.

What happened with Nepali people?
Even God is nothing compared to nature
i am also from nepal i was too scared !!!

Very danger earth quake

when earthquake formed man together without ego.....

Really amazing how those peolple stand together united like they already are preparednice people wonderful people

As Nepal is my motherland I feel really sad for those wha lose their family members

praying

My brother  was died in that

Mother nature!

So, all those people are running.... where do you run to in a Quake?

RIP to everyone who lost the lives!

I was in the toilet at the time of Prithvi Kouk. Suddenly everything got ruined. My potty stopped. I would part without washing it off. But I was full of poop. Tyler coming out of the toilet on the street. All the people taking my picture.
I am an indian but I live thereIt was sunday morning I was enjoying it by spending my time with my family. Than suddenly I experienced a earthquake I knew it was a earthquake but I didnt knew what to do. Than my mom grabbed my hand and we all went to the ground in front of our house. I saw all my neighbours gathering there and we all sat there together in large number. I saw many people serving tea and foods to us. By seeing nepalis unity I got amazed! They helped everyone there. I got happy. We should learn something from  nepals unity in tough times. They help each other in tough times!

The first clip was a smart act by the Nepali people

i love how caring people are holding on to eachother

wow what a disaster

Dude that is one gnarly experience.

For me even seing the first clip was so new, and usefull!

So mush mash

Very nice!

The world was turning sideways

every one is safe god gift

It&#39;s terrible

very bad
It reminds me of how helpless we &#39;little beings&#39; really are and how powerful God really is.... He cud destroy the universe in a second amd there&#39;s absolutely NOTHING we would be able to do.... Never let a moment go by without forgiving your brothers/sisters aswell as asking God for his forgiveness which is in Jesus Christ the Son... For we never know wen our last will be on d earth  God bless... Be strong  always. LOVE 

I have resist 8.2 earthquake in pakistan

I swear to God, an earthquake happened, but thank God nothing happened. I have a cold and I felt the shaking, but I thought it was imagination. If you see my brothers, their clothes are soaked in tears.
mother nature is the biggest SADIST

For solution visit <a href="">www.earthquaketechnology.com</a>
got goosebumps

Thankgos all nepali safe...
Their reaction is actually really impressive. They just ran into the middle of the street immediately, didn&#39;t panic, just stayed where it&#39;s safest.

God bless

Www,

I don&#39;t know how many happy Birthday  I&#39;ve ever been but he is a safe journey home  and my daughter and daughter who is the daughter of a very beautiful woman of the world  said the woman who had the same dream about the new she was also the husband the son and namesake of a husband who had been a son of the son of god who is the only one kl of a family who is also the son and the son for the best son husband

POOR NEPAL! I AM FROM NEPAL :(

Dont wait till its to late for you, because Jesus Christ loves you very much repent of your sins and ask Jesus to come into your heart and save you! the bible says in romans chapter 10 vers 8-13 says if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God and it is by confessing with your mouth that YOU ARE SAVED

Amazing
I Think this Was from ksi disstrack

CHAOS IS STARTING
Why do they clump up like that?

God bless them but I would have been scream in the whole time because it is very rare to have an earthquake in Los Angles. Like the last one I had was in 2013. And it wasn&#39;t big but the earth did a full turn. And I do know how strong earthquakes are in Cali.

Me: Look at that big crack at One For- oh my phone is just broken

Is that guy in the bottom middle, brown jacket,  at @<a href="">0:40</a> trying to appease the earthquake gods?

A deadly silence was descended on Nepal. No more news deriving from here!! It seems that all of the world isn&#39;t more interested in the lot of this nation.... Very very bad.

If you would be there then u will also hold hands of each other Rafi 

hii can i use this video

mother natur:marry fucking christmas

very sad.

Nature

I don&#39;t like it I feel bad for them

check out the unity among people when shit goes wrong.. maybe things like these should happen once in a while for people to get united

4 time experience of eathquake .....its very dangerous I dont know when will it come again here in mizoram

wauw so cool to see it! it looks like the are all trained to go in the middle ofthe street, my mom once told me to do that lol :)

I&#39;m so great full I was evacuated hour after the earthquake on a military plane

Earthquake in Nepal is a serious and dangerous for the people of the Nepal that indicates the life is not a safe any moment.

we reached on mars but we cannot predict 8km inside the damn  earth...how pity..

._.

Yeah... just stand in a doorway or hide under a table... right...

Don&#39;t come &#39;a knockin&#39; if Nepal is &#39;a rockin&#39;

Notice that there is not a single fat person in any of these videos?

This brings back memories of Christchurch 2011.

<a href="">0:25</a> is like: everybody get in line to win a free candy!

Horrible

you have no shame, dear, it's still 2015
omg
The title is &quot;Earthquake in Nepal.&quot; It could have been Bargain day on black Friday.

What is the purpose of this video? A voice over may have been helpful.

<a href="">3:00</a> HARCORE PARKOUR AT THE MOTORCYCLE

This is real

These people are clever 

Couldn&#39;t the street cave in?

I&#39;m grateful we weren&#39;t impacted like this by the recent Oklahoma earthquake also felt in Texas.

SOON in Oclahoma

Nepal is crazy

Wow thats amazing everyone just go out and helps  eatchothere to stand upp just if people always could be that helpfull and work togetehere that well

How the hell did those shit box buildings stay up!!

Makes you think, will these people believe? Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 99 Surah Zilzaal verse 1-3: When the earth is shaken with her utmost shaking, and the earth casts out all the burden from within her, and man says, What has befallen her?. Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 22 Surah Hajj verse 1-2: O mankind, save yourseves from the Wrath of your Lord. The fact is that the earthquake of the Resurrection is a terrible thing. The Day you behold it, you will see that every suckling woman will forsake her suckling; and every pregnant female will cast her burden; and the people will appear to you in a drunken state, though they will not be drunk! But the torment of Allah will be so dreadful. The earthquakes that we experience in this world today are just a pre-runner to the earthquake of the end of time. The earthquakes are one of the signs of Allah and their coming are absolutely in Allahs control. Even with all the technology available in the world today, the geologists are not able to point out where and when is the next earthquake going to strike! Allah Alone knows where and when his adhaab is going to come.

<a href="">2:41</a>-<a href="">4:41</a> checkout the driveway before and after a lot more cracked

ya can tell that their use to earthquakes

They were very calm which is good and they new what to do

Wow

it was really scary

<a href="">2:57</a> at the bottom left corner.. Cracks opened.

My respect to this people.

ALLAH is the greatest

Micheal bay?
Their traffic is crazy

Good  people and calmest one they didn&#39;t run they stopped and huddle!

Looked scary 

Smart people getting out their homes leaving the previous stuff for their lives many people wouldn&#39;t do the same they would get first the iPhone.... Then their iPads then they get out -.-

i thought i have broke my speakers and headphones

The first one, they are very clever! They hold themselves together and prevent falling

May God protect the brother of Muslims and protect Yemen
wow they know what to do when earthquake comes

Don&#39;t they have any traffic rules or something wtf

Oh, so when an earth quake happens, you&#39;re supposed to jump in the middle of the road? Cuz those people in the front of the second clip seem to know immediately when they stop like &quot;yep, this is an earthquake&quot; to get away from the buildings. Guess that makes sense, though. I&#39;ll remember that

why do they all go together?

Wow their reactions were on point, well done Nepal.    I loved how you could tell how hard the earth was swaying because the groups of people were swaying as one with it.

The reaction of the people is impressive. Wow !!

Im so happy for this culture, look at them, they dont care who are they with, it&#39;s all when they get in to this and stay together to hold against this disaster, You rock Nepal

Strong earthquake

bra

I live in the UK, where there are no earthquakes, so I don&#39;t understand - why does everyone rush to the middle of the road when they feel it start?

and we think ourselves so great and powerful because we have figured out a few things.... we are ants

I&#39;m SO glad Iive in Australia.  becauses we rarely get any natural disasters. but sadly, other countries aren&#39;t so safe:(

allah is a great

God is great
1.49 CRACK ON RIGHT SIDE WHEN THE STATUE FALLS

The guy in yellow <a href="">42:00</a> walking like nothing is happening

God blessed with Suriname we have no problem

there are lots of videos of nepal earthquake probably nepal is a frequent earthquake country

Soo scary was that day i can&#39;t remember it.

lets pray for Nepal

Im from california and just yesterday we had a 4.8 earthquake it was pretty scary but it was nothing compared to this !

i dont know whether to like or dislike the vid

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not in nelpa
These people have learned from their earthquake drills. GET AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS!!!

Poor people :(
Look at down left corner at starting <a href="">2:49</a> you can see the ground is cracking, holy crap

Woaah. I can see the ground just cracked in the third video. 

why get out of the cars?

Check out the moped rider at about 22 seconds.  He stops and looks down, thinking he has a  blown tire.

Those bastards deserved it

i helped for this poor country. we raised 10K dollars. I was a student parlement at my school. <a href="">#staystrongnepal</a>

God is great, Merciful, Mighty and Powerful, It is he who reminds us be prepared for the hereafter, Do good Deeds and do not make partners with him, As he is our master he can do what he want with us, But he is merciful we must repent and subdue to him, There Is no GOD but GOD and Muhammad Peace be upon him is his messenger

wait its Jan 12 how is it April wierd pls awnser

ITS GOING DOWN FOR REAL

There were 666 comments.I ruined it.

EARTHQUAKE...BIBLE MATEUS 24:1, NATION RETURN..TO GOD HOLY CREATOR...GLORY..JESUS IS COMING..GOD HOLY IS LIFE ETERNITY..AMEN..

What was the magnitude?

I&#39;ve ever felt an earthquake repeatedly, an amazing experience on my life..  this is nothing compared to tsunami earthquake (dec 26, 2004)

Looks like they were taught what to do during a earthquake.Good people in this country.

Good to see the cell phone networks weren&#39;t overloaded. More than a few people in the footage can be seen using phones. When we had a minor shake (compared to this) in Barbados on November 29, 2007, the cell phones didn&#39;t work. Hopefully, the networks have since been upgraded to allow more calls simultaneously. This region is actually overdue for a Magnitude 8 or greater quake.

help our country Nepal God please bless all the people in our country Nepal

all was peaceful and calm in Nepal until dun dun dun earthquake hits boom gone
If god(s) exists, it must have a great sense of irony. &quot;Hey let&#39;s have an earthquake in one of the poorest and least developed countries on the planet and see how they handle it!!&quot;Fuck you God(s).

I don&#39;t know why, but i love when people who don&#39;t know eachother work together to stay safe and well... alive.

O_O  was in 2 Minor ones myself in CNY:  Sylvan beach and oneida.   There is a Fault line that runs down from the adirondack Mtn. range  through Oneida lake down towards NYC (?)

Im glad they all knew to run outside in the middle of the street away from buildings that could fall on them

This reminds me of Godzilla

same thing experienced here in North India on 26-10-2015 just one hour back.....

Boy that&#39;s one ugly looking city

<a href="">0:21</a> it started

that must of be a very scary 

That is scary

I experienced it because I went there for holidays it was on 11 o&#39;clock and I saw dharara falling

I experienced it because I went there for holidays it was on 11 o&#39;clock and I saw dharara falling

For my birthday I wanted ¬£50 ($75.91) to give to a family in Nepal who needed it.

And that&#39;s why we are afraid of earthquake s

yes its pretty bad but why are the people are running to the road ?? i dont understand

Donate money if you can. Raise awareness. But Nepal&#39;s money comes mostly from tourism. So please, if you were thinking of visiting, visit it.Also, some people can&#39;t raise money. For some, praying is the best thing they can do. For theists, that is. Encouraging people to do more than pray is good, but saying it won&#39;t help is basically starting that age old debate of &quot;God doesn&#39;t exist&quot; which is NOT the conversation that needs to be had when thousands of people need immediate help.

Not to take away from the earthquake but did anyone else freak out watching those people drive in the beginning. I was pretty sure they were going to crash. I have no clue how they do that.

Despite 2 big earthquakes and less steel in building construction many buildings are still standing in Nepal which I saw on my recent visit to Nepal.I was very sad when I heard the news.I live in Australia.

Why did they all stand together? I seem to be the only Arab here
No! Its too soon... japan just had theires(4 years but whatev) we dont need large ones..

I am an Indian, and I have tears in my eyes after watching this video. I have a request to all my Nepali brothers, whatever loss has been caused to them and their country, I will single-handedly compensate each Nepali girl. In return for taking me to bed, I will die by throwing 10 rupees in the face of you Nepalis / Use that 10 rupees to fill your stomach, you motherfuckers!!!
shocking video fuck off
stabilize it
they stuppid

soon Jehovah will end all such earth quakes

I dont inderstand !!



I can&#39;t think of the terror these people had to go through. I live in a city, Istanbul, which is most probably gonna be struck by a powerful earthquake the country have ever experienced, and I was yet to realize what people went through until I watched a few videos of earthquake footage. I am scared out of my ass and can&#39;t even go out to see my loved ones. I am scared of losing them so much. I don&#39;t feel ready for the feeling of loss.

I hate earthquake 

BARBADD SAB BARBAD

- Where is it? The country of Muzhikland...
For any country prone to earthquakes, who are thinking of making videos to show people what to do in case of an earthquake.... don&#39;t bother.¬† The people of Nepal showed how to do it. ¬†As terrible as this event was, how amazingly brilliant did the people here show what to do during an earthquake.... and they did it immediately.¬† Pedestrians, people in buildings, people in cars/on bikes.¬† Perhaps other countries could pay to use this video as an example, and that money go towards helping the people of Nepal.

I really want ¬†to tell that most of the people are linking the Nepal earthquake on sacrificing of animals in the terms of Religion. One thing Our religion dont teach us to kill or sacrifice Animals, or even I do that. This all are the superstitious beliefs that came from ancient times and lots of people are following this trend believing blindly.I don&#39;t like Animals killing or scarifying while worshiping gods. And all Nepalease people don&#39;t follow those trend. There is no Question of blaming our Religion, just we blame the superstitious thought and its blind system.

<a href="">2:58</a> was that a dog the girl dropped?

People&#39;s lives are still being highly affected by the earthquake. ¬†Please consider contributing to rebuilding efforts. ¬†Even the smallest bit helps! ¬†<a href="">



i was in nepal at that time, but i was asleep and didnt notice the quake

Looks like Gadhimai is not very happy.

It had a contrary effect on my mood when I knew about all the people who died from the nepal earthquake.

nice to see smart people.. they doesnt hesitate a single min what to do :)

Wut? I thought you shouldn&#39;t get outside of the building during a quake, but Dropping, Covering and Holding on is the best option..

Do not kill animals for sacrifice.I have no sympathy for Nepal at all.They are now punished for their animal brutality.

thanks for good scene

Pray for Nepal and other countries

<a href="">gofundme.com/y9s9saq8</a>Help those in need! Donate today!

i think that due to killing of lots of animals(karma festival) leads to natural disaster

Clearly tells me that American cities need earthquake drills

Just make microwave jet engine solar space planes in china and water bomb the moon and mars and everybody can live in space.

Meanwhile in one of those buildings&quot;Shit, dropped my Nokia&quot;

this is so horrible

Amazing how they all stuck together through something as terrible as this but why do they all run to the middle of the road ????

<a href="">0:40</a> In the middle of the screen.. &quot;It&#39;s me, it&#39;s me, I farted.. sorry&quot;

that&#39;s bad that, I hope that Nepal survives this ;(

Lol you donated $300? So that means about $30, if that even, made it to Nepal. Donating doesn&#39;t help the govt&#39;s take it. Get a little smarter

At <a href="">2:58</a> you can see the cracks in the pavement on the bottom-left side of the screen start to rip apart! o.0

<a href="">#PrayForNepal</a>

We got earthaquake here, i know how it feels :(

i never forget you
     If you don&#39;t believe in fate or destiny then ask the driver of the white car at <a href="">1:58</a> what he thinks. Someone made what i consider one of the best comments ever about people as in strangers clutching each other during the earthquake. It speaks volumes of what life should be like!     I am usually the guy ripping up dumbass comments or replies. Like a few of them below but for this it&#39;s almost degrading to those who suffered, died or survived to even finish reading or do as I always did in here.     I&#39;ve had the honor of spending time with them on 2 failed attempts to summit Everest. The quality of those people is impossible to desribe and not sound cheesy. I remained in contact with a few Sherpas and their families and have tried to help where I could. The five Sherpas I know are all dead. The approximate 30-40 family members is now down to 9 who survived.     Ive never been involved or knew anybody  that was lost in a tragic event on this scale. What do you say or do to honor them? For me to truly honor them is to become a better person and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve chosen to do.     I can only guess what those that have suffered loss feel like when the tragedy is turned into a circus by conspiracy ass clowns. When this earthquake in Nepal is turned into the evil empires manipulation of mother nature as the cause. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll at least then have a better understanding for the term, &quot;going postal&quot;.     We had better get over certain things and get on with it before that time comes and goes!

Ronald William Hevey discussed how WeChat Payment is supporting UNICEF HK‚Äôs recent relief work, ‚ÄúThe devastating earthquake that struck Nepal resulted in severe casualties, massive destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Among the 2.8 million children affected by the earthquake, 1.7 million children are living in the worst-hit areas amid growing risks of disease outbreak. UNICEF HK immediately listed donation options on our WeChat Official Account aiding in the provision of water and medical supplies, to raise funds and meet the pressing needs of these children.‚Äù

Every earthquake is so disturbing.

Punishment from God

My school is giving hand sanatizer and can foods

Surat Az-Zalzalah (The Earthquake)When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquakeAnd the earth discharges its burdensAnd man says, &quot;What is [wrong] with it?&quot; -That Day it will declare its information (about all what happened over it of good or evil).Because your Lord has commanded itThat Day, the people will depart separated [into categories] to be shown [the result of] their deeds.So whoever does an atom&#39;s weight of good will see it,And whoever does an atom&#39;s weight of evil will see it.<a href="">quran.com</a>

Tiggo Bitties at <a href="">2:41</a>

Is that animals in the island in the middle of the road. See them running away from the concrete roof when it collapsed

Terrible really...i was at my home which is 700 KM far from Kathmandu that day and we all knew ¬†it was devastating earthquake though no idea how big and where was the epicentre .Within minutes,we started to get the news as we predicated and it was really bad news.God Bless Nepal.

fuck.... watching this while living in California at the same time when an earthquake risk is very high right now is unnerving. D:

really sad this happened to nepal but u can prove that u can take care of eachother!!!!!!!!

You ended the video with a heart?

Strange things r happening to our earth 200 species die a day either that&#39;s a coincidence or something really bad is going to happen 

does anyone know if diliprai is alright?¬†diliprai used to send me many videos and info about the kirat people and culture of nepal. the only thing that pisses me off is that diliprai wants to ban indian culture and indian films in nepal.¬†he also want to divide india. he wants northeast of india to breakaway and merge with nepal. he used to come to indian video and leave bad nasty comment........but i haven&#39;t seen him for awhile now.¬†i am thinking if he is alright since earthquake hit nepal. do you know dilprai is alright?

the reason¬† behind this earthquake is because the nepalese people before¬† the earthquake they killed over 300,000¬† animals¬† ,¬†¬† they killed all of those¬† innocent animals just to bring worshippers good luck for Nepal festival¬† !!¬†¬† there is no Gods !!it is¬† because¬† of this damn¬† ritual¬†¬† the earthquake happened !!!!why do they worship all¬† of those statues !!!¬†¬† statues¬† that dont¬† even feel !!¬†Allaaahthere is only¬† Allaah !!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† no damn statues¬†¬† no gods¬†¬†¬† !!¬†¬†¬†¬† there is only Allaah

It was in the UK as well

awesome
God bless the whole planet earthquakes can happen everywhere anytime :o

Those three strangers men hugging in the middle of the road broke my heart

God Bless Nepal and we will Pray for you Guys! Stay Strong...-Philippines

Wow..the man in the pedestal didn¬¥t even flinch!!

Looks like the people knows what there doing. Good job Nepal and God bless you all.

Waqala al-insanu ma laha
Another uneducated motorists in nepal why do they keep on driving? even you set your clutch to the top gear you cannot resist the 7.2 earthquake. 

We been having small earthquakes here in Dallas. I get freaked out when it happens I can&#39;t imagine if I were in that situation.

Not being disrespectful and i wasnt there but the christchurch New Zealand earth quake was a lot worse just we had less deaths because our buildings are more safe 

I like the goof ball at the beginning that just throws his bike down and runs into the middle of the street. I mean really? You couldn&#39;t just ride it into the middle of the street. You really want a building to fall onto it?

Americans wouldn&#39;t even hold on to each other they&#39;d worried about themselves. Should take some notes it could be you.

see the road cracked in <a href="">1:50</a>?

People sure know what to do in the event of an earthquake, thats some quick reacting. Donated towards aid in Nepal

Hijra Gaypali, Hijra country, beggar people and this earth camp, was it fun, these marchers should die like dogs.
I pray for the safety of this people.

Do not fear Death. Death is the destination where we all living creature goes , its no death ppl should fear, but u should fear about never beginning to life. If u still alive then its a chance for u to enjoy ur life and pray to ur god abt having a good place in the afterlife. God loves you. .  <a href="">#prayfornepal</a>

The Netherlands wishes you safety and a good life we in the netherlands are trying so much to help nepal we have rode kruis and giro so we just all wanna say : ; we hopen dat jullie snel weer een huis en een goed leven krijgen (we wish you a house and a good life fast)

Very smart people to go to the middle of the street

All these comments about Jesus and praying. Fundraisers help guys. Praying sends a message to, well, nothing

Warning from God.

Wyh did anyone actually die in this earthquaqe? doesn&#39;t look too bad, I don&#39;t even see anything falling in the footage

Okay, Nepal. There was an earthquake in India as well. Maybe not that intense but still.

Why they pal up like that ?

I wonder what conversations were shared amongst strangers during the time of the earthquake...

2 hands at work do more than 1000 in prayer. If you want to help, help. Prayer isn&#39;t help, it&#39;s delusion and false hope.

I'm bored, they don't talk anything that I've been bored hahahaha
im from manaus brazil i prayer for nepal!!!!

God blessed nepal

See how all the people huddle together.

thats why i live in the midwest where we only have to deal with, tornados, floods, hail, extreme winds and people from iowa

BE AWARE NEPAL AND BE AWARE THE WHOLE WORLD. WHEN YEAR 21 COMES, THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF HUMANITIES WILL COME TO AN END. TIME WILL START TO END. THERE WILL BE 1 LONG HOUR EARTHQUAKES WITH INTENSITY 12 TO INTENSITY 24 THAT WILL SHAKE THE WHOLE EARTH, THE SHAKE WILL RISE AND FALL, THE WAVES WILL ROAR OVER THE COASTAL LAND ALL OVER THE WORLD DESTROYING BILLIONS OF PEOPLE. FOLLOWED BY MEGACRAYO METEORS THAT WILL FALL DOWN INTO THE EARTH TO KILL THE REMAINING BILLIONS OF HUMANS. THESE WILL ALL HAPPEN ON YEAR 21, THE JUDGEMENT YEAR OF GOD. FOLLOWING TO THESE, THE EARTH WILL TURN TO DARKNESS FOR 3.5 YEARS.
scary shit! :S

You can see that it was a beautiful and clean city. What a shame that this happened...
pavement cracking @ <a href="">2:58</a> onwards :o

2 days before I posted this comment, an 7.8 aftershock occured!

There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
Awful eathquake happened in Nepal, a lot of people living outside their houses. We try to get donation for nepali people - for tents, food, medicines. Visit - <a href="">

1love to the people of Nepal

Look how small we are in comparement.

This is good lesson and punishment for them who are killing innocent animals you idiots. Mata never ask for bali , its bcoz u idiots want to eat. If you want to give bali then give your own or your families bali you stupids. If you never stop then mata ji will punish you more bcoz if you cant give life then you got no right to take life you aas holes

so lucky carin second video

Scary!!

Its sad to see that they dont know where to run to. no place is safe

The day Nepal stood still.¬† :(

Write on Yahoo: GO COMELYTRY this Trick :D

Omg and another one struck you guys again another earthquake. My prayers are with you

Allah is Akbar
God bless people in nepal, it is time to ask the Lord Jesus Christ for guidence for mercy and grace it is time to turn to God the father before it is too late get a bible those that don&#39;t know who Jesus Christ is, he died for your sins and he is waiting for you to come to him and ask him for forgiveness of sins and truly repent. Jesus is the way the true and the life.God bless.

i was really afraid that day (worst day of my life):(

Look at the man on the left side, he is a brave one :)

i am glad that they know what to do when an earthquake strike.. i pray for nepal

Namche Bazar had one this morning.

They deserve it! They slaughter thousands of innocent beautiful animals within 2 days for their ignorant religion. What goes around comes around!

Straight line of people on the street O_O

Nepal the bad times r yet to come.... remember the gadhimai festival... u have to suffer more... mother nature is just doing justice

I also thought it was beautiful seeing all the people holding &amp; comforting each other during those scary scary moments...says a lot about them.

Everyone bravely held on to each other for support, and where did the cop go?? I guess he high-tailed it out of there, LOL..

OH my god this is so sad , my tears just wont stop ... I would give all my money to those people.. ;x// i hope this never happens to you again.. gosh to noone ever..

This is not Speiburg, this is real. I&#39;ve got a bad feeling that this is all leading up to something really bad. Are there any volcanoes blowing right now, I wonder?

Wtf... that white car that just about mowed people over! Smh

shame the country did not sink into magma

God bless everyone in Nepal! If i had Money i would donate every cent :(

Look at the street crack in the second video!

Look at them run from the power of God. Such primitive stone worshiping beings.

<a href="">1:07</a> Humanity WINThe panic is incredible. God bless.

Hindu 81.3%, Buddhist 9%, Muslim 4.4%, Kirant 3.1% the idols and the isolators have been judged.Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Yah Veh, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan. Jer <a href="">51:52</a>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: Yah Veh shall have them in derision.

Let them ask their monkey or snake God to help them OR the 1000 gods that they worship ONLY GOD JEHOVAH OF ARMY CAN STOP EVERYTHING BAD IF THEY RETURN TO THE WAY AMEN
WTF JUST HSPPENED?

As a Pakistani feel very sad for brothers and sisters in Nepal. May God keep you steadfast

OMG I&#39;m so lucky eye don&#39;t get earthquakes

Plz help Nepal  don&#39;t angary do tend
Thats god work...no buffalo work ...will u still offering buffalo.....hmmm..maybe need 100000000....more buffalo.....please...god hungry...

Amazing seeing their organization to something like a natural disaster. A true demonstration of culture itself. If that happened here in Brazil, people would run desperate not knowing what to do. I would have been running like crazy!!! haha

who told u guyz to cut 5000 bulls.this is wat u get frm GOD

Kind of looked like a parade, and one guy shouldn&#39;t get out of his car..I am not saying that is fun or great, It was just sort of intriguing what happens when panic happens

why can&#39;t people be like that in a daily basis? why must we face a fatal scene where anything could happen to embrace the idea that we could/should/must love and protect everyone as precious... every life is worth more than anything, don&#39;t wait for a time like this to be kind to one another...

At this moment of suffering and need , ¬†Indians sent us date expired foods and old clothes . The Indian media made some unnecessary and fake news ... INDIANS ......GO FUCK YOURSELF ... BITCHES

looks like theres no damage

praying won&#39;t help......if u r praying to god,u better know it is god who did that.....wanna help,donate some cash,they gonna need it.....god only help rich ppl.....i have donated some,,,,now it&#39;s ur turn....have a nice day:)

<a href="">4:54</a> a heart edit transition

They do not want cut it down tree, destroy forests and make big big bulding.look at other develop contry they have prettiest bulding no walk without car and other wheel stuff.but this country seem no good system there but have good majority, own feelingness.they are smarter then developed country compare how they live.they shows us we are human being and people should have human nature activities around the world.god give them helping hand.from USA Minnesota

Once again, this demonstrates what I have always thought and said, &quot;We are all human beings&quot;. I could not detect anyone there from another planet. They all grouped together and sought comfort by holding hands...

Didn&#39;t see anything ...

God sends warning to astray people . SF is next look at all the gay congregation there !

the earthquake was caused by India. india is to blame.

i was in delhi

You can tell that it is not a seismic country because the first thing they do is panic and run without paying attention. Unfortunately, Mexicans are going through this situation and we already experience it and we have that seismic education. What we can really do is teach that evacuation to the people. non-seismic countries since there is no guarantee of anything, it is a shame what happened to them but stop profiting from the suffering of others
Excellent reaction, going out to the center of the street and calming down as much as possible to protect themselves, they were very lucky.
Notice the cracks getting larger on the ground at <a href="">3:00</a>

its only like 5seconds

This is what happens when they don&#39;t believe in God because they have so many idol&#39;s and they do bad, Micah 1:3 Look, the LORD is leaving His place and coming down to trample the heights of the earth.4 The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart, like wax near a fire, like water cascading down a mountainside.¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø WHERE ARE ALL THE gods THAT THEY HAVE , THE IDOL&#39;S THAT THEY HAVE THEY DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE PEOPLE, !!!!WAKEUP NEPAL THE REAL GOD IS CALLING YOU JESUS IS THE ONLY GOD.!!!!

Doesn&#39;t look that bad....the thing don&#39;t even move a lightpost.....and it didn&#39;t went for too long ....

OMG!

It&#39;s incredible to see strangers holding each other for safety and support. ¬† I really hope that people in other places in the world would do the same thing in similar circumstances. ¬†People are good by nature.

tho den.???????
At <a href="">3:00</a> watch the sidewalk in the lower left and keep watching...

its incredible how many people lost their lives in this earthquake when they all seem to be doing the same thing, running away from all buildings and into the road where there are clear openings, and holding onto the nearest rails in sight.i take it that the people that died were mostly inside apartment complexes and couldnt get out of the buildings in time.Napal, you guys sure know how to do a proper earthquake drill! good on you.

OMG! This video had me sobbing my ****ing eyes out!!!! I feel for the people of Nepal.

Holy shit, these people were losing their balance. That was quite the quake.

Bless the dead and injured. Bless those that suffered loss of family members. Bless those that have no home to go to. Bless the people of the World for helping hands. May the God of the Earth bring mercy for the people of Nepal. 

This is the reward for all who call upon another god with God. O God, forgive us, repent for us, and have mercy on us. O God, protect Muslim countries, repent to the heedless, and destroy the enemies of religion, O Ever-Living, O Ever-Living, O Ever-Living.
shoking video..very sad
They might not have the prettiest looking buildings,but they sure some damn good cctv cams.

Where they bundled up in the street to avoid the collapse of the building and to not fall???? 

This is sad my birthday was 4 days before

No reflections on the white building glasses at all. Blurs around &quot;digital&quot; people and vehicles. Lack of physics. Lack of proper shadowing objects. Im not swallowing this. Are you kidding me? I lost faith in India people. I thought India has best IT specialists,graphicians and programmers. But this is really CHEAP CRAP.

these are warnings from Allah the omnipotent king

This earthquake happened on my Grandmother&#39;s birthday, she died on her birthday back in 2003. Wow.

Wow! <a href="">0:10</a> quick thinking process. 

Sad

25 april 2015 <a href="">11:52</a> am. a grim reminder to us nepalese and the world that we are but ant&#39;s to mother nature. never forget, never again... pray for nepal

<a href="">

Our thoughts and aid are with the people of Nepal in this tragedy. May you never see this again. From Canada.

Glory be to God
Check out the ground in the bottom left corner in the last clip.

I love how they all run to the cars and help hold them in place, teamwork

FREE TIBETChinese puppet in Nepalese government, police and military should be shame of handing back those innocent Tibetan, who en route to India for better life, to China. Land grabber Chinese torture them before killing them.Save innocent peace loving people of Tibet. Nepalese police and military don&#39;t deserve a single rupee if they killed one innocent Tibetan or hand at least one back to land grabber murderers Chinese. Good Chinese should speak up against bad who controls China. 

Glory be to God Glory be to God
Gadhimai festival¬†is a sacrificial ritual that is held every 5 years at the Gadhimai Temple¬†of¬†Bariyarpur, in Bara District, about 100 miles (160¬†km) south of the capital Kathmandu¬†in the southern¬†Nepal, near the Indo-Nepal open border, adjacent to¬†Bihar. It is primarily celebrated by Madheshi tribal people and Bihari people. The event involves the large scale¬†sacrificial slaughter of animalsincluding¬†water buffaloes, pigs, goats, chicken, rats, and pigeons ‚Äì with the goal of pleasing Gadhimai, thegoddess¬†of power.<i>_____________________________</i>Exodus 20:3-5 (KJV)3¬†Thou shalt have no other gods before me.4¬†Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.5¬†Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I theLord¬†thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;THE NEPAL EARTHQUAKE WAS A CLEAR PUNISHMENTFROM GOD!

Brothers, hold on!!! Russia is with you!!! Please accept our sincere condolences for the tragedy!!!!
finally a good vid !

Did anyone notice that the road in Durbarmarg cracked open because of the tremor?

Today, a 4.2 earthquake hit near my house. It&#39;s the first earthquake I&#39;ve ever experienced and the second largest Michigan has ever had. So for the people in Nepal to have a much larger one, it really makes me realize how terrifying an earthquake could be

At <a href="">1:49</a> that white car at the right tho... Few meters back that thing could have crushed that car. Wew!



Watching the cracks develop in <a href="">2:42</a>

We all people pray for Nepal now

No God except Allah
why did they abandoned the bikes instead on putting them in the middle? or why the guys in the middle didn&#39;t just put the bikes on stand position O.o

them getting into the middle of the street is the BEST thing they could have done in a city like this! probably saved lots of lives!

I agree with john below me

This is amazing. In a time of great crisis, the Nepalese shows us strong solidarity by holding onto each other, stranger or not, they will not think twice about who they are holding hands with in a disaster.

Shame so sad some people lost there parents and so did a 4year old boy he was looking after his 2year old sister

That is scary

Did God just kill 6000+ people and injured 14000+ ??

May god be with nepal

Praying isn&#39;t going to help. If you really wanna help than donate some money or start a fund riser. People pray all the time and what has it gotten us NOTHING!! So get off your ass or shut the fuck up. I already donated 300 dollars in aid what have you done.

<a href="">1:48</a>

prayers and support to all those affected. Look at the bottom right corner of the video at <a href="">1:50</a> you can see the road crack from the force of the quake.

Thank God! He is everything! 

I believe in my heart, God is telling all of us; if we don&#39;t be as 1 then we have no....

0.32

Glory be to God, Lord of the heavens and the earth
