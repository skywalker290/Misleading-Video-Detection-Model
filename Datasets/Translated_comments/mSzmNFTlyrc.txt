Super thanks review movie malang   aditya roy Kapoor superhit anli Kapoor very well disha very nice and nice dictator mohit suri goosebumps ( now streaming Netflix malang its my fevourite movie).

If I was John Abraham, you would have enjoyed it a lot.
Malang is the movie on Netflix

Superb movie 
This still gives be goosebumps, what a fire trailer!!

Oh god
The Malang title track played in the trailer has a lot better tempo that the song released 

Kunal khemu Powerfully actor 
Anil Kapoor did not know who he killed from the door of the car. Who knows?
Who loves adi pl like
Aditya Roy Kapur&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Varun, Arjun, Ranveer, Ranbir What a hotttie

After watching the movie, I can say that Elli Avram has really improved her actingShe was surprisingly good in this movie

where can i watch this movie

Disha  Aditya ️️
Say whatever about the movie but the trailer is addictively awesome.

Well emulated Hollywood copy by Bollywoos as always. Still a light years behind Tollywood. Bottom line is, it&#39;s garbage. Shoulda let Telugu guys direct it. Music sucks too. Who wants useless Bollywood music during Crime Scenes? Garbage!Watch Telugu Movies and it would help if you didn&#39;t copy.

A movie of the Year worth watching in Cinema Hall ....

Aditya Roy kapur is the best actor 

Kill it 
At last i feel sad for jesse(elli avram)
The best ️️️️️️
My own comparison:Varun Dhaun (Badlapur) is better than Aditya Roy (Malang)Retish Deshmuk (Ek Villan) is better than Kunal Kemu (Malang)Overall the movie is Very Good, and well done Anil Kapoor &amp; Disha Patani

Exept being romantic still action killer

Awesome
Where can I find the full movie??

Poop poop poop 
Sooper movie trailer
My alll time fvrt movie...

Trailer itself contains spoiler <a href="">2:29</a> 
Today's night. where are you going baba
Fantastic song 
The trailer is for 18+ onlyBut the film (except some scenes) is superb

Amazing movie️️
Yaaar bollywood walon please please trailers main poori film dikhani band kardo!!!

Last movie that I watched in theater.

Please do not promote the dialogue which does not belong to the movie.

I like this story ki agar koi pareshan karo to bilkul bhi mat chodna apne dil ki suno ab me bhi hui malang

Watched the movie for Anil Kapoor became fan of kunaal 

Who is the killer???

Aditya so handsome

Nc lov u
Superb movie

Can you tell me more movie for watching  

Bring mentalist on Netflix plz

Malang movie dish patani and aditya Kapoor best charactor.....

Very wonderfull movie

Hey full bastard Bollywood

Very nice movie

Disha acting was horrifying...

Ellie Abraham&#39;s name is here but where is kunal khemu&#39;s name?

They should know how to make a trailer from TENET,no revelation !

This movie is amazing. Waiting for malang 2

When trailer much better THEN a full movie That&#39;s called &quot;MALANG&quot;

I jst subscribe on netflix but malang movie is not available in it, wht happen?? Can someone tell?? Feel like wasting my money, many bollywood films tht i can’t watch on netflix

Disha Patani is disturbing everyone with her sex in the movie...
Hello  Who khow movie like these

shraddha is not perfect for Adi.....Disha is parfect for Adi

I love the song ,it is my favorite song ,it is the best song of the world

Excellent movie
dearest bollywood why are all the lead females wite-skinned?

Kunal khemur sir  acting so well
Good movie

Movie ka trailer is so worst. How many spoilers they give. This guy is right about such movie trailers which spoils the movie. Spoiler alert for malang <a href="">

Came here after looking at the thumbnail..... cuz Disha Patani is DAMN HOT!!!

The movie was above expectations for me.

Most of the people are attracted by thumbnail 

Kunal khemu's acting skill was amazing in the movie 
Whydid you upload this tseries will copystrikeyou



I&#39;m sure everyone thought Anil Kapoor was the villain but then the plot twist happened in the film

or one Rajkumar Santoshi
In Bollywood, Mohit Suri, Anurag Kashyap, Rajkumar Hirani, Abbas Mastan, all these directors are useless if they don't watch a movie...
Who says it&#39;s malang and not Ek villian 2

If I was 15 I would have considered watching it.

The movie which was actually as good as its trailer

I am all ready watch these movie theatre now again  in Netflix

<a href=""> Medley Mix. You will enjoy every beat

Awesome movie

Just wanna See more movies like this &amp; Kunal kemu Waah Hee is Wow in every seen i want more from him

So glad to see the heroine&#39;s name before the hero&#39;s,THANKYOU NETFLIX!

Kurnal khemu&#39;s dialogue in adiya kapur&#39; voice in trailer ? Hum tino ek jese hai

You bastards.....what is Yamraj....jn Lna
Malang is the most underrated movie of recent times.. Kunal khemu completely steals the show.. 

Netflix always add flop movies 

What a brilliant movie?
One of the best bollywood movie

Please netflix ...its a very strong request ...please add naruto shipuddien english dub ... kindly buy its rights for airing .

Songs will remain in our hearts forever... although movie not

good decision by netflix to have this movie.

Awesome movie all team acting great special mr anil kapoor sir what a acting i also watch on Netflix 
Netflix kya anime fruit??? <a href="">#animeinhindidub</a> <a href="">#meravoteanimeko</a>
It’s an amazing movie, must watch.

Never seen a trailer which showed the whole movie , when I saw the film I felt like arre yaar film ka mazaa yeh saala trailer na kharaab kar diya

Well... Totally Thrilling Movies..  Best Part is Emotion  Support By Best Music And Song

Where is subtitle when you need one

Mrs serial killer kye kam tha jo ye dal diya???

Don&#39;t waste ur time else u ll get to know y it failed in box-office..disha beauty with out any talent.worst movie of Mohit suri

Did someone noticed in the movie the last call that anil kapoor picked the girl sounded like shraddha kapoor.

Areyy ghantey ka confession!

So abusing drugs n all r fine now....i think these movies r one of d major reasons for mny   teenagers to lost their lives on drugs......

1.3 billion people live as they live but have money problems
Onnu niruthikkudeyy?
Who’s here after actually watching the movie?

Yesterday I watched this film downloaded from Torr**t . Ek number faltu movie hai . Kuch bhi nahi hai isme .  . Don’t waste your time

Ga*nd lena mera mohabbat hai

Disappointed by mohit Suri..Still Ek Villian is the best suspense thriller..

Kunal khemu is the underated actor spoiler alert
Kunal kemu is the man

Movie was above than my expectation!! Mohit suri never ceases to amaze me.

Jhakkas bhai ki acting bade mast thee 

Garbage movie ,. .Waste of time 

Who has not seen the movie and likes it?
Today's darkness is about to get darker and where will the silence come 
Tere liye bs
Did I get freedom my love?
Now new kachra is add on netflix india.

Superb movie

Yesterday I watched Malang. Wow what a movie Side actors Anil kapoor and Kunal khemu is good. But the Hero heroin just show their body.Nothing in this movie. Bina haath ped ka film banaya.Worst movie

Kunal khemu is the main villain this movie.

How to download movies?
Awesome Movie you should all watch this.

A film which is destroyed by 1scene in the trailer itself

are Netflix we are now &quot;patal lok&quot; I am busy watching...some original series have been posted again...how many good things have been made...
Add Kgf in Netflix

Best movie 
actually typical Indian audience just don&#39;t have a taste for a movie they only consider Salmans that faltu movies  ,masala movies .......yup this movie is not a great great thriller ....but it is enough good for bollywood considering the other movies....and has a unique great taste ..........overall a good movie but didnt well in box office ....and this why the directors and producers get demotivated

At the end of the trailer they fooking ruined the spoiler

If you wanna watch .  Watch it for kunal khemu . They showed entire movie in the trailer but hided the real star of the movie ...kunal khemu.

In my opinion the trailer looks better than the movie...

Watched the movie in Netflix n came here 

Can this film live upto expectations i haven&#39;t seen this movie yet but i saw EK VILLIAN it&#39;s my FAVOURITE so far.....

Bogus movie wuth good trailer
Already watched
