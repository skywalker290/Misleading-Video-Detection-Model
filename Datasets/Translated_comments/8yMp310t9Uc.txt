Abnormal behavior of a stranger

When kjo used make good movies..

I think best work of Karan Johar it was good movie as always ahead of its time...don&#39;t forget this movie was based out of India for higher class and may be this must be a true story...

Bhai move name please ❤❤❤
I love how in rab ne bana di jodi has a callback to this dialogue (intentional or unintentional ) don&#39;t say goodbye tani partner just say hum hai raahi pyaar ke phir milenge chalte chalte

Love this scene..you shouldn&#39;t marry someone without loving them..this scene has a separate fan base

Put. This.  Movies.  Youtube.

<a href="">1:19</a> Dev didn't even give his wife's name that's why her name is Riya not given 🤣
If SRK ever had to make his CV, he cannot miss this scene to include in his resume...

Personally yeah movie mujhe bahut pasand aayi thi maine iss movie 🎥 ko Mumbai theatre main 7 baar dekha tha I am not Fan of SRK but whenever I saw SRK movie I Love him

Please upload full movie

Karan Johar has the power to make such a film. It is still not clear whether he is going to get married.
SRK ❤❤❤❤ so cute 🥰🥰🥰❤️
Did he say &#39;diya&#39;?@<a href="">1:24</a>

Nehi dhundo gay to nehi milega❤😂❤😂
I don’t know why I enjoy watching Srk playing a jealous character……

In today&#39;s world no body is your&#39;s

I don&#39;t believe in the relationship.

His wife and wife and children should give punishment by every god and society.

If a guy can&#39;t give a woman that respect he doesn&#39;t have the play with her emotions.

Why he gives him his Wife&#39; place.

Maya actually loves him.

He must give punishment.

Why she used Maya emotion.

Dev is the third class character.

From this it appears that the woman should remain hidden and not look at the dead.
Wow

Nice Emotional since....thrughtly Life......

666😮
Ok,,,Phir milenge,

If maya and dev had a good life , maya had kids and dev dint meet with the accident would they have still fallen for each other or stayed  true and loyal to their partners. Was it circumstance which brought them apart from their spouse?

This scene is so sweetttt

Only SRK can deliver this kind of phenomenal acting while eating a chewing gum 👌👌👌👌👌

When I first watched the scene, I almost cried on the background song in spie of language gap. Idk why but this movie has successfully made me do some reflections of what I had to go through. The scene had me right from the start.

Think about who gets married,,,nice quip
Love sharukhan😍
SRK means:-Sharukh Rani ???Kajol🤣
When u realize  the garden is hugeeeee....

The songs and background score of this movie are amazing. Dialogues were written beautifully. It was an underrated movie. I like this movie alot. It explores a different side from usual. And is just like life. You don&#39;t know if you&#39;re decision at the time will render right or wrong in future (Rani&#39;s decision of marrying Abhishek). But you still make them in the hope for the best, sometimes they disappoint, sometimes they&#39;re the best that you&#39;ve made. This movie takes this &quot;wrong decision&quot; approach and the it was excellently directed and acted. Don&#39;t know why this movie gets alot of hate.

This movie is opposite of veer zara, in veer zara, rani is helping so that preity and srk could meet and here she&#39;s in between them.

This is what karan Johar is capable of making &amp; writing. This KJo should return.

One thing about this movie is awestrucking  music it has,  apart from its infedility which is extremely wrong .....

This movie is Ahead of time ..

This animal reminds me of my little lion here on our sofa in our brown closet a great love never dies elisabete gonsalves aaa
written is not Mean... its all depends on act... srk a fabulous performance

Rani looking more beautiful

Rani Mukherjee is the best female actresses in Bollywood

What a charm srk has. the way he looks at every girl 💖😍

I love  too movies 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Nices  movie  🌹,🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
This was some dialogue, direction, and acting. Everyone nailed it to perfection. One for the ages. Damn you Karan Johar for degrading yourself with SOTY, ADHM, &amp; Rocky aur Rani shite.

Addicted to this scene

I&#39;ll appreciate the story writer and dialogues writer....ek aise issue ko point  out kiya hai...jis per kabhi kuch na likha gya na banaya gya....jab ki aise bhi log hai jo is trah ki problem face krte hain aur mentally boht stress ke saath jeete hain

I just love so much how effortlessly these actors nailed the characters they played.. those days were all so goddamn fine. New Bollywood completely lost it, sucks! Talk about performances but all they do is about looking good only, but sucks anyways 😂 I love when Bollywood movies full of Shahrukh, Rani Mukherjee, Kajol, Madhuri, Amir, Abhishek, Aishwarya Rai, Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan where those days all these faces doing movies frequently..

Best friends are best life partners

Khushiyo ka Rasta...jo tumhe me...best line...nahi hoondhogi to nahi milegi...thanks...
Super

2 well dressed people.. awesome shot... nice background music and depth of soul in dialogues..

Are you dirty?🤣
The emotion master,only Karan Johar can make this.

Why are her hands so dark...😏?

The 5  best movies of srk are DDLJ, Kal ho na ho, Kuch kuch hota hai, kabhi alvida na kehna, kabhi khusi kabhi gham.

It cost so much just for me!
Most bollywood movies are idiotic

My favourite movie ❤️❤️❤️
Ajeeb aadmi ho baith bhi gaye lait ke baat kare
&quot;Nahi dhoondogi toh nahi milegi&quot; so true...wish both of them would have followed this...

What a shit acting ! Over acting and no sense in dialogues delivery ! No wonder he is flip actor these days

Best wishes......But Jodi ......

I don't take advice from anyone but am always ready to give advice to others.
This feline reminds me of my little lion at home on our sofa and at the foot of our brown closet, I know he won't see this comment elisabete matos anjelo gonsalves aaa

Never say goodbye🖤srk
my day is incomplete without this video

This 3 min is so meaningful..

wowww nice song, l like it
One of the best scenes, sometime we need a stranger like this in our life 👍

When you realize that this is the same bench from Kuch kuch hota hai

HE GAVE PRETTY DECENT ADVICE...TILL HE TOLD HER TO FIND LOVE &gt; MARRIAGE!

Sometimes strangers seem better than our own.
&quot;Sometimes friendship leads to love...or then love doesn't exist...&quot;Supper line.

This fur reminds me of my little lion here on our sofa and at the foot of our brown closet I give her lots of kisses everywhere elisabete matos anjelo gonsalves aaa
Very natural. Recorded real time with no dubbing for once ! It makes such a difference to express emotions properly.

She should never have married. She wasn&#39;t in love. Maybe it was too difficult for her to get out of.

Very nice movie

<a href="">3:38</a> he said the irony sentence!!!!

I dont think dev and maya were selfish. They were helpless because they were in love. Everything fails infront of love.

<a href="">3:00</a>

Sarukhan sir best
Rani mukherji eyes are soo beautiful

I love this scene

Nothing Greater than SRK&#39;s Acting,...🔥🤩

This is an imposter of SRK nai fan.
Srk    always  love u     acting     is  no doubt  always  fantastic.   Rani   too

hair..just look at his damn hair.. i&#39;m jealous

That pchhak in the end by srk..

Please aplod full movie

I relate to each and every comment on this video,it was really way ahead of it&#39;s time and deserves a totally unbiased opinion of a person ,just like srk  dying in khnh was not acceptable but did happen, love after marriage also happen. Does that mean srk wouldn&#39;t make movies with him dying ,no,will this movie change my opinion for marriage ,also no

sahrukh khan movie
which movie&gt;????

I love the fact that this film is not dubbed, but recorded real-time. It means the actors can put real emotion into their scenes instead of sitting in a studio &amp; trying to recreate dialogue (which never sounds natural).

It&#39;s pretty nostalgic 💜

Nice movie 👌👌
I hate Rani in this movie

l like shahrukh khan
Demi Lovato
Gods

MY heart love move forward with Rani Mukherjee ❤️❤️ nice to meet you ❤️❤️
Rani I love you so much 💕
I love❤❤❤❤ all my friends👭👬👫
Karan Johar, you have become filthy. That&#39;s why dislike this video even if this scene is beautiful.

Hii

One fantastic pair.. love seeing them together.. misses them so much.. kudos to Rani and Shah Rukh.. can someone  please set the pace once more and team them up together.. for the love of their fans..

We need more srk-Rani movies.

I don&#39;t know what magic this background music has.. Whenever I listen to this music I completely lost myself.. This movie released when I was in 8th standard. But still it got my nerves.

Ohhhhhh my Gawwwwd ! How beautiful is the scene😍😍😍 SRK is just pure magic! God bless you!

Waw

I LOVE this film. It did much better in the UK &amp; Europe than India. Well done Karan. Great story, great writing. The way it tackled forbidden love was spot-on. Love it. And the songs of course.

Sometimes within whole life its impossible to understand  close relations and some people change life with trust,love,friendship.

Hit

This is called versatile acting ! one and only SRK ♥️

Shamsul huda

Kon kon sarukhan kO pasand karta hai like thoko bhai log

Worst movie of Shahrukh career

Srk best
Nice

NICE MOVIE🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Loved the movie

“If you do not follow me then you will not meet me”…
This is the kind of nonsense dialogues that happen in life.
Rani said this either in movies or in real life too, many people get happiness by ruling others.
Destiny.....

😍😍😍😍 what a beautiful meet!!!
Whoever follows this movie will find happiness throughout his life...it feels like pain to the ears...but practically there is pain...
Never say good bye,

Movie nameeeeee

Srk at his best.

Watch what Chowdhury Zafarullah Sharafat says about Regent Hair in this video<a href="">
You get married, have kids, have sex, don't love Lia...what do you want to say?
I just love rani mukherjee&#39;s voice❣️
You can marry someone whom you love wholeheartedly or have an unconditional feeling or have a different feeling… but you can marry someone who is in love with you… but you can marry someone who has the upper feeling… Shaadi...it is heard that love is cut off in life...per do couple chahe na to ny katam hota per jina na chahie or pyaar hota hai to life me kitne ho jaaye per pyar vo hi rehta ha...
Gone is the time of love, I love you less and less...100% true.
so fake lol

Nahi dhundhogi toh nahi milegi... Fuck mahn that hits so hard. Very apt

Karan johar is a best filmmaker

my favourite movie after silsila

Okay good bye taken back as per your words. Only bye

The worst movie of the World.

This film KANK was a big disappointment for me. Such big stars but poor storyline. Also, what really frustrated me was that Abhishek performance was better than SRK when really it should have been the other way round. Guys what do you think???

BGM is irresistible......... Kabhi alvida na kehna

The best scene and dialogue ... (very deep &amp; Devine) .. how beautifully written??? Hats off to the writer 🙏

Srk hair style is best

<a href=""> coffee art painting, tried for the first time! Please support and like!

Rani: Garden ganda mat jijiye I have just cleaned it. SRK: You are a mother.

Rani I  love her voice
After marriage you don&#39;t need Love but half dozen children to live in Reality. Otherwise this whole conversation between them is childish.

Maha chutiya actor and director

I miss you rani mukherjee.. rani mukherjee was best actor in bollywood.. whole bollywood will regret her loss.. you left us so much earlier..

Such bullshit

Kaun hai ye dislike karne wale chutiye?

The work I do is considered wrong. It is as if I have become an enemy of friendship. Trying to improve relations with someone leads to disaster. The more someone is helped the more he is in trouble. People hate me. I am alone.
Rain mukharji ji is not responsible for your acting
Srk.... Sometimes acts as amitabh bacchan...

Only in this film I can't hate infidelity, the theme is unique
Never say goodbye to anyone in real life, never say goodbye. Always say &quot; down the road we meet again😊&quot;
The movie was ahead of its time

Rani's voice is nice.

I just completed watching this shit. It glorified extra marrital affair as love ....this movie was very plastic....I don’t understand how actors in these movies got awards...i hate the way SRK acted in this movie ....two bachans only  did some good job...the ending scene the crying the convo , I couldn’t tolerate ....how bollywood survived with this shitty actors and directors......the screenplay , dialogue everything were worst....

Same bench and setting from Kuch Kuch hota hai

My all time favourite scene .. such a beautiful point.

Bollywood is the biggest load of shit ever 😂😂😂couldn’t pay me to watch these stupid cunts

This is the only movie where I see people in comments discuss  so many things about the movie and relationships. But in the end it just LOVE which keeps them going guyss..I love this movie .. direction, acting, songs , location , story line and background score all the phenomenal ❣️

All these movies kept the foundation of extra marital affairs prevalent in todays grown-ups ,who watched these movies in tender age...

Nice movies

real life m film jesa q nhi hota yrr🙁🙁
Marriage is an arrangement designed and dominated by men. Their physical needs are met but a woman keeps waiting for him to take care of her emotional needs which not many men even care about. Women suffer more in marriages than men.

Srk god of acting

in this scene, he&#39;s acting like Amitabh  Bachchan

SRK is really a good actor....pta nhi log hate q karte h

What should I do to describe this video? I will go crazy trying to explain it to you.
Wonder who gets married??? hahahaha.....
I cant relate to her situation.. it’s sad but that’s life..

Sometimes friendship takes the place of love or there is no room left for love..m

SRK at its best. No other actor comes close to him for such scenes. Wonder what has happened to him recently

Heart touching

It is true that friendship has become love.
Sometimes you have the heart of someone who you may never depend on, and when he leaves, you become dependent on him and live with his memory, and you never understand how much your heart gave him hope, and you also feel yourself with his presence. You knew love in the spring. Nasreen. Einstein. Your little white flower. Fish.
