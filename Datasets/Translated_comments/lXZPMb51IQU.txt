Saquib Shastiker too good 
In olden days women were best at singing and dancing. Before modernity

That is the advantage sanskrit gets

If they are interested in music many people listen to just shastriya Sangeet (women). That is why Veera Raja Veera works.

That director is not true. Best music or Best film. (Women)

If you believed all music in movies will be carnatic (women)

It&#39;s possible for individuals to have different preferences and biases based on their background, experiences, and cognitive abilities. Non-visual individuals may have a heightened appreciation for music directors, while brainy individuals might prioritize the director&#39;s intellectual prowess. However, these are just stereotypes and don&#39;t necessarily hold true for everyone. Appreciation of film is subjective and can be influenced by a variety of factors.ChatGPT 

Jokes only

You have to pretend runners up is best (Anurag)

All the other prizes are runners up (Anurag)

Absolutely, you&#39;re correct. The &quot;Best Film&quot; award recognizes the overall synthesis of all the individual elements of filmmaking, acknowledging that even if a movie might not excel in every single category individually, the way these elements come together can create a cinematic experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. It underscores the importance of cohesion, synergy, and effective storytelling in creating a memorable and impactful film.

Whether &quot;The Dictator&quot; movie by Sacha Baron Cohen is considered &quot;junk food&quot; entertainment can vary depending on personal taste and perspective. Some might view it as a satirical comedy with elements of political commentary, while others might see it as lowbrow humor. Ultimately, it&#39;s subjective and can be enjoyed by different people for different reasons.

Maniratnam should make the best junk food films.

Venkat Prabhu&#39;s film &quot;Chennai 600028&quot; can be likened to cinematic &quot;junk food&quot; due to its focus on light-hearted entertainment, humor, and easy-to-watch storytelling. The film revolves around a group of cricket-loving friends and their misadventures, offering audiences a fun and enjoyable experience without delving deeply into complex themes or narratives. It&#39;s the type of movie that provides quick, guilty pleasure akin to indulging in junk food for a temporary escape from reality.ChatGPT

&quot;Golmaal&quot; can be considered cinematic &quot;junk food&quot; in the sense that it offers light-hearted entertainment with slapstick humor, much like indulging in a snack for a quick, guilty pleasure. The film prioritizes comedy over deep themes or intricate storytelling, appealing to audiences seeking easy-to-digest entertainment. However, just like with actual junk food, enjoyment of &quot;Golmaal&quot; is subjective, and some viewers may find it delightful while others may dismiss it as superficial.ChatGPT

They should give an Oscar best film to grand Masti and entertainment. That would set a new norm.

Junk food filmsDescribing &quot;Grand Masti&quot; and &quot;Entertainment&quot; as &quot;junk food in cinema&quot; can be a subjective interpretation. Both films are often classified as adult comedies with slapstick humor and rely on lowbrow jokes and situations for entertainment. Some viewers may enjoy them for their light-hearted and escapist appeal, akin to indulging in junk food for a quick, guilty pleasure. However, others might criticize them for their lack of substance and reliance on crude humor, likening them to cinematic junk food that provides temporary amusement but lacks nutritional value or depth. Ultimately, whether they can be labeled as &quot;junk food in cinema&quot; depends on individual perspectives and tastes in film.ChatGPT ️️

Even script
People want to believe in logistical issues like call sheets, foreign visas, pregnancies and so on.

What I said is true but people do not want to believe that.

It works just like tamil poets 

Joke or serious do not know : Many people believe there is no category and if you spend more money you make better film like Bahubali or Adhipurush

If there&#39;s only one award category, it should be for the &quot;Best Film&quot; as it encompasses the collective efforts of the entire filmmaking team, including the director, actors, writers, cinematographers, and more.---I am only picking best film. That&#39;s all that matters and not AK vs AK

In many movies director has to just hold camera. (Anil Kapoor)

Yes, some movies are primarily identified by their actors, while others are more strongly associated with their directors.

I did a theoretical search with ChatGPT and directors are more important for better films than actors. However people do not go to watch better films but just actors they prefer even irrationally like junk food. If audience viewership is a criteria then winners are actors. If just films independent of viewership than directors. This is the theory.Basically it is a philosophy problem: If a tree falls in a forest and there is no one around does it make a sound.

What a movie mahn.. 

Anil Sir️️️
I STILL WONDER FOR WHAT REASON ANIL KAPOOR IS WEARING AIR FORCE UNIFORM.....THEY ARE DISRESPECTING A SOLDIER&#39;S UNIFORM ..SHAME ON BOLLYWOOD

Oh god, who thinks this dude actually love to sonam. He doesn&#39;t match to a father

Which idiot liked this movie? And why, this insult to the uniform of INDIAN AIR FORCE will not be tolerated, no matter how little it may be....I don't like to wear the uniform the wrong way, I am an AIR FORCE BRAT myself, a defense aspirant, isloye dil p lgta h
What a waste of time

The best part of this movie was when Anil Kapoor gets hit by a car and Anurag says “Shot Liya na”. Shows how mercy less and mad film maker his character is.

awesome movie bhai climax is best

Wat a movie,,, I&#39;m a big fan of AK bt now I am also a big fan of AK who plans the script(those who have watched will know it, and those who haven&#39;t go and watch it)

The film insulting the indian air force

My big question Is it real is or not ?

PLEASE MAKE AK VS AK 2

I like the creativity

Awesome. Not going to miss it.

That brother is that
I just f**kin LOVED THIS MOVIE !!!! what a masterpiece comedy by both the AKs !!!

I am confused is this all real or just acting ?

The end is so unexpectable ! One of the best movies i have ever seen

AK bar inhe  border pe bhejo

Another FAN movie of SRK.

it’s a mockumentary

Demeaning the dressess of our defence forces is their thing right now!

People who think this is real, are the same people who think Shaktiman is real.

<b>both AKs have disregarded our defence forces, foul language &amp; disgrace to the REAL MEN IN BLUE (Defence officers).. down down!</b>

What an amazing concept

I highly doubt what anand ahuja was doing at that time

Father's father's father's brother's brother's best friend will take his kashup.
Bollywood legend in a video production looks cheap and sad (hehheh Bollywood in a nutshell btw). Film actors were selected to be photographed on FILM!   Hire new actors that suit video cinematography.

What a fool you are?

The best role played by Sonam Kapoor; other than the last few seconds of her during the credits, she was brilliant throughout the movie. Hope she takes on roles like this

The movie is good because his surname is KAPOOR !!

I&#39;m literally confused.It&#39;s looking like its a movie about real life incident happened to Anil Kapoor.

JHAKAAS MOVIE!! A Breath of Fresh Air from Bollywood, thanks to Netflix... Excellent and unique Concept, Superb performance from Anil Kapoor, proving that his career is faaaar from over! Even Kashyap&#39;s acting was surprisingly good...Must Watch! Hope enough people appreciate the efforts to create something new....

Dumb sonam kapoor

Is ak vs ak 2 happening??  Wana see anurag takin revenge lol

Fakeness at its peakAnil kapoor is searching for sonam kapoor by showing her picture and asking from civilians.

Trailer park boy,
Sonam:  dad
Worst thing in this movie was sonam kapoor!

AK vs AK based on True Story 
Anil kapoor is a fucking blessing to India. Nothing but respect for all he&#39;s been doin for his craft, especially at his age.

Earlier I thought AK vs AK was Arbaz Khan vs Arjun Kapoor 

The trailer is full of spoilers. Please dont watch the trailer b4 the movie

Wait.... What&#39;s it I didn&#39;t understand movie or behind the scene Last question what&#39;s it I really didn&#39;t understand 

No Nawazuddin Siddiqui was harmed during making of this movie 

Aawwsm yr.  Just go and watch u won&#39;t regret it . Just go now

Why people are hating on this movie ?

Abe actor ke naam pe dabba re gaye dono,Worst Netflix ever

Far better than varun dhawan&#39;s coolie no. 1

This has no connection with reality, if it happens then it will be called a coincidence with Sonam Kapoor.
One of the best movies  

New concept great concept

Achcha hai sonam kapoor ko nhi liya varna flop jo jati ????
The best cinematography is years...loved it....

Disappointment

Mera bhi surname rathore hai mujhe bhi le le ...Ek aat episode me fit ho jau to ..

Superhit is
The film is more like Table no. 21 , but the latter is much better than this.

Spoiler alert: They hit  the camera a hundred times in this movie

Dawood ka sath hein yeh anil kapoor.. dont support him.. nhi bharosa hota toh search krke dekh lo

Very stupid and double standard

This would be the best film of the year.

You gotta be more DARK Kashyap!!!

Oooofff. Sheer rubbish
Anurag Kashyap always does something different 

Life is strange some people come in our lifeThey make us happy they make us laugh theyTeach us love and then Someday they doAway somewhere neither you can find them Nor u can forget them just the memories u have with uYou remember those beautiful moment and smile And LIFE GOES ON

thuuuuuuuu
thuuuu thuuuu
aaaathuuu
Sonam Kapoor&#39;s Best Performance yet

Trust me Anurag is telling truth about Bollywood in this movie 

Anil Kapoor playing actor, as a actor proves &#39;director is more important for a film as compared to a actor&#39; in a fight of actor Vs director.

Why if dress

Just watched movie... must watch 

I couldn&#39;t understand anythingWill anyone please tell me the meaning and content of this superb trailer

What portion of youth did Anil Kapoor drink? 
Super hit

Good movie... I personally don&#39;t like anurag kashyap... But I love his work...This time again...Anurag&#39;s acting wasn&#39;t that good ..But it wasn&#39;t that bad too.Baaki it was an out of the way movie ..

Finally bollywood is doing the right thing. Kidnapping Sonam Kapoor

last tk movie ni real story lag rhi thi its really confusing

I never thought this movie will be that amazing

Superb movie!

This thing is so fucking confusing.

Is it a trailer of a film or behind the scenes or reality show or talk show or what the heck ???

Different kind of film, worth one time watch, the best thing is how the actors are so comfortable playing real life characters and letting certain things be on the reel. Good story telling and extra marks for the commendable performance of actors.

I kept doing realistic acting as much as even Nawazuddin could...
Anurag Kashyap 
Nice  direction 
even a little
Atleast, Anurag saved us from Sonam&#39;s Acting. Thanks Anurag 

Everything is OK good experimental in Indian cinema, but purposely missed d Valimai Updated....

Duniya ki bakwaas tree movie
No Kapoor were harms in these movie

Worst movie

Rubbish….He would be in a bad mood if he saw Sonam's face.
bad, drunk
STOP DISRESPECTING ARMED FORCES ONLY FOR ENTERTAINMENT ... NOT ACCEPTABLE 
Am i the only one disappointed by not finding Arvind Kejriwal in this?

Chalo kuch to acha dekha

The worst kind of movie

Hope he never finds sonam 
Very nice filmTotally different concept

Yesterday night I watched this movie and yr no words just outstanding ️️

now this is a movie unlike....sadak coolie no.1 staring varun dhawan

Hey, what a wonder we have created!
Nawazudinn is best realistic actor.Anil kapoor; hold my bear

New

Sir, it&#39;s not good sir you are disrespecting our 🇮🇳INDIAN AIR FORCE uniform you don&#39;t know the value of this uniform.

What a movie man! Way to go Netflix. We expect this type of content more!

One of the legend trailer ️

Anil kapoor is still Jawan...

I really confused , is this movie trailer or behind the scene ? 

Kutty ke tarah lad rahe ho

God knows when will Sonam Kapoor start acting bhai? Have you started watching this? Where are you now bhai?
it&#39;s awesome

loved the movie  

So it&#39;s a mock kidnapping found footage film with self aware actors playing themselves. Gotcha. Cool concept but not really anything new.

My rating for this film 4.5/5️

to Anil Kapoor, Jakkas to Bakvaash; to Anuragh Basso, totally time-waste

The best dialogue of the movie was the Taxi Driver saying &quot;Aur kya bolte Anil bhai&quot;

Just watch. This is unique indeed.

Kya bakwas h

The acting has been amazing from both, but it&#39;s just too huge a gamble to have released in theatres, for a general audience this won&#39;t work, it would be a flop as the content is not new except the characters themselves for real, not expected from Anil Kapoor atleast!! Atlast Netflix has promoted this for the least to say promoting the negative side of Anil Kapoor. It&#39;s a comedy more than a thriller

️Sounds like Ak
Imagine running out of ideas.

This film restored my faith in Hindi films. An outstanding concept and execution ️

just saw the movie. It was a waste of time. Justbullshit

Finally 1 good movie after so long .

What a movie, Anil Kapoor 

Wow Sonam ek film milla

Sonam ki mardi. AK NE 
May Allah protect everyone with mercy
sonam kapoor na mile to badiya he . anil kapoor ji app sabse no 1. I am an actor
waooooooooo

This is something i have never seen even in hollywood tbh !!!!Hats off to you guys

May be  trying to make an Indian version of &quot;A Serbian film&quot;. Definitely  not 18+ though 

Movie was fantastic .....OMG

I keep making songs for the public
motherfuckers who disliked the movie trailer this was the best movie i have ever seen

New way if making laymen FOOLS and fall for such idiotic Bollywood stunts. SHAME ON NETFLIX 
Superb movie

Why tf this bollywood guys are getting into netflix ?

Who come her to abuse........

What a movie

Why are you making hemorrhoids?
After watching the trailer, it seems like unique content and a different way concept. I&#39;m going to watch it.

it&#39;s like watching a dog and wondering which one it has is head or which one is tail even though you know the answer

Anil Kapoor:- meri beti lapata hai.Poora desh khush ho gyaafter some timeAnil Kapoor:-yeh film ki script haipublic:- yeh bik gayi hai bollywood, ab bollywood me kuch nahi rakha

Sonam kapoor had 2 minutes of screen time in this movie and that too without any dialogue but somehow she still managed to be the worst thing in this movie along with her annoying brother 

Bakwas movie time west

Bachalo use drugs se

Lousy bollywood fuckers. Bunch of wannabes bastards

I&#39;d always thought is it possible that will there be any movie where they&#39;ll use the real names of the actors and here it is!! I&#39;ve always been  a Anurag Kashyap movie fan but here we see a good actor in a brilliant director.... climax was crazy!!

i first open thus movie and thought its some kind of documentry and shut it

This is not your best movie sir But good casting main Anil Kapoor is best and only actor And camera work is superb Hope you make this again 

Very good movie!

Wow... What a movie....it was such a wonderful movie

Great respect to iaf uniform well done guys. Pahele ekta kapoor aur ab ye ... Great

full movie credit goes to camerawoman girl 

What have you done to Bosadi? Both of you are fooling the public with your name. Seeing this, I felt like abusing my mother and sister for years.
This is the disgrace of IAF's uniform.
Harshwardhan was so damn Irritating yaar. All he says fuckin Fuckin Fuckin. Highly irritating.

Is he showing Sonam&#39;s pic to the public while looking for her? Seriously?

This can be the Human version of finding Nemo

This movie is one of the worst movie in my life...completely wasted time...
Anurag Kashyap&#39;s jacket name ? Adidas which edittion?

The policemen lol what an acting sir

English movie ka copy
Hug given friend
You must include the director of films like Gangs of Wasseypur 1 and 2

Ganjawalo's movie will be like Ganjawalo's (Bhadve Saale)
What are you doing Roy, I am feeling like a movie 
Thank god sonam not much in the movie 
In the movie all time anurag say to anil.kapoor  - anil sir and sirBut anil kapoor &#39;s son harsh say to anurag all the time - fucking anurag

Acting me reality  reality me acting Jo samjna hai samjo

I don&#39;t know about people disliking this video. just gonna say if people wanna see talent in Bollywood. This movie is fucking brilliant.

BOMB OFF️
What a time it has been. First watch the trailer of the film and then go to the cinema hall without taking permission from the family. And today, watching webseries by watching the trailer of webseries is happening without anyone's permission, still there is no fun...Miss old days...
Mene ye movie dekhi What a fresh content   Sach m maza aa gaya

Its a shame that just because its an Anurag Kashyap involvement that the film needs so much swearing. Why? Just because you are on Netflix and world is watching, doesnt mean you have to use foul language to get noticed.

Bestest movie i have ever seen
Mind blowing ️️️ I love ak vs ak kuch alage hai 
I finally ended with Sonam kapoor Nai milti.. :p
Just watched, it&#39;s what bollywood need, audience needs to support these kind of films, awesome concept loved it, baap ka dada ka bhai ka sabka badla lega re tera Kashyap

It&#39;s a diamond don&#39;t spread hate dislikers, it&#39;s the difficult work of 7 years which is real and appreciable

Wow!!

This called a movie

I thought it was Akshay Kumar vs Anil Kapoor but .... you disappointed me

Chuthiyone chuthiya bana hain hai 
<a href="">0:46</a> ide gaaaas hahahahahha
Is it kamal hasan movie remake i don&#39;t remember the name but i have watched that movie!!

Masterpiece!! ... This one goes out only to AK and AK (but no other actor in the film) 

Sonam Kapoor&#39;s best performance to date! Bravo, bravo, bravo!

Don&#39;t disrespect our GREAT INDIAN ARMED FORCES...
Super fitness of Anil Kapoor...amazing actor

This was very good...climax was let down

AK vs AK is just a treat to watch... it has all the material to hook u up... Superb performance, Direction, Real vs Reel plot, 5 stars for the Jhakaas performance n direction...!!!!

Worst movie

Table no 21 ki copy
Kya Bawaser hai yeh?

Trust me, the movie is beautiful 

kasam se mind fucking blowing movie ......suspense , thrill, acting ,story ........real masterpiece

Blockbuster movies of 2020

Ak/ anurag kashyapAk/ anil Kapoor

Vikramaditya Motwane is magic.

Wow dislikes People are still alive 

Snake  Kashyap
KAPTI KASHYAP

Wah Nowadays, after watching Indian movies and Netflix stories, it seems as if there is a mix of Shikarpuri jis main Bollywood and Indian Air Force's band baja de jate hai hahahaaaaa  
Finest work by a director n actor ️️️️
Office sitcom style movie
Best film of the year. .. 

It Quite Different from regular Bollywood Stuff ........Great movie

really go and watch it this is such a nice movie .........

Why so many dislikes, it&#39;s a great original idea for a movie. Don&#39;t let it flop.

this movie flipped me

I was laughing to see some parts of this ak vs ak trailer. They was a part where anil kapoor is dancing and anil kapoor hit by a car.

Better than disgusting Coolie No. 1 
What a joke is this?
Good web series

disgusting movie, anil kapoor had tried his best as his acting skill was outstanding. but anurag had ruined everything. i don;t reccomend to watch but if  you have so much time to waste then go ahead

NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE THAT ITS TRUE EVENT MOVIE., THE WHOLE PREPLANNED BULLSHIT....

How they shoot the movie?

I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AND ITS JUST FABULOUS , NOW ALL I WANT IS THAT NETFLIX MAKE ITS 2ND PART ASAP!!
This is masterpiece

I don’t understand anything it’s confusing is this trailer or making of the film 

Very nice

THIS MOVIE THIS is IT. This is Indian cinema. For anyone hating on Anil you all should stop it with your pseudo intellectual opinions. The guy is 64 , he is also literally the best part of the movie not a fan of Sonam but she couldn’t ruin this movie for me at all. The storyline and Anil’s acting was THAT GOOD. WATCH IT jeez support these movies. That’s the only way for commercial movies like coolie to stop existing.

Mastt hai Movie -- Bilkul different --- 1 time Must watch 
Awesome movie

Why that uniform

Never expected this kind of masterpiece from Bollywood.

Damn Anil Kapoor is ageless

Jhakaas/ AWESOME,UNIMAGINABLE SCRIPT
Awesome anil kapoor sir u are the brilliant real life actor

Oh my God it&#39;s amazing 
<b>Ayyappan and Koshi ak</b> 
Sonam kapoor lapata hai Sonam Gupta bewafaah haiii

Bakwas

Omg , it's jhakaas
Netflix kya hag diye ho be...in lawso se humko dur hi rakho...behenchod Bollywood
It&#39;s a must watch, Oscar winning film.

Awesome bole toh ekdam Jhakas..!

Took the viewers' top
Too bad movie
this is something new ........ love it

Car accident lol.. Bakwas

Bycod bollybod ak............ He is making a lot of mistakes but what to do?
Every setting and everything is nonsense 
Maja aaya hame
now i&#39;m going to watch this movie..... thanks to bnftv

What nonsense 
Flop

This movie really gives you an edge of the seat experience with super tense Bgm .The chasing and violence looks real , though it&#39;s scripted , Obviously .Lots of awsome One-takes and great camera work .Also it makes you laugh sometimes . One of the finest movie in 2020 .[Spoiler] Baap ka ..Dada ka ..Bhai ka ..Sab ka badla lega tera Kashyap .

Different concept. Great

The end really got me! This is outstanding, kudos!

That is a Trailer or Behind the scienes.What happen in Bollywood.?What they want to do?Ans: Wait &amp; Search...

Come on.. sonam kapoor kidnapped hui toh picture hua hua
gangs of wasseypur 3 kab ayegi

So these things became more and the movie made them even more.
'Saala yala mhntat acting' 
Maybe Bollywood can also make good movies
Iss movie ka Naam behind the movie hona chahiye tha

Will watch for Anil, Sonam and Anurag

After  BnfTv review

A rare gem is headed in bollywood . Wish more like this come.

Thank god she got kidnapped

Outstanding Movie  Worth to Wathc 
is that movie ?

Why??

Pura jhakash mafik

it is pretty interesting that Bollywood is now making found footage style films I mean seriously that&#39;s interesting

ye asli me anil kapoor ke sath hua tha,sad

Just time wasting to see this tharki movie

Wow️
No need to find her 

Abe ye kya bakchodi hai be, Ye anurag to mujhe lagta hai Daut hai shala Dubai me plastic surgery kara ke india me aakar ,  maje. Se jee raha hai...

Brother, have you seen the movie? Osm. Gjb. What a twist.
Kya chutyayi film hai bhosda mtlm kuch bhi ban rahe ho sb sale tumlog gnaja mar liye ho sb ka re
Finally we got something new from Bollywood ...

One of the best Indian movies this year.

This is too good

This is  really something new...it was outstanding 

Well i love how confused I am after the trailer lol

If you notice the background music is do you love me

But we all know ... The real AK is Akshay Kumar

25k dislikes are from mindless people who can&#39;t appreciate a unique screenplay and story.

This is masterpiece.Vikramaditya Motwani&#39;s potrayal , the way he cinematise it is way ahead of it&#39;s time for bollywood audience. Ye log Coolie no. 1 ko gali denge ki ye cringy typical bollywood hai and on other hand aise experimental, true cinematic experience ko accept bhi nahi karenge.... Waah rey Indian audience

Good movie

This is clearly way better than any experimental film ideas , anil kapoor and anurag spices them beautifully anil kapoor 40 saalo se hero hai aur aakhri saas tak hero rahega...

Guys first watch then comment yaar

This will test our brains for sure

third class movie

Next level concept 
Avoid this anurag keshyap

By giving such comments, you will be fooled for years. Ever think why do these people treat the army because it is planned, their only motive is how BHI can destroy its army people.
Khel karta khalaas. Bhai tera jhakaas  superb performance. Anil Kapoor is back and khakaas
Just watched.. It&#39;s diff climax was best part of the movie

The most logic less thing he has made! Anurag you can never match the level of Hollywood.

what a movie ! Both AK Nailed it love it

I will try ke anurag kashyap ki dobara koi movie na dekhu...Worst story total bakwas.....

Stupid movie to glorify movie actors...

SAME DIRECTOR WHO MADE A BRILLIANT RAJKUMAR RAO STARRER TRAPPED 
Dear Stranger who are reading my comment may their parents live 100 years️

Kaya movie hay bancho hahaha .wow ️ .just wow
it&#39;s somewhat like the truman show

Even Anil Kapoor will not go after Sonam,
Rrr movie weiting
Better watch John Cena&#39;s 12 rounds

experiment k naam pe kuch bhi..anurag is no way near “a” of acting..as an actor needs proper classes..pls get some..focus on what u do best..anil kapoor is a fantastic actor...but overall this is a bad movie

Anurag Kashyap Vs Anil Kapoor Ak vs AK
JhakaaasDiffrent concept A must watch movie ak vs akTill end it make me felt real

The reason I won&#39;t watch this movie because it is a movie.

Apni family ko time do Don&#39;t vest your money on Drug ywood

Faltu

Sonam atleast 2 % seko tere baap see acting

<b><i>Its real Experimental Movie And Rock Moviei Wtch this Movie Out cLass</i></b>

KUtta 
Kutta
I don&#39;t understand the amount of dislikes on this trailer. The movie is so soo good. Definite watch for everyone.

What a filim yaar..!!

This trailer is so confusing don&#39;t know this trailer shows behind the scene or it&#39;s just a official movie trailer. I wonder how much the movie will confusing 

Watched this movie today. And i really liked it. It was a fresh concept and anurag was a treat to watch. Plz dont spread hate without even watching a movies.

Abhi has come to watch the movie...movie bole toh jhakkkaaaasssss
It was good movie... Actually but at the time sonam came in the movie.. It was blunder...

Super moves aaj Maine देखा Such me both are great ak vs ak
Well done excellent  Anil kapoor 
Abe tweets ki war dekh k lagta h sach m aisa ho rha h ...

It&#39;s like &quot;lost in London&quot; and &quot; blind spot&quot; people who interested in this go and check these masterpieces too

Only thing I absolutely hated about the movie was forming a conclusion at the last...the movie should&#39;ve been kept grim...gloomy and dark....kya zarurat thi last me....&quot;mere sath meri puri family act ki&quot;...no I mean the concept was mind-blowing...agar last ka 20 minutes nahi dekhta na...to probably till date this would&#39;ve been the greatest movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life....just the reason why I ain&#39;t much attracted to Bollywood films is this...why Conclusion?Dark rakh do...aur kya... audience theories to hai hi...but moreover mind-blowing job....

Vs akshay kumar bhi kr lete ek canada citizenship phek ke marta gend phat jaati

Vs akshay kumar bhi kr lete ek canada citizenship phek ke marta gend phat jaati

Salute to Anurag Kadhayap
Jhakassssss...

Not a good film

Just watched it. Superb movie! Anil Kapoor is amazing in this one!

Ak beta ke sath ak baap

Yes, I would like to do this again with Anil.
Very often you get a chance to get rid of trash like sonam.... I hope anurag kashyap wins 

AK vs ak is available full movie on my channel check it out

This was movie trailer or movie&#39;s behind the scenes trailer

First thing Anurag kashyap did is kidnapping Sonam.

Anil Kapoor It is necessary to wear your air force uniform, it is important to wear it, why do you keep wearing it?
He was in such a mood that he rang the jingle bell...
bro its a total disrespect of an airforce uniform .man how are  we guys are enjoying this it -takes a lot of fukin guts to earn it man,and that to uniform of armed forces!!

C u soon dkhlo ja k
Wow... What a great script ... Great actor....   Anil Kapoor 

Anil Kapoor acting is like Aamir khan in this movie

I just watch the movie it was great movie in 2020 who agree me and who don&#39;t comment

The movie was very fantastic

I just saw this film. Brilliant act of anurag sir. Best film.

I hate Bollywood

This movie was epic and a masterpiece,must watch this flim

Sonam Kapoor lapata hai, toh dhundhna kyu hai?  ;-)

I never saw that trailer and it came to my mind.
Meanwhile Sonam  was at hers friends house thinking it was a prank be like:- *lode lag gaye plays in BG *

Sucharita tyagi is here wooohooo

cringe
spoiler alert : AK VS AK part 2 me anil kapoor ka beta kidnap hoyenga

Audience: We want something new. Something out of the box(camera)Anurag kashyap: Yes

Ye trailer hai ya behind the scenes

The movie was pretty good. Especially when Anil kapoor gets frustrated and angry during the second half of the film.. It seems real then. Anurag ji toh hmesha hi sadist lgte hi h. Haha. Love both of them. Worth a watch 4/5

This was an experimental film ,why the f**k audience wont understand. people are just busy in coolie no.1 even through they call it worst they watch it .it has more IMDb rating than this one ,please watch this , dont waste your time

Netflix people don't get any more
To wo Twitter wali ladayi ka kya hua??shukr h nakli fight thi, main to abhi tak apna side bhi decide ni kr paya tha ki kisko support karuTough Choice

Anil Kapoor's Last Try, Sonam &amp; Keeping Harsh with me also showed me that this is how I act, now you will learn it
<a href="">1:37</a> Ye Acting Nahi Ha..............
Ak vs Ak is there will be sequel

this bit is different
Disliking it just because of cheap tactics used by both of them to publicise it.

What is this?
Notanki sala

Abe buddhe bus kar ab torture

Hey brother, finally show me what you want‍️
It&#39;s a good one time watch 
I watched this movieUnbelievable end

i could see Boney Kapoor here! Saaar valimai update saar?
Lawde ka Script

Sonam Gupta is unfaithful and Sonam Kapoor is missing 
Plot reminds me of Table no. 21

Phely Sonam Gupta Bewafa huiAb Uski Bari Sister Sonam Kapoor Lapataa.
Fact that people getting confused by watching this trailer is the reason why people will watch it

Why Air Force uniform is involved in it ? 

Let's talk about Maze that Sonam Kapoor came on Twitter on 21st this is incredible, she wrote congratulations, even Anurag Kashyap was not able to touch her phone and when she was kidnapped, she was 
the iaf uniform is shown in a  disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic movie.

The indian air force uniform was shown in a disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic flop  movie.

The indian air force uniform was shown in a disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic flop  movie.

Just Watched The Movie!Still Imma Say AK Is Phenomenal!Now Keep Guessing 

Who will tell me what is this?
M*<b>***</b> What is the need to wear Air Force uniform, if you can't respect it then don't mind friend, you don't get Air Force uniform just like that 
&quot;hyla mhantat acting&quot;.......that was awsome :D

Sonam kapoor while watching the trailer- who kidnapped me baby when we are in paris?

Bakwas movie

Watched it now . Flawless .

Another BAKWAAS..... 
Air Force's uniform is a joke and people wear it infamously.
This is called  soft influencingRepresenting uniform like jokers  ISI ke pillo sahi paise le rhe ho pkxtan walo se

Just watched the movie. The best part of the movie is sonam had no dialogue &amp; people have to tolerate her for just few seconds. Not in whole movie.

Jhakas bidu

It&#39;s called content

Ak Vs Ak very good movie saw it today morning.. entertaining Ak and aks performance brilliant and specially in the climax....something different but engaging 

Extraordinary thinking ️

What bawaseer have you made?
This is what happens when you&#39;re trying to copy Borat.

Insult of IAF uniform  in this movies

Why is he wearing the uniform of Indian airforce&#39;s pilot??

Table no 21
Netflix is becoming whorst Ott platform

Indeed only Anil Kapoor can save Sonam Kapoor in the industry ;)

Wat a concept man
Anurag ki movie chalna Band hogyi h toh nautaki chalu kardiya h

<b>Ek No Movie Bole to jhakaasssss Maaza Aa Gaya Yaar</b>
Seriously!??? Matlab kuchh bhi!!!!!
Saal khatam hote hote sonam kapoor bhi kidnap ho gayi  iss saal kuch toh acha hona tha

Sonam Gupta Bewafa hai Sonam Kapoor Laapta Hai. Yhi mil rha ab Netflix ko . I am surprised that Anurag, being such a great director, is wasting his time with Anil.

Trust me this is going to be way better than Coolie No. 1

Anil kapoor:s acting in this movie outstanding

Single camera shots5 5 minutes long single shot
Kamaal movie he boss
Bollywood aur kitna bullshit banoge...wahi kapoor wahi khan...its so rotten
I am watching the movie I am so confuse‍️ still 30 minutes left look so real

super BAKWAAAAS.
What a movie ️️
BRILLIANT MOVIE ! :D loved it to bits.

The number of times Harsh says &quot;Fucking&quot; in his dialogue pretty much sums up his fucked up career. 2 mins of fuckin limelight to fucking no where

These bastards again messed up with the iaf. Now nobody literally nobody but I’ll make sure as an iaf officers daughter and a spouse, he pays for this. People sacrifice, get trained , proves themselves and then they earn the prestigious uniform .

Anurag: The script is like this… I have kidnapped Sonam… You have to fuck me in 10 hours… Anil: Open your mouth (gutter) in 2 hours… You will fuck me yourself.
Flopped

Ye trailer hai pr dekh kr lag raha hai &quot;behind the scene&quot; ya &quot;making of the film&quot; video hai

Its Called extra ordinary thinking by the director or writer, Total reality feelings. Awesome.

what is this
For those few who still think this is real - &quot;ghanta real hai ye&quot;.

This is really something new.

Bekar h

Marketing was top-notch but their service=SHIT, the movie not yet released. I completed all my work and was eager to watch this tonight...and highly disappointed.

The movie is not released yet why so?

Kuch bhi hootiyapa ko produced kroge @NetflixIndia
Director of wassepur in the house 

No Sonam Kapoor was not harmed in making but sentiments of Armed personnels were. But why think. They are meant to die. Good job India. 

Got Surprise by hearing that  this film was make in seven years.

Why do they say 24th December release ...when it is not releasing on 24th ...fuckers.,.

I am happy that sonam kapoor is kidnapped bcuz no one wants her bcuz she one of the dumb nd talent less starkid

This was a also a marketing gimmick.... Saying it will release today but did not released... It created more eagerness in the minds of the people as to why it was not released... Eventually leading to more marketing of the film...

Ma*<b>*****c*****</b> movie Where is it
In this also the Indian Air Force is wrongly represented and in the movie we also represent the Army wrongly
Ek baar ke liye to ye sab asli hi lagne laga tha

Why is it not released yet?

Scripted
Why is it not released yet?

&#39;&#39;Taken&#39;: movie ka charba hain Yee....

Nai Sir acting lag he nai rhi h, Super hit h

At one time it felt as if it was not a movie, the real recording was going on.
The movie is quite similar to a franch Dark movie called Irreversible....

ohh!  so this is the base of whole of the diss track on anil, and joking with movies of anurag

Why does it look like copy of 24 series in which Anil Kapoor was lead?

I&#39;m all in ...said ak

I think&quot; d &quot; told&quot; ak&quot;  To disrespect IAF uniform.Samaj rahe ho ?

Please don&#39;t disrespect the Indian armed forces by using their uniforms according to you controversies I best way to attract the public attention because nowadays you are not getting views

Aha... Nice new concept

What a bawasir you have created..
I think this film is being made to finance Anurag Kashyap's next film. I am very fond of this

Is suchitra tyagi from film companion in this movie because she listed on the cast in the Wikipedia page

I think AK must be playing IAF Officer in a movie &amp; when on location his daughter gets kidnapped. That&#39;s why he is in IAF dress.

Saala yala mhantaat acting.Ye acting nahi hai.Nahi sir acting lag hi nahi rahi.

Filling relax after dumb Kapoor kidnap

I guess India is the only country that can run saas bahu serial even in netflix..why even waste time watching these bogus shows..can&#39;t env make a decent series like the Hollywood does

Instead of AK vs AK, this movie feels more like &quot;Kapoor &amp; Family&quot;

I wil be really happy agar sonam Kapoor is movie ke infinite part tak kidnapped he rahe..

the budget of the film is same as Sonam Kapoor struggle

Producer money been saved. Big thanks to sonam kapoor.

Omg, y’all are so mean. Like I understand if you guys don’t like her, but please don’t hate on others. Just ignore

Anurag sir.. Good..Anil sir good. But tech her how to act like you sir...

Report that IAF uniform is being disrespected
Karma follows everywhere.. What he did Jamal few years back for being honest and he sent jamal to jail. slumdog millionaire. Now he himself come to police station for being not acting. simple

remake of mollywood velithirai movie

Chutya movie
Yaa have kept IAF's uniform as a symbol of society, yaa bollywood walo na  mothrchod bollywood.
LOCKDOWN( covid -19) has increased value of web seriesHit LIKE  if u agree

Very experimental . Can&#39;t wait for it.

<i>bawasir</i>

That bastard is praising our Indian Air Force.
It&#39;s good that sonam kapoor ko Nahi bola ki tum Anil kapoor ko dhundho

Yai sala ho kya rha hai,Only ON NUTFLIX 

Sab kuchh thik tha, but airforce uniform ka seen hai

Congratulation Netflix 10M Subscribe 
Climax:- SooNam nhi mili, everyone stayed happily after

Mother sonam kapoor ko please kalyug ka sabse bada punaya lorogi
Very good

Plz band all this sed

Plot Twist:- AK was acting

Divine

Aap hasenge toh bhi...Pause was mind blowing and then koi outsider involve nahin hoga

Anurag kashyap &#39;&#39;sonam ko kidnap kar liya gya hai&quot;Me in my mind &quot;thank god she is not in the movie&quot;

This is the first time ever that Sonam Kapoor&#39;s struggles are real.

What's the joke of Anil Kapoor making high-rise movies wearing air force uniforms without making him skate?
Wat stupidity is this.. meaningless contents from these established professionals..

Everything was jhakass until they said &quot;sonam&quot;     ) :

Anurag kashyap has ruined his career joining mainstream bollywood artist.  He no longer interests me

BS

Ban ban ban ban
Maha Bawaseer. If there will be a flop then say Indian audience is not ready yet. Amazing pussy
So basically, Anil Kapoor is Indian Liam Neeson! Wow, Bollywood “Taken”



Let&#39;s see if this movie says based on true events...

Bai trailer g**d faad hai agar movie dangerous hui toh pakka aagg laga degi ye
What are you?
Who gave them the permission to call us?
What a overacting 

This is not less than a big&quot; Hemorrhoids&quot; , flop hoga to bolega abhi indian audience is not ready for it.Ajab Chutiyapa Hai
This just looks faadu !

Piece of Junk.

Kuch bhe chutyapa

 Ye kya tha bhai..

R u people so stupid to understand that u r actually demeaning the uniform of one of the toughest airforce in the world.....does any of ur team members or Anil Kapoor even has the standard of cracking an Airforce exam.I seriously doubt....paise ke liye apne ma behen ko bhi bech to tum NETFLIX!!!

Ahhh Man!! This film industry has taken the armed forces for granted.Here it&#39;s clearly visible that Anil Kapoor is wearing an untucked shirt with all those batches on, which is absolutely a disrespect for our bravehearts serving in The Indian Air Force.And after watching the trailer I didn&#39;t get the point behind he wearing the uniform for saving  his daughterI seriously am a big fan Anurag Kashyap but this thing is not right.Netflix should definitely take some serious against this.

Nahi dekhunga, kill Sonam Kapoor.
Anil kappor u r a great actor we want to see u in good movies like u uses to do like virasat, Black and white, Pukar..ye sab na kro aap yrr

Netflix is only hope  amid the environment created by ridiculous hindi tv serials.



This is new concept by netflix

Bollywood's mother's pussy Anil Kapoor's mother's pussy
Aye sonam kapoor ko mtt dhundoo yrrr ....usko band hi rehne do warna faltu ki shopping or bol bachchan karegi....
