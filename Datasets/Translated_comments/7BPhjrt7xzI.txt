<a href="">#NetflixIndia</a>,  it should be swum not swam.

Why the name has two masaba

Neena gupta is a kinda mother every daughter wud wish to have.

Warning : wear a mask before scrolling down the comments... Avoid the people who laughed so hard till they started coughing n were put in an isolation,,,

Already saw the series!!! It’s amazing!!! When is part 2 coming?   Such a breath of fresh air. Loved it. Me and my daughter ( she is 30 yrs old ) binge watched it together 

Neena Gupta is sooo effing cool

They are quite unique.

This series would have been a hit had it been about Neena Gupta... She is so full of spunk... And really lives up to the phrase that &quot;age is just a number&quot;!! Bring out a series called Neena Neena and see its popularity and your bank balance roaring and soaring!! Hello <a href="">#Netflix</a> are you listening?

I loved Masaba’s acting!! She is so beautiful too

Same questions were asked by mostly sane on her interview with tamana

I love this maa beti ki jodi. They r so cool... Specially Neenaji  and she has raised an amazing daughter just like herself.

Netflix very smartly promoting two shows in one video 

<b>That</b> <b>random</b> <b>person,,,&quot;who</b> <b>liked</b>  <b>my</b> <b>comments&quot;I pray</b>  <b>may</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>live</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>100</b> <b>years</b> ️️
What&#39;s the name of the bg musics?

Season 1 was good, watched this in a day

NEENA THE BRAVEST FEMININE IN THE UNIVERSE 
Okay masaba is really hot and neena ji is obviously savage.
