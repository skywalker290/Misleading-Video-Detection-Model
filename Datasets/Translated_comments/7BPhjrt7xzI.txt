Warning : wear a mask before scrolling down the comments... Avoid the people who laughed so hard till they started coughing n were put in an isolation,,,

Already saw the series!!! It’s amazing!!! When is part 2 coming?   Such a breath of fresh air. Loved it. Me and my daughter ( she is 30 yrs old ) binge watched it together 👍🏼👍🏼

Neena Gupta is sooo effing cool

They are quite unique.😶

This series would have been a hit had it been about Neena Gupta... She is so full of spunk... And really lives up to the phrase that &quot;age is just a number&quot;!! Bring out a series called Neena Neena and see its popularity and your bank balance roaring and soaring!! Hello <a href="">#Netflix</a> are you listening?

I loved Masaba’s acting!! She is so beautiful too

Same questions were asked by mostly sane on her interview with tamana

I love this maa beti ki jodi. They r so cool... Specially Neenaji 😃 and she has raised an amazing daughter just like herself.

Netflix very smartly promoting two shows in one video 😂

<b>That</b> <b>random</b> <b>person,,,&quot;who</b> <b>liked</b> 😭😭 <b>my</b> <b>comments&quot;🙏I pray</b>  <b>may</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>live</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>100</b> <b>years</b> ❤️❤️🧡
What&#39;s the name of the bg musics?

Season 1 was good, watched this in a day

Wow Neena Ji is amazing!! She needs her own reality show! 🤩🙌

NEENA THE BRAVEST FEMININE IN THE UNIVERSE 💐
Okay masaba is really hot and neena ji is obviously savage.

Why black color has been used for the negative answers card while white has been used for the positive answers card? @Netflix
