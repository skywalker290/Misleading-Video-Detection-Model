bro.. thasts so sad its cool to se felix being a literal redstone engenering genius but.. MAN whyd he do that to ikea tower :(

i know this is years old but i just realized he used sound clips from Banjo &amp; Kazooie for Feigi and Matilda lmao

Where is ulla britta

ikea tower was like father to me

It was a f building but it was the most beautiful one

You will be missed.Ikea spaceship

I didn’t know that he could sing that well

Bro is looking at his Swedish land while playing one of the most American songs 

honestly, i always prefered the old ikea tower.. it&#39;s just prettier

This must be how the Ancients felt when they sent off the Destiny...

<a href="">11:42</a> why did I actually get emotional

We will all miss ikea tower

This has been an epic journey, goodbye you beautiful structure.o7

We are back in it. Beetroot has been destroyed, everyone is still alive. This is great

how did your pets survuve

i love how he keeps a missing texture block in his house

Whatching in 2023 and this series still are great

Pewdiepie singing Richard Marx is the funniest thing ever

Miss u

This Minecraft series is better than other Netflix series

So we are gonna ignore the fact that all his pets died in the end of the last episode

Jesus loves you

2

Ok, did anyone notice the untextured block at <a href="">1:47</a>?

its enough to make a man cry:

<a href="">11:59</a> actly good kinda :DDD

am i seriostly crying over a minecraft tower?

Wow cake latter is cool and nice chicken house <a href="">11:00</a> NO

TOOTY VOICE

KAZOOIE VOICE

the banjo kazooie voices were an unexpected epic moment :D

it definitely does not feel like its been 3 years

Bruh towards the end why you playing America the Beautiful?! 

how does pewds have the honey blocks, im just noticing this now

Back for my annual rewatch of the series, its crazy to think its been almost 3 years

That was actually incredibly impressive. And strangely emotional.Goodbye OG Ikea Tower!

he definetly use creator mode to build the rocket ikea towerwhere did he get the honey

Pewds: sends ikea tower to space Me: <b>how the hell did u do that</b>

But isaac #10 or whatever his name was is still there



it&#39;s nice to see pewds use his horse even after getting an elytra, he loves him so much.

Calm down everybody!! I think he just Liked made a copy of the world!!

I opened minecraft world after a week and Now I have A Chest full of eggs

IKEA tower was like father to me

I&#39;m gonna cry

Holy! Frick lore.

Are you using Banjo and Kazooie voices for feigi and his girlfriend?

What an impressive bye bye to Ikea Tower. He will live forever in space, the final frontier and explore strange new worlds. He will boldly go where no Ikea Tower has gone before.

I rewatched this vid and it makes me sad for a reason

I never thought I&#39;d cry over a tower

Yea not gonna lie but the tower you made earlier looked wayyy better

<a href="">11:03</a> why do I feel bad about a pile of blocks

goodbye... Ikea Tower  I can&#39;t belive he did it . IKEA FOREVER

Good by IKEA tower

Who else low key really loved when he sang 

he use chets he has no hony and now he has cap

The banjo Kazooie sounds. Fire.

This fully grown man singing that song as his IKEA tower launched into space killed me off  He deserves his 111,000,000 subscribers

can&#39;t believe he launched Ikea tower into space lol

this is the romance of a man

Neil Armstrong: We are just entering spaceWait is that IKEA Tower&quot;

rip ikea tower

Feelix you have villager and villager trades cake 

Why is there a block with a missing texture Felix?

BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ANIMALS THEY BLOW UP!!

We gonna ignore the fact that jeorgen could’ve used the normal stairs?

goddamn.. pewds knows how to make you sad even by sending a building to the space

Why the fuck and I emotional over a tower

Old ikea tower is probably not so far cause of building height

Where ever you go, what ever you doo ♫

I cried about a tower being sent off to space…

HAHAHAHA felix singing is just so iconic HAHAHAHAHAHA

What happened in last episode!

I love How he could have just ridden joergen up the normal stairs but he chooses to spend hours making a cake ladder lol

Im not crying… you are!

PewDiePie: “you want to be lord lord of the chicken?” Feigi: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!

Does PewDiePie ever leave a description?

 bye bye

I like how you just forgotten the last episode

A sad tower never forget that

Fergie

How does he make it so sad every time a fictional character leaves and why am I actually attached?

How in the Criss Cross Apple Sauce beetroot eating water sheep did this guy actually manage to sent an entire skyscraper into space?! I thought he was joking about it like when &quot;Jeorgen&quot; pushed the lever until I saw it actually happening. He&#39;s obliviously hacking but I can&#39;t believe he actually did this in Minecraft!

I love how all of us are sad because a MINECRAFT BUILDING is being sent to space

The old IKEA Tower looks different at the End

Who else heard &quot;cake bladder cake bladder cake bladder&quot;

The chicken monarch? Lol

Jesus Christ I can barely make a redstone clock after playing Minecraft for a year and this man who just returned to Minecraft is sending building to space. Lesson learned: I suck at redstone

Ikea tower

Houston we have a problem, it seems like there is an IKEA tower in our way

RIP IKEA tower ;(

Such an anime moment I teared up when ikea tower was gone:(

This man has lost his brain from minecraft

o7 ikea tower

i clicked this video so i can see the god

Last episode: <b>BEETROOT BLOWS UP IKEA TOWERRRR</b>Next episode: cake ladder! :&gt;

how to push ikea tower like that

Ngl I kinda teared up watching this

Not sure if anyone else has notice or appreciates it but I love how you are using the Banjo-Kazooie/Banjo-Tooie character voice sounds as your Minecraft character voices. It’s hilarious and nostalgic.

our <b>GOD</b> is real in <b>real life</b> :)

Rewatching this 2 years later, and I’m just like “what the frick are the nosises that the animals and creepers make”

<a href="">12:11</a> I think he cutted the video because he is crying

The title 

Don’t get rid of ikea tower (old)

I Promised Myself I Wouldn&#39;t Cry.

Ikea tower being send to space, that&#39;s the saddest thing ever 

You trolled me in before episode, now I hate you 

Ikea rocket

HOW TF DID THE CAKE LADDER ACTUALLY WORK I&#39;M SHOOK

Everyone: Talking about Ikea Tower going to spaceMe wondering how Felix got Honey Blocks:

In an altern universe:Watersheep: * doesnt exist*Pewds: We finally beat the enderdragon!! - minecraft pt. 4

Goodbye Ikea Tower

What a way to end an episode

I cant believe I&#39;m crying over a minecraft build getting sent off to space

What happened to him blowing up Sven and the others?

As soon he said “the new IKEA tower is glorious” an ad then came on and immediately said “that’s ridiculous”. 

Felix: Sven, why does IKEA Tower have to go?Sven: *Eternal scream*.

Wait... how is sven in this video? didn&#39;t he die in the last episode?

?

<a href="">10:37</a>

I thought sven dies

Wait a minute… where all the honey blocks that Felix use to send ikea tower to space

GOOOD

wwwwwywwwwwwwywwwwy

How’d u get honeycomb block

Im sheding tears

Im crying right now

YEEeEeeEeEeEes SVEN Is BacK!!!

Felix, I am so sorry. In the last fireworks video I said you were copying Uberhaxornova by making fireworks just like him, except inferior. I was wrong, and this episode proves it. James could never build as cool of a firework as this, and he never did. The ball is clearly in his side of the hockey rink. Any move he makes now is just him trying to top you or copy you. Sorry again, and hopefully you are having a good day. Many blessings to you and your family from all of us. ‍️‍️

the first scene is actually at <a href="">8:26</a>

Using the &quot;voices&quot; from banjo-kazooie: beautiful

Y could you just make stairs

its kinda sad cuz the ikea tower

I made eggs while watching this

it went from sad violin noises to &quot;nani?! you havent played pewdiepie pixelings yet?&quot;

I actually fucking cried...

Legends say that Ikea Tower is still flying until this day

Omg I&#39;m so stuped I litterly just realized sven was gay... 

Okay hear me out… COUNCIL OF CHICKENNN

Me: crying about ikea tower being gone. Pewds: ‘swedish noises’ Pixelings!

Not me crying over IKEA tower going into space

Why would you need to prove if god is real if he already blessed us with this series

Its so sad that ikea tower is leaving

good bye ikea tower

Well, looks like ikea tower will be in a safe place, a better place, with feigi, jeorgen, jeorgen the second, water sheep, bernie, and pee pee poo poo, they will all be watching pewds from up there, they will always be remembered....

im crying for an object

You made anti Christ Church

Mr Elon Musk over here....sending shit to space for no reason

Ikea tower, from sea to shining sea...

Damn Felix u r really a gud singer...  Not joking

me: wait, coudnt joergen have gone up the stairs and felix just dig a pathway in the hill?felix: nah fam

I thought that Sven Jorgen died in the last episode

Did anyone notice at <a href="">1:48</a> that there is a error block. Would that be because of the texture pack or?

I like how he made feigi have kazooies voice

feigi

Let&#39;s all take a moment for Ikea Tower even if it&#39;s been a while...IKEA Tower represents the goodness of the past, and the New IKEA Tower represents the greatness of the future...

How have you done to make Ikea Tower fly ? This is amazing (and sad) !

this is boring

This must have costume a lot of iron

Can we all just take a momment to realize how good Felix is at singing?

I love how every comment starts with I love how.

FEEEELLLLIIIIIIXXX!

Horses don&#39;t take fall damage tho

Ik im taking this way to far but wheteverTheory that pewds got so badly hurt in the explosion, all his pets died so he made up this episode (and the rest) in his head to cope

Does anyone notice nathinal anchel music

lmao in one of my and my friend&#39;s games on his ps3, I made a ton of cakes and put them all over the house, especially in the middle of halls and doorways, in every corner, on top of any crfting table or wall nook, and floating in place. Some of them obviously would be blocking his path so he had to eat his way through them. Then he&#39;d come up behind me while I&#39;m making more and be like &quot;you better not be making more cakes!&quot;

Omg

I cried over a tower :) great 

I watch a full brown man talk to his imagunary sog and a freekin tower for 13 Minutes and its worth it

Was it just me or did you lowkey cry

No

Bye bye IKEA tower

How did he get the honeyblocks from the rocket?

I guess you can now call it skykea tower now haha

I love that it is banjo kasoozoi sounds!

Hwo is Felix?

IKEA tower is probably still going up to the stars today

Phew scen lived in the other  one

NASA hire this man right now he sent a giant fucking tower to space

i never know he was good at singing

Couldt Jörigen just have walked up the stairs

At this point he&#39;s just professional shitposting

At least feigi isn&#39;t a virgin anymore 

... ok

The death of the council of beatroot was a death we were waiting forAnd ItFelt Good

Cool and defiantly not fake fact is that cakes are made out of redstone not cherries and the icing is quarts and the actual cake is dirt

Why does h have the star spangled banner playing in the background

Wait a second isn&#39;t there a barrier that tells you how high blocks can go that means he broke the barrier that&#39;s some undertale right there in Minecraft what the heck

Remember this song. It&#39;s a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake. what!( you guys do the rest)

Elon musk: were going to mars in 2024!When they build a base on Mars: how about we repair that crashed IKEA tower and put it just over there

why is a tower being launched into space so sad?

9 out of 5 dentists approve cake ladder.

This was the first Pewdiepie vid I ever saw. Currently rewatching the series with my bros. Ah, the memories.

Did he use honey blocks?

I just realised the day this video was published I was broken up with but I&#39;m over now and I have no regrets.  idk just thought I&#39;d point it out. Anyway hello random person reading this, have a nice life and may the Youtube algorithm bring us back together one day :)

By the way quote of the day: “bye bye IKEA Tower”

I’m really sad but I’m also really impressed by the Redstone engineering

Mom: Why are you crying?Me: <b>Between tears</b> I-I-IKEA Tower is goneMom: <b>Visible confusion</b>

He should have played Last Train Home when he was sending off Ikea Tower.

I

i don&#39;t no why it was so sad to see ikea tower get launched into space

When he tried to build to the build high and see ikea tower

How did joergen,Sven,Sven&#39;sBF and being come back to life

IKEA tower was like father to me.

wHeReVeR yOu gO

Did he just yeet up the fucking building-

R.I.P old kea tower

PEWDS: I loved him like a father, I loved him like a lover...ME: Wait... What...!?!

Who felt really bad when he launched the tower

Thumbnail is freaking awesome

There is a hight limit so ikea tower is probably still in there constantly hitting the ceiling in agony.

This episode was in top 10 saddest anime deathsI really was going to cry

So saaaaaaaadddddd

I wonder if he could make a building with pistons under it making it bounce up continously...then you&#39;ll have a bouncing building...maybe like out of wool...or even better put slime in it and make a friggin insane bouncy house thing 

Banjo kazooie voices

It is weird that all of his pets died in the previous episode and now they are alive... I think Felix just backup the world before his pets died.

Seeing ikea tower go makes me more sad than korean dramas

So we’re gonna ignore the fact that America the beautiful is playing in the background

Wow PewDiePie is actually a good singer

pewdiepie: gets a divorcealso pewdiepie: okpewdiepie: send ikea tower to space also pewdiepie: why why did it have to come to this

Am rewatching it and crying about Ikea tower.

Didn’t they blow up last episode
