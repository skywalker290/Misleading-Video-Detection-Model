Was Thor a human here or was he a regular Asgardian? I don&#39;t think Odin could turn Asgardians into humans

There are so many DUTCH ANGLES

padme’s ex boyfriend was stronger 😒

kinda same as x men days of future past

Never realized that the scientist guy was Boris from Chernobyl

White ppl wanna be the black ppl so badWhite ppl have nothing toThey just a copycat of a black men 😂😂

TOHR BACK POWER VS EIVL THE DESTROYER

TOHR MOVIE 2011

thorxxx<a href="">
I remember liking the Thor movie a lot...but this scene kinda sucks.  If Thor is dead, how does he stick his hand up to grab the hammer before it reaches him?  How does twirling a blunt-headed hammer over his head let him make a tornado?  (Remember, as presented before Thor Ragnarok, Asgardian &quot;magic&quot; is nothing but extremely advanced science, so aside from standard superhero handwaves about giant insects and indestructible costumes, stuff like that, we should be critical of any significant plot point that claims to be scientificially possible but obviously doesn&#39;t work the way it should.)    I think they were too interested in getting a fairly stock Hollywood moment of the Jesus-esque hero&#39;s journey being darkest before the dawn, and it feels really forced here.  If I was either Odin or Mjolnir, I doubt I would pronounce this version of Thor worthy, based on him simply telling the Destroyer to kill him first before continuing its rampage unimpeded.

Bro flew so high

he went for the head

Vader and thor….Natalie’s racking up quite a list lol

How I fell getting hit in the head with a fuckin ice pick and everyone thinks it&#39;s a fuckin joke. Ain&#39;t no joke when you have to live with it.

Jane&#39;s reaction omg😄👌
I actually like how Eric see it flying and knows right away like bitch gtfo now!

I forgot how good the music was in this movie

I remember when i first watched this. 2 months ago.

Look at your hero, look how he suffered, look how he had to prove himself, it wasnt about being a man, it was about pushing his limits to become a better person and that&#39;s why he was powerful. Power should never come free from gender alone

Brother, this movie is of interest to me, what are you doing please ❤❤❤❤
considering the destroyer is the sole guardian of odin&#39;s treasure run, is very weak

The foolish part of this scene is that Thors friends dont come running to Thor as well as he lay dying.

I hear Natalie Portman has a massive gapper, but I cant confirm.

That movie is from a time when MARVEL made great movies. And now? Disney uses Marvel as a cashcow. Quantity instead of QUALITY!

Natalie Portman open your wormhole

Plot armor be like

Jane was wearing mis minutes shirt

Thor goes from almost dying to surviving
Cool movie
The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours. His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. John 1:1,14 KJVIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,1 John 3:8 KJVHe that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.Isaiah 9:6 KJVFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.John 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and THE WORLD KNEW HIM NOT.John 3:18 KJVHe that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Play it slowmo at <a href="">0:23</a> and look at Jane&#39;s shirt its Miss Minutes!

&amp; we never see thor do this really op tornado move ever again

@<a href="">0:29</a> looks like miss minutes at the TVA for a moment

And people think Ragnarok is the best Thor movie.

She wore a shirt with Miss Minutes in it!!!!

Gee, Thor&#39;s transformation into himself again is just incredible

Growing up, Thor was always my favorite. But he never could beat the Destroyer. He always had to trick him or outsmart him. The movie version of the Destroyer is a wimp. The MCU makes a lot of changes from the original plots.

It was great when thor wasn&#39;t one big walking joke

We need Alaskan Euros, 🎉. October 21, 2023.
And I’m going in, we are…

Just for everyone to know: It seems like Thor's scandal towards her, love of immortality towards mortality.
I will be known and feared as El Negro The Destroyer.

I’ll be called and fear Black Blade The Destroyer !. El Negro Destructor !.

More or less this video is a reflexion of the difference of performance between The Universal Emperor and 1 of the Universal Soldiers.

Even.time out kind of video.🙏.😊 good enjoy buddy.give some time to yourself too.khush raha karo 😊.😳🥺🥹.don&#39;t worry haule haule😊❤😊
Lalli challi😊😂❤
This isn&#39;t a destruction.what can be destroyed isn&#39;t a destroyer.what never ever dies.( chup)😊

The Nurtec ODT ad on this video had a woman that was much easier on the eyes than Lady Gaga.

you copied the movie and said it was a &quot;clip&quot; what is a clip and why didny uo steal it from movie

Love how you can see the hammer breaking sound barries due to its speed.

This is why anakin turned to the dark side.

Back in 2023 to pay respects to Ray Stevens (Baylan Skol from Star Wars Ahsoka).  He is the axe guy of the Warriors 3.

why are the jews in hollywood always make us to try to hate womans?

poor direction and bad acting. from crying goes to a moderate &quot;oh my god&quot;. the other girl is laughing like an idiot. It is very bad to avoid commenting on it.

She could have just said nothing. That would have been far better. I just loved Sif&#39;s reaction. Her eyes and her smile spoke volumes.

Man oh man where are the Sentinels when you need them.

Making a twister to lift up a giant android and not one of the wooden houses got torn apart 🤣

difference between the mcu writers then and now .... the writers back then understood the heroes journey and self sacrifice. now its nothing but OP girl bosses and whiny self indulgence.

They needed more in Love and Thunder

I have the Power!

I can’t tell you how many great movies have been ruined to me because of the stupid love cliche a lot of films do. Jane is a part of the Thor movies I can’t get over, she’s just cringe.

Mjolnir and (arrogant) Thor was a love story

Patrick doyle&#39;s music is so epic underrated !!

This movie is ass

One of the best scenes in all marvel movies......and there are a lot good scenes^^ (sorry for my english, i´m a german 😂)

This version of thor could defeat thanos , with the final epic storm

That is how Thor got his groove back.....Man I miss the old MCU

It was the best thor movie according to me

For your information, the destroyer is not dead. Firelord certainly came to Earth to trade his freedom, bringing the Destroyer&#39;s body to Galactus, who then became a herald of Galactus.

The tear Odin has while asleep after seeing his son do such a selfless act that got him killed just to save a town full of humans was the best part. Odin learned right there that Thor had changed and was worthy as a king and most of all to have his Norse god powers and mjolnir back.

That chick is so annoying and cringe..

In the entirety of the MCU the 2 worst lines are Janes &quot;Oh. My. God&quot; and Pepper Potts &quot;Indeed I am&quot;.  so cringe.

That was crazy mjolnir ❤️

One of the most underrated scenes out of any marvel film in history

Destroyer turned into a velocipede 😅. . In the comics he takes a lot more work. .
Remember when Waititi wasn&#39;t the director of thor? Peppridge farm remembers

Favorite secen❤
Thor be like &#39;I saw this in Dragonball Z once when Goku fought Vegeta that was radical&#39;

I always found funny how this destroyer was presented like some super menace that is capabale of huge destruction and really hard to deal withAnd then he’s basically one-shot lmao

They really ignored Thor’s super heroic theme music forever after, eh

Seriously, how good is Patrick Doyle&#39;s score for this movie? Genius.

thor has been thunderstruck

Meet BG9

The cgi and the hit was terrible in this 1st scene looking at it now

One goodking
This scene is still worthy to give goose bumps to its watcher 😂😂😂😂

Really miss this Thor.

<a href="">0:27</a> bouncing boobs<a href="">0:40</a> terrible acting till the end.

Hummer is main

i&#39;d heard that Thor had a lot of dutch angles, but since i&#39;d never seen the movie i didnt think it would be too bad, then i watched this and ended it with my head a skew, Kenneth Branagh you are one amazing director... but here you went a bit far

<a href="">2:20</a> when Thor grabs the hammer and then his armour appears, is probably one of the top 5 mcu moments, others being captains entrance in Infinity war backing wanda and vision, and also thors entrance in wakanda in infinity war too.But one very underrated scene is <a href="">1:22</a> when Odin in his Odin sleep sheds that tear upon thors death right upto that epic line &quot;whoever is worthy...&quot;, even in Odins comatose type sleep and from such a vast distance,   odins soul still cried out upon his sons death, a death he wud certainly be proud of n 1 id like to  think he was aware of. And then off course thors resurrection .  I mean really, from the death, odins reaction and then thors resurrection,  just sheer brilliant storytelling .

HOW could Disney fumble this bag so hard?!?!

What I don&#39;t understand about this movie is it made it seem like Thor became &quot;human&quot; when being stripped of all his powers. But really his baseline would be Asgardian, which would still be an extremely strong and durable being.

Who else comes back here to remember that this is what Thor is all about. I’m saying this now, who on Earth thought that too much forced humor in some of the most recent MCU movies would be a good idea and success for the storylines? Though not all recent marvel movies have cheesy humor. And obviously when I say most recent mcu movies I mostly mean Thor 4/love and thunder. After phase 3, most of the recent mcu movies are pretty good/great. Shang-Chi, Eternals, Spider-Man No Way Home, and I even like Ant Man 3…

Let&#39;s who is watching this after June 2023

Most underrated MCU movie ever
Thor should have inhabited the Destroyer armor in Rangarok to fight Hela or even Thanos in Avengers Infinity War

Even though I mostly love this scene, I still can&#39;t get over Thor easily dispatching the Destroyer Armor.  In the comics, the Destroyer Armor is among the most powerful weapons in the entire Marvel Universe.  It has given Thor and other major powerhouses a run for their money.  Hell, it even scared the shit out of Galactus at one point.

My marriage is fixed and I will not go to anyone's house
OMG
Agoodking

Man of Steel 2013 Smallville fight...just saying...lol

Damn, almost forgot Thor could actually create tornadoes and manipulate the weather instead of, you know... Only throwing lightning. Like what happened? Did they forget he could do all this stuff? Or they just said he would be too overpowered?

You don&#39;t gain superpowers when you&#39;re hit by lightning. There&#39;s a faint taste of pennies for a few years and you pee blood for a couple weeks. And I didn&#39;t get a magic hammer!

I have the powerrrrrr

Rest in Peace, Ray Stevenson. Let the Valkyries guide you to the Hals of Valhalla, where the brave shall live forever.

guess its a good thing the destroyer decided not to fire him instead of just hitting him, then we wouldn&#39;t have thor anymore haha.  Love plot armor.

<a href="">0:21</a>

Patrick Doyle did a really good job on this soundtrack.

R.I.P. Volstagg

Thor has really gone a long way from being a serious toned hero to kinda sorta being a comedy gag hero. In a way I almost miss Thor being like this.

So...many...dutch....angles...

Where is Hajj Zewis’s family? How is his mobile ringing?

SupermanSuperman hearingSuper healing (all physical,magic)Super breathSuper StrengthSuper Speed (Faster Than light)
Kurse kon hai pagal kutte thor ko sirf strength se hara detaMjolnir ko ek punch se direction change karta

I still get over the fact that this was my first marvel movie i ever watched on the big screen back in 2011. I was 6 when it came out, i didn&#39;t know who thor was until i was 13

It&#39;s was Loki ?

What is the movie name?
Is this a Sentinal?

Love that backhander , that’s a pimp hand 👆🏻

He starts walking away SIKE

Natalie Portman really sucks in this film

I said I would do this as a human. I punked all of u demons as a human :) hahahahahahahhahaha. Now that&#39;s over. Now u see the real me. God is back in town.

What a shitty fight ahaha the happy faces of the extras when he turns into Thor again. What a lame film lol
Scene is so cringe 😂😂😂😂 marvel movies are so stupid

when the hammer came out of the ground and went right to Thor, i knew what was gonna happen..i started shaking and crying...the power of Thor..awesome

best ever, brought me to tears when i saw thor get his armor and power back....thanks chris for making my dream come true

Destroyer: &quot;I will disintegrate you.&quot;Thor: &quot;But not before I turn your head into a canoe. Oooops! It&#39;s already a canoe.&quot;Wyatt Earp: &quot;Stop stealing my best lines.&quot;

I&#39;m mad now because this dweeb was able to create Tornadoes and never once said hey maybe I should probably use this again. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen this movie that I forgot that he could even do it 😂.

I wish Thor would create that tornado more often in fights. So cool

Now THIS is Thor!

I love the part of, &quot;Everyone back up, Thor about to fuck him up&quot;

When the destroyer smacked Thor,the cgi looked bad

Great movie Thor v /Destroyer
So cheez Portman.. yuck..
I wish we could’ve seen Thor summoning a tornado in the later films like he did in the first movie

I love this scene

Every shot really was diagonal in this movie

Tony Stark can defeat that Asgardian Robot. He will struggle but he will win eventually.Thanos can destroy it easily.Hulk would smash it with one attack.Strange would use portal to turn it&#39;s laser back to itself.Scarlet Witch would turn it into dust with a blink of eye.

I love the cheap neck snap sound effect making this crazy expensive movie sound like it was edited with movie maker 2012

<a href="">1:46</a>

Should just be called “THOR KILLS EVERYONE”

And in comes Taika Waititi essentially making a joke of one of the Old Gods..... I know, it&#39;s movies. I would love to see an origin series on Odin and family up to Thor&#39;s reign.

And as he&#39;s walking in triumph from the wreckage and smoke, someone sticks a damn commercial right in the damn way.  Thumbs down!!!!

<a href="">2:20</a> still gives me goosebumps 🔥
Thor is like i got my job back yay

Biggest fan ever 😊
Natalie Portman sexy as hell best scene

Why didn’t we see anymore of thors wind powers in the movies

<a href="">0:22</a> <b>best Thor moment in the franchise</b>

<a href="">3:23</a> Parrying a guardian in botw

I swear this was made after iron man, why’s the cgi so bad

jjj
<a href="">2:20</a> - What if... Jane gets the hammer instead of Thor?? We would have the mighty Thor much earlier than planned

aka Thor gets smacked across the Room, nearly dies, gets his powers back AND THEN fights the Destroyer

Distroyer distroied by mcu

nice!

This looks like a transformer movie

CORN 🌽
Y&#39;all notice miss minutes on Jane&#39;s t-shirt??

I almost had tears in my eyes when Thor got his powers back.

If I do not receive a bag from the light,Im going to show you everything..

I&#39;m tired of playing wit chall niggas.Imma hurt somthin.An organization.A United Body will fall together.

Really don’t get the Portman hate, she did a decent job in this film and the whole credibility of Thor learning humility rested on the Thor/Jane relationship. That “Oh my God” line is a decent little joke about her realising he is indeed a god. I certainly dont hate it.This is one of the top Marvel films for me and it’s the characters that make it work so well..there’s more than enough been said about the fantastic Thor/Loki relationship and only Thanos challenges Loki for best bad guy in the MCU.

The destroyer got destroyed!
Man of Steel: Hold my beer.

I am thankful for better CGI productions these days.

<a href="">0:24</a> miss minute on she&#39;s t-shirt
This movie was 10 times better than the trash called &quot;Love and Thunder&quot;

This Thor is so much better than the newer one. Bring this style back Marvel.

Thor never lost his power. He was just unaware that the power came from himself which is why he can still control the weather ( as seen in his attempt on mjolnr

i like thor

The Destroyer kind of remind me of the Sentinels from X-Men, or at least the designs of both characters are eerily similar.

imagine of jane didnt leave just to get her head smashed in by the hammer

<a href="">0:21</a> that&#39;s some terminator 1 animation level...

Is that Thor juggling in Hurricane Ian?  <a href="">

Destroyer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joker naked Tubelight Torr 😂🤣😆😁
Remember when Thor was still an epic character and not the punchbag for gags he is now? Yeah, those were good times.

How do u deflect a laserbeam to the side lmao He hit it like it was a bullet xd

This is so silly

Good marvel times, powerful no gay Thor

Whats with all the weird shots

Cringe cancer
hat movie?

Thor

this scene prove that mjolnier more OP than stormbreaker, imagine if he summon that tornado and destroy all thanos ship and minion

Bro when Odin shed a tear mjlonir went balistic

Is this where she love him?

Thor should&#39;ve killed Loki for this

TOMAS ♥️💪🍝⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
The part when he gets slapped and Jane starts running is so cringey it&#39;s hilarious. 😂 🤣 He starts dying from one hit and the reaction is so dramatic.

I love this film because it had the best representation of both Thor and Loki, they look and act the most accurately of all the mcu films. We also got to see more of what Asgard life is like.

GAY

The first and ONLY time we see Thor create a storm

Why do we never see Thor create tornados more often
<a href="">0:21</a> what the hell is that lmao looks like stop motion it so bad especially compared to iron man 1 that came before this

Anakin is not gonna be happy when he finds out that padme has been cheating on him

Atleast this kind of Thor should have been in Love and Thunder

That ohh my God scene just spoilt it for me.

The scene when mjorn came back gave me chills.

Dude got backhanded so hard he almost died

Who’d win between the Destroyer and Ultron?

A thunder tornado thor is a true god of thunder

And that power is thor

Thats what I call power

Thor is so strong at the end

<a href="">2:21</a>

They are a lot of things in this movie that people forget. The fact Thor was Serious and was about change instead of crazy rock music or fairytales

I miss when Marvel movies didn&#39;t suck

<a href="">0:19</a> what is that cgi lol

loki deserved a clock to the side of the head as well because I am certain he sent the destroyer

I am thor

This is a really iconic moment

<a href="">0:20</a> destroyer be like: it was just joke guys anyways im gonna leave this place.. SIKE

Loki went for the head so Thor wouldn&#39;t have to

I&#39;ve been looking for that card. 👸🏼Queen of 💞.

Gee, Natalie age quickly as everybody else still looks the same.

Good 👍 Great for Short Clips
Armored giant and respected northeast
You know with the way thor acts now he shouldn&#39;t be worthy he acts the same as now as he did when Odin diddnt deem him worthy and by the mcu logic almost everyone in age of ultron should of been worthy idk maybe its like Odin showed him a lesson and just let him stay worthy if only in endgame cap was like &quot;hey Tony! Hold this real quick&quot; after he snapped

For a being who&#39;s only power was strength and fire breath, The Destroyer came off as super intimidating

<a href=""> href="">

And them taika destroyed all this character development

Soo he can be worthy but getting slapped by some robot dude but iron man can’t get worthy when he jumped into space risking his life

I love Thor&#39;s small smile when his brother&#39;s robor turns away and he thinks that he loves him, then POW!

Gort?

Yo they nerfed Thor

Man, remember when marvel had the slightest bit of emotional depth.

So weird that they had The Destroyer, of all characters, get run over by Thor. In the comics, The Destroyer is as far above Thor in terms of power as Thor is above the average human. He&#39;s Asgard&#39;s ultimate line of defense, essentially unbeatable in battle.

Still the best Thor film!

<a href="">2:20</a> SHAZAM!

My wrinkles are for your wrinkles

Who here doesn&#39;t realize that&#39;s a cheap Cali set?!?!

Only the creator grants power, restores life and knows what is in your heart.

Doyle tried his best.

When the hammer hits the destroyer its like it lagged for a second😆

Movie name please

Damn I forgot how egregious the dutch tilts are in this movie. I keep twisting my head.

As usual, the bad guy mildly wounds the good guy and walks away just long enough for the good guy to get his powers back.

No one is gonna deal with the fact that Mjolnir just sonic boom? This is the best Thor movie in the Thor franchise btw.

The first 2 Thor movies are the only MCU movies I&#39;ve fallen asleep during. I cannot believe that scene was only 4 minutes. They just drag.

Damn we really need this Thor coupled with Stormbreaker.

The weird thing is that this is Thor's weakest form, but we never saw him this strong in later movies.
The terrible Thor never gives up 🥰
My favorite scene in the entire film.

Thor swinging his hammer be like: Helicopter, helicopter

Ew phase 1
&quot;oh you are quite brave, I won&#39;t kill you&quot;....&quot;just joking bitch&quot;

Thor went from being the character that just wanted power and to be feared to being one of the best characters in the MCU

always wondered this but never askedisn&#39;t the destroyer armor supposed to be hella OP?

2011: Thor rise again with Mjolnir, Jane: &quot;Oh....my....God&quot;2022: Jane become Thor and lift Mjolnir, Thor &quot;Janeeee????&quot;

<a href="">0:20</a> man said sike

Thor old spice commercial before this

I would have liked to think that for just once my father sheds a single tear for me. Only one. He never did that even when I was in the hospital. Never.

Are we ignoring how fatidically horrendous the CGI is at this specific part? <a href="">0:19</a>

How they ever thought that Thor love and Thunder would beat this is beyond me. This is the true Thor that fans like and will always be a fan of

This is what Thor is supposed to be. Taika turned him into a clown. Although Chris Hemsworth’s comedic timing is impeccable and he is entertaining as comic Thor, that is not the direction I like for Thor.

What have odin done?

<a href="">2:51</a> is it just me, or does thor kinda look like jesus in this shot?

<a href="">2:20</a> - The best moment in the entire film!

bullshit

finally worthy
It&#39;s so much weird that thor&#39;s friend were Just stood by and watch the drama. Didn’t even stop jane, Didn&#39;t even take her away while mjnior was coming. They were acting like a typical indian drama character

<a href="">1:46</a> Whosoever holds this hammer…..If he be worthy……..Shall possesses the power of THOR

Back when Thor was Thor

Lazy film making at its best.

Thor in here so lol

Lmao vfx man Btw love marvel

<a href="">0:09</a> So weird to see the original scene without the pop-corn montage

never let anyone trick yoyr mind into something that your clearly able to do no1

&lt;/&gt;

This is still the best Thor movie btw

I love how half assed this movie is

Bring back this Thor

Cgi looked like garbage

One simple fight scene is much better than Thor: Love and Trash.

In this Thor was manly , courageous, charismatic, passionate and mainly A God. Not some weak ass pussy joker dumbass like in thor 4

I thought I saw a triquetra on Thor&#39;s hammer...

Otter bilge
Idc what anyone says, this movie’s MUCH better than ragnarok, at least it actually feels like a thor story that doesn’t turn a badass tragic god into a comedian

Who watched this crap...
I always hated how stiff and fake this character looked <a href="">0:22</a> I mean look at that CG it’s awful

When the destroyer hits thor for the first time it was so funny the cgi looked so janky

This film has best ending fight and song than a others marvel movies like captain marvel, antman, spiderman homecoming, iron man 3 , blackpanter...

when you try try just as hard to suceed in life

like a vet  treated likd shit after it won!!!

I'D RATHER SEE ALITA...

When Christian sacrifice meets Norse mythology

Destroyer gave me literal Chill&#39;s when i first saw it. I was 9

This is what Thor is meant to be. A arrogant hero humbled by his actions and life among mortals. A strong badass that you can take seriously. Unfortunately recent Thor films turn him into a silly juvenile jokester who doesn’t act anything like the matured Thor in the early films. Additionally the music was so much better in this compared to any other Thor film.

I cant wait for love and thunder when they reunite

The Destroyer reminds me of The Sentinels

Banan Alice: Ur music sucks :D Me: <a href="">0:22</a> :D
“It’s over.”“It’s not over.”“You’re safe?”“I’m safe.”“Then it’s over.”Goddamn what a great moment

Every few months I watch this scene and each of those times, I feel chills go down my spine when the hammer reaches Thor&#39;s hand and his heroic theme plays. Just perfect.

Why do they use underage kids?

Oh, so this is where Tyrone Magnus got that one music track from

Thor (2011)CineLine ClipsTime Lives (81:00)

Beautiful scene

I like how the Marvel What If… Thor is basically this version taken to frat boy extreme.

So that&#39;s what it does.

The occupying thieves are the most violent and meanest people of God and the English is very motherly, a thief and a dirty bastard, then he is a creditor for his whole life, taking people with oil, then take an egg from the store, he says pay for it, we don't have anything for free, you have to speak English, I don't have money You're a motherfucker, I mean, I'm shameless, I'll clean your mouth, what are you talking about, say English, the world language, yes, with the oil of the Mufti of Pars What are you doing? You have made the whole world miserable. May God answer you. I have overstepped my right. At least don't kill people, sick animals.
I always thought that destroyer was awfully similar to the mutant killing robots from Xmen...

This shows how powerful Thor and strong he was. Some idiots still thinks that Thor is a weakling.

This whole scene is cringe asf

he always find father

Everyone: “ThOr Is ThE sTrOnGeSt AvEnGeR”Also Thor: gets bitch slapped and almost dies from it

Mm🐂🐘🐘🐘🐂🐂🐂🐘🐘🐘🐘🐂🐂🐘🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐘🐘🐂🐂🐂🐘🐘🐘🐂🐘🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂💩💩🐂🐂🐂🐂
Purely for Torah I give a like
Say whatever you want, but this scene, it&#39;s top 10 for most badass scene in MCU.

Imagin that thing falling on them killing them

Huracane easily picks up The Destroyer and people are just standing like nothing is happen

on
I miss Thor&#39;s crew

the zooms on the side characters&#39; faces is so fucking awkward oh my god.

Stand Thor 100 hammers kill george ramirez

What a loser. Without hammer, he is a wimp

Most nonsense movie scene I have ever seen.

Thank you
God of Mischief: <b>gets tricked</b>God of Thunder <b>gets zapped</b>Destroyer: <b>gets destroyed</b>Goddess of death: <b>dies</b>

Good job, Jonathan

that&#39;s a fuckin hammer...

She had that same affect on Anakin

He’s thor. God of bleached eyebrows.  So glad they made them darker in the next movie.  It looked like he shaved them up.  Reminded me of my little sister when she used to as a teenager.  Couldn’t stop laughing

This scene is so epic. Gives me goosebumps everytime

Why didn’t Steve armor up when he took up the hammer?  If he had the full power of Thor…

After watching Love and thunder trailer, I&#39;m not surprised if Natalie catch Mjolnir.

Rip Destroyer

Is that Rodolfo Hernández slapping the person who denounced him for being corrupt?
<a href="">

One of my favourite movie scenes

And after this they proceeded to nerf and make Thor into a comic relief.

The destroyer the first stan lee create?

Damn thor took him out with no sweat, strongest avenger

Woah, I am so amazed by the structural integrity of the buildings around the area. Withstanding the cyclone made by thor HAHAGHAAHGA, the architects sure wasnt playing.

Hulk or the destroyer who is strongest

That was a two minute fight lol

Movie name kya h
Technically he stone is worthy because it is lifting it not breaking

Movie name
Totally Gay Acting. The End

Thor got slapped Will Smith style.

This is where the winter soldiers metal arm came from

One of the few times Thor felt like a storm god

Movie name
That cgi smack was terrible lmao

Could&#39;ve killed Thanos...if he just did this. lol. 💯

There is this Thor...and then the Thor in Love and Thunder that Jane Foster is more powerful than Thor and she is somehow worthy of carrying the hammer??? Are you kidding me

All those millions of dollars they used to setup the station, rendered almost useless in couple of seconds. In would have been in the best interests of taxpayers for thor to remain unworthy for longer🤣🤣🤣🤣.

It would feel so cool if the destroyer helped in the infinity war if Asgard didn&#39;t get destroyed

<a href="">0:20</a> when destroyer turned back is unrealistic

I laughed when he got back handed and was punted away

Fairy tale
Jane is the most hated character in the mcu nd these idiots wanna bring her back as thor instead of thor fighting the world serpent

Whoever filmed this needs to replace one of the legs on their tripod

God all those annoying Dutch angles

I don&#39;t care what a single person says otherwise, this was the only time we were entertained by a Thor film while the directors actually took the character seriously. Ragnorok is literally just one big joke, and I miss compelling serious moments like these that don&#39;t feel the need to make a joke out of everything.

Someday in the not-so-distant future, it’s gonna be you suiting up like that, Jane.

If they did The Destroyer comic accurate, they can do the Sentinels comic accurate too

Refreshing.. Thor doing Thor things.  Can&#39;t wait for Bore and Blunder

That&#39;s the <a href="">fact.No</a> one can finish Thor 🤠

Anyone here after seeing the Thor 4 teaser? Nope? Just me, okay :(

I love this film so much.

*Thor creates tornado Metal robot that weights 5billion tons: &quot;WEEEEEE!&quot;Normal house nearby: &quot; Can&#39;t touch this&quot;

Cool plot point. Where was the metal guy during Hela? How about Thanos?

What the fuck, what's the point?
I think they should have saved the destroyer he could have been a good asset in the future series.

Love how he was nearly dying but then he had his power and got him

Thor vs the thing from X-men movie

I'm tired of these Holywoo faces, it's always the same standard faces pffff here Igor d'Hosgord, don't look for Thor!
She was talking about some &quot;No&quot;. Unless you want to get demolished by Mjolnir, you better move 🤦🏾‍♂️

idiots talk to iron
Why did she run like that...

...is... is this like the sentinals from xmen?

It's really cool.
one of the greatest suit up scenes in the MCU😅

the acting/ directing looks so bad now that I am seeing it again after years. Closeup 😲 face zooms 😂😂. But I remember the scene being so cool when I first watched it

I aways find Destroyer&#39;s beam bone chilling

Epic
As an Indian if thor is most powerfull, then Lord shiva has no limit of power 👍👍

They conveniently powered down the Destroyer here, in the comics Odin built it to kill celestials and even before Hella it destroyed Mjolnir and handed an ass whopping to Thor that nobody ever did.

A really fun movie
looks so cheap...
Cinema for freaks
Cap: Put down the hammer, what are you?Thor: God.

It’s a boooool shiiiiit

needed another 15 seconds

I like this one better in the rear. Not a cyclops

Thor is Russia rising from the ashes.

The Destroyer would make a great patio heater ! Just saying 🤔🤪

<a href="">

Imagine accidentally getting knocked out by that flying hammer 😭😭😭😭 🪧💨

So silly this movie.

Natalie Portman is so lame in this. She stands out in a poorly acted mess of a film.

I feel the power of the hammer every time I go pee

lol

He walks away like &quot;I don&#39;t think so Tim&quot;....

Thor beats up a Weber grill.  Genius.

Rest in Physics When all near by object were flying because of that much pressure and intense power doesn&#39;t affect the near by normal human whose there and watching this shitt.😀

Ohmy, I only now noticed ow bad that first Destroyer&#39;s panch was animated

It’s like that giant robot from the day the earth stood still

Everything is spinning around and pulling in cars, and at the end of the building the glass is intact))
<a href="">0:20</a> That CGI movement was so bad xD

looks stupid AF

I don’t understand these Marvel creators, having such power and having such capabilities as controlling the weather, causing a tornado and lightning, and lifting a multi-ton iron monster, in addition to screwing up in the battle with Thanos in AVENGERS FINALE, he was fucked there like a young boy. What prevented him from lifting Thanos to a decent height, covered with a tornado, and from above falling on him with his thunder ax and blowing his head off? Well, of course, then there would be no Avengers FINALE, since all their scripts were written on the knee.
This is a Thor / game of thrones cross over... That mountain gets around for such a big dude

Some kind of nonsense....
don&#39;t f*ck with Thor you woke son of b*tch bastards!

as soon as the robot saw thor was back he knew he was in trouble and immediately sh*t his pants!

Ruining the ending by pasting your ad garbage all over the frame. A$$hole

This has been on my mind for a while. Who would win in a 1 vs 1 fight, The Destroyer or a Sentinel in the X-Men reboot?

clothes just come out of nowhere

I&#39;ll tell you a secret ... it&#39;s fiction

Boy, I’m glad I didn’t see this stinker of a movie

This was better than The batman

.....STRANGE THAT THIS IMMORTAL CAN'T BEAT THANOS......Hmmmmmm....no wonder THANOS EXPECTED DEATH..&quot; IF IT CAN BE CALLED "DEATH"...... OF HELA AND ODIN....... IMPOSSIBLE FOR THANOS TO BEAT THESE BEINGS... IMPOSSIBLE..... VERY SMART THANOS... NOW IT IS EXPLAINED BECAUSE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE TESSERACT WAS ON EARTH AND THANOS NEVER DARE TO COME AND LOOK FOR IT... HE COMMANDED LOKI ALONG WITH THAT ARMY OF INUTULES... BUT HE NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE... Hmmmmm ...NOW EVERYTHING IS CLEAR...THE EARTH WAS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ODIN...

So gay

Such a rewarding moment!

People pay Money to watch his bullshit?

The guy under me is a idiot👇

Thor is based on demonic activity in Earth&#39;s past. Jesus Christ is Lord, put your trust in Him and live forever ❤️✝️🙏

Is his beard dyed and trimmed?

That a stupidest shit I have seen ever.

Thor is the same as Iron Man Episode 1. After watching it for the first time, I felt it had a strong impact!! The Marvel whirlwind will start later!!

I though this  is sentinel from Xmen

<a href="">1:10</a> thats how Heimdal looked like in the comics....not &quot;the destroyer&quot;

Whenever I try to solve the problems of life, I live in the hope that someday my time will definitely come, just as Thor's time has come back, this is a hope for all the lost people, my lost friends, their defeat. Mother, your or my time will also come, or if it does not come then friends, we will drag our time, Jai Jai Shree Raam
I am a leader and owner of a huge fortune and to achieve my goal I will share the cake....they will betray them......The king of Spain told me that if he fought you I would give him people I am not my before that cuutemo. I am John Rambo, a theorist in intelligence and I am an emperor, I control from Mexico to Peru, if you like militarism, the fart to entertain us. I tell myself what military rank you have. I am a general, well, when you have seen a little army without someone to organize it... and a military strategist, I organize the atakes. For example, they have nothing to brag about to me.....They came across a brave man...just that betrayal will bring them to me, whoever it is, I have to enjoy it. I'm going to give EPN 90 boards to you. and I'm going to put my right hand in hierarchy, you'll see. I'm not afraid of anything, their concepts and methodologies are worth shit. I trained with a Russian soldier and a Japanese soldier for all this. And it was talking....They wanted to finish me off. and they lacked eggs to comply with the order
Cheesy.

The Destroyer, Malekith, Surtur, Hela, and Thanos. This guy has quite the resume. Oh and Sakaar Hulk. Geez, no chill man. He wants all the smoke.

I bet he was Thor as thit after the firth hit he took!

What a stupid &amp; brain dead scene. It could certainly qualify as the masses&#39; guilty pleasure.This shows our collective IQs are just so dismal. And then most of us go around thinking that the only bad thing in the world right now is Putin.I think this is why we are so stupid, actually: because we are served with the idea that it&#39;s all Putin&#39;s fault. We just lap all shit like this up like it was whipped cream and now it&#39;s OK to go about our lives like mindless drones. Nothing&#39;s literally our fault because TV has laid it all on Putin.

He selflessly sacrificed his own life for a species that he learned to love and was taught humility, thus regaining his worthiness to wield Mjolnir going from being the prideful, vain and arrogant boy he once was. What an epic scene

John 1:1 &amp; 14

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved



Romans 3:10 and 23

10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;



Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking)

31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.

32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.



1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”)

For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:



Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.



Acts 4:12

Neither is there salvation in any other - for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.



Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.



Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.

<a href="">0:21</a> so bad special effect
Movie name
Wow

Thor in the 1st movie literally is the God of Hammer lol then his father told him he is not.

So he created a tornado in the middle of the town but only the evil guy gets sucked up but not one of them houses and this scene is awesome to you 😂 and who ever built them that town is the goat

Joseph Mary House of David Jesus David Christ Bethlehem Judea

Thor was good early MCU

No it’s not over Thor the world needs you

The enemy is cooler lol
Kind of sad how his power is downplayed in future movies. He’s so much stronger than what Marvel depicted him as in the Avengers saga.

Nice cartoon

Damn the direction in this film was awful ahaha

It could have been done, when this piece of iron hit Thorne, it would have crumbled and would have been “realistic” too.
terrible

I thought he was already thor

I always find it weird that Thor never makes a tornado like that against his enemies again after this film, it seems like a very useful ability

A

Sheltered little ❄️ Natalie, wake up

Thor is 1 billion more ridiculous than the most ridiculous movie in the world. If there is any level of nonsense, this is it.
Iron Man 1 still feels up to date whenever you see it. The screenplay and sequences frame by frame is so classy !

With the Mjolnr Hammer you will get the whole Thor dress too. Its free!

Goosebumps 🔥🔥
Goooooosebuuummmpss
Best part of this movie

Thor was so strange😂😂

Endgame: you should have gone for the headYears before that: went for the head

※The Manchurian country was the breakwater which prevented aggression of the European and American Great Powers. Because this breakwater was torn, the Soviet Union invaded Manchurian and stole the Japanese northern territories The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Russia, China, North Korea become the Communist Party nation, and Korea carries out an anti-Japan activity, too. The rotation of Japan is full of enemy countries. Asian Communist Party prevented becoming it Manchurian country. When the United States thrusts Hull notebook and withdraws from Manchurian. Because it led to destroying a country to withdraw in Manchurian, Japan set war for self-defense and liberation in Asia. When it is a war crime. Russia, the United States, China still take Japan in the same pro-war inclination country in old days.



The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. The worker competes against a company for a right. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?

The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.



The human whom the United States drops an atom bomb and I burn you to death to a woman, a child, a baby and slaughtered is the greatest devil in history. I used it as a guinea pig and killed a Japanese 400,000. Why does the United States not apologize? The United States won against the Great War and got world hegemony. Because the American obtains the right, it is equally punishable. The United States gave a vivid description of the power of the atom bomb and threatened the Soviet Union in it and had a world right in my hand. It is wrong with unfairness to make economic sanctions because the United States of such devil lets North Korea abandon a nucleus.



The accident of Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights is a stratagem of the United States. By a threat to let Japan accept the Plaza Accord, the U.S. military plane shot it down and burnt the person who survived to death by a flame thrower. 520 victims were considered to be a sacrifice. The United States caused a bubble burst by a strong yen instruction and a share price manipulation, and Salomon Brothers sold it at a profit before the sudden fall of the stock and thereby plundered Japanese financial power of a nation. The discovery of the crash point was not late and was a delaying action of the evidence destruction. It is the collection of the piece of the missile and destruction work of the pressure bulkhead.



As for the Japanese slaughter case that I performed of Mason of the United States, there are emperor silver case, Nabari poison wine case, Fukuchiyama Line derailment, Chinese food plane crash, Wakayama poison curry case, the sarin subway attacks in Tokyo, the Matsumoto sarin incident, Kyoto animation arson terrorist incident besides. Because the Akihabara slasher case had a suspicious point in various ways, Tomohiro Kato of the criminal might receive a hypnotic suggestion, brainwashing.



In other words, Mason of the devil rules the world and schemes the world conquest using the United States. Because the greatest enemy is Japan, economy interferes it to destroy it thoroughly and is going to poison you using medical care, food. In Japan, a politician is assassinated if I go against an American policy to order, and the nation is slaughtered by a mysterious case not to know of the reason, too. Because Shoichi Nakagawa refused purchase of the US Treasury, I was assassinated.



An American, a Chinese, a Korean do the cruel brutality case.

[brutal person and ばむ cruelty] In tyushu case by the Chinese soldier, as for the man-eating group, the Korean, American Mason that exceeds far eat-like-a-dog manner group it drinks blood and the meat of the infant.

If rape it, and eight women are stabbed to death at the Asahi eaves, and people split lengthwise see mind;-resistant; did not pass. I looked at the person がの dead body like the proprietress at a close tower on the waterside entrance. As for the man, an eyeball is dug out; the upper body is hive . At the Japanese store close to the Nanjo gate, the dead body of the person like the master was left on the way, and a bone of the middle was exposed, and the internal organs were scattered.

There is the trace which almost all is fired, and the dead body of the Japanese boy left in a firm and the government office touches a rope, and took, and the blood sprays it on the wall, is for a language.

The video is <a href="">

</a>

A Japanese, awake. All the aims of the Chinese nuclear missile are sent to Japan. It is the United States that controls North Korea in the back and gives a Japanese abduction case, an order of the missile launch. These are parts of Japanese race extinction operation, and Japan is burnt to the ground by nuclear attack. The United States attacks it to Japan with the armed forces of the world. A Japanese deceived in the fraud of Japan-U.S. security treaty stupid.



Near future to read from Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan

April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3. It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.

x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021.

World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day

 Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes are generated in all parts of the world. 

An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea 

The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024



Final note

The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. It is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light. Are all of you ready?

can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 11 years since release date

Please bring Portman back to MCU...

all think watch enternals is think resin asgurd float disk is a celestial popped out bottom that plant destroy everything but disk.   there celestial that waring something looks destroyer armor.

that walk in the end like he’s so used to this kills me

this clip is great

That dramatic walk at the end was my favorite part

Thor back then: literal god of the sky with Zeus-level powerThor now: Pew pew lightning go boom

It&#39;s so cool how moljner returns to him

so why he didn&#39;t fight like that against thanos ? :s

Omy godness 🥳
<a href="">

I wonder how the hammer knew to come to his hand at the right time 🤔

&quot;oh my god&quot;Are you from the church if Thor?

What is the movie name?

Cgi at its peak

The CG at the end is not good

<a href="">#JusticeforJohnny</a> pity wb disney and marvel are on the wrong side of history. I hope they realize their mistakes cos I really want to see their movies.

Dude I swear that thing was like 3 times bigger when I watched it when it first came out lol

Damn he bitched slapped Thor like dat

why did they nerf thor so much after his first movie?

The ritzy perch reassuringly satisfy because age philly tempt including a trashy patricia.  fixed, zesty lyric

Movie name p
Never watched and never will.

this effect of him slapping the tor is kind of ridiculous, it seems that there was a lack of budget for the fx effect

Omg this is horrible what this movie make 199 million?

Now that I look at this after so much time...Janes acting looks........... kinda fake

She said no just ñike in star wars , no Heineken, when obiwan lands in the plane

Are we gonna ignore the fact where padme leaves anakin for thor

Bait
Now Thor hammer is female because woke Marvel i swear NA pop culture comics are absolutely trash it&#39;s a shame the MCU is gonna suffer because of left politics gender studies.

Come-on btich fight distroyer
I remember seeing this destroyer. This thing still looks terrifying.

The effects of the backhand to the face are done so badly.

Rewatching this scene for so long, I only now realize how boring and embarrassing it is hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I honestly thought he was trolling her, and that he was just faking.

Damn it’s so funny Mcu Thor fans hate the first 2 movies so much and want to dick suck the third I actually like the first one and it’s direction with the Asgardians more than any other movie and Loki and Thor’s character development in the first two is unreal

The 2000s and slanted shots went hand and hand

nooooo

His teammates are as useless as mortals
❤ Search miracles of the holy &quot;Quran&quot; / &quot;Qadir khutba&quot;!

I don&#39;t think Anakin would appreciate that LOL!

Loki’s face looks so innocent in this movie

It&#39;s amazing how forgettable all the pre avengers movies are. Apart from iron man 1. If anyone remembers captain America it&#39;s because it&#39;s just a kid friendly saving private Ryan

“No, it’s not over.  We have 2 sequels and 4 avengers movies to film.”

Scene look like of DC movie

it looks like Odin removed the condition and returned the power to Thor. I Can&#39;t see anything special in Thor to be worthy among everyone

If he does that to Thor then If the destroyer hit a civilian they should explode into a red fog

The first Thor movie reminds me of a very specific time period in cinema. Like, the weird Michael Bay-ish way of making movies with unnecessary slow motion and dutch camera angles.

Kenneth Branagh dutch angled the <b>**</b> out of this scene.

Jane and Thor were prolly the worst couple

This was such a dumb fight

For dark world…
<a href="">

It is the same thing like the sentinel in the X man

Resurrect like a dog!
Dying probably is the most realistic action to getting a bitch slap from a big ass metal boi

The &quot;oh... my... God...&quot; sounds very fake and ill-rehearsed. I&#39;m sure Natalie Portman had a lot of different takes. Unfortunately the director chose a poor one.

J

Thor : &quot;Kill me and end this&quot;Loki : Kills him and ends itAlso Thor when he got his powers back : You dare to touch me mf.

I forgot how awesome the destroyer looks

Why is everyhing at an angle?

I laughed way too hard at how he turned around and just smashed Thor in the face

My hero of all time ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👑
He needs a snickers bar

Ljh

<a href="">

Yo good for Padme she got outta that toxic relationship with Anakin and rebounded with fuckin Thor lmao

If Thor is the god of thunder, why does he have lightning powers?

 arrive in wakanda

<a href="">0:21</a> Good lord that CGI is horrid

This is god-awful-Thor would certainly not be dead from one hit, and they would have definitely picked him up and tried to get him medical attention, not just- ASSUME he was deadThe tears also seemed insanely fake, and so did their reactions when he &quot;became Thor&quot;.And then, when Thor was flying in the air- WHY DIDN&#39;T THE &quot;DESTROYER&quot; SHOOT HIS BEAM?? THOR WAS BUSY SWINGING HIS HAMMER, HE WOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BLOCK IT XDDDDThis is a laugh fest, but I guess that&#39;s what makes it enjoyable

Which movies is this..??

Who was that at the end?

god seeing thisthor:*grab hammer

Why all the dutch angles?

The last scene is op. It looks like nothing happened 😂

<a href="">3:25</a> proved Chris Hemsworth follows cricket. I guess a big fan of Ricky Ponting. 😜

Goosebumps even after so many years ❤️

Are you Thor God of hammer

That&#39;s why Rogers can &quot;summon&quot; thunder in the avengers ! &quot;shall have the power of Thor&quot;

just gonna throw this out there, loki is controlling it with like 3 seconds of delay while he is galaxies away? uhh... magic

I was really hype when thor gained his powers and the fight but now seeing this fight make me realize why was it so short??

Lmfao!! Im so glad i dont waste my time watching these movies anymore.

Give me a good quality can opener and I&#39;d beat this &#39;Destroyer&#39;

Anakin!!!

Thor the God of comebacks

now he was nerfed

god I&#39;m so glad Natalie Portman wasn&#39;t in the rest of the movies.

The director of this movie dosnt know what destroyer is.....This was disappointing

he can summon that hammer from a different universe for god sake you can just kill him lol

<a href="">3:37</a> Tyrone Magnus

Ngl the destroyer is the worst mcu villain out there

I legit thought this was a clip from xmen days of future past, then I read the title

Anyone else notice how the cut over his eye @<a href="">0:45</a> foreshadows him losing that same eye to Hela?

The worst Marvel movie of all time. I&#39;d rather watch Spiderman on &quot;Electric Company&quot;.

They really spamming the deutsch angle for no reason in this movie

He was quite literally jumpstarted

It's strange that his face doesn't have a dent.
Odim arrives now, &quot; Are you Thor the God of the Hammer?.... It always has been 😂😂 so much so that if someone is worthy and lifts the hammer they have the power of Thor...
thor vs argus

Oh this is the movie that they filmed with a broken tripod

Guy vs Dude

Man this movie was hella awful haha

I am not crying, you&#39;re crying!

lol such a shitty movie and fight. CGI looks from 1980s

Oh my god, that's horrible CGI.
<a href="">0:22</a> such a meme

A TRULY BADASS SCENE

The whole movie had tilted shots , dafuq was wrong with the director

God these first 2 stand alone Thor movies were so bad 😂😂

<a href="">0:21</a> watch yo mfing tone

Poor destroyer, it went for the head and still failed

This woman&#39;s attractiveness distilled vanilla water. It&#39;s so fucking boring to look at her.

This thing was made to fight Celestials in the comics, MCU Destroyer is heavily nerfed.

So the destroyer who instantly vaporized frost giants could easily be killed by thor in a matter of seconds, but thor and his warrior crew had to be saved by odin from a bunch of frost giants

man this movie so bad i keep forgetting it exist.

I believe there is an Bollywood and DC director behind this scene😂🤣

and that's when a woman wets her panties.
<a href="">0:20</a>Love how a magical sentry isn’t beyond a petty ass pump fake before a bitchslap.

In this movie they already foreshadow thor&#39;s right eye gonna get blinded one day.

They totally ripped this off of The Matrix lmao

It looks like this might have been a prototype for the cgi used on Colossus.

Astonnishing how bad the CGI was in this movie compared to nowadays

What nonsense
<a href="">#new</a>

That OMG scene was a good way to ruin the movie.

Always thor

Thor love and thunder

There&#39;s some weird  CGI going on there at the end of <a href="">0:22</a> where Thor gets smacked if you play it at 0.25x speed.

If you see this comment you know what to do for the boys

The last good Thor movie

This movie so cornyyy, good for little kids tho.

I hope Natalie can make the MIghty Thor costume look good as the comics, she&#39;s quite petite.

I love that at <a href="">3:47</a> it shockwaves an entire county/town yet 5 seconds later it’s a tiny tornado that barely affects the street they are all still standing on. Bravo

The graphics suck
This looks incredibly like the first transformers with the angled shots and explosions.

YOU DARE REFUSE MY BATCHAL!?!?!

Meh...

cool how a slap to the face gets him CUTS ON HIS CHEST

This scene is so cringe

how exactly does one knock aside an energy beam and what was the point of the tornado he created?

I was surprised I liked this movie

Is everyone notice. They watch the fight too close. And they are not flying like the car

If you Forge Miljnëüêr into a Green Lantern Ming of Desire and Fire 🔥 could Thœrn become a Fire and Brimstone Thunder GAUDe☄️🔥💀⚡
If A Green Lanternn put his Ring 💍 ⭐ in the Flaime-

The Biblical Ende the First and Wüerst Iron Man

@ <a href="">0:00</a> you see the Arch-Nemisys along with 2 Çroxxes ✝️🕊️✝️
Broke neck, back jaw, and still talking lol

<a href="">0:20</a> terrible animation 😂🤣😂🤣🤣
The Destroyer look like some monster from Ultra Man ngl

What rubbish man...worse than a Brazilian film...!!! 💩💩💩😀😀😀
Even a god can&#39;t keep a earthly woman

Just see the VFX ‼️that&#39;s MCU 😌

The Destroyer is also seen in X-Men: Days of Future Past

Thor is a Namekian, confirmed. He can create clothes with his powers

What a crazy game 🤦‍♂️
This movie is so cheesy and stupid. Awful acting and writing

So happy they changed Thor&#39;s personality..I can&#39;t even watch his old movies..he&#39;s was boring and dull

Fun fact : Thor could have died permanently right there if the elevators and the coat rackets know how to move

Funny how super hero&#39;s never land on their necks

I really want to see Ironman or Hulk fighting that destroyer 😁

Man this movie was bad...

These scenes are so stupid. Why didn’t the destroyer just walk over there and crush Thor’s head while he was down.Makes no sense.

Love this. Thor is such an important character!

The no girl is such a worthless &quot;actor&quot;

<a href="">00:22</a> it is interesting how intuitively we know there is a problem in this scene.  When Thor is hit, he should keep rolling in the air, but the roll suddenly stops and he keep going in the air.

Stupid ass shit 3 minutes of commercial for a2 minutes video fucking stupidity

What a time, Mr. Don Simón, the first movies without so many special effects, the first Avengers, we are old.
Ah yes, Thor, the God of hammers

Greatest back-hand of all time

I kinda wish every Thor movie had this safe feeling to it. Very Hamlet esk. For obvious reasons.

No wonder anakin turned to the dark side padame is a whore.

Ugh this girl was annoying

All religions, parties, countries and borders have been exorcised, so that every party, every country, every religion says that what I say is right and slaughters each other. Whether they are Jews, Christians, Muslims or adherents of any religion in the world, those who pray, those who fast, those who go on pilgrimages, those who go to church, those who go to synagogues and those who sacrifice. Those who give alms, those who build mosques, those who build synagogues, those who build temples, everyone will go to hell. I am neither mahdi nor messiah nor moshiach, I am the messenger of the creator sent by the creator to all humanity and the messenger of the apocalypse. If human beings are not united, they will disappear in 2028!!!'&amp;
Just want to take this opportunity to vomit in Chris Hemsworth&#39;s face. Prissy little aussie girl didn&#39;t like the way Thor&#39;s helm made his hair look,  so they never made him wear it past the first scene. OH, I&#39;m sorry Chris you piece of shit,  I&#39;m 56, got a full run of Thor from Journey into Mystery 84, buying comics since I was a kid,  waiting my whole life to see a decent comic book movie,  BUT YOU DON&#39;T LIKE HOW THE FUCKING HELMET LOOKS? YOU DON&#39;T DESERVE TO SMELL THE ASS OF THAT COSTUME AFTER I WORE IT FOR A MONTH,  AND HAD NOTHING BUT TACOS AND BEER TO EAT YOU BOWL OF OATMEAL OF A HUMAN. I HOPE THAT COSTUME GIVES YOU AN INCURABLE CHAFF THAT MAKES YOU PICK YOUR ASS IN PUBLIC FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.  You&#39;re the margarine of Thors. You&#39;re the diet cola of Thors. And that Hammer looks like shit too. Looks like a Halloween costume prop. GARBAGE

your cgi
that Oh...My...God made me cringe

<a href="">1:58</a> Gotta love the symbol clipping over the rocks.

<a href="">2:56</a>

just like Ukraine vs Russia

And Alec Baldwin didn&#39;t shoot anyone 😁

THOR: Bring me Thanos!!!!JANE: He&#39;s in that tin suit.

Thor Da
He went for the head this time

What is the name of the movie

yeay superman! such childish crap movie

Good story but really bad acting

What was there in the smoke farted, grunted, and we are supposed to believe that the invulnerable robot made entirely of titanium was somehow damaged. WHAT THE FUCK???!!!!!
couldn&#39;t just throw a hammer at that tin and that&#39;s it? What is this show for?

God of thunder vs metal worm

Pretty stupid how the dude of thunder has nothing but lightning.

Awesome😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Thunder king ⚡
Man, if he had no power, he would be dead from that punch, 100%

father buff
The tornado was strong enough to take the destroyer off the ground and the spectators enjoyed in peace.

I BET MY REVOLVE ON IT😈😇😆
Destroyer was actually much more powerful weapon in comics then MCU.

When I was watching Thor versus the destroyer I was so scared that the world was going to die

<a href="">0:23</a> I don&#39;t know why but when Loki made the destroyer back hand Thor, I couldn&#39;t help but chuckle a bit lol

When Jane says “Oh my God”Thor should’ve answered: “Yes Jane, that’s me”. 😂

Loki could have killed him but chose not to, he really can&#39;t bring himself to do it

Unpopular opinion: this movie is better than shitty Ragnarok

Biggest fan of cris .hamsworth....

Hello, if you like this model of the
This gives “if you’re nothing without the suit, you don’t deserve it” vibes

The first Marvel movies were full of bullshit lol

maybe not the best fight scene, but i&#39;ll be damned if Thor getting his hammer back, and proving himself worthy by sacrificing his own life isn&#39;t a great Phase 1 moment.

Odin win

He who is worthy will then have the power of Thor
Me: &quot;That&#39;s what it feels like!&quot; (To be one of us who bleeds)

This was a pretty good movie. Don&#39;t understand the hate

The only film that respected and got Thor&#39;s powerset right, I love how he included the formation of a tornado showcasing Thor&#39;s control over weather and the elements. Something we never see again sadly, would love to have seen him summon &quot;the winds of a thousand worlds&quot;.

I’m two years old and I really enjoyed this 🥸



Movies get dumber and dumber and dumber every day now.

Thor is here

Do people actually watch this garabge. No wonder the world is in a bloody awful mess.

A worthy deed
Is the hammer more powerful or the ten rings more powerful?
At least now thor is just not hammer dependant guy

Thor needs some chain, because we all know real big heavy chain link is the strongest thing in the universe, what ? You haven’t noticed?

I like the fact that jane has a t shirt of miss minutes

I like the little sound and visual effect when Mjolnir breaks the sound barrier returning to Thor&#39;s hand 🙂

You just know Loki is thinking &quot;Oh shit!  I think I just screwed up!&quot;

Hi🇪🇪
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD high five
God! Is this kind of crap being filmed now? And they go to see this crap in cinemas?
Destroyer suit On ant man suit With doctor doom mask

Thor has a nice smearing of make-up in this movie

Padme!

what a teeny booper scene.

Thor, the destroyer is back

Carnival and February!
I had no idea that the destroyer was the first character that Stan Lee ever created

It makes me sad that every single character in the MCU has become a snarky jokester.  I miss this Thor.

The sound when he hits Thor happens before contact is even made lol

do you make money from this video? need an answer

Love how she was sobbing just a second ago and the next scene, its just &quot;oh..my..god. <b>giggles</b> &quot; like what kinda string budget acting was that

After such a blow he should have crumbled to the bones. 🤣🤣🤣🤣He’s a bitch👆👆👆He’s still talking. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍
Much love you SKY GOD ultimate Dovahkiin MIGHTY THOR⚡⚡🔨⚡⚡
Why didn’t they use destroyers when hel was attacking Asgard

My favourite scene

<a href="">00:28</a>  Miss minutes....

BEST SCENE EVER! My FAVORITE Scene in the MOVIE!!! Goosebumps! Thunder God, Thor Rocks! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Stupid shit ever

This is worst cgi character

When you forget that you&#39;re battling the God of Thunder!

<a href="">3:30</a> reminds of infinity war Thor vs Thanos scene

I AM NOT THE GOD OF THUNDER. I AM THE GOD OF COMEBACK

Thor: me god of thunderAlso thor : me sleep when I lose

Bitch, I&#39;m Thor.

I liked it when this Destroyer guy was on South Park during the Stuffing Wars.

Every time I see that scene, all I hear is &quot;Oh, My, Terrible Acting&quot; She was a plank in Star Wars, she&#39;s a plank in these and will be a plank as Thorina. What was it he called Thor ? OH ! Yeah. That&#39;s what they should call the movie, not Love and Thunder but Thorina, goddess of sparkly fingers

Long live Las Vegas!
This looks like WB tv show

It's This scene was handled very badly
God, how can you watch this cruel crap...
<a href=""> Miracles from God
that&#39;s why you can&#39;t beat an stralian .............. we are too invincible !

Good scene

this looks like a sentinel from the x men
Loki put up more of a fight and he isn&#39;t even a fighter.

<a href="">2:40</a> Panty dropped

I think the OMG wasn&#39;t necessary

Pink ranger still hot
Thanku

Cool video

Corny

Well ideally people die of that punch from destroyer ..Thor with no powers isn&#39;t it ..but they cannot kill a cash cow

Was that a sentinel from xmen?

The scene is s*it

There is a sign on the hammer, all women are witches
Wow fake movies!

Ima sound like ur mom, but this should be longer and harder. The damn Destroyer ffs.

Don’t cry all father 🤟❤️🤟😭😭😭😭 😭 ( how you making me cry )
The worst mcu film besides the sequel. Just terrible.

I love thor brooh 😥😥
He failed to say... &quot;with the power of greiscol&quot; XD
Superman is stronger and simply the better character
Bloody shit! Hahahaha

is it just me or does “the destroyer” look a lot like a modified version of those things that were trying to kill off the mutants in Days of Future Past?

Destroyed got destroyed in minutes

Hard to watch any movie now knowing the B&#39;s communism that runs through ot

The boy livessssss

<a href="">

God, what kind of bullshit is this!!
That&#39;s when Thor didn&#39;t have humour

The last immediate storm off scene has issue.

Thor is so cringe.

Ahahah

More coffee!

God damn were those thor movies bad. The only good one was ragnarok

It go down too easily, in the comix it&#39;s a scaring thing being chased by the distructor literally nothing on earth could scratch that motherf****er piece of armour

Gees!!!

I like this pre &quot;The Avengers&quot; era where everything is raw-ish...

If your around Thor and you don&#39;t see his hammer,but hear a jet stream get the hell out of there

They want us to focus on the fight but for some reason they keep showing the lady at regular intervals. Are we fighting or not? Pick one

It&#39;s capped resurrection it&#39;s true.... Not just for Thor....for all of us brothers and sister... Wake

 movie

ah yes the god of hammers

I&#39;ve never seen this and haven&#39;t watched very few &quot;superhero&quot; movies but this is incredible.

The first thor movie was the best

The Hollywood - just crushing all the laws of physics,biology, chemistry and even commonsense 🤣

Movie name ??
Lame

Filme incrivel

Now that&#39;s a bitch slap jeez.

the o my god line was so poorly delivered it still bothers me to this day

oh bradyatina
have to says be cool to have power back

Thor throughly kicked his ass💪

In Norse mythology Thor was unbelievably powerful but his hammer was the most powerful weapon ever forged capable of tearing down thousands of giants and yet here it takes him a minute to take down the destroyer......Which is a little pathetic in comparison

<a href="">2:23</a> queue the most generic &quot;something good&quot; is happening soundtrack ever
