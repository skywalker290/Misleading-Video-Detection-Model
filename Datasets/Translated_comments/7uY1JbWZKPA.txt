I am Mexican and I have become eager to see more Indian films, I definitely have to see it after reading your recommendations ❤
2024

It&#39;s it to a great well best.😊

Why are there no dialogues in the trailer, it is mostly made of music. This is slightly worrying. That being said it is my favourite movie of all times.

So my bf is not indian. He watches indian movies with me but has never seen this before. We have been working towards this one since it&#39;s sooo long. Found this trailer so he could decide if he wanted to watch and my word you can&#39;t tell anything from it 😅😂😂😂😂.

Congratulations for completing 22 years of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham

Happy 😊
Is this not a sequel to kuch kuch Hota hai?

I ❤ srk and Karol best

Great actors good movie

Fact :-You are here cause you have already watched it 👍❤

Hit like if you are watching this in 2023

Pehele trailer se zyada film pe dhyan diya jata tha isiliye filmein acchi hoti thi aajkal film pe zyada trailer pe by the way Iam 90&#39;s kidSRK❤ IS CHILDHOOD CRUSH

Not just a movie this masterpiece is an emotion

Only kjo understands the real potential of Shahrukh Khan. All kjo movies along with srk were something else which cannot be created now. Whether it is his latest rockey and Rani.

My mom brought this home on VHS 📼

Deleted scenes ko add karke again release karte toh phir se ye movie hit hota. Rocky aur Rani ki Prem Kahani se best hota..

Any one here after rocky aur rani trailer. I feels kkhh was once in a bluemoon magic. Even kjo can&#39;t recreate that era❤❤

Who&#39;s here after watching ROCKY AUR RANI KI PREM KAHANI trailor?

Came here after watching Rocky aur Rani Ki prem kahani trailer. And realised this era of KJ was something else. I doubt his new movie can recreate those magics. K3g, kkhh, khnh, mnik all were class apart, stylish, dramatic, melodramatic, larger than life characters but at the same time heart touching, classy elegant. They were perfect blender of love, comedy, madness, romance, emotions, relationships and the awesome casts. And the musics were so good. There is not a single song of those movies which I don&#39;t like.

The Best Movie EVER ❤❤❤
Karan Johar’s Fictional World..
Any one 2023???

This looks like donkey if ya know what I mean- like 7-11 mixed with 9-11 and apu from the Simpsons

Childhood memories 💜💜💜
This era of Bollywood are unforgettable This Shahrukhkhan will always remember

Bakwas movie

Woahh,, Every frame, every melody,.. this movie is lives in our emotions.

Shahrukh Khan is a best best actor for all timeLove 💕😘 Action, Drama, Comedy perfect in all characters

It was a 14th December 2001 kabhi Kaushi kabhie Gham.... Full movies.. Karan Johan.. Director.. Soo very good Very Good.. 👍👍👍 🎊🎊🎊🎊💞🎉🎉🎉🎉😎😎😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎
Go to anyone and don't open doors to anyone.
Glorious well. So good. Best.

This single movie is enough to represent entire Bollywood

My first movie jo theatre mai dekhi thi...2001 ko bas 7,8 saal ka tha

Once in a ages 💎

That was a masterpiece way ahead of its time ❤️

Bible fresh waters

they really don&#39;t make movies like this no more..

On that erra how well designed the trailer is  they don&#39;t reviled the songs but they use every bit of those song

Abhishek bacchan should give a special appearance in this video

<a href="">1:09</a> - <a href="">1:12</a>.   Bekhayali soundtrack nothing is original my Gs

Karan made this film when he had sense of family values.

2022 stil favourite
Amitabh Bachchan sir, jaya Bachchan mam, shah rukh khan sir, kajol devgun mam, Hrithik Roshan sir, kareena kapoor khan mam and all other actors and actresses are acting is superb in this hindi movie kabhi khushi kabhi gham and the music is awesome and fantastic and the songs are superb to hear in the morning hours and in the evening hours okay 👋😀😇😇👍👍👍👍👍🎉🎉🎉🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹👌👌💐💐

The greatest bollywood movie

2 sbse badi bat movie ki amitabh bachan amd voice of lata di

Kabhie khushi kabhie ghamThe perfect title. Haste haste kab ro denge pata hi nhi chalega.

This movie is just awesome ♥️♥️

The best actors in India came together to make this film, it has been many years since I first saw it and it is still my favorite
Karan Johar Movies are always special . There is something extraordinary in each movie and every movie is special and carries a particular theme. Though the story is simple but it is presented in such  manner that it leaves memories in our heart forever and we  never feel bored watching that movie again and again. The direction , screenplay ,music everything is superb . We laugh ,we cry and we learn so much from these movies .thanks Karan for these priceless masterpieces.

No story revealed..this was past..movies with substance and trailer revealing nothing..but now a days.. trailer shows entire movie

It is best. Accusteelsoodiesote.

Agar esi movies ab aa jaye to south ki film chalna band ho jayengi

Karachi mein videos centres ka harami pun yeh tha ke her new copy mein 2 se 3 scene ghayab, aur craze was such k her dfa un scenes ko dekhne k lie we would bring the cd on rent and watch the whole movie..SRK was the King back then

This is such a grand movie. Each scene of the movie gives you goosebumps.

This movie is really emotional

Still goosebumps in 2022. Like if you agree 👍🏼

Whatsoever anyone says, but Karan Johar&#39;s all films are box office cult...I love how he direct his movies, not the recent ones but ya old onesCannot imagine this was his 2nd movie only

Such a crap trailer for a crap movie!

It&#39;s an full emotions

&quot;It&#39;s all about loving your parents&quot; the best thing❤️

Jzt Oh My  God!!😍
Best time of 2001🥂❤️
Uff this film

20 years of this epic movie 🍿

20 years completely

Hats off to Karan who dared to bring these legends together...The movie has a special place in our hearts. Back then, I still remember I visited the video center to get a copy of it multiple times as it was only available in video cassettes in karachi.

20 years complete this movie

The caption at the end was more suited to Baghban than it was to K3G.

My all time fav movie... Just love this one.. Lots of memories are there with this movie... I first time took to my mom theater for this movie wich i wl never forget.. Love u srk.. Loved d bonding with u nd jaya bachhan is the best part of the movie... 😘😘😘

Today Mark 20 Years Of This Movie....✨✨✨Thanks Dharma Movies For Making Childwood Awesome ❤️✨🌈
I am being immersed in the way how jaya bachchan expresses herself in those emotions and the other reason is shahrukh khan. Just finished now, yes still because you can cravings like this. Loved each and every part of the movie but totally got blown away and felt a deep sense in jaya bachan expressions. She is the best mother to him ❤️

Where are the Arabs?

SRK AND SK BOTH ARE LEGENDS.

Where are such films distributed now...😔😔

K3G IS HOLY

This film is in my heart's all time favorite list. Saamil Nahi ho paayi - Bajah hai - Kharina Kapoor only and only with her Bajah se pure family. Watching this film with her pure family is like watching an erotic movie. It's an unfortunate thing to have a role that is a little decent and can be seen with the family. Toh - All Time Favorite.
i miss k3g

hrithik can do any role....so versatile

Just because this movie is good is not enough. I like the attitude of the main character, who leaves his family home because the family did not accept his beloved. Well done India.

I don't know why... But even when I see Sharukh's acting... my tears start flowing.
Nice video

Everyone is a gang of thieves. They play with the emotions of the audience. Would Sushant Singh Rajput have ever got a place in this scene and would these people have tolerated him? Art survives from the artists, not from the families. Nepotism, groupism, favorism, prostitution, narcotics, girl trafficking, child trafficking, human trafficking… all are run by the public and They pretend to be pure and get themselves worshipped. Everyone is dishonest. Boycott! Disfellowship!!

A subtile study of KKKG has been realised by the French writer Mrs D. Aubier into her book about Indian cinema where she reveales the symbolical and archetypal structure of the film. +++ <a href="">

Dear Karan Johar .Dharma productions must be renamed as &quot;Disney Families of India&quot;.RichGloriousPretty&amp; Flaunting every thing

Could you please put it in Spanish, we would appreciate it very much with all my heart.
I would like to see this movie as I could see it subtitled in Spanish. I'm Cuban. I'm looking for it and it doesn't come out complete except for parts of the scene.
It's terrible, the movie is beautiful but this is just the music and I wanted the movie but well.__.
Boycott.... justice for ssr, cbi for ssr 🙏 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I think it&#39;s multi star  movie in 1990s

The music of trailer is amazing

To be honest Jaya ji&#39;s acting touches me everytime..

It's a stupid movie, it's a filmy trailer. You commenters have got money from Dharma production or are you blind again?
Forigners will never understand the   meaning of this movie

My favorite movie

i can’t stop crying whenever the ending of this movie comes. it’s so amazing I’ve watched this so so many times and still can’t help but cry.  this movie is beautiful. dramatic but beautiful ❤️🥺

Biswas nahi hota, Karan Johar has directed it.
Love you 😘❤️❤️
The time I read  in class 8th. I remember lot of  moments

In hindsight this film was over long , however despite its length , the film was very good . Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham put forth the ideas of parental love vs traditions vs oaths . A great movie that offered a rollercoaster of emotions . 8/10. Great preformance by all cast . Rani was a delight in the film . Such an iconic movie and is one of the few indian movies that  started the transformation of indian cinema .

Itep social problem psychiatry. It is slateosteip psychiatry.

This is best movie

Yrrr ye full movie ek saath b bej do plz
How beautiful everything

Please SAND ME k.k.k.g

Batista videos

Iske jaisa aur koi movie hai to batao yaar please please bhaiyo

I don’t watch Bollywood films that much. But because of all the hype I went to see it in the cinema. It was a fun film at the time but I think it’s a bit OTT and silly now.

I remember when this film came out in late 2001. There were posters everywhere advertising it weeks before its release. Everyone was singing the songs and talking about it. Especially Kareena Kapoor’s character. Some cable channelsapparently played it everyday.

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham &#39;It&#39;s all about loving your parents&#39; - a beautiful film by Karan Johar about relationships and bringing families together.

Worst movie trailer ever BTW the movie is the best 🙂

The first bollywood movie i had seen as kid 😊😊❤

I love all the songs in this movie

When it was released ?

This film is in my favourite top 10 films

The Indonesian voice
Kobi kuse kobi him
Karenna Kapoor is the worst choice in this movie ,I wish Aishwarya Rai took her role .

you know what this is my beloved films

kareena kapoor and jaya bachan spoiled the thumbnail.

This is one of my favourites, in my late twenties and I dislike majority of Bollywood films, too much kissing and sex scenes, no longer any family or moral films. I used to love watching filsm with my mom, Mohabattein, Veer Zaara, KKHH, KHNH, love the classics, theses were the films you can watch with family. The last film I watched with my mom was Prem Ratan, that was a clean family film. But this film was one of the best, excellent characters, great acting, amazin songs, clean, no sex scenes and a awesome family firm with a great message. I wish Bollywood goes back to its roots.

shahrukh khan kajol sometimes happy sometimes sad
2017???

super

Without Kareena I can&#39;t imagine this movie. 2nd part was lit just because of her and how can Dharma prod. Not mention her name in the title of this video?

This is one of those films that I can watch for more than 100 timesAnd one of the reasons is &quot;SHAHRUKH KHAN&quot;

SHAVA SHAVA

plzzz full movie
My most watched movie.... More than 100 times

The best movie ever!❤️

Omg best movie 10/10 IGN DANK Worldstar 420 Get mom the camera. Great movie of 1546. Great movie if you love Indian women dancing like the blow ups at those car dealerships. Plus I would reccomend this movie to my friend Abdul Yehee,m and Jafishi Mabar. And I would like to say this movie shoud be rated R because Im not indian and It has a lot of women in it and not enough men. Thank you. :D
