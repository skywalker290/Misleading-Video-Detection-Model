Kindly Tell BGM Of This Video

Kindly Tell BGM Of This Video

I agree with Bablu gulabi chahiye bhai

Why are you black from the womb?
Hwhwhhww

🖤 thanks bhai

I m brown but Gora hona Abke look ko badata hai aap bhi to sawle they paise aane pr ap bhi to gore huye agr sawla hona bhi acha hota to aap ku gore huye sawle hi rehte

No hate but sare every youtuber ldkio ko glt dikahte hai unko Youth ki najarai as a sex toy dikhate hai than 1 rape case ke bad esi video bnakr apne aap ko axha dikahte hai

i am an 18 years old boy with average looks and a short height , many of my friends have slapped me because they know i am not as powerful as they are . everyone calls me bona , chirkut which used to hurt me a lot, but i have tried overcome it but couldn&#39;t  .

Even we want our GOD to be fair though many of them like Krishna ji are actually of Dark skin 😞

Bruh everyone has their opinions on what they think is &#39;good looking&#39; and obviously you would want to marry a good looking person according to your standards You cannot change what people like and don&#39;t like.As for getting successful, I don&#39;t think that depends on your skin complexion. Get better, Stop crying.

this is called quality content

Respect for you bro

Best content ever ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Comment box still Fresh 🎉

That&#39;s I think eren is right 😢

My first comment only for BB ❤

I was rejected 2 times because of skin colour people can&#39;t understand our pain 😔

After watching this vedio I am the biggest fan of your bro..🥺❤️

After watching BB's video, two of my friends married a black girl and the other one married a coolie. Now both of them are living in pain for lifetime, both of them are having ex-marital affair with others. Be practical,
Caste based job reservation stop karo.

Bro I am a boy
True bro ❤❤❤
2.23 to 2.40 best part

YouTube ka aaj tak ka sabse high quality ka video

World is hypocritical bro where you are taught morals in school but most of the time when you get out of school or even in schools see the same morals being crushed 😔😔😔😔😔😔

Fair people - colour doesn&#39;t matter 😢
2023 legend ❤
Bro you have said true fact

Bro earned my respect ❤
Some people never change 👍
Wow just wow

Dil ko gaya❤❤
you are right bro ❤

Goosebumps bhai 😭
No matter how hard you try butIt&#39;s a fact that you yourself like fair people

That moment when you said...kya &quot;______&quot; was just 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Respect++++++++

30000

I like this vdo Big Respect For Bhuvan Bham ❤

Really very nice video dil se respect aapke liye.

Watching in 2023 So one of my teachers told me in class 9 in front of another teacher that the more yellow a person is, the more black he will become. She said, I feel like why am I existing in this world, I feel like I'm going to die when life is lonely but this is what you all should think, black colored hearts are good and that's what I always thought. Why was I born but these people hate me without talking and give weird looks so that no one cares if everyone is happy to know how true it must be if they are around me or if I live in my world then no one will be born sad but Still the heart has to break, no one is sad, read my story, this is the world, what will you do?
Harsh reality

BB this is one of the best video of your and we all need such mentality,

Always everyone insult me because of my skin colour but you are different you are so nice

My Respect For BB Ki Vines ❤️
Love you 💕 bhi
True

Watching this video again after 6 years, still getting goosebumps. According to the &quot;Beauty standard&quot; set by our society, I&#39;m not beautiful because my skin colour is not &#39;fair&#39;. I used to be upset in my childhood and used to think that there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t have and can never have. Besides, I met some people in school who had fair complexion and they used to take pride in their &#39;fairness&#39;. One girl who already had fair complexion, used to complain about her complexion saying, &quot;Omg my complexion has become so dark because of tan, I used to be so fair, now I&#39;m so dark, why did this happen to me blah blah blah&quot;...And I literally could sense that she used to do this intentionally in front of me just to make me feel bad about my complexion. It took me years to accept the way I am. Some of my friends and my family helped me alot to accept my flaws. I&#39;m still working on this. But I want one thing that please never tease someone for their complexion or body or outer beauty because you never know what they already are going through. If you can&#39;t help them to overcome their insecurity, at least don&#39;t make their struggle more difficult.

This video made me fan of bhuvan bam thanks 👍 youtube to recommend me this video after 6years 😊❤❤❤❤

True bro ya we have to think about that no one can says why you are black why you are white god dess making every colour this week😊

This is why we love you bhuvan bam

Bhuvan's mother's eyes!!!!
BB's 4 minute videos are no less than a movie. Every second matters a lot.
Best edit
These are mostly found in states like Delhi and Mumbai, which we call the people of Uttar Pradesh as 'Apadhas'.
The whole video is a social messageBut <a href="">3:47</a>-<a href="">4:01</a> is the most heart touching part💗😭

Mindblowing👌👌👌

Once of the best video of BB

Thank you bhuwan for this video..Some people have no Idea their one Kali word can make you loose your whole confidenceIt&#39;s a very common thing in our society to judge the beauty by fairness

BB Ki Vines

Sir Big Herat fan ❤❤❤
Brother, it's so bad that even my mother and father did not listen to me.
4 mins video but message with lakhs of values.....love you sir

I think this is the best video of BB. Literally I have tears in my eyes. Bcoz I have always been  body shamed due to my overweight. I know how it feels when someone just judge you on your physical appearance and even don&#39;t care about the beautiful and caring soul you have...🥺

This thing is bitter but it is true
:(

Are kyu paka rha h bb. Pura episode hi bana dia ispe. No comedy, only lectures

I never got why fair skin is associated with beauty. Yes, fair skinned people are beautiful, but there are so many things that suit dark people better, for example the muscular warrior look (not that fair people cannot fashion this well). These ideas came from the colonial age and should have gone back out in 1947, but here we are, still stuck with the same thing, unable to think for ourselves.

Hardik Pandya has seen. Dark completion wale bhi hote hai good looking
Truth = 🥒
Proud of You Brother_❤️

I salute Guruji's blessings. ❤❤❤
Brother let's end ♥️♥️♥️

When he wrote in the end BEAUTIFUL- YOU in the end i broke down I had faced so much bullying in my early childhood because I am suffering from obesity and have black skin at same time my parents used to shout at me because of my body

All these people are afraid of speaking after making this video, then people will watch it or understand that we are against racism, but then after that day, someone will judge our colour.

Hats off ❤❤

You put your heart in this video

Mind blowing bro .💯

Tune aaj rula diya 😭
Colour is everything beauty chehre se hi dikhti hain kale ho toh mar jao simple

real influencer

You are right Bhuvan bhaiya 🥲😐

Really heart touching video ❤️

BB iam very satisfied with this video we should not discriminate on the the basis of caste colour creed or religion

babloo uncle ji racer hay
My guy is right. Looks and face don&#39;t matter. I used to think face mattered, but after meeting a girl, I don&#39;t think that is true anymore. Also from the start color didn&#39;t matter.

Come back BB....we miss the real one

With me I am like this, I have always shared a lot of jokes with people.
Respect for uhh❤❤❤❤
Good video

If your racist and you know it clap your hands

Really got impressed🤩🤩

loved this video...Thank you bb...

Bro the point when you told about our ancestors you become wrong because it is Britishers who divided us and told us about racism

The work is done but the truth is done
What are you talking about BB, why did you understand everyone so much?❤❤❤❤
This is Masterpiece ❤️❤️
Anyone Here in the 2023?????????

5Yrs complete 😇🥺😇
BB show the Reality of Society 🥺😭

Heart touching bhuvan Bhaiya...!!

This is a good way to impress a girl, guys.
Right....people still have this matne or this trend continues in bollywood also
Thank you Bhuvan Bhaiya
Exactly, only internal qualities matter not the external  feature of a person ❤

You have spoken truth but aprox 60% population are obsessed with skin colour and bodyshame😢

daily in america

Very nice brother I love you with all my heart ❤❤❤❤
Best video ❤
My skin colour is dusky and l love my skin

Hi bhuvan ji
Mai es dard se Gujar chuki hu heavy depression mai thi but finally right person aye aur mujhe excep kiya

Love from prayagraj

Bb is a very humble and respectful person that is why we love it❤

Yehi aj gyan chod rhe aur success milne ke bad yhi 10 tarh ke creams use krenge aur ad bhi

I think government job in important then white skin😅( JUST A JOKE )

Bhuvan hats off ❤

Thanks

True words
Besy video of bb ki vines

Why are there objections only on black people? If there is no problem in mentioning good looking then what is the problem if it is fair or dark? If it is right to demand good looking spouse then it is right to demand fair complexion too. Change your thinking or look at the thinking of the person in front of you before you are fair or dark than good looking ugly. nothing happened
You guys married black girls
Dil git liya apni bb
Lines are tuch my heart❤

don't do it friend
BB❤
Nice Video Brother I have the same shirt 😀
Nice 🔥🔥
This is the best video of BB 🤍🤍

What about height ?

funny kahn gya?
Brother, everyone will come to speak but when the question is raised, no one will marry the nigga.
<a href="">3:21</a> best line 💞💞💫💫
Love You 99000

Made me cry ....u deserve much more success ... respect u sir 🙏🥺

wow bhai wow
Big Fan Sir 😊
Touched, i also feel that no one loves me due to my colour but this made me realise that I was wrong....

Yes absolutely right. ....🙏

Thank you sir, till today I came without making eye contact with anyone🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹.
Generally I laugh really hard watching your videos but I literally cried after watching this. Everyone bully me because of my thick body and not so fair skin but actually all this starts from our own home . From starting we are taught that fair is good but black is not and this problem is much harder fro girls beacuse everytime we got to hear who will marry you if you keep putting on weight. Sometimes I think that people who have fair skin and thin body are actually lucky because no one everytime is just telling them to lose weight and to have treatment to make their skin fair.

All this is to be said in real life, whether a girl or a boy likes beauty or fair.
Best one dude ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Minimum height 5&#39;8 💀💀
Positive meaning is necessary but in the end everything becomes cloudy.
That&#39;s why Michael Jackson died 💀

I feel every words ❤️

U are the best bb 🥺💕

Okk then what about you ,You are saying it in social media to get views but in reality how much are u following it ,so plz don&#39;t act fair in yourself ...okk don&#39;t mind but it is reality You are no more different then them and us

whole life i have been treated poorly by my looks i felt very much low in all my daily chores every time every second of my life i have been treated illy by my looks once in my life i fell a hell lot racism but still i dont want to be that crow who pretends to a peacock once in my school even my teacher did so with me and some of my friends and even if  i sneezed one more time she told me why i have came to school but the main pillars of my success i s not my hardwork but my parents. i also have been body shamed . now  i am still happy as there is some one who will not judge by looks but my heart my hardwork my love for him or her . the society needs people like you .

I find it one of the best topic in BB video,, hope so that our society aware of this that  nothing on colors,, just matter values ,,

GOOD HEARTED CONTENT❤🙏
Super glad that atleast someone is concerned about such things ❤️

Dhindhora me kali ladki ko main character leke dikhate🗿

My friend name is achyut

Bhuvan bhai true talk

Loved it... This should be spread....

Say no to racism

Love you bhuvan bhai ❤️💖💖💖
BB as you always gave a msg to society, one of this hearts everyone mind ..I have watched repeatedly this vedio to but ur energy inspires us ....tnx BB

I felt it in my life

We should play this video before every Bollywood movie in cinemas and all

Bhai plz make this video to encourage other Love from Delhi

What are you talking about brother, this really happened...😭😭😭
This is my bb&#39;s fav video

Dark color  ✋🌚
Love you❤ bb
Aaj hindu, muslim, shia, sunni, brahman, dalit, maratha, rajput, mughal, Christian, Jews, these all things shouldn&#39;t be seen today, we are in 21st century...History was a tissue paper.. Tomorrow is a question paper, studying for tomorrow is better then cleaning the tissue.India is total earth in it self, every kind of religion, region, people, land, season is there here. Discrimination will end up every thing

What a video bhuvan bhai 🥺❤️
Thank you so much Bhuvan for addressing this.. Recently I have been suffering of low self esteem because of my appearance and my family is mainly responsible for this. My father is a &quot;purane khayalat&quot; kind of person. My parents would often discuss about the appearance of the bride or someone else&#39;s daughter, after attending a marriage or social gathering. And every time I hear them, I feel sad and disturbed. I don&#39;t want to be treated like trash because of my appearance. So the first thing I need to do is to treat myself right. Thank you for this encouragement ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thanks bro

Seriously you are amazing sir 🙂 me bhi hmesa yehi Sochti Hu kyu yeh SB log itni gtiya think rkhte h caste se logo ko judge krte h , face se skin colour se unne judge krte h but woh apni khud Ki kmiyo ko bhul jaate h , saali society ke log hi gtiya h 😠

Bro I am also black 🖤

I have given you a lovely place here.
Vaiii Waahh!👏👏 Babloo Ji Mubarakh Ho Apko Jo Apka &quot;BUDHWA&quot; AV SUCHME BADA HO GAYA! There is no need to remove your heavy makeup kits first..!
Reality about this is that even after watching this video some people will again go and tease people based on their complexion …. and that&#39;s a very sad fact

Love you brother 🙏🏻 u are such a great man

Right things you expose about industry. Hats off BB sir...

Nice video.No bad words.Good.

His parents be listening to him and here my parents would have started arguing even before letting me complete my sentence lol.  Humare pasand se hi shaadi karna hoga!

Absolutely right✨

Respect your art 🤍
Best <a href="">4:35</a> minutes of my life❤️❤️
Very nice bro

Back when black lives Matter was not a &quot;trend&quot; Bhuvan still raised a concerning issue.❤

Bhuvan Bam&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
You were so good so fantastic i just love your these golden words if i will see your videos more than 10000000 times tab bhi mera man nhi bharta

Love you bhai BB ❤️❤️❤️
Salute bro.. sometimes its confusing to decide if its really INDIA or some other country

Everything is fine but ye line thik nhi lagi ki hamare purwaj anpadh jahil aur gawar the.unke time pr asa nhi tha

Hats of to you 🙏!! God bless you 🙏 bhuwan bhaiya 🤍❤️

😔😔😔

BRAVO .... BRAVO...🙏🤟👌👍I did not only like , but I loved it 😃

Bencho rula hi diya tune ❤️
God made everyone human, all these are the thoughts of upper caste, lower caste, black and white people.
True

This is real fact

Its been 5 years of video but comments are still on ..👍👍🤘🤘

True Bhuvan bhaai, I have been blessed with all this in my school life but today I am proud of my fair complexion.
Thanks for telling me what beautiful meant 🥺

LOVE you ❤️ bro and hate you 😈 bro

How many times will you meet my heart ❤️
Bhai you always give a lesson to everyone Who talk to this topic Thankyou for this video We love you 💓💖

this vidio made me cry4

No one really cares about calling me white or black.
Yes you are right 😔😔😔😔

Uff best💔💔🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️
Shaming done in the right manner is good.I&#39;m not talking about white, dark, caste or religion but I&#39;m talking about fat ppl and skinny ppl.. It&#39;s due to the shaming they got they became fit in gyms and increased their productivity

This is why like you and you are my favourite youtuber

Brother, you have done a lot because Puri Duniya had arranged marriage with fair complexion and salary. In our society this food is used at home. He taught us to avoid this or to teach our future generations not to judge them by their colour, height, weight, figure.
Ture ❤
Saachi bat bol di ❤️❤️ heart touching.....And  absolutely right 👍
😢😢😢😢😢 I really ruled ♥️♥️♥️♥️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Salute to your parent’s who raised such a gentleman❤️

Sir, I salute you for making a video like yours and then writing a logo today to create influence. ❤️
I smell racism

God level 🗿❤️
Hi

Good message for our society

Opened the video by mistake... but... 🙏👍👍
I got more confidence today The whole life i had been bullied for my skin colour Thanks 🎧💜💜

Everyone has always been teasing me, today it seems like thank you BB bhaiya, today it seems like there are very few people who even think like this.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I hope opposite gender also understand this

My respect for u is increased by this video

Love to all the people with dark skin. I cant imagine what you guys go through emotionally but I am with you in this fight against racism!

What did you say to me, brother, I feel very bad...everyday I am very close to you, why don't you say goodbye to me?
Also some moron later promoting racist product

Thanks Brother for speaking for us ❤️❤️❤️
verytouching video... hope that u become the best youtuber in india one day🥺🙏

Bhuvan Sir I am 14 years old. Aur mere dant dikhne me bahut bure hain jis se mujhe bohut dukhi hoti hain Aur main logo ke samne bat nahi karta kyun ki main dar ta hun because of my dant. I am also so thin jis ke wajah se ghar ke log bhi mujhe chirhate hain. Main acting karta hun. 1 sal pehle just because of my looking the main role was moved to an another boy aur mujhe side actor de diya gaya..... Aj yeh Video ne mujhe bohut motivate kiya. I loved this video more than Dhindora

Outstanding.... speechless performance
bb said the truth
I am a 18 yrs girl And i shout my self cause I am to late to see this video this touch my heart cause I am brown indian girl jisse apne gharwale hi nahi chodteToBB

Bhuvan bhaiya, I am watching this video today which I should have seen earlier, you are a very good person, that is why you are one of my favorite YouTuber.
Nice one😍😍😍
Love BN ki Vines 💕💕💕💕😘
I never felt bad about my skin complexion and I&#39;m totally okay with how I was born. But people around me makes me feel bad for how confident I am for a brown skinned girl. Like I don&#39;t even have right to be confident if am dark skinned? They expect me to be insecure. BB bhayya, thanks for creating such responsible content.

This video can change mind of everyone so please share with everyone

Being a dark complexion girl I am still insecure about this because &quot;racism ghar se hi suru hoti hai&quot;. When I hear my family or relatives talking about other&#39;s complexion and how beautiful/ugly they&#39;re bcs of their fair/dark complexion it also effects me &amp; makes me more insecure about my look. Videos like this gives me positivity &amp; I&#39;m telling you, parents never taught me to love &amp; respect all complexions but people like you did:)

1 like for sameer 😅

I&#39;m very sad 😢😢😢
❤sach baat sir
Very very heart touching and glad that he is in between highlighting the social issues through the medium of his video and this enormous platform 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

I am fealing good because of this video because I am black in colour

Thank you Bhuvan! Thank you for being there for us... God bless you.. ❤️💫

Huge love and respect for Bhuvan ♥️♥️♥️♥️

This was the motivational video ever I saw 🥲🥲

WHITE 444

most underrated video by bhuvan

This is all bull shit, logo ka dimag kharab ho gaya hain, being a real human being is more important.

A tight slap to those who say BB is misleading kids by using gali

The way he was writing, he was able to press it just by looking at what Anita Kumar had written.
Thats why i love you bro...🖤

Yes bro you are right

raja

Wow bhuvan sir 👍❤️🙏
Had hoped that it would be comedy, Saleh did emotional 😭😭
Correct bro 😥😥😥😥😥😥
What is the timing when you talk about fair lovely and everyone adds to it?
My girl friend rejected me because I am doll in skin colour 😔

Bro I’m 10 years old and I’m black my grandma and my aunty call me &quot;kallu&quot; and that rly hurts

I laughed a lot at a dialogue on the main topic, (How much coal do you eat?) 🤣🤣🤣
Even after 5 years, Still a masterpiece.❤

This is sad true 😭😭😭😢😓

This is reality

people judge me by my colour. But this was a life changing video for me ❤️❤️❤️

My heart is sucked, here is the time, with my sister, this is what happens, that's how it feels, I don't like it, my skin is dark, this is how society maintains me.
Rip techoblade

From many days I think it 🌚 as my weakness but now no more

LOVED IT...❣
I am watching this video again after five years. Exam is over, so many videos of Bbliye are being added to watch history...I have to say one thing...sob log body shaming, has been cut after removing racism...but that is the doctor for heights. It's a joke..nothing has been said about us till now..I'm the fairest girl in my class, I don't turn too much..but in my opinion I am very short..par main is very short. 5feet…..people call me very softly….my confidence has increased a lot…wherever I am, I feel like….people are only me Are you looking at me or are you laughing? I am so short...what is happening...how beautiful am I from so few people...but I am so beautiful as you have made me...what am I able to do. ...Please...pay attention to this thing along with body shaming, racism...I feel bad...I feel like killing myself sometimes...this is how many people I think... Why am I so short...I am beautiful and beautiful (sorry...I am speaking arrogantly...I am talking about bass) yet people don't see this...only people can remove my sorrow. My life's hopes have been destroyed. Sorry hindi is not good.....
Bhai best video ever ❤️😭
Brother are you too emotional?
Heart touching bhaiya

Fact society mindset: You have to be a girl, you have to be fair, the work of the house has to be good. You are a boy with money or on a high post. It is here that India is lagging behind.
<a href="">3:10</a> The most accurate and heart ❤️ sentence

The best influencer ever in India👍

Main bhi anpne skin colour ki wajah se ashamed feel karta tha..but after watching this video nope i love my skin hun to insaan hi na Love u bhuwan♥️♥️ from Assam

etna galat kaise ho sakta hai koi

Good Bhuvan
Too good

😭😭really bro dil chuliya aapne 🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello bai MA 4x4 bai ke aye ke channel se aye hu
The white people came they made it sound like they were better then us and left but we are still living in this complexion even though that toxic relationship has ended but Bollywood and media is still trying to keep those toxicity alive so they can sell there propaganda to us . We have to stand up we have to understand it&#39;s  not. Colour or work or birth that matters . It&#39;s our values .

👍hats of bb

Brother, everyone likes black color, they call themselves black lovers, but all of them are not of this color skin.
Heart Touching Bro. From Pakistan🥲
Watching it after 5 years ! Probably the most heart touching video ever uploaded on this channel... But still it has the less views - This is unfair 💔

Why did you start crying again?
Real influencer , love you BB ❤️🇵🇰
This video of yours touched my heart, I never thought that there would be someone like me in this world. I also say to everyone that there is racism or hypocrisy in my family, even my parents are also hypocratic but not in the main. Thank you Bhuvan bro for the video and watch your video and also log in because racism starts from home.

Hiii

Only dusky girl knows what rejections means from childhood if you are dusky skin girl then you will be bullied and rejected at every steps of your life.however you are educated good paid and independent but people will make you feel down and nowdays in my family they are looking for marriage i can say it&#39;s better to die rather than getting rejected just based on your skin colour

Beutiful defination = heart touching 🙂

:)

Hi

But what will happen by changing the thinking of one person? Every group will have to change their thinking.
You have a very beautiful thing Bhuvan brother.
Heart touching

Galiya to bahut suni tumhare huttad muh se but aj dil chhu liya

Right friend, the same thing happened with me in school too because of that I felt lonely or felt that I was too bad to do anything, I may not be able to do anything but it is good that people like you will think like this to help this generation. Have the courage to move ahead bro, this is a very good message from the heart for the white people.
Then see he will come
But I think your character Sameer is also a slang to people who have unnaturally bigger teeth. But you joking about it is ok. I think you don&#39;t understand the main point.

Nice video 🥰
ap na bhot video ma un fair ko be badava te ta ho

Pls make more of this...

You said it right Bhuvan Bhai ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thanku so much bhuvan bhaiya for making this video😢 Literally I can&#39;t express my words. In my school all students say me kalu, kaalu, Kala bandar, kala langoor and much more and I feels very demotivated sometimes I feel that to commit suicide and sometimes to paint myself with white colour but today I saw your video feels that talent matters not color of skin so, once again thank you so much for making this video 😘🤗🙏
