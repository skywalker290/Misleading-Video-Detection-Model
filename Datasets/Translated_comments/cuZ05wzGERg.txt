Shahid Kapoor ka baap konsa wala hai

It&#39;s Everything about Money 🤑💰 and Fame

Fuckin content...you liarrrr
Leena Chandavarkar was Kishore Kumar&#39;s 4th wife.

What is this horror in the world?
You should also mention 4th marriage of kishore kumar to leena chandawarkar, kishore kumar marriage 4 times in his life,  your information is lesser than ours, we know more than you

very nice 👍
How many more wives you want saif  3 so far maybe 10 more before your expiry date  make a cricket team  your children from many wives

This narrator needs a lesson in English personal pronouns.

Do you have no sense of gender. Where it would be her and where his. Seems making videos on these dumbos you have also become one dumb

It is okay to speak in hindi.

Kishore kumar married to leena chandravarkar..

Big great sperm...
Sanjay Dutt has had 3 marriages

By this video i got to know that all familiar people are married thrice.. And even again familiar people only married them 3rd time knowingly😀😀😀🤔

Kishore Kumar married four times Ruma,Madhubala, Yogita at present Leena Chandravarkar is his wife

In a population of  1. something Billion in India only five of them speaks English...so we shouldn&#39;t judge this lady... I&#39;m not Indian but I had a hard time to communicate with them... from doctor to cleaners to shop owners they speak Hindu... according to history they were colonized by Britain...but when you come to India u will think otherwise... 🇰🇪

Yeh 2nd Jhoot Hai

All actors and actresses don&#39;t take marriage seriously they take it as a joke and entertainment.

They publicly opend but remaining are secret that&#39;s it .

FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST LEARN  ENGLISH  AND KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND HIS.

🙄🙄ma tollywood actress soo better family topics lo

Kabir Bedi, by marrying your wife at the age of 10, you will make her life different from Jahaanm.
No one would have agreed that there is so much life inside them that they have learned Salman Khan's coach since then.
Where did you learn English girl😂😂lol!!!!

U missed Pawan Kalyan 😂

Madam ji, which English school did you study in? Couldn't find the difference between his and hers.. English will also be spoken like this.
Har baar 3rd sadi k baad bolti hai..now they are happily maaried....ruko jara sabar karro.. 3rd wali ko bhi cheat karega.... 4th 5th infinitu tak jayegi sadi....

Kishore Kumar then married actress Leena Chandravarkar have a son besides Amit Kumar

Madam you have changed the sex of all the male actors

Madam pls improve your English

Just wanted to say its “his” and not “her” for men 👀👀👀

Vidya is really nice and kind

Kamal didn’t marry Vidya she was much elder to him, they had affair may be. He married Vani, Sarika and Gauthami was in livein with him. He also had affair with Sridevi.

It’s allowed to have 3 wife’s and extra bits on the side in some religious

What is English? Wow! Sanjay lost his wife
Please didi use a dictionary next time

Madam this ur only work caring 4 others business

Kishore kumar&#39;s 4 th marraige was with Leena Chandrawerker

Ohh god ...three marriages is enough for them...???!!   but I heard &quot;her&quot;..😰😰😰

How can they change their husband wife..so shameful.very bed

They all sleep with nearly everyone in the industry and get married and again remarry...!Who cares they think they all are too good..

Hey, we don't find even a single person here and this world🤦﻿
Congratulations to them... lol

When did kamal hassan marry sri vidya?

Garbage bullywood

Brother, where is Saif Ali Khan?
Pehle English sikhlo tab YouTube pe bolna lol... His and her mein fark nahin maloom tere ko

Horrible English. The anchor does not understand the difference between his and her😀

Sanjay Dutta is a her? 🙄😳 she keeps calling every male “her”. Wtf. Fix your English.

Either narrate in a language you are comfortable with or get a narrator who knows the English language.... you guys don&#39;t even bother to correct the wrong English or the gender mistakes.....

why she keeps using her for man...its his

Kamal Hassan didn&#39;t marry actress srividya. Vani ganapathi was his first wife.

Well formale we use him, his, he  not her. Kishore kumar married 4 times he is survived by 4th wife leena chandrawakar

Her grammar is appalling

Why u r saying her her

Her!!!

His not her 🙄

Where is vanitha vijayakumar

Please don’t change gender

Saifuddin Chori When will you get married and who will she be lucky enough to have children with?
Men u call him not her

The grammar is giving me a headache 🤦🏻‍♀️
Sanjay is a male or can’t lose her it should be his.

Throughout the video the commentator is saying &quot;her&quot; instead of &quot;his&quot;? Basic English.

HER? 🙏😂Atleast do a homework before the video...using her for all the men... I have met kamals wife vani she&#39;s Bharatanatyam dancer

&quot;HER&quot; For Sanjay Dutt, Karan Singh Grover, Siddharth Roy Kapoor, Lucky Ali &amp; &quot;HE&quot; &amp; &quot;HER&quot; both for Adnan Sami🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔Matlab Itna Jyada Gender Confusion????
Yahi sab to bhartiya sabhyata ko kharab kar rahe hai

Please don’t say “her” as they are all men. Say him or his

Who is the idiot reading it? Cause she kept addressing  ‘Her’ instead of ‘His’ relationship.

For an announcer, you should know the difference between him &amp; her orelse don&#39;t announce in English. It gets confusing

To his not to her

Please use him for men not her

Poor english......
Please correct your English, where you have to say his you are saying  her.

So what who cares 😡😡😡Not interested

RIP English... who’s does such silly mistake

Why is the narrator addressing mens as &quot;her&quot;.

You need to improve your English first.

Gautami you forgot about Kamal Hassan

Sahid Kapoor ka bap kon h😂😂😂😂😂😂😀😀😀😀
Why these “guys” are she!!

They have the habit of changing wives not marriage..saloooo

Let them marry as many times as they wish.Aren’t you  gossiping media  getting news from it ?

Gouthami with kamal?

They make mistakes in life n get separated and still get another one but here we no make mistakes still don&#39;t get even one trusted one.. This is kalyug so

Adnan sami is a lollywood star.

Kamala Hassan didn&#39;t marry srividya... they were in a relationship n broke up.. and srividya is not a tamil actress...she is a malayalee

Karan Singh married with HER wife ????

Lost HER first wife ??????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Why are you using.....HER...... Plz improve ur English 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Pl use his instead of her use common sense

Sanjay lost her wife...!!!! Poor bugger

Please do something about your English it sucks

Marita is most beautiful

Why are you  using HER for all the men?

Kamal Hasan married again (4th) time
Correct your english sister

Y these many marriages are legal and not considered as prostitution🙄 I personally feel having multiple  partners jus for pleasure is  commiting adultery! Marriage is something pure bond between &quot;one man and one women&quot;! Unfortunately if a mrg life is not happy one! Better be single and live with high morals rather commiting adultery!

Informative video.. But irritating to here &#39;Her&#39; all the time

Perverts. The most of them married 4 of 5 times🙄

Please improve your English, now English words reading like hindi

I want to know her English teacher 😆😆

RIP to “HIS” English.... 😆😆😆
Her .. 🤣🤣🤣   hope you dont get sued for changing their genders .

Karan is such a bloody cheater...first shraddha n then Jennifer....love u Jennifer Winget...

Lovely voice 💕💕
Is this is legal?

Kamal Hassan&#39;s and Kishore Kumar&#39;s info needs correction. Kamal Hassan didn&#39;t marry Srividya and Kishore married 4th time with Leena Chandavarkar.

Bad English. All mentioned have married the other for the third time or second time. Sounds ridiculous

For a man u should say his n not her

People don't have one marriage. Look at them.
Everyone has done PhD on marriage.
After Yogita Bali Kishore Kumar married Leena Chandravarkar.
English jumped off a chair and committed suicide. 😂

How about giving us a narration in Hindi instead?

Her ??..they r men

Why are you showing saif ali khan’s photo when nothing is stated about him in the video

Her ! Her ! HER!!!!

𝐒𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐬 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐡𝐢𝐝 𝐤𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐤𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐫 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬??
Why are you calling all the men “her”? Give the commentary in Hindi..then you dont have to worry about your lack of English grammar

Her😂😂😂😂.....for a man and everytime 😂😂

marriage has become a joke
There all men darling....

Your English is terrible and your voice is equally disturbing!  A man is him or his! A woman is her! These men also has 3 inch penises, so keeping a mate is challenging!

Her, Her, Her...

Her first wife ahhahahaa

Pls his for male and not her......sorry but i have to correct this......

May their souls rest in peace.

The ladies also got a lot of partners

Shit video
&#39;his&#39; wife... not &#39;her&#39; wife

kishore kumar, kabir bedi has not shown his name to adnan's wife jeba bakhtiyar for 4 centuries, he has not shown his saif to her for 4 centuries, he has made the second saari of 3 centuries to roja
I think adnan sami is Pakistani actor not from bollywood

Ek tho Salman ke liya chod dete..tho wo family mai busy hots or don na banta

But what about sanjay and rekha marriage in private

When you learn English, you speak to him….I speak Hindi very well.
Everyone's priest..
One thing to be noted men didn&#39;t get criticism as women when their marriage didn&#39;t work out. As shweta tiwari had to face many criticism instead of support even she faced domestic violence why double standards for male and female.

Kishorekumar married 4 times....name of 4th wife actress Lina Chandravakar.

All men but couldn&#39;t stop saying &quot;she&quot;

Kamal Haasan did not marry Srividya..it&#39;s wrong information thirdly he was in liv in with gauthami

Atrocious English
Good list ...update the English grammar part ...his is narrated as her in a lot of places

What kind of English is this.... horrible

Dirty Shahid's
Which is called Adultery according to Mark 10 in bible ...Jesus clearly defined marriage. I don&#39;t think they know this so therefore let God forgive them. Guys please read Mark 10 , pray to God get your partner from God forever. It is a commitment , which is the most powerful spiritual principle where God involved... Be careful

Kishor Kumar&#39;s 4th marriage with Leena Chandavarker is not mentioned.

Giving a dislike as the content does not match the cover pic.. cheap publicity...

Kamal didn&#39;t marry Srividya by its a wrong news

I haven&#39;t even changed my phone cover till now but look at them they have already changed their husbands and wives ....😂😂😂😅😄😊

Get your facts correct

When you are talking about men, please use the word “his” not “her”

He will marry some more

Horrible  Language. All the he&#39;s become shes. Terrible

Please correct your gender grammar in your commentary

Where is saif Ali Khan in video

Kamal dint married with Srividya ...

Need to learn to speak Sanjay is a man why r u referring to him as her

Kishor Kumar's fourth wife, Leena Chandravarkar, said that 4th Margie was finally successful, meaning that those who tried never failed.
You keep telling her instead his...

Lucky ali is really lucky   [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡ಠ_ಠ)̲̅$̲̅]
how about u know when to use Her and Him

I would love to know who she this silly goose egg calls &quot;mom &quot;

Why are you using &quot;her&quot; to refer men?

The &quot;her&quot; factor is really disturbing!

Saif Ali Khan had married only 2 times

Are you brother Saif Ali Khan where did you go?
Thumbnails  are misleading

Kamal didn&#39;t Marty to Srividya. First marriage was with Vani Ganapathi ,. Seconde one with Sarika. Third live in relationship with actress Gowthami. And other  affairs u can&#39;t list as he has so many.

It’s not her.. it’s his

Include leena chandavarkar... She is also in the list of kishore kumar&#39;s wives

The moment she said her to sanjay..I took U turn..🥴

Saif Ali Khan&#39;s wife details  kahan hai

Kamal married srividhya va....we are from Tamilnadu still we don&#39;t know that...he only just dating her

When you talk about men...say “he” not “her”.

English is &quot;her &quot;problem

Marrige is not a JOKE  i want too marrige only one time if you want tooo HIT LIKE ❤

First i though Sri Vidya as Sri Devi

Sorry Kamal haven&#39;t married srividya.he got married only 2 times and that too becoz first wife vaani cannot give him a baby.

Please fix grammar!!!

Kamal hassan did not marry Srividya🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ dont put the information that is not right
Horrid  pronoun &#39;her &#39; instead of his.

Please check your gender. Siddharth is a man not a lady. You have typed Siddharth got married to her school friend 🙄

00

Marriage is like fun for them.they take life as a game.

Kamina karan

You are wrong.Kishore Kumar had 5 wives

Liar liar pants on fire....
Kamal didn&#39;t marry Srividhya, his first wife was vaani ganapathy

Why are you changing the gender? Please correct your grammar.

His *

Its not her its his 1rst wife... please sort that out

Do you want to get married to me,  I agree.  For that you have to taste me first and then if we need each other more than once,  then we will think to get married.

“Sanjay lost ‘her’ first wife”... GURL PLEASE LEARN ENGLISH BEFORE REPORTING SOME NEWS.
Malieka ki buddhi gand boney Kapoor ne Marni Chahiye 😌

Woman/she/her Man/he/ his

Don&#39;t said stupidity about Kamal hassan. Where is his current wife gouthami

For these people, marriage is a joke..they love someone, sometimes they love someone..it is because of these people that the rest of the society gets spoiled.
What about Leeena chandravarkar? Wife of Kishore Kumar?

Him him him
They are referring to men as &quot;her&quot; !!!!!

Any child or any children LMAO her fan or his fan

I came here for saif ali khan... good trick to attract viewers

Your English is good but y are u changing their gender ya.... 😐

Please fix your English grammar.

Siddharth got married to ‘her’ girlfriend arthi bajaj?🤣

Why put saif ali khan photo then nonsense

Please check your grammar!!!!!! a Man marries his wife..... not her wife. It would make more sense for you to narrate this in Hindi correctly with the right grammar rather than speak in English with no grammar!!! It sounds terrible especially that the English close caption is also written wrong

Kamal married Sri Vidya?!!

Kamal did not marry Srividya at all!  You North Indians dunno anything hung right about South Indians, not even if they are Indian celebrities!

Kama Hassansir only married two times. Don&#39;t lie ok😡

Her???? I think you should learn some grammar

Kishore kumar got married to leena chandravarkar

People should learn how to speak English properly before commentating in English .. stick to Hindi it would sound better “ her “ instead of him several times 😂

agood

Really bad grammar !

You didn&#39;t show Kishor Kumar&#39;s 4th marriage

What is Saif Ali Khan's second wife like? You have put it with your pic 😡😡😡😡😡😡

Bakawas video

<b>”HER”</b> lol 😂

Kabir Bedi ...you stopped the count at 3rd wife ...what about the 4th one ?

Please grammar sudharo....&quot;her first wife &quot;

Why don't these people talk about marriage? They must be busy watching someone else's marriage, that's why all this is nonsense.
Karan singh grover was my crush few years back when his drama dil mil gye was on air but now hearing that he is a pervert he always ditch his wife and had many martial affairs im absolutely sure he can go for the 4th marriage after ditching bipashaa cause it in his blood i hate u karan

The narrator is not well versed in English....The grammar,  pronunciation,  intonations has all gone for a toss...

guys this page trash believe me

Kamal didn&#39;t marry srividhya.. they both love each other but not ended up in marriage

Can you please correct your English grammar ? And males are “he” and not “her”!

First learn English!

Hy Bhavan

For some bollywood  actor and actress  marriage are like games... They don&#39;t know how to keep relation together for lifetime... It is so sad to know that bollywood his becomeing soo bad for some actror and actress..

Dear lord... the grammar is abhorrent...

The error in the pronouns are super annoying.

3rd times a charm lmao 😂

its &quot;his&quot; not &quot;her&quot; (Sunjay Dutt and other guys)  . you are confusing the pronouns!

Wrong English usage in this video, it’s not ( got married to her Long time Friend ‘!! ( His ) Long time Friend !!

No Gender differentiation I see😂😂😂😂😂
First learn Speak to English should have said &quot;his&quot; not her😂

This reporter .... wow

Since I don't know about Kishore Kumar's real marriage life, why did I come to speak about it... Kishore Kumar married 4 people 1. Ruma Guha Thakurta, 2. Madhubala, 3. Yogita Bali and 4.Leena Chandavarkar
Bakwaa

Kamal garu vidya garu not marry ,

Zeba bakhtiar is very beautiful actress but she left Adnan sami because of his overweight

First of all, before anything else,RIP to her grammar.period.

<b>His</b>

Why doesn't English come to that much? Even people don't come to their language Hindi that well so it's okay. It's not a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. It was not clear to me what the person in front of me was. If the information is a little wrong then why should you write your love story or biography?

Richa did not die within 2 yrs of marriage..we know more than you.kishore kumar married 4 times.leena chandrwakar was his 4th wife

Kamal did not marry Srividya

Marriage is like a game for the actors unfaithful people

Wedded 😂

Zeba is our pakistani actress

That Kapil was not lake I am very Baad

Wtf  why you showing Saif Ali Khan&#39;s pic blsht

English has been butchers in this video. If not comfortable with English than switch to Hindi.

You seem to have trouble telling the difference between him and her, if a man marries his fan, it&#39;s not &#39;her &#39; fan it&#39;s &#39;his &#39;. You can email me for editing on your videos if you like, I really enjoy them 😁👍

Karan singh grover aur bollywood star😕hahaha what a joke😁

who’s this narrator who doesn’t know the difference between him and her?Please change her to someone who can speak proper English, she s making a fool of herself with her accent and stupidity

Sanjey lost her wife😂😂

<b>Why you put saif picture as tag to your video shym on your🤥</b>

Thats y shahid kapoor became a muslim

I thought jennifer winget was a good woman but she end up breaking others home. How can she be happy.. and also she wanted to revenge on bipasha 😑 she disappointed me

Please have someone else report your stories. Your journalistic delivery is really not attractive and I am not even talking about your Indian accent. The English is very poor for social media . It is very poor. There are lots of Indians who do this report justice. Hire someone else please.

You so focused on gossip that u forgot to focus on ur English 😂.

Its herrr???? Ohh I thought its him.What a blunder on YouTube upload..😂😂🤣😱🤬

Plz correct your English grammar its terrible the way you talk anything and post anything to spoil India&#39;s name regarding English. It&#39;s not even funny when you have no clue where to use HIM AND HER. Don&#39;t do a job if you are not suitable

Improve your English
😂😂😂😂  it&#39;s him not her .. Who else realized the mistake

Sreevidya and kamal..They are not married each other.....She is his girl frnd only...  ...They met  At the last time of sreevidyas death ,that was her last wish.

Fake video 😎

After Yogeeta Bali, Kishore Kumar again got married to Leena Chandavarkar in 1980. This was his 4th marriage.

Kishore Kumar 4th wife Leena u didn&#39;t mention.
