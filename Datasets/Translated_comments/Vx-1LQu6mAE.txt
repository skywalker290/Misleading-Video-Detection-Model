Back then, Böhmermann was still okay🤷‍♂️
While this sausage made inhumane comments about us unvaccinated people, is he now upset about a stinking finger? go ahead and cry! where... who actually pays for the garbage? Oh yes. &quot;small fee-financed loser show!&quot; How? We're the losers... sigh
Oh, those were the days when Greece was our biggest problem.🥲
I stumbled upon it again by chance after 8 1/2 years... Of course it was funny and entertaining even back then! On the other hand, the reactions back then make me sad, given today's technologies and fast pace.
For me, Böhmermann is and remains a useless man
Welcome to now
Böhmermann, stupid
I didn&#39;t know Malfoy works as a German TV host.

<a href="">2:44</a> how stupid they all are when they gossip and don't understand that they themselves are being made fun of
I love his laugh from <a href="">2:55</a> ... and the run-of-the-mill guy from the studio who claps afterwards xD
Nobody believed Yanis, then Jan came. Thank you
Oh yeah, the show was still good back then lol.
Jan Böhmermann has got balls, and is fucking hilarious, even when I don&#39;t understand what he is saying, he cracks me up. Now I have to learn German

Even if everyone thinks it's cool, it unfortunately led to the mass media relying on it and the average person even more hating the Greeks. Actually not particularly funny.
What is the red thing at minute <a href="">4:11</a> ? Is this a subliminal message like the Ammis back then with Join the Army?
Top!🤣
No glitch what's going on but looks pretty fun
Still great.
lol

At times he looks remarkably similar to Fresh Torge. Definitely here.
pathetic smear job, at the service of german bankers

A mature achievement 🤗
This clown &quot;understands&quot; Putin and is accused by female members of his party Diem25 of sexism, bullying and autocracy.

Brilliant!!

<a href="">5:48</a> red? Anyone else see that? but really good
Hammerhat, Jan simply has balls of steel
somehow reminds me of Pris0n Break - Lincoln Burr0ws
And no one notices that it's not the finger, but the index finger. Divine, this double joke 😂🙋‍♀️
You've all lost touch with reality. Böhmermann is once again triggering an international crisis, denigrating innocent people, costing millions and spreading lies with the help of a highly professional team. Among other things, he is blowing up democratically elected European government coalitions. This is the epitome of political propaganda disguised as funny satirical pranks. If Böhmermann didn't have a government contract, he would be in jail long ago. Hahaha
Those were still problems back then... 🤣
<a href="">5:21</a> top left, what a file name :D
Wow! That stuff was definitely more than two years ago! and I'm just finding out about it now?
I bow with a devilish smile🤣😈With one action the Bild editorial team and Greece got#####
Just seen. Should I now search in the comments for people who think you are fake so that Varoufakis is covered?
Europe destroyed twice and then completely offended by a finger.... Lol
A masterpiece
How do you get a connection to Croatia as a German? Answer: You just have to think about the Second World War 😅🤣😂🤣😅
public legal manure gieser....
What are the red frames in between? every time Böhmerman makes an empty comment?
Such a chatterbox, it's definitely not fake
Somehow the laughter and clapping seems a little out of place. Less is more.
<a href="">5:48</a> ?

What do these red screens mean?
We need actions like this again. Kind of over since you were adopted...

It's also fascinating how not a single person looked at the recordings where the original came from...

It's shocking that Günther Jauch can be called a journalist

Everyone: The ARD is serious.Really everyone: The ARD is serious.Jan Böhmermann: Hold my GEZ fees.
The one without fingers is definitely the fake video. The course of the hand movements is unnatural at this point
Absolutely awesome.
Thanks for recommending this to me after five years from YouTube. Thank you for showing me once again that there is a reason for the broadcasting fee.
ICH LACH MICH KAPUTT AN DER STELLE WO JAN LACHT WENN DIE NEBENAN ANFAENGT KROATISCH ZU SPRECHEN... BOGDINA HAHAHAHAH

How many actually know that Varoufakis actually gave the finger? The fake is the version without the finger.
I'm back here after 5 years and have completely forgotten about it. Böhmi has already brought so many crazy things...
The most important thing, which often goes unmentioned, is that Varoufakis was not yet a minister at the time, not a politician, not even in politics, and probably didn't even suspect that he would one day be a politician... That puts everything into perspective!!! Besides, giving the finger was the only right thing to do, it's a shame that he didn't do it and that not many more did it...
Even after 5 years, it's over for me every time the BILD expert gives his two cents... the guy must have crawled under the carpet afterwards.
It's also cool when the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing at ÖR Rundfunk.
But his statement isn't any better without the finger.
Still epic
Did someone call Böhmi to ask when they would do this “2020 prank”? dissolve?
You don't hear anything like that from Greece anymore, the country must be saved!
Can someone call him about Corona?
Super!

Did you create Greek subtitles??
If they had had the video examined by experts, they would definitely have found out. You can always tell whether a video has been edited.
Between <a href="">5:47</a> and <a href="">5:59</a> a red image is briefly displayed. I checked it, there is really only a red image.Between <a href ="">8:06</a> and <a href="">8:08</a> againJust a red image.
Hops taken.
made my decade
That's how it has to be, Jan Böhmermann is simply brilliant!
I always thought it was called Springer Presse because they were so quick to jump on anything that pointed to a news story that could be exploited.
&quot;stick the finger to Germany&quot; - you can probably still say that?!
This beautiful finger is awesome
What are those red jump scares? XD
What are all the red frames throughout the video?
Where is the second video where they say this was just a fake?😅
<a href="">7:52</a> once the first was either Serbia or Austria Hungary
What kind of humorless idiots actually give this a thumbs down?
For days no one knew what was real and what was fake. A masterpiece😄
We even did an intermediate section... with an index finger xDD
Lol, who else saw the red frame?
Did anyone notice the woman in the background at <a href="">7:36</a> who just disappears into the middle of the window? Coincidence? I don't believe.
The Show with the Mouse: That was Croatian.
I just think it's great how the imagery of the cesspool is drawn through the cocoa and then placed in front of its reflection. A great thumbs up to JAUCH, BILD and Co! Bravo Jan Böhmermann!
This is the most intellectual contribution in the history of NEO MAGAZIN ROYALE. Even the studio audience was completely fooled here. And to this day many people think you “fake your finger”.
What's with the red images that are played in between?
Does anyone else see the red flashes in the video or do I need to go to an ophthalmologist?
Croatian women are simply incredibly beautiful
2020 guys!!
2020

Who is still watching this in 2020? This should be shown in schools to distribute media literacy to everyone.
Wrapped up the golden middle finger?
Honor taken
What's unbelievable here is that a lot more thought was given to whether the middle finger was real or not than to what was actually important. It was done through the cheapest denunciation (two years!! before the talk show there was the video, and it was clearly here not about degrading the Germans) simply a video clip with an alleged insult taken out of context and thus accrediting the political stance of an elected politician. What was he supposed to say two years later? A video with a comparable “denunciation factor” exists elsewhere too. Why was it used here? Since Varoufakis actually had a lot of knowledge about economics and was difficult to refute with arguments, it is of course easier to continue to contradict him, but with outrageous arguments, instead of proving him right. Böhmermann's brilliant contribution was also that the debate then turned around gave the middle finger, and enlightened people may have realized how insane this middle finger is and how little it has to do with the whole thing, but how much it was placed at the center of the debate. Everyone talks about whether it's real or not, whether Böhmermann did it or not, but we shouldn't actually ask ourselves that because the middle finger is irrelevant to the discussion
Age! With Greek subtitles.🤣
Pretty deep
Was Bömi young then? Günter looks exactly the same as he does today😂
great, thanks to the NEO MAGAZIN ROYALE team
Varoufakis and the fucking fake fuck finger

Someone named Whyfuckis isn't supposed to have shown the middle finger?
Who still watches this shit in 2019??? 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😍❤️
Legend
Crazy 👌
This is still EPIC. This is just so awesome. A piece of television history!
What is the very short fade-in at <a href="">5:47</a> (Edit: and <a href="">9:00</a>)???????
The destruction of Günther Jauch
What works with diaries...
<a href="">4:11</a> I wasn't that fast
The grin when the lady starts speaking Croatian... Wonderful!!!! RESPECT! ..just RESPECT!
Funny and cool towards the media landscape as well as the purpose of attracting attention and popularity. However, the fact that a topic is used for this purpose where people in Greece sometimes have to eat the lime from the walls and someone who actually represents them democratically exploits it for their own ends evades any satire.
Does Jauch have a reaction to the fake?
why are some red images included? :/
Bruh
What's with the frame at <a href="">4:10</a> where the whole image is red?
Sue the Bavarian state parliament (no joke)
In between there were individual red frames, what does that mean? Or is that just the cut screen?
Yes, that's Photoshop Phillip, he's not that good with people.
The fake video is on the left 😊
The fake of a fake - simply brilliant
Why is there a completely red screen at <a href="">4:11</a>?! For just a fraction of a second, definitely come. Brainwashing hahahah.
His humor is simply too complicated for all the German humor-impaired people.
To this day I don't know whether he gave the finger or not.
<a href="">6:10</a> This is our material - the original material. Hmmmmmmmmmm
Broadcasting fees are well spent.
Deep Fake bevor Deep Fake Mainstream wurde.
He's evil and I love that
Why does a red image pop 1, 2 seconds before at <a href="">08:06</a> in just a few seconds? previously?
A STAR HOUR of German satire!
More relevant than ever? :D
The frame at 04m 11s 520ms is red.<a href="">4:10</a>
And today, 4 years later, Austria is burning and the probability that Mr. Böhmermann also orchestrated this is not that unlikely 😅
<a href="">04:11</a> ???

Who noticed the red screen at <a href="">4:12</a>?
BAM!

:&#39;D

Main

Am I the only one who noticed the red frame?
Those were the days when Böhmermann was a slob and troublesome. Now he is a slick, politically correct mainstream propagandist on the hunt for the Saturday 8:15 p.m. slot on ZDF. Just don't offend, just don't express opinions that are unpopular. Shame.
I'm only looking at this in 2019, but kudos to the dude who installed the finger so nicely - he needs a raise!
The tie is awesome, where can you get it :O
People laugh. But it's crazy how fake news can work.
Was it really faked back then or did they just claim to have faked it and labeled this as "real"? sold material faked? I'm confused
<a href="">7:36</a> was war das??

In my opinion, the editor with After Effects deserves the greatest praise.
Neo Magazine: The only show that follows through on its announcements and doesn't shy away from work.
<a href="">5:48</a> What's that red screen in the middle?
Even if he had shown his finger - so what? As long as he doesn't start a world war, it seems to get on the nerves of the Germans. There are crazy people running around here every week, dragging gallows, calling our head of state a lizard man to be shot down and a top chemtrail sprayer - that's all Freedom of expression...But woe betide anyone in Greece who thinks German politics is shit - that's unacceptable...
What's with the short red frames at <a href="">5:48</a>, <a href="">8:06</a> and <a href="">9:01 </a> on yourself?
What is shown in the individual frames? I'm too lazy to figure it out myself.
:) &lt;3

at least as good as the daughter-in-law-wanted fake...... :D
Why does Jan still look so young?! It's only been three years 😁
Luckily Germany didn't see this as an invitation to start World War 3, phew
<a href="">5:48</a> what was that?
<a href="">

What is actually written in the mostly short red pictures?
I've been an atheist all my life, but I just had an encounter with <a href="">God. That's how people must have felt in the time of Jesus. Then out of nowhere comes this pale, thin boy and simply shaves worldviews as if they were sacks of hair ;-( .
Didn't it come out afterwards that the stinky finger was actually real and the other videos with the index finger and without the hand were fake? 😂😂
I still celebrate that. This should really go down in fairy history and be written in every school textbook about how easily people can be manipulated.
The Greeks are driving their country to the wall and mentally giving the finger to those, us, who support them financially. I find that exciting.
It's funny what the Germans have fun with.


Varoufakis says: “Greece is bankrupt and it is completely impossible for Greece to pay back this debt. It is now necessary for the creditors (i.e. the German and French banks) to sit down with the Greek government and discuss a haircut. Everything else is delaying bankruptcy. This approach is common in the market economy. The banks must be prepared for a haircut because they have been demanding higher interest rates from Greece for years precisely because the repayment of the debt was at risk. It cannot therefore be the case that the German taxpayer is now footing the bill.”


Varoufakis is demanding that the banks take their share of responsibility and that German taxpayers are not led to believe that they will see their money again at some point. He was beaten up by the German press for this. That is really funny!
Greece would have to give us all of its land and we'll turn it into Marllorca 2.0, right? Or we make the world's largest nudist beach?
Subliminal messaging. nice one

The GEZ is finally worth it
I&#39;m watching a Greek guy speaking in English, dubbed over in German, watching this with Greek subs so I can understand.

Is the fake now real or is the fake fake real? I'm not coming with you anymore
This actually shows perfectly how manipulative we are :3
He gave us the finger. Off to war against Greece!
Masterpiece! Great. This is the quintessence of media criticism and the answer to all legitimate doubts about the GEZ contribution. As long as there is Böhmermann who puts the fee recipients, i.e. his bosses, in their place, the money is very well spent. If he were on a private infomercial channel, it would of course be easy for him to raise his finger. But sometimes he's in his own seat and you can't really make media more credible
I find Böhmermann impossible!
I cannot share the enthusiasm for this fake. At a time when relations between Germany and Greece are already under strain, a fake video like this is nothing more than adding fuel to the fire. For some this might be funny. For me it isn't. I was very excited at the time. And I'm not the only one who was stupid enough to think this video was real. I wonder whether Mr. Böhmermann would also find it funny if he were shown in a video montage, for example, showing the Hitler salute with the corresponding comment "Böhmermann caught in the front line at a Nazi demo." would publish on the Internet. Will there be anyone else who dares to publicly doubt this video?
What's that red flickering at <a href="">05:47</a>? Is that just a cut or a reference to the picture? :D
Whenever I have a low, I look at it lol and then I just feel better
It's funny but, now look at what the Wikipedia article says about Varoufakis (<a href=""> So it's still not clear whether the video was real, or in other words his reputation was massively damaged. It's kind of creepy what a joke like that can do.
You can see that it is possible to make people believe anything. Welcome to everyday life!
2018? :)

You are the best Böhmermann; )
<a href="">7:35</a> The Battlefield 4 Tashgar music in the background is awesome!!!
<a href="">4:10</a> what is the red one
My left arm is currently masturbating to this awesomeness :D
I found it extremely funny, but isn't that character assassination somewhere?
Ask investigative questions!
ATTENTION ATTENTION the Stingefinger was sold again as a real one and was just shown on ZDF because of the Greece issue, no to mass control
Cool. The ZDF news also uses the fake video in 2018. (06/22/2018)<a href="">#fail</a>
Does anyone know what that is at <a href="">4:11</a>? A red frame flickers through briefly
Photoshop-Phillip was at work ;)
Why does the image turn red at <a href="">04:11</a>?!!! This happens just at the moment when Böhmermann &quot;stick&quot; says. If you slow down the video drastically, from a slowdown of 1/88 you can see that this red frame is not just a frame. In fact, all 818 pages of the two volumes of Hitler's "Mein Kampf" are displayed in this section, which can be seen from a slowdown to 1/25000 (then: around 1 page per second). Due to an interaction between a monitor's insufficient hertz rate and our limited visual perception, this flood of knowledge merges into the color red in a fraction of a second, which is due to the color spectrum of additive color mixing. At the same time, however, it succeeds in conveying a subliminal message to the viewer, because “Mein Kampf” stands for &quot;right&quot; and red is the color of communism (“left”). The NEO MAGAZIN ROYAL and the entire state broadcasting community of ARD and ZDF are under the control of the lobbies who use them as their puppets to convey their Masonic thinking by converting society into "LEFT". and &quot;RIGHT&quot; columns. The word &quot;stick&quot; at this point, it doesn't mean "stretch out your finger", but actually "baton". or &quot;control stick&quot; to subconsciously suggest to the viewer that they have no real freedom of choice and can only be controlled by others. This is what it looks like folks. Finger in the bottom Mexico!!!!
wow, the German press couldn't even manage to give more than 1039 dislikes on this video...shame on you...you're otherwise so effective. It's a shame that there aren't more campaigns like this and thanks to Neo Magazin Royale for them good work
Well, in the past we would have just marched in. ;-)
<a href="">5:48</a> why does that picture turn red
<a href="">4:11</a> ?

I didn't realize it was a fake... so I thought it was real until just now... Oh my God :-D
What is the red thing at <a href="">4:11</a>?
Damn that's awesome!!!
The video is real and he didn't fake it, I didn't even notice.
Why is the screen completely red in some frames?
ALTER :D

Croatian women are absolutely beautiful!
I can't see any fun in it all anymore. In my opinion, using such practices in a tense political situation is a case for the public prosecutor. Even though it was years ago, for me it's just proof of how western media are doing fake news. Yes exactly. Western media only do targeted fake news anymore. I can also remember the Russian soldier after the downing of MH17 in Ukraine, standing brutally with the teddy bear in his hand, with the headline in the Western propaganda newspaper: "These Russian Beasts don't stop at anything." The film accompanying this photo shows a very affected person who crosses himself and places the teddy bear on a mound of earth. That opened my eyes to the fact that you can no longer simply believe a single word of our Western media. Everything that is shown and written here has to be questioned three times and followed up in other places! It's a disgrace, you Western reporters, that at least 75% of the reports only do copy+paste. Plus a good portion of film editing and taking photos out of context. The main thing is that you earn your salary, no matter how or who you cause problems with it.
It's hard to believe it's been 3 years already...
<a href="">5:47</a> what kind of red picture is that?😂
My heart hurts &quot;Matches in the pool&quot; to be heard in such a context 😖
I didn't even realize that Böhmi had faked it!!! BRILLIANT!!!
And how do you explain the fact that the video SkriptaTV, which covers the subversive festival every year uploaded a video of his talk, which clearly shows that he gave the middle finger?<a href=""> would buy what you are saying if the video was uploaded by some nameless account or some other source and not the youtube channel of a community that clearly promotes Varoufakis and his agenda.

But it's shocking that something like this happens so easily and everyone thinks you're wondering what else is being faked...
Speaking of asking... Was it you with the NSA scandal? Snowden is fake right?

What kind of frame is that at <a href="">4:10</a> and <a href="">5:53</a>?
I believed that myself now
A false fake - the finger video is actually real!
Was that really fake? Did he give the finger or not? Or is this satire? I don't see it.
what's going on at min <a href="">4:11</a> this red frame?
What is that red image at 5.48
<a href="">4:11</a> this is just an image error, nothing hidden, just a red image. :&gt;

Oh wie fucking geil
Jan Böhmermann is a hero. Holding a mirror in front of the Germans' faces is great!
Jan Böhmermann should write “The Hidden Fake News” in the future. moderate.
Why is there a brief red flickering at <a href="">5:48</a>?
2 years later and I'm still not sure if it was a fake in a fake or notXD
I just enlightened myself today and watched the video xD
Next Level Shit
If they had only shown the index finger variant and not exaggerated it so much, ads would probably have passed
Is it now the case that the fake was a fake? Böhmermann: &quot;Dear editorial team from Günther Jauch. Yanis Varoufakis is wrong. You didn't fake the video. You simply took the video out of context and dragged a Greek politician around the studio by the finger. So that mom and dad can get excited again in the evening after the crime scene: 'The foreigner! Get out of Europe with him! He is poor and takes our Germans' money. That probably doesn't exist. We are the bosses here! Like that!&#39; You did that. And the rest is ours." Confusing! Brilliant!
The index finger is real. Otherwise the origin of the file was not shown anywhere.
Günter Lauch
More please
I'm Greek, I've been learning German for 2 years and that's why I wanted to say something in German so that everyone can understand German. First of all, sorry for my mistakes. All of us Greeks know that Varoufakis is a funny person. We don't take him seriously. Unfortunately, this person was our economics minister and we are ashamed because of Varoufakis (umlaut). Since it's obvious that Varoyfakis has his fuck fingers raised...
And how did they make the original video disappear? It would have been exposed straight away if someone had seen it
Now almost 2 years later it is still divine. It's so telling how we deal with Greece. We destroy an entire economy and then know how to get upset.
I love you
Varoufake, Erdogan &amp; Germany Second 😂 Böhmermann leads me more towards the TV world again 👌
After almost 2 years, thanks to the fake news debate, it's hot again.
can you do something like that with trump? Would like to know which media do good research and have learned what from it, and which don't? I think many people would jump at it
No TV show is safe with Neo Magazine Royal 😁😂
Is the finger real or fake?
Even the grin at the beginning😂😏
It wasn't the finest Greek manner, but the man is and remains a politician for the people. Look at the crap we have here, they aren't politicians in my eyes.
These red cut frames hurt my eyes
geni(t)al

HAHAHA The subtitles :D
how cool
Now seriously! What program did you use to do this? I have to have it!!!
bravo!

<a href="">2:47</a> Is there actually a scarier smile than Jan's? I think it's okay, but to be honest it's not really amusing...
Jan is also a Trololo! There are serious topics that should not be ridiculed. The situation in Greece is not worth joking about. Because it is the fault of the 16 Eurobanks that the situation is like this. Deutsche Bank has taken a healthy approach and, as a media, supported the theft from the Greek people. That's not funny. Especially if you're so stupid and don't know that Greece was the most economically productive country in Europe until 2008. 30,000usd per capita per year GDP. Only Germany has more with GDP per capita of USD 40,000. So shut up and make fun of real monkeys who don't want to work. Erdogan was quite suitable.
Jauch is an idiot! And bottom drawer of journalism...you should sue Jauch for that. The bad thing is how many idiots have fallen for it and become abusive. How many apologized afterwards? Yep, not ZDF, not anyone.. Scandalous moves that fit well into the agitation of the German media. Tasteless
This Croatian woman is very beautiful.
That was Croatian XD
no, how cool!
The middle finger is real. - Seen from <a href="">6:30</a> on the right picture at the position of the middle finger, we find light fall-off from the headlight on the lower palm on the shirt - this is in the left picture (supposedly synchronous ) not found. In addition, it is much easier to loop a hand movement than to fit an entire arm into it. - But I'm looking forward to more from you!
Salty germans trying to ruin the career of the greatest man alive

Can someone tell me whether the middle finger or the hand is fake?! 😅
Sanja is pretty &lt;3
Well, that escalated quickly ¯\(ツ)/¯

Look what the file is called. :D <a href="">5:09</a>
Congratulations Neo Magazine Royale, your varufake was just picked up by <a href="">welt.de</a> as "the politician who was the last to use the finger".
For those who still don't understand, Varoufakis really gave the middle finger during his speech. The genius of Böhmermann and his team is making us believe that they are behind it. Think twice about what you believe
AfD pro

Glad you clarified that just in time for the debate! This way no misunderstandings arose. Imagine you are editing a video of Angela Merkel doing the Hitler salute. after she was voted out and her career was &quot;destroyed&quot; is they say 2 years later that it was all just a social experiment and we laugh together.........and you still celebrate the shit.

I find it fascinating and frightening at the same time what and how everything can be distorted. But the Böhmermann boys &amp; You have to give respect to girls, after all the USA can't even properly fake waffles of mass destruction in photos
Excellent! And very educational...
Yap

and Varoufakis recorded it exactly as it was intended: as a successful joke 🤘
Does anyone really know whether they did it and Varofakis was telling the truth, or whether they took his video and retouched the middle finger? I vaguely remember them claiming the latter on Facebook shortly afterwards
The fake is damn well done, I have to admit. But what exactly was the point of it? I mean, faking isn't exactly a new invention from NEO MAGAZINE. But the main thing is to stick the moral finger again at the end. Do more investigative articles like exposing wife swapping, I really liked that. Especially because there was a lot of effort behind it and at least it has real... value, if I may say so.
Does anyone know which song starts at <a href="">7:13</a>?

What exactly does this friend of the author (at <a href="">3:57</a>) have to do with it? Why did they need a connection to Croatia?
but but but it was in public law... that MUST be true
Hahahaha, that was just a brilliant prank^^ Hats off^^
Still simply brilliant. Rightly won the Grimme Prize!
Sanja P...I have a huge crush on me :)
böhmefhufensohn wait until I see you on the street then I would like to thank you very much.
Digital video footage has long since lost its evidentiary value...
Big moment in TV history! Delicious...
would like to know if Varoufakis has already seen the video :)

It's so awesome

+neomagazinroyale when will there be another episode of television help?
<a href="">5:48</a>

<a href="">#adobe</a> cs6 <a href="">#100Prozent</a> echt (zwinker)
And there's a GRIM PRIZE for something like that. Congratulations
WHAT A @@hole! .... dangerous and irresponsible low educated inhuman being! ... wars could begin from this kinda of stupidity! OUTRAGEOUS!

But... we've already been to the moon... right?
A year later and Böhmi has another Grimme Prize for this stroke of genius.
Wow, a post without English sentences from JB, I'm impressed.
<a href="">#GrimmePreis</a>
I still have to laugh about it, especially at the fact that Jan Böhmermann is honestly happy the whole time and is laughing his head off inside like a rascal. Fantastic.
It's just a good thing that the editorial team reads the comments section more often. Shortly before this hype, I remember leaving an 8-line line as a "sketch." The stinking finger was supposed to make you powerful, but I also mentioned that versions with pointing and victory fingers would be possible :-) It's impressive that the editorial team has finally decided on the stinking finger!
GRIMME PREIS !!!!11EINSELF!!!iii!!

<a href="">4:11</a> Totally red (pause)
It was probably a prank that they faked this middle finger
Splendid!
I don't understand the red frames that were cut in...
Has anyone else seen the ghost at <a href="">7:35</a> that just disappears like that? :O
:&#39;D hahaha too awesome I love you Böhmermann ^^
Humor, humor. Laughs, come on now! Humor, humor!
Now again for stupid people. Which video is fake and which is real? :DB but half got out
What is the name of the program they used for the forgery? Ps. Great action
What is the name of the program they used for the forgery? Ps. Great action
Genius!
That's cool! XD
And I would like to kiss the entire editorial team for such actions. Come on, take my GEZ fees.
Even after more than half a year, this video still inspires me.
That's why never take pictures seriously......media is corrupt!
Why is there suddenly a red frame in the video at <a href="">4:11</a>?
I have police!
Focus is actually publishing an article today in which it points to the middle finger video as a reputable source: <a href="">
"If it's on Jauch" But how can he know that Jauch will show it if he's only shot it?
Yes, you only get such hot shit from the public ones, the private ones don't do it because they don't have any balls
I don't pay any GEZ, but it would actually be worth it. I am applying immediately for a job advertisement as a recognized internet expert. I can even recognize fake orgasms in pornographic videos.
Big applause for the work. Rarely have I seen anything so good
Böhmi, you devil
Haha!

Am I the only one trying to understand why the video included a red image at around <a href="">4:11</a>?
Günther Jauch is a money-hungry scumbag who has as much to do with journalism as a prostitute has with a modest lifestyle. The hammer was, of course, Mr. Elitz, who couldn't imagine that an RTL asshole could simply distribute fake videos on his show... Well, Mr. Elitz, you can see that you also work for a dirty broadcaster (ARD). ...Whether Mr. Jauch and Mr. Elitz apologized to Mr. Varoufakis? Yep, the name said it all...
The problem is that the German people as well as everyone else has been duped into thinking that the Greek people will get any of the &quot;loans&quot; - It is all going back to the German banks and others that have made shitty decisions on Greek loans. The German government have decided to make the German people pay if their banks crack. so now they have all decided that the poorest people in EU must pay for their bad decisions. The irony is that the most intelligent economist in Greece who showed them a solution now has been demonized and kicked of the Greek team. And he was the one that was pro EU.   How dumb was that?

How does german girls smell? if you call a fuck finger eine stinkefinger
I thought that something cool would appear at <a href="">4:10</a> and then it would just be red.
Varoufakis is well respected and when I say this, I mean at an international level. This video is nothing more than a doctored anti Greece propaganda tool. 

Well, I have to honestly say it's so complex that I no longer know what is fake and what isn't. Well, in any case, it is once again clear how manipulative the media is. Nevertheless, I would like an answer as to what ultimately is the message that Mr. Böhermann wants to send here. It would be nice if someone could help me with that.
dear mr varoufakis congretulation to your resignation Chapeau! I'm showing the world my stinking finger, including Günther Jauch! Greetings Birgit, now am I going to get sued?
SO FEIERBAR!

EVEN ITS FAKE ITS REAL TO ME FUCK GERMANY ASSHOLES 

Quoting: &quot;Just ignore the dumb Germans who hate on Greeks - they are total losers who propably watch scripted reality shows and have no idea what&#39;s actually going on in the world.&quot; --&gt; LOL actually that is true. Germans watch all the time scripted reality shows on TV - with lowest quality ever., Germans are very simple people, they dont understand anything about economy or politics.

At <a href="">02:42</a> you could already see that he noticed that the audience didn't recognize the sarcasm :&#39;D
hmmm The finger must have been there first to make it disappear, right? ;-)
russia and greece brothers fuck europe

Great work!
Once again. It&#39;s your fault,  bitchermann. You kicked the minister of awesome. 

You kicked out the minister of awesome. Great work, idiot.

Thank you, Böhmerdepp. You kicked the Greek Minister of awesome.

OOHHHH EVEN IF HE DIDNT,ALL GREEKS WE STICK MANYYYY FINGERSS NOT TO GERMANY,NOT TO GERMAN PEOPLE,BECAUSE WE LOVE AND RESPECT THEM,BUT.............. TO GERMAN GOVERMENT !!!!!!!!!! AWW THATS FOR SURE,AND PERSOLNALY TO MERKEL,EJNOY IT ANGELA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A <i>Der Spiegel</i> article about Germany.  <b>EVERY European should MOST DEFINITELY read. </b>DER SPIEGEL: <i>&#39;Germany Was Biggest Debt Transgressor of 20th Century&#39;</i>Think Greece&#39;s current economic malaise is the worst ever experienced in Europe? Think again.  Germany.  economic historian Albrecht Ritschl argues in a SPIEGEL ONLINE interview.  has been the worst debtor nation of the past century.  He warns the country should take a more chaste approach in the euro crisis or it could face renewed demands for World War II reparations.  <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Mr.  Ritschl.  Germany is coming across like a know-it-all in the debate over aid for Greece.  Berlin is intransigent and is demanding obedience from Athens.  Is this attitude justified?<b>Ritschl</b>: No.  there is no basis for it. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Most Germans would likely disagree. <b>Ritschl</b>: That may be.  but during the 20th century.  Germany was responsible for what were the biggest national bankruptcies in recent history.  It is only thanks to the United States.  which sacrificed vast amounts of money after both World War I and World War II.  that Germany is financially stable today and holds the status of Europe&#39;s headmaster.  That fact.  unfortunately.  often seems to be forgotten. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: What happened back then exactly?<b>Ritschl</b>: From 1924 to 1929.  the Weimar Republic lived on credit and even borrowed the money it needed for its World War I reparations payments from America.  This credit pyramid collapsed during the economic crisis of 1931.  The money was gone.  the damage to the United States enormous.  the effect on the global economy devastating. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: The situation after World War II was similar. <b>Ritschl</b>: But right afterwards.  America immediately took steps to ensure there wouldn&#39;t be a repeat of high reparations demands made on Germany.  With only a few exceptions.  all such demands were put on the backburner until Germany&#39;s future reunification.  For Germany.  that was a life-saving gesture.  and it was the actual financial basis of the Wirtschaftswunder.  or economic miracle (that began in the 1950s).  But it also meant that the victims of the German occupation in Europe also had to forgo reparations.  including the Greeks. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: In the current crisis.  Greece was initially pledged €110 billion from the euro-zone and the International Monetary Fund.  Now a further rescue package of similar dimensions has become necessary.  How big were Germany&#39;s previous defaults?<b>Ritschl</b>: Measured in each case against the economic performance of the USA.  the German debt default in the 1930s alone was as significant as the costs of the 2008 financial crisis.  Compared to that default.  today&#39;s Greek payment problems are actually insignificant. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: If there was a list of the worst global bankruptcies in history.  where would Germany rank?<b>Ritschl</b>: Germany is king when it comes to debt.  Calculated based on the amount of losses compared to economic performance.  Germany was the biggest debt transgressor of the 20th century. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Greece can&#39;t compare?<b>Ritschl</b>: No.  the country has played a minor role.  It is only the contagion danger for other euro-zone countries that is the problem. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: The Germany of today is considered the embodiment of stability.  How many times has Germany become insolvent in the past?<b>Ritschl</b>: That depends on how you do the math.  During the past century alone.  though.  at least three times.  After the first default during the 1930s.  the US gave Germany a &quot;haircut&quot; in 1953.  reducing its debt problem to practically nothing.  Germany has been in a very good position ever since.  even as other Europeans were forced to endure the burdens of World War II and the consequences of the German occupation.  Germany even had a period of non-payment in 1990. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Really? A default?<b>Ritschl</b>: Yes.  then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl refused at the time to implement changes to the London Agreement on German External Debts of 1953.  Under the terms of the agreement.  in the event of a reunification.  the issue of German reparations payments from World War II would be newly regulated.  The only demand made was that a small remaining sum be paid.  but we&#39;re talking about minimal sums here.  With the exception of compensation paid out to forced laborers.  Germany did not pay any reparations after 1990 -- and neither did it pay off the loans and occupation costs it pressed out of the countries it had occupied during World War II.  Not to the Greeks.  either. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Unlike in 1953.  the current debate in Germany over the rescue of Greece is concerned not so much with a &quot;haircut&quot;.  but rather an extension of the maturities of government bonds.  i. e.  a &quot;soft debt restructuring. &quot; Can one therefore even speak of an impending bankruptcy?<b>Ritschl</b>: Absolutely.  Even if a country is not 100 percent out of money.  it could still be broke.  Just like in the case of Germany in the 1950s.  it is illusory to think that Greeks would ever pay off their debts alone.  Those who are unable to do that are considered to be flat broke.  It is now necessary to determine how high the failure rate of government bonds is.  and how much money the country&#39;s creditors must sacrifice.  It&#39;s above all a matter of finding the paymaster. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: The biggest paymaster would surely be Germany. <b>Ritschl</b>: That&#39;s what it looks like.  but we were also extremely reckless -- and our export industry has thrived on orders.  The anti-Greek sentiment that is widespread in many German media outlets is highly dangerous.  And we are sitting in a glass house: Germany&#39;s resurgence has only been possible through waiving extensive debt payments and stopping reparations to its World War II victims. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: You&#39;re saying that Germany should back down?<b>Ritschl</b>: In the 20th century.  Germany started two world wars.  the second of which was conducted as a war of annihilation and extermination.  and subsequently its enemies waived its reparations payments completely or to a considerable extent.  No one in Greece has forgotten that Germany owes its economic prosperity to the grace of other nations. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: What do you mean by that?<b>Ritschl</b>: The Greeks are very well aware of the antagonistic articles in the German media.  If the mood in the country turns.  old claims for reparations could be raised.  from other European nations as well.  And if Germany ever had to honor them.  we would all be taken the cleaners.  Compared with that.  we can be grateful that Greece is being indulgently reorganized at our expense.  If we follow public opinion here with its cheap propaganda and not wanting to pay.  then eventually the old bills will be presented again. <b>SPIEGEL ONLINE</b>: Looking at history.  what would be the best solution for Greece -- and for Germany?<b>Ritschl</b>: The German bankruptcies in the last century show that the sensible thing to do now would be to have a real reduction of the debt.  Anyone who has lent money to Greece would then have to give up a considerable part of what they were owed.  Some banks would not be able to cope with that.  so there would have to be new aid programs.  For Germany.  this could be expensive.  but we will have to pay either way.  At least Greece would then have the chance to start over. 

And people still think the ISIS beheadings were real. How naive. Who&#39;s payroll were these guys on? Wait, never mind, lets just fake an NSA paycheck.

it still is hilarious!!!!and gives Garoufakis more prestige if he would really have given the finger if we take it as a joke.tyvm for sharing!!!!! :)

Greek - nothing know, nothing do, nothing can  -  but all need money.

schock!!! also kein yanis varouFUCKTHIS???? geiles video xD

Let&#39;s also forget about this as well: <a href="">

Apparently people don't understand that the middle finger is real and that Das Neo Magazine is satirically portraying itself as the creator of this video. With this campaign, Jan Böhmerman has finally arrived at the Comedyolümp. It's simply brilliant how carelessly people believe this satire by Jan Böhmerman to be true.
Go to Italy, Turkey, Spain and wherever you like. The Greek people do not want you. Do not you ashamed?

Huge mistake of Greece to be sucked into a compound with such a people. What do we have with criminals?

This is better than Blamielen or kasielen :D
Thank you Mr Böhmermann! Just what you say from <a href="">8:12</a> explains pretty well what contributes to this hateful right-wing mood in the country.
I only found out about the “Juice &amp;” podcast. Carefully&quot; It's clear that the finger was really cheated on Jan's initiative!<del>RESPECT</del>It's already been written, but I'm happy to repeat: I'm happy to pay fees FOR THAT!
I'm still celebrating the video :D
Genial !!
Whaooo amazing german job seen from france with a great laught !

I'm sitting in front of my laptop completely confused. What the f*CK is really right now can someone enlighten me quickly...?
Since this is one of the most viewed videos here and receives a lot of attention, I would like to ask a question here. A lot of Germans claim (mostly on television, but also ordinary people in surveys) that they are slowly fed up with the government, that it is so cheeky and disrespectful etc etc. Can someone please give me an example? All I know is that Varoufakis told Disjelblom or whatever his name is that Greece does not want to cooperate with such an anti-European association as the Troika. And now? What else have they done that is so bad that they would be called naughty?? I would really be interested.
Do not come for holidays in Greece this year. Why not go to another country to have a holiday because you know that the Greeks do not want you. You have no dignity?

Why is there a J Dilla figure on the desk?
Great ! fantastish ! you ridiculize serious journalists so easily to demonstrate their incompetence, thx

There is no Nwo government in power in Greece. At least it is doing something for its country in contrast to our government. Traitors like Jauch are not Germans.
Respect Jan! Well done!
Germans should get serious after all, they are under ocupation.Keep fooling to distract the population and we know how easy it is to distract Germans.  You need to work toward peace.

At the same time though, the German sentiment that it&#39;s other countries paying for Greece is something which can be felt in a majority of the European member states. It&#39;s not uniquely German.I think it&#39;s just something which will continue to exist, even within member states there&#39;s a feeling of discontent when tax money goes to the economically less strong members (look at Flanders vs Wallonia (Belgium), North of Italy vs South, Scotland vs England, etc).

You should not be surprised if you end up in court facing charges of defamation of character.

A fist in the ass of the entire German media! Brilliant!
I DON'T WANT TO PAY FEES for such stupid stuff.
I can't understand the humor in this show at all, what Mr. Böhmermann said from <a href="">8:08</a> absolutely sums it up!
Sorry German you want to rent my villa while you bail me out lol <a href="">

Sois los mejores trolls que he visto. XD Congrats for demonstrate the media`s lies!

I like cheese
The Croatian assistant is beautiful! and the Böhmermann looks sweet as sugar.
WTF :-D This needs to be celebrated
The point with the finger is fake! But what is true is that many Germans want the Greeks out of the Eurozone so that they can continue to benefit from the Euro in a selfish way! Nazi thinking is very important in Europe! Want to have everything but just don't know how to share, so this may be banned for the third time. Well, Reichsmarks would be the right coin for these relic-minded people. But it's important to know that I'm NOT generalizing here.
Bravo :D

Best part is this video worked like a charm for both sides.Since it made some Greeks like V even more and exposed German policy in the eyes of Europe.So even if it was intended to be funny it worked better than expected

But the fake is also fake? hahahaBut well Jan is better than all of YouTube by the way
RTL television for Hartz IV receivers...
Danke!

hahahaha.... a triple ..|.. to the mainstream matrix media. Well, if soooo many people hadn't seen through the fraud with the GEZ fees and stopped paying, you could maybe afford a real expert. So I agree with your spiritual role model Benjamin Blümchen.....TÖÖÖRÖÖÖÖÖÖ... TRÖÖÖÖÖT :D
&quot;.... Europe has been devastated twice in a century, but when they give us the finger we freak out!!!!....&quot; ...
Well, so far nothing, but absolutely nothing, has come from Tsipras, Varoufakis and colleagues to overcome the crisis in Greece. The internal structures and processes in Greece must be quickly and radically checked for waste and corruption and corrected.
Very cool, it shows that many formats are not about truth, but about campaigns and creating opinions and creating a mood.
And I still firmly believe that Böhmermann is Tom Felton's German twin brother.
Now I just have to get something off my chest! Jan Böhmermann's work is definitely great for the older German citizen, simply because most of them don't go to YouTube and watch videos of great YouTubers! However, I notice that the honored Mr. Böhmermann has many formats as well as ideas for videos and short clips from major German and American YouTubers! Plus, he insults a lot of them! They mention these insults in their video clips and Jan Böhmermann gets half a million more clicks on his videos! Ultimately, I don't care what you think of this comment! I just wanted to bring it to your attention!
And even if he had given the finger... It was an indirect speech.Anyone who would watch the whole video would understand that he wasn&#39;t giving the finger to anyone. Great montaz though.

Geeeeenial!!! 😆
Then you don't have to wear a gas mask on the bivouac because you don't want it to be infected too :-)
Preferably everything at once military service opium and conjunctivitis with hand-stubbed shaking as an alibi!
or you hear entry door handles in Bundeswehr barracks contaminated with conjunctivitis germs. Or become a subtenant in an opium den in the Ruhr area!
Well, trolls don't need a cerebral manipulator to get red eyes. All you need is a CRT monitor and 1g of cannabis on a holiday evening 3!
Allfred bioleck with a hatchet is not that impressive and doesn't have a monopoly on fear! but the Illners are on meth and crack withdrawal for 2 weeks in a closet and kept alive with their own urine if you put an ax in their hand under the broadcast section who did this to me, I even trust them to give a hand cut in Sunnah conformity for financial thieves :-)
We have to give Jauch all his “sleep coins”. If we permanently torture them out of all his talk show guests then we'll get sleep and black money coins and securities and they'll be happy with a final mass of stinky fingers if we just stop cutting their finger joints! while illner waves a chopping ax!
Mass lawsuit against GEZ fees
Troll of the millennium :D
Protip: there is an original video of the speech.

But maybe the video wasn't manipulated by ZDF but by Manuel Neuer
This is all a huge conspiracy!! He gave the middle finger and I'm willing to bet that ISIS is behind it.
Love it!

L

FuckUvaris

I wonder if this guy Böhmermann regrets falsely claiming that he doctored the video, something even the best Hollywood producers cannot do. Now 50% of the Europeans believe Varoufakis&#39;s finger video was faked. People will always be stupid and taken for a ride if they have no clue about how things work.

Gratz. Well done.
Probably the PR coup in TV history!
NEO MAGAZIN ROYALE You Germans are indeed honest.I have seen a lot of you taking a stance against what is happening to Greece.Thank you.

Once again german media didn&#39;t suprise us with their reaction... 

V. had such a big mouth, and so far - NOTHING! He won't be able to eliminate centuries of corruption and nepotism within months.
<b>What the FUCK! What a great mischievous performance!!</b> I hope this wakes us all up!! Because we should understand that we shouldn't believe everything we hear or see in the media. We should form our own opinion, research thoroughly and only then judge OR NOT AT ALL ;) <b>YOU MADE MY DAYJAN :D</b>
This is so awesome I masturbated excessively
Jan Böhmermann you hot snake!
Satire back and forth.... Jan, you've made yourself a lot unbelievable... I don't want to see you anymore in the future... you've made a really lousy contribution to understanding Greece... I think that whole f i e s!
ya

I am a little confused. Was the video really faked by Neo Magazine Royal or is the whole video pure satire and the stinky finger video is real?
sick

This is so incredibly good :D
The best satire I've ever seen!!11!1! :D
What is the name of the gentleman who plays Yanis Varoufakis?
I like The Böhmermann :D
What I don't understand is how they leaked the video to Günter Jauch or the Ard?... Because he probably didn't get it directly from this magazine. Ok, some super smart people with the apparently absolute insight here think that this video would be the fake one or just a parody but that would mean that the ARD had faked the video with the middle finger... ok the German media are brazen but that the ARD made a video like that I can't imagine it being a blatant fake!
This is truly the best fake I have ever seen in our democracy! BRAVO!!! BRAVO!!! BRAVO!!!And hey... Mr. Jauch... embarrassing, right?
How many posts fell into this work? The Böhmermann has fooled you all: The stink finger is real, even if inconsequential.
Like a fake picture..?I don't think you say something like that?Who was that?
You already know that the middle finger video is real, and Böhmermann is a damn genius because he's fooling everyone right now
I was actually so convinced of this middle finger that I thought Varoufakis was an idiot for denying it. I don't think it's ever been put in like this before. great job!
oops, you finally got one of Anne Mötz properly and with real taste. buuutz. gladly paid.
too hot. What Varoufakis brought was funny enough in itself, and I'm eternally grateful to him for that. From now on I will always &quot;show someone the Varoufakis finger&quot; say when I have the &quot;digitus impodicus&quot; mine and hope that the saying will catch on at some point. please help me with this!
David Maleska
that&#39;s a fake video germany!

Fuck germany
<a href="">7:50</a> hahahaha!!! sauber!
But that doesn't change the fact that HE SAID it!!!
I would also pay GEZ for that
It reminded me of Odessa on May 2. When they showed an incendiary mixture flying not into a building, but vice versa. I also thought at first that people had set themselves on fire.
Boehmermann is a loser and wannabe late night show host.
So again, in 2013 a friend of mine happened to be at this event because why????? And in 2013 there was no Neo Magazine Royal, how could they have commissioned something like that back then????
omg i forgot siemens:P
guys pls i dont know german
I hope the pale skinny boy continues to be annoying for a long time! Böhmermann is just CRAZY good.
fuck your german
That stupid candidate on “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” the other day? He was an actor you bought to annoy Jauch. Admit it!!! :DD
...And this ladies and gentlemen is why I&#39;m not watching TV/reading newspapers.

<a href="">Varou.fuck.is</a>! καλο!
This is so amazing! :0

very funny, i was crying )))

Brilliant ! This time it was the good guys who screwed over the stupid ones. Unfortunately, this also shows how quickly mass media can use the same things for other purposes (justification for wars / damage to reputation / etc. etc. etc.).
ent stick de finger of the German.....if we also leave the European Union it will be even better
just fine
ahhahahahah funny... Greetings from Russia.
))) I think my neighbors heard me laughing! Jauch's face <a href="">7:09</a> - legendary!
lol respekt

Shit with rice, that guy is awesome
It was stupid, dear media. There is far too much dubious and manipulative reporting.
The media has become a vehicle for inciting hatred...
This video was shown today in the media education department at the University of Vienna! (:
Long live the Greeks!!!
Who tells me that this video isn't fake? #fakestinkefinger
But one question still remains unanswered! Where is the video that the Jauch editorial team used in their show? The original stink finger, so to speak... Did Jan Böhmernmann's team foist this on him or was it on YouTube somewhere?
you did great job there guys!at least did they play it to other shows or no one messes up with bild..?and please tell me how they allow these kind of faces on tv...?i mean....its hurtful..you need to ask your human rights guys...

It's fantastic how Böhmermann puts all media in a position of need for explanation. Great satire even the star reaction commented. I'm just saying...mimimi... XD
If you want Varoufakis out of the Greek government give me a thumbs up...

With so many views, you no longer need a GEZ.
Fees financed, exactly. You pay fees for this kind of crap lol. They don't see a cent from me!
Really great video, only watched it because of RocketBeansTV. Invite a few of them who are really great, creative and funny people. Thanks for your attention and keep it up ;-)
RocketBeansTV!! 

Anyone who believed (or worse believes) that Böhmermann created the finger should please question their sources of information. Satiere is not journalism or educational television - it is entertainment!!!!! If we want to believe something, do we believe it??? A pity !
Suddenly 40,000 more subscriptions
I knew that Marxist would be trouble...he even brings greater shame upon himself by implying it was fake...

Is the jauch actually satire? ha ha ha... the Böhmermann is one too. just crazy
<a href="">0:14</a>That laugh. haha xDTypical Jan B.
This sentence is ironic.﻿
fak varifakis, but what is this business with stinkyfinger?

Böhmermann and his crew are the first real revolutionaries on TV in eons. I just find it brilliant how they take the German mass media, which is (rightly) flooded with accusations of forgery, even further into absurdity with such gags. With their little video game, in combination with this 'disclaimer', they show more than clearly how easy it is to be duped
As a Greek it disappoints me to see how certain European media talks about Greek people. The situation in Europe is quite problematic right now so instead of making the things worse and speading propaganda against a nation, they should try to calm the spirits. I&#39;ve seen videos of Dutch and German shows that made fun of our culture, the same culture that Europe itself benefited from. I wish one day Europeans will have better relationships with each other.

<i>[]</i>

It's not about the middle finger, but about the way you deal with your fellow finance ministers!
Varoufakis paid tribute to Mr Schäuble saying that he has played a great role in the EU and that he is the last of the Mohicans. So Mr. Schauble understood that she was trying to flatter him (that is, she was licking him). So he proudly announced to an audience of Germans that he understood the cunning of Varoufakis and that these things do not pass. The audience laughed smugly because they too understood the cunning of Varoufakis. How stupid are these Greeks, they think they will fool us, the proud Germans. Unfortunately, the whole scene reminded me of the mental level of elementary school at best. Varoufakis showed us in an indirect and intelligent way, without saying anything, the empty shirt of the German politicians and their listeners. If this great people is laughing smugly at Schauble's childishness, then we have a big problem. There is a risk of history repeating itself
<a href="">#stemeseder</a> : Oh look! Does this also work with high-rise buildings, satellites of the earth...or peaceful extra-terrestrial passers-by? <a href="">#InnPIRAT</a> ?!
Bogdina Bogdina

Absolutely magnificent! Wonderful to look at and brilliantly made. :D
Maybe I'm not <a href="">#Varoufake</a>, but Manuel Neuer, and <a href="">#GüntherJauch</a> is not a constructive, discursive political talk but simply populist , quota-hungry, fee-financed wank...<b>Thumbs up</b> janboehmGood suggestion for rethinking the post-crime scene design of the *****.
Well they almost caused an international incident, but I have to say this:R E S P E C T!!! You guys are AWESOME!!! You exposed your German compatriots (Jauch and &quot;Bild&quot;) for what they really are: Filthy racists, good-for-nothing vultures!The whole team which manufactured this fake video must be awarded with the PLATINUM TROLL AWARD! Well done NEO MAGAZINE ROYALE! I love you all...

I'm now too curious to know which editing program this is! So, seriously - does anyone know?
This racism in the comments here from all kinds of countries is just incredibly sad to read in the 21st century.
I find something like that dangerous, I would have thought it was original. Now I no longer know what I see from ard is true or not true.
The moderator totally reminds me of freshtorge :D
Dear people, this middle finger <del>whether it exists or not</del> has no meaning whatsoever. The tabloid wants to distract you from the essentials, it entertains you. It is completely irrelevant what a third-rate entertainment program is saying.
what's on the red frame at approx. <a href="">5:57</a>?
I would like to write something constructively political or something like that, but all I can think of is: brilliant :-DKeep it up!!
how happy he is at <a href="">2:48</a> that people are buying it from him :D. brilliant shit!
We then have to speak out and confess that we faked Jan Böhmermann and the show NEO MAGAZIN ROYALE:<a href=""> we're sorry. <a href="">#varoufake</a> <a href="">#varoufakefake</a> <a href="">#varoufakehochdrei</a>
Brilliant.. It's rare to laugh so much! I want more ;D
Günther Jauch can probably make good use of the damper. Otherwise it will become megalomaniacal in the sense of Germany against the rest of the European world. Only America is the best friend...
Applause applause. This can not be done any better.
Cool
I&#39;m so disappointed and almost depressed since I&#39;ve learnt that this varoufinger was actually varoufake. I wanted those authentic jerks varoufucked already. lol

Jan Boehmermann is now ready to replace Stefan Raab
I know that this clip will not be for everyone because it is 10 minutes long and is subtitled from German to English... But... I hope that one day I will have enough budget to stir up controversies like this. Not for the sake of controversy, but for the sake of highlighting the hypocrisy of an entire nation by leaving them alone to see how they followed the mob instinct because of a clip taken out of context and because of a media that does not do its homework properly. Enjoy! :)
WOW,this is the RESULT of a developed and strong country called Germany??A s a boss of EU,Germany should have given examples of patriotism,union,solidary and respect,not this shit.Also,you will never FUCK the dignity of Greeks.....(we still support your products with our money,dont forget it).Finally,many countries around the world tried it over the years with no result. ;) Greetings and respect to Germany from Greece.

Very cool :D
Thank you ZDF_Neo for the gag of the week! What Yanis Varoufakis actually meant, see here:<a href=""> is
As a greek i will say this:all goverments from 1981 and after were disgraceful and did things worse than better,but this one is absolutely shit.They live in another world unfortunately.They may not want to,but hey will make greeks suffer and thats treason for me.Fake promises and things that cannot be acomplished in the situation we find our selves now.The propaganda against Germany is all over the greek media(not all of them actually) and german propaganda against Greece is all over the german media (again not all of them),what do we think we are going to acomplish with that?Situation is critical and i dont see it getting better soon.Mistakes have been made from both sides and austerity cannot go on for long,but we cannot blame others for our own mistakes.I think we belong to Europe and under no circumstances should we leave.P.S.(1) to all german citizens:greeks are not lazy piecies of shit that dont do anything.There are 10 million people in Greece not every single one of them is corrupted.The private sector works to feed the public sector which is corrupted and thats where politicians should focus,but they wont do it beacause they take votes from there.My father works on the private sector easily 10+ hours a day.I admire Germany.Technology,quality products on every aspect i have nothing against them,but please people dont fall into the propagannda trap,dont be racists against greeks.P.S.(2):i laughed with the video.

Completely independent of GEZ, Jauch, Greek & co. I think the video is valuable because it shows what is possible and how willing people are to simply believe any video. Just yesterday my roommate came to me with a really bad cell phone video of a woman hammering nails into wood WITH THE FLAT OF HAND and she didn't want to believe me that the whole video was fake... o.O. And I always have to grin because &quot ;Varoufakis&quot; so good with &quot;Very-fake-is&quot; fits together ;)
The best thing television has ever seen!
The German constantly needs distraction so that he is not confronted with real connections. Millions are starving in Greece, thousands upon thousands are killing themselves out of shame. And what does the good German say. "The lazy Greeks have themselves to blame." "They take "The money was taken away from us." "The euro was forced on us." a href=""> don't have to show reforms and cuts at Greece level. The money is being used to try to damage Russia. Of course, the loans are hardly reported. I pray to God that Marie Le Pen wins the elections in France and DOMINATES GERMAN is leaving the EU. This association has become the benchmark for mendacity and inhumanity. Dear Nigel Farage, dear Brits, finally put an end to this dirty EU. In the case of Greece, the German media is chattering about help and rules. Firstly, pawnbrokers are not helpers. And secondly , why aren't the same rules required of Ukraine? When it comes to LYING, German media is second to none.
So cool! Keep it up!
Great work, Jan! But how do I get the Greek subtitles? I´d be wonderful to show it to my Greek family...

to the delight of the Greeks and to the great regret of the Germans, the smartest politician, Yanis Varoufakis, appeared in the Greek government and Germany cannot digest this!!!
nice

:D

hahaha yeah :-)) klasse Video so now put the finger for MrJauch and Blöd-Zeitung. ;-) 

Once again you can see what happens when you find something on the Internet, don't question it further or don't find out more about it, form a one-sided opinion and it's widely reported in the media. :DEditing the video like this was really a great idea =) Addendum: And as you can see, I did too at the beginning until I found out a little more about it ^^
Delicious...Don't believe everything you see on the internet or TV :-)cheers......
Yo

 A Greek living in Germany. First of all allow me to begin with this. Dear Neo Magazin and all your team who took part in your eye opening video that proves how gullible and naïve the people of two countries from one man showing his middle finger is reflected  into a whole populations point of view.  Sparking quite ridiculous yet, funny reactions on both sides. Brilliant work! I have read some of the comments below fueled by hatred, and may I say racism much in the same way the media on both sides is throwing fragmented bones of bullshit, as the media is good at doing,  at its people.  When in fact it would be a wiser choice to address the problems at hand.  Since this in turn can only delay the inevitable.

First, act cool, yes, I'll help the country blah blah blah and then trigger something like that
I personally feel confirmed (once again) that my decision to show my middle finger to the entire media over 15 years ago was the right one. 100% TV &amp; Radio -free, since 2000 and &quot;Proud&quot; on it.FU ALL... above all the GEZ &amp; GEMA.
( ͝° ͜ʖ͡°)┌∩┐
asto diaolo kolo germani i glossa sas einai poli askimi san akousma min milate malakes kolo xitler .apotiximeni
the only reason to pay GEZ ;)
9GAG TV is now officially one of them :))
BRAVO to you and from me, a Greek, for making the video to establish that some German Journalists were DIRECTLY HARASSED by the &quot;fake&quot; finger! But the truth is that there is NO need for such experiments, because extreme Greeks HATED Varoufakis for this reason and many Germans still think that we Greek citizens are to blame for the Loans and Decline of our country. NO!!! Our inhumane politicians from the 2 Major Parties are to blame, because they promised Continuous Lies and then Destroyed our country! But since January 25, we THROWN them and now we hope that Tsipras will do GOOD! I hope you do NOT let your Politicians Ruin you! DROP THEM and put RIGHT people in your Parliament!!!!
NEO MAGAZIN ROYALE for one hour of broadcast time at <a href="">8:15 p.m.</a> please! Thanks!
Shit GEZ GEMA gone!
 Yanis Varoufakis,  Of Greeks and Germans: Re-imagining our shared future.<a href="">«Any sensible person can see how a certain video has become part of something beyond a gesture. It has sparked off a kerfuffle reflecting the manner in which the 2008 banking crisis began to undermine Europe’s badly designed monetary union, turning proud nations against each other.When, in early 2010, the Greek state lost its capacity to service its debts to French, German and Greek banks, I campaigned against the Greek government’s quest for an enormous new loan from Europe’s taxpayers. Why?I opposed the 2010 and 2012 ‘bailout’ loans from German and other European taxpayers because:  the new loans represented not a bailout for Greece but a cynical transfer of losses from the books of the private banks to the weak shoulders of the weakest of Greek citizens. (How many of Europe’s taxpayers, who footed these loans, know that more than 90% of the €240 billion borrowed by Greece went to financial institutions, not to the Greek state or its citizens?)   it was obvious that, at a time Greece could not repay its existing loans, the austerity conditions for giving Greece the new loans would crush Greek nominal incomes, making our debt even less sustainable    the ‘bailout’ burden would, sooner or later, weigh down German and other European taxpayers once the weaker Greeks buckled under their mountainous debts (as moneyed Greeks had already shifted their deposits to Frankfurt, London etc.)    misleading peoples and Parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of ‘solidarity to Greece’ would turn Germans against Greeks, Greeks against Germans and, eventually, Europe against itself.» ...

what is said in about 8 minutes, true words... anyone who is interested in world politics will know that such programs are also shown in other countries... an example of Italy with Berlusconi...
They're saying don't believe us if it's your own fault...
You've got what it takes.... first incite and then point out, it could come to light and that's how you manage to appear/remain credible.....and also manage to manipulate your ZDF employees to continue your actions to join in...
all ready
It is called Montage a well known TV tactic they cut and edit whatever they want and attach it to anything they want even if the meaning of one subject and timeline has nothing to do with the other one

Everyone has one <i>like</i>. Everybody is giving likes to themselves in here, or what?:D

Very funny, but the big shame is that Jauch sent it seriously. Immediately afterwards he interrupts Varoufakis, almost inflammatory and provocative. That's not journalism, that's arson.
When will Jan B. admit that he received a million from Jauche for claiming that his video is fake?
Jan you old rascal!!! :D Absolutely great!
why is there a red frame between <a href="">5:47</a> and <a href="">5:48</a>?
It's so ridiculous to me what kind of "trivialities" people talk about. you can relax here. Such nonsense! Reinhold from the Upper Palatinate.
What Varoufakis has come up with is an outrage... that Germany doesn't give the Greeks any room to breathe and that Greek families have to starve, fueling existential fears and driving up suicide rates was still ok, but when the finger is raised, whether true or not, the fun ends. ....
nose shadow
2 Million views in two days... WTF?

Is it really true or does the baroufaki say baroufes?
I have no idea, but I find the alleged original more unrealistic than the reworked one :D
lol super!!!

It doesn't matter at all whether he gave the finger or not, Greece's entire behavior towards us, even without this explicit gesture, corresponds exactly to this.Greek politicians without any backbone! Who don't even appease these anti-German movements among their own people, but actually build on them. Greece could have declared national bankruptcy long ago without Europe and without Germany. Even without this video, without images of hate speech, etc., we Germans have been getting hit in the face by the Greeks for years. IT'S ENOUGH!
best video of 2015!!! the joke deserves a prize :) keep it up...
Greatest show ever - even if the fake is just a fake - that's how the media works...
Günther Jauch looks like a bulldog
Hahahaha and even millions of people fall for it - the middle finger is real. :D
<a href="">1:30</a> nice Photoshop!Joooooke.
GG dear Jan B. There's some smoke in the whole story again
<a href="">#ZDF</a> <a href="">#NEO</a> you have nothing better to report: Renate Sommer MEP <a href="">#CDU</a> is for genetically modified plants see Renate Sommer's homepage! <a href="">#TTIP</a>
Thank you very much Mr Böhmermann!
great.
Kudos to the people who scripted the show. It's really fun to watch the video again for the 3rd or 4th time because you always find funny references. In any case, very well done :D
There is no better way to prove that in the digital age, image and film &quot;evidence&quot; have completely lost their evidentiary value. How do you know whether a video or photo was posted or not? The fact that photos and videos are being faked or manipulated has been going on for decades. It was practiced quite excessively in the Soviet Union. Every time a functionary fell into disgrace, he was retouched from group photos with Joseph Stalin and the like. What was still rudimentary and clumsy back then and therefore easy to expose has reached its temporary and frightening climax with this current number. Digital post-processing using computers opens the door to the manipulation of moving and still images, whether with or without sound. What at first glance appears to be a successful demonstration by Jauch and colleagues turns out to be a disservice to the Internet in the long term Data Source. Because both the mainstream media and the alternative media can now constantly accuse each other of working with fake video and image material. Ultimately, it will boil down to the fact that digital data as a whole no longer has any evidentiary value because it can be manipulated. If the ZDF_NEO magazine manages to have an entire arm inserted into a video as authentic, who can claim that unpleasant people won't soon be arrested because of "video evidence?" who were manipulated by the services? This is a very, very bad development and I view it with great concern!
d

What program is this done with? Minute <a href="">5:19</a> I want to learn this!
Who actually cares about such gestures, even if they are not true? <a href="">#WhoCares</a>But it's a strong piece...
So hot!!!
Τhat was so fucking clever!

How did they circulate the video?
Countries do not exist.People exist.The problem is NOT between the people of American vs UK vs France vs Greece ...etc.The problem is the bankers &amp; politicians vs people.Politico-bankers of the world get richer by enslaving all people with debt................. AND THEY ALWAYS GET THEIR FEE.

nobody understands the video :D
Too nice :D
Well, who's the bad guy here? Mr. Jauch or Mr. Varoufakis????They make a scene out of it.....
Dear Günther needs to be handed a shovel and then he can learn to work in the Gulag. Such a loser.
If you constantly pour oil on the fire and then in such a stupid and white way, the Germans don't have to be surprised that they are once again one of the most unpopular peoples. And among us in public. Millions of other Europeans would have liked to show this finger to Germany. Dear German people, pride comes before a fall, remember that.
Jo

I don't want to know how many people really think that's real and then respond even worse to the Greeks :D
The nice thing about this video is that more and more people are coming to the conclusion that journalistic work with press information using alleged video evidence does not have the value of tuning in
Something to think about. Right? Another lesson similar to &quot;the wave&quot;

Seriously, well, I'm just saying who puts in so much work with a fake... Yes, ok, if you don't have anything else to do...
Now what should be done .. I suggest that the finger should be pointed at those who Republished
Nice

terrific
I appreciate the German humor and i find it really interesting,but in times like these...you must act maturely

Jan - fantastic anti-racist video. It&#39;s too long for the hardcore grumpy Bild readers to understand. I think you should do a follow-up to show the dense people more simply.

No matter what the original is now. I think he's absolutely cool!
It only occurred to me when I watched it on TV again, but then also in this YouTube video: What are the red interimages at <a href="">4:11</a>, <a href="">8:06 </a>, <a href="">9:01</a>. A mistake in cutting or intentional?
neo is such a child's shit
stick the finger to germanyor maybe betterflip germany the birdMan Guys, Varoufakis didn't say show the finger...<a href="">why should he do the finger gesture?
That's why Adobe After Effects costs a lot of money. Where did the Böhmermann actually get the money for the license?
Thank you NEO Magazine. What Günther Jauch did there borders on incitement to hatred. This is obviously a campaign to create sentiment among the German people against Greece. It's a shame that there aren't more people with brains on television like you, dear Jan. If you now find out how such programs come about, what strings are pulled here and who will give you the Nobel Peace Prize from me. But if someone wants to sell you the German television award, don't accept it! Greetings from the Internet.
Hahaha you Germans!!!!!
It's interesting how many versions of the scene you can find here. Once with the hand down, once with two fingers, once with the index finger, once with the middle finger. And quite apart from the fact that the whole thing was not only completely taken out of context, but even presented in a contradictory manner, and further apart from the fact that the accusation constructed by Jauch would be completely irrelevant even if there was something to it, I still see that Version with middle finger looks the most fake.
The jauch reminds me of a teddy bear
i read the title as &quot;finger a fake&quot; =/

The laughing machine ruins everything. A pity
Don't you understand people... it's not even about the middle finger! Isn't anyone listening? He said something about... we could have simply announced insolvency back then and thus given Germany the finger... but we didn't do that .........Man it was the SUBJUNCTIVE !!! IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FINGER .. LISTEN TO THE CONTENT THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DISCUSS ABOUT! This Germany was so gagged by work, everyone would go to war immediately, only if the propaganda stations write it to you. I just feel sorry for the Greeks and this entire Europe. You can hardly expect anything from Germany anymore. Be born, work, die. Merkel and Schäuble have everything firmly under control. People have so much anger at this life of working and dying that they would all like to kill themselves.. look at the highways and streets, how the people are all destroyed.. then it's over once to another country.. somewhere by the sea.. then look there... DO THE PEOPLE HERE THINK THEY HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THAT? WHY BECAUSE THERE IS NO SEA HERE OR WHAT? WAKE UP! Work is certainly important... but all of this goes a thousand times TOO FAR! Just take a look at this here on YT, that would be a start: KenFM in conversation with: Prof. Dr. Rainer Rothfuß (University of Tübingen)
Divine!GEZ level over 9000!!!!!
Laugh...! very good
The child inside you is proud of the man he has become today?
People of Zagreb unite! :D
Finally the editor of this unspeakable video speaks plainly: <a href="">
I think your details are really cool. You even paid attention to red lightning. :D
.

Merke fuck you !
:D The red cuts xD
plz translate all your next show, it is so funny :) kisses from Paris ;)

Genial
Hopefully the masses will realize that the narcissistic Jahn B. Once again they're just talking rubbish, they're doing satire and bad stuff at that!
Watching smear papers, stupid TV and cardboard politicians collapse in the face of their reusable predictability... It tastes so deliciously bold to me, like ice cream in winter and is as revolutionary as a fat Havana in the subway. A cheeky bit of fun like a trap for fruit flies. (We thank the intellect of the fruit fly!)Where the spiritual sun of Europe is low, even a whirlwind casts long shadows!MORE!, we want more!
<a href="">

German media ate shit again..hahaha..!<b>I'd be happy to pay taxes for something like that</b>
Arglos
How brilliant, please keep it up and you'll be happy to pay fees for that
It couldn't be better!
What does the red frame mean?
Im ashamed of my goverment and of course my minister as a Greek, but regardless of our politicians we should stop the hate and start respecting each other.Eurozone was supposed to unite people.Don&#39;t let varoufucker make us enemies.

My condolences to everyone who takes this seriously

Fuck you gay germany
Great! Thank you, Jan Böhmermann! About time someone said that.
Now Jan Böhmermann's editor, who edited the video, has also taken a stand on foreign TV..... see for yourself..<a href=""> Off!)

2m views, hilarious xD
How would it actually be if Varoufakis himself ended this unspeakable and counterproductive discussion by simply saying "Yes, I gave the finger and I just talked nonsense to Jauch...So what?" Even the last idiot should have understood by now the context in which this happened. And that would make the last reason for even dealing with the topic obsolete. But no matter how many things I heard from Varoufakis after the broadcast on the middle finger debate... there was somehow never an admission that he had actually shown the finger... But all the more wise words, how meaningless they are discussion is. Does he lack the grit for it or why can't he do it?
LITTLE SHIT, what would happen without Germany
At first I thought we had to stone the Böhmermann and deny that we came from Bremen! But: With this background, I have to say: Bild and Jauch should dress warmly! I could easily pull the nastiest videos and images from the internet that completely compromise all of Germany's politicians. But it goes without saying that large media editorial teams do a little better research here and don't just use any "documentary videos." without checking the source. Especially not if there is a clear connection to a Satiere magazine. If I were Bömermann, I wouldn't boast about the act and make it great, but I can't find anything reprehensible about the act. But Bild and Jauch made German television viewers look pretty stupid!
Just like the Böhmermann is grinning, it's just awesome
But you really have to say that Böhmermann's editorial team did a great job. If you know that the “fake was faked” Then you notice that he makes the same hand gesture twice. But without knowing that, it's really indistinguishable from an original. Hats off! :)
Germans and humor, a bad combination
Stick the finger to Sloider John

If it was so easy to achieve with the finger, then please try the same with the German Bundestag. For two days you put extras in green suits and the chatterboxes unanimously raise their arm against a free trade agreement with the USA or something like that. I promise that I will not research whether this is a fake or not. Sometimes one should ignore the &quot;reality&quot; shown by the public broadcasters. Then don't question it... :D
Damn, were they or weren't they? :D
At first I thought that Böhmermann was really behind it, as he had already done something similar with TV Total. But in the end it doesn't matter whether this video is right or not. It draws attention to one thing: the unnecessaryness of this discussion. Has politics really become so boring that a finger from two years ago is causing such a stir? Society and the media seem to be more concerned with people than with real content...
If neomagazin allegedly faked the video in February, why does the actor in the green suit say at <a href="">6:06</a> obviously during filming - in February!? that Günther Jauch ran it... it only ran on March 15th. at Jauch...
<a href="">9gag.com/gag/ao0yNOn</a>

i would have been a great gesture actually. Shame is was fake.

<a href="">

and I bet that no one has learned anything from it and the sensationalism continues unabashedly.
Did enyone else see the red screen at <a href="">5:48</a>?

No joke :D the guy on the right at <a href="">3:03</a> looks as bad as Freshtorge :d
Germany has the bronze medal as an arms exporter and people here are upset about making themselves look bad because of the video. Take your stick out of your ass and be proud of what Germany has shown: Eyyy Leude, we have a sense of humor and can laugh sometimes! Even if Böhmerchen has an Addib beard.
Other countries are finally seeing that we Germans also have something like a sense of humor. So don't get upset about it now! Keep it up people!
Find that pathetic. Soon you no longer know what is fake or what is not fake. Until now this was only known from private broadcasters, but now the fake has finally reached ZDF, thanks to Böhmermann. We can only hope that ZDF doesn't also get money for this garbage from YouTube. What's next? Böhmermann will fake Anne Frank’s diaries? Poor Germany.
so is this a troll or not?

I've already pre-ordered :) <a href="">www.amazon.de/Samsung-Smartphone-Touch-Display-Raum-Android-gold/dp/B00TX5PL52/?tag=amazn09-21</a>
Thanks, awesome! Now Jauch just has to leave the eurozone. I hope he does his homework!
Damned; You all didn't look or listen carefully! THAT'S what he really said and did ;)<a href="">
Hahaha :D
We actually live in states of herd instinct. What interests me is the manipulability of the masses. I thought to myself that if we read Hitler's and Goebbels' texts today and think about how people allowed this to happen to them back then, then we can also ask the question: Let's leave it alone today actually do it with us? What mechanisms are in effect today that manipulate us? In fact, today we form our opinions very quickly, on the Internet people judge fates in a fraction of a second, surveys are conducted more often than opinions can be formed - and many people believe all of this. It's frightening, for example, when I post clearly ironic messages on my Facebook page, there are still a lot of people who don't recognize it. On the other hand, the reduction and manipulation of opinions leads to tendencies very quickly emerging, which then lead to tsunami- spill over society. Anyone who knows how to use this can benefit from it.
Soooo cool
Satire itself is really great and funny...but this is just stupid!
Lollipop

This satire shows the following: the German government and many media outlets have no arguments against the new Greek government. That's why they talk about stinky fingers and other unimportant things. it is racist and wrong that the German government/media  condemns the Greeks and runs one campaign after another against the Greeks. When the Greek government was still corrupt, the German government supported it. The Greeks are suffering extremely from the bad policies of Schäuble, Merkel, etc. It is time for Europe to become more democratic and more solidarity-based! No more billions for huge banks but rather money for people!
Bald 2Kl Views xD

If you don't know yet: IT'S A FAKE; THAT IT'S A FAKE !!!In other words, Jan Böhmermann and his editorial team only acted as if they had faked it. That's why there was a debate at Zdf with the result that now later all contributions that are not true will be labeled: CAUTION SATIRE!!! must be marked. That means: YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE VIDEO IS REAL OR FAKE!!!
Incredible...
AND STICK THE FINGER NOT TO GERMANY, BUT TO GERMAN POLITICIANS.

FLASH! BOOM! BANG!

How do the lying press and Nazi media aligned with them want to get out of this? If it comes out in a few months that Ukraine shot down the Boeing, billions in compensation payments will probably be due.
Am I actually the only one who doesn't get it?
Where does our aid to Greece actually go... - possibly also to German banks and insurance companies (which hold Greek government bonds) in order to "our"? To protect their assets???Manipulation as a means to an end... - Congratulations to Jan Böhmermann for his "finger pointing" - the video is great!
For me, this action is quite ambivalent! On the one hand, Jan Böhmermannn also shows people who are hardly familiar with computer technology and the possibilities of the Internet what is possible. What happens, for example, if at some point some Russian or American president claims that he has missiles in him Direction of the &quot;enemy&quot; shot down? Until it turns out that this is a fake, the “counter attack” can be done. have already been started! On the other hand, Mr. Böhmermann allows himself this “fun”. in a politically tense situation. This isn't about any Greek, but rather the Greek finance minister, otherwise this video wouldn't have made such waves. And then he adds a provocation and says "That's how we Germans are..." (Devastate Europe twice, but get upset about a finger) Here someone is comparing apples and oranges again, because these two things have nothing to do with each other! You can - as has been proven - demand a certain amount of behavior from a politician , tact and diplomatic skill. That was what Mr. Varuvakis was denied through this video. With that, Mr. Böhmermann has crossed a line for me! (And then he "apologizes" to Mr. Varuvakis, says that something like that will never happen again and immediately afterwards the scene with the stink finger runs again... I'm at a loss for words!) Mr. Böhmermann claims that this fake was uncovered If only someone had called him. A question about that, Mr. Böhmermann: Is there - apart from the assumption that something like this could only have been filmed in a professional studio - any reference to you and your team? If not, how can anyone identify you from an anonymous YouTube video? - You have to decide between yourself that you are publicly embarrassing your colleagues because you are criticizing their research work in this way. Is it possible that you just want to provoke? But I probably understand this kind of &quot;humor&quot; not, because at over fifty I'm no longer part of the target group for this show. Although: Is the &quot;old ZDF&quot; not exactly intended for my target group? Then it could be that the &quot;Neo Magazine Royal&quot; is just a test balloon on this "old station". - Hopefully the test balloon will burst soon.
You made the world laugh on how the medias are treating -very - serious questions. A foreign minister is treated like a circus animal, in a tv inquisition when a whole country and people are agonizing. That&#39;s how we start wars. Please, let&#39;s solve LuxLeak (Junker, anyone ? It&#39;s far more important than an hypothetic finger, no ?), SwissLeak and other criminal fraud that put whole countries in despair.Please. Let&#39;s laugh about us. Let&#39;s work seriously on people&#39;s life. You can&#39;t eat money. And you won&#39;t need your money when it will be a total war in Europe because of selfishness and media/politics imprudence (to stay correct ... one say foolishness).Regards and peace to all. We are all humans.

This is true activism! Show how fake the mainstream media really is by getting your faked footage picked up by the mainstream media!Brilliant!

Varoufakis hired those &quot;video hackers&quot; to make people believe that the video was fake!  :P

To all those who bring the argument that the &quot;Varoufakis&#39; Poor&quot; The actors couldn't have known anything about the Jauch program: Nowhere is it said that they recorded it directly while filming V for Varoufakis. Of course (in theory, if it's true despite the media denial) they only shot it after the Jauch scandal; before that, no one cared about the finger.
Now just give peace and work together for a strong euro. We are all Europeans
What&#39;s up with all the fake news lately ? 

I think it's great like Mr. Böhmermann does that. Was great at Raab and now too, keep it up! What I can't entirely approve of is the German bashing that keeps coming back. &quot;That mom and dad can get upset again....&quot; &quot;Out with the foreigner...&quot;You can't blame the average person for having a low level of education. The population depends on how they are informed. When propaganda is carried out in the leading media, it is very difficult for mom and dad to get an overview, let alone understand the background. I wish we didn't always criticize our own population like that. Thank you
greece is a lousy, irresponsible, rude money borrower. decent country people would have asked their own finance minister WTF you did in Croatia? so embarassing. so so embarassing. do something to make us look better. i really wonder what greek people think of their own finance minister.

WHAT ARE THESE RED FRAMES IN BETWEEN I CAN'T GET THEM STOPPED (e.g. <a href="">04:10</a>/<a href="">04:11</a>/<a href=""> 04:12</a> iwo da) CAN ANYONE TELL ME?
It's not necessarily worth the 9 billion a year, but it's a start.
Haha damn great action just brilliant.
The best thing that has happened on German television in forever. Yes, now I want to continue paying GEZ.
Hahaha super good!
I think it's good that he shows the limits of investigative journalism. However, I don't think it's good that he's adding fuel to an already politically heated situation. I don't think that this topic will remain without consequences and I would like to thank this "media awareness campaign". I sincerely apologize to the Greeks.Whether the video is ultimately a fake or not will no longer matter because one side or the other will interpret what happened to their advantage.Satire is important, satire clarifies. But doing satire at the expense of other people who may have to suffer the consequences and <b>couldn't</b> make a decision, had no choice, is not desirable. And above all, provocations directed at entire nations can trigger something worse than just a malicious headline in the newspaper. France had to discover this, the USA will certainly also notice this painfully in the future, and perhaps Germany too soon. Of course, you shouldn't cower and let everything go for fear of consequences. But we should also think about the people who have no choice to decide whether they want martyrdom or not.
ZDF, ARD,,,, dumbing down machines to the power of 1000.
Thanks! This is the second post I've seen from you and I like it. Maybe the money for the fee isn't completely thrown away.
I was really confused
<a href="">#lying press</a> :D
Great thing, I can't do it anymore XD XD XD
Fuck Germany!

sry, either I'm a complete idiot or was this all ironic or was Günther Jauch's video really not real?
Hut ab!

Unfassbar!!!!Gut!!!!

<3 Jan Böhmermann!
i cant believe what is happening to the worls and people like sheaps believe that bullshits. Im Cypriot (Greek) and im proud of my country and my culture. Germans one think i would say to you. You are not the best in the world. your country has good thinks and bad thinks. You Are Not Perfect. Wakr up idiot people this war is not with us but against us. I cant believe that you are members of the war wich companies and politics declare. WAKE UP. WAKE UP. WAKE UP. PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFICULT SITUATION AND NEED HELP&gt; GERMANS YOU ARE NOT PERFECT&gt;

Now I can't see through it anymore... is the finger real or not? So the Böhmermann is real... you can see that...
<a href="">6:35</a> :)

Fake or not, the ECB issue is pushed into the shadows
Böhmermann offers what television and the Internet have been missing for years. Brilliant.
that a Günter Jauch can still look himself in the mirror after a show like that.......and no, I'm not talking about the trashy paper
You no longer need tit thumbnails and cap titles to generate clicks. All you need is Varoufakis. xD
Böhmermann shows Germany and the media the mirror! = 1A! Only the court jester is allowed to tell the truth, after all. After using the word “lying press” was chosen as the bad word of the year, according to the motto: eliminate all the words that criticize us and try to continue to pursue manipulative politics. The aim is to divert attention from the fact that the money that supposedly flows to Greece actually doesn't actually reach the Greeks. but from the German banks that lent money to Greece. And then a diversionary maneuver is carried out alla Jauch, taken somewhat out of context (Varoufakis was not yet finance minister in 2013!) in order to obscure the content. = Our local, manipulative media landscape is sad !
Genial!
Jan Böhmermann, I&#39;d like to meet you some day! You (and everybody in your team) are BRILLIANT! And, most of all, you are EUROPEANS, not just GERMAN!... Thanks from non-corrupted &amp; scrupulous Greek!

Amazing!......
Too cool!
This is so awesome.
&quot;We've devastated the entire continent twice, but when you give us the finger, we freak out. That's how we are, we Germans." Thank you Jan Böhmermann, you have summarized my view of society in two sentences. That has Georg Schramm quality!
As a Stasi victim (GDR and today, see gang stalking, decomposition, etc.), I suspect that, among other things, fake videos of me with children are in circulation. It is wonderful to see how videos can be manipulated, especially underground due to organized crime (Eastern block mafia) with, among other things, bullying worldwide (experience is available).
Es war circus halligalli
That's just how we Germans are, "Europe has been devastated twice in a century, but when someone shows us the stinker, we freak out."...so that mom and dad can get excited again in the evening after the crime scene. The foreigner! Get out of Europe with him! He is poor and takes money away from us Germans. We are the bosses here... but Günter Jauch brings in as much cash in a year as the tax office in Athens. That really hits a nerve.
Somehow I feel a little sorry for Jauch. He was probably a bit confused and hesitant when he announced the year and received a video from the editorial team and was now the laughing stock of the nation and Varoufakis demanded an apology from Jauch. Especially in a crisis like this, it could have backfired. On the other hand, it is also shocking how easy it is to spread a lie and speculate. This also shows us that you really shouldn't believe everything on television without confidential sources. But nice fake and <a href="">06:34</a> awesome xD
Did Jauch or anyone else answer this in any way? :D
Ohhh, how inventive. Circus Halligalli pulled this shit a few months ago, but almost no one noticed.<a href="">﻿
Hammer

Thank you, thank you and thank you again! That was an absolute stroke of genius! Excellent!
FAKE! It wasn't Varoufakis at all, it was Lord Voldemort.
There are obviously still some gaps in education when it comes to the First World War :P﻿
Unfortunately, Varoufakis expresses himself incorrectly when he says the gesture is a fake because everyone fixates on the statement in the video on the middle finger. And the gesture is not a fake, but rather the compilation in the Jauch broadcast. Which unfortunately in no way reflects the actual context of his statement in 2013. He should make that clear in clear words. How did it actually work that he was perplexed when the clip was shown on the Jauch program? The conversation was actually quite good up until then, with the basic message that we are Europe and we have to stick together until the clip came, who had absolutely nothing to do with the current topic and Bang was the whole conversation for the ass. But I think he was still able to collect sympathy points, at least that's how it seems to me among my friends. And thanks to the NEO MAGAZIN ROYAL, which you With your contribution you will show the so-called investigative journalists and the people who believe everything about what the &quot; serious&quot; Political talk shows, newspapers and etc., what's really going on now is the topic of Greece is about the humanitarian catastrophe of the people who live there.PS. The editor who came up with the idea probably deserves a case of beer!
Everything fake! Yanis Varoufakis didn't give a speech in Zagreb, it was just me in a good disguise! &lt;----- !!!!!
the guys says everything in the last minute! (if the greek translation is correct) he says &quot;we Germans destroyed Europe twice in the last 100 years, and yet if one guy shows us the middle finger we go crazy!&quot; Thank you for that dude!

Great, more of that, maybe the bourgeois will stop making every scandal big, thanks neo Magazine ;D <a href="">
There is a hidden clue at <a href="">5:49</a> - to further confuse you? - one or two frames of just red. The same thing happened in the original Varoufakis video... at point <a href="">1:49</a>. Mean... :D
Well, she could do it the other way around ^^ To end this hunt, which is inappropriate in both cases
Ti ka8ysterimena ka8armata isaste re malakes eseis?
<b>Standing ovation</b>No shit, I stood up and applauded.
Oh man, I can't remember anymore :DD
Have you faked it away or replaced it? It turned out pretty good
Alder...get your secondary school diploma first before you...??? Go to the bank, take out a loan, and then don't pay it back in the agreed time! Stinky fingers?? It's a minor matter! Fucking would be the right word!!! Man..what time do you live in???? Contract is the magic word!!! Anyone who doesn't comply with this has lost!!! Especially “us Germans” !!!! I'm getting fed up with having to pay for something when I haven't even been born yet? We should think about that!!! We don't have any balls left in our pants!!!
This is the hottest fake ever. Pretty bad.
I'm surprised that such dangerous nonsense is still popular here. Criminal liability must be examined here. This is presumably an attempted (digital) fraud with consequences that can result in massive claims for damages. The fun is over here. A &quot;Someone&quot; In this case, the name Böhmermann can no longer hide behind the pretext of satire and a television station.
Cheers, Mr. Böhmermann! I laughed heartily. More of this “media manipulation” please!
Has anyone else noticed these intermittent red frames in the video?
Next week everyone will have forgotten it again and will be running after the next populist lie. What I've already encountered here on YT about foreign-controlled Germans is really sad. Luckily there are exceptions, few, but they do exist.
If it were true, it would be funny. So just embarrassing.
I celebrate Jan for this action and for stepping on the pants of some YouTubers :D
You know the man tells a story about paella pans, right? XD
Brilliant!... Always only trust the media as far as you can throw it and form your own opinion.
Great action! Thanks for that !
Top! :D keep it up!
Yes, the Böhmermann! In my opinion it has always been underestimated! Just great!!!
brilliantly done. The only winner in all of this is Jan Böhmermann
Fakeception

I want to give this brilliant video 10000000000000x more likes than I can :)
Varoufakis probably doesn't exist at all. At some point he will take off his mask and Hape Kerkeling will reveal himself!
You have outdone yourself
Yes-hello, Mr Varoufakis  will go home and report what happened to him. As always, the lie will have no chance of asserting itself against the truth. We, as so-called "do-gooders", will carelessly squander our chance to correct the error in EU policy. With such actions we do not help a young family who has to hand over their child to the SOS Children's Village, or a Greek pensioner who jumps from the balcony in fear of what is coming, without Preese reporting it. Be clear, we are supposed to bail out Greek banks that are not willing to pay taxes, the Greek people had to drive their children out of Greece. As a father of a family, I can roughly understand what it is like for a Helenian family that MUST encourage THEIR offspring to leave their HOME. To be honest, I am ashamed of the campaign against a people on God's earth.
A wonderful confusion whether real or not?! and the comments here who think it's a fake... SATIRE I love you He gave Germany the finger?! If he had shown it, it would probably fit better xD How long has he been in office? naa? how old is the video?! what exactly did he say? not just the one sentence with the &quot;would have&quot; Finger?!
I've seen four versions of this now.1. With middle finger2. With index finger3. With index and middle fingers4. A gesture without a specific finger. I'll probably never find out which one is real, but since Varoufakis himself says he didn't show a middle finger, I'll have enough trust and buy it from him.
NEO NAZIN ROYALE, it is not so far to remember, "during the assassination attempt in Sarajevo in 1914, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife Sophie Chotek, Duchess of Hohenberg, were killed during their visit to Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a Member of the Serbian Nationalist Movement Mlada Bosna, murdered. The assassination attempt in the Bosnian capital triggered the July Crisis, which ultimately led to the First World War.&quot; - Well, you can congratulate, a Croatian woman helps, Jan Böhmermann makes a finger-pussy joke and what happens afterwards can be understood correctly: "Je suis Charlie!" - Well, I hope that it will prepare Germany for a new war and to lose a third time, and after that the Americans, the Russians, the English, the French will come again for another 20 years without children, without freedom, without culture, etc., There is nothing more intelligent than that... totally auto-destructive.
A prime example of manipulated media <b>Applause</b>And now we're all thinking about the Crimean crisis again
Mr. Böhmermann's primary aim will probably be to show how easily each of us can be manipulated. You don't even need complicated technology. It is enough to simply cut the same images or scenes in a certain order, and the message or the massage can be the same or completely different, depending on how you cut it together. Every media designer learns this in their first year of training. I believe that many journalists today are no longer aware of the consequences that poorly researched facts can have. They are no longer aware of their responsibilities. I hope this stroke of genius has opened someone's eyes again. Even if it was perhaps just a fake of a fake... who knows... Unfortunately, people are very simple. What you see is what you believe at first.
One and a half million views in 24 hours. The Böhmermann knows how it's done.
This means he will go down in television history. But it will be difficult to achieve something like that
Hadn't Circus Halligalli already made a similar contribution with Böhmermann's ex-Neo colleagues? Where Joko & Klaas respond to the fake allegations against “Duel around the World” by showing a fake making-off video (just totally obvious and apolitical)? There were still the same discussions because some people still didn't want to believe it.
In one word: Brilliant. Also the idea with the subtitles. Unfortunately only in English and Greek. So that the hearing-impaired and deaf don't have to be left out, I created German subtitles for you because I liked the clip so much. If you could then add them, then the clip would be completely barrier-free ;-)<a href="">
YES WE CAN

Can someone please post me the source of the original? (At least it was shown in this video that the problem is, there is only the fake one from SkriptaTV on February 12, 2015 and it would be a shame to have a video of Mr. Varoufakis on YouTube that "incriminates" him)
what's with these red frames on (e.g.) <a href="">8:06</a>? Red=comunism! Are these numbers secret codes of the new Marxist-Bolevist movement?
Since when has satire been fake? Not funny at all, sorry...
You have honorable. ..
HAHAHHAHAHHA LIKE FROM GREECE!

The number with Jan the Killer Böhmermann's gasping breathing is also cool because the poor Germans don't want a stinking finger. It's good that Jan the Horst Böhmermann lets these Germans support him through forced taxes, not to say parasites. And it doesn't matter whether he falsified or not whether Jauch spread the lie or not. Afterwards, people cry again when they talk about the LÜGENPRESSE. I think all doors in the economy will soon be open to Böhmermann again. Oh, it's all just satire... and is being a journalist actually a training job at the IHK? Stick the finger to Böhmermann!
What an awesome number! Federal Cross of Merit!
Billy(BEAM) is the last prophet!!! Read Chalice of Truth!!!
The message is brilliant :D
However, it is still possible that the finger was already a fake before the Neo magazine humorously labeled it a "fake-fake". put down. ;-)
Jan has stopped me thinking about our Yanis Whatthefuckis for days because this video is simply the best!
woohoooo
The video file is called &quot;whatthefuckis_v3&quot; ...nice touch!
I love you Jan Böhmermann.
Watch KENFM!!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
What is real now? Should you believe the finger video or what Neo Royale claims?
AMAZING. Not all Germans are humorless. There is hope.
He's really good, this Böhmermann! I like it :)
Large!
Actually, I didn't really like their show until now, but this move gave them a lot of brownie points.. Great!
ZDF makes it clear: Böhmermann's show is satire<a href="">
Bravo Jan! Even if it wasn't real, it would be true. This is real theater, nothing is real but everything is true! A coup! Good job! Congratulations from Italy!
&quot;whatthefuckis_v3.nx&quot;Are all of your project files called that? ;D
<a href="">#varoufake</a> This comment is fake. All words have been reinstalled. I'm ashamed that I'm believed to do something like that.
For everyone who complains about a lack of research at Raab or Jauch and blindly trusts the first source they come across, a successful slap in the face :D
Hahhahaa xDD how the picture interferes. <a href="">#StickTheFinger</a>
best :DDD the picture is also on it ;DD
damn just........WOW............this skinny boy is really the best!!!!!!!!
Brilliantly done! Really funny story, but also a little frightening...
Brilliantly done
Unfortunately I can not understand German, therefore I do not comprehend your comments below.But I would like to ask all of you German friends, for once in your life, please think out of the box. This unbelievably funny prank was actually wellcomed by Greeks with laughter and it was very amusing indeed. Our ancient culture and civilazitation would not allow us to make such gestures. And yes, we invented Europe!!! So it&#39;s impossible to kick us out of our home. Congratulations to Neo magazine Royale for the inspired video and humorous confrontation.

Best action
just awesome!
Hero :) hahaha never laughed so hard
Rotes Bild bei <a href="">8:06</a> was da los?

Jan Böhmermann is definitely my hero of the day. Maybe the whole week, but it's better to wait and see what happens next...
Oh GOD I heard that Jan claimed to have faked it, but I thought the fake was a fake, but the fake was real! Brilliant and respect!!! :D
<a href="">#NeoMagazin</a>   <a href="">#plus</a> <a href="">#plus</a>     (#nachsatz....why do we fail grades #9/11 a...wonderful)
<a href="">

The best example is that Germans are just Russian pigs. Without us Greeks, you would be nothing, Nazi propaganda
soft jauch
Genial!
NEO MAGAZINE ROYALE What is it? Did you give a bad thing about the <a href="">#MacBook</a>  when you spoke, the Apple <a href="">#Logo</a> had to be stuck on the back. That's how good it was You're not taking part in the campaign again, you're probably afraid that <a href="">#Apple</a> will sue you because you dragged your <a href="">#Software</a> into the mud.
Was the editing messed up or why are there always red screens in the cuts?
It's the best video I've seen on YouTube in a long time but it's really well done hahah
what if this video is fake ;)

I can't understand German, but its great
This is possible for subscribers without videos. A social experiment begins, my first channel has already reached 10K, will the second one do it too?! Help me on our way.
There are still some who totally take it for granted. You have ALL clearly seen what is possible with technology. And ZDF Neo showed it to us. That's their hidden message (&quot;Don't believe everything you see on TV and don't always let the media influence your opinion.&quot;)......You can RUCKZUCK out of no one - one or two fingers - or from one - don't do any fingers - just as you like. You can also distort the sound. After watching this video, you should ALL know how easily our views and opinions can be influenced. Because when &quot;THE ONE UP THERE&quot; If we want us to hate someone, then “THEY up there” can do it. rotate it that way too.
Whatever was. Thanks :-) Jauch and Lanz have to get out of state-mandated television. Embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing. Better buy two CBS or HBO series and there's a chance that I might buy a TV again...
Jan shaved xD
Absolutely brilliantly done, yes, that's how we Germans are, we can shit in front of other people's doors, but woe betide you if someone throws a bunch at us then there's a lot of crying. Very nice Mr. Böhmerman and the whole ZDF Magazin Royale team
Super cool thing. You're really lucky that the whole story got so big. That's how I first became aware of you and subscribed.
I don&#39;t trust any more what ever comes from THAT source

Anyone who knows anything about Photoshop and Flash knows that this is a fake from NeoMagazine. His shirt folds all the time, but at the time when he should show his middle finger, the part of his shirt suddenly becomes very static. His left hand also behaves statically in relation to his before and after movements...
So what Böhmermann claims is wrong - he just pretended to have put the middle finger in! Böhmermann actually didn't want to clear up the confusion until this evening. However, ZDF decided to go public with it earlier. It is unclear whether Varoufakis knew about the ZDF clarification when he again denied the finger gesture.
~<a href="">4:11</a> why is there a red picture very briefly
This is so cool :-D
Jauch: &quot;According to our information, that happened...&quot; You can see how much you can rely on when someone says &quot;According to my/our information...&quot;
Can I sign his statement somewhere?
Very funny. It has nothing to do with the actual problem, but who cares. Classic off-topic method to avoid difficult topics - simply make everything ridiculous.
You are Masters Awesomes! Greetings from Greece!

GEILLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!

Thank you ZDFneo for doing something useful with my radio contribution! Now I'd rather pay it :) But I want to add one more thing to the whole debate: Even if the original was the one with the stink finger - what role does it play? Isn't a university professor (which he was exclusively in 2013) allowed to say that this possibility would have existed and express this with a metaphor supported by body language (as is common in the South)?
Guys, it's a brilliant fake-fake.... That means the fake is a fake... He really gave the middle finger.
made my year

Does anyone have any idea what the red cutting errors are all about? Is there anything to see there? I've already run it at 0.25 - but I don't see anything there either
What are these red screens in between?
@Paul Heine nope, because I'm looking at it, it's difficult to stop it in the right place
And you probably still believe in Santa Claus, right ^^? Sweet. <a href="">
Awesome show of shit - congratulations, you lucky ones! :))
I understand what you wanted to achieve with the whole campaign. Firstly, of course, to exploit the media hype to generate attention. On the other hand, to confuse people and make them think or question things. When I read through the comments, the latter wasn't really achieved. Most people blindly believe anything again as soon as it is presented in a somewhat convincing manner. But seriously. Do you really think that the editorial team at ARD/ZDF are so stupid and don't check their sources carefully enough (especially when it comes to political topics)? In addition, politicians lie all the time, which makes Varoufakis' statement in the Jauch interview unbelievable anyway. Nice attempt, but unfortunately failed (in my opinion). My television will probably remain switched off because I don't feel like watching dumbed-down TV. Why do I pay GEZ fees again?
<a href="">7:50</a> "That's just how we Germans are, having devastated Europe twice in a century. But when we get the finger, we freak out," XD
The video is brilliant, but it can also really scare you. I mean... if you make fakes so good, what else is fake? What was in the news that didn't actually happen? We can be screwed over by the powerful from start to finish without us noticing...  That should really make you think
The action of the century: Dwell done, Böhmermann!
Personally, I was really happy about this video. Finally, everyone, no matter where they come from, can see that what we see on television or in the media is actually always fake. Whether this is just media attention or open reporting (as young people who thought while studying journalism, oh yes, I'll turn the system upside down). :)   Please humanity, start questioning things. I'm sure we can finally free ourselves.
I still don't like Varoufakis.
This one is for you Gunther ......<a href="">

&quot;That was Croatian!&quot;<b>almost choked on his popcorn from laughing</b>
I don't understand why everyone is worrying about this. If you analyze the video in <a href="">4:05</a> very carefully (keep stopping), you can see the finger for a very brief moment (in the version where it shouldn't actually be). Beginner.
Read the video description, it's a fake fake. It says &quot; but is it really as it seems &quot;proof <a href="">
People from ZDF enlightened: The video is satire - i.e. faked that it is faked. :)
I celebrate you so much for that Hahahahah XD
One can only congratulate! You really caught Günter Jauch and Bild clean.IN YOUR FACE! You people agitators! It is only to be feared that Bild will not stop now with its embarrassing Greece-bashing.
Here is the real thing: <a href=""> :-P

Great Really !CongratulationsI'm paying for it and I really liked it.Everyone is screwed.
Well done! That worked!
Great.
<a href="">03:51</a> somehow she's hot with her cheeky attitude :)
“Dear editorial team from Günther Jauch,” he says. &quot;Yanis Varoufakis is wrong. You didn't fake the video. You simply took the video out of context and dragged a Greek politician around the studio by the finger. So that Muddi and Vaddi can meet each other in the evening after the crime scene. can get excited again. ...You did that. And the rest is from us&quot; -&gt; That sums it up. How easy it is to create a mood... and how easy it is for Muddi and Vaddi to be drawn into it in the evenings in front of the TV... poor world...
Genius!
The Greek media are reporting serious things today &quot; Varoufakis innocent, Germans faked the video!&quot; , incredible !!!!!!!!!!!
You're all crazy... political games against Greece... and you're joining in
The man is brilliant.
Wtf, the video is making such waves :ooo
&lt;3

honestly.... 2 minutes and I pressed stop. I really can't watch this scripted shit show. That's worse than RTL and Pro7 combined. precisely because we pay their salaries. underexposed pseudo show masters who laugh at their own jokes that aren't funny. with well-rehearsed laughter from the audience or what would be worse, a big sign in front of this place where “laughing” is written on it. worse than joko and klaas and all that fucked up garbage that has the target group 15-25. I'm really sorry, but something like that is just boring, almost as bad as reality TV at 12 o'clock on RTL. German television can really be trashed.
When he said it was fake, I almost fell out of my chair. I thought, you can't fake that perfectly. I thought he was an absolute liar. Now I guess I have to apologize for that. Your video is absolutely brazen, actually outrageous. But the following reactions worldwide are totally awesome. Do me a favor and apologize to Varufakis. Now he's really a poor pig, because the people who watch Jauch don't know you or YouTube and still believe in the video.
Best Burn of 2015. And already in March!
Brilliant performance :)
There is still hope for public television.
Cool thing
Böhmi is simply the best. Treat everyone so hard that they embarrassed themselves😂
The English longbowman's greeting doesn't count in Greece, never stick out your thumb and never never show your open palm in the other person's face, not even for fun, never
How everyone thinks that Jan Böhmermann really faked this... Guys, this is real. But otherwise you were quite funny... not... Don't feel too violent now... You're just a small, unfunny show... Please understand that! Sorry Jan for destroying your world view... I'm not sorry
I bow my middle finger to you, brilliant video :D
Thank you, guys! You are superb!!!! LOL

He looks like Mr. Bergmann, only 10 years older and with a slightly rounder face
The press in the pillory!Too cool <a href="">7:44</a> - <a href="">8:35</a> and now all middle fingers up!
Bei <a href="">6:18</a> --&gt; Dateiname &quot;whatthefuckis_v3&quot;.
The Böhmermann just has it. I haven't seen such a cool sketch in a long time. Congratulations on a successful campaign. Keep it up!
Um, but the Germans didn't start the First World War
This is how you can start a war! o.O
Spoiler: Jan B. Wins
Wow, you can manipulate images on the internet??? Real? Cool! And has Böhmermann now revealed that? Is not true? I thought all the Hollywood movies were real and Batman really existed. Is it all just manipulated? And the Easter Bunny? Is that also invented? That means my mom always lied to me when she hit me with the picture newspaper because I didn't want to believe in it??? Thanks Jan, without you I would never have figured it out. I'm going to buy the picture right away because it has the truth in it. Without you Jan, I would have thought Varoufakis wasn't lying, now I know he is a liar. I didn't give a damn about the stinky finger anyway.
Bravo. WEITERMACHEN! :D

crazy, that shows everything! Our media is rubbish and pure incitement!
OMG !!! It&#39;s great to see Germans giving tr finger to Germans !!!!!Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!

This show needs to be canceled and this fat guy Jan Böhmermann should be thrown out! What kind of assholes we pay broadcasting fees for is really the last thing! Shame on you ZDF! Shame on you, Germany! Germany = a nation of idiots - our message to the world. Well done ZDF, congratulations!
is the green one there Varoufakis? :D
<a href="">5:48</a> I think that clarifies all the questions. Still, of course, it's a great job...And if you pay attention, you can also see this red image at normal speed :)
So with this trick - and I'm not talking about the supposed fake, but rather the CLAIM it's a supposed fake - you really pulled off a god-like stroke of genius. (But we know that you were only faked by ***** anyway ;D)P.S. Why is there a frame of red image in <a href="">5:48</a> (and some other moments)? Does this have an underlying psychological purpose or what?
Touché Mr. Böhmermann! Totally hit people's nerves! And radically demonstrated! Once again you can see how great the news research is. They pounce on things like vultures just to be able to report something. We don't need any research! You can always see it in the reports about killer games, banks, manga/anime etc... Especially since the public broadcasters should already know what their colleagues are doing :I'm just celebrating the achievements of the entire Neo Magazine Royal team! Great work, keep it up!
<a href="">4:11</a> short red screen. Mysterious.What could that possibly mean?
Haha Jan, you are the best &lt;3
I love puke ••↑••
Respekt, respekt!

Now that's sarcasm, isn't it? Oh, I don't think so anymore, I'm giving up
&quot;Great folk talk show&quot; ... perfectly played satire about gangs. What would happen if Böhmermann went to the asylum? Maybe the end not only of the rusty public institutions, but also of the private institutions...?
HAMMER GEILE AKTION !!!!

Wonderful. It's nice that Böhmi and co always succeed in such campaigns. :D
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!

Maybe the version with the index finger is correct?
OWNED!

Great Böhmermann, great
Such dir Hobbies Jan
I am sick of how everybody tries to exploit any and every word , gesture or action and of any state or european official.Germans, Greeks, French, Italians, Spanish and Portuguese.All for their private benefit or maybe of some other&#39;s...

That's still called yannis WHAT THE FUCK IS
Jan Böhmermann is and remains a horny pig. Props to you :D
I like it. Everyone should decide for themselves whether they find it funny or not. It's definitely well done.. SATIRE people!!..I'm happy to pay my GEZ fees for that..keep it up. Attack.
Satire at its best! Hats off to you for that! :D
This is genius! :D
You are the best!
Absolute brilliance. There's nothing to add here
Well, which media in Germany can you still believe?
Nice :D :D

He could have avoided the whole polemic. Then it would have remained brilliant.
<a href="">8:20</a> - I am Greek and I have to say I love the humor of these guys. Although from my experience from several trips to Germany (usually around Munich in the last 3 years), Germans are among the most polite Europeans and they have have never treated myself or anyone else I know like that.After watching the video, even in Greece we were &quot;I still like Mr. V, but if he did this, it was wrong and he should apologize.&quot; What a relief he didn&#39;t actually do it. Who knew there would be a talented group to pull off something like this. Great job with the video. :)

So cool - first Stefan Raab and TV Total fooled and now this! Hats off! And to everyone who believes that Böhmermann is talking bullshit, just watch the episode on the Chinese TV Total ;-)
Danke...

hahhaa



This thing is really really good!!!
ICH WILL WISSEN WELCHES DAS ORIGINAL IST :DDD

If all the people who write comments here (or on the entire internet) and express their great opinions would do the same in real life, our shit government would be deposed long ago
If that was really the case, the exposure was really successful
Instead of fixing their finances, Greek ministers have spent their time behaving clownishly. Tsipras has been bashing Germany for failing to honor past war reparations obligations. His defence minister threatened to open Europe&#39;s doors to migrants from the Middle East. Varoufakis looked anything but troubled in a photo shoot with a glossy French magazine. Meanwhile, the work of solving Greece’s problems has barely begun. Technical teams dispatched to Athens to uncover the true state of Greece’s finances and discuss reform details have been met with stonewalling and delay. No one knows precisely how bad Greece’s cash crunch is. Few expect it can fund itself for more than a few weeks and a solution appears as distant as ever.

Statement by Jan Böhmermann<a href="">
So is that the real thing or just a parody to what varoufakis said about the video have been doctored??

wow as a greek i feel compatriot and comrade with this satirical show if there is a way to sustaing the faulty EU it&#39;s through this kind of satire and selfcriticism of all sides 

What minute is this in the show?
The guy has the morphsuit on the wrong way :D
Uiuiuiui... I'm a little embarrassed now about how I celebrated this thing yesterday. Will positive comments be read out in the next comment comment show? Böhmi, you lousy pig. You knew full well that these would be the comments from less-skeptical people like me...
I'm also Croatian :D &lt;3
It doesn't matter whether he shows the middle finger or not. He says it anyway, so that everyone knows how to understand it... Whether the little finger is added or not is completely irrelevant and doesn't change what he says!
The video with the finger is real, the one without the finger is fake.<a href=""> since the video with the finger was taken completely out of context in order to exploit it in a sensational way, Böhmermann's fake is closer to the truth than that Original.Yes, Varoufakis gave the bad finger and mentioned Germany in the context. But he did it two years ago and in a completely different context than Günther Jauch and the BLÖD newspaper want to portray. And that makes the real video excerpt a lie. And that's what Böhmermann criticizes: a 2-year-old video is used to create a mood against Varoufakis and Greece. And that is sparkling at the highest level.
Genial
Yes, yes, the inner Nazi, a prime example of indoctrination, of manipulation through an accusation that you are not allowed to contradict, otherwise you are a Nazi. And you need that if you want to eliminate all resistance and squeeze what you want from a people. An accusation that no one dares to contradict and a fake guilt that never expires. Who is actually kidding whom here?
Thank you, Mr. Böhmermann, for putting your finger on the wound of fee-financed favor journalism. I have documented in detail that the Jauch editorial team is working with false information based on his first broadcast. Afghanistan War by Günther Jauch: Propaganda with false numbers: <a href="">
You've managed to confuse me with a topic that would normally have been as obvious to me as this colorful dress. Respect!
Great action! Big praise at this point to Böhmi and his army of 88 forum trolls! <3
Oh I sure had a good laugh viewing this one. Big (new) fun of your satire. Dont mind my country (GR) to be included - all the more fun.  I&#39;m all for making fun by being politically incorrect, as long as everyone gets a taste of the same medicine. Keep up the good work, English subtitles are always welcome.

You were supposedly on 89.0 RTL HERR Bömermann
Chapeau!

Böhmermann is clearly the cheekiest cheeky badger xD
No matter whether fake or real - rather below the level of this show...
We want to see something else in the picture.
people the joke is that he actually gave the finger
People take a look at the “Original Video” from minute <a href="">40:10</a>. There's a red frame a few times. Like in this video. For me this is proof that the video is fake!! or is that intentional?! :D
bliblablu

By far the best contribution ever produced on German television. Thank you for that.
THANKS
The only question that comes to mind now is how did you get the video to Günther Jauch?
Rarely have I laughed so much in tears. Thanks for this TV MOMENT :D :D :D
terrific!
In the morning it got 8,000 clicks and now over a million WTF
We need more people like Jan Böhmermann... whether it helps is another question, but we definitely need him ^^
VFX Demo reel :) 

so... he tells the germans that he wants to show them the finger and tell them to fuck off and when people then find out that he didnt actually show them the middlefinger suddenly everything is okay?so... you think it is more problematic for someone to give you the finger than to announce to completely leave you alone with the problems?interesting.

Do you know Wayne...or a sack of rice just fell over in China...you must have problems...and you know what, who actually needs Greece??? no way with the people... out of the eu and away from the euro... very simple...!!! midfing midfing midfing
It's just stupid that the guy on the green screen during filming says that Günther Jauch did it. Can he see the future? :D <a href="">6:05</a>
i.e
The whole thing is fake, you fools
Jan Böhmermann will certainly be fired in these minutes.
You are great!!!!

haha böhmi is the best
The funniest thing is that Germans still read Bild.This is not a newspaper...this is a bunch of backbitters that decided to say their &quot;news&quot; for money.

...was thoroughly entertained
So now I have to post something here... I can't bear that the star comment is at the top...
<a href="">#BÖHMCEPTION</a>
I want to transfer my GEZ fees directly to the Neo Magazine editorial team!!! :)
hahahaha, I love you!!
Oh man, you get it! The good Yanis definitely gave the finger! But it was taken completely out of context and, if you look at the original video, isn't even worth mentioning. Our trustworthy &quot;media institutions&quot; are just trying to manipulate us and win us over with their populist means. This is a thoroughly successful mockery and exaggeration of the whole thing (satire). And even if Varoufakis lied, so what? He's a politician, that's their main job! He didn't really harm anyone. Our politicians are making fun of us even more. So next time the picture is opened with the heading “Liar”, please ask yourself what that means.
LOL LOL LOL

For me, Jan Böhmermann is a modern Georg Büchner.
Well, lie first and if you get caught, act like it was a joke
So dear “internet experts” then explain what the &quot;truth&quot; is :D
Wow, the millions were filled up quickly
I don&#39;t know about Varoufakis but Schäuble is definitely sticking the finger to Greece...

have you &quot;officially&quot; apologized to Varoufakis? I think he had a bad couple of minutes...

It doesn't matter whether the video is real or whether the finger was mounted. Jan Böhmermann is not interested in becoming known, but rather in getting people to think. That's exactly what he did. Due to the confusion, many people finally have to think and deal with politics. Well done Böhmermann
Satire

How arrogant you are! In Germany the press never lies! And anyone who says otherwise runs with Pegida is a Nazi and wants to clone Hitler!
LOL there is a red image at <a href="">4:10</a> / <a href="">4:11</a> min is that normal???
I need my totem to know if I'm still in another person's dream.i r8 8/8 breddy gud
