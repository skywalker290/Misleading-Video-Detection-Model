I am a nursing student. I spend 1 year in hostel. Really I miss my parents. Every single day I was crying alone. My classmate are not so good, they trying to bully me and really I miss my home. I want to go home but I can&#39;t. 2 years later I shall go home. Baba ma love you❤. And my old roommate are very bad. They are really bad and they talk rubbish word about me in front of my teachers, classmates. So teacher changed my roommate but one of my roommate is 30 years old and I am 19 , she scolded me everyday about any matter. But I can&#39;t even imagine that how to I complain about my roommate in front of my principal madam. That&#39;s matter really hurt me everyday and I am crying alone every single day. I am emotionally distributed and unsteble. Please suggest me what should I do  ? 😔😔😔😔😔

Yes

Ye kon shi movie h
Actually, the song sung in Indian Idiol by Sayali was more beautiful than this real one

They tried to hide the true history by making the story of the war between Muslims and Sikhs fake. Hindus are the worst Brahminists! Today South Indians are spread everywhere! They want to give their tribal nature to all Hindus! They are a great devil! Nowhere can they be polite and educated people. They made that border movie to cover up the history of Sikh genocide.

Miss you papa 😢😢
movie neme
I love mom dad
I am about to get married ❤but to tell you the truth, I have a desire to live a different life from other people, the main thing is to separate myself from my father, mother and brother, it is very difficult for me, all these are just 22 now or I don't know what I do 😢 family I want to live in a girl's house but it seems that it is written in my destiny or I feel very bad that my mom and dad are taking tension for me, I have become like a queen or my future husband will love me from now on. It's almost like killing me to work, I don't even tell my family that he said that because they are the best choice for me. I don't feel like telling anyone why I have to go away from my father, mother and brother. Why don't you express your feelings in the comments? share card🥺
Love you so much Papa❤
love you dad ❤❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭
I don&#39;t know where is my father cause I&#39;m 5 year old and this time my mother and father get devoice 💔💔 I miss you papaI wanna see you just one time please papa come to me😭😭😭 I don&#39;t see you since 14 year&#39;s 😭🥺

Love you papa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💕🤗🤗🤗🤗😘😘☺️
