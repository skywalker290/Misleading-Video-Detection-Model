Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nah

Ask you once, ask you twice now
There&#39;s lipstick on your collar

You say she&#39;s just a friend now

Then why don&#39;t we call her?

So you wanna go home with someone

To do all the things you used to do to me

I swear, I know you do

Used to take me out, in your fancy car

And make out in the rain

And when I ring you up

Don&#39;t know where you are

&#39;Til I hear her say your name

Used to sing along, when you played guitar

That&#39;s a distant memory

Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha

I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you

I&#39;m not your number one

I saw you, with her

Kissing and having fun

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I&#39;m done, uh
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
After three, after four times

Why did I bother?

Tell me how many more times

Does it take to get smarter?

Don&#39;t need to deny the hurt and the lies

And all of the things you did to me

I swear, I know you did

Now you take her out, in your fancy car

And you make out in the rain

And when she rings you up

She know where you are

But I know differently

Now she sings along, when you play guitar

Making brand new memories

Hope you treat her better than you treated me

I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you

I&#39;m not your number one

I saw you, with her

Kissing and having fun

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I&#39;m done (I&#39;m done)
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done (Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no)
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done (I&#39;m done)
If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
And now you take her out, in your fancy car

And make out in the rain

And when she rings you up

She know where you are

But I know differently

Now she sings along, when you play guitar

Making brand new memories

Hope you treat her better than you treated me

I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you

I&#39;m not your number one

I saw you, with her

Kissing and having fun

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
Yeah, ciao adios, I&#39;m done
(You get on with your life)

Ciao adios, I&#39;m, I&#39;m done
(I&#39;ll get on with my life)

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Sweetness, sensitivity, beauty, talent should not be criticized, but with all these things if you also have faith you are already at a certain level. In other words you women please limit yourself and don't upset your limits.
Was this shot in Morocco?

The video was inspired by the scenery of Major Lazer, Dj Snake and MØ; but with its own essence. It turned out excellent, and the song is absolutely great.
Can someone like my comment 😂

My favorite ❤❤
Why are you fooling people, you don’t want to live like people, throw yourself on the carousel and others, and don’t confuse others, you’re sick of everyone already

Best song in the best country of Morocco

Someone else here in 2023

Can’t believe it’s been 6 years already. 😮 Perfect song for all ex-partners. 😂

I have been listening to this song since my childhood, it is my favorite song, I really like it, it is a very energetic song.
Aug 2023 .??

🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿Long live Algeria and Palestine ♥️🇩🇿🇵🇸✌️
Such an amazing song, but I don&#39;t get why is she showcasing mostly black people in a Moroccan themed video, if you gonna showcase a country&#39;s culture and architecture...why get out of the context when it comes to the people/performers?

Calling u m ph
I love it❤❤❤
Since 2021 I have never healed 😢

The vibe of this song never dies

Morocco
Yes 2023

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nah

Ask you once, ask you twice now
There&#39;s lipstick on your collar

You say she&#39;s just a friend now

Then why don&#39;t we call her?

So you wanna go home with someone

To do all the things you used to do to me

I swear, I know you do

Used to take me out, in your fancy car

And make out in the rain

And when I ring you up

Don&#39;t know where you are

&#39;Til I hear her say your name

Used to sing along, when you played guitar

That&#39;s a distant memory

Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha

I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you

I&#39;m not your number one

I saw you, with her

Kissing and having fun

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time

I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I&#39;m done, uh
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
Ciao adios, I&#39;m done
After three, after four times

Why did I bother?

Tell me how many more times

Does it take to get smarter?

Don&#39;t need to deny the hurt and the lies

And all of the things you did to me

I swear, I know you did

Now you take her out, in your fancy car

And you make out in the rain

And when she rings you up

She know where you are

But I know differently

Now she sings along, when you play guitar

Making brand new memories

Hope you treat her better than you treated me

I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you

I&#39;m not your number one

I saw you, with her

Kissing and having fun

If you&#39;re giving her all of your money and time
