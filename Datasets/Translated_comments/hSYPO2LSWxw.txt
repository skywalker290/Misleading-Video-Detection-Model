Big fan sir video zaldi upload Karo
Mumma 


Brother, where did you come from with such a hot butt?
what a acting 
This is actually a true story but it is not as it is shown. Although these things are shown, there is much more to the real story of Ashish Sir. A man from my village who drives a taxi went with his taxi one night and then suddenly a woman came and sat in his car. Then an uncle asked him who he said he was. Then our lake covered the depth. After driving the car for some time, the driver uncle took the girl to his house. Then the girl said that I have come to take the money. Both time the driver stopped but the girl did not come then the driver uncle went to his house and rang the bell, then the girl's mother came and said who are you, what did you do, then the driver said that a girl has just gone to this place. I drove the car to this place so I wonder how it is. Then her mother said, “My daughter, what are you saying?” The cab driver said, you sister, please give me the money, that madam is so strange. Then his mother came to know that it must be his daughter, but his mother showed the photo of her daughter and asked him who she was. The driver was shocked that why did he find the photo and he told her that it was him. Then her mother said that my daughter has been in an accident for a long time. Hearing this, the driver went there and somehow got deeper from there. Her mother always felt that her daughter was still here and had complete faith in her. The next day our driver was informed that he was very sick and had been in the hospital for several days but it was clear that he was not well. After a few months, he went well but he remembered everything about the girl and whenever he sat in the taxi, he always looked ahead because he remembered her face and her smell. That's what happened ️
This video is now 2 years oldTime really flies

2022

Roko Vali scene me kon kon Dara tha?

How didi I miss your video
Sir you ate really horror movie director

Who was acting like an auto guy? I was very impressed that's why I did it.
The twist was amazing 

Brother, why did you leave your heart and when our girl put her hand on the auto driver?
The cinematography is better then bollywood movies.keep it up sir and lots of love



Now this is what they call serious comedy  loved it bro. Btw one like for Deepak Sampat!From an avid Bengali fan of yours ️

O brother, what have I given?
After dealer
So scared
Drama k chkr ma mere sans suk gyi thi

Brother, what kind of mast are you making? like maan gaye, you are the best director ever. Think of a job for a director in Bollywood. Mast banonge.  And what a great acting friend, it was fun.
Sir. First we will give cough syrup to those who are coughing. I cursed that fat came into my hands.
Taking the most required service in an odd hour and not paying him, can&#39;t be a joke.

opppp

I am very scared at first time but after the last part I cant stop laughing Seriously very funny

Anushka Sharma is looking good
EXCELLENT WORK 
I am feeling so scared 

Funny as always 

Here after jadoo&#39;s vlog

Who is watching this on 1 jan 2022

Lol

 what is this man XD

I got a mini heart attack when the girl first time appeared. (Almost)

Omg the ending was so good... Can&#39;t stop my laughter

Ashish is the best director of our country and also the best comedian 

Hey dad, I saw this amazing thing 
Watching again because bhai, what is he uploading?
pls ASHISH BHAIYA TRY SOME FILMS.THIS WAS SO AMAZING

Finally after <a href="">9:30</a> mins ashish appears in video great work man keep it up

Casting for the lady ghost was terrible.Terrible acting by her.Her wig is really noticable

OP CONCEPT

Bro this was absolutely amazing and I actually got scared for the first part and then when Ashish revealed his identity then I couldn&#39;t stop laughing bro. Truly Amazing!!

Brother, I looked backwards in the car mirror, is the ghost visible in the mirror or not there?
Yes

when I saw asish I got relaxed

<a href="">1:40</a>

<a href="">1:40</a>

<a href="">1:18</a>

1&quot;

nonsense
D------------------

I'm scared shitless
Yes The dealer ke baad

Rongte khare ho gaye the mere  pehle toh............. o god!!

Sir ..great video 
Bisara riksha wala
Just think how Ashish would have screamed at <a href="">6:41</a>Love you Ashu 

U should be a director 



Friend, Didi gave me the truth
At starting a was feeling scared later I laughed 

Yeah... we all appreciate ashish&#39;s direction skills and his work.. but actually can anyone explain me how an auto rickshaw has the sound of pulsar!! ... at <a href="">2:46</a> 

Dude, when the girl disappeared from the rear view mirror, I nearly peed my ‍️

Mst video hi bhai️️️
Fat ke hath main aa gayaPaper......Abe gandi nali ke keedo kya soch rahe the?

The story was good, but it is wrong, by doing this the person in front can also have a heart attack, his life can also be lost.
Great

Oh brother 
I have given a lot
OMG !! damn good bro..
It's a one day sale <a href="">4:19</a>
You&#39;re the girl and the airshow guy his acting was so amazing love you guys and I hope the girl with the white clothes on and I hope you make a lot of movies and God-bless you and you make lot of money

I wish Ashish bhai ke main aapki directed ek movie dekhun wow  keep it up good work

Amazing and awesome
Superb acting

Meri phat gaye

the story was very good but last mein hag diya

I got scared
After that, the most horror jobs are Auto-Rickshaw Driver and Pizza Delivery Boy

Here to see this after &quot;The Dealer &quot; 

Super video bhai
Very horror

Njece

<a href="">9:19</a> apne hero ke entry to abhi hue happy birthday our hero 

Ending tho xD

So op  it was really goosebumps. It was also very funny 
Omg is it going on silent? Is your BGM playing?
My pant got wet
Make this orvi horror video yaarr
Last seen me fhat gya tha mera

Tbh, the rickshaw wala asked for double fees bcoz he was scared with the girl&#39;s attire.Even though he asked for more money, she should have paid him.What if the riskaw driver got a heart attack?I know it&#39;s just a video but what if people got inspired by it and do the same?It was injustice to him but wonderful acting by the team.

Op Bhai 
The ghost is looking like a gareeb anushka sharma isn&#39;t it????? Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz comment below if you agree
Deepak sampat ke liye bhi likes bnti hai he also doing great job for this



<a href="">7:10</a> best reaction of auto legend auto

no one thinks that : when rikshaw wala saws safed sari wali aunty he returns his auto rikshaw back voh bhi direct turn markefir jab he asks her kidhar jana hai and they talk then vo usko ulta rasta lejata hai [lol] [lol] [lol]

Saandu

This is known as the &quot;REAL PLOT TWIST &quot;

Imagine watching this is on night

2 minutes silence for the poor rickshaw wala

I liked this video hey 
Kunal was best actor in this group and specially when he was kmala

the scene when she came and touched him at first i got a shock without current really fun it was

Iska music real me faad deta hai….ekdum horror 
Thug life for that ghost/girl

Lalchi peshe wali bhootni 100 rupee kam kie tabhi boli thik hain

Bohat amazing hai no doubt why Ashish chanchalani is known as best YouTuber bohat hardworking hai and dedication se kaam krte hai aap ️ even your whole ACV team everyone is really working hard ️ Ashish, Jadoo , Simran and Kunal ️ you people are my favorite ️

In reality, this should not be done with the poor man's labor money.
