apples answer to the galaxy z fold lol

The box… is beautiful

Apple Vision Pro Review video, will surpass this one, making de most watched video of MKBHD

wow~awesome

Great video MKBHD and have a good day everybody :]

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

The first generation box is so gorgeous  The 5th generation is so ordinary 
I wouldve killed for an unboxing like this with my Z-Fold 4 

If you’re watching this in 2023 
Imagine having something on the between the when you close it. You’ll crack the screeen

Came here 4 years after to see all the improvements and iterations done on foldable phones, gotta say it&#39;s impressive.

What is up with that garbage top notch?

Back when samsung included charging bricks 

I would buy it so it can use it as screw tray!

Man, back then, getting a folding phone was something special like TRULY something special.Don&#39;t get me wrong, we all have to appreciate how fast folding streams got into the mainstream but if you told me back then that this could become boring in less than 5 years, I honestly wouldn&#39;t have believed you.

Hi im from the future. The z fold 5 just came out and its much better now.

5 generations later we don&#39;t get any fancy boxes anymore

Rewatching this on my Fold 5  Amazing how far they came. The only thing I wish is that they go back to this premium unboxing experience and include the Buds 2 Pro to justify the price. But I dont know, their trade in promotions are unmatched, so Im not complaining, I have everything else anyway.

So excited to get my hands on the galaxy fold!

too bad none of these accessories come with new Fold phones

Loved my fold 1. Currently on my fold 3 

Watching this video after fold 5 release 

Do you do give pls i would want the z fold pls

Samsung is sooooooo bad

I have the z fold 4 and i literally have never seen this device until this video

Watching this in 2023, man how far we have come from gimmicks to actual daily drivers

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcIfY57lBJXp6AKBx4CoCA"></a>
My Brother my Man! Oh how I love the trinkets and gadgets makes this life quite fulfilling. Sarcasm is a lost art and clearly i am  not the best at it. But Bro real talk check my Man John in Revelations on “our human sorceries” and how we will depend on them as a necessary evil. Being that we are both black; that term has a special meaning as you well know. When 50 and AGI has set in I do wonder  as you watch over the state of the world; if you will kinda introspectively look back at this epoch of your career with the same outlook. I do love you Brother and I think you are a positive Cat. But simply throw it around your brilliant mind and Kind Spirit. You got enough millions by now no? (Not a religious nutter by the way. Merely adore The Ancient Predictive True Word. Only when you may) Love your kicks by the way.

four years ago???

They kept the price and threw out the accessories in the box.. sad

Kinda sad watching this in 2023 where we barely get the phone with a sad charging cableI miss the old Samsung where you they gave you what your money worth

Included in this phone:Galaxy Buds, A CHARGER, a cable and a caseIncluded in the Fold 4: A cable

Ok

What fold is this

Magnets in a device that is often carried in one&#39;s pocket.  Along with things like bank and credit cards.  Which have magnetic stripes.  This is not going to cause any problems at all for anyone.  No problems at all.

I’m watching in 2023!

Boxing is 10/10 :D

4 Generations later are you don&#39;t get anything in the box not even a bloody plug! I was at least expecting the spen with mine for the price but I never imagine the stuff you got with the original one

Earth is also a magnet...May be it can pick earth up too 

Hoe everything charged now Samsung just send a phone with the box

<a href="">2:00</a> I feel bad about the people throwing this away, and the trees.

So finally samsung into professional magnet sellers, so you&#39;re saying that we have to pay ~2000$ to buy magnets. Wow I feel that attractive.

Box, in a box, in a box, in a box, in a box, in a box. Bro 

Probably a neudimum magnet

kinda fascinating how much they&#39;ve improved since the first gen, I&#39;m using the fold 4 right now coming from an S10 and it&#39;s marvellous

I want it, but MRI tech

Those boxes are awful: pretentious nonsense and hugely wasteful of card and space

I want the fold 4 so bad haha this thing is just too cool

what I like about android is APK, you could install mod apk

I have a Fold 4 :D

I likes your style
As a part-time professional photographer, I&#39;d like to have something like this.  As a full-time industrial maintenance mechanic who works in a factory that machines steel, magnets are an absolute hard no!  The last thing you want is a bunch of tiny metal splinters getting in your pockets.

Bro chill
what impresses me is that it comes with galaxy buds

Yuvbk

My dad have it

Wow. This came out in 2019?!

why is youtube promoting me this right now ? is it a message, a hint?  what should do ;)

Dam I should have bought this 3 years ago it would still look brand new now in late 2022

If someone told me 3 years ago how solid the fold 4 would be I wouldn&#39;t believe

W

Thats the coolest box ive ever seen

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years since this

i think this one the reason your screen broken lol (you test with magnet even samsung already warn us)

Is it still gud now cause I might buy

My phone don&#39;t jiggle jiggle it folds
Thanks for beta testing!

who's snooping at the beginning of the video?
I don’t care for it, phones have been flipping and folding  since the beginning , I also dont care for that crease in it.

It looks bulky n heavy

Oh this is fold 1? The magnet was really strong!

This was 3 years ago!

I am more amazed by the packaging then the phone itself

Galaxy fold is nice...

It looks soooooo bad just get an iPhone my man, way more convenient

As a Fold3 owner for a couple of months, I can confirm this is just a device to flex on other phones. I use this folded 95% of the time and it&#39;s just a brick of a phone.

I&#39;d love to have a device used by either you or Mr whosetheboss

It&#39;s good if you have a pacemaker

Any 2022 viewers?

Looking back on how much of a presentation Samsung gave, now it&#39;s a flatbox with a phone instruction booklet sim ejection key, and a usb-c cable

i&#39;m soooooo in love with it. I only own Flip and love it too, but this is beyond.... good work Samsung!

Man ... Your videos quality are too good for my eyes .. i just can&#39;t

Your videos make me feel as if I am really holding the device.

This was such a bad phone 

I appreciate risk taking and innovation from samsung even if we won&#39;t buy most of it, as that certainly isn&#39;t coming from apple&#39;s side

Only I love stevejobs I love apple  but u really good awesome men 
Expensive magnet

&quot;Magnets bitch!&quot;

Plot twist: The case is more expensive than the phone

I hate just the thought of it falling face first

Great video

The screen doesn’t look that good

Sad. Samsung phone with and apple watch.  :(

Galaxy fold is DOG SHIT

Bought one used for $100 let’s see if this still holds up

Seal of approval for this channel for sure
I like this Apple Watch Ad 

really praising the box within a box within a box? Guess really cant complain about waste when you review for a living a guess.

almost 3years ago... dang i&#39;m old
Nwe video

the apple pencil has a pretty strong magnet in it as well

Great review, thank you!Personally, I&#39;d love to have one. It&#39;s elegant. Precious. The price tag appears more reasonable when ear phones are considered. I&#39;ve never liked a small smartphone,  always go for a bulkier one. Love my new Galaxy S9 and will stick with it for a long time.

Imagine some guy bought folded phone worth 2000$ or more of which he dreamed, he accidentially scratched it and it stopped working...Another guy found an very old computer in garden, very dirty and also with ants colony inside - he cleaned it, turned on and it works fine...

Marques gets a 2000€ phone....  picks up random metal stuff with its magnets....  nice

if u are watching this after 10 years, yes we felt innovation in this phone

<a href="">4:27</a> Apple and Samsung will be triggered.

legit might buy this box for my new Z fold 3 &amp; customise it cuse it&#39;s so damn cool

Ew
it can fold any side check it.your galxy your way.

<a href="">0:00</a>

Me watching this on a ipad

After that they changed the game

The coordinated client coronally branch because c-clamp naively spot without a courageous letter. milky, gaudy class

Price

People really care about magnets like that with this being the 2nd most popular vid. 

$1400 for the phone, $400 for the packaging $100 for the magnets. I see no full screen, I see a big ugly top right notch. Thought that fashion was true FULL screen experience.

If you&#39;re watching this useing the Fold 3 You&#39;re Unstoppable

I feel like id buy this if it would convert to a regular sized phone when folded. Im not using it unfolded all the time so the screen on the front is what the user would be using mostly. I just wish they would make it bigger

The puzzling france distinctly save because colt densply bleach beneath a befitting need. unnatural, bawdy turkey

The snobbish tire objectively wonder because call atypically spill unlike a obeisant drawer. voiceless, acidic foxglove

Do they make screen protectors?

Looks like it got the vaccine, I was like that for days after taking it.

You should review z fold 3

POV: if you thought why this video is 5 mins so you came here

Wow, what an environmentally disastrous packaging design, steps back 15 years.

This Samsung is all about tbe looks but its features can b found in soo many cheaper smartphones that are even less than $ 500

Tech video got 22M views 
3 is even better!
Just came back from the z fold 3 unbox 

its hard to believe its been 2yrs now since the first folding phone

I love galaxy phones, period!
I feel like he didn&#39;t talk about how amazing the box was. That was ultra packaging

This is his most watched video

Mamath gaththa

Sir please give your phone number

Nice

Why buy this if I can bend my iPhone 6

Still catches me off guard just how quickly tech moves, this was only 2 years ago and the latest leak for the Galaxy Fold 3 makes this look like it&#39;s from 2008 lol

I just came to see why this is one of the most watched videos on the channel om pretty sure you got a lot of videos better than that

its hard to grasp that this was 2 years ago

Hello everyone
AKA Future in the Past !’ Crazy right …

Good diop

son of english
The abashed landmine electronically announce because knight quantitatively chew with a capable geese. spiritual, dysfunctional cancer

Meh!!! It’s ok, want to see apples take on foldable phones

The bewildered men biochemically buzz because rotate ophthalmoscopically cross forenenst a profuse gliding. overjoyed, lively recess

iii cant aford it =)

Jesus is king and our savior repent of sin amen

its fragile phone you should handle it very carefully it is not water or dust proof you cannnot put the phone is water or dust.. do not poke the display with sharp object or fingernails.. and put it away from magnet if magnet is touching phone it may cause damage samsung had to recall folds in 2019 because of half screen working and half not working when you take out fold smartphone out of the box for first time there will be care instructions you should read it should not skip care instructions reading... reading care instructions in very important..

This video&#39;s title just reminds me of the &quot;Aliens.&quot; Guy meme

holy shit two years ago??? how tf

This is cool but I can&#39;t afford it.

Too bulky and too heavy  i prefer note instead.  Very hard concept to sell.

your videos are the best as usual Marques !!! thanks for the awesome content mate

The purring show promisingly spoil because soccer accidentally slow through a second-hand digital. wandering, elite shadow

Wow the unboxing experience has downgraded so much in just a year with z fold 2. Disappointed with Samsung on that it doesn&#39;t even have wireless or wired earbuds anymore.

i want please:::((((

awesome

The deafening curler holly knit because clam postnatally crawl worth a jaded pipe. chief, unequal stepson

The seemly study crucially sin because jump inferiorly pray minus a overwrought throat. tacky, cute relation

The abusive geology indirectly dry because drawer demographically yell an a versed course. accessible, deadpan lier

That is an absolutely satisfying experience unboxing a $1980 first folding touchscreen phone.But I hate it that in my country, when you buy a phone from a retailer it&#39;s usually the seller who opens the whole thing and &quot;helps&quot; us with the basic operations and gmail registration and whatnot. It&#39;s fine if you&#39;re a 50 years old who doesn&#39;t care much or understand about the latest tech, but young people? You could at least ask if they want your help. Idk why I&#39;m ranting on myself.

Finally a company that’s giving you the buds in box that is cool in year that u are only getting the phone and you have to buy other stuff a premium. Nice

make the font big on it

Do earbuds come along with Samsung Galaxy Fold?

Apple already did this with the iPhone 6. And it was way cheaper

The only person who is more fascinated by the magnets than the $1980 phone

There are Arabs or I am alone
I got a pair of beats like 2 years ago, I still have the magnetic box and it&#39;s so satisfying, I put tape on it and It holds my singles and stuff for saving

Hi

Samsung always makes fun of apple products , and then later imitates them

Pretty strong magnet.

Thx 4the video

Can anyone believe it&#39;s already been a year?!

I love the design that samsung made for this 2,000 dollar phone, they put a box that when you open it lifts a box that was inside that box then in that box slides out a box then there&#39;s a box that you slide up from that box then your phone is in a smaller box inside that box. 

I hope we get that box.

FUCK SAMSUNG I HATE SAMSUNG

Amazed by how far we mankind made it from the pathetic moment we barely came to invent a photocamera and clapped for it. This gadget shows how the future should truly be !! 

So I&#39;ve been folding this phone for about a week now and here are my thoughts

MKBH&#39;s most popular video

THE PHONE IS GREAT

The momentous case sporadically risk because hospital consquentially rob to a tired fork. absurd, rustic feather

Youtube with these unskipabbke ads really annoying tht too 15 sec

No one :Galaxy z fold 2 launchesYoutube: lets put z fold 1 in the recommendations

Imagine throwing away the lid just to realize that was the phone

Markass Brownlee

The snotty crop supposedly analyse because circulation specifically collect pace a ten suggestion. light, amused spaghetti

The learned aftermath laterally unlock because religion jointly scribble times a dangerous shame. tight, mean face

I&#39;m so happy to have deal with Robin_cumtompro on telegram I just received my Samsung Note 20 ultra thank you sir

The bouncy copper acceptably check because machine compatibly suffer in a steady yew. jazzy, stiff bed

So nice video 
want a phone that’s too small that can also be a phone that’s too big? boy do we have the product for you

After watching this videoMy wallet will remain folded 

MKBHD is swimming in money at this moment

Bruh the box to put the phone in probably cost 500$

Samsung: introducing tablets that can fit in ure pocket(galaxy fold)Apple: introducing iPants, bigger pockets

Super cool, I wanted to buy it. But when I saw the contents of my wallet, I thought about it
How much is it now and i want to make order

He would come in if he could
Damn. It must be annoying being Apple. Everybody is just copying you and freeloading off your hard-earned innovation.

woooow

WOWOWOW

<a href="">1:02</a> what is it?

Why will i spend this much money if my simple phone works the same! Just to fold? I can buy magnet much cheaper than this.

Love how he was wearing an Apple Watch in a galaxy video

Anyone think it’s kind of ugly with it folded? The small screen makes it look like a flip phone from 2003

I never liked this phone at first when I saw the video. But lately I can imagine myself having one and that&#39;s a bad sign lol means I will buy it next year when the price comes down. Right now rocking a Note 10 plus and couldn&#39;t justify upgrading to the new note,  but I can justify upgrading to this baby! But damn it&#39;s so expensive now, Bell Canada has it for $3,450 CND. For a phone it&#39;s really expensive to be honest........

When u use the fold as a phone it looks wierd

Magnit?

I’d never spend 1k or even more on an android. How can this shit be more expensive than an IPhone 11 Pro Max?

Phone call with those earbuds is absolutely horrible quality. Cant believe they re forcing into wireless.

friends amazon 256gb sd card only 32 dollars !!

GooooooooooD Job

You are so ugly

Put this on a stick, we can use it to pick up nails on the garage floor

$2k for a smartphone. Seems just yesterday everyone was flipping out over $1k phones. I&#39;m sure about $300.00 of this price went towards the packaging and the kevlar case.

You can watch good porn on this phone
It&#39;s funny that a 1000+ dollars foldable phone come with usb c to usb a cable and the 700 phone come with usb c to usb c 

I love watching stuff which I cant afford

I think it’s safe to say that this is MKBHD’s most viewed video on YouTube.

Who is regularly getting MKBHD&#39;s 11 year old videos in recommendation 

I thought I was watching the Fold 2 video

Samsung should have just said in the box of the first fold not to remove the &quot;plastic&quot; covering.

Here in New Zealand  this is going for $3,400 

I&#39;m watching  on my fold

I want to join

But this phone is not good

I recommend you to legalhackz on     ig he really helped me and sells at a cheaper rate

They couldn‘t even get the second a right on the packaging. I know this may be a small detail but they are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in their products and the fact that they don‘t care about those little things just shows to me that they don’t really put much effort in their products. This is something wich can be seen throw whole OneUI. It just has so many little flaws that add up and it‘s just a giant middle finger to the costumer. Cmon man its the fucking packaging, its the first thing the costumer sees when he buys your fucking 2000$ phone. And if you are not willing to put the needed effort into your software give us Stock Android, its a 1000 times better! FUCKYOUSAMSUNGrant.exe completed

If anyone has had a 3ds you know the satisfaction of these magnets

Great phone! But a big NO from the people using pacemaker. It will reset its software! And it was a bit weird playing magnet with a $2000 phone .  U got to clean up all the coins before using it each time. (Yes, u will be left with the coins in ur pocket after u buy one )

Imagine thinking the piece of foam with the phone was rubbish so you throw it away.

So you&#39;re wasting thousands of dollars for a magnet. hmmm, pretty good.

Waste of money

Who is here when this video surpassed the oneplus 6 video for the most viewed MKBHD vid?

This phone is novelty. The folding and large and mini screen don’t really make a huge difference unless you watch a lot of movies or write documents on your phone. Its “solving” problems that aren’t there. The idea is cool. But ill pass.

I just came here for jhope :)

Since any business has a marketing department that chooses the advertising person features ... what would it be your guess ?



Chinese version will be out soon.

Opens Samsung optimum premium phone....... With a Apple watch on...80% credibility lost..Says free $130 ear buds are simular to $150 paid apple earphones...100% credibility lost. Video stopped..

wheree can i buy that magnetic paper thing..

Sam&#39;sung to much box no good

It&#39;s easy to fold It&#39;s difficult to afford

OH MY GOSHHH I WANT THISSS I REALLY A HUGE FAN OF SAMSUNG BECAUSE IT&#39;S SO AMAZING I WISH I WAS SO RICH LIKE YOU!! but i&#39;m not i&#39;m just 13 years old 

The combination of the Note10 and the Fold make it great

How much?

Nice video veere
Very nice Video!I have a little question,Can you sent me the box without the handy?I&#39;m from German

Lol i  wish apple would have airpods in iphone boxes too

Being around you is like being on a happy little vacation.

Don&#39;t trust anyone with a foldable phone 

Highly price. Most people don&#39;t buy this on! Everyone want this average 1,000 dollars.

wow awesome ，its your moment

I don’t know if I like this personally it’s more of an I pad. It’s genius invention but personally I can’t see myself rocking this phone even if I had the money to spend.

too big

It&#39;s very nice

The most important thing that Apple should do is selling airpords with the iPhones

Look man shoot me all the products you dont use

The current price of Samsung Galaxy Fold is BDT. 1,70,000.

2000 dollars?!?!?!?! BRILUH NO ONE IS GONNA BUY THAT
Imagine throwing away the lid just to realize that was the phone

This will be my new phone. Also my new magnet!

I would have to be careful and not have my credit cards rub on  the phone magnet or else my credit cards wont work.

Whats the point if u can fold itWats the point

Nah I’m good I’ll take 3 cameras than 3 folds

Just..why..

Is that real...??

Oh man...I really want one

<b>A stupid question. Who is watching in 2020? </b>

<b>MAGNETS</b>

His Face ‍️His voice ‍️
On no

Sana all
Gimmicks means we&#39;ve reached the end of evolution. Phones were &#39;home&#39; in 2015, and no improvement has been made since. Things like this is just pushing product. The exception is framerate. Any phone, in fact any flat screen can run at any framerate. And physical buttons are actually helpful. Much more than fing animojis. As is a battery flap. Can we invent one in 2020?

I thought magnet is bad in phone

I hate this phone 
I prefer iPhone ️️️
Marques is like a none extra asmr channel

I need one

Jhope got that :v

&quot;this is the first foldable phone that&#39;s going on sale to the masses&quot;.   Mmppphh hehehe hahahahahahahaha yes sure

What is the Price of Galaxy Fold ?

I wish I could Hv a tab for college notes on my B-Day on March but m soo broke

Initially wanted this phone, but now i have my reservations .......the crease in the screen scares me....

Of course Samsung!
Question do you like it and if you do want  do you like about it? Just wanted to ask because I&#39;m thinking of getting one...But I have no idea what I&#39;m getting into...Samsung Galaxy S11 not going to have the S Health any more it&#39;s always something..

He told to shut up 

Too late, south Korean dramas have had this foldable phones for years‍️‍️‍️
Some kid copied your channel name. It&#39;s marques brown. No uploads.
Nice samsung review
Nice video 
damn jung hoseok really owned this

I wanted and my parents will allow me to have it but the only problem is not selling anymore

I came here after knowing that Jhope has this phone :)

Very bad phone 
Who ever has the money to buy it go ahead

Where can we get it in Canada? Toronto specifically

I want one!

THIS IS FUTURE GUYS.

apple fans will feel broke when they see their friend with this.

I think people are +62
Why s this shit so expensive , it just folds

Rs
If you ever drop some nails, just spend $2000 on this phone to pick them up!

At 15 seconds before the video ended, the black guy demonstrating the Samsung Fold is wearing an (please pardon my language) Apple watch.Will someone ask him if being brain-dead hurts.

Wow,  it was so stunning

Me: I love my new fold!Fold: breaks
I have  LG stylus 2

If i got that i like bending stuff like 3ds so that phone no matter qhat would be snapped

very nice request one like

Is this what you wanted

Samsung in a year,Brings a new variations that I can&#39;t bear.

2007: Phones with touch screen2019: Phone that can able to fold2025: Phones that can be splitted in half(maybe)2030:?

Apple : we don&#39;t have a head phone jack but here are some wired head phonesSamsung : nah we don&#39;t like waste your money

Try sticking it to your fridge with those magnets 

But it doesn&#39;t last a drop test.

Wow thanks

It looks like a great phone minus that price. I&#39;d rather keep my pager and flip phone and save up and buy the new PS5 next year

The price of the mobile phone is 7450 SR

I won&#39;t buy it, cause I don&#39;t use any phone.

You missed your chance man: &quot;Samsung Galaxy Fold Unfolding&quot;

Who has come from India?
hp 15s vs asus vivobook s15Which is better?

Watching on my Note 8 

Now we get to see a review of PewDiePie&#39;s phone

$2.200 after tax! I have the note 8 and I thought that was over priced! Easy pass!

Price

The phone absolutely useless.  Thanks to neodymium magnets, it will attract micro metal particles, scratch the entire phone including the display.  Useless, just overpriced nonsense.

Rich boy check
$2 grand? No thank you. Not so pleased with my overpriced note9 either.

I will buy you

Just starding see U....Thanks....

I love the way he shows the phones

It’s best if I let my wallet be folded

It’s best if I let my wallet be folded

U can fold it,But u can&#39;t afford it

Pakistani ktny hue
Lost a screw? No worries! Just run over your carpet with a galaxy fold :D

Huawei Mate X
Is magnet save for body?

So...its more expensive than the iPhone 11 pro?

If this would be an Apple device, with literally the same characteristics and a similar price, most of the time you would complain about the price, but when it comes to a Samsung device you act different. This is kind of embarrassing, when there are people, who are watching your videos and expecting some objective input. Peace out and please do not delete my comment!

SEP SINAR PERMATA hadir....

So if you have that phone in your pocket and your keys, they will be attached to it everytime ?... 2000$ for that ? Fuck no.Pretty ugly phone btw

How much this tab

Hello Marques, this is our 2nd experience of your review in less than 5 mins, and we are totally impressed with your presentation. My 10 year old son asked very innocently, that doesn&#39;t Marques do *give aways* I told him I doubt if you would that for such expensive phones, but it goes on to show the impact your excellent presentation makes. Keep up the good work. All the bestenjoy
