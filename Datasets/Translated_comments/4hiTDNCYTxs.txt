This is a fucking elevator
Another granary?
this is 100% NATO video)))))))
Why do VKS bomb empty warehouses?
where are they shooting?
If the third world war begins (and it will begin), then the atomic bomb will 100% be used in battle!
This is Raqqa: <a href="#lang=he&amp;lat=35.808504&amp;lon=39.124138&amp;z=16&amp;m=b">#lang=he&amp;lat=35.808504&amp;lon=39.124138&amp;z=16&amp ;m=b</a> . And it seems they didn’t hit the oil.
This is RAKKAH, not MAARET-EN-NUUMAN. Distance over 200 km.<a href="#lang=en&amp;lat=35.809974&amp;lon=39.127829&amp;z=17&amp;m=b">#lang=en&amp;lat=35.809974&amp;lon=39.127829&amp;z =17&amp;m=b</a>
Wow handsome guys :)
Israel won&#39;t like their ISIS being destroyed.

Well done VKS RUSSIA, KICK THOSE MUSLIM. GLORY TO RUSSIA.
Western explosions are sharply different; they hit the center and the charges are more powerful and more effective
always passing by then nearby
They hit clearly and didn’t hit the grain elevators! Bravo!
Russia continues to lie about its exploits in Syria. The GSI <a href=""> grain elevator is turning into an oil storage facility, although even a fool can see that the oil is burning with black smoke, not white.
Again the deer hit the granary.<a href="">
<b>this video can be called whatever you want - the lochtorat edrosni will believe in everything...they believe that Putin knows nothing about Plato and about the Rottenbergs</b>
What's going on!? Why didn't they get into the tanks!?
complete crap, quality is crap
And somewhere Erdogan’s fart is burning. Greetings to Russia from normal Ukraine. Good luck )))
- <a href="">#Russia</a> says strike hit “oil facility” in Rif <a href="">#Aleppo</a> - Actually hit water treatmnt plant in <a href="">#Raqqa</a> <a href=""> v @ArtWendeley— Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) December 2, 2015

220km from where Russia &quot;Defense&quot; Ministry claimed RuAF hit Ukayrishah refinery again <a href="#lang=pt&amp;lat=35.810053&amp;lon=39.127808&amp;z=16&amp;m=b">#lang=pt&amp;lat=35.810053&amp;lon=39.127808&amp;z=16&amp;m=b</a>

Why are you talking bullshit here, clowns? They constantly bomb past, so fairy tales are for suckers.
ISIS man's mouth pissed!
AN OLD FRENCH SHOOTING FOR SUCKERS AGAIN?:))
Why do they show videos with the same frame rate? Do they do it on purpose at 5 frames per second?
Why don’t ours send saboteurs and stick radio-controlled mines to a couple of fuel tankers? And then blow them up right at the checkpoint. They would kill two birds with one stone and ISIS would take revenge on the Turks. + the border pass would be violated...So you need to fucking prompt
hurray hurray Turkmenistan turkeys
Turkey
killer Belarus.
child killer killers from Belarus .defol Turkmen mountains dishonest sadly low
just as in the past. You&#39;re all dogs during the Ottoman Empire of Turkey.

beauty
gentlemen feed them
If you could do it like that in Ankara, it would also look beautiful.
fucking missed the mark
Burn, burn clearly, so as not to go out! :)
The video shows water treatment plants. It doesn't smell like oil. Bombing infrastructure - like in Donbass, right?
So maaret-al-nuuman Syria is the west of Syria, there is no ISIS there by definition :))))))))
The obliques are shooting!
super soul rejoices
Boom in vomit!! Well done Russian brothers!
But we cannot intimidate the Turks. No matter how much we shake our nuclear might, we demonstrate in front of their noses the full power of our aviation, including strategic aviation and launches of pseudo-tamahawks from the Caspian Sea. The Turks clearly did their job, so you don’t have to hide right next to us. Apologies? what kind of apologies!? Sucked in!!?? Do you want more? Please, it will be for you. fly in
Chet didn’t see at least one of the two tanks explode. everyone is making fun of me. And they tell us that the accuracy of missiles and aerial bombs is unique. No matter how much PR they do, you can see everything from the frames.
The Ministry of Defense is really tired of the crooked installation.
Probably at the oil depot there is "air conditioning" broken ))
Is this called a deviation of 3-5 meters?
at 14 seconds the UFO flies by. What was it?
please use your precision weapons you are missing it. wipe them out please

why show mistakes? Are there really no more powerful bombs, so that even if they miss, they still hit?
ISIS members are probably already cursing Erdogan for his idiocy. I hope they burn alive.
FOR ALEXANDER BUTKEVICH
Those who write missed the mark, idiots, the goal is to damage the structure and not to cause a man-made disaster
We missed two tanks, why didn’t we hit them? window dressing, because Türkiye will still shoot down if they hit the tanks.
Well done.
wow
They now distill oil in simple dugouts. As they did in Chechnya at one time, they will bury a barrel and instead of pipelines there will be ordinary ditches. We need to go to oil production sites and break down the pumps.
Vrubai Tarkana
wow, got here)
Well done!
