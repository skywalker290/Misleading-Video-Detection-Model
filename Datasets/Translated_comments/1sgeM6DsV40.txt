My first Samsung phone ever and I never looked back. Currently typing this on my new S24 Ultra.

Wow! Samsung s7 camera is sick! Better than Redmi phones rn

This comment won&#39;t get 16.5 Likes!

Why am i watching why is this even recommended

Samsung still does great solid clicky buttons

This was the most beautiful phone at the time i still remember it specially in black 😍

Been down an &quot;old phone&quot; rabbit hold for days now. I&#39;m glad Marques has been doing it this long ^_^

Watching this in 2054! ヽ(´▽`)ノ

Best intro soundtrack in mkbhd channel history
Same photo quality like nowadays smartphones!
Is the wallpaper Garuda Linux?

On the S7 you also have a Custom EQ over the IPhone 11.  The IPhone 11 feels like a bar of wet soap…lol.  I rarely listen to the IPhone 11 speakers, the Sammy S7 was dope with some NC Headphones.

I loved the S7, I have the Iphone 11 and would gladly take the S7 over the Iphone 11.  The Iphone 11 does not have Pro Mode like the S7, does not have Macro like the S7, does not have Metering, Spot Focus and a host of settings the S7 used to have.   Look how young 7 years does to your face, amazing!!

I stayed about a year and a half with mine, it was a good phone, in 2019 a switched him for a S9+ which is with me to this day, the battery is becoming bad each day and the screen has some burn ins but still works as brand new.

This used to be my dream phone back in the day bruh meanwhile I got a iPhone 14 and hey I still want a galaxy s7

When phone only have 1 camera lense at tge back, it simple and clean.

oh yeah I was going to say there&#39;s probably an apex for when technology just becomes cumbersome and not actually an improvement on previous models but this isn&#39;t a phone I can compare it to🎉

👌🏾you can even take screenshots, with +volume and power button if I&#39;m not mistaken, feliz navidad Deej

This is my first smartphone so I don&#39;t really have anything to compare it to, the technology is literally Godlike and it hasn&#39;t given me any major problems, I recommend it and I would try to purchase it new

I remember when my dad upgraded to the S7 from his S3 and the camera was much faster than mom&#39;s S6

Still rocking the s7 edge 2017-present using android 10

boom boom

Why don&#39;t you give away your old phone to south?

Nice.video😅😅

A nostalgia now..what an iconic smartphone series it was

S7 2016 has better camera, sound and screen than my actual 2023 galaxy m23 ....

This phone is beautiful even in 2032

Damn, the change from back then to now is so huge😂😂😂😂😂😂we now waiting for the  s24 ultra

Why yt recommend me this to me in 2023

Well i have been recommended S5 today and now this Great to see where tech has gone

Looking back it was one of the worst phones I’ve owned. S8 though was one of the best as it didn’t really slow down.

Why is this getting recommended.

see this in 2023

I am still using the S7 and watching the video on it! 🤪

Why on earth is YouTube recommending a 7 year old video?

This phone was the bomb yo!🔥🔥🔥

Watching in my S23 Ultra to see how far we have reached so far.

7 YEARS LATER ❤🎉
PLEASE GET THIS INTRO BACKKK PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU
Yt recommended it to me idk why

Why the backlash from s6 to s7 didn&#39;t happen with the sd card slot in the s21

For some reason I thought this video was new. I’m in 2023

I am typing this on an s7 my grandma gave me. September 28, 2023

Watching this on my S23 feels weird. 😂

The camera was so good

Watch yo hands because sometimes it will burn

I ran a Galaxy S7 for 5 years, from 2016 to 2021. I ran it until the battery just plain wore out, and I couldn&#39;t get any more software upgrades. What a workhorse it was! I switched over to an iPhone XR in 2021, but the GS7 remains one of my favorite smartphones ever. Great review!

Nice

S7 was 7 years ago?!

Still more powerful than an iPhone 15 Pro Max

If you decide to get internet access the triangle with bars conveys signal strength and the number percentage has to do with battery percentage remaining, currently I think my device is connected to Spectrum or, &quot;Dead Internet theory&quot; is valid

Her King
Still want one

7 years ago, I saw the S7 review from your page and was encouraged to buy the S7 and I bought it
The S7 edge and the Note 7 was the nicest phone Samsung made

Nice bomb

This phone and its bigger brother s7 edge are one of the most beautiful phones samsung ever made.

Firestorm 2016

I have it

2023❤
Watching him doing the reviews in his bedroom, 7 years later in his studio🤝🏽🔥🔥🔥

Who else is here in 2023? Missing old times

Alright. Watching this today, March 28, 2023 8:51PM Philippines Standard Time 😂

Its already been 7 years, woah.

This was my first smartphone. The nostalgia is real 🥲

Old video..

Somebody from 2023 here?

me watching on my s7 its the best phone

Dad turns 6 year old baby into naughty leprechaun 😂😂😂

Samsung should make a phone like this again to go against the iPhone SE

Nice phone

This is probably one of the most revolutionary Samsung&#39;s of its time

Who’s here in 2023😅

Just traded mine in at Best Buy for the S21 FE...it was time.

Hi what type of USB port does this phone have?? Thank you

November 2022 and I&#39;m using my refurbished Samsung galaxy S7 😁
2022

Septembre 2022. Steel use it
They really should make an SE equivalent with this model, updated specs would be so good as my time with the S7 was probably the best I ever experienced with a smartphone although airpods on iOS has been very good.

Don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing here. But I&#39;m still enjoying the quality of the video. It was way ahead of it&#39;s time.

I&#39;m still using this phone. It&#39;s definitely getting slower with app progression but it still does what I need it to do.

Man, if only Samsung made a refresh of this just like how Apple made the iPhone SE 2nd and 3rd gen.I assure you that it would sell very well considering how good it looks, size, headphone jack and awesome display.

That&#39;s in better condition than mine

Ah summer 16 how I miss you

Who&#39;s here in 2022

Watching on the s22 plus amazing how far we came alao amaIng how this phone can run apex on lower settings  samsung really holds it down phone wise

Why is it that the galaxy s7 does NOT have shutter lag, whereas the latest and greatest s22 ultra does?

Wow i have that one two color black

Why is it being recommended now when even the last s7 must hv gone extinct

I am still using this phone in 2022!

wow

Watching this on s7 in 2022...😅

Who came back to this video in 2022? Just me?

Can’t wait for it

Holographic projection Androids and I Phones with three dimensional above screen animation coming someday, maybe sooner than we think.

Im still using the phone to this day

Holy shit time flies so fast. This already five years ago and nearing six. This was one of favorite smartphones ever!

I miss The good old days. It was awesome compact phone and still is👍

Good Job On The Video Marques Brownlee

Watching this in 2021 to compare the screen size of iphone SE. I had the s7 before and it was a pretty fun phone to use

I&#39;d still be rocking this phone now if it wasn&#39;t stolen from my house last year 😔

Ya boi is writing this on an s7 and it&#39;s battery life is soooo good like I swear once it held on for an hour on  0%!

<b>Add a public comment</b>

This comment is coming

YouTube recommend me after r years

2021

This is my first phone, and I remember opening the box I was so excited about it. And before I got it I watched this video like 20 times

This has my favorite ringtone

MKBHD&#39;s intro and outro hasn&#39;t changed at all in like half a decade 😲

remember Jesus and God loves you and remember Jesus die on a cross for our sins and rose again repent get saved he is coming soon God bless you all

There Youtube i watched it stop recommending it leave me alone!!

How many price this phone

Back glass cracks easily, screen cracks easily, screen burn in, overheats, battery life dropped quickly, charging port failed after a year. Worst phone ever

Im literally here because I just got a new phone. I&#39;ve had this since Dec 2016. Where does the time go... also How often do motherfuckers be upgrading phone?? Im I that out of touch lol. Im 28. Like, my shit works just fine...its got all the current apps... fast speed lol. I get feeling left behind when vhs went out and cds went out.. but like I didnt feel the need to upgrade, I was doing the same shit ppl with 2021 phones doing. Im only upgrading because I dropped it for the 4000th time and finally the screen is buggin

watching this review again to humble myself &lt;3

5 years later and I&#39;m still using the s7 edge lol great phone even in 2021

Infront

How comes it has no curved screen

My man really out here doing photo shoots with the phone. Hahaha

In my opinion the best phone I ever had, good camera, holds a lot of space, good looking, very resistant, nice battery life, way better compared to Huawei phones that you use for a few months and it starts lagging

Damn this phone looks beautiful to me even in 2021!  😍

Me on 2021:Watching this on my Galaxy S7 also.🤣I have it years and I only got minor scratches on the charging port. Aside from that it still looks new to me.🤣

Last normal phone of the series... Before fingerprint scanners went on the back, screen sizes exploded, multiple camera lenses came etc.

Anyone in 2020?

The days we cared about camera bumps and thickness 🥺

Imo , this and the S8 are the best phone designs

4 years and still rocking it.

I&#39;d rather have a phone i can take the back off

If we get Galaxy s7 with snapdragon 865 for 400$  in 2020 .. im sold!

Looking at this in 2020........

I don&#39;t know how YouTube&#39;s algorithm works

There&#39;s literally an election meltdown going on right now. *youtube, how about an old video of s7

My fav samsung design and who likes the coral blue in it😍😍😍😍

Back in the days, when you have single camera lens..

Recommend now in 2020 ?

I miss my S7 😭
I saw this phone on amazon is that where you got it?

Personally, I think this phone sucks. I use it, and I hate it. Don&#39;t buy it. I mean it. DON&#39;T BUY IT.Audio sucks, camera sucks, its not waterproof, INCREDIBLY LOWBATTERY LIFE, easily breakable, just don&#39;t buy.

I love s7 and I don&#39;t own one ,how much for one now

Ahh the S7, the one before they persuaded me to switch from iPhone.

Y ami seeing this in 2020😁!?

My s7 got so hot it burnt my blanket and I had to put it in the freezer so it wouldn’t catch on fire

I have like that to in 2020 but it&#39;s still working ❤️

Can&#39;t wait for my s7 to come thanks for the review

I wished for the S7 but got the S9+ and my tiny hands can barely grab the phone

Watching this on my note 20.

Nice

Wth is YouTube recommending this to me now🙄🙄

Kinda weird watching this review on a note 20 ultra

Watching on a S7

One day, you&#39;ll have to pay for headphone jack on a flagship.

He has a bomb

The S7 was such a great phone, wish we could stop making these huge and stupid phones and more sleek phones such as this.

I realized how advanced future phone are now

time has passed, hasn&#39;t it

So YouTube algorithm brought me here 🙄 4 years later

ITS OVER SAMSUNG S7 THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 HAS THE HIGHGROUND

Hello Future people 👽
I honestly prefer home buttons over no home buttons.  I miss having a home button.

Damn the old instagram logo 💀

Why the hack does youtube keep recomending this old crap to me?!

How the f has the quality been the same for 3 years. He is the definition of quality over quantity. 🤯🤯🤯

Still using galaxy S7 in mid 2020

Any body in 2020😂

Note 20 ultra: releasesMy wallet and the YouTube algorithm: <b>galaxy s7</b>

Right about time...

Yt&#39;s recommending me this in 2020 for some reason

Why??? Why does the YouTube Algorithm suggest this 4 years after release??

Watched this video on my s7 (2020)

S7 edge was the last BEST phone released by Samsung.

guys youtube recommended this to us now cz we can actually afford it now 😂 their a step ahead of us

Someone please explain this algorithm to me. PLEASE

So where can I buy this super phone?

watching in 2020

Samsung’s last butt ugly phone

Why was this recommended to me? I don&#39;t know.

This is comedy

Still rocking in 2020 😎😎

Why did this pop up on my feed.....

And 4 years later,. I guess Samsung will get rid that home button. And make their phones less  bezel

Thank you YT recommendation, very cool!

Why is this in my recommendation? More importantly, why am I watching this in 2020???

Can’t believe this was a top tier phone back then. My S7 is the most horrible phone I’ve ever used compared to an S9+.

I wonder why youtube suggested this video in 2020. Im still using a Note 5.

this vid made me remember Im using a 4 y.o. phone

samsung s series just nails in design 😘😘😘
oh dammit. i should have bought the s7 and not the s10e

Watching this in  2020

This phone is still great! Does everything perfectly well and can even play heavy games like pubgm

I have the note 20 ultra why am I seeing this 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Recommended in 2020🤔

Why YouTube why???

The review still looks fresh.

Came here just for the sake of nostalgia😂

Just like the Iphone SE 2, I hope Samsung bring this back with upgraded internal and bezel less design. Make it 499 dollars. It will be a hit.

Who watching in 2020

Hmm. Why is it recommend now tho? 🤔

Watching this on an s20 plus. How weird these old phones are so small.

Phones have really changed in design in just 4-5 years.

better autofocus than the s20 ultra. wtf samsung

Haha. I rocked this phone back in the days.

<b>Smol boi</b>

I&#39;m fro. Future and have the note 20

S7?

Youtube algorithm chillin&#39;

Bruh my phone thanks for recommending it now after so many years

&quot;So ive been using this phone for four years now&quot;

Why now ?O_o

I used the Galaxy S7 for four years.  I bought and returned 4 phones during that time. Nothing could replace the easy one-handed operation 577ppi work horse that seemed just as fast as phones 3 generations later. I loved the LED indicator light. The Galaxy S10e is not as good as the GS7 in a number of ways (YouTube videos actually smaller and grainier on phone 3 generations newer! Crazy). Anyway, many things perfect about that little phone. It will be missed.

Youtube: &quot;There you go, a phone that you can afford&quot;

Haha, hi there 2020 xD

Pixel 4a: 12MP is still plenty

Is this phone good for gaming??

Hey Guys, MP PHD here

It will fit in my budget after 5 years from now though 🙃🚕Asmit.

I&#39;ve got this beauty and thinking about switching  to pixel 4a but have some serous doubts, what do you guys  think? It is worth it? :)

Literally watching that in 2020 using my s7 after my 2020 phone died :/ Thx YouTube for recommending it, that helped me to know the phone specs again:)

Its 2020 , August 😒 why this video is in my suggestion

Anyone got this recommended in 2020?

Watching this in 2020 on my s7 :)

Not a lot of good if you haven&#39;t had an S6 before.

YouTube is weird.

The biggest difference:IT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK !!!

2020

S20ultra is released.You tube: this is best time for  recommending 😎😎

I had forgotten phones had home buttons...

Hey. Do you do “long term reviews”? I’d like to try an android phone... but I don’t want to spend over 1000 for a good phone.. which is 1500 in Australia.

The fact that my midrange phone is better than this

damn, i actually watched this video when it first came out, its crazy how the time passes by

Wtf youtube

This recommendation only coming up now?.

I just broke it a month ago

Anyone, 2020... 7...August..?
Wow so my phone is as old as young mkbhd

Ok so I am watching in 2020 and this is still a good phone.Well when I was 6 my dad had enough money to buy this phone and he bought 2, one for him and one for me. But my dad didn&#39;t have enough for another S7 so he bought the S6 Edge for my sister.Me and my dad both got the like 8k gold version, same for my sister for her edge.

I can&#39;t afford this phone even in 2020

Back when phone makers didn’t try to remove the jack and make bezels as tiny as possible...

Watching shits of 4 years ago 😂

I am watching this video today in July 30, 2020

I got my dads galaxy s7 when he upgraded to the galaxy s20. I was expecting to be jealous or disappointed that I didnt get the s20, but I haven&#39;t been feeling that way since I got it. It&#39;s an awesome phone. The only complaint I have is that the display has a few burn ins from when it was my dads. But other than that it&#39;s still an awesome phone in 2020.

Why do i get this recommended 😂

2020?

When YouTube recommends this video again!

Watching this on my S 10 plus in 2020

Why is this in my recommended

Really?? YouTube recommended this video after 4 years!😑

What? Use it at the beach is no deal? What? Waterproof? Quality tech videos for you

Watching on my Samsung s|||
Bada-bing badaboom that phone goes BOOM

I don&#39;t know about other S7s, but mine was defective. I have generally had a good experience with Samsung, so I pre ordered the S7 and by the time I got the phone the nightmare started. It overheated so much all the time and it went crazy with auto restarts and other weird stuff. I had it for about 5 months; most of the time it was in repairs because they refused to replace it. Later, I just couldn&#39;t cope with having a phone that can only be used for 10 minutes before turning into a piece of lava, going crazy and auto-restarting, so I threw it away. The S7 was basically the single worst experience I ever had with a phone in my life.P.S. after throwing it away, I got an LG G6 and lived happily ever after :)

Watching this on my s20, the heck is the youtube algorithm doing

I got s20 get in my level
lol

Anyone here in 2020😂

And again

2020 YouTube recommendations?

Nobody:YouTube recommending me this is 2020

Now we got the s20 lol

Why is YouTube recommending this to me ?

Mkbhd 2016:3000mah is so big Mkbhd 2020:5000mah is so big

Youtube : We&#39;re Just A Little Late Just A Little I Mean 4 Years Isn&#39;t Alot Is It?  Let&#39;s Recommend This...

why would YouTube recommend this to me now?

Just switched from an S7 to an S20 Ultra 6 days ago. How times have changed.

I love mkbhd, but why was I recommended this?

2020///

who’s watching this in 2020?

Cant wait for Galaxy s8

Ah yes, YouTube recommendations back at it again

Who else is here in 2020?

ohh...after 4 yrs

Nice phone. I am gonna get it tomorrow.

Ah yes, reccomended in 2020

Watching on my Galaxy S7 now. I just love this phone. but I do need a new one for every one. Cracked the front screen over a year ago no selfie camera now. Doesn&#39;t bother me at all but would like an updated cell phone.

Damn 2020
This is my dads phone 🤣🤣 my phone is the s20 ultra

Heyy corona virus sucks

Why YouTube?

Reccomended this nowThis phone is so old I use it as an MP3 player

Thanks YouTube recommends I can finally afford a galaxy s7.

2016: s7 - 3000mah battery2019: s10e 3100 mah batterybruh
Lol the old instagram app

i guess YouTube wants me to buy a s7

Dude Ur holding a bomb

I have the j2...

I can say as a person who has used the S7 I can say the buttons not being on one side is annoying. It makes it hard to pick a side when the buttons are on both sides. When gaming or watching videos in your hand it gets annoying when no matter how you hold it , there is a button on your palm. The Samsung Galaxy A20 has the buttons all on one side and it makes it easy to use it when gaming or watching videos. The buttons face up so you don&#39;t feel them.

Ewww. When u compare this with note 20/10. Or even the A series

If you told me this hahaha
Look who is this 😵

When youtube recommends this video 4 years after it&#39;s been uploaded

Here i am getting youtube recommendation again...😆😆 😃

I&#39;m going to leave this here until Youtube recommends this 70 years in the future

Me sitting here watching from the iphone11 that I upgraded from my s7. I do kinda miss android ngl

Cool phone! Can&#39;t wait for me to get it!

Yesterday my galaxy S7 got stolen, bros.. hold me

ik il my sc phone c4
<a href="">1:36</a> I lost my galaxy S7 when it slipped out of my pocket 😅

I still have this one. Great phone

I have this from T-Mobile. Problem is the battery life is not so great. Maybe it&#39;s Android 8 or maybe it&#39;s the bloatware that are installed by Samsung/T-Mobile. Either way the battery life is not good. Plus the phone overheats when web surfing or watching YouTube. The camera and water proofing is great. But when it comes to battery life then it&#39;s less than ok.

Quick note here. The next note version will be explosive

YouTube algorithm: Suprise madafaka

AYYYYY! DAS MY PHONE!!!! I have it. I win.

I have had a Nexus 6 for several years now and love it.Lately it getting hot and bumping me off. I carry insurance with T-Mobile and they are exchanging it for the Galaxy S7.I noticed you said the audio wasn&#39;t that good. Can anyone tell me a little more?I notice the S7 has a battery and the Nexus 6 doesn&#39;t.I really like this phone but they don&#39;t make them any longer.Any help would be appreciated

when youtube suddenly reccomends this video about a phone from 4 years ago

When you come here for that wallpaper

anyone know how the display quality would compare with an iPhone 11? for example when watching a yt video what does the quality naturally fall under? trying to decide whether or not to switch back to iOS

I&#39;m watching this from my new s7

Who&#39;s watching this with a Samsung s7?

Kaboom

Samsung: buy new s20Me: watching this video in 2020 on s7...

Ok so my dad is giving me a hand me down! Yay!!! (We do that alot because we arent rich) I have a Samsung J3pop right now. Which is getting slow and the battery doesn&#39;t last long. So I&#39;m hoping the S7 Edge will be a good improvement! !

This was my dream phone but at the end i got a s8 😆

Watching this on s7 in 2020

Why does this era of phones feel so ancient when it was only like over 3 years ago

Welp I&#39;m back here again

Youtube recomending this video in 2020. Does Google know im broke?

Nah, I&#39;ll skip it. I need a quad camera setup without bezels &amp; 120hz display. Let me know whenever that comes on a phone.

I once had one

This was the phone that brought me over to android/Samsung

Fact: this was recommended to you in 2020

I&#39;ve had my S7 for 4 years now and i just learned it has wireless charging.🙄

Woahhh recommendation of YouTube is messed up

How dated it looks... Jeeeez, its ONLY 4 years old. Damn. You dont even see how things age until you see them again...

youtube in 2020:

My mom is still using it. It is an amazing phone 😍📱

I&#39;ve officially watched this video 28 times because of youtube algorithm

whats up with the algorithm?

Me: searching for good video to watch about phones on my S9+ in 2020.Youtube: if you like phones check out S7

Same here

Yo pierre, you wanna come out here

Hey youtube. I already bought this phone. Four years ago.... STOP RECOMMENDING IT

watching this on my brand new s20

So YouTube is what 5 years late

Why was this just recommended to me?

Just upgraded from this to the oneplus7 pro

Don&#39;t mind me I just came because this got recommended 4 years later

Still have it as back up, such a great phone

See you again in 5 years later when this video get Recommended again.

It’s May 2020 during coronacation. I have a pixel 3a coming in the mail tomorrow. Idk why this is in my recommended, but ngl I’m ok with it. I love me some MKBHD content.

always liked the s7edgebut never knew the 7 generally was even this goodwell they&#39;re both basically the same so I see now

Watching this on a Note 10+ in 2020, during the pandemic....

I like this version of TouchWiz the most (design wise)

I remember this

YouTube go home, you&#39;re drunk!

YouTube recommend this video again at 2020 🤔 Alas what memories ❤️

Guess what? Yeah you&#39;re right: YouTube recommendation

Anyone else upgraded from S7 to S10 and found out that S7 has better camera and display?

Why did yt recomend this in 2020 🤣

this was on my recommended in 2020.i used to have the edgebut it rokeidont recommend it i reccomend normal oan s8

Wtf yputube

Watching on my S7 in 2020 😎

Thanks but I think I&#39;ll stick to my S20 ultra😏

Geico😂😂😂
A lot has changed in 3 years

2015:- 3000 mah huge!! 🔥2020:- 6000 mah huge 🔥🔥😂
It&#39;s sad that Samsung still makes new phones that are just as powerful as this Galaxy S7...( Like the Galaxy A71) ...

This was my first &quot;expensive&quot; phone. Bought one brand new in April 2017. Broke the charger port two years later, went to a Moto G7. Was looking for ways to access the data still on the phone. Didn&#39;t discover the wireless charging until I was pricing repairs for it.

Galaxy S5 was my first &quot;falgship&quot; phone and it started at 499.00 at release. And I bought it at RadioShack. My how times have changed.

The last S series device with a front home button.

Watching this in an S7

It&#39;s 2020 and the S7 I own still competes with today&#39;s flagships

Watching on S7 edge😁

Bruh it&#39;s 2020 why is this recommended to me

Switched from the s7 edge to an iphone a while back, but I really loved this phone so much! Had for about 4 years. Dropped it a bunch if times on hard surface, the toilet, and the pool but it held up pretty well! The one phone that I actually didn’t break.

Lmao XD, im watching this video for 2 reasons. I&#39;m a fan of the channel. And this is the phone I have. And the slippery part is my favorite part of the phone, XD.

Galaxy s7 in 2020Awesome divice still we can use it!!! ;display incredible,2k resolution also working!!!!No more complaints!Apple 6s or 7+ in 2020Bad display ; bad battery life; always heating on mobile dataIf 6s user: fu*k*** bull sh** divice!

Used it for about 1,5 year and can honestly recommend to everyone. Now the phone seems to be cheap especially used one. Things that get old in this one is battery and the speaker, thats why I consider changing to OP 5T. Other than that there is no lagging  or random resetting .The phone is solid I would say. One thing to add is the touch ID, I think it&#39;s better on the back than front, at least for me it used to work better.

Yeah I&#39;m here in mid 2020 because you know, YouTube

Instagram looks so weird

better than new se iphone?

2020 still using this phone

Why is YouTube recommending me a 4 year old phone review-

Can i ask what type of camera do you use for youtube, nice video quality!!

That’s the phone I’m using.....

Bruh I have this phone. I had no idea it was water proof so I accidentally dropped it in my cereal and thought it was broken. Now I just saw this video.😂Im late ik sorry

This is still my daily driver

They went from great improvements to dropping one of the  shittiest phones ever (s20 ultra)

Wow it looks like The S7 edge beat the s20 ultra when it comes to auto focus speed.

still watching with my s7 this April 2020   😪

Still using this one in mid april 2020. Although the battery life is a little weaker now, it&#39;s still working just as well as before. I haven&#39;t had any problems with this phone. It&#39;s been great all the way.

I watch this wich a s7

watching this on an s7 in 2020 and still love it, the only one downside 4 years later is the internal storage, but i got an sd card ;) .

The 2017 intro tho

YouTube algorithm: time for you to watch marques&#39;s review of the s7.Me: WOW!

there only one sim card port

Watching this on my Galaxy S10 in 2020

Why was a recommended a phone I trashed 3 months ago?

i made my s7 vid before you lol but its cringy so dont watch

Had this phone for a year and a half. Absolutely loved it. Honestly miss it sometimes. I got the Galaxy S20 now. The Galaxy S7 is an amazing phone. One of the best phones I&#39;ve ever had.

My s7 back is creacked is it still water proof

Watching on a S7 in 2020

Watching it on my s20 cloud blue 💙 😍

S7 is a legemdary phone. Is was so perfect when it came out. I kinda miss the home button

A rushed review, almost nothing about the interface. You basically only covered build quality, battery and a bit about the camera.

Great everybody upgrade their phone, now i can afford this s7

omg imagine if you replace stuff inside this with today&#39;s tech (⊙_⊙)

watching this on my galaxy s29

one of the best phones of all times

This is such a good phone that if I destroy it Ima just buy another one! Samsung&#39;s best imo

I love getting recommended 4 year old videos

Anyone watching on galaxy s7?

If you want a cheaper samsung get the note 8 there not cheap but not expensive there sick for gaming and have face I&#39;d

I lost my s10 E so now I have a note 8

Using Samsung Note 10 plus from 11 march 20 &amp; S7 edge since 27.03. 2016

S7 looks amazing

YouTube hitting me with the throwbacks this week

Camera still feels better than the s8 and s9

Today in March 2020 I still enjoy both the phone and the camera of my S7 Edge, which is preferable to the plain S7. All the rest being about equivalent. And everything is still fast and works flawlessly.

You mean the Galaxy S Bomb?

I still use my gallaxy s7
I&#39;m complaining about my s9 and watching this makes me appreciate it again

True Classic tbh

It&#39;s still my phone Still going strong
My first flagship phone and it will always have a place in my heart. Because of my mom and how she sacrificed her time to get me it. Thank you mom

S20 is better

2020: Still using it and love it! No lag, no burnin, easily handling PUBG and CoD. Only minus I can think of is a decreased battery life, but it&#39;s got fast charging and wireless charging so it&#39;s never a bother to top it up. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not open for an upgrade. It&#39;s just that no newer phone can do something that s7 can&#39;t. 120 hz display on the s20 is the only thing that could change that, but the design of s20 is a huge turn off for me. Guess I&#39;m gonna have to wait for S30 or whatever they gonna call it.

Why is this in my recommanded?

That&#39;s fire🔥 Litteraly.
Just appeared on my home page

S20 ultra
S20 is now on the marketYouTube recommendations: Want a phone you can actually buy with your budget?Edited: Wow thank you for the likes! S22 is coming soon and this is still in my recommendations. 😂😂😂

S7 looks great! Let&#39;s see what Samsung&#39;s gonna do with the note 7

Here in 2020 on my s7. The one thing I don&#39;t like about it is that it&#39;s battery life (since I&#39;ve had it for 4 years) is garbage, it barely lasts 3 hours with typical use

why do i keep getting recommendations to old tech (although, it&#39;s not that old)

iPhone 11 Pro Max here, maybe I need the s7 tho 😏

Dumpster Baby

Watching on my s7. Solid phone, the best phone I&#39;ve had

I&#39;ll wait for the S8.

YouTube algorithm knows i can&#39;t afford the S20.

Hi people !
after 3 years of service on my Galaxy S7, i can say that it has been my top 3 phones of all time. paid $700 cash in a store (unlocked ofc) as my SONY Z3 was dying and i have absolutely no regrets, even though i bought it a month before the S8 came to market.1: Nokia  6230i2: Samsung Galaxy S73: Samsung Galaxy S3

I had this phone four month back then before it got stolen from me and bought s8 which i still have it.

March 2020 and I&#39;m still using this phone. It&#39;s great.

Why am I here?

Yeah let&#39;s recommend this to him. That&#39;ll do

YouTube we get this my 4th video you have recommended that is over 2 years old

<a href="">1:32</a> &quot;This has slipped out of my pocket in a car multiple times.&quot;Yup. That&#39;s how I ended up running over it and cracking the back glass. I loved that phone...

Who&#39;s here After the recommendation

How do the s7 photos look good there I dont see the point of a s20 ultra much anymore

Fabulous presentation. Thank you.😊

Im here before it hits 5M views lol

Watching this on s7 edge in 2020 and it&#39;s still working perfectly

Just bought the s20 ultra Youtube: Hey check out the s7!

S7 edge in 2020, best phone
<a href="">1:08</a> ah made in philippines, a place where im from. weeehoo

Watching this on a S7 in 2020 :D I still love it

Wow the last flagship samsung phone !!!!!😲🤣

The fact that it is 2020 and YouTube recommendes this to me after 3 years

YouTube just recommends this video again while watching it on my s7 phone.

Muhhh BABY
Why did I just get this recommended then 😂😂

2020 and I&#39;m watching this on a S7 edge

a good phone

just saw the s8 review also from Marqueswhat a jump samsung made in a yearalso Marques, what a jump he made in a year

ill stick with my S20+ 5G

Lol why did yt only just recommend this to me when the beast of the Galaxy S20 ultra is out now and I&#39;m watching a S7 review

Who&#39;s watching in 2020 on there Iphone 6s on IOS 11?

SAMSUNG galaxy s7edge ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It&#39;s sad how this is better than my current phone

Why is this in my reccomendation after 4 years

watching this video from a samsung s6...

Just bought one today off Kogan I’m upgrading from an iPhone 5

Back in the days when phones were rocking their single camera😘

thank you YouTube algorithms

What is the bag on the intro?

How did u get the S7 without the side edges?!?! Does the S7 only come as the S7 Edge?? I&#39;ve never seen a flat screened Samsung S7

This is only 3 years ago but it looks so damn primitive compared to the s10

Sadly most of the videos that are reviewed about these devices are too quick and not very in-depth. A lot of people have to constantly stop the video to see exactly how they need to set their device &amp; capture the picture they want to take.I think I&#39;m going to do a nice deep Long slower review in reference to this device and how to set the ideal settings in Pro mode instead of automatic mode to capture those beautiful sunsets and sunrises and flowers and scenes in general.

When you take enough time to dive into the camera settings it is amazing what you can actually capture on the phone especially in panorama mode. To those who don&#39;t know the phone&#39;s potential, Pro Mode really is a lot of fun. I see so many people with other phones especially Apple who cannot take beautiful deep textured sunsets or sunrises on their device because  all the settings are fixed. The ISO is to high, HDR is automatic and blows out the deeper colors. I currently live in a National Park so I am surrounded by hundreds of opportunities.

im thinking of buying this, cause its a good cheap phone that works really well (i want a phone with a home button) also cause my other phone broke

It&#39;s 2020. And I&#39;m still using s7 edge. 😀
I bought s7 edge exactly 3 years ago and I still have it

Watching on my galaxy s7 😍😍😍
bring back the 20syl intro music

Watching this on my s10 plus

It&#39;s junk, don&#39;t waste your money, it doesn&#39;t charge half the time.

Watching in 2020, because YouTube algorithm

Was running with it in my pocket and it hit the concrete and the back has now gotten cracks which sucks but I&#39;ve dropped it and it&#39;s fine that&#39;s the only time it actually got cracked

Even back then...iPhones were better

you came a long way to the note 10 my man

I can afford this now. ^^

see you guys in 3 years!

Why am I here in 2020. Google?

Someone in 2020, PS The s20, s20 + and s20 ultra is out. 😊

So this is just in my recommended 3 years after the phone came out.

The best smartphone ever made!

S20 ultra is here and youtube recommends S7

2020 and watching this using my samsung s7 which I have since 2016. 😉

Who else using s7 in 2020 ? 💥💥
YouTube recommended........

Y

I also have an S7 now
still a beast I&#39;m still using it i rooted and updated it to pie one UI

It&#39;s shit, don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s very slippery

It&#39;s very thin

I got that but mine is gold

Watching this in my note 10+ for some reason

Watching this on s7 in 2020😶

Why pass the Ball when you can pass Away?  Kobe 2020

Why am I watching this right now lol

Wait a minute... Just yesterday I sold my s7 edge and bought a note 10 plus and this video is appearing out no where for me. Google is really taking this to an extreme level.

I&#39;m still using this phone about 2 and half year. Only problem was home button&#39;s top layer scratched, but fingerprint reader works well. IP68 is now broken, some sensors malfunctions when I tried to wash my phone. I have 32 GB version so it&#39;s low capacity nowadays, but the SD Card slot is so good option. I&#39;ve accidentally dropped my phone many times on the floors, roads, stairs but there is no display scratch, back glass scratches. So good phone, but I&#39;ve planned to purchase my next phone, the OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro will be my choice.

Ok YouTube. I see how it is in 2020Imma see this in 2025 next time

Where my S10 gang at???
So if I stream Youtube for hours I should skip this phone because it&#39;ll overheat?

Watching this on s8

Watching on my s8

Man this was a great phone...

Who watching this on an S7 2020?

Intro song is goof

2020 and still using s7😂

<a href="">1:05</a> that backpack is made in the Philippines

I just barely upgraded from the s7 to the s9 lol

The battery sucks - this is my 3rd time replacing.  Has not pulled through for me when I needed it.  I can&#39;t fit too many apps on the phone or it slows down the phone a lot.

Great detailed review young man! Thank you.

This phone is amazing.

I have this phone as a spare now, but is pretty awesome when I used it more.

Whatching a galaxy s7 review on my galaxy s7😂🤣

I’ve dropped my s7 in the toilet twice and it’s still held up fine lol. My only complaint is the battery.

This is my dream phone!! :)

I have a friend with that phone

2019 and still using s7 lol 😂😭Edit* 5 month later. I got the samsung s20 ultra but still gonna keep s7 as second phone and for memory haha it started legging really bed and I have to constantly charge cause it doesn&#39;t even last more then 2 hours and it freezes up and get hella hot , had to move on. But s7 was a great phone!.

This mble water proof...😘😘

youtube out here recommending this again lmao

Me planning to get a s10YouTube:- s7 Isn&#39;t a bad deal

Watching on my s7 edge in 2019

Watching this on my s7edge😂

Watching this on my s10

I had this phone for almost 2yrsIts the second best samsung phone after galaxy note 4AlsoWho is seeing this in 2019?

Is the s7 edge still worth it

I have the iphone 11 now, but I had bought this phone when it relesed.

still use this phone till this day and its greatthe edge*

I have an S4 mini, should I go for this one for US$100 or s8 for US$200 (second hand prices)? I like compact phones.

I have the S5, I&#39;m gonna get this! XD

Still rocking this phone in 2019! Other than slightly degraded battery life (yes I know this happens to every battery ever) it&#39;s been excellent.

watching old reviews to kill that fucking &quot;i need a new phone-autism&quot;😂😂

who is watching with me in 2019?

This or a30

Had the S7 Edge Gold till last year. Still one of the most gorgeous looking phone.

I broke my s8+ so now I&#39;m getting a s7

Markass brownie

I really miss the home screen button..

Yeah, my S7&#39;s battery only lasts about an hour....

watching this on my s10 , lmao

low light pictures still ABSOLUTELY suck in 2019

Let m guess half of you are watching this on a galaxy S7 so funny

Me: Watches one old videoYouTube:

my s7 heats up after awhile:/

Is it a set for sweat hands people?

was looking over your review  and noticed that you finger print (<a href="">3:29</a>) on the phone is solid enough for pulling your print for a database search. just so you know

Am buying one next month

Is watching videos on YouTube good quality?

This is a very intelligent person that&#39;s doing this description of the phone I live in the southeastern United States and in the state of Georgia this guy will be called a Tom by the way he speaks he speaks very eloquently professionally and ask command of the English language you would not believe how many people live here I hear everyday you can understand because they speak Ghetto speak

Watching this on a s10 but had a s7 before, weird looking at its review couple years back

Still rocking s7 ,❤️👌..I love flat display
watching this on my s10+ 🤣 &amp; his review on the s7 edge still convinces me to buy one lol

Watching this for some reason on my s10

This phone slows down so fast. In comparison, my oneplus 3 from the same year performs much faster.

Accidental home button presses ? How the hell is that possible. 2nd: the home button on the s7 is about 10% larger than on the s6. So, what u say makes no sense.

it’s 2019 i have the iPhone X but y’all don’t understand how much i miss this phone

its really good i got it used yesterday but i cant install apps

Marques your room is too cramped you should probably get yourself a studio the size of a warehouse

i lost my phone 2 days ago so i&#39;m here mourning :(<b>typing from laptop</b>

can i get the phone? x)

Well shit, YouTube here we go again in 2019 😂

It&#39;s crazy how phones have changed in 3 years

Oh shit your black!

I am enjoying his hair. Damn how times have changed

Is this phone still supported by Samsung?

After getting an s6 recommendation, I get the s7 recommendation... in 2019, nice. Still a great video

I still using s7 edge with the pink line on the screen.

Watching it from s10+

2019 and this phone is still good.

Terrorists:we want you!

I come back to these videos just so I can see IG in chronological order

Youtube recommends me this. Yay !Shit. 🙄

why is youtube recommending MKBHD&#39;s old videos. not complaining just wondering

YouTube is making us watch every single MKBHD video ever uploaded

this is the best design ever

I might be switching from this to the Note X+ you reviewed...not sure if should wait for something better though

Keep getting these old videos recommended..I keep watching them, YouTube keeps recommending them..doh.

When 3000 mAh was considered &quot;large&quot; 3 years ago

I have a s6 and still rlly good

Markass Brownie

Its 2019 and I&#39;m watching this on my S8 lol!!

I&#39;m watching this on my S10

What does that shirt mean? A garbage truck and a kid on a swing? There has to be some meaning behind it.

Watching this on my S10+ 😂

Still probably the best Samsung phone imo

Watching this after after i got recomanded the s6 review.

3 years ago? It feels like just yesterday, damn.

Basically it’s shit

Watching it on my s10+ lol.

Watching it using my nokia

<b>Proceeds to watch on an S10</b>

I had a Galaxy s7 pretty hood for size

<a href="">1:08</a> Made in Philippines AYOOO PHILIPPINES REPRESENT LOLOLOL

Watching this video on my S10+ lol

It&#39;s so crazy seeing how fast this phone used to be. Before I upgraded to an S8+ my S7 slowed down so badly it played PoGO at like 10-15 frames a second and would freeze constantly.

I got samsung A3
S7 is butt

Recommended 😈

why the fuck is this in my youtube recommendations when i own a galaxy S10+??

Why YouTube why?Why would I like to watch it in 2019?

Still own this phone, the photos are still amazing on this

YouTube&#39;s shitty algorithm brought me here... 3 years too late. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Been using this phone for more than 3 years, and dAMMN is this phone indestructible.😂 I&#39;ve dropped this phone abt a hundred times and still zero stretches, zero cracks.  Overall, I&#39;d said it&#39;s a pretty great phone and it has certainly exceeded my expectations. Battery length is still good as new even after so many years. Size is perfect for me, not too bulky, not too thick or small. Camera quality is excellent. Functions work efficiently and smooth, good speed. If you&#39;re looking for a durable phone with longevity in mind, this phone is a great pick!Would definitely recommend to other people.(if they weren&#39;t so put-off by what an old model it is.😂)

The upgrade over the years is amazing. You did well man. I miss my S7 low-key. #2019

Algorithm unites us once again.

It&#39;s funny coz I was in the poolside and I had my s7 and I kicked It into the pool when it fell from my hands and saved it lol

Anyone 2019?

This phone has higher resolution then Note 10

This phone was one of my favorite phones

Watching on my s7 edge 😂🤣
Bezel talk was barely even a thing.

And heres Galaxy Note 10

9 aug..2019...🤪
How basic does this phone look in 2019 :)

Still a great vid, oh how things have changed in 3 years.Video idea: compare the S7 to the S10 2019 edition.

I am Bangladesh

Watching this on a s10+

Does this phone have mobile hot spot?

He have problem when you drop him

Nobody: YouTube: 🤷🏾‍♂️S10: am I a joke to you
Watching on my s6
