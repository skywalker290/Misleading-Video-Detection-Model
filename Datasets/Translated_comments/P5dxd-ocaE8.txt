sup Markass

i seriously miss youtube rewind. it was just a great celebration of the platform and its creators. all they need to do is not make it woke and cringey and just get back to what used to make it popular.

fortnite

We all agree Youtube rewind 2018 is cringe-worthy. All The dislikes because too much liberation nonsense. Maybe nextime youtube rewind should respecting religious people because they do exists.

Even the guy who Will Smith wanted hates Rewind

The only thing i remember about 2017 is all my friends trying to mumble the lyrics of despacito 😂

Thank you Marques! Rewind videos have come to feel easier to understand for me now! Raza :)

<a href="">3:42</a> u

Love ❤️😘
Gotta love that Vulf intro!

I found you because of YouTube Rewind.

ReWind 2018 have past with now 20M

Markass brownlee

I finally know why youtube’s new update took away the dislike count on every video

Mark Ass Brownie

<b>Makass brownee</b>

Well, they definitely aren’t putting Will Smith in a rewind any time soon now!

&quot;Hey Will, if you&#39;re watching this, I would love to collab.&quot; hehe

Marques there’s a rewind in 2010 too. That was the first one. Not the 2011

<a href="">8:30</a> &quot;Mark Ass Brownie&quot;

youtube and google, will, fundamentally never understand their consumers from their ivory tower.

You know capitalism is a cool thing... allows us to compete in a market and such... the problem is there comes a point where the stuff created is the product of numbers on a spreadsheet in an attempt to maximize profit. There&#39;s no real soul to it. It&#39;s just content created for the sake of content. I feel this is sadly the trend that content creators go through as they grow, they try to maximize audience and profit to the point where their big-budget videos feel scripted and robotic whereas their older content from waaaay back in the day has a charm to it because it was just them with their camera messing around with their friends.

Don&#39;t know what it is, but I&#39;m watching your videos backwards (and I&#39;m already here haha late 2018) and this is the best looking frame in a while. Every single one of the others are perfect, don&#39;t get me wrong, but this one... I don&#39;t know what it is, but is crispy as hell (more than usual) and also this depth of field... hope you see this, and remember what is is, to tell me and to also make more, just beautiful!

Its sad that youtube has stopped making them now :(

I just heard about YouTube rewind for the first time just now and came here because the dislike button is removed and people are talking about YouTube trying to pull the wool over some eyes, anyone know what the heck is going on?? I will petition to get the dislike button renewed

THIS WHY AM HERE BECAUSE THEY REMOVE THE DISLIKE FEATURE really messed up they hide the truth of how we feel and think WE HATE GAY GAYS AND AND THERE WAYS SINNERS TO GOD government are  devil worshipers seriously

No matter whether the rewind is the most hated thing on YouTube, you&#39;ll never be hated Marques!

20M dislikes and going, until they removed the dislike counter this year.

Another problem is that the videos that are popular at one time in a year, will not age well towards the end of the year. and people might get so sick of seeing it that they would hate it. like gangnam style was cool in the beginning then made everyone hate it when it was over played. and a lot of youtube videos cater to specific people, you cant have everyone like everything

how come today is the 1st time i ever heard of YouTube Rewind

Oh! And now the dislikes ratio is hidden from viewers... Funny, almost in time to &quot;get used to it&quot; prior to the release of the latest Rewind. Not fishy at all. Am I right?

⚠️JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN⚠️
&quot;Mark Ass Brownlee&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂

return youtube dislike (dot) (c) (o) (m)Keep the ball rolling

Why YouTube Rewind 2018 has many dislikes?

You missed the 2010 rewind.

What I would want in rewind is fortnite and marles brownlee

Woke Left.
BROWN ASS MARK LEE

Give rewind link in description so we can dislike
PewDiePie&#39;s rewind is way better than YouTube&#39;s one

Take notes YouTube.

Youtube became shit. THAT&#39;S what as happened. The golden era of Youtube and the Internet is gone- now it&#39;s basically creepy Youtube kid&#39;s channels and makeup drama and complete garbage.

Revisiting this video to note that if I controlled rewind I would still have Fortnite and Markass Brownlee

So I&#39;ve been hearing Markass Brownie for about a week now and here are my thoughts

YouTube got so frustrated with the REWIND, that they didn&#39;t even do it this year...

This guy will review anything

Why the video length appears <a href="">11:11</a> while loading but becomes <a href="">11:10</a> after the load

john pinette
youtube rewind 2020 was so shit

The comments: fOrTnItE

Youtubes solution for 2020 was to cancel it. Good job youtube

Who else is looking for will smith in the comment section 👇

Markass Brownie

YouTube tried to do the watch mojo list in 2019 🤣

2018: makes a bad video  and people don’t like it2019: makes a watch mojo  people don’t like it2020: just quits

They featured Liza who hadn&#39;t uploaded in 9 months &amp; Lilly who posted a &#39;leaving youtube for a while&#39; video. Instead of featuring all those who posted daily throughout 2018.

2 years later and I JUST got they were referencing fortnite...bruh

This video is to show that MKBHD is genuine and awesome reviewer.

He said this and he isn’t in YouTube rewind 2019 lol

marqass brownie haha ​​funni
Guess who is not featuring in the rewind next year because he said the truth...

Rewind might be the reason why YouTube started these double unskippable ads

Marquez: even if we add everyone want on youtube rewind its just hard to watchPewdie Gang: huh pathetic

I think instead of leaving him out of rewind, they should have listened to him

Two years later. Did you see a difference?

Will smith: i want fortnite and Markass Brownlee

New Rewind is basically pointer of pointers to best videos for advertising.

When I got this recommendedMy mind: It&#39;s rewind time

2011 was actually the second rewind.

Youtube Rewind2011: simple |\/2018: Markass Brownee &amp; fortNite

YouTube: &quot;So in 2019, let&#39;s see what you like&quot;Everyone: &quot;we like to copy and paste other people&#39;s comments&quot;

How many of you noticed that the length of the video is <a href="">11:11</a>

Bruh.... who disliked that video

Ryan higa moment was crazy😂

Imagine not disliking yt ⏪

2 years have (almost) pasted, and now they aren&#39;t even making a rewind

Okay so now is the time for arbitrary  recommendations from youtube, but this is actually just before next rewind video

who&#39;s here after YouTube rewind 2020 got cancelled?

This is great that he actually spoke the truth

markass

2018.Good times

Was this shot on the Helios?

I WOULD WANT FORTNITE AND MARKASS BROWNLEE

Perfect time to recommend this one again 😂😂

They just cancelled for this year.

If this year&#39;s YouTube rewind starts with a scene of PewDiePie and T-series,  that would be lit

Imagine youtube rewind 2020

I came here because of Will Smith saying  “mark ass brownie”

While I get where you&#39;re coming from, I think I disagree with the cutting down on the number of creators and trends. That would probably just make more people disappointed that they didn&#39;t see their favorite creator in the Rewind. Like you said, the Rewinds of 2013, 14 and 15 were loved even though they too had a lot going on. Things that people seem to dislike the most are prioritizing celebrities over Youtube creators, adding emotional segments which may feel disingenuous or politically motivated to some, ignoring some of the biggest events in the Youtube community, and of course leaving out some of the biggest and most loved creators. Obviously there&#39;s also the issue of Youtube trying to make advertisers happy so it&#39;s definitely not an easy fix.

Funny how youtube demonitized this video

People who disliked this video are people who liked rewind 2018

I can&#39;t stop staring at his forehead.LoL

No one: Not even Escobar:Not even PewDiePie:Will smith: Markass BrownieYoutube: That seems family friendly!

What’s his age

Hi mark ass brownie

Quiver 2 😂😂🙏
Honestly I&#39;m pretty worried for the future of rewind because the negativity is insane from people and youtubers supporting it,I dont have any hate on anyone who doesn&#39;t like it, I&#39;m one of the many who doesn&#39;t like it but people are gonna start expecting much and godlike content from YouTube rewind because of the other two were horrible,people are gonna start getting the mentally that everyone is bad because people say it bad but yeh third times the charm,dont mess it up YouTube

Cant wait to dislike the next youtube rewind to keep the trend going

oh hey its mark ass brownie

bro he dont deserve the smoke he aint do anything wrong

The problem is Pewwwwwwwdiiiieeeepieeeeeeeee

Pretty sure it not because of bad that has dislikes, has dislikes because it is meme tho dislike now

The problem with youtuberiwind 2018:It has fortnite but not minecraft

Not this year(2020)

I have never watched YouTube rewind. Why am I watching this.... To the end...

2013 was by far my favorite rewind.

This video has no ads I wonder why? <b>Cough Cough</b>

Mark has brownies

people who subscribe me will live 100 years

Man, how can he be so entertaining and engaging to listen to? despite no background music, no crazy transitions or location change and still manages to catch our attention (like other &quot;content creators do bc they need that to kind of engage). Great work MKBHD. 👍🏼🔥

@willsmith

I think they will just do a zoom meeting with some creators in YouTube rewind 2020 and that&#39;s it

YT the company is a lazy trash heap.

hobo johnson
They should give youtubers  the power &amp; let them make the rewind together,

The most disliked video started with your name being mentioned quite a few times..Lol

maybe yt stopped going to portal a and that&#39;s why this year&#39;s rewind was watchmojo style? and because of the negative connotation w/ yt rewind, they couldn&#39;t get another production company to work on it

YouTube should make YouTube rewind deleted scene

I have hope that this year will be the year they finally bring it back and it will be good for 2020. I need some hope this year.

disliked the rewind after watching this explanation

YouTube: what do you want in the rewind?

People: Pewdiepi-
YouTube: Fortnite? Got it.

Ah the good old days of 2013

I cant believe that someone IN REWIND is saying its bad. -_-

Hi

Markass brownlee

It’s pretty awesome that Will Smith immediately thought of you when asked about YouTubers he watches. I’d be pretty fuckin stoked on that man!

Literally 11 mins of talking...

Sheep: <b>exists</b>Everyone: ah yes, rewind 2018

Hey if I controlled rewind I would want fortnite and mark as brownie

I can never hear the word fortnite without saying &quot;and markass brownlee&quot; now

love the way he doesnt put unessecary links

I think no one even know why they disliked YouTube rewind 2019Watching in future.I THINK.

he didn&#39;t say his name, he said &quot; markass&quot; his brother

unpopular opinion: rewind 2018 wasn&#39;t actually bad

this is now the most disliked video.its now just by youtube.

I have a great idea , they should have differ type of rewinds for everyone, like Rewind 2020 for Tech EnthusiastsOr Rewind for Car Enthusiasts, etc that would be nice I guess

Tim Cook needs to be in youtube rewind.

I just went to jb&#39;baby just to dislike it

rewind 2020 is going to be a blastcoz it can&#39;t get any worser than the year 😒

@NickEh30 at <a href="">7:53</a>

Well, the video has doubled on dislikes

Wow this video recommended me after 1year

<a href="">10:35</a> Why not MrWhosTheBoss?

Next time someone says Tim Cook is obsessed with money, show them this video

Marques was the only good part of Rewind tbh, besides baby shark, of course.

Sorry but, markass brownlee 😂

Youtube Rewind is what corporate Youtube wants their site to be, not what it actually is.

It only a SJW filled movie

I don’t even think 2020 needs a rewind to be honest.

Literally the only people that ever dislike MKHDB’s videos are actually messed up. Lol

2015 was the last best one imo

Markass brownies grown up

Do an unboxing of YT Rewind

I thought this was a tech channel 🤔

It was less what they cut out and not even what they included, what ticked people off was that they felt exactly what you said here: That this video was not made for them but for the advertisers. And that they have felt this for a long time now, that YouTube cares less and less about its viewers and only caters to their advertisers. While understandable, they are after all where the money comes from, it doesn&#39;t exactly sit well with us, the viewers that eventually make those advertisers pay YouTube money.After the AdPocalypse and demonetization of a lot of content providers we liked and whatnot, this Rewind was the proverbial last straw. It wasn&#39;t so much that Rewind 18 was really bad, what caused the reaction it caused was mostly that it was showcasing that YouTube has essentially turned into cable TV: Bland, boring and trying to be as inoffensive as possible because they fear they&#39;d tick off advertisers if they as much as allow anyone to say a bad word.

<a href="">1:35</a> No, YouTube rewind 2010 is the first one

I made fun of you when i first heard marques brownlee, but after seeing your content, not anymore

wait . theres a 2010 rewind

I always wondered why all the channels I watch aren’t on there.

The first one is 2010

Let pewdiepie and russo brothers direct it

you know you have too much sharpness when there&#39;s moire on your skin.

Will Smith knows your name. Cant you appreciate that

even today i still like youtube rewind yes it was hectic but i think some people started hating on it and no one batted an eye and everyone just follow i thought it was much better that people moan about how it was no hate i love your videos

Markass brownie-Will smith

What’s funny is that him and will actually did calab 😂

So this guy is Markass Brownies?

This is the real deal.

I think this year&#39;s YouTube rewind will be emotional.

The last YouTube rewind I&#39;ve seen was 2014. In my opinion, 2012 and 2013 YouTube rewind are the best ones.

Sad

The 24k 👎 are the people that liked rewind

Still cute
If YouTube fixes itself YouTube rewind 2020 will be crazy

Great audio quality
My biggest issue was that it got political and preachy.

It’s funny I don’t recognize half the people in any rewind videos.

No PewDiePie that was why we hated it

It’s become a tradition to dislike YouTube rewind

YouTube Rewind 2011 wasn&#39;t the first rewind. 2010 was.

My iPad is as old as a dinosaur (it&#39;s the original iPad mini) and I was watching a MrWhoesTheBoss video and it randomly decided to go back to the black screen with an apple logo on it

2011 YouTube Rewind = YouTube Rewind 2019

Shdjejsiisi
Mark ass brownlee

everyone wanted pewdiepie. But YouTube didn&#39;t add him. YouTube literally played themselves

M a r k a s s  B r o w n l e e
Ur lucky that will smith called ur name

<b>MARK MY ASS BROWNLY</b>

Why is everyone teasing him with markass brownlee?He is a really nice guy pls dont insult him

markass brownie bitch
The problem with yt rewind is yt rewind

Marques said the first YouTube rewind where it’s basically a watch mojo video was good, and YouTube’s response was to do it again for 2019

Swill mith

PewDiePie: &quot;We are evolving, just backwards&quot;<b>YouTube rewind 2019 basically similar to YouTube rewind 2011</b>Me: Wait a second...😲

Include the most popular Youtubers, look back at the memes and best moments on YouTube, get rid of all the political nonsense, don’t force political views and feminism on us, we get it, but it gets on a lot of people’s nerves.

Markass brownie YouTube didn&#39;t give will smith the right name

YouTube watched this and took him out of 2019 rewind😂

At least you&#39;re honest.Respect

soooo when is part two coming up?

double ads

Yeaaaah  FoRtNiTe and  MaRkAsS bRoWnIe

I haven&#39;t watched a YouTube Rewind since the Gangnam Style one. Sad to heard about the decline

Why is that you r always there in rewind. Have u bribed youtube 😂😂

I’m sorry about the way will smith said your name

youtubers should come together and make their own yt rewinds every year.

literally the only cool things in youtube rewind are Marques and Will Smith. That&#39;s it

I do like Rewind 2018, and still love the &quot;mashup style&quot;, but this video really shows how 2018&#39;s Rewind didn&#39;t really know what it wanted to be - a normal Rewind, or one with a storyline.They try to include more of a storyline with the dialogue, and the &quot;We&#39;re magically creating the Rewind while we&#39;re in it&quot; thing, but as Marques points when he talks about his scene, some of the storyline got edited out - the &quot;story telling&quot; style and the &quot;mash up&quot; style were competing with each other.  Another problem I&#39;ve heard is that the actual references didn&#39;t get much focus - probably because they had to keep going back to the campfire to introduce the next one; had they not done the storyline stuff about creating the Rewind, they could have given the references more focus, and had them all blend into each other or something.It&#39;s a mess at times, but I still like it - the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the talking and the giving things away (as I probably said before), but it still had elements of being a Rewind to me, so it was like a weaker episode of the Rewind series.  2019&#39;s however, disappointed me big time.

Log on my youtube allways

So the first one was a watch mojo too... nice

Dorothy

Yo mark your being an ass. Wanna brownlee?

This was posted on my b day!!!!

<a href="">1:42</a> 2010 was the first one but it was forgettable as fuuuuuuuck

<a href="">9:12</a> wait that is literally Casey

markass brownie

I know I&#39;m over a year late and you probably won&#39;t ever see this but I actually discovered your channel through Youtube Rewind. You and a couple of other tech creators. I never used to watch tech vids and now I love them and this will have been a whole year that I&#39;ve been watching you now. Either way, thanks for being in Youtube rewind that year.

Its been 2 years from the Youtube Rewind 2018 and I&#39;m still laughing at FORTNIGHT and MARK ASS BROWNIE

Not even Mark Ass Brownie liked YouTube Rewind 2018
So your markass brownie, the guy who will Smith likes as much as fortnite

you have no other option?
1 year later......

Mark ass brownlee

Why are everyone mocking his name?

Mark Ass Brown Lee 😂😂

Who is here after he predicted 2019&#39;s rewind?

Wow looks like a trash just dance

So I&#39;ve been using YouTube for a while now.

Imagine watching a video that lasts <a href="">11:11</a> and your watching it at 11:11pm

Who else recognize that the thumbnail markass made was actually based on one of elon musk&#39;s most popular images ???? That face he made was spot on he must flick the beans to Elon or something.

If I control rewind I would want fortnite and markass brownleeMarkass brownlee???

Who is here after MKBHD reviled his K-name

I would want  FoRtNite and Markass brownie

We need the 2019 version

who want u mark fucking ass

The comments bellow so funny

He&#39;s right! The whole time my leg was shaking cause I was uncomfortable with how fast-paced it was. I feel like I was missing everything so I had to rewatch several times.

YouTube got so much hate in 2018 they just stopped trying in 2019

Here after the 2019 Rewind. They did the (sort of) right thing - a top of the best videos. BUT! They also did mash everything together with quick cuts and lots of songs. I think the whole Rewind thing is now so stained that it cannot be &#39;good&#39; again. The viewers will press the dislike simply because it is the Rewind thing.

IDK why this was in my recommended, its like for 2018 YTR and its 2019, when i first saw this i thought that he was going to talk about YTR 2019, its funny, idk i just had to say it

I have no problem with mark ass brown lips, but i hate him to my guts when i see him on yt rewind 2018. hes like represent some decent youtuber that gone bad.

Markass Brownlee: <a href="">10:18</a>Youtube Rewind 2019: <a href="">8:44</a>

Why is this recommended to me now...

I know you because of the YouTube rewind 2018! At least something good come from it right?

Congratulations in advance for 10M follower!!!

Little did he know youtube rewind 2019 would be a rewind back to youtube rewind 2011

the whole opening premise was wrong. The most dislike is Rewind 2018 by 7M over JB&#39;s measily 10M

I thought he said “mark ass Browne”

I am  there after YouTube rewind 2019Nothing has changhed

now 2019 rewind just went back to a top 10 list

They should’ve included the KSi was Logan Paul fight in my opinion

YYYYYAAAAAA ITS REWIND TIME

Guess what he is not featured in 2019 lol...

Fati bom bom
So youtube recommend a video about their problems.

Thanks markass

Markass brownlee

Markass Brownlee

The problem with YouTube Rewind 2019

So basically, in short, its all just for money.

The 2019 rewind is just 2011 but worse

YouTube just needs to grow a pair.

MARKASS BROWNIE

They did a hard reset this year

It didnt get any better

Is this what you wanted?

wait, you&#39;re Markass Brownies?

Anyone here after 2019 YouTube rewind

YouTube: &quot;So in 2019, let&#39;s see what you like&quot;Everyone: &quot;we like to copy and paste other people&#39;s comments&quot;

Rewind 2019 is just a rewind of YT rewind and it close the deceny like it has begun: with a top 10 video

The problem was that you was in it

He said this and he isn’t in YouTube rewind 2019 lol

fortnite and marques brownlee

Alyson Stoner&#39;s rewind is definitely the real one we all needed.

Why everyone in the comments wanna insult this dude&#39;s name like what did he do to you mate

Just watched rewind 2018,😅Damn, I was disappointed!

just a reminder : rewind 2019 is coming in just few weeks

No one:Will Smith:I want <b>fOrTnIte and MARK ASS BROWNIE</b>

Shouldn’t we be asking what <b>isn’t</b> wrong with YouTube Rewind?

This is how many problems there are with You Tube:  <b>[insert list below]</b>

I have been watching you for such a long time and I only realised now you are MARK ASS BROWNIE

Well I&#39;m here a week before the new one

who&#39;s here waiting for rewind 2019 just to drop a dislike again

Drop a like if ur here after 2020 rewind

M A R K A S S B R O W N I E  E E
For 2019 YouTube rewind, youtubers should come together to make the people’s YouTube rewind

Why the f*ck is Liza the host of every rewind since 2017

I want FOrtnite and marques brownlee

oh look its Markass brownie

Watching that markass brownlee again

ive never seen david dobrik in the yt rewind yt is being rude dont you agree markass brownlee

Unpopular opinion: I feel bad for the producers and creators of rewind last year, and as this one aproaches I hope the community can be a bit more forgiving, effort still goes into this and it may not be what we want, but there are a few people who actually decided what happens.

M    A    R   K    A    S    S    S

Hmmm....YouTube.....well really Google....no wait....its really &quot;Alphabet Inc&quot;. Guess corporate has finally made their way into EVERY aspect of Content Creation.....I guess I&#39;ll start going through my subscriptions and UN-subscribe from the ones who have been &quot;tamed&quot; by guys in suits!

I thought they signed a contract to not speak about it oof(And the rewind was indeed a failure)

You are the problem

I am just waiting for the new one....

Almost 12 months have passed.. It&#39;s <b>almost</b> Rewind Time again, lads!

finally I found the original Mark Ass Brownie guy!

If MrBeast not included in this year rewind people be raiding youtube rather than area 51

Markass Brownie

I 100% agree

the funny thing is that rewind 2019 is worse then rewind 2018

Markass brownie

Hey its the MARKASS BROWNLEE GUY!!EDIT: Now that you think about it, it is kind of true. Well, now I feel bad that markass might not be in the rewind 2019 because he splashed the truth out and I will miss pewds spelling out &#39;markass&#39; while reacting to 2019 rewind.

also, its the fact that youtube is being terrible to other youtubers lolol. Like to Markiplier, (i came here cuz of him) Almost all his live-stream viewers lost their youtube AND google accounts because youtube banned them for no apparent reason. (sure, maybe 6 comments in the span of 2 hours) and Youtube says they are unable to fix it when they&#39;re just lazy and can&#39;t be bothered. OH, and a major thing is the fact that PewDiePie wasn&#39;t on rewind when he was such a big thing in 2018 xD

Pewdiepie vs Tseries, arguably the biggest event to ever happen on YouTube, was just swept under the rug, and that’s what annoyed the shit out of me

so      the       shootings     begin      again

Rewind 2017 is the best from my perspective

I would want... fortni-

well there are no pewdiepie and T-series and pubg

Lets fuck portal-A and let creators make rewind 2019

Maria’s brownlee
I would love to meet MarkAss Brownie.

Weezer - Pork And Beans was the first Youtube Rewind.

Marques Brownlee-the guy Will Smith wanted in Youtube Rewind 2018

For the 2021 rewindn, for the 10 year anniversary.Instead of Rebacca Black doing the 10 most viewed videos of the year it should pewdiepie doing the ten most viewed videos by CREATORS from 2011-2021 in meme review or lwiay style.

markASS BROWNIE

It needs to be like a 4 part or 2 part vids

We need more memes and less U.S. political agendas. Who watches rewind for political reasons? And Will Smith doesn&#39;t care about YouTube. Give us PewDiePie or Elon Musk

Yeah but, where the fortnite?

The problem was that there was no pewdiepie,Mr.Beast,T-series, and a few other people

Here when it was 6.9 million views

to me the major thing was how forced the newer rewinds come across, its hard to watch, like a kids friendly corporate lifeless commercial, covering up its fakeness with a mind boggling amount of cuts, colors and names. its like most of the youtubers are getting rid of their own unique style and directed to be someone they simply arent.acting is tough as fuck, so with youtubers who are for the most part used to being themselves, they should just be themselves and allow them to take part in the scripting process.

hello, this is markass Brownie?

I cant wait for the Pewdiepie YT Rewind 2019

Next one is release in a month.<del>hope it isn’t shit</del>it will be shit

Marques Brownlee just said the truth

stop telling me things i already know!!!

I feel as though the will smith thing would have been so much cooler this year given will smith was genie this year

2016 was the best

The problem with YouTube Rewind:The dislikes is too low.

So your that Markass Brownie guyIght imma head out

2019 i ma head in this time

The problem with youtube rewindYoutube rewind 2018

How did this get any dislikes, must of been all of YouTube’s bots

Mark ass brownlee

MARKASS BROWNIE!

They should not of put fortnight in the rewind

What were your favorite moments or moments that you think should have been left out of last year? What do you think should be included in THIS year...?

Ah Shitt!! rewind is coming again

When will smith said you’re name i I thought he said Markass brownie

If I could control rewind I would want...

The first time I ever heard about you was on YT rewind 2018 and, gotta admit, I started avoiding your videos when they showed up on my recommendations (I watch A LOT of tech videos). But then I had your &quot;BTS with Lew&quot; video in front of me and couldn&#39;t help myself (gotta love Lew). Dude, I totally regretted avoiding your channel. Instant subscription. I&#39;ve seen dozens of your videos ever since. You&#39;re one of the best tech youtubers over here.

Markass Brownlee

I found you because of Youtube Rewind and have started watching all of your videos + JerryRigEverything. Love you guys, but kinda disappointed it came from YT rewind lol.

We’ve come to the conclusion : Youtube Rewind sucks.

Everything

<a href="">2:53</a> <b>Super clean creators</b>Ninja: <b>&quot;The f@ck you say to me you little sh!t??&quot;</b>

Who wants pewdepie and Mr Beast in rewind 2020👇

Markass Brownie, man please

(I&#39;m a little late to this but) You definitely made some good points. However, 2018&#39;s youtube rewind (the worst one) also has a lot to do with representing the best of the worst and the worst of the best. Fortnite, kpop, all of the represented things weren&#39;t respectively paired with its fanbase/audience, making it seem forced and not original in the slightest. They mention in the rewind that it&#39;s time for them to represent what THEY like and how they want to see it played out, but instead acted as pawns to the biggest influences in the year and weren&#39;t able to showcase what they personally were able to accomplish and influence themselves. I&#39;m not saying the creators don&#39;t appreciate fortnite, kpop, etc. but instead youtube should have put in their respective fanbases. To fortnite, a community of gamers dancing, to kpop, Korean&#39;s dancing with a huge audience in the background (in a sense it is appreciating by placing the creators in kpop but like again, they aren&#39;t the ones who represent kpop and its influence in anyway at all.) The animators, (a little before the middle of the video) were represented properly, with all of them collaborating to a song in their own styles. The worst however starts at the middle of the video. It&#39;s one thing to talk about the greats and accomplishments of the year, but it&#39;s another when you try to push your political agenda into something meant to be creative and awesome. Most of what they were saying came off as indirectly shaming people who didn&#39;t side with them when they mentioned, stuff like mental illness, women empowerment, Asian representation, working single moms, and etc. It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t people who respect and acknowledge it, but  everyone has their own EQUALLY meaningful opinions about views on society especially when it comes to the political spectrum of things. It was unnecessary and really destroyed the vibe of the video. But after that segment toward the last few minutes, what youtube rewind SHOULD have been from the start actually showcases all the great things that made the year fun, (of course with the exception of creators taking the spot of highlights that didn&#39;t represent them at all.)I hope they can fix their wrongs and give 2019 a good Youtube rewind. A one where creators and the top trending things of this year are met with their respective fanbase/audience. Also, I do hope to see Pewdiepie in there as well. After getting married and hitting the 100 million subcount as an individual creator, there is no possible way not to congratulate it.

I want fork knife and markass brownie

The problem is that there is no pewd (for short)

Wonder how 2019 rewind will be?

Yt before 2016 : fun entertaining and awesome Yt post 2016 : authoritarian, divided and not fun

Markass brownlee

Barques Mrownlee

Hey did you guys see that MarKaz brownie comment?

Why the hell Youtube would take TWITCH BIGGEST FORNITE STAR NINJA in ther annual rewind he is not even a youtuber he use the platform to promote his stream videos on TWITCH

It&#39;s funny he called will Smith not that big of a YouTuber and now he just interviewed him😂

<a href="">6:31</a> It annoys me so much that that was filmed a Harrow, literally the library at my school.

Wow just watching this for kicks, went on your page and you actually did collab with Will Smith lol

Happy 6.9 million views

markASSSSSSS BROOOOOWNLEEEEEEEEWWW

Heh 😏 this video is currently at 6.9 million views Like if you are one of these 6.9 million viewers.

I’m late, let me make a jokeMarkass Brownie

Aah that&#39;s hot.

They better include Minecraft in 19&#39;s rewind

Am I the only one who noticed that the video is exactly <a href="">11:11</a> long

Coming back a bit later, I still feel as though I disagree slightly. A point you made was that each rewind has had the bad habit of attempting to fit too much in such little time. Your suggested solution was to simply remove or certain events or content. However I firmly believe that retaining the events important to each portion of YouTube supported by different communities is almost quintessential. YouTube in 2012 was much smaller and contained a more isolated community with similar interests. However, as the platform genuinely evolved, it became a multitude of communities as opposed to the idea that YouTube was simply one community. My suggested solution is produce the video in a manner where each scene has it&#39;s own meaning and a interleaved relation to each community. In other words, allow the video to be longer. I&#39;m sure I would even prefer that to the short montage style.

Markass brownie?

Brownie ?
Stop the Mark ass brownieGive the boy respect+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sorry, no, it never TURNED INTO an ad for YouTube - that is what it always was.  Perhaps the content is a little different now, but really - let&#39;s not put on those flowery glasses.

Glad I&#39;m not the only one who noticed dat black ass.... I&#39;m talking about Rebecca Black of course...Gee, who were you thinking about, you racist? ಠωಠ

I want portnight and Markass Brownies .

<a href="">2:21</a> What&#39;s that on the right?

<a href="">3:58</a>

Hello everyone it&#39;s MarkAss Brownlee
The whole thing was a circle jerk for asia.

Honestly YouTube rewind is dumb... it isn&#39;t like its motivating people to be with the community... its like just watching a music video mashup...

I meet you by the rewind, and (true) I searched &quot;Markass&quot;, now I love your content, saludos de México.

I still watch this and laugh how people say you cant please everyone.........simple add pewdiepie and problem is solved.

Sorry for the cliché commentHey mom?Yeah?What’s for dessert?I baked a batch of Mark ass brownies if you want.Ok but can I have some fortnite with it?Ok son

PewDiePie didn’t deserve to be in rewind since he’s an arrogant racist prick. But I do agree with you that YTR has changed from the fun simple video it used to be.

MARK ASS BROWN LEE

BASICALLY K-POP

Rewind 2016 was actually good

Whats good mark ass brownie

They also forgot the Uganda Knuckles Meme and the who touch my spaghetti

FORKNIGHT AND MARKASS BROWNIES

Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t know who Marques Brownlee was but I&#39;ve been watching all of his (your) content the whole past year without even knowing it.

I just noticed, I heard your name Marques Brownlee somewhere in YouTube rewind 2018 and I just noticed that you were in it.I subbed for the tech reasons though, that&#39;s why I&#39;m still subbed to you.Didn&#39;t figure this out now until like almost a year later XD

youtube rewind is ironically what got me into mkbhd

I would windForTniTe n MarKass BroWnie✌🏿

MarkASS Brownie

89% <b>MARKASS BROWNIE</b>16% others2.1% percents

The only problem was to put youtubers that nobody knew and not highlight the best moments of the year, since everything was fortnite.And they were making content for children.Literally, all the people we saw rewind were older

Youtube: you&#39;ve already watched this but I&#39;ll recommend it again.Me: watches it.

Why am I the only one that likes 2018 rewind

I&#39;m watching this in September and I&#39;m just waiting for the next YT rewind and dang this year&#39;s rewind better be good

What can YT do to make it better next year?....well, simple.. bring back Pewdiepie.

A lot of words to say basically nothing. Boring. Like your other content.

Hey mkbhd, make the 2019 rewind...

YouTube rewind 2018, “Let’s read the comments..” FORTNITE AND MARK ASS BROWNLEE

They need give up on advertising. The contraveries such as ksi vs logan they get the publicity. Surely that kinda video would attract advertisers?

Markass Brownie

Yaaaaa that&#39;s hot that&#39;s hot

MARKASS BROWNIE

Markass Brownie

Marques, yo&#39;re great at explaining what went wrong with youtubes monstrosity of a Rewind. When I first watched YR 2018 I had a hard time understanding what Will Smith was sayin&#39;. (To be fair, I had never heard your name before because I watch Linus Tec Tips instead when it comes Tec-Vids..)But I was 18 sec in and wonder: What the F is an &quot;Mark Ass Brownie&quot;?!?!Will: Articulate!!! Avoid words like ASS and BROWNIE

Ok,but who&#39;s Marques Brownlee?

id pay a rewind if every creator would make an ironic video by dressing up as pewdiepie and shouting pewdiepie for 10 minutes and 1 second. also put irony kpop idk

If pewdiepie getting married,beating the ender dragon, and getting to 100M and it’s not rewind there will be problems.

It&#39;s crazy I didn&#39;t know MKBHD until watching rewind and now he&#39;s one of my Fav tech youtubers 😂😂

Miss nexgen frizz videos :(
Yhahahahaaaaa that&#39;s hot!

So marques won&#39;t be in youtube rewind 2019?😭

Mark-ass-brownie

Oh dats hot, dats hot

The most liked YouTuber Pewdiepie.. YouTube: Ima stop u right there

Poor Markass Brownlee.
Youtube asks markass for 2019 rewind Markass brownlee:infinity yeet confermed

Now it has double the dislikes

Will smith was wrong

2019 rewind will have minecraft again

Dude I didn&#39;t know who you were and I was watching your videos before this one. Now I know your in YouTube rewind lol

It should of just been T-Series ,PewDiePie, PewDiePie’s chair , Minecraft ,The end of Fortnite , Brad1 ,Brad2, Shane Dawson and Apple Memes

Unoriginal comment alert:MarkAss Brownies

He spoke truth.Thats why he got no ad in this video.Gg yt.

YouTube rewind is just an ego boost for youtubers

markass brownie

Well you’re not getting invited to the next one. But honestly who tf wants to be?

pewdiepie reacting to youtube rewind: mark ass brown??? wait...

Of course they demonitized

This is sadIt was my first YouTube rewind I have ever watch EVER😢

Regret it sorry im late

Markass brownlee REWINDED:BROWNASS MARKLEE

this dude !
Now I know who Markass Brownie is

Hey MARKASS BROWNLEE

Gaytnite you know

I think if they showed 1sec of PewDiePie clip in yt 2018 rewind they could have saved it from dislikes

Markles bramli
Oh I thought your name was Mark S. Brownlee

It&#39;s because no actually YouTubers people know I knew like three people and 1 of them was a (ex twitch now mixer streamer that&#39;s right not even to do with YouTube)

why is there a black tech youtuberMARKASS BROWNI-E

mArkASS BrOwnLEEroooooooooooooy Jenkinsss!!!!!
I need D&amp;P, PewDiePie, Markiplier, and JackSepticEye in Rewind 2019. Then I’ll be satisfied LMAO

the first youtube rewind is the 2010 rewind

<a href="">11:11</a>make a wish!

Quiet Markass
Markass brownie

if pepsi man isnt in youtube rewind 2019 then ima go drink axe bodywash

The sad thing for youtube rewind 2019 is that they will use minecraft in some nasty way, and also they will probably say something about t-series passing pewdiepie

For him he doesnt mind being cut out itself shows how humble marques is.

I like how he’s not defending youtube at all and that’s good Btw M A R K A S S   B R O W N I E E

Youtube, the platform not the content creators of youtube, cannot make people happy anymore. The golden era of youtube has passed, and now they are filled with this greed that they can&#39;t contain.

I bet he won’t be asked to be in 2019

Mark ass brownie

The problem is because u r now markass brownlee

Forknite and mark ass brownie

This guys looks like Markass brownie.

Your a terrible actor btw.

It seems that your channel name is misspelled, it’s supposed to be <b>MARKASS BROWNIE</b>

It&#39;s just sad on how I been on YouTube for 3 years with no fame... Plus, my nephew deleted almost all my videos so don&#39;t use that lame excuse. So if you want to support me, plz subscribe, just do it, please... Also YouTube treats me like shit and keeps recommending random drama I didn&#39;t watch nor want to watch. So YouTube, fuck you, and your company and maybe add me in your rewind, maybe I&#39;ll make it better 😡🖕 fuck YouTube. I&#39;ll stop saying this if you stop treating me like shit!

SOOOOO FUCKING TRUE

This video has no views.. hmm I wonder why..

Can I get uhhha <b>F O R T N I T E</b>and uhh... a<b>M A R K A S S  B R O W N I E</b> ?

So basically you are telling us how you suffered in the making of youtube rewind 2018?

Man those videos are cringe as fuck. Rewind IMO should be kind of showing who blew up on youtube for the year with what video, I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t show any of the big guys but I think it&#39;s really cool seeing people who have been at it for years and now finally are seeing some progress with their channels, why not embrace that and show them in a rewind as well.

Markass Brownshit

If I could control rewind this year I would want, Fortnite and Markass Brownlee

Why am i watching it in the middle of 2019?

OMG they made Mark ass brownie from the yt-rewind into a real person.Lmao

I gave it a thumbs up because he said the line :)

Mmmm i really want some mArKaSs BrOwNiE

now all we need need is fortnite

well said👐

XXXTENTACION&#39;s death was kinda big, caused a lot of people to become depressed and/or suicidal. Yet youtube said fuck it and didnt include that

All the comments about <b>&quot;Markass Browniee&quot;</b> made me laugh so hard

I personally thought 2016 and even kinda sorta 2017 were pretty good. 2018, total sellout. Catering to the big companies and liberal PC fucktards. Don&#39;t like what I just said? You probably are one. They said we control rewind. They lied. They made it the exact you opposite. Sellouts.

leave some stuff out? how about actually LISTENING to what the people want to see n not advertising for money

If YouTube wants to improve Rewind,They should hire Pewdiepie

All rewind is now, YouTube circle jerk with its Left hand.

PREACH

It’s called rewind because  that’s what happened to the quality

Fuck ass brownie

Mark Ass Brownie

Discovered Mark-ass via Will Smith. Very good video to explain all this.

Lol he cant even spell his own name, its clearly Markass Brownee

<b>IS THIS WHAT U WANTED?</b>

Ahh, the good Markass brownee

We want pewdiepie

The biggest problem for u is that Will Smith called you mark-ass brownlee

FORTNITE

Who else thought his name was Mark Ass Brownie

Markass Brownie

Gordon Ramsay in youtube rewind2019

youtube rewind 2018 must have a billion dislike in the year 2020 or 2050 or some year

Oh isn&#39;t this MARKASS BROWNIE

<b>M A R K A S S  B R O W N I E</b>
Why he’s making a video on the shittiest video on YouTube if he made an appearance on it and it does not make sense???

pewdiepies not in it thats why

There is only 3 reasons1: it&#39;s cringe2: no pewds ;(3:mark ass brownie

Mahc arse brownie

PewDiePie !! You can’t make rewind without adding the God of YouTube. He may not be the most subscribed anymore but he is the most subscribed REAL YouTuber/content creator.

Markass Brownie

VULFPECK

markASS brownlee

you should watch the &quot;google year in Review&quot; or &quot;Yahoo year in ReView&quot; both of them are WAY better then YouTube Rewind

You don’t Deserve to be in the Worst Rewind

I cant help it bro your barber needs to be fired

MARKASS BROWNIE: this year&#39;s rewind&#39;s like YouTube calling advertisers &quot;hey,these are people who are good for paying to show adsMe:he is in the video

Yaaaahh

2016 bad2017 also bad2018 somehow manages to be worse

I got super triggered at <a href="">8:29</a>

Didn&#39;t care for the barrage of leftists politics and the kumbaya circle time around the campfire.

My bad, it&#39;s not 26M dislikes yet, but 16M atm.

The content is from Twitter, twitch, news, Netflix, kpop, BUT NOT ENOUGH YT!

I hate YouTube ads!! Keep them out of the rewind!

Um, Rewind 2018 is at 26M dislikes now.

He said &quot;leave me out next year&quot;I like this brownie

Anyone here after it has taken down the throne from Baby?

I think YouTube should promote up and coming channels and actually give them a chance instead of just promoting big ones who are already established and traditional news media

Cuz FARTNITE

Markass Brownie

Yaaaaa it’s rewind time

Mark ass brownie

I Loved the chaos, bring on the chaos! This year was not chaotic, it was sad.

the thing is just put a real youtuber

Biggest creators? What about PewDiePie?

All the comments MUST HAVE THE LETTERS m, a and r.

i was surprised this video didn&#39;t got taken down due to inappropriate content for youtube

The reason small creators are

Now I’m suddenly craving some <b>m a r k a s s b r o w n i e s</b>

FortNite and this guy

I wonder how YouTube rewind 2019 will be

Fortnite and markass brownie

DwaahaaFortniteMARKASS Brownlee

Why the hell is everyone hearing Markass Brownie while I hear Marques Brownlee?

you could have just made a 1 second video saying. “Everything”(Based on the title)

Maybe they should stop pushing liberal agendas down everyone’s throats?

U gay

Thanks so much for explaining actually! I was completely lost when I watched that rewind, I didn&#39;t understand what the hell the flying bus was all about (I heard that Fortnite was a game but obviously never played it) and it just was totally lost on me. And you&#39;re right, everything was happening so fast that it never ended up making much sense.

MarkAss Brownie😂😂

Stars in YTRewind 2018Makes a rant about why it was cringeSeems legit.

Did youtube pay these youtubers to be in the video?

I heard people were actually liking Baby to bump rewind down even further.

ha unbox therapy has 14 million subs

Markass Brownlee

One of the things that ruined it was too much fortnite. Everytime I saw fortnite I wanted to die. For real.

I&#39;m late,so I can&#39;t say a meme about Mark ass Brownie.

I saw you on the empire team

you need a haircut

Dont agree completely? I mean if its for advertiser, what the hell is Ninja doing there?

Want it fixed, let Casey edit it... like his &quot;do what you can&#39;t&quot; video.

Markass Brownie

wearing black and having black in the background doesn’t suit you. this vid is so dim i had to turn up my screen brightness to maximum 🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆
