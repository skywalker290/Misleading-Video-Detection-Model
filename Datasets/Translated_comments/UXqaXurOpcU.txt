where is hakla srk for ram jane, duplicate, koyla and many more such movies?

No can beat legend of over acting varun dhawan ❤❤❤❤

Its incredible Jammuy!That you actually sit through and watch these gems.

There are many SRK movies in early 90s even anjaam and darr was overacting

In which plane has the signal arrived??
to. Planeee........crashh💥 <a href="">4:49</a>
Nice video

Looks TRP has disappointed this around. Surely, there are more instances of over acting. May be you couldn&#39;t get rights to those scenes. Who can forget gems like: Arjun Pandit and Gunda. These 2 movies alone boast of many scenes which can easily top those shown in this video by a country mile. I think you have had these movies in some of your lists earlier. But surely, you weren&#39;t able to watch these movies patiently enough to uncover those scenes :D!

Bruh !! Where them clowns Krk and Sonu Nigam at !? Their acting  could make a sober person tweek like they be on Molly

I felt worried about Rekha when he said PARkash (not PRAkash) , I love Rekha 😂😂😂

😂😂 aur Plane crash !! Lekin ye kaunsa airlines hai jisme hawa me Network rehta hai jo dev and anand ne apne wife se Baat ki 🙏🤪😝😝

My life has lasted only 5 minutes..I have been drinking..I have been drinking..I am drinking.
where is legendary KRK of Desh drohi

Thank God being an Cinemaholic I&#39;m not a part of audience of these movies,I think if i may could watch MASTER then my whole life will went in scratching walls 😂

Rajesh Khanna and dev anand two great example of why you should take step down when you past your prime and not desperately try to proof you can still act.

Dev An and was not an actor at all

Why don&#39;t you make this on South Indian movies?

I&#39;m sorry Anmol, but you fart&#39;s timing was really off 😂😂😂

After watching @<a href="">5:50</a> ..bhai mai tere muh par paana phekna chata hun....to tighten his brain bolts..hilarious acting! Wonder how a good actor like Rakesh Bedi kept a straight face through this travesty.

How can you miss the epic manoj kumar&#39;s clerk..

Wrong : Dev Anand was past his prime after 1971 Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Movies he made and acted after that were all crap. Rajesh Khanna was past his prime after Big B&#39;s zanjeer in 1973.

Aur aur...plane crash 🤣 lol
Stop butchering my name
Was the last guy from start plus Mahabharata (bheem)????

That plane craassshhh...😃😃😃😄😄

This is a tradition, isn't it?
Time before covid.GOLD

That plane crash line omg what was that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Most of the Bollywood actors except some of the stage background actors like Paresh Rawal, Naseeruddin shah, om puri, Irfan khan, Amrish puri, Nawasuddin siddiqui etc don’t have any kinds of acting skills. All are either with good looks or with family background survives in films.

Plane Craaaaaaash
🔧 I want 🔧
i love rekha 😂😂😂 may it be damn
Rakesh bedi is a gem of a actor

Fardeen acting was ok 👍

Fardeen was not as bas as Hrithik in MPKDH

oh god.... i am thinking why did I subscribe to this!!!!!

Where are you looking for brother?
My friend you forgot the movie deshdrohi😅😅😅

Surprised to see no  mention of Zayed Khan here.

Y don&#39;t u review bollywood movies without a biased view

I am crazy about love = I am crazy about overacting 🤣🤣 Hugging and making Hrithik Roshan pregnant 🤣🤣
Hey you forgot Modi ji.
Comantery is so boring

where is selmon bhoi??

Hero: What can I do to Parkash? What can I do to you? Parkash: You are acting 🤣
All I can say is they have acted better than Katrina, Jacqueline, Varun Dhawan. All bachkana acting

Exposes ..How  fools  are bollywood  buggs..  they r  overhyped   unnecessarly..

Worst commentary

These were not overacting but horrible acting.

The first one is not overacting but it was underacting.

Anu

Hrithik Roshan in main prem ki deewani hoon....yikesss!! So embarrassing to watch!

Please remove the  picture from Anand movie from the thumbnail it is just masterpiece

the last guy bunty looks more like a villain or comedian

Dude, where do you find the patience to see and tolerate all this ?!!!!

Where is Prem Aggan 🤣🤣
Is your name jammy 🥰🥰🥰
Not bol bhai
Mummy is no longer sweet darling lolz this is a very hilarious scene because legend has spoken like this
<a href="">4:28</a> what the hell was that and the girl&#39;s reaction 😂😂

I see brother &quot;Wafa&quot;
That Anand&#39;s son 😂😂😂😂

Hahaha... Those farts. 😷 With all due respect to his stardom, Rajesh Khanna was a bad actor. I liked him only in Anand. Baki sab bakwas.

To whom has it been given... To whom has it been given in such a way
The dubbing  of that Hong Kong officer 😂😂😂😂😂

Oh no you forgot Varun dhawan in inception
Lol the FART SCENE was too good!!!!

Scream and............................(.plane crash)
You were wrong mere bhai when you said that the talentless exuse for an actor Suneil Anand didn&#39;t follow in his father&#39;s footsteps... when it came to cringey and pathetic acting, he definitely DID. Dev Anand was past his prime many years ago and he should have retired but was determined to make those third rate &quot;comedies&quot;, how anyone can call that art, I will never know. It&#39;s interesting how Indian Cinema&#39;s veterans who were so good in their heyday sadly lose the plot in their later years... Dev Anand, Rajesh Khanna, Manoj Kumar ( after the classic KRANTI never was able to gain any critical or financial success in anymore of his directorial ventures ), Feroz Khan was electric to watch even towards the end of his life, but his directing talents (especially involving his shit son) were forgettable to say the least. It&#39;s about time these talentless sons and daughters of older actors actually got themselves proper jobs instead of torturing the cinema going public.

Please Fardeen Khan&#39;s acting was perfect.

Jaanashee does not deserve this list, rest is fine.

Nice now I need jhandu pancharist to digest this cringe

Good video 👌....but I really got lost in your mesmerizing voice.... accent...and great comand over English language 👍

Hilarious .... When u said rajesh khanna covering his face every 10 sec as if laila Khan is farting with her every dialogue delivery

Rajesh khanna might be suppresseing his laugh

Why have you added sub titles? Very annoying

SUNIEL ANAND HAHAHAHA 😂

Sunil anand looks like Dev anand&#39;s brother rather than his son😄Anyone else agrees with me???

Bhai tu bohat hi &quot;mummy daddy&quot; hai way. Josh….Ay….Jawaani
First one was hilariously funny

Mummy nai rahin sweety darling 🤣🤣
The farting part🤣🙌🏻

Seeing all this 💩must be painful

Bhai 90 percent of them are faltu actors scripts thieves. All about family members promote their good for nothing kids in balls wood, politics, businesses...Dhavan, hritik,sridivi kids, dharmendra kids, bacchan kids, bhatt kids, padukone bitch and prianka overacting ki dukaan, Salman bhaijaan jabardasti acting, Akshay goomaar, mimics Keanu reeves fails miserably almost looks like a hijda walking, pappu maino ghandi, bianca ghandi, reliance kids, all hyped, overrated. Mediocre... I never watch all this thrash, but will tell all you who watch them. Buy pirated for not more than rs 30. Inki aasli aukaad ye hi hai. Chappal chor chutiyas

What who gets network while on a moving...... plane?

How does he possibly watch these films is what comes as a shock to me .

Legend 😂😂😂<a href="">4:28</a>
kitna research karke banata he video wah bhai wah

<a href="">

I love Rekha 😂😂😂
Rajesh Khanna&#39;s was the best, actress farting 🤣🤣🤣🤣

devanand&#39;s all movies are over acted so as raj kumar&#39;s and shatrughan sinha and many more&#39;s ••• as per your opinion,i think .

Rip Lela khan
Senior actors are not done as expected means may be directors asking for more takes . Directors fault .

Shame you India. Fuck

Make video on same actors  who had one small role to play but nailed it. Just like that women in singham  returns that woman who played  the role of that kids mother who took money from the politician to give him vote

One episode should be dedicated to launch of the kids (flop) by their veteran parents. Karan deol, fardeen khan etc

Hahaaaaaaaa

Sweety darling 😂😂😂😂😂😂Parkaash 😅😅😅😅😅

Plane crash....!!!!!!!?😅😅😅😅😅
At <a href="">4:45</a> Devanand was talking to her wife when she was in the air, technology of 80&#39;s was quite advance no?

It feels really bad to see a legend like Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand doing such work

<a href="">5:47</a> If someone works in the garage then please do it with a pen
Where is himalay

Sir I don’t see any wrong on any of them it’s all over the director who need to shape the screen . It’s his idea how to make natural projection of drama. Actors just follow what they are told to do. That’s all. Specially Dev shaab how is supposed to act on such a tragedy scene. How will another actor react on That situation. They all do same or even worse. So directions is responsible for all of these.  ! If I’m wrong correct me. ! 😊

1. Shahrukh khan - Ram Jane,  Duplicate, Guddu etc2. Ranvir Singh - Simba3. Varun dhawan- Dishoom, Judwa4. Aamir Khan- Mela,  Thugs of Hindostan5. Salman Khan- Hello Brother6. Kareena kapoor - Mai Prem Ki deewane hoom, khushi7. Amitabh Bacchan - RGV ki aag8. Akshay Kumar - singh is bling, Teesmaarkhan9. Saif - humshakals Please tell me if you agree..

Mela starring twinkle was ott...just thinking of some scenes makes me cringe😂😖And ofc main prem ki diwani hoon was just🤢🤢🤢Kareena as pooh in kabhi khushi kabhi gam in the intro part was well something i never wanna see or hear ever again!

That  &#39;candid&#39; pic at the end..😂

<a href=""> is funniest scene I hv seen ever.

please make a video on Rang de Basanti and Gulaal

Wtf... ye do(rajesh Khanna &amp; dev aanand) kahake legends the bc aveyi apne baap logone bada bata dia inko acting to aati ni😂

Fardin scene was just ok...

I&#39;ve seen very little Bollywood movies but much much more overacting scenes than these ones. Am speechless wondering how they&#39;re picked 😳!. Obviously very lazy-ly.

Funny video but narrator&#39;s Indian accent English is even funnier its hilarious indian accent English 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is Himesh Reshamiya’s ....Karzz

Omg farting sound covering face rajesh khanna is so hilarious I watched it again &amp; again 😂😂😂

Please search for &quot;khooni raat&quot; on YouTube, it beats everything hands down. Especially the dance sequence.

Mummy Nahi Rahi Sweety Darling
Hey english fucker
Fardeen Khan&#39;s scene shouldn&#39;t be added

Kareena kapoor in Mea prem ki diwani hun, kareena in khushi movie

Omg lol

Brilliant collection. Makes you wonder how some even made it to the stardom status ☺️☺️☺️

Brother, these are the same things that happen in the movies.. Manna Padega.
fardeen khan and the last guy, bunty or whoever, not too bad. in the video shown at least. and in relative context to much worse acting in Bollywood movies, even by top stars. love in Times Square has some hilarious scenes especially the one with dev anand and others reacting to seeing planes crashing into twin towers.

Hi buddy I watched your videos couple of times it’s fantastic I have some hilarious encounters too watching movies i want to share with you Let me know your mail id

Fardeen Khan to galat daal dia isme 🙏🙏

U talk a lot n movie clips are of less duration.

Which is why outsiders like Ram Gopal Varma and all of his batch like Sri Ram Raghavan and Shimit Amin, others like Priya Darshan got succeeded :)

Farts were the best....😂😆🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
When the actor said Prakash mein kya karu? I almost screamed- acting chor de!😄

Kareena in khushi

Should see dev anand&#39;s censor ...

Hindi m backchodi kr le yar
Overacting's dad Shaib Phalke = Neha Kakkar IIfa = Neha Kakkar Gima = Neha Kakkar's sister Oscar = Sonu Kakkar's sister
Shit! Bullshit! Chahe woh pyaar ho ya sad scenes, koi bhi actors/actress aisa apna jazbaat ka izhaar itna dramatically karta hai kya! I feel really sorry for legendary actors like Dev Anand &amp; Rajesh Khanna for such a spoilspot! They didn&#39;t deserve to be in this shitty bollywood films!

Where Salman all movies

<a href="">6:00</a> Wow man, you&#39;re soooo hot yaar.

Even now many movies show this sort of crap 😂 rakhi sawant and KRK are carrying this trend forward

Oh God! What kind of movies have you watched to make these videos?
I never thought I would say this but Fardeen Khan was better than others.

Fardeens  wasn&#39;t too bad tbh

Your intro is annoying

Plz more like this for 2010-19  movies

U missed salman s all movies after 2010

Who watches such slow movies!!!
Respect for you man for finding these lost gems from our Hindi film Industry

I hate Bollywood,I go for PewDiePie!

Fardeen Khan was still better than most ,oh that Jewel of 2000s !

What a non sense direction and acting...in Hollywood these stupids would be kicked out and a notice would be made to keep these useless out of Hollywood

Can you speak in hindi from next time

Love at times square-Phone pe baat karte karte Dhamaka hua...Plane me baat kaise Kar rahe the??Akhand Chutiyapa...

Thanks for spoiling my day

Dude... You have a good voice over, with a good command over grammar and pronunciation. Kudos man..... Well, I say that coz am a comms trainer in a BPO n the English I hear, even on TV channels is hilarious. For example, Amit Shah visited a Police memorial recently to observe the valAUr, not valor. Am amused as to how do these anchors get on national TV. 😂😂

Omg 4.45 i died laughing.. 😂😂😂😂😂

That&#39;s a good voice

You are still talking a lot...a little less, focus on video
I don't speak Hindi, brother.
Didnt feel any overacting in fardeen&#39;s clip

Title English ,narration English,Indian movie,Hindi language. You making video for whom

That&#39;s why I don&#39;t watch Bollywood except Akki movies.Salo Ko acting hi nhi ahti.Bollywood is just a joke.Bollywood don&#39;t have any class

Where is our Selmun bhoi and Varunardo DiCaprio?

Thanks Now I can’t sleep for at least 2 days

I love Rekha 😂
Hhahah

Missing chutiya baba ram rahim
Lol mein use paana chahta hoon, paana chahta hoon, paana chahta hoon…
Fardeen khan is a good actor and he has done nothing bad as far as acting is considered. . He is much better than Tushar Kapoor and Abhishek. He is an underrated actor.

Hindi mei bol bhai
Krk ko bhool Gaye Kiya

Hindi v bol leya kar
U forgot KRK😂

Plaaaneeee crash
U r so mean 😂🤣😂
Please share your views on this cringeworthy film named &quot;My Boss Bajrangbali&quot;. The action scene lasts for about 20 mins.. And I bet you guys just can&#39;t stop laughing..

&quot;The room&quot; is considered the worst movie made in Hollywood. Then I watched Sunil Anand.. n then thought of half of Bollywood movies.

Housefull 2 is a whole movie of overacting...

Brother you should speak in Hindi bcoz mostly Indians prefers Hindi ....

Yara Laia!!!!
Brother, have you forgotten the gabbar of the school, have you forgotten the twinkle of the fair, sometimes happiness is because of the sorrow, I am crazy about my love, the song is the tune of the useless month.
It&#39;s not about actors but directors

Main bhi school days main aise hi acting karta tha..!!You missed me too.!!

I don’t know where to start!!!!!!

Actually master has a good concept

Bollywood is a garbage

Hahahahahahah......They are so pathetic...Lol.....

SRK should win best overactor of all time award in Bollywood !

Sonam kapur nd salman khan should be included in yr list

Main prem ki dewani hoon is not in the list????? 😲😲😲

I just realised that there are way more shitty movies in the world than i could possibly watch.

Too much of ur bak bak in between

Hahahaha bhai why are you so late?
<a href="">4:53</a> Dev Anand and plane crash like what ..... 😂😂🤦‍♀️
Bhai sabb said yes... but Hindi movies... sare Hindi scenes.. and you did commentary in English.. wahh shabaas. When the scene of Hindi is based on the video, I say it in Hindi, brother... we will go to society.
Brother I speak in Hindi
What about Shiny Ahuja in Bhool Bhulaiyya 🙄🙄

Considering Rajesh Khanna &amp; Dev Anand, I think these were one of the worst actors apart from 1-2 films ... other films of them were hit due to other reasons like plot or music. Dev anand was same throughout his career. His films were hit due to vijay anand or guru dutt , I must agree, dev anand had good sense of music, that too I doubt when he made films like mister prime minister with pathetic music 🙄

You must watch preity zinta in dil chahta hai saying the dialogues &quot;sorry rohit me tmse shadi nai kr sakti&quot; uffff very bad acting I must say in that particular scene

Please do come up with a full episode on the Movie &#39;Guide&#39;...,one of the greatest movie made in bollywood history....you often neglect the old gems.

Brother, I have never heard the name of this film.
Fardeen was not bad

Knock knock knock knock knock knock knock......

This is going to give me nightmares

Plaaaane crashhhh
The funniest Indian film which makes me laugh Even tho it was designed as an action adventure film is Tehelka,with corny and cheesy dialogues from stars like Dharmendra ,Naseerudin etc.

Who was the directors who approved those horrible scenes. They deserved awards &amp; respect for their contributions to Indian cinema.

KRK's deshdrohi doesnt count as film ..
If you look closely the so called overacting is very similar to some good acting by top actors. But when you look unattractive, your slight overacting which might be required for commercial cinema would be looked at in a funny way. The film critics should try acting in a commercial movie and then they would know

Josh e javani movie... Prakash I ❤️Rekha....I ❤️ Rekha 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
“Why he isn’t he taking workshops on acting” ROFL 😂😂

I hate Salman khan,  he is such a lame,  no acting skills,  a murderer, a tatti hero

Some of them are results of nepotism

<a href="">5:22</a>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<a href="">5:40</a>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey brother, tell me one thing, why are you doing so much torture on yourself just to entertain humans... You must have started watching the whole movie...
U forgot to mention amir khan,s early movie in which he is playing a snake charmer .

You missed the gem KRK&#39;s Deshdrohi

Hilarious😂
You missed Nemar..most versatile and highly overacted....beating all hollywood and bollywood actor...😂

After watching all the movies, the mind becomes crazy.
U did hard work for the video ...u HV to bear all that scenes 😂😂😂..... selute u...

Include Hrithik's acting in 'mai prem ki deewani hun' movie...
Janasheen movie shouldnt be in this list, itna bura nahi kiya fardeen ne us scene me....overall bhi movie achchhi thi, ....and firoz khan sir was treat to watch.....

1st one is just too nostalgic

I love Rekha ......aaaahhhaaa I love Rekhaa....aaahhaa....kikikiron.....Aahhaa
Oh my God, how did I get the network on Devanand's wife's phone?
what&#39;s the name of the MUSIC at the beginning?????????

I was feeling shy watching those actings..

celina  ko  dekh  ke

You forgot to mention All Salman khan movies

laila  murdered

Hv you watched kareena kapoor in khushi, main prem ki deewani hun, kkkg...she was epitome of Overacting at tht time...

No prem aggan? No haseen dard? Seriously?
Oh come on.. Fardeen was not bad.

Are you brother in Hindi?
Movies of salman khan....pathetic acting

bro....dont criticize evrything....sm scenes r not as ridiculous z u r explaining.

Fardeen Khan was alright in that sceneNot the best but not for sure bad

KRK dying in deshdrohi is the unlisted 1

For the first time it was really really difficult to watch your video

Dude you talk a lot.

You earned my subscription. Well entertaining. Good work.

List is incomplete without a Salman Khan movie

Try to watch balakrishna movies . Supposedly Telugu film industy Michael Jackson

How can you forget hritik roshan movies! All of them are overacted! The absolute gem is main prem ki Deewani hoon!....the whole film is cringe!

Can&#39;t watch anymore.enough for today

Rakesh bedi would have been cursing himself for acting in that movie

Dev aanand was a stock of laugh before as well as in any era he was not legend

Happens often in  Bollywood

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI saw this Josh e jawani movie years ago...I thought it was a cheap late 80s or early 90s song...I loved this ek do teen chaar song...my childhood song ^^^Check out that song!!!! You saved my life dude!!

if only he could be speechless

I was expecting &quot;mai prem ki deewani hoon&quot; !

I wasn&#39;t sure whether Bunty Bedi loves Rekha or Rakesh Bedi..... 🙊

Fucking funny

Who talks on the phone on the plane?
Plz make a video on mirzapur  and secred games web series

U sound like karan johar.

You should add jani dushman whole cast.

Rajesh khanna was uncalled forFardeen khan was not that bad and I stopped the video after himFarzi video

Hrithik Roshan And Kareena Kapoor ka woh Bakawaas film is a full fledged overacting kaa Documentary.

U guys rock👌👌👌👍
Parkash. I hate acting.

I love rekha.
Bhai Salman's fans are not there, his name is not in the list.
No matter what they do...not me...in everyone
Ewwww Saaley mere bhaai ko chhod do....sonu Nigam JAANI DUSHMAN

We all use the expression “oh I could have done that so much better” at some point in our lives. I think that jail scene with dev anand’s son is the worst thing I have ever seen. I swear I could probably acted that scene much better than him atleast 😂😂😂

Shah rukh khan in recent past
Rajesh Khanna paad
Never heard  single name amongst the list 🙄🤔🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂

<a href="">4:42</a> &quot;plane pe bateien karte  karte .logoki chikhe and plane crush.&quot; It was freaking hilarious.

Last wala legendary tha😂😂😂

The list was hilarious. But I believe Bollywood has lots of such scenes which may require a series on this type of videos

Dev Anand is overrated.

Remembering the sacrifice of UDYA CHOPRA...
99% Indian movies are over acting.....second there is no acting, just looks

hahaha

Baap re baap so dangerous overacting ya ya kaho kaho aana ka acting kya hai Why made these films ?
We know fardeen Khan is a bad actor but that scene is not that badly enacted

Omg, i can&#39;t believe it

Becharo ! I feel sorry for you guys ! You have to watch and go through these crappy movies to give us these hilarious mocumentaries ! Kaise dekh lete ho yaar ?? Dimag ka to bina doodh ke dahi ho jayega !

Amir Khan&#39;s performance in Dhoom-3, Mela and recent Blockbuster Thugs of Hindostan.

Sunil Anand and Salman Khan&#39;s acting is very similar. That furniture scene is the best example of this.

Hahahaha

You are overacting the most because the movie is in Hindi or you are speaking in English.
Where is the father of overacting - Shahrukh ?

My Eyes are at Great Pain😭 now, after Seeing These Legends doing Acting😱

Lots of respect to you man, tou saw all this  shit to create content for us. Massive Salute

For God Sake leave Dev Sahab. His  contribution is golden era for us. I am going to hate you for this. There are 100 idiots including our great 3 idiot (dogle) khans.

Plane crash 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂

Fardeen Khan was not that bad.He was very talented.Few other mentions include Akshay Khanna,Raghubir Yadav,Sonu Sood,Sanjay Suri,Raj Zutshi etc.These are unsung heroes or actors in Bollywood&#39;s recent past.Far better than today&#39;s bodybuilders turned actors.

Lol

thought your voice is good...you look far more adorable...

I like the job ur doing but i would love it if u had taken the overacting scenes from successful movies rather than from flop movies. Like Kareena in KKKG.

Love your voice and the way of narrating the story... Awesome...!!! Just subscribed 👍

😂 funny

How did u watch those movies

Hello music at the start of the video title?  Thank you

Tiger Shroff in Baghi 2 at  specially emotional and anger scene🤯

Cant believe u actually watched these..!           <b>feeling sorry</b>

Dr. Baba Ram Rahimji what is a human being??
By explaining Hindi movies in English, Hollywood will make them. Bol in Hindi.
Don&#39;t say u have to watch all these movies?

Make a video about movies that should have a sequel

Trolololololol

I feel bad, for you to go through all these movies to make a video.I&#39;m dropping a like.

Omg!! Did u watch these movies before making this video...🤥

Good content and great presentation. You certainly have a great command on English language which makes the presentation very appealing

I laughed so hard from 1.44 onward scene

Fardeen wlaa bekar tha

Every actor has his decade and his/her acting has been adapted for that decade unless that actor manage to adapt themselves according to demand of fans of that decade

There are more than a few cartoons
You missed the Faisal Khan in &quot;Aur Chand Bhujh Gaya&quot; . The milestone.

Bad choice of selecting movies...

Devanand is shit. Who the fuck talks on phone during flight? Illiterates

I love that there are 80 overacting actors in Bollywood and they are also super stars.
The master of all overacting is shah rukh khan acting in the prison scene in Ram jaane and in darrr also some scenes of deewana

Fart hahaha

fardeen acting is good not bad

Hum sath sath hain.. Entire movie was over

&quot;✈  crash&quot;😂😂😂😂

Plane crash😂I love rekha😂

Bollywood shitshow

where is Salman Khan 😂

I expected the entirety of mein prem ki dewaani hoon and deshdrohi on this. And gunda. And basically any fardeen khan movie (except no entry). Especially prem aggan. And also expected tum mere ho.

fardeen ka scene to a66a tha

Just pick up any Dev Anand movie, especially the movies he made during later part of his life..... And you will have non stop comedy.

i don&#39;t think devanand is a gd actor ever

It's not josh aey.. It's pronounced joshey josh ay jowani read as joshe jowani
Fardeen is good here!

The movies with not a single moment without over actingMe prem ki diwani huKabi khushi kabi gamKuch kuch hota heHum saath saath hain

Dev Anand and last one was hilarious..😂😂😂😂😂😂

Plane crash 😂😂

I think you didn&#39;t watch South Indian movies 🤣🤣

Dude you sound like Fardeen Khan...! 😂😂

Mad in india

yes he deserves Oscar but he hates main nahi gand main
How can you forget karle pyaar kar le? 😂😂

Buddy !! Why your videos always target bollywood ?? Make something on hollywood , there are plenty of such hilarious things in their movies too !! All these movies  are a decade old and were a flop at box office thus forgotten and unknown ! Try making videos on embracing what good we have instead of what already is ignored by all.

People in India Pakistan shit on the roof tops and shit on roads, dirty bastards

Shut up fool with your FAKe western accent hahaahahahahahahahahahah

Shifu means Master in Chinese... its not a name stupid..😂😂😂😂

Srk is Hijra

Can you figure it out  Hollywood&#39;s​ Biggie&#39;s overacting moments, or you simply aren&#39;t bothered !!

Love at time square 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

That's why brother, before seeing all this, I realized why I am so talented.. I had tears in my eyes.
Overacting baat chal rahi then hw can u forget SRK n KRK... they are masters in overacting😅😅😅

<a href="">4:28</a> sweety darlings expression PRICELESS😂

Sunil Aanand and Salman Khan are absolutely on the same level in acting.
Missing Akshay kumaar in once upon time in Mumbai 2
Plane crash😂
Annoying voice
what about mithun chakraborthy, jackie shroff, all shits of bollywood. to be honest this dev anand, rajesh khanna, manoj kumar, rajendra kumar and many more were in the beginning era of the bollywood and it was very new thing to the people of india, thats y they got fame otherwise they do shit only in the name of acting. Still now 70% of the indian citizen are of lower class who doesnt know enough about the acting skills etc, so nothing can be expected from them, n that is the reason that even shitty movie earns a lot. just show them some dink chik, nanga naach, some flying auto rickshow action scene, salman khan or akshay kumar and dark comedy double meaning language and thats it, movie will make box office hit.

Actually the last one was a lot less ridiculous than the rest.

Fart scene of Rajesh khanna 😂😂😂

Wtf

My head is hurting

&quot;Main Prem ki deewani hoon&quot; the ultimate overacting saga

😂😂😂😂😂

waves of cringe linger over my body yuuuk

A very B LIST  LIST.

KRK performance in &quot;Deshdrohi&quot; needs your attention please make a video on that 🤣

I&#39;m procrastinating at work while watching this. I just lost my breath laughing

Lol!!

Did u really really watched all that crap??

And ya you must make a video on the worst horrible work of our so called stars in their old age like rajesh khanna, feroz khan, dharmendra, dev anand etc it was like they are taking some revenge by making, producing, directing and acting such horrible movies in 90s

I think this list could be filled by all films acted and directed by dev anand in late 80s and 90s. All the movies were shit full of foreign locations foreigner characters which was like a shadow of his films of stardom period. And ofcourse these films have worst fashion sense also. You can make video on worst and best fashion sense of actors and actresses

I have always found dev anand as a shitty actor even in his &quot;prime&quot;.

salman in most of his films from 1997 to 2010.he acted like a cartoon.hahahahahahha

Why don&#39;t you join and teach Bollywood about filmmaking, acting and everything related to it

OK PEOPLE DIe stuggle to get a platform t show the actiing skill.....lucky people star sons gets it n  ruins it ccmpletly

Hilarious! 😂😂😂
Worst actor in the history dev anand .... Na shakal na akal na acting ....

why dont u make a movie as a director and find some zero mistakes.

It was excellent method acting from dev anand and rajesh khanna

Parkash I love Rekha I love Rekha Jabbardast acting hai yaar
Kareena kapoor  in main prem ki diwani hoon and kabhi khusi khabi gam

Mai prem ki deewani hu deserves an Oscar for overacting

This is tradition, isn't it?!!!!!
Paana chaata hu ..Paana chaata hu ...😂😂😂😂
agree with all of the picks except the Fardeen Khan one. Its your bias against his abilities as an actor which makes you see that scene as cringy. I thought it was a pretty normal scene, the one you showed...

Even i love rekha
Madarchod is commenting on Hindi films in English...If you want to do Dev Anand's acting, you will go to hell if you don't care.
Amisha patel you started liking me
You forgot salman khan in all his movies. (Oh the hate I’m going to receive after this comment)

yaadein hrithik
Who watch these type of movies?

acting actor karte he sada se uthaye gaye tatpunjiye nahi
I never knew these films even exist 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Are you recording with a 150/-rs head phone. You proved you are an Indian.

NCS ROCKS! If u knw what I mean

All Indians movies are overacting

I think only Amitabh Bachchan maintained his acting skills from start of his career to till now ...

abhishek bacchan ki filmy kyu chod di..

When will such a film be released..maybe it will be released on Mars.
Lord your voice has to be heard..
You forgot &quot;Main prem ki deewani hoon&quot; 😑😕The height of overacting in that stupid movie was intolerable.

Baapre and what about legends like himesh bhai, krk chutiya and balatkari baba shaitan

you missed Siddhart  mallothra movies.

last wala actor kon tha..Konsi bedi ka aulad? Dev anand hamesha hi khrp/over acting krta tha it just got noticed later

Govinda, Salman Khan, Mithun and Varun Dhawan are masters in overacting

Plane crash
Try watching “Sanam harja” and see the acting there!😂

Laila khan
Ohkay.. So everonye is talking abt either KRK or Hrithik. But no one can beat Amir Khan&#39;s performance in Tum Mere Ho..

Bollywood is so disappointing on many fronts.

I only know jaanashen out of these movies..

I think u missed Kareena and Hritik&#39;s acting in Main Prem ki Deewani Hoon🤣

Srk ramjane chahat AK cctc

Indian films r troll to the whole world lol mostly based on overacting

You forgot  Prem agan
Voice-over here is quite similar to JASPRIT BUMRAH&#39;S voice!

varun dhawan bakwas all film

Your video will be better if you stop your Indian accent English commentary which is annoying and ugly to hear. No foreigner is going to watch your video which is Hindi. You should do your commentary in Hindi

Subscribed your channel.I think you can save a lot of time with quality. infotainmentThanks.

I look frwd to ur videos and they r crisp and to the point.... Keep up the gd wrk

Bro ur english 👍👍👍👍
Wat abt abhishek bacchan in Drona 2008

Fardeen Khan was ok add Sonu Nigam in Jaani Dushman or entire cast of that film

Dev anand reminds me of tommy wiseau the room

Have you forgotten Himesh Reshammiya?
Do something productive instead of bringing other people down. At least they tried something and failed.

Who are you worrying about, brother? You are spreading the knowledge of acting.
I can&#39;t stand overacting of hritik Roshan, varun, arjun Kapoor I accept ones from big b, akshay Kumar, sunil shetty

Hahahaha...rajesh khanna scene... Fardeen was horrible in Prem agan..i think d best overacting award shud be given to Shahrukh in Duplicate n Hrithik in MPKDH

Kripaya apni phone ko flight mode par rakhe, thank you 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Awesome.

How was his wife even getting a telephone connectivity while flying on the plane? How stupid!!!

Rajesh khanna frequently put his hand on face because that was his facepalm moment. Regretting doing that film by seeing that lady&#39;s acting skill lol

What can I say in Hindi?
You probably know the enemy, love has been forgotten...or b bht h
your list contains unknown actors apart from fardeen khan. dev anand and rajesh khanna were legends in their time. good to see big stars in videos like this like for example salman khan in hello brother

I was expecting solmen Khan lol

Jimmypant bhai. May be you skipped Kareena Kapoor in Khushi

The last one, SRK, nahi, KRK&#39;s acting hero

I an describe all bollywood films I 2 words onlt &#39; love , and revenge or action and romance .there are no other emotions rather than anger and love

I can&#39;t stop laughing😂😂😂

Losers 🤪
We have a bhojpuri song --&quot; raat Diya buta ke piya Kya Kya Kiya &quot; look at dance steps of Pawan Singh..pls make some video regarding this bullshit song

Obviously... The list  was incomplete without fardeen 😂

You forget every hindi film post 2004. They are all rubbish

Oh God... x_x

I expected a full video about kareena kapoor😂😂😂

Dev Anand is a great actor but after 1990s.......no comments.

You use hindi films for your videos with English commentary, really doesn&#39;t made for each other and your narration is very serious... The language just don&#39;t connect if you are making fun of a hindi film scene. Use hindi... Just an advice..

Twinkle Khanna mela
I love your voice man!❤️
I love Rekha ❤️
For first 15 years, this was Shah Rukh Khan’s standard of acting in almost every movie. He has got retrained only in last 10 years.

Can you do a video to troll MTV reality shows, like top 10 stupidest moments in MTV Roadies, or Splitsvilla or something similar?

Main usse khona nahi <b>shakes head yes</b> paana chata hu
Here are some suggestions for your video. Idk whether you have already made them or not.1. Top Bollywood cult movies.2. Top Bollywood non mainstream movies3. Bollywood movies that has inspired hollywood4. What is the future of Bollywood. Is there a chance that art movies make a comeback?5. Why Bollywood never makes realistic movies?6. Why Bollywood is all about good looks and glam sham , and not about real talent? 7. Why Bollywood is scared of experiments?8. When will the Kapoor family come to an end?

I must say that your channel is SO underrated! Keep up the good work :)

Please make video in Hindi

Fardeen can act tho😦

Bhai English sikhne ki tips dedo

There &#39; My pram is dewani hun why u forget ?
I lost it when he said &quot;Ahh! Plane Crash&quot; 😂😂😂😂

Fardeen K. wasn&#39;t that bad in the scene. I think the director n the editor also need to be blamed for such scenes.

that farting scene😂😂

why is nobody talking about the Khan&#39;s who are horrible actors except Amir who is a gem to the Indian cinema,but Srk and Salman, 1).Salman was always a terrible dancer  and everybody knows that, and sucks at acting and how can u forget to mention Shah rukh Khan&#39;s overreacting in his movies which is too much that must be why his movies can&#39;t be watched until u are fed up with his overreacting that is why I think he should start to act like a natural born actor and not someone who is forcing himself to act, just watch his duplicate and more movies of his with so much overreacting. that is my opinion,no hate and yes whatever an actor they are and I really appreciate the fact there are many Indian&#39;s who love them,no matter how terrible actors they are...

<b>I can&#39;t believe the Rajesh Khanna portion</b> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Where is Salman khan??

Watch new marathi movie trailer nude
Salman khan acting was not good in that new movie with that Chinese actress his crying looked like he was making fun

Another great video dude. Couldn’t stop lafing on few of them.Btw do a video ranking the Khiladi films from Akshay. That will be worth a watch.

I don't want to know about the video but my heart feels happy after listening to your English.
Mummy nahi rahi sweety darling..haha 😅plane crashhhh
Bollywood ka sb se <b>Chutiya</b> actor tha <b>Rajesh Khanna</b>

Don&#39;t be over smart. They are legend. Their acting is relevant or they performed according to the time and space of the society. Your videos will also become rubbish after 50 to 100 year beacuse it  will become irrelevant with time. Judging those movies based on todays fact  and technology will be absolutely rediculous. Making a movie is very tough task in the world. No movies can be made perfect by all angles like script, cinematography, camera movements, story telling,direction,edit,music,title,etc. I suggest you should make a short movie will know the obsticles and how hard is to produce a movie. It is easy to critize a movie or it is easy to complain or find mistakes in a movie but every movie is made with hard labour and no one in the world whether a producer or a director will want to make a flop movie. Please show some respect because words are bitter than action.

You missed varun dhavan in judwa2(almost his evry movie)

Just one querry... how do u get courage to watch such movies...??? 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂

You forgot Salman Khan for his consistency of putting just one expression his whole movies

Bollywood means  fuck off

Brother, if you like acting then you can log in here.
bhai hindi me video hota to aur fun ata dekhne me
Dude u forgot Leave...
Gadgets 2 use ka intro chura Liya tu khud chor hai be dusre Ko kya bolta hai

This is nice but i think u shud put some new movies so that the younger (some of these movies r just too old! 😋) generation of viewers can relate to and the new gen actors can learn a lesson. Hw abt some popular stars - salman ( hum dil de chuke sanam climax) , srk ( has many to his credit) , katrina ( more lyk under acting)... etc. Sonu nigam ... himesh....and  such &quot;wana b actors&quot; with no skills.

Man, those fart sounds ...hahaha, brilliant

😂😂

police commissioner in film officer , legend KRK is desh drohi missing

I am overacting.
Do you watch all the movies you feature in videos... ?

Brother, if you are talking about India then you will speak in Hindi.
You forgot most of Salman Khan performances. Also at least some performances of SRK should have also been included.

Where is Tiger Shroff in ll his movies tbh 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝

See the Fardeen Khan&#39;s first film...Prem agan I think...so worse acting, especially dialogue delivery...Also, how can anyone forget Kareena Kapoor in her earlier films like Khushi, K3G, mujhse Dosti karoge, Main Prem ki deewani (in this Hritik too), etc.

In 90s Dev shab was lost out his mind

Janasheen was a movie?

Master was a mind blaster

Fardeen was good..

TRP&#39;S Sabse bakwaas video hain yeh !

That is not hilarious!!That&#39;s just how Fardeen acts

CHANDAAL,JALLAD,YAMRAJ,GUNDA,SHAPATH,ZEHRILA

How do you get the stamina to watch all this bakwaas? I am sure you are truly dedicated to your list... Hats off to your work/list

Plane crash :p
1.28😂

Missing SRK from Don 2.

Brother, why did you get lucky in the film direction?
The cringe is strong with this one

You should also make a video on greatest acting moments in Bollywood. How about that? For example: Shahid Kapoor&#39;s monologue in Haider, any Naseeruddin Shah&#39;s scene in A Wednesday, or Amitabh Bachchan&#39;s character teaching Michelle her first word &#39;Water&#39; in Black etc.

Make a video on Worst villains of indian cinema..

hey man pls upload new video &quot;Upcoming brilliant masterpieces of Indian Cinema&quot; including &quot;Omerta&quot;

oh man did u watch all these movies ,I really feel pity for u but really nice work man

faltu bakwass

Dharmendra in loha
2.45 lady just farted

Man!!! The things you have to watch for the sake of this channel. I feel sorry for you 😂😂

Unsubscribed your channel, poor selection.
Celina was bullshit fardeen is awesome than varun dhaean and all

How cld frgt shardha Kapoor in ek taah villain

You missed Varun Dhawan in judwaa 2

Fardeen was not bad in that video.

Dev Anand ka to aisa nahi matlab bhai kuch bhi and Aditya Chopra Varun Dhawan where all this?
Make a video on best war films in Bollywood

What about overacting in main Tera hero

Supperb video... Talented bro

Awesome farts

Awesome Farta

youtube need a Ha Ha react

Sometimes even if he is seriously praising someone i think he is being sarcastic and when he is being sarcastic i think he is serious so damn confusing😅😂 any way his work is praiseworthy

You guys forgot Varun Dhawan
Akshay shilpa and Suniel shetty in DHADKAN were thr epitome of overacting

Your V.O. sort of ruins the impact the scenes would’ve otherwise created. Please don’t use so much of V.O. during the scenes?

How can you forget Varun Sir 😂

How can you forget the greatest cinematic gem ever &#39;Deshdrohi&#39;? That movie is a cult starring the legendary movie star KRK who deserves an Oscar Award for such an unbelievable performance. I bet Leonardo Di&#39;Caprio&#39;s &#39;Revenant&#39; is nothing infront of Deshdrohi.The legend will be remembered forever. This my tribute to him 🖕

Rajesh Khanna might be doing face palm due to absolutely shit acting by the actress in Wafaa. But you never know, she might actually be doing fart bombs on the set!!

dont u agree guys but some of those movies were nice

hahaha

Make a part 2 .. it was hilarious..

Not really
Dev anand acting was hilarious😂😂😂 and the girl&#39;s reaction...i mean wtf😂😂

Varun Dhawan in all of his films.. I haven&#39;t seen a hero who overacts as much as him..

I love Rekha...what should I do?
Good content man.. Please make a video on best indian tv drama like kuch rang pyar ke aise bhi on sony tv, sasural genda phool, meri bhabhi, on star plus.. Tv serial which had some sensible story line, relatable to audiences, good cast, great acting and good direction.. And which were not long lasting but were telecasted for a limited time and ended well..

Anmol bhai, you have lost KRK(Deshdrohi), Sonu Nigam(Jaani Dushman) and Hrithik Roshan(Main Prem ki Deewani).
bhai waiting for part 2

WTF

Ary bhai english mat bol yar plz
Its too cringie.... I can&#39;t watch it

Can you please talk less and get to the point real quick ? ( All your videos ) . Otherwise all great.

Brother, do you watch all these movies?? Very nice brother.
.Plz come back  Frdeen sir
Your voice is the star! ❤ Steals the show! ❤

Plane main phone per baat karogey to plane crash hoga hin .

You chose wrong clip of fardeen khan he wasn&#39;t that bad in that scene. There are lot of worst performance scenes in Prem Agan.

You should leave these b grade cinema. Nobody takes them seriously and nobody watches them. You should have mentioned A List actors overacting moments. That would been great!

Bro I am again requesting bring back previous intro music...

Last one tho😂😂

Thnk god have just watched one.. Janasheen.. Songs achchhe the by the way uske.. Baakiyo ka naam hi aaj suna bc😂😂

dev anand was a shitty actor.

Shah Rukh Khan - Pretty much every movie barring a few like Swades

1. Hrithik Roshan in Main Prem Ki Dewani hoon..2. KrK in Desh Drohi..3. Amisha Patel in Aap Mujhe Achey Lagne Lage..4. Salman Khan in most of his movies 5. Sonam Kapoor in most of her movies 6. Sonu Nigam in(all time worst movie) Jaani Dushman..7. Varun Dhawan in Dishoom..AND EVERYONE IN HOUSEFUL 1 2 &amp; 3..

Deepika padokone is padmaavat !

Hahahaha the farting noise intrigued a rolling belly laughter man....fucking awesome

I literally just came back from dramatics practice after hearing a shitload of &quot;y&#39;all can&#39;t act&quot;. Honestly feeling SO much better

Wtf😂😂😂😂💯💯💯
Bollywood=Shit

you should make a video about the speeches of rahul gandhi 😂😂

Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand we’re past their primes in the 80s.

how could you miss main prem ki deewani Hoon? Each and every character in that was high on drugs while shooting it 🙀🙄

Wow good 1
This channel is like India&#39;s &#39;watch mojo&#39;.. Very good effort brother.. explaining things loud and clear!

thanks... buddy

you must see the dev anand film “sachche ka bolbala” The famous airport attack scene &amp; dev saabs performance is outstanding. The way he says “Koi... aataaankwadi hai shayad” 😄

I didn&#39;t find fardeen over the top.

Ohhh my God.. ShockShocked first by watching legends r done these kind of movies n second laugh a lot

No Srk in the list???Overacting ka king to wahi hai

Where is Arjun kapoor ? He is overacting ki dukan. Where is siddharth malhotra in bar bar dekho? Katrina kaif in almost ALL movies ?!! We need PART 2 😂😂😂😂

While flying on the plane from Ranchi, I heard something in the air, a bang, people screamed…and Plaaaaaayyyynneee Crashhhhh
Out Of Content Who The Hell You Think You Are You Disrespect All The Legends Of Indian Cinema Plz I Requested You Plz Stop Your Channel

Make the best worst/bad Bollywood movies, please.

U r always awesome jammy😍😍
Plain Crash boooom..... 😂😂

Bhai I have just 1 Question .. you watched this all movies ??? Because after this video Himmat hi nahi ki yeh movie galti se bhi dekhun

This list wasn&#39;t adequate 😑 Some of the most overacted scenes are missing and some scenes like Fardeen&#39;s are unnecessarily added 😡

Your content is so great honestly ! You deserve million subscribers

why fardeen khan..? he was convincing in his role...

why fardeen khan..? he was convincing in his role...

Make opposite version of this video
