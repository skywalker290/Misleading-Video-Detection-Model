Pewds: &quot;Good Morning Gamers, WHAT A NICE MINECRAFT DAY THIS IS!!&quot;

Less than a minute later : <b>pure chaos</b>

Can someone please tell me what the heck happened?

That water sheep&#39;s course for killing him

<a href="">1:58</a>

Pewdiepie has learned more about Minecraft in a couple months than I did in well over a decade. I must, say I&#39;m impressed

This is why I turn off fire spreads lol

Lava used to be so annoying on Minecraft. You would make lava dumps like Felix to throw stuff you didn&#39;t need in, and they would end up setting fire to wood that was like <i>five blocks</i> away.I believe they&#39;ve fixed this now, though.

These last few minecraft episodes are just like the last days of school because it is all fun

when Minecraft grease fire goes bad

so we are just descending into madness now

Ik this is late but this may be scripted. <a href="">2:31</a>. I’m assuming a 2nd player (maybe the 2nd account to film his 3rd person pov montages) went invisible and lit the house, but accidentally holds a fishing rod.

100M subs and he posts laggy video in 720p

Ingvar is Creepus Kreist, suffering for sins of other creepers 

creepers r the worst mobs ever, bruh

Ingvar was always one of us...

“This is worse than my house being robbed… in real life.”

Pewdiepie fans: &quot;Who set the mansion on fire?&quot;Pewdiepie: &quot;It was me Nineteen Year Olds, It was me all along Ninteen Year Olds. You all bought it, you all bought it Hook, Line, and Sinker. Even Edgar bought it. Even my immediate family bought it. All of you were made fools of.&quot;

CEO of &quot;Whats that?&quot;

&quot;This is even worse than my house being robbed in real life&quot;Shows how much he cared about minecraftem

<a href="">5:14</a> im a creeper-

I GOT AN AD FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AFTER HIS HOUSE BURNT DOWN

Did he just built IKEA tower

at vedio

at exact <a href="">1:20</a> I saw flying fire did you,reply

Is he doing it in creative mode.

i like how pewds said it was a simple elevator and he says its done and i can barely see how it works

he could have jst place water and it would stop -1000 IQ to remember it after 6 min

<a href="">3:30</a>, when it burned down. He just loaded up a previous version, right? He didn&#39;t rebuild it? Anyone else think he&#39;s a little sus?

Ppl watching pewdiepie for the first time be like “ what the ......

Not gonna lie miss PewDiePie old house

so he is using creative

Pewdiepie :this Redstone is very simple Mumbo-jumbo:yes yes YES HAHAHAHAHAHA my plan worked perfectly

STOP KILLING CHICKENS

Felix what is that floating fishing rod in <a href="">2:31</a> and <a href="">2:32</a> ? huhhhh

Instead can u build a TNT Cannon

Why so laggy

yes

He is obviously going to create mode

Pewdiepie got karma xD for killing chickens

Ingvar: kidnapped, their friends murdered, tortured and sodomised. Somehow they&#39;re the villain in this whole situation.

Where&#39;s ulla britta

Jack Black got into his house again

Burning of Alexandria colourized?

Ingvar’s living is best life with those chickens

Me when PewDiePie is explaining his redstone placement on his elevator:What language is that

Breaking news: The legendary PewDiePie Minecraft house was caught on fire

No the fire spirit

<a href="">7:44</a> does anyone know the name of this song?

Felix: the gist will be pretty simple......Also Felix: <a href="">5:32</a>

Do you know about nether arrmoor

<a href="">11:45</a> why do you have a stack of obsidian and piston?

i am better than dream lol

I&#39;m surprised Ingvar hasn&#39;t died from entity cramming yet. maybe its because of the fences.

I love how he used Banjo Kazooie sounds for all of the &quot;dialogue.&quot; It&#39;s very appropriate lol.

They way ain’t workers is vErY simple Yea I totally believe you

Da creeper is so dumb

<a href="">7:22</a> Has wut???

<a href="">6:32</a> Heren!

What about the pewdiepie promise... i wont use creative mode...

<a href="">9:41</a>

Dont use wood next time, use wool.

Do take care

<a href="">0:03</a> today is a beautiful day10 sec later : WHY IS THIS HAPPENING

The noises for the characters ruined the series

His descent to insanity truly began the day he killed Sven&#39;s BF...

<a href="">4:30</a>

One of the zombies dbed

ThePewidepie fans like BROLAND WORLDand the  pew die pie  chickens also like BRO LAND WORLD

Felix finding a way to receive donations jk

FAKE COUNCIL OF WATER-SHEEP!!! IT IS TWO BLUE ONE YELLLOW. ORIGINAL HAD TWO YELLOW AND ONE BLUE!!!

Pewdiepie castle burns

I LOVE HOW YOU ACT 

PEWDS:- if any creeper blows up something then engmar has to pay message to all creepers watching the video!!Me:- What the helllllll hoe did he get to know!!!

Eeeeeeeeeeee

I love how you can see the flint and steel in his inventory

It ain&#39;t my fault its ingvar&#39;s fault sayonnara ingvar-san |:3

“Where are you guys?” LMAO

Rip fps

<a href="">5:33</a> did anyone see the lighting go down?

I never noticed how GOD DAMN BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE FELIX!!

2021?

i would have quit if all my chests were burned. i was in shock that entire fire

Looks like someone wasn’t subscribed to ibxtoycat

anyone going to to about pewd&#39;s hair?

<a href="">2:30</a> look EXTREMELY CAREULLY theres a person invisible holding a fishing rod

Do a video showing all your tattos and what would you like to do more (that cannon the greatest swedish invetions)

Wow evolution is real

Pewds created the most complex elevator when there are even more simpler one&#39;s.

how can not die

I see invisible player <a href="">2:30</a>

Villagers: &quot;help us we&#39;re still inside the sheep!! We haven&#39;t eaten in days!!! We have been stuck at that frick chamber for so long and the food isn&#39;t coming down what&#39;s going on?!?!?!&quot;Pewds: &quot;G E T  I N  T H E  B O A T !!!!

Sven is a god

This is unironically more entertaining that got season 8

What is the song playing when Ingavard escapes??? Can someone pls tell me?

What caused his house to burn down?

pewdiepie i need holy water

Imagine if someone didn&#39;t tell him to bring jöregen #1 and sleep at the nether

F F F F F in that chat

He could just build a tnt cannon instead of a whole readstone building.

At the beggining he didnt even knew how to play minecraft and now he builds a fuckin elevator. I cant even activate a piston.

the disaster happend when the watersheep came

can’t wait to tell my grandchildren about a legend called pewds

@<a href="">7:44</a>, I never imagined a chicken sucking off a creeper, but now ... whoa!

noo the chickenss

Pewdiepie: very hurt, starving to deathPewdiepie: so this is my elevator

from a noob redstoner to a guy that knows redstone that i cant even do in creative bc it confuses me to much

this is 10 episodes later after Sven&#39;s Bf dies.coincidence? i think not!

My favorite game from now is the poop game

carma case it happend right after he killed themmm chiken&#39;s

council of beetroot did this

I think he was in creative multible times this episode. What if he didnt make the meatball in survival

Plot twist water sheep caused the house fire

This man is the new mumbo jumbo

PewDiePie pet (sven) is the bast pet in minecraft

Is it just me or is there a floating fishing rod at <a href="">2:31</a>

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo two years later nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

<a href="">8:55</a> I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!

That&#39;s why we don&#39;t play with fire kids

Me: OMG SVEN DIES Pewdipies eyes: YES THIS IS WHAT CLICKBAIT DOES TO OUR FAME

Does anyone have a theory as to how the fire started? I doubt it was the lava tbh

I have a question.....what is he defending himself from???

You can tell when pewds is in creative, he zooms it in so you can&#39;t see the hotbar lol

holly shit man

Sorry about the house

Now guys you have to believe me. If you are a Minecraft veteran then you know how hard it is to find slimes. Felix doesn&#39;t even have a slime farm which is why I&#39;m almost 100% sure that he goes in creative mode to get the stuff he doesn&#39;t have.

Gaymers?

10 on 10 acting pewds

i love how he reacts

awards need to be made.Creeper blows up something that pewds wanted to destroy anyway: memorial made of stone.Creeper stops a mob from killing sven by blowing up: memorial of iron blocks.zombie stops skeleton arrow from killing sven when he is on 1 heart: becomes as powerful as watersheep and gets a temple

W3ll i saw this vid on the year this vid ws uploaded whe sven was on fire i was like what the

Where did he get all that slime

I&#39;m a chicken

<a href="">12:46</a> what episode was this?

how do you time stamp-.

&quot;this is a massage to all the creepers watching&quot; said a creeper fricker.

What is the song that is playing when Ingvard the Creeper escaped???

My Friend*Imagin a creeper wanting to hurt pewds Me* that’s gonna hurt

<a href="">1:26</a> u noob you could put water lol

did he set the whole temple on fire by himself?

<a href="">12:37</a> omg when was that

the rawknee games made an elevator way less space taking and better

Remember how he first said: &quot;what&#39;s this red stuff&quot;And now he&#39;s kind of a redstone expert

Wait the minute where is ulla britta

Sven falls one block PEWDS-EEEEATT. EEEEAT!!!!

&quot;so cute...! I mean CODE RED&quot;

Me:mad at my siblings taking my stuffPewdiepie: this is worse than my house being robed in real liveMe: how how??Why

Love how tired you were rebuilding that  forgot where camera was big brain 

This was 30 fps wth

Pewdiepie &quot; I love you sven my dog&quot;I thought your dog&#39;s name was edgar

I can’t tell what’s a meme and what’s real now...

or After you realize there&#39;s bees in minecraft. Im sorry im bad at English.

How you Got! honny block before for you realize there&#39;s bees in minecraft

idk why but I love the way he says &quot;&quot; to anyone inconveniencing him at all

why does he look like dr strange in this episode.

How did he get so many slimes ?!

Water sheep did it

<a href="">12:07</a>  WTF

It&#39;s funny when pewds fail LMAOOO hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

<a href="">5:17</a> i was like ‘PEWDS EAAAAATTTTT’

please do a tutorial on the underground glow stone swicth light

pewds: is it true that you corrupted my mindcouncil of watersheep: nopewds: understandable, have a great day

My question is was he cheating because how did he get that much slime

BRUH

<a href="">9:32</a> When you try to cheat on an Exam but you end up getting the wrong cheat sheet LOL

I miss Minecraft series about first episodes

Sven is a Undefeatable creature he never dies

When his house was burning and he found diamonds: I take that

Ingvar turned into the new watersheep when he dies pewds gonna be like &quot;he was like father to me&quot; and then hes gonna make like 3 monuments after him lol.

I think thumbnail was changed.

Laid

We need more cows, sheep and pigs again!

notice at 1250 he has lots of items at full stock so he must have gone into creative

Swedish Man is cursed by the legacy of water sheep.. the water sheep always loved him till it&#39;s death even though he harrased him to his Death... It&#39;s the curse of water sheep...It&#39;s the curse of disliking unfounded love...

Pewds making a tnt cannon

I almost had a heart attack in the first 3 minutes

Remember when Pewds&#39; biggest concern in Minecraft was buying Gucci pants off a villager?

ok pewds to be honest u did that fire thing right ?? i know

the funny thing is, although his house is on fire, he aint even sprinting

PewDiePie: Anytime a creeper blows something up Ingvar will payCreepers that hate Ingvar

Nice start

Anyone else watching this video on 3fps

2 30sec flying fifhing rod

Pewds look at Bblocks elevator tutorial

KARMA IS REAL

But wow that he builded is like one of a kind

Why don&#39; he build the thing that throws lava my brother can build it

What to the villagers in water sheep’s face

it was badder than notre dame and more terryfieng than 911 or ww2

<a href="">6:17</a> looks like someone went creative mode again..

I saw disaster and really wanted a fire bc it looked like Sven would dies

Is it true he has 2 stacks of obsidian and a stack of pistons

Sven will never die wanna know why?He is in creative.

Pewds: does big brain redstone elevator in survival modeMe: I cAnt eVEn d0 tHat iN crEatIVe

Why did i saw a fliyng fishrod  water sheep nooooooooooo

THE TREE OF LIFE HAS BEEN DESTROYED NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<a href="">9:28</a> (for me)

Why I can&#39;t see your health

I don’t know when or how but this became a red stone chanel

Juice died this day

he might be more dramatic then me....

(ㅠ.ㅜ)

Way has cheken and  fire

I liked better when just simple things made him so happy like the time he found sven :( or when his house was just a little cabin

Pewds so rich he uses slime blocks instead of dirt <a href="">12:30</a>

Nooooooo

Attack on Creeper

I think why your house almost burnt down in Minecraft because of the imported honey blocks from the last episode

The Vìdeo crashed

Hi

There is a fishing rod in <a href="">2:30</a>

Poopdle

he do be in creative mode doe

the feels tho, it happened to me one time. burned my house. 

It almost seems like he purposely wanted Sven to be blown up

felix:we need a defence.4lso felix:has a dirt wall.

Was the fire staged? He wasn&#39;t taking any damage, and if he had fire resistance then he would&#39;ve also known there was gonna be a fire.I mean, ig he wouldn&#39;t stage something that would destroy his house, but idk.

How does felix know these things

can someone explain how to make pewdiepies elevator or pewdiepie pls give me tutorial for the elevator cuz i tried making it it wont work everything just goes super fast the block doesnt go up idk if im stupid but i listend to pewds the observ and stuff

it reminds me of i torcher Jerry

Anyone else just binge watching his Minecraft vids on a playlist lol.

He could just open the old saved file instead of rebuilding it. Lol

Who saw that fishing rod flying?

when the villager said :oa a o oi oa a oa oi ,  i felt that

Y

I got a nametag for Felix. Mumbo#2

Need more in 2020

I should say Pewdiepie is so damn creative!!!

Plz give your world download link

Even pewd&#39;s PC lags due to the fire. Minecraft do something 

That’s so sad he said he just finished the interior and it got on fire

Joergen in so happy

&quot;This is a message to all creepers watching this video&quot;The creepers: 

Anyone saw that when he was burning he didn&#39;t take any damage

pewdiepie: i made an oopsie in minecraft but i will never do it again, pewdiepie promisealso pewdiepie: brakes a redstone comparator with a chiken by just touching it and covers his hearts as he did in the oopsie episode

<a href="">7:26</a> is he on creative mode?

I got sardines when Sven got on fire but I glad Sven didn’t die.

<a href="">0:44</a> He’s on fire but not taking damage?????

I found a PewDiePie phone case advert right when I clicked your vid XD

Do you remember feigi stolid person

this series used to be A guy trying to get sheep in his pen, remember.

who ever does this makes felix sad and quit

pewds i have never seen bigger bags under your eyes, im pretty sure i could shop at a mall and still come out with half a bag

I love the app and the new version has been a good way of keeping my brain on my own mind to get the app and the app I have for the app and I have been able for more years now I can not recommend this game for my friends to my own app I have to buy a few of them but it won’t be a great app for my iPhone to get my money and it is still not worth the time of my time with it and it has been

<a href="">2:31</a> a floating carrot on a stick

I cry

New idea: pet totem.   Bind it to your pet and when they die use the totem to bring them back

That was DEEEP not Sven

I remember this day :(

Its obvious that he used creative mode in this episode

Do you copy the world

No inventory showing

My house bernt down but all my pets died

The lesson learnt?Every house has to have emergency procedures and fire extinguishers located throughout, even in minecraft

To be honest. Pewdiepie is grian and mumbo combined.

i can&#39;t find the link to his gofundme

use carpet

<a href="">2:30</a> we all saw that

Felix is cheating <a href="">6:43</a> when he jumps down and lands he takes no fall damage

IKEA tower reminds me when i built a castle in my survival world and my dog fell of and died... CRY EMOJI

This was the day before everything went wrong...

ur minecraft game is lagging

Sven: <b>doesn’t take damage at all</b>Pewds: SVEN EAT!

I dont remember this episode

im so confused. sven was blown up by tnt 2 episodes ago

For some reason I saw two adds of the worst game<b>raid shadow legends</b>

Remember don&#39;t put wood in the nearest lava so the Japanese house will not burn

Where is Ulla Britta? Flip Flop And Villagers???

That eliveter is simple he says

i’m rewatching this series and don’t know why i feel bad for felix he looks so tired from all the hard work he has done in minecraft 

Pewds: breaking red stone block with fist

This went from a sheep in water to burning dog,hell dog,giant meatball,sheep council,housefires,cat abuse,human trafficking,rape,child murder,and incest

A tree

<a href="">8:14</a>What Is Watersheep Doing There?

What am I even watching at this point

Hey pewds can you do /kill @e plz it helps get rid of lag

Red stone elevatorPewdiepie: This is very simple.Me: Sliiiiiiiiiime and redstone and something and something.

I see the fishing rod floating at <a href="">2:31</a> Sorry for late comment‍️

f

imagine how different this series would be without a sheep getting stuck in water or pewdiepie’s audience saying That he can go in the nether with joergen.

I think herobrine did it

Minecraft&#39;s real life firefighter

Question: why did he not take any burn damage?

Pewdiepie never says good morning gammers

Ожидаем!)))))

Hiiiiiiiiiiiii

<a href="">5:25</a> this would be pretty simple 2 sec laterHe shows that

<a href="">2:31</a> theres a flying fishing rod

Anyone see the floating fishing rod? at <a href="">2:30</a>

<a href="">0:15</a> The lucky chicken

I appreciate pewd explaining everything but that doesnt change the fact that i dont understand a thing

pewds you are funny

His hair sticking up out of his headphones! 

Bro I made a real gun by putting repeater on dispenser with arrows in it this guy takes hours of fails just a TNT launcher ready but good work you did it you don&#39;t have to do it again problem solved problem solved we solve the problem now everything is awesome problem solved

Just make a dipenser

The real Chernobyl

Felix to chickens: Come out my children!Also Felix: Eats cooked chicken

add a fire Alarm!

FELLOW FLIOR GANG THIS IS URGENT MR BEAST THREATINED PEWDIEPIE WE SHALL BATTLE

Now just imagine of he didn&#39;t want to separate his sheep so he could dye them so he could make blue and yellow wool. Everyone was saying, imagine if the sheep didn&#39;t get stuck in the water. No, imagine, he didn&#39;t dye his sheep.

When he is building the gun outside of the wall you can seee a sheep face building what is that

Wean  he  klli

Sven  I  get  happy

Are ya winning son?

E

Your haiiiirrrrrr!!!!!!!!

I prefer his old house cause he used it and it’s space more

He lost his own damn camera, i love this man

A normal Minecraft series to a strait up role play

He could’ve just turned fire spreads off

Creeper watching: Lets kill watership

Where’s bengt

So thats how Caves are Made .

how does he have so much slime

pewdiepie: ahh my house is burningme:[shouting] get water idiot

What he’s still using gold boots

I don’t think this is how the game was meant to be played.

Pewds: I need someone to pay.Pewds of the past: In the old days we used to just torture a random sheep or chicken.

Any one notice he is on fire and he isn’t dying

<a href="">7:26</a> he&#39;s in creative because he broke the block instantly

Did anyone see the add at the end???

He doesnt even get damaged anymore

Tidying my room

Felix: everyone i love dies ;-;Marzia: chuckles im in danger

When he went through the 2h transition, hos hp and hunger didn&#39;t change... He went into creative

Some won prank you. Because I saw a fishing rod in the air

im enderman not creeper ok trodde du att jag skulle vara en creeper   )=&lt;          )=&lt;

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo o have a minecraft in computer no

Pewdiepie should bring a friend here and tell him/her to stand somewhere where the tnt goes then launch the tnt that would be so funny

The dislikes are from creepers.

I&#39;ve been playing Minecraft longer than him and I don&#39;t know how to make the things he makes

,

hi pewdiepie i wish you read this

<b>shickens</b>

What the name of the intro song ?

It’s funny when he says epic

I watched your whole minecraft series 2 times in 1 day

I still don&#39;t understand about the water sheep.. I watched a few of previous video, include the death of water sheep..Btw i&#39;m A new subscriber here

Real life: House on fire: WE NED WATERminecraft: Use Axe

<a href="">2:30</a> there was a flying fishing rod or someone holding the fishing rod

PewDiePie not burning he cheat hahahaha

F

Suhhjjhhhhhhhhhhgbbgvgvgvgvgvgvgvgv*vgvg

Indonesia

This is the best!!

You have a stack of obsidian

What happened to the ranch

Hi I&#39;m here for the first time I like his reaction to such things not and he is sensitive to the syenduuk

Does anyone know the name of the opening music because the music sounds so good. I also can&#39;t believe that this series started with a tiny house with one the most famous trees inside it.

<a href="">11:52</a> CHEATA! dat very random? Me think no. (Invetory)

You are  poopy

I’m a creeper!!!

<a href="">1:59</a>

PewDiePie. welcome back to a beautiful day in mindcraft  HOLY FRICK WHAT HAPPEND

Anyone wonder how Felix didn&#39;t die or burn from the fire?

Have a happy bro fist bros

I legit screamed when sven caught fire...

What will happen when Mumbo Jumbo finds out someone else is doing redstone?

When you make a super big house but you don&#39;t know what to put in &quot;Suffering From Success&quot;

Vc use creative si!!

When your house catches on fire in Minecraft, it&#39;s legit one of the most frustrating things ever. With the lava in Felix&#39;s basement, I honestly can&#39;t believe it took this long for it to happen. And I&#39;m also surprised he just covered his basement up with his new house instead of filling it in.Double Fs in the chat for his Minecraft house.

See how Felix kept two hours later template and said it took a day. Maybe a Minecraft day or not

The legend says it all start by punching trees

Well I&#39;m a sven

Wait. Whatever happens to Sven after ingvar escapes?

Hahaha não tem tradução para br

did anyone saw floating carrot on the stick floating on air? I did

Hang on if this is click bait again I&#39;m gonna be mad

He looks like ferb with his hair up

pewds: i will not cheat again that is a pewdiepie promisealso pewdiepie: /give username Minecraft:honey_block 10then in the later episode he said that he does not know how to make a honey block

Wait did Sven die??!!

Subscripe Sarkar 33

Why he not burning tho 

U should do a bubble elevator 

The ghost of Watersheep came to destroy Felix.

._. ._. ._. ._. ._. ._.

i wish watersheep was here and i wish that Felix did not hate watersheep

/donat

This is the END!!!

I felt so bad for Felix! All his hard work with redatone...

I will kill sven revenged wht you did in my house

When did he get so much slime!?

Water bucket: I&#39;m waiting to call

Pewdiefly Inc. “Sending IKEA towers to space for over 25 years.

I think PewDiePie is cheating look here there is a floating carrot on a stick pretty suspicious <a href="">2:31</a>

his real house floods, and his minecraft house gets burned down. F

EEEAAATTTTTTT SVEENNNNNN EAAATTTT SVEEN

I have an idea to ingvar you need ulla britta to ingvar because creepers are scared of catsLEAVE A LIKE SO PEWDIEPIE WILL DO IT

Pewdiepie try cats creepers are afraid of cats

Epic

Felix hates him self at this point

It&#39;s like Alfred and batman

I feel disgusted the tree of life isnt there i i- can&#39;t ...

<a href="">2:35</a> look at pewdiepie

I want PewDiePie to get 1 billion subs. I vote to PewDiePie.

Where&#39;s the disaster?

sd

Dude i tried building my bff a jacuzzi and. I used lava in it and i burnt her house down to the ground(in Minecraft) she spent like half an hour on it and it was a treehouse i-she hasnt seen it yet and i cant build it back its too hard advice anyone?

Haha

The mental lag is brutal

Pewdiepie : welcome it is a beautiful day in minecraft Lava : imma end this man whole career <b>burning his house</b>

Water sheep angry.

Instead of building a gun couldn’t he have just gotten a normal bow and shot the chicken

SVEN!!!

Council of water sheep is the kid of water sheep

Did the house get struck by lightning

Imagine if Felix actually turned fire spreads off

Pewdp your game tuber simulater is very good but it is related to date and time of mobile so when we change time of tge mobile the game changes too so we don&#39;t need to spend our money to skip or play Gobble and Poggle and the game doesn&#39;t understand that we cheated.

Someone is invisible at <a href="">2:31</a>

Channel your inner water sheep

<a href="">7:10</a> anakin and the younglings

Does anybody know the music in the intro?

Everything has its roots

Anytime Sven gets hurt:pewdiepie: EAT CHICKEN!!!!!!!!!!shoves chicken in Svens mouth

he cheated he was on same hunger before and after <a href="">3:25</a>

OMG well pewdiepie

<a href="">2:30</a> there is a item flotinng

Dinnerbone forgotten bengt forgotten ulla Brita forgotten

Ingvar was probably the longest living creeper in Minecraft history

Felix:*ikea tower and frock chamber farm meatball 2 Japanese houses but not a simple house

You can download a mod or addon to get guns in minecraft

A human could die, I don&#39;t give two sheets. If an animal dies, I will fricking sacrifice myself to the council of the dogs

Umm i dont think he made a gun its more like a automatic mining thing haha anyone agree?

<a href="">5:33</a> you could&#39;ve just searched how to build an elevator in minecraft. That&#39;s what I did and it&#39;s simple.

Pewds: <b>builds a complicated contraption</b>Also pewds: The way it works, it;s very simple.

What was up with Felix&#39;s hair in <a href="">4:08</a>

“This is a message to all creepers watching out there”My creeper plushie watching with me: O-O

Pepepopo

Killing the water sheep boss did this

When ever I’m sad I watch pewdiepie I cried 6 time today and all I wanted to do is watch this

Moral of the story:Never kill chickens....They could set your house on fire .-.

maybe the lightning thing struck ur house!

This is prestons worst fear xD

Stap creeper abuse 

Pewds must have a Civil engineering degree

Just bought the pewdiepie g fuel and used code pewdiepie

It all started going downhill after Svens bf died

<a href="">1:02</a> coronavirus be like

<a href="">1:02</a> coronavirus be like

The villager is right

Don’t keep lava in a wooden house

<a href="">4:45</a> he cut the time the creeper would have exploded...

You are the most subscribed channel Pewdiepie

The house fire gave me flash backs from the Australian Bushfires

<a href="">2:30</a> anyone else see that floating in the air?

Pewds hair tho <a href="">4:13</a>

Did, anyone else notice the green dog was there not sven

I don&#39;t know about you but I can actually understand what these animals say

<b>These videos are so sad now that I know Sven fricks his own son later on...</b>

Me: Why the elevator so complicated?Pewdiepie: The way this works is very simple.Me: Nani?

<a href="">4:43</a> I&#39;m sorry what happened to the mic

House burning downJack black be like: I swear I didnt do it this time!

Nice hair

Me: can barely make a redstonne doorPewdiepie: Simple redstone contraption

WHY NO JUSTICE FOR JEB_

Que bueno como arde el perro puto team rubius

Why wasn&#39;t he taking any health when he was on fire, he wasn&#39;t even losing half a heart?

Lol  bad base

and apparently pewds is now mumbo jumbo level redstone

the fps tho lmao

<b>When PewDiePie knows more about redstone than Grian</b>

just call the fire police

<a href="">2:30</a> look to the right carrot on a stick hmmmm

Nonono you all got it wrongEverything started because we complained to him about him playing no games. There for gaming week happened

I would honestly rage quit and like stop playing for like a month

<a href="">8:51</a> felix look like dr strange from Avenger

Pewds: <b>houses burns down</b> I will never financially recover from this

Pewdiepie: I like to abuse creepers.PEDA: is that an opportunity?

This is very important! you need to kill the chickens that are in the cage with ingvar. If too many mobs are crammed into one block they will suffocate, so the chickens might suffocate ingvar the creeper.

Is it just me or in this video does Felix look like Doctor Strange?

Pewdiepie:using a axe wile trying to put out fire so he breaks his house Big brain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why do he has fire damage off??

After he says it makes not sense and when he jump down there was a fishing rode floating

Ok if this happens again this is what you do:-take a minute to assess the situation -there is a setting so that fire won’t spread, turn it on-grab water/ice and put out the fire

not nice video quality

Pewdiepie: Where are all the chickens?Later: STARTS KILLING ALL THE CHICKENS.

<a href="">11:49</a> I just noticed, Felix has a stack of sticky piston and a stack of obsidian, I feel betrayed

<a href="">7:44</a> the chickens fangirl over a creeper

한국인들 손!!!@

What happened to the villager thing

this dude is crazy. imma cry rn cause i can&#39;t even build a freaking house while this dude find so easy to build an elevator and such.

Felix: Gotta put out the fire! My entire building is burning down!Sven: <b>takes damage</b>Felix: SVEEEEEEEEEN

Felix: this is a message to all the creepers watchingMe: phew....................... (questions life identity)

Epic

the great flames of the japanese library of alexandria

The whole building burning:EVERYTHING BURNING:Pewdiepie: GO SVEN EAT A CHICKEN

<a href="">3:35</a> music?

Pewds: Today is a Beautiful day * a moment later pewds house is on fire*

Felix: GoodMorning Gamers!!<b>Meanwhile later</b>Also Felix: How did this happen?!!!

PEWDS: made the IKEA tower float into the space, made a freakin simulator, talked to the beetroots, made a tnt tower. MOJANG: we need more help.

Omg piewdiepie

Your hair is like standing up

This is worse than the library of Alexandria burning down

The first five mins if this episode took him a whole day 

Why is there a floating pen fishing pole at the time <a href="">2:41</a>

Australia

you know pewdiepie a friend kristian ph and go to your house and fire because MChero

Did anyone else notice the random wood when he was throwing boombs

<a href="">10:41</a>

.

How did he start by trying to frick ingvar to torturing him

imagine if pewds played animal crossing. i fear for the safety of his villagers.

Pewdiepie the red stone god

You can put a dispenser so that it will shoot tnt like a machine gun

Pewdiepie making a bad tnt cannon and calling it a gun is pretty hilarious

Wait a minute PewDiePie why will creepers pay

I’d like to think that he gathered and built everything in survival but..... idk

What is Minecraft seed

anybody else realize that this vid was posted when Juice died

<a href="">3:10</a> but how

Why didn&#39;t he take fire damage?

I had a dream of this

1e:50 those are different world !! That means that he shouldn&#39;t be here then that means you cheated ! Or got another villager!

<a href="">0:35</a> that was proply lightning! Unlucky!

Who else wants to see him play scrap mechanic?

Are we going to ignore the amount of wood he has stacked on top of eachothdr

He has become so good at redstone that it looks like mumbo jumbo

Last ep: people always say I look like sh*t after long minectaft days After building the house for 2 hours: looks like he wants to die

Pewdiepie:wood does not burn very wellMean while in Australia California and Amazon rain Forrest: Ahhh it burns

Every video Pewds frames get worse and worse

You can have hidden lights by hiding glowstone or torches under a piece of half slab replacing the floor in case u don&#39;t like all the torches around the room

ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개웃기네

At <a href="">2:30</a> there is a floating carrot on a stick maybe there is an invisable entity whitch set ur house on fire PewDiePie!!

I have Minecraft
