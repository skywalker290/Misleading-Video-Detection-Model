here she looks so good. the lips don&#39;t look too big and the eyebrows don&#39;t look weird either

How fake do you want me to be? : YES

Since you are veg for a day or two, Try Assamese Bamboo pork. All work out will go for a toss 😊

she is being honest atleast

Can anyone tell me which lip shade is she wearing?

All fake.
Good diet. Eat breakfast properly 👍❤️
Something you can cook?: Readymade Nachos with cheese topping

I literally do all things she does! 🆙🆙🆙🆙🇮🇳✳️🌀🤕
She trying to be Kylie Jenner.....😅 Her body language is so similar with kylie

Arey she thinks we are dumb . She is indeed dumb. All lies.

Pehle bolna seekho ,diction saaf karo,itraoooo mat
Learn from your mother, learn acting, not drama.
finally a good relatable celeb 😍😂

Jhanvi is beautiful like her mother.

All lies

The best thing is that everything they tell is lies..👍

I tuned Veg , But today I had Fish Though ,

She eat and do exercise every one is just on diet

<a href="">0:22</a> She just learnt a menu...😂😂❤

<a href="">0:13</a> Beast was hilarious...🤣🤣

I am not interested in what you eat actually...

The rest. All the things are true in English such as Farrate Daar Se Sikhe Bencho Yeh To Sal 7 Din Me Learn Wale H
I really like the fact that she eats well. But nachos and cheese killed it! I can also make amazing bread butter ☺️ 🤣

Very good beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Beautiful friend ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Everyone is now glutin free

Lies lies lies
“I can make nachos “😂😂😂
“I recently turned veg .. today i had fish though “- hypocrisy at it’s height 😂😂

The real struggler

I am making a comment
Nacho and cheese is cooking 🤣🤣

Who cares what she eats . <b>She was party to killing  her own  mother</b> and now sitting smug ! Dangerous woman

She is now so fat

Someone honest enough to accept that they eat.. wow..! Also someone who’s all answers were not ‘ghar ka khaana’ although she actually eats ghar ka hi khaana 😅😅

Glad your Vegetarian, Become Vegan.
My crush jhanvi choklet ♥️
More vedios with her 💗💗💗
I clicked the video. Paused it at 0 seconds. Just to comment.Who the fuck cares what you eat, get a life !

This is the only person who spoke about ghee, parathas, sweet potato, ragi and the like stuff like us, normal people. Finally🙄

&quot;I recently turned veg...today i had fish though..&quot; ..Wait what :D :D

She eats a lot but doesn&#39;t gain weight

Who cares so sick of nepotism and star kids with absolutely zero looks and zero talent

So beautiful janhvi kapoor

Gujarati Dal
Looks like rashmika mandana
Pinkvilla you should interview Neetu Kapoor

I ŕecently turned veg....today I had fish tough.

Just think these kids have all money and food in the world and cannot ate anything ... haha

Talks about parathas and more parathas then says &quot;Gluten my body doesn&#39;t digest it well&quot; &quot;Upping my carbs for energy&quot; Girl what? You digesting the gluten in those parathas and the rest of them carbs just fine it seems like 🙃

&quot;Recently turned veg...today I had fish though&quot; So folks looks like it&#39;s not working out like we thought 😂

Probably not true.

My favourite dish beef curry 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋

🥺🥺🥺 love you mam
Lolzzzzz she eats basically paratha , rest around it 😂

Happiness homestoo

Iski ma sridevi dekhne me kitne sundor thi er aya bakwas hey looking me....she is hot but not beautiful...iske face achhe nahi hay..iska bahen isse jada sundor hay...usko film me ana chayiye thi..

Shes a blessed soul..

i love you from samarth

Lesson from her life is maya, maya hein aur bhagwan ka prasad, prasad hein. Jhatka lesson  this was, she took good name and no opulence and no children with her and could not become a vaishnavi to break the mould. So do no monkeying please. Read mother teresa properly from come be my light book and then know her properly and follow srila prabhupad with his disciple gaur govinda swamy otherwise iskcon people are a lot trouble nowadays. AND CHANT HARE KRSNA AND BE HAPPY. Serve devotees and save devotees and save yourselves.  I feel god made best lesson out of good person Sriji or Sriji herself thought great for herself and humankind and gods people, The Vaishnavas. GOD BLESS HER AND HER PEOPLE.

Not casino devi. Its Vaisno   Devi and innocent bhakta tukarams wife.

I have never felt her mother gone. But do feel empty. It was as if a truly lessony filmy episode. It still feels unbelievable. It feels like a film. But where is Sriji? Hiding? Miss mam though strongly and piously just as she was. News was terribly bad. Felt bad. But Sriji is still there I feel to break the mayavi mould like mother india and like meera and like casino devi to break the mayavi mould. She could I felt. She exudes truthfulness. She was cool without a nose job too. People drive children crazy. She was such sportive childlike person. Great great actress whose life self thoughtfully has become a great great lesson to break the mould.  Such is her determination. Hasn&#39;t she served lord krsna through her profession although she was almost forced into it. I  Love her persona a lot. God, Krsna severely bless her family becos Sriji wants it. She in a little way is a goddess like. That&#39;s Indian culture people, expected result.  😍😓😢👌🙏

Grow up. Literally. Hope she is. Her mother is a great lesson to all who couldn&#39;t break the mould but was a lot earthly pious. But jhanvi must try to break the maya nagari mould and her mother and she herself will be the first person to be happy about it. And everybody too. We will remember Sriji strongly with prayers.

Recently I turned veg but today I had fish 😒 meanwhile vegetarians ; Abey saali🤣

So they won&#39;t actually tell us what they really eat in a day!

We asked what do you eat where people eat 😝😝😝Ghaass you eat
Cheese nachos 🤣 what&#39;s there to prepare in that 🤣

i love the way she is presenting her lifestyle..in this vedio..

cutieeee....😏😏😏

I really like you

Please make what&#39;s on your bag

even i turn veg everyday until non veg turns at mefinally someone who said what she eats unlike people just saying one or two stuffs rest they will say a light dinner what to they mean by light only water god knows

Best foods for weight loss- hot lemon water, brown rice, wheat, jeera water, pumpkin, curd, millets,  butter milk, chia seeds, coconut water, herbal teas, almonds, 3 litres water etc...❤️

This is the titty...,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣
MUJHE JHANVI KAPOOR KI ACTING BILKUL PASAND NAHI HAI..... 🙄🙄🙄

She is obviously got a good metabolism or she&#39;s talking shit. Not all of us here can throw the low carb thing out of window 🤣

Chal jhoothee!

Nobody cares what u eat in a day jhanvi

You looks so plastic

Happiness family to sisters

Janhvi is my favourite actress after Sridevi ma&#39;am, Madhuri ma&#39;am &amp; Kajol ma&#39;am.. 🥰😍

She said really truth , because other say like continental,  Thai

Would love to see her skin care routine. She has such a beautiful skin.

she is lying, not a blessed soul, she was overly overweight as a kid.... disappointing interview

Alia Bhatt suddenly started sounding like Einstein to me after listening to Jahnvi

Yes, I eat parantha but I don't eat gluten. And my cooking wah wah 🤣🤣🤣
How much do you eat, what is the meaning of the logo, why are you eating it?
Liar.
she is a blessed soul who eats a lot n still remain the same? lyk seriously 😆😆 plzz look at her older photographs first

She Is beautiful and gorgeous

Dinner I keep light, I have red rice briyani 🙊🙊😂😂🤣

She is so sweet

𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝟭𝟬𝟬 𝗸𝗿𝘃𝗮 𝗱𝗼 𝗽𝗹𝘇🙏
Parathas are usually made of wheat...and wheat is gluten..and she said she can&#39;t digest gluten..so hw cm gluten is taken care off😂😂.. sounds scripted which clearly went wrong

I think she is a normal human like us😋

Behan India main bhi nachos milte hain 😒
You can have gluten allergy

what can you cook??  Nacho and cheeseMaggi bhi bol deti or boiled water 😂😂

I also looove chocolates and ice creams

Recently turned veg n today she had fish !

This is just some bunch of lies

Janhvi kapoor I stay in ivory heights your house is front of my house I am 9 years old my name is asbah I wanna meet you

Literally she used to tell all the ans. Before the questions being complete😅

She likes to keep dinner lite but eats red rice biryani 😂

I love her

&quot;I make really good nachos and cheese, I put nachos and cheese in microwave&quot;

Day or week?

I guess, she is one of the few actresses who actually told what she eats without too much &quot;adaaaiyen&quot;...!!

She is beautiful

Janvi you are so beautifull

Somehow, jhanvi is so relatable to all of us... nothing fake, nothing to brag about...

fake interview

Thank god she eat everything

Liar liar pants on fire 🔥
I liked how she was confused with her answers i love her

Thank god.. who is this.. who eats human food?
I really appreciate her eating habits because I can relate her hehe. But keep in mind she does exercises too which I don&#39;t 😑And that is what the difference 🙄😞🥴

Ans is as simple as that =DRUGS

Stop pretending Jhanvi.
Parathas all day and try to avoid gluten ? 😂 She&#39;s a real cutie❤️

Biryani...lite?
she dont look like celebrity

.........apart from plastic.

Is she a celebrity?lol

This new star kids talk like they have worked a lot already. When asked about diet chart or in bag segment etc. they will always so depend on their work shoot, what time their shooting schedule is blah blah blah...especially Ananya and Janhvi do it quite often, however Janhvi is a little better than Ananya in some cases, meanwhile Ananya is genuinely cringeworth!

She got that 22 yr old metabolism

I recently turned veg today I had fish though. Nepo bimbo

With alia bhatt

I recently turned veg though......I had fish today.

She&#39;s so pretty 😻 and like honest I mean

Wow 🤩

WHY you are quiet on you mother&#39;s murder???????

Sorry I don&#39;t feel she is telling truth it&#39;s only to please pplzz😁😁

Cutiee..she&#39;s so humble no attitude.  Ananya 👎
Last meal before 10 wow.

Even after so many surgeries she has such an ugly face lol

Hii janhvi I love you 😘
What haircut she applied ??

Finally someone is answering quickly to all the questions😑 meanwhile  others in the industry answering like &quot; one eternity later&quot;😂as if they are cooking up😬 .She seems to be genuine and crystal clear about what she really eats😌

Jhanvi=likeAnanya=comment
She didn&#39;t mentioned her Father&#39;s 💰.

Honest
Pretty rich people problems

Jahnvi is sooper gorgeous and being simple..she is awesome like her mom❤️

I recently turned veg Today i had fish tho💀

Like other celebrities she doesn&#39;t says that I have vegetable she actually taken the name bhindi that tell us she&#39;s a golden heart person

.

i hate hate her voice
When did you take ganja?
What did she said at 00.56 min

God bless Janhvi! She doesn&#39;t deserve so much trolls and hatred.

She has wore same dress like shraddha ( what shraddha eats in a day) vedio shraddha wore same dress

You are a sweet kid Janhavi and definitely a good actor, out of all the new crop like silly Ananya Pandey. Keep up the good work, and don&#39;t let critisim faze you. God bless! You were awesome as Gunjan Saxena, your mom must be so proud!!!

Have you guys watched Gunjan Saxena. She was acting soo well there. Please don&#39;t spread hate for janvhi. Love you janvhi 😍

Well I have a crush on this girl ,she is really kinda sweet ❤️

Last meal before 10?!😂😱 that’s bad actually..but I like her honesty!😊

So Honest Janhvi Dee...😍😍
So what can we do wht u eat in a day..nepo kids

Hum toh chuttiye hain

I vomited when I saw this dung.
She is just a nepo kid who have done several surgeries and now giving gynaan about natural beauty BOYCOTT STARKID

After watching her acting skills i fell my pet have good expresions and acting skills

Boycott her useless nepo product

Well she cooks nachos wid cheese ,how? Buy nachos, buy cheese n then put them is microwave together is her cooking🤐

Yogii❤❤❤
What was this interview So spoke so much contradictory things You sounded dumber than aalia

Okay so basically there is no such rule for actresses as to starve themselves and keeping their cravings unfulfilled 😜

jahnvi and shraddha are the only humble star kids

The favr8 dish of starkids-opportunities of talented folks!🤣😂

She is not over acting

damn cute girl
Boycott.... this Nepo kids having no talent

Very honest and down to earth  Janhvi.

Wat u eat plz tell so we can avoid so to avoid contagious dumbness of these nepo kids

U

Did she say she turned vegetarian and then she had a fish 🤣babe you need some real knowledge

This is the most honest interview not like ananya panday🤣

I recently turned veg and had fish in the afternoon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You eat throughout the day. Okay. Now please tell us, how many times you excreate ?

Why these starkids work so hard to prove they are dumb lol

Mad o wat

The maid of my house has said this better.
Sweet

You tailanted don&#39;t take care

Jaanu you are gorgeous

Nepotism

She is very beautiful ❤️❤️.
She looks exactly like Anannya Pandey... jondis patients

she&#39;s in an entertainment industry, movies me heroine banke a rhi h vo, director producer nhi h vo Hoti to nhi bolti but she&#39;s too ugly to be an actress!!! And everyone says the same agr sridevi ki beti nhi Hoti to side role b nhi milta!!!!! Rhea janhvi ki bhen she&#39;s also not that attractive so she&#39;s changed her field and became a producer so as ekta!!! It&#39;s not necessary, just because you&#39;re superstar born, you should try in acting only!!! There are many failed examples Esha deol, Abhishek, Tushar, even Abhishek changed his field! I it&#39;s not necessary that your favourite superstar&#39;s children are also talented and we should adore them unnecessarily and blindly. Even I totally adore srk, but doesn&#39;t mean I should say that suhana got featured in vogue India was a great decision, it wasn&#39;t!!! Being a super star&#39;s child is not an achievement! Period!

😂😂😂Shara nice
Love u Jhanvi ❤️
I love this beautiful girl, she has so much potential, much much better actor then Saran and Ananya.

Wow such nepotistic strugglers, making nachos sounds worse than making maggie🙄🙄

no restaurant dish can ever beat <b>bhindi ki sabji</b> by mom💜

Her acting skills just suck.  She is the true definition of nepotism.

Guyss i know turning vege means no meat but catholics are vege on fridays but are àllowed to eat fish

I love that she keeps herself real

i wish there were more video with Jhanvi

I think we should stop trolling her.She is nice

She is gorgeous ....

NYC 🥰
what a freaking liar hahahhaha

she’s lying so hard omg. i saw a video where she was offered cake by katrina and janvi refused it because she doesn’t goof up her diet

Sridevi was the best....But she is not that famous as Sridevi was....I think Janhvi has got a lot of attitude

Hi

5 minutes she completed her eating habits 😂😂😂Go n see shilpa shetty 😂

Janhvi kapoor is the prettiest actress I have ever seen !!!!!!

Hey ! Checkout my page for Jahnvi Kapoor looks recreate !!

Finally, there is someone who eats in bollywood...I love you janvi , you eat gujrati daal , paratha .like I never thought of it. Anyone here  to time pass during lockdown

she so real ,she is so inspiring , we want more videos with her

I found sara and janvi genuine here...but i like sara more she has a charm..😊

Wow didi , itna kuch ,salam to your workout

Best things she has revealed

She is faking

Before I was not liking janvi...i was liking sara but after sara Ali Khan&#39;s acting..I gave up..janvi is d best because she has that grace and acting skills

Ahhh when you are young enough, and your metabolism hasn’t slowed down yet!

When I see jhanvi:ooo let&#39;s check her diet and she will have a serious diet😊😊😊Jhanvi:ok iam a blessed soukMe:😆😆😆🤨🤨😣😣😣😣😣😣
She is simple and cute

Her mom also likes icecream

I expected idly sambar dosa 😛😛😛
She knows to make nachos with cheese :)

Imagine being handed everything on a platter. Your career, fame, even your appearance via surgeries.

Though short but really inter video 😍😍

No acting talents....
She is sweet..

Her:I recently turned veg..... Me: oh that&#39;s good 👏👏Her:Today I had fish though Me : o bhai mujhe maro.. Maro mujhe maro yeh mazak ho rha hain... 😂

I just love the way she talks

1.36 upping my carb?  There&#39;s no word as upping

liars...dont expect actresses to tell the truth

my dream
Okay her body can&#39;t digest gluten and she keeps saying parathas, is she for real or is she that dumb?? 🙄

She is so cute!!

Granny 😢
Nachos really? Wow ya congrats u know to make nachos.. not even dal atleast..?

2000 times better than Ananya Pandey

WTF IS UPING????anyone noticed💁👉👀👂
I always like this gal ..and dude she just eats every thing ..

Janvi...try diffrnt hair styles lik sonam janvii...u vud look fab in dose..js a midle parted plain hair..z not dat cool every tym bae..js a suggestn..😊

Never judge a book by its cover.🥀

Nobody :Literally Nobody :JHANVI KAPOOR : Recently I turned vegan. In afternoon I ate fish though<b>le me</b> : Ni Ye Mazaak Chal Raha Hai. Oo Bhai Maaro Muje Maaro

Such a innocent pure hearted girl ❤

Dinner she keeps lite - chicken biryani !! Last meal she eats early - 10pm 🤔

This girl drinks dumb fuck juice

She is actually good girl..

She is so sweet 😍

Jahnvi: I recently turned vegAlso Jahnvi: I had fish this afternoon😂😂 Jahnvi hilarious

You have the most beautiful soothing voice!

cute girl❤️❤️
I’m so sure that she doesn’t eat this everyday and manage to stay fit!! She just described her cheat meal day!! 😬

She&#39;s a true punjabi!

Sab jhud, stop acting
U eat pickles

Hi

I wish she acts in a south Indian movie.

Your face is like a frog !!!!!!!Get a nepotism tatto on u !!!!!!Sridevi ke vaje SE ek film mile Varna tu to # tatti face he !!!!!!!!!!!

She eats like a beast

Hard work pays off!

gluten intolerant but keep eating parathas in breakfast and lunch ......lol

She is better than Sara for sure❤ so damn genuine

Don&#39;t think that jhanvi is lucky enough to eat everything such as nachos and Briyani and looks great. We as a viewer can get to know who is real or fake. She really does workout and eat healthy. Not like icecream nachos. Don&#39;t need to put curtain in our eyes. Even Katrina Kaif Adriana Lima and Aishwarya is not lucky enough to eat anything junky and look beautiful

half punjabi, half south indian, basically the best foods of india. She must have a hard time eating less!!!!!

Janvi 💟💟
Sara😍❤️❤️
I like her voice very much
Jhanvi❤️❤️
Why you talk lies like a politician....

Brother, since when has this fish grown?
Breakfast : nepotism tablet,  lunch: nepotism injection  , dinner : nepotism tonic
What the F. She eats paratha whole day and her body can’t take Gluten. @pinkvilla pleaaaaase take interviews of celebrities who are actually honest because people look up to these interviews.

With Katrina, deepika, anushka😍

You don&#39;t need to be veggie or have a carb free diet to have a healthy routine.. What refresh your body and mind should be eaten but obviously in a right proportion... Grabbing all the foods in a couple of minute should result in a bad way....carbs,protein,minerals, vitamins should present in your meal in a right proportion so that your body and mind can act and respond correctly...having a keto diet or eating only water day after day is nothing but torturing your body....stay healthy,stay fit and eat in right proportion,maintain the times of having food,take a good exercise or physical activities...That&#39;s it ☺

She is so honest n down to earth . Her reply to each n every question was very honest

She ate fish ... disgusting to watch her

Direct answers..no blabbering and overacting like other actresses.👍💕

Putting cheese on nachos is not cooking

It&#39;s ok to cheat on your veg diet once in a while. I do it too bcoz I turned veg recently like her. But sometimes the craving is so strong that you have to have smthng to kill it. Like Hrithik Roshan says, &#39;no dieting works without a cheat meal&#39;. So, good luck to you on that one. I&#39;d love to know what&#39;s in her bag as I see her carrying pretty bags all the time. I&#39;ve seen Ghost stories and I can say Jhanvi is a lot better in acting than her contemporaries. Sara definitely is such an overrated celeb and actor.

Jhanvi Kapoor my favorite heroine Alia Bhatt is a monkey
Fake

She is telling basic things which normal girls also eat... Not things like I have eggs for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch and freaking salad for dinner!!!Idk why people hate her!! 😔🤐

I can&#39;t even afford her breakfast
Is she trying to sound silly on purpose haha that vegetarian and nachos bit made me giggle

She is so genuine 😙😙😙

royal blood

Dinner I&#39;ll keep it light like I&#39;ll have red rice biriyani!😂She&#39;s sweet ❣

&quot;I can Make nachos&quot; 🤣🤣
She&#39;s soooooooo sweeeeeeeeeeet....❤
Ty

Confused meal plan

Such a liar

She is the most blessed person in terms of food

Look her hand colour

Ugly looks

Basically, she says she can eat whatever bc she needs to put on weight?🤷🏻‍♀️

Can&#39;t act. bimbo

I dint like this vedio

Greeetings

I recently turned veg...n then tday had fish🤨

I recently turned veg today I had fish tough

Isn’t this lady in her 20s? Why is she talking like a 15 year old kid? And allergy toGluten? Really?  Smh all these star kids sound  like they just landed in india from California

Dinner i like to keep it light so I have  red rice biryani .

Janvi looks yuckk 🤮🤮🤮🤮
plastic  surgery girl.

Love you janhvi😍😍😍
Fake 🤣
Gluten a strict No-No, but eats parathas. Vegetarian but eats fish. You are funny :).

I eat paratha everyday, I don’t eat gluten 😒

She&#39;s a cutie. Let her be , she&#39;s isn&#39;t fake. She&#39;s barely in her 20s , why so much hate ?. She&#39;s ignorant of so many things( like gluten and paratha)  but it&#39;s okay she&#39;ll learn

Dear @pinkvilla plzzzzzzzzzzzz do  the what&#39;s in my bag segment with janhvi kapoor

She is lovely cutipie

How can she be allergic to gluten and have parathas?

Learn Acting swthrt

I love you ❤
You are super cute...I like your speaking style 🤩

You are super cute...I like your speaking style 🤩

Lip job and skin whitening has changed a lot in you

Liar
U r advising us to take all fatty things. Actress never tell us the correct things they take

Allergic to gluten .she is 19 .right ? Strange 😂😂

I can cook coffee in microwave. .by putting coffee ,water,milk  in it 😂😂😂..I know cooking 🤣🤣🤣

Ohh you cook nachos after buying packet 😂😂😂😂 and put cheese. .is that cooking 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I don&#39;t mean to come off as &quot;mean&quot;, but I don&#39;t feel that these actresses are genuine. How can you eat all that paneer and still keep off the weight? I think they&#39;re either hiding the facts or acting like you and me to fit in. That being said, there&#39;s no such word as &quot;ice creams&quot;. Please be real and relevant otherwise it&#39;s just misleading. Thanks!

Who eats that food?
I really feel she is real, genuine and innocent! Good luck on all your endeavors Janhvi!

Can someone please tell me where she got her skin whitening done? I know her nose is by Dr. Raj Kanodia

I just love her she&#39;s incredibly beautiful and down-to-earth Ishaan is a lucky guy

Janvi is so beautiful😘😘😘

How can u eat 1 tbsp of ghee I can’t imagine what does it do to your body tho ??

Janvi💖💖❣️❣️❣️❣️😃😃💟😃💖❣️
Seriously she is biggest dumb ever ...  I turned veg but I had fish.   I eat parathas chocolates ... And she has abs WTF ....  She doesn&#39;t make any sense and she lies alotttt

Those nachos can even be made by a small kid .

Really honest and diet like a Indian middle class girl

Ugly🤣🤣🤣
I feel she&#39;s so sweet♥️ sridevi ji brought up her really well🌈the most pure and beautiful girl among the new comers♥️all the best janhvi

Something “ I can cook I make very good nachos” 😂😂😂😂

Please do this segment with Jennifer Winget :)

Omggggg really these people will troll everything about her?? She is really better and simple compared with other nepo kids.. she is juz doing her work but some cruel people still want to troll her without any reason.. omgg.. she is d only one didn&#39;t give any excitement about working with Karthik like what ananya and sara did.. juz leave her alone.. it&#39;s sad to see these much of hate on her..

If she really ate that much she would be fat. The definition of eating a lot to her is two spoonfuls. What a load of crap!

Nachos 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Such a sweetheart 💌

And all of the people she can really look.. She made veg biryani.. Mira kapoor herself uploaded  it....and sridevi herself praised janhvi... There are some people who is always there to find mistake.....

Waiting for kangana ranaut ☺️
She is so simple...yet talented n pretty....she is an actress who actually enjoys food😍😍💐💐♥️♥️

Trust me no one wants to know 🙂

Honest and lovely

She actually has done a mannat and turned veg for an un announced  movie... She said it in jio mami festival.. The next day we saw her with ekta kapoor.. So may be mannat got fulfilled and she had fish.... Also she is a foody....if you are following her on insta you know it

Cutie

She has a spoon of ghee in the morning..Goodness

What can u make? Oh i can make bhel......full marks beta

Pants on fire.....

I really like Sridevi and her too, she is cute and have nothing against her, but honestly why do I feel she lied. I follow her on Instagram and also her costars interviews, from where it&#39;s obvious that she eats keto diet. I watched Sid Malhotra, I really don&#39;t like him that much, he is okay, but in an instance I knew that he was so much honest when he told what he eats in a day in a video.

That so nice of herShe honestly everythingGreat JhanviAnd she was looking damnnnnnn

Touchwood 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you pinkvilla please do more such videos with janhvi kapoor😀😀🤗🙄👸😇

Love you Janvi you are so much better than Sara

I never noticed how pretty her hair is woahh. It looks so silky and healthy. Fml can’t relate 😔

Red looks good on her

Janhvi is about the carbs! Restricting carbs is bullshit. It all depends on WHERE you are getting the carbs from. Carbs from fruit and carbs from pizza will obviously have VERY different effects on your body/health. Focus on the nutrition. If you only focus on carbs/calories, you may lose weight, but your organs will hate you lmao

I recently turned veg. Today I ate fish though. Jhanvi Kapoor, 2019
