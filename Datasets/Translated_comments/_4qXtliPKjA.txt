Shrek is love, shrek is life

FAKE

Fake on imovie

iMovie....

Its 2020..

We Already Know It's False :v Even though a good video was put in effort
You really made this at Imovie?

You are scary with your trailers
WTF AS IM WRITING THIS. THE LIKES IS 2.1K AND THE DISLIKES IS 2.1K WTF?!

This pretty funny for someone using iMovie and some random clips

Actually... A horror film on Shrek sounds interesting

K

I think the fact that it was made in i movie just makes it better

Gg for using iMovie tho

Onion

This video is funny 

You got this from iMovie

It&#39;s never ogre
When its ogreITS OGRE

Fake sherek horror

Dude you fucking predicted it! Shrek 5 (&quot;Untitled Shrek Reboot&quot;) dated to release in 2019 (but there are some delays maybe?)

Jokes on you, there is actually a Shrek 5 coming in the future.

Onions have layer ogres have <b>layers</b>

I’m waiting for the real Shrek 5 trailer! I’m waiting for the memes that come with it

I really hope they don&#39;t change how Shrek looks like for Shrek 5, I swear if they make him bright grass green I&#39;ll be disappointed

The like and dislike count: <b>Balanced, like all things should be.</b>

Sad satan song?
Shrek 5 is actually coming with no plot xD

This was made with imovie

iMovie.

It’s out later this year 

1.9k likes and dislikes perfectly balanced like all things should be

Holy fuck, when is it playing, I need to see it right now

I’m legitimately disappointed that this isn’t going to happen. I’d wait out side the theater days before opening just to see it

There is really a shrek 5 coming so you probably should be expecting it

Shrek 5 will actually be a prequel to the 1st shrek, so we will know the origins of shrek and how we got to the moment when shrek opens the toilet door to all star!

IMovie...
