Where do you watch it in full? 😢

HERE MY CaT:

😱

Hy &#39;Warner Bros. Pictures&#39; .It part 1 + 2 was very good made in is very good.It&#39;s very rare that a genre have this high quality.For me are both one of the best movies in this genre, because the atmosphere is nice made with the sound, score, effects.If you ever can say &#39;thank you&#39; to the director and everyone.That&#39;s the difference of having passion or only want make money.If you ever get the rights for a &#39;The Darkness&#39; movie it&#39;s important to make a nice score (metal, electro...) and set the right dynamic with new cinematic technology to make rollercoaster action scenes.And if you like listen my song &#39;SCIFU7E - OutsideR&#39;.Good luck for your company, thanks for your products and have nice days + everyone too 🍀🌟 👋♾🍹

Part 3

🤐😇

I’ll be great for the losers club

When people think he says “Come Home To Daddy” I Think he is saying “Come Home To Derry”

<b>Come home to daddy</b>

I hope this will be amazing. thanks I just waiting here in Brazil.

I reeeeeeaaaaallllyyy want to go but won&#39;t get to

<b>cries in east coast</b>

Now that&#39;s just unfairI&#39;m in the uk

Garbage

You&#39;re not my daddy James...

Who in their right mind would want this?

Gosh, I just love James&#39; Scottish accent

То чувство, когда в России фильм  выйдет раньше, чем выйдет мировая премьера.

&quot;Find your way out of the mirror room&quot; 😳 definitely not scary.

They rereleased it in theaters and they showed a little clip of chapter 2

It took me a while to get that the guy said come to Darry and not come to daddy..

These thirsty-ass comments after James McAvoy 😂

im crying why

James McAvoy said “Come Home To Daddy” Change my mind

I’m coming hell yeah!!!!!!!

To bad I live in Europe lmao

Is it a coincidencethat my birthday is when It 2 will premiere?

“Come home daddy” okay i will for you

I wanna see the movie but I’m not old enough to watch rates R movies😭.Im reading the book though at least

What’s with the carnival theme this year

He said “Come to Derry” he had a diffrent accent but the joke is hilarious

Eddie&#39;s actor looks like he&#39;s Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s brother

Ниче не понял, но это ах*енно!!

Who cares about IT 2 chapter when James McAvoy invites you to make him your DADDY.

<a href="">0:10</a> Am I the only one who wants some of those posters?

I wish they can sell more tickets again

I honestly live in the most boring place ever

OMG...I LOVE JAMES MCAVOY SO MUCH!!!!! I SEE ALL YOUR FILMS!!!!!😍😍😍

Tamil dubbed to it

am i the only one that have a phobia of scary clouns and still want to see this movie?

Come home to daddy 😂😂😂

Ends on my birthday 😆

Jessica Chastain 😍😍😘😘

Dont have to convince me other wise. I&#39;m so there!! Movie time!!

I want to go!😭

Why can’t I live in LA😭

Holy shit hearing James talk with his real accent <b>has me feeling some typ&#39;a way</b>

1st part was suck &amp; this one&#39;s too.

Scariest laughing of pennywise <a href="">0:38</a>

I wish they release this movie in india WITHOUT ANY CUTS.

Site kept crashing when I was tryna get tickets 🥺

It sounds amazing!! Unfortunately I won&#39;t be able to attend due to it being so far away and I don&#39;t have the money to travel but I will be watching it the day its released! I would love to go though. Bet it will be awesome!  So excited for the movie. Always been a penny wise fan and a fan of clowns.

At <a href="">0:03</a> I thought it said “Come home to daddy” 😂

Is it September yet ? Just can&#39;t wait anymore.

Bitch i used to explore thecderry sewers as a kid.. Its my home town where they filmed

Can&#39;t afford.

I really expect that Henry&#39;s assault to the Loser&#39;s Hotel is as good as in the book

I can&#39;t go because I&#39;m fucking 16🤦‍♀️😢🤬

“Come home to Derry” boi that heavy accent James has had me thinking he was saying something else. 😂

I’m ready

I want to go there so bad but I live in nyShid

Scottish accent😅😍

DOPE!!!!!

anyone wanna be my sugar daddy and fly me over to Los Angels? lol 😂

SHOULD BE IN TORONTO WHERE THE FILM WAS SHOT!

Bill Skarsgård 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I love you daddy

I live in the UK.... RIP

Yeaahhh 👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻🎉

you should release clips for it Chapter 2

I’m glad it’s basically 18 and over, I don’t want kids running around,

James can do the best American Accent in the World

&quot;come home to derry&quot; yesss daddy whatever you sa- oh you said derry not daddy? oh okay

I actually believe that this is how the kids would look like in 20 years

Hey it&#39;s Alec Holland

“COME HOME TO DADDY”

We all know the true IT experience is a group of boys and there only female friend doing things in a sewer together that will always be cut out of every IT film adaption ever made.

I honestly thought James McAvoy said &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;...I had to rewind
