Where do you watch it in full?

HERE MY CaT:



Hy &#39;Warner Bros. Pictures&#39; .It part 1 + 2 was very good made in is very good.It&#39;s very rare that a genre have this high quality.For me are both one of the best movies in this genre, because the atmosphere is nice made with the sound, score, effects.If you ever can say &#39;thank you&#39; to the director and everyone.That&#39;s the difference of having passion or only want make money.If you ever get the rights for a &#39;The Darkness&#39; movie it&#39;s important to make a nice score (metal, electro...) and set the right dynamic with new cinematic technology to make rollercoaster action scenes.And if you like listen my song &#39;SCIFU7E - OutsideR&#39;.Good luck for your company, thanks for your products and have nice days + everyone too  

Part 3



I’ll be great for the losers club

When people think he says “Come Home To Daddy” I Think he is saying “Come Home To Derry”

Gosh, I just love James&#39; Scottish accent

То чувство, когда в России фильм  выйдет раньше, чем выйдет мировая премьера.

&quot;Find your way out of the mirror room&quot;  definitely not scary.

They rereleased it in theaters and they showed a little clip of chapter 2

It took me a while to get that the guy said come to Darry and not come to daddy..

These thirsty-ass comments after James McAvoy 

im crying why

James McAvoy said “Come Home To Daddy” Change my mind

I’m coming hell yeah!!!!!!!

To bad I live in Europe lmao

Is it a coincidencethat my birthday is when It 2 will premiere?

“Come home daddy” okay i will for you

I wanna see the movie but I’m not old enough to watch rates R movies.Im reading the book though at least

What’s with the carnival theme this year

He said “Come to Derry” he had a diffrent accent but the joke is hilarious

Eddie&#39;s actor looks like he&#39;s Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s brother

Ниче не понял, но это ах*енно!!

Who cares about IT 2 chapter when James McAvoy invites you to make him your DADDY.

<a href="">0:10</a> Am I the only one who wants some of those posters?

I wish they can sell more tickets again

I honestly live in the most boring place ever

I would love to go though. Bet it will be awesome!  So excited for the movie. Always been a penny wise fan and a fan of clowns.

I can&#39;t go because I&#39;m fucking 16‍️

“Come home to Derry” boi that heavy accent James has had me thinking he was saying something else.

“COME HOME TO DADDY”

We all know the true IT experience is a group of boys and there only female friend doing things in a sewer together that will always be cut out of every IT film adaption ever made.
