If you only had $150 to spend on a smartphone, what would you get?

What phone are you talking about

I hate to tell you dude, but Apple is a little bit more better iPhones a little bit more better

150 I can’t even buy a air pod pro …
this should be the standard package!

It looks like an iPhone screen with the notch

Samsung Galaxy A02s
Buy the blu G90 pro, it&#39;s 200$

I would def get this as a second phone to play apk games

I just got a blu c5l smart phone and the picture on videos is worse the terrible its absolutely horrible. I cant believe they would try to hawk this thing.

im sure you can configure how the notch acts like (to not fill it with black)

Redmi 8 (not note) is cheaper

I use blu phones but after a little bit of time it becomes so laggy barley opens YouTube and a very bad camera

Hello my name is Kevin and I watch your videos I recently purchased a no&amp;co phone for about 100$ and it has killer specs almost to good to be true it has not arrived Yet I can not see anything on your channel or online about this company. Maybe you have some information would be great as soon as it arrives (mid January) I will keep you posted

are you afraid to look at the camera?

lol i use a blu phone as my daily driver

Hi! It is 2021! Iam looking for a phone I saw one of these on ebay! Right now undecided still! Either a good working phone for a reasonable price or just a cheap phone.

Rip to the people who believed it😂👍

I&#39;v had 3 different model BLU phones and they were all garbage, never lasted more than a year, in one case i turned it of with 64% battery remaining and it never turned on again

Speaker quality is very bad though.

Blu phones are only good for the 1st few months. This phone LAGS LIKE CRAZY ONCE YOU START TO DOWN LOAD apps. The 1st couple of months it’s awesome tho

Yo thanks for helping me out with my buyers account @HACKERSPRIMEONLINE01 ❤️💯

spend less get more lol...

I have the Blu Bold N1 as a back up phone, it&#39;s super nice for the price, has a fingerprint sensor built under the screen, OLED screen, Android 10, it&#39;s fantastic for the price.

Out of context. Has anybody noticed that the cheaper iPads have a headphone jack and the 1200 dollar iPads don’t ?

I know I&#39;am waaaaaay late to this video, but that design is identical to my Asus Zenfone 5ZEDIT: Apart from the speaker

Try and get customer service on the phone! You will not.

I don&#39;t know where to go from here but a lot of people are talking about the MI T 10?

I have the blu g90 pro and I hate it! It sucks! I am now looking for a new phone and I&#39;ve only had this for two weeks.

Tune in the background?

Gl

L use the phone

My current and previous 3 phones have been from BLU....my current is Vivo XI+...have had it for two years. In another year, will buy a new one just to be updated. I have never had a single issues with the BLU phones. I usually only get the Flagship of their phones. So the price is usually around $250-$400. Mine is USB-C Type, Dual SIM, beautiful phone.

that plant is almost from 5 years

I have one and even the lowest volume is still pretty loud

What Network was it Unlocked from?

Motorola Moto E 2020 is the best $150 unlocked smartphone on the current market

I could buy a used unlocked pixel 3 xl on eBay for 150$

150$ phone: 2 cases, screen protector, headphones, charger &amp; brick, and actual phone.1100$ phone: just the phone

Who else thought it was an iPhone 10?

Go a little more for an Umidigi Bison or S5.

I recommend the g9 it&#39;s the same price with better specs

it&#39;s funny because I actually have had the xl4 for 2 years now and love it. the only downside to me was the os. it runs android oreo

I really appreciate your service coder_mich, you are the best ever! for any type of unlocked problem visit them they are the best fast and reliable
I really appreciate your service coder_mich, you are the best ever! for any type of unlocked problem visit them they are the best fast and reliable
i cant hear

Anyone own OnePlus7?

Not the highest resolution display but still a better one then iPhones

Quality over quantity..

Cheap phone full with stuffApple we should remove the charger and earpods and apple stickers should now be one People why must tou hurt our wallet like this Apple your rich right then buy our magsafe case people man thats useless Were moving to samsung

Looks like trashI would prefer throwing 50$ at an iPhone SE which is still smooth and all round good

I did not watching long time but like

&quot;you&#39;re gonna have a headphone jack&quot;that&#39;s it..that&#39;s it&#39;s selling point thanks

Ok I&#39;m gonna be honest, other than my first ever phone, I forgot that blu existed

Blu xl6. I just got it. $109. Even better !!!¡!
It looks like the iPhone 11 pro max cuz of the notch .

Ordered it up

What a garbage

Good video!!

Hi

Aint no body watch this!

I had this phone and I really recomend it

A question that I and so many others have that you could answer so easily...WHAT ANDROID PHONES, NEW OR USED, WOULD YOU BUY IF YOU HAD $350 TO SPEND?

This is how many times he says holy smokes👇🏼

<a href="">0:53</a> What&#39;s wrong with it?

Would u recommend over an old Google pixel 2xl?

<a href="">5:07</a> hope they fix it in the next update2020-did they fix that?

need a review on the g90 pro please

WHO is 2020 ???

He mentions what shape the USB plug is, why do we care if it is C or B, mini? I mean if you&#39;re living on the economy side but I doubt anyone has converted all of your stuff to type c already anyway

funny line : how did you get more when you spend less ?

how much did he say the phone was?

Hey could you make video about infinix hot 8 lite

You&#39;re gonna use it a couple of time.Me: YOU&#39;RE ONLY GONNA USE PRIME VIDEO A COUPLE PF TIME?

GooooooooooD Job

That is look like condom box😂

Is it a cdma or gsm?

Blu phones would be great if they fixed the speaker volume is weak.

The Samsung Galaxy A01 with a case &amp; sd card (is what id get with 150$)

Boost Mobile $50 plan is terrible  you only get 2 weeks will  good internet  now the internet works terrible I want to get my phone throw in the garbage

Who else misses the I&#39;m switching

Watching on my Samsung A70. $393 but should be priced $250. The performance is upsetting.

If someone was on a budget of 150 bucks u could have saved just 25 bucks more and got the honor play that I use its amazing it can support fortnite too if u are a gamer with a budget the honor play is perfect for u

My Blu V7 (or G6, they cant seem to decide on the model name) is half the price and as far as i can tell, even better.

my tablet cant even run pubg mobile lite at 30 fps

$1000 phone no headphone jack   $150 phone headphone jack
i paid $250 dollars for my phone with 1080x2460 resolution 4000 mah battery 3+64g of memory  a fast charger  android 10

check it out the honor 9x pro cheap and good performance

Still got mine ....slowing up a bit looking for another now..no problems

I&#39;m watching this video on my brand new BLU V90! Its a great phone!

Its a really bad review, since you are comparing a $150 smartphone to $1000 flagship phones.

I got my huawei y7 2019 for 120$ and still is a better experience than this 150$phone

u should check out umidigi phones.

<a href="">3:54</a> Thank me later
Good description for little need for everything u need for $15O...bit likey but I want a motorola prefer that vivo sir

But Y
Best kept secret.Buy this instead.Umidigi Power 3Same $150 price from eBayUSA seller also.

6 years ago in third grade my first phone was a Blu Dash Jr. I loved that little guy. Now here I am with a OnePlus 7 Pro. Lots of growth. I can&#39;t believe I owned that thing when I wal little! 😂

Yo i like what you do keep it up got a  quesion how the viewers kno it not not fron local store not some web

This is a great phone to get a kid that’s in high school when they won’t stop complaining that they don’t have a smartphone.

Huge description
Android&quot;when you pay less, they give   you more&quot;Apple:we don&#39;t do that here

It just looks like their trying to be an iPhone 10

I did get this phone, one warning. BE CARE FULL WHERE YOU BRING THIS PHONE!!!! My phone&#39;s battery didn&#39;t want to stay alive without the power saver because I brought it to camping at cold temperature.

Is this a Chinese manufacturer?

iphone 6 or 7

I have a $70 smartphone with USBC

People are buying this because it&#39;s cheap. You can laugh about it all you want... that doesn&#39;t change anything

What is the second best selling smart phone?

I have the Samsung J2... It&#39;s FREAKING amazing... Much less then this phone and works great 👌

it looks like a perfume box or a box for shorts  :D

Phones aren&#39;t &quot;locked&quot; in Canada. They still do that in the states? Wow.

Its look like a fake iphone from wish

Ofc all boys have <a href="">0:44</a>

I have a lot of Micro-USB cables around the house in 2020. That&#39;s a bonus in my book!

It&#39;s good value for that low of a price tbh

Thank you.  However, on hindsight, this is not a great buy as Blu has decided not to upgrade to Android 10. Although Blu G9 Pro has the specs to support Android 10 (and even 11), Blu apparently do not want to invest in upgrades for what is one of their flagship products. Incidentally, their Bolt flagship mobile is being upgraded to Android 10. By not investing in support and upgrades, a lot of Blu users including me will not buy Blu products any more in future. I know that we get what we pay for - but that is the difference between a real customer focused company and a mere distributor who puts their logo on cheap Chinese phones. Any thoughts?

I&#39;ve bought two BLU smart phones. And the first Vivo 5, stopped working and no updates to keep it going. I bought my second one VIVO 8 and the touch screen stops working at times and I have to turn off the phone and back on. I then said FUCK it, am not wasting more money on cheap Chinese parts, and bought the new SAMSUNG S20! Fuck BLU!! It&#39;s cheap for a reason!!!

just think that there are way better players in that price bracket these days

for 150 dollars i will buy a phone cover for iPhone 11 pro max

iphone se

laggy? typical android then

What is the beat?

u have 150 and u don&#39;t spend it on xiaomi ? wth is wrong with u

I want buy this blu thing There is other Alternative

Background music?
I have never liked blu. They NEVER have a good battery life.

Dude! I think is time u go for a few months to a diferent culture, $150 in 70% the rest of the world is half  of a month wage, what porcentage of northamerican will spend 2k on a phone? Did u cross over? R u aiming to the top10%?

The song in this video at least in the first half, (cause that&#39;s what part of the video I&#39;m at) is boosting my high like nuts

Moto g⁷ supra. $111.06 shipped with tax and first month of service on cricket.

I think this is the same company that made the Ultra limited gold phone in the weirdest phones in the world 2Am I wrong or I&#39;m just going crazy

For $150 I would buy a used iPhone 6s

Hello, I have both this phone and the C5L phone.  How do you make a screenshot?  For example, if I&#39;m in my email and need to send this screenshot to a friend, I don&#39;t see an option on how to do this?

low audio

you can get this on my website

I have this phone. Blu was a great company was they first started.I have this phone nothing but problems  glitches apps open and close. You get what you pay for.Budget will get the job done.

It&#39;s probably the first cheap smartphone that pops up.  Older people don&#39;t care about specs n shit.  There&#39;s a lot of phones like this on there.  Like hundreds or seems like.

I loved my LG v30 because of that fingerprint scanner/ power button combo in the middle of the phone. I got a wired headset with my s10 plus. And the bt ones.

naaah, US$ 150, I chose to get Redmi Note 7 instead

Ok now your finger print is been sold on the dark web

Hey Unbox Therapy May You Please Review the Huawei Enjoy 10 Plus (the one with the popping camera) I just wanna hear your opinion. Thank You😁

Waiting for BLU to blew up

And here i m using a 100$ phone😑

That, of course

oh my god, i just noticed B, Bold L,Like U,Us BLU

The police told me ... Take a case it&#39;s on the house LoL 😂

An iPhone 6 works better than this

<a href="">4:16</a> some phones after they start up (like androids) lag when they start. That is what my cousins Alcatel phone did.

Honor 8X❤️
Just got the phone and it&#39;s pretty good for 150 dollars

This fucking company batteries not available in india

Mine was great came preloaded with firmware embedded malware..

It looks like an iPhone on the front. Until you start using it.That’s a pretty cool camera, though 🙂

$150 phone:Headphone jack, two cases, screen protector$1000 phone:fuck you
Not bod

Bought a z5 premium for $80, and a pixel XL for $90. The z5 premium is a lot better though

Redmi note7/8 is really better for the same price

Sir aapki YouTube income kya hai

&quot;how do you pay less and get more?&quot;   I feel like I&#39;ve been screaming this from a rooftop for years and no one is listening to me.  Especially apple cult members.   I&#39;ve never spent over $200 on a phone, and my life is completely fulfilled.

Put off you cap for a moment please!!

He brother please please please Sell me fold 2 Escobar 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

It&#39;s a good choice. you don&#39;t wanna hack the NASA&#39;s camputers with your phone do you?

Iphone, We want your moneyAndroid,We want you to have a better phone for a &quot;cheap&quot; price

the phone is great and i hope to see more company competing on

94

Spend less to get more😂

$150 price range phones are not worth it because for another $50 to $100 you get way better specs

Lew,Can you unbox and review the teracube phone? Claims to have a 4 year factory warranty!!!!

cheap but goverment in China  will Know your  private life for sure!

What do you do with all those phones? If you might be giving one away I&#39;m in desperate need.. Starting school in April.

It makes me mad when people refer to spending under $300 on a phone as cheap, that is very expensive, let alone spending $1000 on one

$89 now

redmi note 7 will piss on this  shit

this phone is shit

I can bearly watch your videos because I don&#39;t have a phone

The door is blue

The beauty mode is op

I use this as my backup phone and it&#39;s great for a short period of time

Now $89

Basically a Galaxy A20.

Something else.

I have a BLU phone I&#39;m watching this video on a BLU phone actually!

Looks very functional.

That phone is cheaper than my earbuds.

That’s an x4L.

BTW, Blu is American, not Asian, there from Floryda

Samsung Galaxy J6 is a great phone for around that price

Anyone play pubg on one... i play on my j7 crown so i kno this will

Then you should try Walton Rx7 mini. The 80-90 dollar smartphone. But I know you never heard that brand name.

Umidigi Pwr
I got a BLU phone a couple of years ago, the power button fell off 2 months after purchase.

We have this company in Iraq

Your are pretty much comparing it to some iPhone 11 Pro Max 💁‍♂️

from the thumbnail i thought this was the iphone X Tbh

Is this phone compatible with T-Mobile?  I bought an Orbic only to find out it&#39;s RECALLED!! FOR OVERHEATING!!   (quick buy as my temporary replacement)this seems like a good phone to go see in person.

Lew, good to see you doing some vids on regular phones

Most of the people i see are using head phones with wires......what kind of world are these phone unboxers living in when they say....&quot;look there&#39;s a phone jack!!!!.....omg!!!!......im like huh???

Would&#39;ve been nice for my flagship device 2 cost$150

I don&#39;t care the price point there is no excuse for Oreo in 2020.

Batterie dies whithin 4 hours!!!

Why does it bother me that he is a good model for photography. Every picture he takes is like bizzare

How bout the umidigi a5 pro?

Why not try realme smartphone plssss if you read this comment

For the same price I bought a LG G7 ThinQ. Better looking for flagships that devalues so fast 💅

my phone is worth $180 dollars quad camera, snapdragon chipset, gorilla glass 3+, but polycarbonate plastic case.. when it comes to the price, its too friendly and its good for me..the durability almost like quality of an expensive phones.

They probably do that because stores don’t sell cases or screen protectors for that phone

So many isheeple in the comment section

Of corse a asian phone would have a eye enlarger hahaha

Holly smokes

My aunt got that phone for my cousin since she wasn’t so sure if she would take care of an expensive phone. She’s pretty happy with that one

Lmao had this phone for a day and the phone sim card reader started wigging out to be honest not a good phone even for $150  and I haven&#39;t watched the whole video yet but im just warning yall and love the vids lew

pretty much an iPhone 10 on android

I&#39;m watching this on Blu C5X

This is for the people from pakistan 150 dollars = 24000 rupees u could get such a good phone in that price tag who agrees

Who else thought it was an iPhone  X

This guy is so full of life here. Hes super boring on his later clips channel.

it looks like a perfume box

2020, the new one makes some good upgrades, but still no type C

Samsung m10s
I’ve had three phones from BLU and I’ll tell you they work fine  for the first few months but then they start glitching,running out of storage, shutting down, etc. they aren’t meant to be long term heavily used phones

I am saving money for sharp Aquos S2. I think  the phone I&#39;m saving for is more affordable4gb ram64gb internalSnapdragon 630 14nmOS 8.1 updatable5.5 inchNotch phone2017 phoneIn my country its price point is 5600 to 5990phpAround 120$ to your country i think

They probably spent way too much on the packaging 😂

nice

The only thing about this (I’ve had one) it’s a meh phone that breaks down after a while (meaning like a year maybe two)

I love that phone

Did he also mention it have has Face ID

I will never get this phone 1st of all,the processor is bad,it heats up alot,it has 32 of storage,3 of ram,and for $150 never,i got my moto g7 power at $140 dollars and it works perfectly,has a snapdragon 636,better processor,4 of ram,64 of storage,this one overall is better oh and it has 5000 mAh battery.

Buy Moto E6S instead XD

Blu g9 pro sum else tho🔥

holy smokes

redmi 5 plus still best budget smartphone fight me

I&#39;m watching on a vivo y93

Garbage phone LMAO

Try the Blu v9

I just got a moto g7 power as my daily, the batery life is way longer than I need it to be, it has fast charging and its around the same price but it dousnt lag at all. Its actualy preaty snapy &amp; it uses android 9! Way better than this beta male piece of dog poo your showing us.

STILL HAS A HEADPHONE JACK

What happen to the gadgets after u unboxed it? Please give me a phone 😟 😂

I use a $99 unlocked BLU V5

Does that music play all around you when you carry the phone around?🤔

So this being &quot;unlocked&quot; does this mean it will work on Walmart&#39;s straight talk network?I&#39;m techno challenged 🙄Need a new phone I can use on my straight talk plan.

Slave labor.

BLU V7 how do you pop the back off of it?

Are BLU phones reliable now? I bought a budget flagship Blu phone back in 2015 for my wife. I forgot the name of it but it was a piece of shit. Random freezes, overheating, unresponsive... It was a shit phone that died in 8 months.

You can get so much better for $150. Even in the US 😅

My last blu was a windows phone mi next blu vivo xi+

Opera has been my default browser for 3 years

This is just a shit phone

step 1 get 10m+ subscribersStep 2 buy shares in a budget phone providerStep 3 make a video saying its the best selling phone on AmazonProfit

Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 or Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is a powerhouse for the money! in a couple years these lower end phones with be on the level of the $1000 phones or beat them. after buying the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, I would never spend $1000 or more for a flagship phone. I saved myself $700 or $800 on a phone that I&#39;ll keep 1 year.

No nutch 4 me thanks.

Why would anyone buy this...  G9 pro... Wayyyyh better....

oh the selfie shot🤣🤣🤣🤣
if i had £40 i will spent it on mate 20 pro fake mate 20 pro

My Umidigi Power is better than this phone with a smaller notch and cheaper also.

its now way cheaper

nobody:lew:HOLY SMOKES

Realme x
Him: <b>this is the best selling phone on Amazon</b> Also him: <b><i>slams phone on table several times</i></b>

Motorola is chinese.

Bro why is BLU still alive, I had 2 BLUs phones and one of them almost exploded lmao

I would get a second hand, mid-range device

Hey with the Mediatek processor you can play games, make some calls, and then fry morning breakfast of bacon and eggs.  (From my experience, these procs get HOT.)

This phone is now down to $100. November 2019 ( This can&#39;t be beat for the price )If you want something better but still cheap the Moto G6 power international version is about $170. ( My pick )What do you get for the extra $70.... Twice the internal storage. One more GB of RAM. Even longer lasting battery.It also feels sturdier so it won&#39;t break as easy. I do enjoy the Moto actions for turning on flash light too.Good phone for construction workers and people who don&#39;t want to charge their phones often.Anything more than $200 is just throwing money in the trash. Flag ships are dead.

It is better than nothing!

Dont buy this phone, the software s_cks , my blu xl4 is always getting software problems, you may need to install a stock room,  but dont buy it

Will it play pokemon go?

Just got clickbaited for a low end Chinese phone, I feel that this channel isn&#39;t real anymore.

Just once I would like to see someone make an actual phone call .To see what the connectivity is like.

i just bought the redmi note 7 pro (6g+128g) yesterday for like 142.50 usd

this phone i guess

After seeing a lot of cheap phones on amazon uk I bought a uleFone Note 7P for £85 ($110) I bought it just to see if they were any good as a main/2nd phone

Prior to that I had never heard of the uleFone brand but as it was &#39;Amazons Choice&#39; I took a chance and I bought it.I bought a 128GB microSD £17.50 card formatted too it as internal memory so now a 160GB phone which is plenty of storage for me. 32GB is too small.3 years ago I bought iPhone 7 Plus at launch which I still use, it cost me €1,200 and the original Galaxy Note €299 on 24-month contract @ €35 per month so expensive at the time. 

It&#39;s not fair to compare an iPhone with these cheap phones that cost 1/10th of the price of latest and greatest

If it runs and takes phone calls for $150.00 it&#39;s a great device!

If you have $150 why not just get a used iPhone 6s?

This is not a clash : 150$ for a smartphone. You discovered that most people can afford the products you show.

&quot;It&#39;s not terrible.&quot;

I got my Stylo 4 for $90 best price for budget phone with pretty good specs

Do you review about smart watches too??? Cuz I don&#39;t see any yet. Looking forward for it too. Huge fan 😊

But with 100 $ we can have huawei y7 prime which is better than this phone

id get a motorola maby a new one

I buy Blu for a reason. Not only are their better phones great phones at very reasonable prices. But unlike most phones, Blu phones will let you hotspot and use the data on your phone at the same time, most devices do not. Also they will let you hotspot and not pay the retarded hotspot charge to your provider. Is this phone the fastest most powerful thing out there? No. But most people aren’t looking for nor need that. They want a phone that works, works smoothly, and doesn’t break the bank.Also most of the higher end Blu phones with 4+ gigs of ram and even some of the 3 gig models have exceptional battery life, even if they are less than 4mah batteries.

It’s like a hybrid of a Google Pixel, iPhone and Samsung-

And now it is ordered

I get the Pocophone F1 for 170 dollars...

Its piece of shit for 150$ Xiaomi&#39;s phone much better than this

Samsung: <b>gives you super AMOLED on their midrange and budget galaxy phones and octa core processors as well as android 9 PIE and gorilla glass</b>BLU: HOLD MY CHEAPNESS

weellllll since you asked.  I am 61... my children are grown - I take a pic of my cats now and then... so camera not important to me.  Need to text, gmail, and fb msgr; gotta have chrome, amazon prime, and youtube.  I don&#39;t care about a bit of lag time. I got time to wait. So this looks like a phone I should read more about.  Thank you for your detailed review.

The amount of stuff they include let&#39;s you know how much money the big companies are making by giving you nothing

Never show that booting animation to a Filipino just don&#39;t

looks like the iphone 10

Darn it.  The &quot;notch&quot; makes it a non starter for me.

I need a link to that song that Lew was playing when he was testing out the speaker. It had the old Asian dude with glowing eyes.

BLU really make nice and affordable devices

blu is garbage does not have customer service

Is that a human🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dats 150 dollars? if it was launched in India it would&#39;t be sold as low for $70, i have bought a AndroidONE Nokia device with Helio p60 for around $90

How is it that a 150 dollar phone is obligated to have a headphone jack but a $1000 phone isn&#39;t? Shouldn&#39;t it be the exact opposite?

Ill take it its fine i want it ill make the most of it give it to me!!

Who ever designs a notch+chin on a smartphone is a stupid motherfucker!(Zero chin+small Forehead) Is that too much to ask for???

Looks like some cheap gift that&#39;ll be included with some product purchases.. like kitchen appliances or something..

Well we only do
Shout out to the little plant

After watching this, I&#39;m going go make a grilled cheese sandwich because this review was satisfying for the price of the smartphone.

Never heard of it, never seen one, from what I seen its not very good.

Another knockoff iPhone and this moron is praising this. I just watched 1 second of the video and I can predict the rest.

That music...😁😁
Nah, you got enough money, get your own caseI honestly like cheaper phones that work just as good! I am not going to spend 1,000 dollars just for the name!

Bruh I have a BLU vivo xl5

If you don’t want to watch the video, basically it’s a cheap iPhone X that runs Android.

Yet I&#39;ve actually never seen someone with one of these kind of devices. Must be a lot of sales in India or something or through lesser carriers who you have to bring your device to

Spend less on a refurbished iPhone SE?

Dir this price you could get the samsung A20 i would rather Take the a 20

I dropped my blu phone from 1 foot and it got cracks alll over the screen. Slowly the screen started dying because rock were denting the innards because I didn’t know it was exposed from the drop.

In India you can buy phone better than this at a 100USD

Isn&#39;t the best selling phone nophone??

$99.00 now

Motorola Moto g7, which is exactly wat I did...

I bought A Mobile phone Lg g5 In Only 65$ 4gb Ram And 32Gb mem Running Excellent FUNGERPRINT SCREEN 2 BACK CAM ULTRA WIDE

for 150 you can get a honor 10 where I live which is a pretty damn good phone even when put up against phones in the 400 bracket.

Still laughing at the fact he keeps mentioning unlocked haha..

Throws screen cleaner on floor lol...

I feel terrible now for buying the p30 pro for 1,200€ on release. HONESTLY.

Please make a video review on real MI pro 5 and realme XT

Please review the HONOR 8X

or get a one plus 3 or pixel og for 150

OMGFD ITS THE SAME WAY LIKE THE MOTOR G7 POWER 😲😲
I would get an iphone se

Try realme 3 😁

What is the song at 6.07

<b><i>holy smokes!</i></b>Heaven clouds: am i a joke to u

Its $110 now

Thats a samsung A10  with different apps.....

Blu is one of the worst. That processor is soo slow

cheap phones are life now. everyone spending all this money on shit that works for 1 year and has a tiny battery

Some drugs to flip, until I have money for one of the devices I want.

Does it support wifi calling?

get samsung galaxy a20 instead
that is a crap ass phone 😂😂😂 there are much better options even on this price point you could get a freaking Samsung a10

Anyone knows where can I buy the fake plant that lew uses for the camera tests?

The phone... meh. That packaging though.. love it, probably cost half the price of the phone.

Hmm looks kinda familiar
Oh yeah yeah

My p10 that is unlocked has better specs and I spent 120 pounds, it came with a bumper case and glass screen protector too, with charger and headphones, except the box. And it has sd card slot and a headphone jack, stuff you lose on some flagships

Hello you have many cp can I get one because my cp is so laggy

published a day before my berth dea

How much is Amazon paying you?

Basically a work phone and one you can pretty much just keep in the car and use to play stuff while you&#39;re on the road. Not bad. Might look into it.

Vivo xl5 now
It&#39;s not great.... but not terrible either

Yes, it&#39;s 150 bucks... I was looking for a cheap smart phone for my mom, so I opted for BLU phones... Ended up buying 3 due to failures... The BLU phones I bought then were about $100... So after 3 phones, that means I ended up spending $300... So I realized I&#39;m better off buying a better brand phone...

Don&#39;t trust people with profile pictures shot by a Vivo or Oppo phones

Please a video for best budget to specs ratio on smartphones under 200$ at amazon.

If you want a great phone in your budget come to india or china

I&#39;m done buying expensive phone is not worth it no more honestly really think about it do you really use everything on the phone no you don&#39;t so what&#39;s the point that phone has a awesome camera and video I love it

You should try Wiko View Prime thats is pretty good phone for 150 $ i mean 4gb ram and 64gb memory and 28 mp selfie camera 😂🤣🤣🤣

I had about 100 - 150 when I needed a smartphone on short notice after my current one shut down and wouldn&#39;t come back on even after hours charging. Samsung took about a month to complete warranty process, so to bridge the gap I got a Moto X4 for $100 and for that price it&#39;s an incredible phone. 5.1 inch screen about&#39;s with a decent LCD screen (1080p).So I&#39;d def pick Samsung of Moto for low end.

Supreme should have use this phone

Me:$150 budgetBuy Redmi Note series$400 budgetBuy Redmi K20 Pro$600 budgetBuy RedmiBook 14
I can see the pixels from africain

Omg! What is that who is that? 😂

Mi A2 lite $150

if you watch this now, you should know that the Samsung Galaxy A20e is also 150$ with usb type c, smaller notch and so onso dont waste your money on this noname company

This is really good for people that use smartphones for basic stuff Calls, messages, emails, Social media Games like Clash of clans , Candy Crush

The we only do
I&#39;ve got Samsung j3 achieve. New it&#39;s $135 on Amazon. Get this or another j model. It&#39;s just better

Please check out Coolpad Cool 3 plus, $83, phone with cool features

Had like budget phones in the past. Lasted a year, slow, pixels then switched to Motorola G6, happy. Still works maybe it depends on which industry you are in. I&#39;m in construction so it does all emails, social media, phoning and etc. May be next one will be a G7- same price, a little bit of everything that we need

Reviewers like this focus on the expensive, the &quot;best&quot; &quot;greatest&quot; &quot;fastest&quot; phones...which are primarily used for...watching this channel and browsing facebook. Nothing wrong with this phone, don&#39;t waste money based on what reviewers say but make a choice base on your budget and need. Btw the market for that phone is for emerging markets.We need a more consumer-driven market not a reviewer-driven market for smartphones.Think, research and make a decisoon for yourself. Don&#39;t be a the hoopla behind a product be your sole decision to purchase.

I find it funny because im not sure who the lower end smartphones are aimed at. I guess the responsible people who are on a tight budget. Because most of the people in their 20&#39;s who dont have money will buy the new iphone every year and just take the bus to work instead of saving for a car.

Apple is just for un educated materialistic people

Have you done unboxing samsung galaxy A50
Hey Lew, have you had a look at the Lenovo Tab v7?

I&#39;m currently using a SUPER old Blu phone. I&#39;m in need of a new one lol

I hate that you are so negative about the phone men .

<b>In India,only the reting count of the BEST SELLING PHONE (Flipkart) is higher than the Whole population of Canada</b>

It&#39;s a good starter phone for kids

will indian sim cards work in this phone?

Check out tecno spark 3
are you sure is not a xiaomi redmi note 6 with a different name?

pp lol
Can you unbox tehe Samsung Galaxy J4+ PLS
As far as accessories included go, this phone gets a 10/10.

Who else is wondering if it is verizon compatible

This is a bad phone has good specs but it&#39;s a bad phone I literally never dropped it once and my screen popped out customer support wouldn&#39;t replace it is this cuz they said that I dropped it and like I said I never dropped that thing once

me reads description how the hell can iPhone save your life???????????!1!!!!!!!!!1

Apple would sell all of that for $1,000

Actually the best selling cheap phone on Amazon actually UMIDIGI A3 PRO can you please do a video on it please

you can buy Huawei Y7 Prime 2019with $150 and that&#39;s a super smartphone for that price, absolutely no lagsnice speed, fair display, etc

I dont take many pics cheap phones are fine for me

I have a xi+ but I had a xl3 and both phones were amazing, I love blu, and I highly recommend these phones

Lol this phone at 150.00 is better than any iphone 😂

Please get realme x

Realme x
HOLY SMOKE?!!😂😂

hello sir my name is sufyan
Unbox the umidigi a3 pro

Realme
I wonder what Lew does to the 100s of devices that he unboxes

Hits the box while fliping box

<a href="">6:54</a> alien investigation completed
I just want a decent screen size 2-300$ Straight Talk phone with a headphone. Anyone got ideas?

Why do you keep slamming everything on the table man?

Man just search realmi 3i on flipkart then u will be shocked it has 3+32,13,13+2,Helio p60,4230mh,dew drop notch , diamond cut

Im watching on the xl4

Anyone check his description there are lots of link

I think if it functions as a phone the software is just a plus for that price because you can use this phone for your essentials and then just use your tablet. Most people spend too much money on their phones especially if you already have a descent tablet. The price points for the newer mainstream phones are just not realistic for the average person period. I think this phones is great.

Should review the Huawei Y9

Why is it you never introduce it as a VIVO smartphone???

Cheapest ever
Dam the lag

this was published on my b-day

Does anyone know if this will work with Metro by T-Mobile

3310

What is the notch? Not familiar with that?

Budget phone... But a really good one

Disgaea never give really review he always try to sell for company 😂

It&#39;s the best selling on Amazon because Amazon does not resell all phones. There are far better phones on the market that are NOT sold by Amazon. You&#39;d think Amazon would have EVERYTHING, right? Welp, you&#39;d be wrong.

It looks exactly like the redmi note 6 pro.

@<a href="">5:38</a> Temp -6°C....😱😱Are you sitting inside a Freezer???
Tell me why I paid 700$ for this!! 😂I&#39;m dead

Do these work a straight talk ?

You gotta remember that yes for you it might not be the best phone because you are used to having 1000$ phones but there’s more people that can’t afford them, ppl from other countries etc. Tbh that phone is really great

Tumbnail got messed up XD

Almost same specs as an XR... 1.8k more

Hey bro, how come in every device you get the same selfie which are the best selfies

FUCK THIS WIFI GATBAGE SHIT

its might gonna be the best phone if its in my hand since i dont own any

Its laggy cuz it just got turned on lol

At least it&#39;s not an apple phone

did anyone relize the noch went up

I have this same phone jus in Gray

When a foreign phone brand gives you headphone with their phone but america can give you headphone

I got my LG V35 thinq for 260 on Swappa

Is it great for a gamer + fotographer to have a oneplus 5 in 2019 ??

I prefer a30 its way better plz inbox the a30

I just noticed you always wear a hat

U could get better UMIDIGI a3 PRO for 99 dollars

What&#39;s wrong with the description

Just because I&#39;m an idiot, I&#39;ve bought at least 3 BLU cameras due to their price points for smart phones for my mom... They&#39;ve all failed. I found better brand phones are just a little bit more expensive and have a much better reliability... So you save money buying the initial phone, but then you&#39;re losing money as soon as you have to buy a replacement phone when it fails...

My grandma has that exact phone but hers didnt come with a case or a screen protector

Stop banging the table!

Software update should fix the issues

when you start a phone up bud...give it maybe some time to boot? Or 😂

With this low price..its ok.🙏

low mid range is xiaomi realm no question asked

150$ phone: Has headphone jack1000$ phone: No headphone jack
Is that a paid video

Something else

You could buy an iPhone 6s the same price

How about the Blu Rs plus 2019

I do know a way how to make it fast

It’s an huawei nova 3i or 3e and you are joking

They are very slow...crappy phones

do give way doud

Lmao same display as the iPhone xr

Its vivo again folkss!!
thinking of getting refurbished phones

It would be nice if you compare performance to an iPhone series , as in its about same as ‘iPhone 6’ or iPhone 7 ectera. I only say iPhone as they don’t mega change and many people have had or used one.

f

when your broke and want a good phone, i recommend thiswhen your rich...JUST BUY A DAM <b>IPHONE XS MAX</b>

Pls do an unboxing of xiaomi redmi 7

“Nah you got enough money, get your own case” lmao

<a href="">7:00</a> what was that 😂😂😂

I have this phone and it&#39;s better than most Samsung&#39;s I&#39;ve seen

It’s literally the an android copy of the iPhone x

The plant is the best freaking photoshoot model.

The picture isn&#39;t bad, especially when it come to looking at your face

You complain to much, it&#39;s for the poor people and that includes me. Send it to me I want complain

Can you please do lg rebel 4

Mi A2 lite

Blu smartphones are trash hands down I am a Moto guy for life lol

You&#39;ll probably be a little blue, if you ordered an unlocked BLU

haven&#39;t seen one of thosein a box in a whilerap 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Can it WhatsApp? YESCan it Facebook? YESCan it Instagram, tweet, play music and videos, make calls, send messages, Snap photos, Do everything that a smart phone can do. YES YES YES. BUT IT&#39;S NOT SNAPPY. Shut up I need 5 pieces.

Is it VR capable 🧐

Because the GPU/CPU it&#39;s nothing for Gaming. That&#39;s the main reason why I wouldn&#39;t  buy it.

just buy a used flagship that is 1 or 2 years old on ebay, example the LG G7-6

Hey Lue, what is that music that you used in this video. Ive looked around everyehere, and i cant figure out what it is🤔

I heard it comes with chick-fil-a coupons as well

Stock Android is the only way I will ever go.Great value for money .It will do anything most people need a phone for.

I have the Motorola g6 and it was about $200 when I bought it but now that the g7 is out it&#39;s probably closer to that $150 price point and I really like it for how much money I spent. I think the specs are a bit better and it&#39;s not as laggy as this Blu phone you&#39;re showing but I do wish it was mainly a full screen experience since it&#39;s bezels are kind of ugly and unnecessary.

Parents buying for their kids? That can contribute to a budget Amazon product selling really well

Hi Blu vivo here for flex tape, the super strong tape that can instantly fix high prices

Where am I ??

I got a wired headset with my s10+

OMG my mom is the Design director for blue

What does &quot;unlocked device&quot; mean?

Real me3

Can you try sharp aquos s3? Review please ? Thanks

Can translate to arabic language

Would buy anything but a Blue device.

skip to <a href="">3:52</a>thank me later

Blu are one of the very few phones compatible with the obamafone system. People are buying those to use with obamafone service... lol... oh also, they’re the company that was saving everybody’s text messages and sending them to their home offices in China.... 🤨

this phone is extremely worth it I bought it not expecting much but it&#39;s actually almost the same specs as my girlfriend&#39;s iPhone and I was extremely impressed with it because the price was very cheap

In my country this device is rebranded by Allview for the whole Europe.... Cool ... Cool

BLU was my second smartphone and a BLU for my brother&#39;s first smartphoneNobody cares I know already

Waste of money. Buying a used samsung s or an iphone is better.

I had blu phone before

Bro its just like lenovo k8 just the difference is abt the resolution

I&#39;d rather spend another $100 for a phone that doesn&#39;t lag.

People!! I got this phone earlier this year, this phone is GARBAGE!!!! Slow af, even with wifi, dropped calls and overall laggy. Do not get this phone, buy a Samsung Galaxy A6 if you&#39;re gonna buy a budget phone

Most people buy a phone just to play games and use Facebook Snapchat etc You can do that with an 1000$ phone and a 150$ phone

Sok a duma!

At first I thought that phone was Google Pixel 4 XL.

Man there is Lot of perants out there with kids some have one some have 3 some have 7 and some have 10 kids. Who has your cash Lew it&#39;s perfect for people who can&#39;t afford apple or Samsung or pixel for them selves or kids who may smash it after a week or 2

So my question  is do all of these super bargain priced sweet sounding devices work in the US on AT&amp;T? I broke my galaxy 7 active it&#39;s been getting hot. Spent 100 to replace battery and about 2 months later dropped it and crash goes screen and backlight. Currently using my slow as hell galaxy 5 with a broken camera. I have a friend that has one of these BLU vivo xl4 loves it. I&#39;m leaning this way just can&#39;t see spending 8 bills on something  that&#39;ll be obsolete  in a few years If not months

Spend $200, then get Xiaomi Note 7... Better screen and faster 2.2 GHz CPU...That is what I have now...

Reasonable price... For a reasonable chipset ._.

U honestly talk too much istg at the begining u spent about like 2 minutes just for the intro I mean yeah I can just skip but it just makes it boring

Can i have a phone just one plss i want to help my mom because she dont have a phone plss a beg you🙏🙏

Its Looks like Xiamoni Redmi note 5 .!
ALL BLU PHONES ARE GARBAGE

I actually hated the fingerprint location in that phone

Use it every day.

Thanks for the video and review nice smart phone.

That plant is more famous than us

This is the OnePlus 2 Version 0.9

Watching this on a 2day old iPhone XS Max

Hey in india for 150 $ you can get Type c Full hd displaySd 660 or helio p704000mah Better camera

Does an unlocked phone mean it has no cell but u can put any carrier in it?Cause my dad said right now, the closest thing you get to a phone is an iPod

what is this amazing background music

Hey unbox therapy do a unboxing of samsung a10 i have one but for 150.00 not bad at all

What is that?Who is that?Is that a human ?Barley

I wish I had $150 to start withI would buy the UMIDIGI A5 Pro right nowIt&#39;s selling for $99 on AliExpress and only $17 to ship.

I have a Campbell&#39;s soup 1, two cans and a string you have to talk loud and the pictures suck, but not bad for the price.

What kind of music is he always playing in his reviews?

Continuously throwing thumbs down on ur videos , because i can see u are a con artist and show dude

Bought my wife and I an iPhone 6s through straight talk for 150 dollars a piece. Very solid phone and will be more than enough for us until we have the funds to upgrade and by that time the 7 or 8 will be 150$. 55$ a month for unlimited everything..not half bad when compared to the alternative

Hit like if you dont like the phone because of mediatek processor😃😃😃😃😃😃

Please unbox redmi note 7 please

Mine lg style 4

I prefer micro usb because everything I have has micro usb. Just having typ c for your phone is pointless

So now I know what that company that sponsors Valencia makes: crappy cheap phones lol

Still love Apple no matter what

A speaker on the back is a bad idea because when you out the case on it will block it

I would still rather keep my huawei y6 2019 which is cheaper than that phone and also much faster

This guy does his job right but he seems like he does this all the time with everything. Like imagine him dating someone and being like it’s not the best place to go out on a date but remember the price is $150 dollars for a date night🤦🏻‍♂️ just saying I don’t like watching his videos.

How much gb?? 64?? 32?? How much

Y&#39;all ever notice that like all the phones on Amazon never work for Verizon lol

Pece of junk don’t do that 150 you can get snapdragon chips huawei honor 8x looks like iPhone X max same looks like same screen size fingers full print full 1080 p screen 6.5 inches screen what could you moor u want u recommend pece sheet how much money blue pay you

itz now down to 129.99

Holy smokes...

Hey will you do the review of redmi note 7 pro

U just don’t like it cause ur spoiled boi

I love this phone

I had an R1 HD with Amazon ads and a Dash 3.5 years ago and it was great. BLU is a great brand.

It&#39;s now $129

<a href="">2:25</a> is wrong! MICRO-USB IS KING! If you think USB C is better than you just another sucker who got conned into buying a $$$ cord for ONLY your phone.

I LOVE THIS DUDE!!!!!!!!

Maybe apple can get some innovative ideas from this phone

The Lg Stylo 4 is $200 and its a good phone

BLU really trying hard to get their name in the number 10&#39;s now 😂 😂 😂... But what do i know, better late than never. Either way we&#39;ve known BLU for a while now... It&#39;s shit!!! I couldn&#39;t help mentioning. Lol 😂 😂

In future reviews it might be worth discussing weather the bloat can be easily removed, disabled or not disabled at all. On these budget phones, people really want to reclaim some of that on board memory and system memory from background running bloat.

Can someone tell me if Apple, Blu and Motorola ( owned by a chinese company) are the only cell phone manufacturers companies from USA?

Hello citizens of the land of peace,   Please do not buy Chinese phones and product. China showed aggression as their economy grows. China took over the South china sea islands which belong to other countries and international community. You don&#39;t want to support Chinese government. Buying Chinese product is supporting Chinese government indirectly.

Y9 2019

Oh hell nooo

It&#39;s 130 bucks right now. So go grab it or you&#39;ll miss the opportunity.

Fuck this one plus everywhere oneplus7 ads

Will this work with straight talk card

Please do a Samsung j6 plus review

I’m sorry but I cringed when he called storage memory.

Mine is a Lenovo K9 which I bought with around 7500 INR which is close to $100, It is much better than this.

Rather buy a second hand phone 🤔🤔🤔

Used the phone one step above this, the vivo xl + it&#39;s 50 bucks more but USB c. A nice build construction (the glass sandwich on most modern phones) and really good performance , obviously the camera is mediocre but for 200 bucks it&#39;s a fantastic device I often use in place of my s10 when I&#39;m bored!

My iPhone SE is $150.00 at Walmart

Or just go on eBay and get a used or refurbished pixel 2 or iPhone 6s that both destroy this in every category

For 150$ that&#39;s a good deal

The shittiest processor is helio processors

But why?The coefficient of linear expansion is the position of the haemoglobin in the atmosphere.But why? But why?full many a gem of purest serene lay underneath the unfathomed ocean unblossomed .but why? But why? 😂😂😂 Any mallus here?

just to be truthful here, its selfie is better than my LG V30&#39;s front camera.

Wait, why did he sound like kermet?

wish people went with this kind of phones instead of stupid expensive...this would make this phones more competitive price wise and model wise.

I got a Moto G6 for $150. I&#39;m happy.

Haha, looks a lot like a Huawei

You will get 5x more better spects in $150

Do ya know if this is available in the UK?

Then there are stupid people like me, I am the only one on planet Earth who buys an expensive smartphone and actually never uses any of the expensive features it has. I just watch youtube, snap a photo 5 times a year and make calls.

do a review on BLU R2 plus 2019

Holy smokes that&#39;s a cold day -6℃

Do the umidigi a3 pro

Do the thing

iPhone x clone

Helio p22 at 150$, in India we get same processor at 90$.
Redmi note 7 and redmi note 7 pro is much much better. I am writing on my 48mpbeast Redmi note 7 pro.

I just spent $180 on eBay to buy a Galaxy S8 with a light screen burn. Even with the burn, I would take an S8 over this phone any day.

Missed to say about fingerprint... 😈

Awsooooome phoneee

The helio processor isn’t that bad. The Alcatel 7 with the helio processor is pretty fast for a mediatek octacore

Watching this video made me appreciate my iPhone X so much more LOL can’t take these high price phones for granted

Body of poco f1

That phone has such a huge chin!...why is there a notch!?!?!

Just buy an a s8, it will still be better than this.

whats that music name chinese guy with blue eyes lol

<a href="">6:05</a> what jam is that?  I want to hear that beat.

Not worth the hassle just buy a one plus or a Poco phone.

RedMi 5 is better

I once bought a phone of only a hundred bucks

Can I have it pls I don&#39;t have 150 dollars

Blu products not reliable.

Umidigi A3 Pro......take the extra $60 and buy a bottle of Goose.

This is a huawei

No one: hThis guy: <b>Holy smokes</b>

Galaxy J6+

spend less and get more 😃😃

Can u play pubg mobile on this phone??

So far...( complete tone change) That was a little laggy 😂😂😂

Me: This phone is quite impressive for a vivoIt has a mediatek Helio P22&quot;I take back what I said,it&#39;s trash.&quot;

I&#39;ll buy this as my spare phone

Every phone you review is always GSM

Unbox Realme3 Pro
the notchparty suckz for 150 xD i rather pic the old design of smartphones ;)but a good phone, i would grab it without the notch :)

I had a blu phone.. it was cool but it keep breaking after a couple of months..

The only purpose I can think of for a phone jack, is to use an FM tuner.  But then, I&#39;ve never actually used the FM tuner on a smartphone.

It&#39;s not bad, I buy BLU FOR MY KID,  he is  not getting a 1000.00 phone!! He breaks everything!! Its perfect for a replacement when you break your 1000.00  phone and your under contract with no insurance!! Lol!! Replacement cost  at full retail...

<a href="">3:55</a> oh, it&#39;s got the ugly thing on top? changing video now...bye.

Android X
Now try Vivo V15 Pro! It&#39;s has the the similarly price but believe it or not, it performs as fast and maybe even faster than the iPhone X!

It&#39;s same price and almost same specs as Huawei Y6 well little bit cheaper......try the Asus Zenfone max pro M1/M2 They both have good speakers as well as a 5000mAh power for a cheap price of $320 USD approx....I prefer M2 if you got enough money

Now we contact Jerry for hardware testing 😏

look at umidigi one pro

wtf this is proof that the poor work 1000x harder and cater to everyones needs while the rich corporations remove every feature imaginable bc they want to show that they can afford everything

3gb Ram....nope not buying it

Still the same res as the XR

Check out Vestel smartphone. I am curious about what you&#39;ll say.

this channel is really a therapy to me, it put my life on stop for a moment. Its so entertaining

wait... so you&#39;re telling me that if a smartphone is unlocked, you can just slap a sim card into it and use it on any carrier? I thought you had to be within their approved phone lists to use a phone on a specific carrier

i want that phone now 😭😂

I own a vivo phone

I have this phone and you can choose to either include the top part of the screen or turn it off by sliding down the top left corner down. Also it has a dual Sim card slot, plus you can put a SD card

People who lost a phone might buy this to have some form of communicationtech for them to use.  As they say &quot;Better something than nothing&quot;

To my eyeballs

who else thinks this phone is trash

I have the Blu life Play 2 and on the box it says Stay Bold

The amazing redmi note 5 is near $150 in Amazon, and is completely better than that phone

they like it cuz it looks like an fake iphone 💀💀

Got my LG Stylo 4 on amazon unlocked
Xiaomi redmi 5 at that price point is good

Funny how you said that you Haven&#39;t seen wired earphones come packaged with a cellphone  in a long time.   I immediately thought of the S10 phones they all come with headsets and you just reviewed those a couple of weeks ago maybe? So maybe time is relative in the product review game?  hahahaha

I just checked &amp; this phone on Amazon costs around rs 3,500 in India which is less than 100 dollars

My realme 2 pro is better and cheaper

Most selling cuz most of us can&#39;t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on phone. We got rent to pay.

You should do the LG Stylo 4

Can see why it&#39;s the most popular. Want an iPhone XR? Want to save $600?Buy BLU Vivo, download Apple wallpaper and launcher

Huawei P Smart 2019 180$ posting this whit mine

What iPhone x🤔

But for £150 you can buy a used Samsung Galaxy S6 / 7 edge or for £220 you can find a used Samsung Galaxy S9 on Ebay or other sites right?

K

Well you are just paying 150 $ for this and if you pay 1000$ for a cell phone you expect to see 6 times more quality and performance?

<a href="">0:51</a> &quot;has the mediatek helio p22 processor&quot; scratches ear in disgust XD

I have the blu vivo XL plus and love it

Note 4 on Amazon is 120 bucks.  Problem solved.

id rather get 180 hot pockets tbh

I have this phone, never let me down, nice screen, great battery..luv it

Buy a redmi note 7 pro you wont regret it.

Lg g6 or q6

An lg stylo 4 is worth more in my opinion

what title of this music <a href="">6:09</a>

Pocophone...?

I love how he said &quot;extras&quot; for the power brick and earbuds instead of &quot;necessities&quot;. Nevertheless,great video.

blu is the worst ever dont even try to buy thisthey need to improve their quality in processor screen and camera etc too many software issues after a while of usagethey realy need to improve their quality

Can I have that phone 😂 I really need a new one 😅

Try the oppo f7 u r gonna love it 🔥🔥

Test the fingerprint scanner

Review the oukitel k8 which is around $150!

Unbox the redeem note for the 7
Have you seen the cubot phone on Amazon

Blu makes cigarettes not phones, if you are on a budget get a cheap Samsung. Not a phone from a company who doesn’t make phones

Its better than my iphone 5s

I have an iPhone 4 in 2019 almost anything is an upgrade

CAN it run MINECRAFT THO????

What is that?? Who is that?? Is it Human!!

The case talk really hit me... Couldn&#39;t agree more

What does &#39;unlocked phone&#39; mean ?

BLUB.itch L.ooksU.seless

I bought this and I&#39;m loving it. Thank you

This is why I am in love of vivo guysBut I got a iPhone 5 I think I&#39;m fine with that

If I had $150 I&#39;d go for the Mi A2 Lite... It has better display, better camera and direct updates from Google for 2 years.

What song was playing?. I love it

Do the blu r2 plus next

whats that song that u played

can u do a review on the blu vivo xI+

Not bad, but Ill stick with my Samsung

I&#39;m afraid to watch this because I just bought one

Audio is low volume.

Try the honor phones there the best cheap phones

&quot;You&#39;re just gonna slap your SIM in there and have a headphone jack, and you&#39;re gonna be okay. You&#39;re gonna be alright.&quot;I love you Uncle Lew xD

&quot;they&#39;re gonna give you a headset, a wired headset, oh my goodness! Haven&#39;t seen one of those in a box for a while&quot; and I&#39;m laughing my ass off, hand down the best joke of the year 😂😂🤣🤣Apple team be like: 😑Samsung and LG fans be like: 😊👍🏼

The phone has a notch setting to fix the placement works well surprising as a daily driver.

remember the price

150 dollar android smartphone: 2 cases and a quick charger

 + a screen protector

1000 dollar Iphone: No cases and no quick charger

 and defintely not a screen protector

Alrighty then Apple

I have this phone

Buy realme 3 its cheaper and it has helio p70 and 25mp front camera

The 2010 Toyota Camry of phones 🤷‍♀
does it work with verison???

I wish your reviews weren&#39;t so basic

It supports American LTE bands

I have the Vivo XI+. No complaints. It has real Face ID and I confuse the heck out of people because they think it&#39;s an iPhone X. The P60 is a snappy processor and I&#39;m running Android Pie as promised.

i would get a used s7

Oh yeah yeah

My 7 year old iPad 4 is faster and better in terms of everything.

<b>is that a human?</b>

When your reviewing Samsung m20

Cases come with these unkown brand phones because third party manufacturers don&#39;t bother making them (because addressable market is too small).

Waste

I enjoy the Blu vivo xl+ is the best phone Blu came out with .

Asus zenfone may be better
I need the best phone in the world so i can browse e-mails better.

Somewhat nice 😁😁
Was gonna get a Blu phone but was told that there is no customer service, if something goes wrong, you have to get a new phone.

Am I suppossed to see that text at <a href="">0:55</a>? :P

<a href="">6:54</a> Alita battle angle
Redmi Note 7 or Max Pro M2

Has anyone had problems with wifi? I saw critics in amazon who say that the phone does not connect to wifi and I am from Venezuela I can not have a phone without wifi and once I bought it I could not return it: / Has it gone well?

I purchased my LGV20 for less than 150.00  and added an extented battery, and case, and upgraded it to oreo...

I got my galaxy s7 new for 100 dollars

was that Lewis: Battle angel in that pic?

If I had $150 I&#39;d get a Xiaomi Mi A2/Lite

i would buy a note 7

I would have purchased the infinix note 5... It&#39;s pretty good

It depends on ur connection mine is really good so no lag and it is so beautiful to look at the game

COOL VIDEO

Would love to see a honor 8x video

For 150 I could get a Google Pixel for that price...

The battery lasts a long time on this phone if you aren&#39;t using it heavily. But does anyone know how to stop my Blu VivoXl4 battery from draining at a rate of 1 percent per minute when using YouTube?

The phone worked great until it needs to be updated, glitches will happen after a while.  BLU never provides any type of security patches or updates for their phones, giving them a short life span simply cause they start to glitch, and will eventually come out with another phone in 5 months to switch to.  It&#39;s really dissaponting, they do good work..

I have the blu Vivo 11, its one of the best unlock phone out there I am loving it.

BEST SELFIE TAKER EVER...LOL

What is the name of that music on soundcloud?

I got amazon adsAnd if i had a &quot;i&quot;I got amazon Aids

ASUS ZENFONE MAX PRO M2 IS MUCH BETTER 🚩
They just copied the look of an iPhone x

I got one of these phones

This looks better than my Samsung s5

Note 7 pro

150$ on reshmi note 4 is much worth it😐

Where were you Ravi Behl&#39;s brother from another mother..!

Watching this on my Motorola razr hot pink

the real me note 7 is better than that phone for 150$

Unbox Therapy Try OPPO A3S oR Vivo Y91

BLU are crap.... No customer support. Nonupdates no nothing.. Freezing all the time... Rebooting all the time....worst phones I ever used.

For just $70 more dollars you can get the OnePlus 5 on amazon like new condition

Less than a year after the iPhone X comes out, and $150 phones already have it&#39;s same design? Crazy.&#39;Cheap&#39; or budget phones are gonna be the new thing in the age of $1000 phones, mark my words..

You clearly haven&#39;t seen nor reviewed the Nubia M2 Global Version, give it a shot, I&#39;m sure you will be impressed, I own one and it&#39;s a SICK phone for 150 $!

i was just looking at this phone on amazon at random so i came to youtube to see the reviews.....think i might have to order

Please do a review on the lg stylo 4

Shorty face time me out the BLU!!!

You should review the vivo xl+ it&#39;s way nicer

What&#39;s the problem with micro USB

Does the blu vivo xl4 have gyroscope?

Watching this on my Blu Vivo XL4

I have that!!!

Do the p smart 2019 please!!!???

Hi there! I have been watching you&#39;re videos from the past four days and the thing is i wanted to buy a nokia 5.1 plus could you do a video for that or any other suggestions for meby the way love you&#39;re videos how you cooperate giving tons of  tips and tricks about new gadgets and stuff

I mean you can get a iphone 6s for like the same price or pay 20 more and get a 7

check out the lenovo k8 note it is cheaper. But don&#39;t know if it is available there.

I dunno why but everytime I see his videos, I crave to play resident evil 2

I actually got the Blu studio 2019 model for 79.00 USD at Best buy and it&#39;s been kicking ass. I been using BLU phone now for 4 years and I have gone thru 8 Blu phone broken screen glass you name it I have punished my BLU phones but heres the kicker I only have spent about 750.00 USD on all of my Blu phone. Compare to the note 4 I had before I paid 1000.00usd for it  a few weeks later i broke the glass &amp; screen mine you it&#39;s unlock they wanted 600.00usd to fix it.  WTF so i fix it alright went to Fry&#39;s on a different mission and came out with my first BLU phone  the studio 7.0 LTE 7&quot; screen that was 4 years ago. yes 7&quot; screen BLU been going big before apple &amp; Samsung. Once I got in my car and I fix my note 4 that day too by threw that shit out my window on the 110 fwy driver mad as hell seen there were phone cheaper and can do the same thing phone rings if I&#39;m need phone calls when I need something never again will I  spend more than 100.00 usd on a phone .

MediaTek is a fucking great processor family if you love randomly crashing games, especially when you&#39;re in first in multiplayer races on Asphalt.

Does it connect to metropcs

M20 is the best budget smart phone

I had a pink BLU life 8xl it was good for 6 months and then my mic started going out. The only way anyone could hear me is if I put it on speaker phone or yelled. My bro in law had one that was practically the size of a tablet and it was laggy, the screen cracked extremely easily, and again with the mic going out. They aren&#39;t great phones at all. I&#39;d go to a flip phone before going back to BLU.

Been using Blu phones since 2015, their only downturn is aftermarket support, as in, software updates, accesories, screen replacement and such (my screen broke in oct/2018). It was a pain in the ass trying to update my Studio X to Lollipop, rooting the device and installing a custom recovery. nonetheless, it was a great device for me, i&#39;m still using it up to this day.

Blu phones are good but their batteries suck

Low end Android phones are always a little laggy out of the box. They take a while to settle after the first start up. Actually high end phones probably do too but they have better hardware so it is not as noticable. It is pretty nice what you can get for $150 if you don&#39;t want to be a carrier&#39;s b**ch for 2 years. I buy flagships now (I am one of the aforementioned b**ches) but when I was slightly less poor than I am now, I had a lot of these low end phones. I got a Moto G for $199 back in 2013 and it was one of my favorite phones of all time.

Why do you test the camera always at the plant 😂

Am i first?
Only <a href="">3:50</a> in and I already want the phone

Burner phones just got classier, smoother, whiter, slimmer and eye enlargered. Bad guys never looked so classy.

I would buy a motorola

Thanks bro

holy smokes

how the hell does this have android 8.1 while my galaxy s7 doesn&#39;t yet

But can it run minecraft?

I pity people in the US for the lack of choices and being carrier locked. 😋Even Nokia gives USB cable, power adapter, a case, a pair of earphones in the box here in India.

Apple doesen&#39;t give you even a fast charging block

I don&#39;t know why .I ordered last night from Amazon and I didnt remember till the amazon notification this afternoon . Here 2morrow .   I hope is good  lol

Is it MHL compatible?

MI A2 lite is better than this

Am I the only one who hates him for being so photogenic?

I was looking at this but I went with the umidigi one max for $30 more. 128 gb rom and 4 ram sealed the deal.

$150? Hmmm I could get my self on a budget for $199 phone Asus zenfone max pro m2

If you put it on developer mode you can make the screen sliding faster

If you only had $150 to spend you should also check out the LE S3 by LeEcco. Specs are similar to this but better camera, battery and it&#39;s dual sim. Damn fine phone for around $125.

I have this phone it&#39;s fire

I love what ever you test on here.. You are a great vloger

I bought it and I love it..

am i the only  person who skipped straight to when he opened the box

Blu was my sh1t before I got a iPhone

Got my-self a Nokia 950XL..it&#39;s awesome

This is the phone I&#39;m getting most definitely

These kinda phones he reviews is like your first phone when you were 8.

Do not buy this. BLU has been caught with keyloggers in their software a numerous phones.

why dont any reviewers say what phone calls are like after all it is a phone

Well as I watch this video I have a Galaxy S8 that I&#39;m still paying for and it has a Samsung 8.0 operating system, the front facing camera on my S8 doesn&#39;t appear to be any better than this one, and as far as a notch goes I really don&#39;t care. A full disclosure I am 70 years old but I do use my telephone as a telephone. The camera is okay and I take a couple of shots but nothing extensive. I tap I swipe up I swipe down I swipe left and I swipe right it&#39;s all pretty much the same to me. I can tell you I will never walk into a Verizon Wireless store and pay a full-blown price for anything anymore after seeing this video. Oh and at 70 years old you really don&#39;t want to take selfies trust me.

I’m watching this on a blu vivo xl4

It&#39;s Amazon&#39;s #1 because companies like one I used to work with in Las Vegas.They would buy large quantity of blu phones and upsale them for $100 more.#1 customer was grandma buying 6 of them for her grandchildren.

Watching this on my mate 20 Pro

I have 2 of them and im gonna tell you right now.... THIS PHONE DOESN&#39;T LAG AT ALLL NEVER HAS AN APP FORCECLOSED RAN DUAL 4G NO PROBLEM... RAN ANY HIGH GRAFFIC GAME I INSTALLED WITH EASE.... LONG STORY SHORT BUY 1... AND OHHH THE DUAL 13MP CAMERAS ARE EXCELLENT!

Blu phones are ass....

Totally something I would of loved before I adventured into the mid to high spec phone range 😂... My daily driver is now the p20 Pro ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love it so much x

Nokia x5 is much better

Please try the Blu vivo xl plus

Dope video. Love the channel. Please share the link to the music you played when you were testing out the speaker of the phone?

moto x4 $140

Pay 150..i mean....1500$ instead and buy a high end, last years tech iPhone :-)Or use the money to get away on vacation and disconnect ;-)

I can not go back to blu

No match for Redmi note 7

Buy a pocofone f1 murican folks. Or wait for the Mi9.. You&#39;ll see what the term &quot;value for money&quot;  means

Oh 150

How much did you get it
That chin tho

Does the phone have nfc?

I have the phone

it isn&#39;t bad at all for that price

Copy of Redmi Note 6 pro from front side

I bought one for my friend and she loves it. I personally have the Blu Vivo XI+ 6gb-128gb version

<a href="">1:18</a> <b>SAMSUNG GALAXY M STUFF</b>  did u just leak the new name of the new galaxy

oppo a3s is the best

Redmi note 7 will be better choice

Something else!

I can get sony xperia z5 premium than that phone 🤔.. or the other chinese phone hmm

Hey the link to the phone has a notch this is the wrong phone..

i thought that was a condom box at first

Did he just sang Dean Lewis - Be alright?

Watching this on my BLU Vivo XL4 😁

Sir how much phone do you have

U rich buy a real plant!!! Lol

Can you review the BLU VIVO XI+ which is a bit more expensive at 300 dollars.

So will you guy&#39;s be unboxing the bestselling adult section of Amazon also?

I bought this for Christmas. My LG Optimus G Pro (LG E980) was on its last legs. It served me well (5yrs). There is a learning curve obviously but nothing too crazy. It is stock android. I am loving this new phone. it serves the purposes I need from it. The price point and its features were a big draw. I don&#39;t play intense games or watch videos on my device so the screen resolution is fine for me. The camera serves its purpose. Overall ... really good budget phone.

Nova 4

Omg when I saw the thumbnail I was like IPhone X? Then I saw the video and I was like it looks like the IPhone X. Then I was like “Did they copy from the design of the XR? Cause of the pixelation like the XR.” It does sort of look like it.

The turn off bout this phone is that it&#39;s not type C an has no wireless charging

Will it work with Verizon in the USA?

I&#39;d spend a few more bucks and get a refurbished s7 active

3 things that I don&#39;t like abt this phone:1) Can&#39;t remove Google search bar2) LED light does not blink when there r notifications and when phone is idle (tried downloading other apps but to no avail)3) Only available LED light is white, whereas other phones allow diff customisation of colors for group and personal msges.

Not a fan of blu and never will be

Something else like the Motorola phones are better.

<a href="">3:12</a> Huawei does
the box looks like pat mcgrath lab makeup

Why is this sh!t on my recommended?

My ZTE zmax pro($100), was better than Moto e5 plus!!!!!!!!!($179)!!!!!!!

Motorola is shit!!!!!!!!

Actually, 271 ppi is not that far from iPhone XR&#39;s 326 ppi LCD screen :)

Just pulled the trigger. We shall see!

I would by umidigi one

Why read the specs? Can&#39;t you just do them as an on screen graphic. Listening to you read might be considered value-detracted. I know I know. Nobody made me watch.

Make a video on how to pair air pods to a android

This  box look like parfume box

Don&#39;t smash the stuff on table man like you did with those earphones

Remove the f*** bgm 🤦🤦😈
What&#39;s the name of that ringtone at <a href="">6:07</a>

That box is dope

Yeehaw

FIRST SONG NAME?

Hey can u check out zenfone 5z??
I just spend 100+ tax a a temporary phone at Walmart. I&#39;m mad af.

IDK TBH

Make this ur main driver

Why don&#39;t you actually test phone on how it makes phone calls? I know crazy idea...

Can someone please tell me the intro song name

I wish you would find budget phones that can work with Verizon or Sprint lol

I'm Mexican Put the Subtitles in Spanish please!
Man, are you one spoiled bitch

Really?? @ <a href="">5:29</a> he says like ONEPLUS 6 T??. Not even close, but a nice mention anyway.. pS. I&#39;m watching on OnePlus 6T

The heck are all these oh yeah yeah comments

BLU have traditionally made reasonably specced phones at decent prices, glad to see they are still maintaining that concept.

Used S8

I would prefer something of Redmi, Meizu or Realme for that price. And I&#39;ve bought a Chinese smartphone by Lenovorola (Motorola by Lenovo) for only $99 bucks (Moto G5S XT1799-2 aka Moto Green Pomelo) with 4Gb of RAM, 32Gb of storage, FullHD display and metal case (is this Blu made of metal?). No options for this amount of cash

take the case. its on the house

I have had this phone for about 2 months now and it&#39;s great for the price replaced an iPhone 6splus and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m missing anything

First song name???

As usual, no one cares about &quot;bloat ware&quot; as much as these reviewers or the &quot;stock experience&quot;

Bro...Do some stuffs with Samsung M20....Please...

Can you unbox jio phone 2
whats the difference between this and the Vivo XI?

Bruuuh the box’s design, has been my phone background for over a year now and I had no idea it was from this 😂🤦🏻‍♂️

What kind of knife was that?

I will buy it

Canadian amazon*

On Amazon these phones have hardly any ratings?

I just got mine tonight And it rocks man I love it for 119 at Amazon is really great ain&#39;t paying 1000 dlls for a phone I got a laptop and a phone for less than 500 bucks

I&#39;m watching this on my pocophone f1 :p

For the price it puts Apple to shame

the actual phone that I&#39;m watching this on.

why not do a review on the Blu Vivo XI+ ?

Bought it!

I&#39;ve been an iPhone user for awhile but most of my work stuff and game dev stuff involves android and google therefore I&#39;ve been considering going back to android which is what I first started on. I&#39;m pretty fed up with every year the cost of iphone going up and up and up, give it another 5 years and it&#39;ll be a 5k dollar iphone at some point granted you get what you pay for but I don&#39;t really feel like the yearly upgrade timeframe for the cost of an iphone is worth it anymore even though the quality is there its just getting way out of hand.

I use this phone as my daily, $129 and very great specs! 8 core cpu mediatek helio p22 and 3gb of ram and android 8.1??? I will take it! And it even comes with AI! And most games run fine! Great for casual gamers!Plus BLU emailed me and said that it will update this phone!

Take a case...it’s on the house

When I first bought this phone, I gave it to my grandma. She&#39;s happy with it.

Redmi Note 7

on Amazon....on Word Wide? Poco

Can you please do a comparison between this and the Elephone A5 - which also has Android 8.1 and yet is not Lag-ville, thanks

<b>oh yeah yeah</b> I would

For ppl who just wanna say 💭 they have a big screen smartphone. I&#39;ll stick with my LG V40

Must be cheap all the way around

Better buy poco f1

Rebranding Chinese phones
Its the best selling because of broke

Came here for the phone, stayed for the charismatic guy🙌

Nahhh for 150$ i prefer mi familiy
I remember my blu xl2. People saw it and said “what the heck is that garbage” now blu is a semi stable company in rising. I AM A FOREFATHER OF THIS COMPANY

Can you pls send me blackshark or  Poco f1

mediatek helio p22 is best in class mobile SOC for a budget device.There might be a optimization issue with the software the processor is quite good.

<a href="">6:52</a> Is why every will come here again and again 😂😂😂

Specification of these phone is so bad. I am from India and u can get much better phone in these price

Bro I need a phone any phone realme or iPhone or Samsung bro plz help me I am making my YouTube channel plz help me I am waiting for your reply

When a girl asks me to describe myself <a href="">7:55</a>

Hmm this or the G6 play

Your review on this was crap!!!!Acting like a Tech hater cause its not apple.   Unsubscribing cause your a bitch but ill check back for the music.

Mi a2 lite

This phone highlights the fact that people doesn&#39;t need high end phones anymore.

I own this phone and love it. I don&#39;t have surplus cash to spend on a smart phone and I scored this bad boy for a hundred bucks on Amazon. Near stock android, bright screen,decent resolution and  a sufficient camera. I dtched the transition animations and now it runs butter smooth. Great deal all in all.

BLU has a problem where the charging port suddenly stops working and the chargers break very easily

Bought my lg g6 for 150 and it doesnt slow tf down after 6 months. Every Blu phone ive owned starts great but deteriorates within months performance wise. It gets to a poimt where you cant even realistically search the internet

Blu is a vape brand

I like the blu lx 4 i would  spend 150 dallors   on it

emm turned out to be vivo
I was gonna get this phone but then got the umidigi one max, you should review that phone

On the strength of this review I took a chance replacing my older Iphone 5S.   This phone is like a Ferrari compared to the older Apple.   Thanks Bud for taking the time to review it, I def can dig getting for 1/8th the price of some of the more pricey stuff!   I&#39;m excited about it, great product so far!

Honor phones are better...

Slamming the phone around

wow! that phone has the same price as an airpod!

for 150 i dont know how you beat it, id of course get my own case that thing is gross.. nice looking phone though.. i vowed to never go over 200 after all the broken phone mishaps in my life. i hope this isnt the next one. rip you other little buddys

My question is should I stay with the Galaxy s7 or buy the phone in the video?

I&#39;m Allways surprise how tech geeks don&#39;t seems to understand the needs of the mayority of the world

Can we stop with phones on every video. Let’s do other gadgets. I want to buy other gadgets not just phones.

In India, this is terrible value for money. You will get much more for $150-60

I hate how all the new androids are trying to look like iPhone X

Oh no no
With 150$ I would buy an iPhone... wuuups wrong timeline :o

I just went to go buy one of these the other day lmao

Oh Yeah Yeah
Did Lew even test the fingerprint scanner

Lots of.......... Holy smokes

Make a Video on Nokia 5.1 plus. Rs.9999 on flipkart

Dude is super critical, and condescending as fuck, maybe reviewing too many rich products has clouded his mind. He probably forgot the &quot;working class&quot;, I work for my money, and there is no way I am going to spend 1 grand for a fuckin phone. I know, that if you want to show off, then that&#39;s your thing, cool. But I want a product that works well, and is at a reasonable price. This is why this phone is best selling on amazon, so why the hate. Late.

This

150$ and a worst mediatek p22 processor ... Even with import duty ... U seriously need to visit India or China &quot;alone without saying your YouTuber friends&quot; or anyone spreading anything over internet. Trust me in that. You will find or discover something beyond Poco f1 sd845 in 150$. I need you to know our Indian top YouTubers know like 1% of total tech sold and price ratio to tech sold in whole India.

i swear you hate everything

I just bought this 🤭

What do thing about the new vivo 2019 apex

redmi note 7 pro

Blu is shit

better than samsung&#39;s or LG&#39;s budget phones. Motorollas are good but their exterior designs feel cheap and very dated

Oh yeah yeah

Less lag than the V20 I&#39;m still nexting off with AT&amp;T.. Bet I&#39;m still not down to $150 on this bag of fuck LG. Also didn&#39;t realize you were Alita: Battle Angel, you just ruined that movie.

Honor v20 pls?

Huawei P smart
That&#39;s what I&#39;m using right now 😂

Root it, delete bloatware and install Nova launcher. Disable transition effects and enjoy your great 150 USD phone.

I dig it!
xioami

Not nice
<a href="">3:46</a> can we just admire how perfectly he threw that back in there

this phone became the best selling &quot;after&quot; this video..

Pocophone!

where are my brothers?

oh yeah

Oh yeah yeah

Oh yea

Jsks

yall are spoiled, i gotta 40 android phone

Right now I&#39;m using a moto E4 and if I had the update will have to be a Moto E5 ☺

Lew i challenge you to make it as your daily driver...

He’s unboxed multiple BLU products yet is still surprised by the screen protector

I just got the Samsung Galaxy J7 Refine. It&#39;s priced close the one reviewed in this video and it has a 5.5 inch HD TFT Display,  3,300mAh Battery 13MP Main &amp; 13 MP Front Cam,  32GB ROM/ 2 GM RAM,  1.6GHz Octa- Core Processor, 4G LTE Plus w/2x20 CA &amp; HPUE, Mobile HOTSPOT. It Even has &quot;Picture in Picture&quot; say you are watch a video and a text cam in you could still watch  without stop your video!

anyone have this phone wondering if I could play an rug game on here

in portugal an european nation where the average wage is around 800 euros this is not so cheap! :)

I just realized you always have a hat on.

Vernee X for US $130, but Vernee Mix 2 is not a bad choice for US $102, both on Aliexpress. Vernee X is thicker than Mix 2, but it&#39;s a good phone.

stop reviewing unaspirational shit
Love the  background music

U fucking annoying yank. I wanted to watch this but your voice goes through me like your mom

The &quot;I don&#39;t want a phone&quot; Phone

Whats that song name lew always plays on phone?

Long live Xiaomi

i had a BLU phone in the past and it simply stop working after 1 month and the warranty didn&#39;t apply because they said it was supposedly my fault. so be careful with this brand. i mean this happened to me like 5 years ago but it is good to know.

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
please review the ulefone armor 3

Bush did 9/11
Nokia 5.1 plus is way better than this with android one..🙄

My 1st phone was a blu dash c music
