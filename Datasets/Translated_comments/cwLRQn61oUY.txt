I don&#39;t know why 2 hot chicks fighting is so awesome. Sorry, not trying to offend anyone, but you know Demi had that in mind when she collaborated with Michelle on this video. I&#39;m not alone, right? Haha. I love it!

I used to have the biggest crush on Demi. I feel bad for her mental health. She‚Äôs an amazing singer and actress. I think if she wouldn‚Äôt have given up acting because of the mental health she would have been a A list actor easy and obviously she‚Äôs a top notch singer.

She needs to be in the movies

 <b>a u t h e n t i c v i e w s</b>  and Demi Lovato the duo making virals

I just noticed that Michelle Rodriguez who plays Letty in Fast and Furious is in this!! Wow after all these years!

Its March 2024, let&#39;s see how many legends are listening to this incredible song

Who&#39;s here 2024

I listen to this song when I need confidence.This song gave me the confidence to do what I love and it helps me remember my mom that passed away.

Letty from fast and furious
yasssssss girllllll yaasssssssssss- juliet
‚ÄòHow do you ignore disrespectful comments and let their creative servants and parents sort out the problem?‚Äô

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and ‚ÄúClover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy‚Äù are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

This song makes me punch someone who hurt me

This is my favorite music
The song should be called arrogant.

I came here for the ballerina movie looking for the song 

I love this

The only thing missing was Torreto appearing at the end of the video kakak
Cops tho. I&#39;m microchipped in my ears. 3 n half years ago in my Brigham city apartment and Felix,s trailer. Done in my sleep  YouTube. Talent. And me talking a whole lot of shit.

<b>A u t h e n t i c V i e w s D a w  t C a w m</b>  and Demi Lovato are a match made in heaven, Best song on album this song  

Am I the only one search underrated  I wondering this wouldn&#39;t pop us

This so wrong, but some people purport this idea. Claiming to be slaves etc. I call bs. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt do informants

When this song plays, all I think about is the movie: The Ballerina

Taken out the elsing priority it isn&#39;t a concern being unawared.things may bring disastors but it&#39;s revolved hope that bestills chance.meant inclusions are the deficits of joy yet merging beginnings start at where you&#39;ll least expect them .the mere predicaments of life places us with coming devotion. noting how much life presumes your more beworths at competing through exulted changes .it&#39;s the primary development that centers a role unlike most favors .we carry a long burden supposing doubts .but the only concern that really apprehends us is knowledge .

Meeting with Saint Santa Claus, Christmas Mail, workshops on creating Christmas tree decorations and gingerbread decorations, creative games in the elf factory, and finally a concert of Christmas hits. December in P√≥≈Çnocna promises to be magical! In his busy schedule, St. Nicholas found time to visit P√≥≈Çnocna and listen to the wishes of the visiting children. He will sit on his majestic throne surrounded by cheerful elves and meet the youngest. Visiting children will be able to tell him about their dream gifts, and after an exciting conversation, they will receive diplomas confirming this unique visit and sweet gifts. This is the only chance a year to meet a special guest from the North Pole!Meeting with Saint. Santa Claus: December 6 (Wednesday), 3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. Christmas Post Office and workshopsWho missed the meeting with St. Nicholas? Santa, don't be discouraged! A letter written on Christmas stationery, carried by the magical wind, will surely find its way to the addressee, who is probably already preparing a reindeer cart. Our Christmas Mail will help a little with this. The letter is ready, so you can start the pre-Christmas preparations: together we will create decorations and decorate the gingerbread cookies. Nothing creates atmosphere better than decorating baubles together, which will later be hung on the home Christmas tree. Did anyone mention gingerbread? Yes! They will be there too! Workshops on creative icing of scented gingerbread under the supervision of experienced artists will help children create unique, Christmas patterns. But we cannot guarantee whether the gingerbread will survive uneaten until Christmas. ;)Christmas Mail and workshops: December 6‚Äì10, Wed.-Fri. 15.00-19.00, weekend 12.00-19.00 Elf Factory At this time of year, the factory works at top speed to provide toys for every child. Maybe it's worth helping the elves? Visit the Christmas factory and learn how to make the most beautiful decorations and unique toys in a winter atmosphere. A snowman, a snow globe, an atmospheric lantern, recycled Christmas tree decorations, and for special recipients - greeting cards. Skillful and resourceful elves will help you with everything. The elf factory will have all the necessary materials, so the only limitation is the imagination of the youngest. Join the elves to prepare for the holidays as best as possible!Elf Factory: December 13‚Äì17, Wed.-Fri. 15.00‚Äì19.00, weekend 12.00‚Äì19.00 Concert of Christmas hits The most popular Christmas hits will be played with fragrant gingerbread and surrounded by atmospheric decorations: All I want for Christmas is You, Snowman, Underneath the Tree, Santa tell me, Rockin' around the Christmas Tree or Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Almost everyone knows the words to these songs and they will certainly make many people sway to the rhythm of the joyful sounds. The concert in P√≥≈Çnocna will make pre-Christmas preparations more pleasant, and the holidays are getting closer! Christmas concert in P√≥≈Çnocna: December 17, at 2.00 p.m. All events take place on the ground floor - next to the Christmas tree house, next to the Super-Pharm drugstore. We invite the youngest and older ones to take part in pre-Christmas preparations with P√≥≈Çnocna! GREAT CHRISTMAS PARADE Date added: November 30, 20239 DECEMBER at <a href="">12: 00</a> ‚Äì <a href="">18:00</a>On this day, the streets of our shopping center will be taken over by elves, gifts, stars, reindeer and costumed people in costumes inspired by Christmas traditions. There will also be a Grinch, but he won't spoil anyone fun, because Saint himself Santa Claus will keep you in a happy mood! There will be jugglers, mimes and even a dumpling with borscht! Plus great live music performed by the DrumBastic orchestra! In addition, there will be face painting stations for all children and refreshments with cotton candy! Zones open from <a href="">12:00</a> - <a href="">18:00</a>. The parade sets off at designated times, encouraging everyone to join the fun crowd!

See you at Promenada on December 9! See you!

Ôªø18Ôªø Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

I love this song 
I kinda wish this was a action movie it would be so cool I bet they could have done a lot more action seens

I got the chills when they showed eachother the BS arm stamp.. I feel like it was saying &quot;wake up,  ladies!!&quot;

My name is   DEMIyeah she does and my mum out there

This is the best music video i have ever seen

forgiveness of God......
Carol can you make sure demi is at the next heartventure event which is I believe is on 7 of October,  I have just passed my lionesses training which means  I get to play in euros world cup Olympics  I will  only be away for couple of months and hopefully come back with gold medal and the euro pean cup ,. I will away October 13 until November 22 probably because were flying back from Norway which means to get back to England were going to need to make to extra catch plane from Norway to Germany from Germany catch a plane to England  were leaving Norway on the 18 of October but stop overs could   it could another 5 days before I land

Carol maybe I&#39;m moving a bit to fast for demi likening but in view that penny has now broken off our marriage that we were supposed to have next year ,. I would like to offer demi my hand in marriage, as being her husband I give some time think it over she dosent have to make her dission right now just let know what answer is thank you ,.

My favorite thing about this is the accuracy of Michelle Rodriguez constantly winning the fights cause we all know there‚Äôs no way Demi could take her no matter how awesome she is

Residents of marginalization
september 2023?

If this happened to me. (Being in a maximum security prison and used to capture someone) that flashlight ain&#39;t doing anything to wake me up

I feel like this is the song I mostly relate to cause I was trying to get the other girl caught by joining them and then she fought me and at the end we looked at eachother&#39;s wrist to see the same birth mark and we fought the guys who let us fight at the first place and we bacame friends at the end  after that incident this song is made it was like in 2014 at November 25

Looks like something outta a fast and furious movie

Hey is that letti from fast and furious

Totally kickass. Two powerful hotties taking over corrupt men? Absolutely

I sing and listen to this song 24\7. It makes me feel like I can do anything! I struggle with some stuff and this song lights my fire! Thanks Demi!

Remember watching this when it first came out lol

WOW its good
I LOVE YOU

The part where it‚Äôs like I run this show is like‚ÄçÔ∏è

This makes me feel like girls can do anything because boys bully girls because they think their stronger no your not

Looks like a film by Robert Rodriguez 
I love this song

This song makes me feel like I&#39;m a strong independent woman and I love

THIS SONG IS SO AGGRESSIVE PLEASE DON&#39;T LISTEN TO IT

This is definitely Katniss‚Äô song !!

Lawd what&#39;s happening

Grandma Deimi Lovato retired black fan from Bahia
The Book of Eli, Eli knows tomorrow is going to be hard day exploring Fallout 76 bridges. He makes some dinner, listens for a music but wakes up with the discharged Ipod. Avoiding trouble that is not yours is your survivability - most times you aren&#39;t strong 1 vs 10 as monster hunter. He comes to a town to find somebody who can charge it for him, barters and makes a deal to wait two hours. Waiting in the bar ends up with a bar fight, but avoiding trouble gives him a chance to meet Solara, who will be serving him his water and filling his flask.

Is it just me or does this look and sound like a trailer for a movie? I would totally watch it...

Ok im a little suprised no doubt but i would express whoa time out because i did mention how peculiar all else first loves at least met up spoke but i as of now guess that she is giving me common courtesy of letting me know hey MB. What does make you really believe that I dont want to speak with you especially knowing who you are how much you have matured??? I don&#39;t know what more i can say until if this my first love trust believe i have nothing but the best interests of us both in my heart.

I wanted a film about them, I love Michelle Rodrigues too
400 MILLION

Am I the only one who thinks go Letty from fast and furious

I want old demi back 
 LOL
&quot;Story interpreting Lack of Thirstfulness.&quot;

I literally watch this and heart attack. I love this girl!

Nothing wrong with being confident

It so nice

I love this song

This song makes me feel confident

With Michelle Rodriguez I thought it was a fast and furious music video 

AAA LET DO VELOZES FURIOSOS A MELHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR MUDOUUU NADA &lt;3

It&#39;s the lady from the fast and furious movies

This is Lety from fast and furious 
She must be the coolest girl in the world but... no man in sight

How many years pass, but I will never forget this song 

I just realized...maybe just maybe....Thank you demi, I appreciate and value your time.

I&#39;m pretty confident that anytime Michelle Rodriguez shows up in your video, someone is going to get an ass whoopin&#39;.

Years will pass and this will be my favorite demi
the rage of demi lovato was no match for the awesomeness that it Michelle Rodriguez

The first time I ever heard of this music is from Happy Death Day

Music hit another level...

Vsfd, that's a hymn
Mt bom...
Everybody listening??
This deserved a billion views

I know, Demi Lovato is a great singer, but for this song she would have to be stronger (song is not for her): She&#39;s drowning!

Point in no return yea right

&quot;So you say I&#39;m complicatedThat I must be out my mindBut you&#39;ve had me underrated&quot; 

Go girl. 2023...

Oh I knew this song because of the movie balerina

ugh michelle and demi are both so hot in this, baby gay me agreed to that certainly even 8 years ago

This should have been a full movie

I love this song so much I listen to it every day every evening and day I love it so much 

August 2023???
I watch this video alot- for no other reason than watching MRod looking bored while her crew tries to defeat Demi

What‚Äôs wrong with being cofedenttt

Bro I love Demi lavato but my parents don‚Äôt

Cool they added a character from fast and furious

The song makes me feel strong and fearce

this is my enemies to lovers queer action movie

DESSERVE TOP 10 ON BILLBOARD HOT 100

I‚Äôm telling u, this is the shit guys listen to when the homies aren‚Äôt around.

Why Demi didn&#39;t make anymore movies.... she clearly can be an action star too.... i love her.

Having miss loreta in this was a power move demi

From The Movie  Leap

Those 95k dislikes most from people who are insecure about confident people.

Happy birthday to you Demi Lovato 31 years ago 1992-2023

Happy birthday to you Demi Lovato 31 years 1992-2023
This song reminds me of Poppy Balfour/ Da&#39; Neer

After 7 years.. 2023 ok? This role is still one of the most b3a2hs tops
Hey demi, it&#39;s very unlikely your gonna see this but my dance club is using this song for our dance routine, it&#39;s helped so many kids feel more confident and strong. Thank you

Michelle Rodriguez... OMG... She&#39;s so fucken hot!!! Girl crush big time...
Bro I remember when I was like 7 or 8 I used to ‚Äúfight‚Äù to this song and force my dad to watch me 

My favorite action star Michelle Rodriguez
this shoulda been a movie

Similar energy to Can&#39;t Be Tamed

This isn't even music. IT'S ANTHEM
Almost at the end at <a href="">2:26</a> did I see what I think I saw the Wednesday actor I am a big fan of her and you too

The Rock Version of this song is OUT NOW!!

Me after listening this song: Feelingbadass like a diva

When I went to Philly 4th of July to see her perform best time of my life

Confident rock is the first rock version that has made me love it more than the original, the rock version of it is just great

Strong Gorgeous Independent Women 
Is this an actual movie? I need it

Who is here after demi released the rock version of this song? .

I love this song it makes me feel CONFIDENT (which I&#39;m not)!!!!

Michelle Rodriguez is my baby
Ballerina 
Give a soul
THIS HERE HAS NO ERRORS, DEFECTS, NOTHING!
Ya mom

This clip always gave me goosebumps
I‚Äôm Confident in myself
All it takes is one if a bresa colaca demilavato

Beautiful brave soul. All of her songs are fiery, she is full of talent and passion. 
<a href="">1:24</a>

Mm
For the year of the king, the same is given to him

Kept for a special occasion

I love  this song  it gives  me confidence

ummm okay?
Demi Lovato or not... Picking a fight with Michelle Rodriguez is a bad Idea.

I don&#39;t get how the convict theme of the video goes with the song. Clearly, these two women have a lot of problems, especially of the legal variety, but confidence is not one of them.

My parents  would be watching  this a million  times of only this song was a movie called confiden

I remember exactly where I was when this dropped

Nice clip no more
I am here for Frank Lapidus lmao

I was obsessed with this song when I was little but It was just because I‚Äôm bi, this should‚Äôve been a sign from the first time I saw it

Sorry for the long wat girl

No this is out cantest you cant arrest her for the video she star actress  vocalist singing

Do you got proph in forensic files

And I, like you, the same given to you no less than more

Whose time is yours or mine, how do you love me? The truth and the orphan were hidden by you and our true God

And I&#39;ll tell the truth and I&#39;m going for our father to die first remember you that mno hahhh

I hate games I&#39;m going with the truth yours and my message on hahh your you know

Your dead and God has kept for you an equal opponent for you I am made learned by two masters

And you are not a confidant, believe me, because I am learned from two sources

For some reason when I think of this song I think of the lyrics saying  so you say I‚Äôm constipated!

Demi your music is the best,My favorite singers are you Ava max and Billie Eillish .I hope ur not rivals

Never saw this video.  I like.

the song isnt that great, but this music video is such an awesome storyline compared to what usually happens in these! if this was a movie id go see it, the entire thing has such natasha romanoff vibes.a) i take the part about the song not being good backb) she literally uses nats move oh my GOD

Love it...
Demi basically summarised a movie in a three min vid

She is very talented no matter what they say about her I will always admire her...
I love this song , every time I listen to it I remember the ballerina movie
1 John 4:16- God is Love and whoever Lives in Love Lives in God and God in them.

They didn‚Äôt show her taking the bus guards gun because they knew she‚Äôd be dead better she got the gun lol

This is one of my favorite  songs

Congratulations Michelle Rodriguez the movie Terminator Hidden Fate
Michelle Rodr√≠guez the movie (Fast and Furious, Fast and Furious Uncontrolled, Fast and Furious 6, Fast and Furious 7 Fast and Furious 8 and Fast and Furious 10) 
Michelle Rodr√≠guez is an actress 
Fast and Furious 50: The Feminist Era
I really need a rock version of this song please Demi make my wish come true 

im gonna say it cus no one else will. the FACT that demi was able to team up with MICHELLE RODRIGEZ in a music video makes demis holllywood status skyrocket

That&#39;s the girl from fast n furious

Demi getting beaten by lety hahaha
Nothing

When i turned on the transcript it was in Chinese or japan not english lol

Mt bom...
Everybody listening???. 
Demi and Mitchel together please
Michele Rodrigues is incredibly beautiful
This needs to be a movie

The truth is, Kennedy Holmes' version is much superior to this little voice.
Point in no return Brigit floda it a movie come out 1997 I think

Whats wrong with being confident?

My friend‚Äôs walk slow like me and my friends are killers

If girls will girls can

You&#39;re came back from the philly concert aren&#39;t you?-

I feel very sigma when i listen to this

Perfect for when you get stuck in a time loop

In this video, why are there several people in this video always fighting together? Always beating one person after another.
This video looks a bit scary
In this video, why does the singer have a somewhat red mark on the woman's arm?
In this video, why do several women fight together in this video and always hit one woman after another?
In several parts of this video there is this woman who is always kind of falling over
In one part of the video, there is this woman using a pen to sign a single word, and then immediately throwing the pen on the table.
A couple of women fighting together in this video looks a bit scary and weird.
In this video one of the guys prints a mark that looks like a little red on the singer's arm on this woman's arm
I always listened to this song when I was little
MARKO ZAROR IS IN THIS VIDEO  @<a href="">1:35</a>
Michelle Rodriguez is such a badass
I JUST LOVE THE CLIP AND THE SONG! DEMI YOU ARE PERFECT

FREE WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE I AM COOL FOR THE SUMMER!!! (11-11)
 Amazing! If u knew, they used this song in ‚ÄúBallerina‚Äù for the last part ‚ÄúThe Dance Battle‚Äù. Im so glad you have this amazing and satisfying song in the world 

This song makes me feel like a strong and independent woman but im a non-prouns

I still love this song

There&#39;s a company that makes the most high quality one off bikes in carbon fiber rod look and I think they should make the most high quality GTC-900. It&#39;s like ten times thicker three times lighter frame to vibrate made by bot.

My favorite part is:: q:09
DEMI I REALLY WANT TO GO BACKWARDS AND REVERSE THAN FORWARDS BECAUSE I PREFER THE OLD DAYS BETTER THAN THE NEW DAYS BECAUSE THE WAS NO CORONAVIRUS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT CORONAVIRUS HERE IN THE NEW DAYS AND I DON&#39;T LIKE THE CORONAVIRUS I HATE THE CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE CORONAVIRUS IS THE WORST NOBODY LIKES THE CORONAVIRUS THEY HATE THE CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE CORONAVIRUS IS THE WORST AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE OLD DAYS BETTER THAN THE NEW DAYS AND SOME OF THEM LIKE THE NEW DAYS BETTER THAN THE OLD DAYS AND IT&#39;S TRUE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND THE OLD DAYS ARE FUN FOR ME BUT HERE IN THE NEW DAYS ARE BORING FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND I DON&#39;T LIKE IT AT ALL I HATE IT.

I&#39;m both my dad&#39;s and mom&#39;s daughter

I&#39;m naturally feminine but I also like to let out my tomboy side

hi beautiful ‚ñº

She really goooood actress 

It‚Äôs funny how the girl she‚Äôs beefing with is hotter than her 

Already 500 million views on Spotify, now to take it to 500 here on YouTube
I remember that we were watching TV with my little brother and they played this song and he really liked it because of the video because he didn't know that we women could fight or be that strong (so to speak) xd
Beautiful empowered Demi and Michelle Rodr√≠guez truly loved you!! I admire your talents
playing this for marching band and it makes me feel confident

She proved that girls and woman Ô∏è can fight 

Thank you Demi for this song and for sharing your talents and so many of your songs! Life can be tough, but we can be tougher through choosing to love ourselves and others. Sending love your way

This song is the best

I don't know if I paid attention to the music or the video lol for Tao bom, it could even create a movie
Hdhwhejyudhhsdjiebhxhdnd
The captions are fucking hilarious.

Demi Lovato is the best of the world of Pop Music Made in USA! 

7 years later and I still love this song

I always imagine myself having a y/n moment whenever I hear this song. Yep, I said it. It‚Äôs just that empowering.

Sdds this phase from Demi 
I have the impression that this song is in a series or a film, but on my way there I saw a comment that I have already seen so I tell myself that I just might be already seen the clip
I came to watch this video, just to see Michelle Rodriguez kicking her a.s.s.

841 days left in my orginal countdown for when The Large Red Dragon takes over Ohio. 849 days till we are microwaved by them in Kansas, sorry Toto and Dorothy. Those red slippers won&#39;t help here. I told you.

I remember this song back then and still listening to it today

Demi is sugary and sexy all over.

This is so cool !!!!!! 
sexist

There&#39;s a lot wrong with being constipated,  you should so go get it checked out than write a song about it

The music video reminds of the fight between Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez in the Resident Evil Retribution.

I decree that in 20 years this song will continue to be remembered 
Full of hate and a shitty fucking playlist like that
It&#39;s time for the right love God&#39;s Ô∏è.

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I‚Äôll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and ‚ÄúClover Cage - Learning To Love Myself‚Äù are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

I remember I used to ship the two girls when I was a kid 

2023???!!!

The music is good and the rhythm is also good and I have listened to some of the bases. That's why it is good. I have always liked this. It was the first video I heard and I love it a lot
The best part of this video is that it didn&#39;t make Letty look like a B

From a teen star to a well-made woman; Demi Lovato is an extraordinary singer, I've been a fan of this singer since I was young.

This Song sounds like a late 2000s hit. I cant bieleve it was made in 2015.

Ah gurl
I was struggling with writiing a training fight scene between my protagonist and a woman who doesn&#39;t really like her but is a good guy. This song helped me visualise the fighting squence and the video gave me an idea about how i want that fight to end. This may be 7 years old, but it&#39;s STILL helping people y&#39;all(also, imma play this at my wedding and walk really slow to make my relatives uncomf because according to them, bold girls are cHaraCTeRlEss smh)

Acts 2:38  God almighty with all your heart strength and soul  peace be with everyone

Outstanding Song
Thats the way all girls and women should feel confident and empowered always

YES THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN, WE ARE 
Like music   
Good song and video but the ending is good to but I think it would have been better if demi finally was able to beat up the other girl

I love it just love it I‚Äôm speechless

Demi Lovato is such a beautiful  and very talented lady

And by the way what&#39;s wrong with being confident

Oh my God I am inspiring you when I first heard 11 years you have inspired me to do the same thing in the video thank you

I love this song because it has Dominic's girlfriend from Fast and Furious
To get confident is a trade about hard working and understanding to his self if someone let you feel  Break down. You need to start to ask yourself did I deserve it what other people handle on me; no I‚Äò m strong I do that what you can‚Äòt goal. Fighting on continue forward.
