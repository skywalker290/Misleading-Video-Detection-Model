Bad match, what idiots you people are
That&#39;s why CR7 IS GOAT.

penaldo always flopping
Watched this video maybe 50 times lol

<a href="">1:00</a>

Hafeez Darraji’s comment is more beautiful than this foreigner 🙂❤
Damn what a bad game De Gea played, it's too bad they didn't call him up again
The GOAT was unstoppable💯🐐🇵🇹🙌

When he was about to shoot the freekick..for those few seconds ronaldo temporarily entered the zone (only anime fans would understand)

One man shouldered the burden of a whole nation, took them to almost all tournaments single handed and they betrayed him in Qatar when he needed the team to fight for him, the coach turned his back on him, team mates turned on him and the press… Ooh, Fifas tools always looking to down cast a man who came from nothing to be the BEST IN THE WORLD. They robbed him of the ballon d’or in the same year for fear of overtaking their favorite media son messi and instead gave it to Modric who didn’t even win the World Cup (at least they said it was a World Cup year). I already had my reservations about Fifa and their awards in 2010 when Messi won it and officially dismissed it in 2018. Thank you LEGEND RONALDO for everything, all the sweet memories and beautiful goals I will never forget especially the one against Juve in the UCL which had Even rival fans clapping. These deluded Messi fans can call u all d names they like tapnaldo, crynaldo, boxnaldo, penaldo and what other names, they know the truth you are one of the most skillful player to ever play the game, they know the truth you have more outside the penalty goals than their goat, they know the truth you have more solo goals than their goat, they know the truth you have more goals with ur weak left foot than their goat has with his right foot, you have more headers, you have more acrobatic goals, and you have more thunderbolts than their goat and yes it pains them to accept… you have more total GOALS than their goat both at club level and national level, at 38 man is still doing things nobody expected but at 36 their guy is the pink boys team and choking opponents anyhow these days 😂😂😂CRISTIANO RONALDO, the BEST THERE EVER WILL BE

Amazing CR7 ! The greatest of all time ! ❤❤❤..

Viernes 24/11/2023.      <a href="">19:13</a>
&quot;That&#39;s why he&#39;s THE GOAT. THE GOAT.&quot;😂

Someone watched this game and still decided to bench him against Morocco.... If he played full fame against 🇲🇦 and lost... Yes that&#39;s fair.. We&#39;ll all know he played and lost like it should be... Not subbing him in when you see that you&#39;re losing 1 to nil

22/11/2023😊
Who see 2023 they are legend 😅😅

If you can score 3 against Spain in a World Cup match, then you&#39;re the GOAT!!!

Foul on Pepe <a href="">0:30</a>

Ronaldo scored this useless hat trick in group stage and in the next round against Uruguay penalty naldo ghosted... probably he was pregnant

The match Pendu fans watch to satisfy their big ego, a little consolation after 2022/12/18!

and suddenly people forget how godly is cristiano

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/dv90XtfhAurw8gTgzar4DA"></a>
Where is Diego Costa?
but his fans will say this was a penalty but mock argentinas penalties, hypocrites

Everybody talks about Ronaldo’s performance no one talks about Diego costa ‘s performance

Gg free kick. Worst nightmare for goalies

Still getting goosebumps from this match

Real sports men will understand how much pressure there is in a free-kick at 88th min and that to your country is 1 goal behind and also if you lose this match you&#39;ll be out of worldcup. There is no football player who can do this not even Messi can do that. That&#39;s why who knows real hardwork and real football will always choose Cristiano Ronaldo over Messi.. always ❤️❤️🔥🔥

<a href="">1:24</a> 😳
What an influence 🐐

One of the greatest World Cup my opinion

Official. Grand. All.
Put away. You. Se. Everyone. Sem. Football. I. These. Teams
Don&#39;t know why Pavard&#39;s goal was ranked better than Nacho&#39;s.

When you realize ronaldo beated Morocco at 2018

That&#39;s why he&#39;s the goat THE GOAT ❤

Diego costa What a forward, what a striker!

Would you believe it?

Costa vs Ronaldo … And Ronaldo wins 🐐
Portugal vs spain? More likely ronaldo vs spain..

Perfect match 1 penalty, 1 normal goal, 1 free kick

2023

Yearly re-rewatch

&quot;Cristiano Ronaldo only scores goals against Cyprus and in unimportant matches.&quot;World Cup 2018. Hat-trick vs. Spain. The last one, this gem ☝🏽

This hat trick is worth the same as a World Cup

I don’t think people realise, playing against Spain is literally playing against Real Madrid and Barcelona combined.

This match is coming when everytime I think of 2018

best free kick of all time 🚀🚀
Cristiano was the strongest singles player in the world
bro no-one talking bout nachos beautiful goal bruh
Cristiano Ronaldo 👑
A penalty from a dive, a keeper mistake and a deflection against an average Spain team that lost to Russia and Morocco in the wc, this gotta be the single most overrated individual performance of all time🤣🤣🤣🤣

Suiii

Ronaldo goat 🐐
Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩💪💪💪
Coming back to this in 2023. After Mbappe’s heroics despite being in a losing effort, this is the second best individual performance in a match in World Cup history.

Former world cup winners couldn&#39;t win cause of one man...Ronaldo

This world cup didnt feel as a world cup compared to 2022 2014 and 2010

🐐

This match was literally Ronaldo Vs Spain 3              :          3

sssssUUUUUUUUUU

The greatest match ever ?

watchin&#39; in 2023

amazing!!!!!
It&#39;s sad  how everyone forgets about diago costa. I didn&#39;t even saw a single comment apriciating his performance. yes Ronaldo&#39;s performance was great but diago costa went underrated due to rono&#39;s performance. His first goal was way better. Take a bow costa 🫡

I still remember this game I was in a hotel in voi constituency ,Taita Taveta county 2018 ,Kenya watching the Game ...CR7 is absolutely genius 😍

Who is the commentetor of this match

That’s betrayal — Portugal is next to Spain/España and Ronaldo played for Real Madrid, and which is in Spain

Was this Ronaldo’s last free kick goal ever ?????

Now FIFA Doesn't Respect RONALDO
Props to Ronaldo but De Gea is such a bottler. It’s crazy how many blunders this guy makes for both club and country. How is this guy the first choice keeper for Spain.

Nah but nacho nacho really scored

Nacho&#39;s Goal Was Faster Than My Wifi.

As a Moroccan for me both Portugal and Spain are enemies that may become friends one day if they recognize their past fatal mistakes but France is a real enemy I wish Argentina win them even this last is not a friend either but also suffered from Spanish and British colonianism

Who&#39;s Watching in 2022

Watched Morocco vs Portugal match at Qatar World Cup 2022 which Portugal lose...After Knowing This could be last world cup of RonaldoI was very sad 😭😭😭that he would now never won a World Cup....

If Ronaldo becomes Monstrous ,then whatever be the situation... it&#39;s on his hands.such a match....But after the loss of moracco,it&#39;s really broken....WC is unlucky to grab Ronaldo&#39;s victory..Well Messi will finish it off hopefully...He will definitely share his victory and give credits to Ronaldo and Neymar well they deseved too..

Don’t write off Cr 7

‏It is the real phenomenon that Cristiánoa Ronaldo is a spherical miracle that existed on the pitch. And now she&#39;s gone 💔💔😴

had to watch this after they benched my boy

Yes football is a team sport but exemplary individuals like Ronaldo make such a difference. I watched the match and it isn’t just the goals but the passes and runs Ronaldo made which constantly threatened the opposing team and was clearly a cut above the rest.

Miss this ronaldo

We Will Miss 2018 Ronaldo 😞💔

why ronaldo why?????😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
whos here after Portugal&#39;s loss? had to remind me of this golden age . Absolutely shattered

In 2022 4 year later Qatar sucks so bad smelling trust on players league and world football ⚽🏈 just ends

Today maybe the last time we see the legend play for his country but will always support him ❤️ Rooting for this today ❤️ Viva Ronaldo Vamos Portugal❤️

Need this tomorrow

Watching this before the match against Morocco and after so much bad press hes been getting... truly carring an entire country on his shoulders.. CR7 Legend

The free-kick goal is very impressive. Having said this. In the first goal he dives to get the penalty, it&#39;s obvious. The second one is a mistake by the Gk.

Who&#39;s watching in 2022?

The contrast between this version Ronaldo and the current version Ronaldo  is HUGE

Seeing this as they bench Ronaldo round off 16

Nacho&#39;s goal was also on another level

HAT TRICK THO?

Personally, this is Cristiano&#39;s peak performance in a game.

I’m watching this in 2022 WorldCup night .. 1:26Am ..with Match of Argentina 🇦🇷 and  Netherlands 🇳🇱 in my another mobile .. Where Argentina has already scored 1 goal  ..

To all haters of Cristiano Ronaldo: Neither you or your sons or your grandsons will ever reach to the heights of Cristiano&#39;s right ball. Cristiano Ronaldo is the complete football player, a leader, a machine. He&#39;s the living definition of sacrifice and hard work.

It was more of a Ronaldo vs Diego
