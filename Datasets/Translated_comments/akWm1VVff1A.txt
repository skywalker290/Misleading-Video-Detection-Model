This kind of road system is not there in India. I hope Indian government apply this. I have been waiting when government will realize and give us international standard road and traffic system. I used to learn many symbols and systems for road, traffic, land, contours etc during my Geography subject in my high school, but none of those follows in India, except in some developed countries.

You should never abuse your language.

If BB went to Korea in this year, the video would have gotten a lot more views than this . Sab apne oppa ko dekhne ke liye idhr aa jaate 

One dick Johnny is taking deep 
The saddest part of this video is..... He doesn&#39;t have that two guys with whom he was talking to in this video. 

When bb goes to stage there a lady representative wants to handshake with bb but bb is so happy and can&#39;t see her properly by the way bhai ne izzat badha di b******d

When I saw Seoul on the thumbnail, I quickly clicked on the video (BTS)
