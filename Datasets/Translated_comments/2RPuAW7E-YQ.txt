Now guess what, life&#39;s sorted nd my &quot;sang hoon tere&quot; person is not in  my life anymore........ Still thankful to him for everything, stay blessed

I Get Goosebumpswhile listening this masterpiece

3 years already 

See, there is a commotion in the whole city, you are mine‚Ä¶Listen, what are you saying, these cold winds are in my ears‚Ä¶I have found what I want, whatever I asked from God, it says that there are many lakes‚Ä¶No one gets life better than fate. I have found you in my dreams, I have found you in my first meeting... Whatever you ask for from God is said in a few lakhs. Every person got more than fate before fate. There is a smile on everyone's face, with you, with you, with you, you are my shelter, with you, with you (x2) Look, it is not like that. Samjho, I meet you in the corner of the world, Samjho, where there is a flower, there is trouble in the job, Samjho, you are the same flower in the world. Look at me.. Think, what will happen if you and someone else come to me. Think, what will be the celebration and what will be the meeting. Think, the smiling stars who will sleep with you. There is a smile on you in the bed, there is a smile on you, there is a smile on you, there is a smile on you, there is a smile on you, you are my home, there is a smile on you, there is a smile on you, there is a smile on you (x2)

Was this song private for a whileBecause I saw all the videos of bb But how I Miss this one 

Comment me if you have watched episode 5 of Dhindhora 
This song get more than view&#39;s from tonny kakar

Bhuvan bhaiya you never let me rule.
Bhuvan's father's voice is appreciated 
I can feel there is no autotune 

Ugh....not feeling well , but like the song, I mean I felt kinda emotional listening to it and....umm just leave it

 Awesome 
Yaaar!!! Why am I obsessed with him soooo Much....I just want to Hug him soooooooooooooo Tightly! 

ok so basically did he died in the end and that is why the girl is crying? (just curious)

And I am aware of this after 3 years 

Whatever you do, I like it very much  I wanna meet you 
Damn almost forgot this one just love this one when i first heard this song i was 14 and tbh I didn&#39;t understand the meaning of this video till i was 15 -_- pretty stupid lol but when i realised it i cried so so so much......

yrrr ..  amazing song... 
I can&#39;t believe ki log avi v isse sunne aate hain...mera fav tha 2018 janurary mein

The best song and video I have ever seen. Really Yaar bhuvan sir is so talented what a emotional story any one would cry seeing this and what a voice he is a singer + comedian. Trust I thought he is just giving bad words in his video but when I started seeing his video there was a lot of fun and lesson to be learned. And all the songs and video&#39;s just fabulous.

We are lucky that YouTube has gifted us BB

Song is better than any rap artist..

Ohhhh yeahhhhhh

I have been listening to him till now
I like darshan raval voice and your voice

You made me cry, soo emotional
Beautiful song, so touching

Johnny Depp reminds me of seeing you

<a href="">3:00</a> If you don‚Äôt understand y he is playing Guitar at a Restaurant it‚Äôs because before he started YouTube he used to play Guitar as a professional at Pubs and Concerts

I really feel that we have got BB as a gift in disguise for our generation. I say so because there are so many YouTube content creator who came into this field by looking upon him and his work. Truly a blessed and unique person. May God bless you abundantly and there is no word to describe the beauty of this song.

I just got to know about his parents, Having been living without parents i know how it feels like.. My heart goes to him.. I feel like maybe i could do something for him,make him feel good or something as a gesture. This feels like a personal loss to me as well. May God give him more strength and more success.

Why is this song so underrated...One of the best Ô∏è

Main apne 1.5gb ka 1gb roz bhuvan sir k purane songs nd old video dakhke khatam kharta hu..want to meet this guy atleast 1time before my death

Loved the song.

For the first time, I had to think so much before typing a comment...everyone has talent, believe me, everyone has brains, only doing justice to same and keep believing in yourself will get you to taste the success or some ratio of success. I am so happy for BB insane lady and Carry too and so many great you tubers who work so hard so hard that so many people may not realize, that without nepotism which runs in all industries they made it big. I am also watching BB interview on film companion while listening to the song and lyrics carefully of this song, all you youtubers, even BBK who expressed his graph going slow, should never never never think negative and get worried about loosing your subs or likes to competitors, competition is good that gets the best out of you and improvise you. And you people have achieved a lot i mean insanely lot, so many peole love, aur kya chahiye yaar to die in peace

Sab theak tha srip tal se tal nihe mila

Watching this song in 2021 as well bhuvan i dnt knw why, but there is something u got in to yourself yaar i like many celebrities but never felt to meet them, but dnt knw y i wanna meet u once in my lifetime..........

Axxe logo ke saath hee aisa kyuu hota hnmay soul of his mother and papa rest in peace Ô∏è
