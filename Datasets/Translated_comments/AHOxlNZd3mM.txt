Poor car, May she rest in peace 😂😂

<a href="">

I have questions. Does they use real car? The red car

Bro the m moters is destroyes bruh

those movies are a big joke xDD

The power of camera tricks!Very action in big screens  from utilities to crews and big stars of fast and furious 9 its worth the efforts congratulations

Min <a href="">5:20</a> his brotherr

Dom cars don&#39;t fly
Fast and furious 7 is the only Hollywood movie I have watched in theatres, that too unexpected.

family

Cool

siblakve

paul is living ??

So these people actually destroyed a lycan hypersport??

tf??????? walker was diedddd

<a href="">0:44</a>

It&#39;s so silly that so many people in here think they used an actual Lykan HyperSport to just crash.. Even if you had the money and wanted to do it, most hypercars manufacturers wouldn&#39;t sell it to you for it to be destroyed. The same company that built the Lykan, W Motors, also built 10 copies with a fiberglass shell as opposed to carbon fiber, Porsche Boxster/Cayman engine and stretch chassis with no interior infotainment or any other features. All of the interior was CGI. Each car probably cost the studio at most $60,000 + 10 = $600,000.  YouTube comment sections remind me just how daft humans can be. It&#39;s incredible.

Familyyyy
nice

What a stupid movie, they are going to reach 20 with the same idiocy
cool

Rip Paul WALKER😢
Nice shoot computers

I don’t know why I didn’t realize Paul and vin had stunt guy’s. It’s actually kinda disappointing, and neither of the stunt guy look like them lol at all

Paul Walker, may you have khusnul khotimah, amen
Rip Paul Walker . Why they destroy this lykan ;-;

Miss you paul 😭
R.i.p al auto
Btw can someone tell me that which scene was pauls last scene in fast and furious 7?

<a href="">0:38</a> wait a minute... Paul Walker was alive when filming this scene? Was it his last appearance before dying?

I cant believe they really throw a car 😮

Paul Walker..no caption needed for this name

Rip poul waker
speed shooting how can camera man hold camera and record 😜😀😀😀

Making a movie is really hard🤦💯

😂

I think we should respect more stunt double man more than these actor&#39;s

Your right you dont never say no and now you got some of the most ridiculous action sequences. James bond gives great action sequences without looking untouch with reality

🚛🚛5🎮
Really James van nailed it as a director....hats off to him!!

Paul walker isn&#39;t dead he is waiting us to finish the line

Respect for Paul Walker 🚓
All credit goes to James wan 😘😘😘😘😘

How to total a lykan hypersport:

Really have that much money to waste all those super cars while im over here struggling to get a toyota

This is craaaazy....RIP Paul Walker

<a href=""> wow

how much have this cost

Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn&#39;t have an investment and I will tell you how soon he&#39;ll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be 💯 guaranteed.

The car is really nice but it's a shame😥
Great behind the scenes 👏

Imagine this car is “living being “

Hollywood looks real 🙏🙏🙏



Was the Hyper Sport Real?

<a href="">0:20</a> he has a roger federer cap...

This is why I love Fast and Furious!! They have great director

The cars flying from one building to another are really cool😍
Is that car is real

So they made the stunt guys actually jump out of the car only to then cut up the sequence so you can&#39;t actually tell it was real?? This is just like that time Tom Cruise did real skydiving only for them to add cgi clouds making it look fake.

Have a great day, God bless, Jesus Christ loves you all, John 3:16

Behind the scene totally amazing

Imagine how much money they lost destroying a lykan, they could just buy a toyota prius and mod it to look like a lykan

Poor car
Rip Paul

what a waste of a car

<b>Fantastic video 📉😎Looking at the bullish moves top crypto assets has been having since last year, I&#39;d call it a very big win for hodlers of btc.</b> <b>Though 2021 is set for much bigger gains as predicted by analysts,</b> personally holding is still a very odd way of making gains which isn&#39;t really my thing, considering the Dynamics and low bucks one gains within the time. I prefer trading assets which has provided me a far bigger pay gain than I initially imagined, although am still far from being an expert trader. Trading is serious business that is both technical and demanding, major reason I just employ the use of signals from trade expert Jayson Brian, I will admit his signals and trade guide has been top notch and core to my trading successes, trading experience and good mastery of the market really sets him apart from other pro trader.

Appeal from God.. 01/23/2021 Quatrain “Today it is difficult to collect 2 percent” Today people have doubts! Sometimes there is complete hopelessness! People’s behavior is slavish! You should not expect help from Heaven! Everything has developed into a vicious circle! The pandemic has revealed the cards! No one will help look around, You shouldn’t wait for changes until March! Everything will change in the World suddenly! There was no waiting for trouble! Russia has crossed the point of danger! All that’s left of the country is the name! Russia was sold out by its people! Criminal terror began! It was the prelude to the end of the country, The spiritual space was destroyed !The authorities were the first to rush to rob! The scale of theft is impressive! All that remains is to physically finish off Rus'! The people no longer understand anything! From moving upward they fell to the bottom! The speed of the fall is the highest! There is only one name from Greatness, Russia is already a bitter laugh! Faith in the People has been desecrated power! Power is particles of the CPSU-Party, Thieves' power is the Party's suit, People have been led to apathy! No - Ideas, which means no - Tomorrow! Behind the Union there was an Idea! Behind the Union there was a half-truth, Behind the New Russia - a thieves' idea! Robbing the Motherland is a shame! Criminals always have ideas! The authorities have secured surveillance over people, Control over people is the main occupation! The authorities have done everything against each other! The civil war has begun! There is an ideological blizzard in the country, Russia is a torn country! People don’t see countries of Tomorrow! The authorities cannot be physically defeated! People are afraid to tell the Truth! They no longer want to have anything! People are completely in fear! The authorities offer to “knock” on everyone! But this will result in the collapse of the country, Heaven will not save the country! No one will turn to God believes! People destroy themselves! I remind you that “God marks the rogue”! You need to find Me in yourself! Without God, a tragedy will happen to the country! Civilization will also perish! Death is already a tragicomedy, Believe me, you are at the last station! Russia today is pathetic spectacle! Lawlessness is through the roof! Russia is an ideological monster, People, while stealing, do not listen to God! Today it is difficult to collect 2 percent! Every person has an opinion! Subjective opinion is not worth a cent, There is no one Idea - destruction will come! People discuss, but there is no action !The authorities are no longer afraid of people! There is no correspondence between the authorities and the people, God knows best from Heaven! So Russia will not succeed! Rus' does not want a Prophet and God! The predictable ending will happen, Trouble is already at your doorstep! Amen. Father Absolute. 01/23/2021. ........
RIP the Lykan Hypersport

damn it they didnt jump from the towers....this movie sucks now

Waste of a great car

TA MORE THOSE EXPENSIVE Q THEY USED THAT WERE NOT DESTRUCTED AND TRUE NE ???

wow

...and it&#39;s dude-bro crap.

I dont think insurance wants to cover the set. How many super cars have they destroyed?

Good old days when CGI is only used to improve practical effects ! Now everything just piece of shit CGI ! Especially fucking marvel !

unnecessary
They said every detail In the movie, but they didn&#39;t even tell how Vin Diese manual shifted a supercar with paddle shifters.

Wow all those cars and yet they still made a shitty ass movie

There is a channel that has become the bank of information ( YOUTUBE: MIND WORKER ) There is a lot of effort in this channel. There is no such archive on YouTube, insistently. He deserves all this Labor Support. When you look at the channel you will understand what I mean....
Dafuck did they actually use real cars?

Dom, cars don&#39;t fly.CARS DON&#39;T FLYYY.!!!
first reaction: why am I watching this?second reaction: wooooo I&#39;m gonna watch it again!!

<a href="">

They filmed it in real life. But in the movie it looks like CGI with all those color grades and added VFX. So in the end they could have done it full CG. The result is not as impressive as the making of.

Fast and Furious 1 , Fast and Furious 2, Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift , Shit and Shitious 4-9 ...

I’m so happy, i never believe i will be this happy again in life, I was working as an air-hoster ( cabby crew ) for 3years but early this year, i loose my job because of this deadly disease called Herpes virus (HSV), I never felt sick or have any symptom, till all workers were ask to bring their doctors report, that was how i got tested and i found out that am HSV positive that make me loose my job, because it was consider as an STD and is incurable disease, i was so depress was thinking of committing suicide, till i explain to a friend of mine, who always said to me a problem share is a problem solved, that was how she directed me to Dr Scott, that was how i contacted him and get the medication from this doctor and i got cured for real, I just went back to my work and they also carry out the test to be real sure and i was negative. Please contact this doctor if you are herpes positive,hiv/aids,cancer,coronavirus or any STD diseases his email is: Dr.Scottwitcher21@<a href="">gmail.com</a>. You can also text ::: +1 339-201-9132

So method director graphy in Hollywood . Really ✊

Iv always hated this scene, no offence to every one working on this film but I always saw Fast and furious as a street racing films not it’s all actions and heists basically GTA the film

6th 6

A couple of seconds I film taking all this perfection! Master piece. We miss you Paul!

Can we just stand still by the fact they destroyed a 4 million dollar car for a movie scene

Yo that was a real Hypersport wich at least costs 3 Million$ !

Why they got to kill a nice ass car

Paul walker character one of the best❤️<a href="">#RIP</a>😥

Why is love according to the method of the &quot;baal hasulam&quot; The wisdom of Kabbalah,  is the solution to all troubles for humanity?Because all nature is a force, a feature, a system, a formula of love. Of connection and unity between opposites, between hot and cold, hard to soft, white and black, male and female, sweet and bitter, light and dark.In every atom and particle, in every inanimate plant and life, the whole universe and beyond, the whole reality is the result of a connection between opposites.For humanity and the individual, one power rules from the day of birth, hatred of others and self-love at its expense, egoism.By combining the power of love with the equation, man maintains the connection between the opposites and thus stops resisting nature, and enters into harmony with it, which is the goal of nature, to do good to creatures.Until then, man will suffer great and immense suffering in order to recognize and submit to the demand of nature,He must strive in his power and choice in loving others.Thus he will acquire intellect and wisdom to connect the two opposites and will complete the nature that was created with unintentional intent, but rather man must complete it, and manage it, and bring it to perfection.And why did nature do that?(Nature and God are the same gematria 86)In order for man to grow and develop in his free choice and thus conduct creation as the conductor of an orchestra, And if man had been created in advance corrected and perfected?So he was like a perfect animal, dog and cat. But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them. After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.If so the solutionIs not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth(Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender. He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed.To do good to creatures.Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!!And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.This is called light to the Gentiles. And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.&quot;For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!&quot;Love friends only love. It is the solution for every individual and for everyone together.how? To do propaganda of connection and not of separation and hatred ...

so they break 3 lykans , really?????

Why did they use blue colour screens
