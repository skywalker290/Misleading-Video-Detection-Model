This didn&#39;t age well

<a href="">5:15</a> - pewds on grind

This gonna be sad when he quits

yagga

For the past 4 years of watching Pewds, hes becoming more mature in life and Im so happy for it ü§ó‚úåÔ∏è

Crazy times ü§£ü§£

POV: You were looking through YouTube search to see if anybody made a video on him, for leaving YouTube right before 2022.

Test

Pewdiepie: eats foodMedia: &quot;He is protesting against world hunger&quot;

MR BEEEAST ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ninja?‚Ä¶ ok

this so sad after watching his videos every week and realising that he has quit youtube

Poppy: SimplyNailogical is kids channel.Me: Beeeeeeeen! Explain plz.

You shouldn&#39;t ever have to announce that you are taking a break, you should just vanish. You do you. I may have roasted you by calling you trash, but it was sarcastic gaming trolling attitude. At least you responded properly by wearing a trash bag.

PewDiePie: tiktok is stupidMedia: PewDiePie says he is gonna destroy tiktokAnd makes racist jokes on tiktok&#39;s ceo

üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

Nice introüòÇ

It‚Äôs not unusual for theory‚Äôs to go around

Very good video ever YouTube

Pewdiepie 110million +395000

Over all these years, felix has seen so much of media bullshit. I feel bad for him that  people don&#39;t actually understand how great of a guy he is.

Pew news back pls

I‚Äôm big fan but omg  üò± this is sooo sad üòûüôÅüòìüò≠

That Beanie is so cute.

I love how swedish he is with accepting awards, he is so humble which you can tell because he is swedish. The most terrifying thing you can do to a swedish person is treat them differently than everyone else by praising their work. You can see how it makes them uncomfortable. I love it

Apoostrophü§£

He legitimately said apistrofy

WHERE ARE YOU NOW QUESTION MARK?WHY DID YOU LEAVE NOW?

Mr Beast f-ing planted 20 mil trees and broke 13 world records,, Pewds literally had made 20 millions subs in 4 months, and the Creator of the Year goes to someone who promotes drugs.

Wow its so sad that pewdiepie quit

I like your beanie.

Legend entrance too üëçüòÇ

Noo

I don&#39;t like tana very much

This why I don&#39;t believe anything the news says about Trump.

:(

<a href="">6:25</a> I thought the second one said beat Edgar

Is it weird I&#39;m watching this almost a year later when this is all irrelevant?

Don‚Äôt you hate fake comments. Like, my mom quit her job and we are now living on the streets because of fake comments. We are eating dead rats because of fake comments

Piggy pies is the square

Hey, Wait.  I just realized something.  Pewdie likes to talk about himself!

I really like how people make jokes about Markiplier being a child who laughs at his own poop jokes when Felix made a full on game about it üòÇ

Pewdiepie:drinks waterMedia:he is mocking the thirsty

After watching the clip at <a href="">12:48</a> I think he should be in Passion gang.

lmao, going back to all the times media shit on him makes me laugh...

If it‚Äôs all wrong it becomes fact

Media: Pewdiepie, the guy that makes horror game reviews is quitting.

News Media Titles: Poppy Smoria mispronounced &#39;apostrophe&#39; App-o-strof THIS MEANS SHE&#39;S QUITTING YOUTUBE?!?!?!??

<a href="">8:37</a> OMG Lilly Singh, the brown bisexual women who&#39;s not at all an old white guy!?!?

People need to realize pewdiepie is given his money basically by the people so if someone has a problem, just no.

simplynailogical~pewds: epic, a kids channel..LOL

<a href="">3:55</a> Aper-stroph

MrBeast really deserved that award, but knowing him I don‚Äôt think he cares. He too knows it‚Äôs bullshit

Everyone&#39;s talking about Poppy Smoria and Mary Ham but what about Erin Burnett

&quot;The project is myself, i can&#39;t sell myself.&quot;<b>Are you sure about that?</b>

Alright guys let&#39;s be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.

Tana Mongoose pay to win creator of the year

Plot twist: Pewdiepie quit youtube but poppy smoria took over his channel and didn&#39;t change the channel name because she didn&#39;t want people to know that she&#39;s operating the pewdiepie channel.Edit: i confused poppy gloria and poppy smoria together i am sorry for i have sinned.

This is incredible &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; actually sayed that he was over worked and that he was going to take break!!! This just Proves my point even More how USA is a piece of crap country

Pewdiepie- &quot;So I had this low quality version of this.&quot;Ad- &quot;Damnit! How could this happen?&quot;Skips rest of ad.Pewdiepie- &quot;Cause they changed the title.&quot;

pewdiepie nooooooooo =[

no... nOT THE LIINKED IN

I would be so happy if you were quitting <i>YOUTUBE</i>

<a href="">10:32</a> why is this so wholesome

For three months, till today I thought pewds quit... Trump was right fake news everywhere

Marzia put a black magic spell on you. That&#39;s why you are still connected to me because we were made for each other. You came to me and said we were married. Ok I&#39;m going to say it  Jack Septic eye slept with her. The water Bottle Flip  one. In the beginning you went to the bathroom and he bragged about it. Then you shot him and went to jail. You went back in time and edited it. That is why Jack is still alive.  I was watching NASA&#39;s trip to the moon. That might help you.

This is a quick interpretation of how the ‚Äú news‚Äù are willing to go so damn low, jeez

&#39;pewdiepie farts&#39;media: he&#39;s maKIngg fuUn oOf PEoPLe wiTH dIorREA

He obviously just wanted the money

Pewdiepie: <b>still alive</b>News: He&#39;s making fun of dead people

Pew News : The Real News

RIP

P

I want him to say &quot;apostrophe&quot; 10 times in a row.

I am VERY IMPRESSED That PewDiePie Actually Has 103M Subscribers and is the Most Popular YouTuber Ever. If You Think About It, Theres 7B People In The World and 100M is Like a 10th of 1B. Hopefully That Makes Sense.

2020 is officially the worst year ever

This did not age well...

I think they were true

Pewdiepie: <b>gets flu</b>Media: pewdiepie has corona virus ü¶†

You suck now you gave up your crown

And now üò¢üò¢ it&#39;s true.

So racist! u want everyone to earn their profits from dlive, and try to make this world connected with tron and bittorrent! Best thing u could ever have done! last time i use youtube!

F

Fun fact, yellow journalism (fake news) was invented by Benjamin Franklin, to win more support for the revolutionary war of the united states of america against the British. Yes, dude did invent some crazy schmech in his life, including that.

How long will his break be?

Pewdipie reaction be like: <b>Whats happening to thiz people</b>

Cannabis is legal in CA. As is prescription Adderall. But you are right. I don‚Äôt know why young people think drugs are ‚Äòcool‚Äô. If you‚Äôre gonna use legal things, just do it without the need to brag. Coz so many people do it. It‚Äôs nothing. It‚Äôs boring.

Whos watching when he acutually quits youtube

Pewdiepie: Im taking a breakPoppy Smoria: Pewdiepie is taking a breakMedia: Racist, Antisemite Pewdiepie quits Yuotube.

I just liked how straightforward and honest he was about that Tanna thing. He straight up said he hated her without caring about what others might think or what she might&#39;ve said. I üíØ% liked and appreciated that tbh.

The news and media rarely attacks these celebrity drug promoters but always attacks the gamers who are not even a sliver close to as bad.

This is very good news.

To create the world you want to live in, you need to stick up for the people you believe in. I really dislike when the media tries to tear Pewdiepie down. I&#39;m not a super fan and don&#39;t watch every video he puts out, but I will stick up for him if others try to bring him down.

Just don‚Äôt leave

Pliz come back

Pewdiepie: this is bullshit

Nah he ain‚Äôt, he just taking a break

The truth that pewdiepie is quitting YouTube because of terms of service

Pewdiepie: <b>dies</b>Media: He&#39;s making fun of alive people

I quit being alive

I was on my google page just searching up dog videos i go back twice and i see a picture of Felix and it says &quot;pewdiepie the king of YouTube has joked about running out of ideas and quiting youtube, its good to see hes taking that joke seriously&quot; i flipped out! And that lead me to watching this video, im so glad that hes not

Plz dont quit

Ever

Good now dont come back

Felix, we understand. If you need to take a break we get it. You need time for yourself. Everyone needs a bit of me time. If you need to then you can take a break. Take as long as you want we understand take time off spend time with Marzia we will be alright. So take a month off we will be fine. We understand

Honestly did we really expect anything else from the media

It is just a break right ?

You will post again right ? Please don&#39;t stop posting i just started watching you and i love it.

News must be embarrassed

Pewdiepie: gets on plane to go on holiday News media: Felix is planing 9/11 two

Man, this Poppy Smoria person really reminds me of PewDiePie. :&#39;(

Pewdie I‚Äôm out

Sorry you have to burden this crap pewds. Never mind. 100 million people have your back. Not to mention Marzia ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Clearly pewds has never seen simplys channel lmao

Pewdiepie: SleepMedia: Pewdiepie is dead in 2020

So this were it ends

The streamy awards hold absolutely no value. Especially after Tana winning ANY award, much less greater of the year

It was one of the main headline on the news channel for me XD

are we just going to ignore the was he said apostrophe

Pewdiepie:‚ÄúI am really sad.‚ÄùAlso pewdiepie:*laughs*

Everytime he speaks in swedish accent he making fun of Greta Thunberg

I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re the most subscribed person on youtube. I can&#39;t imagine if another &quot;creator&quot; had 100mln subscribers, I understand it&#39;s really difficult for you but really I thank you for being so modest and an example for everybody. Stay strong Felix

I hate how the media cant take a joke, neither can half of the internet

Good on you! Screw everyone else take time for you. We love you Pewds! End of the last video was better too. Can&#39;t believe the hype

People that don‚Äôt watch your videos and still see those news places will believe it all

With Awards It&#39;s like in IT industry ... you want your startup to be funded... move your startup to States. Simple, boohaaa!

Love comments! So true!!!

Had such a good laugh!!! A joke... all that media crap :D but still fun if you have head on your shoulders :)

How did you just say apostrophe?üòÇ

When you realise beating the enderdragon is on the same level as getting 100 mil subs and getting married

that beanie tho

Why would pewds take a break from linkedinüò≠üò≠ this is so sad

whats the fan password, i forgot.

brofist dont let go!!!!!

This comment section is so supportive

<a href="">10:49</a> WTF does that even mean?

During the break they&#39;re going to say he died or he had a child

<b>And that is why Pew New is the most reliable News Source on the planet!</b>

pewdiepie feed your parrots a cookie they will breed &gt;.&lt;

why do they all use the same 3 pictures of pewdiepie for their articles

Pewdiepie we love you dont quit

I have a question. Where did all the Minecraft videos go??

Literal proof that cnn is fake news.

Putting out a video every day for years without stop definitely warrants a break. He has earned it.

Guys, I‚Äôm heartbrokenWhy is he quitting üòî

Aw, man. You have a loyal enough fandom that you can take 6 months off, come back and your fans will die of happiness. Take a break, rest, travel, enjoy Marzia and the rest of the family, discover new things you like doing, go out there!!!! Enjoy YOUR life. YOURS! Real fans don&#39;t read or care about bullshit media crap. Real fans want your happiness! You gave us 1736363662 videos that made us happy and distracted us from our miserable lives. You don&#39;t even have to explain anything! We&#39;re not your boss, this is not an office. Youtuber aren&#39;t granted sick days, bad days, vacation days. So you&#39;re the one that need to realize when your mind and body needs rest. So go, have fun, have another honeymoon ‚ù§ Marzia knew when she needed to take care of herself and was like &quot;i&#39;m out&quot;, that was incredibly brave. Take it from her and leave for as long as you feel you need. You have money, that&#39;s not a problem, so you can focus on actually using it for things you wanna do, maybe even new projects you were postponing, or just simply rest your mind. Also take it from someone who spent 5 years 100% focused on work and used the money i made to go back and forth from work and eat after work cause I was too tired to cook. Like it or not, this is a job now. But so much different. In an office you don&#39;t need to read hate comments every day, gossips about you, have to smile when you don&#39;t feel like it. Entertaining is so stressful, it takes so much energy to enjoy thing when you have eyes on you all the time. Not that is a bad job at all! I&#39;m sure you love it and your fans! But everyone needs a rest every once in a while. You go, those who really care about you will wait ^‚Ä¢^

Pewdiepie if you are going to quit YouTube  don&#39;t  tell jimmy

It&#39;s not unheard of for celebrities to get targeted by tabloids for any mundane thing they do - like Pewds, who&#39;s basically just taking some time off of his full-time job.What&#39;s really sad is how many news outlets have essentially turned into tabloids.  They don&#39;t actually tell the news anymore; they fabricate stories for profit instead.

<a href="">12:50</a> but pewds, she‚Äôs all quirky and different. Don‚Äôt you get that it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs quirky and different, guys it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs so quirky. Can you see how quirky she is

Wait they have awards for this sort of thing now? It really has gone corporate. No wonder the soul has been sucked out

Im in belgium and they say it on tv

Pewds: Says he is having a kid.The media: He&#39;s planning on murdering his grandma

I am sorry great emperor but I have just found out that you are no longer the great emperor of YouTube T-series has over thrown you                Pewdiepie                   üëë                T-series

Hey, if ur reading this comment, then you probably can read, good stuff.

At least you didn&#39;t &quot;die&quot; like Jackcepticeye

does everyone else also say &#39;apostrof&#39; when saying apostrophe?. Imma start using that.

When I first heard the news a few things came to mind one was that you were tired you had been uploading for years dealing with attacks from everyone and had broken record after record and figured you may just want some time to relax and spend time with marzia and settle into the married life so spend some time away from YouTube and do what you need to do for you

I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t stand David Dobrik. Mr. Beast is cool for everything he&#39;s done. I love Safiya, and Simply. I&#39;m ok with Tana. Award Shows are just famous people giving themselves awards. üòÇ

Pewdiepie: doesn‚Äôt have AirPodsMedia: making fun of people in wheelchairs

fresh 9yolds actually can learn a lot from pewnews, they know pewds content, they know pewds, also they can see the controversies in the media. In my opinion one of the best examples that TV, newpapers, or whatever aren&#39;t always right nor rightful. They can see it with their own eyes and proof it wrong. That&#39;s a lesson many of us old folks learned much later, or haven&#39;t even learned yet.

YouTube should advertise the voting but in a way like ‚Äú bot for ur fav creator without any biased based on ur subscriptions‚Äù

where did he get that cute ass beanie though is the real question

Pewds this was even on belgian news

You should think about yourself - it&#39;s your life :). If it&#39;s time to change you go and do it. Love to you! xxx

HOW COULD HE BREAK?!

But...nothing CNN said was untrue? Of course he can go after low budget internet tabloids and the &quot;news media&quot;

Why is everyone freaking out too, if he wants to take a break let him. He makes a video every single day and then has to deal with shit like this.

Its just like taking leave guys come on please be smart

Alright guys let‚Äôs be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.

The legend won&#39;t quit that easily. He risk his career and then quit? That is not so real. Another BIG FAT FAKE media news

Very nice idol powerrrrr powerrrrr

How often will you use the same face on the thumbnailPewds: Yes

Did you... Did you call Simplynailogical a kids channel??

Are you moving to mixer too? M$ sellouts.

So nobody&#39;s ganna talk about the fact that he calledSimply nailogical a kids channel lmao

Even my dad heard about it now that‚Äôs sad

This video was actually very nice and instructive. Good job Felix, you can go on YouTube professional.

Hello humans who read this.I am asking for a big favour, as I am trying to get in contact with Pewdiepie (Felix) because I have a business id√©a I think he would be interested in.I am Swedish aswell as Felix and want to discuss a business id√©a with him, but it is very hard to get in contact with him or his &quot;manager&quot; or whatever I need to in order to have a chance of him reading what I have to say.Christmas is here in 2 hours and all I really wish is to forward a Email to him explaining my id√©aThis is as random as it gets but I am desperately trying to get in contact with him so I am now trying every way possible.Just 5 minutes with him or his manager would mean the world to me, I know many people probably try to do this but my id√©a is very big and can affect the internet in a good way since a new youtube era is here.I really dont know what else to write other than this is my biggest dream and it would be an honor to atleast get an Email that he could read.Best regards, Alex from South of Sweden.

How dare you be against open borders and children&#39;s genitals being mutilated (for everywhere except Israel). You anti-semite!!! Next you&#39;ll go full National Socialist and be against child rape.

Dang Rest In Peace I will miss you :.(

But the king has cancelled  for quitting news today

i would like to point out that simply nailogical is anything but a kids channel lmaoo

the karens don&#39;t catch the drip

It&#39;s fun and frustrating to see how Media changes your perception of reality

I worked myself into a burn-out. Dident give myself enough off time and took my work home with me....Take a break if you want dude. Its good for you. Keeps you sane.

This is like the SSundee took a break but worse, cause Pewdiepie didn&#39;t actually take a break yet.Just saying, I didn&#39;t recognise any of those nominee&#39;s for creator of the year. Other than Chamberlin which I feel I&#39;ve heard somewhere before, I don&#39;t know these people. (other than mr. beast and ninja)

I think most people understand why Felix would want to take time out with his  lovely wife Marzia. Wishing you both a very Merry Christmas, adventures and happiness in 2020. XXX

Pewdiepie: talks about how media is displaying false information Pewdiepie‚Äôs fans: makes fun of the media with this meme format

Why are they like that though? Why don&#39;t you report something that is more important then &quot;Pewdipie quiting&quot;. For example, the Hong Kong protests.

I love this, I never said this, but Pewdiepie made this video on DEC 17th, my birthday, this year I am 19 years of age, Pewdiepie called his subs 19 year olds and not 9 year olds....I&#39;ve never felt to important when I&#39;m not.

Im dutch and here in the Netherlands it was all over the news!

Pewds pls don t go..

Simply Nailogical is not a kids&#39; channel though üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Look we all take breaks. Our breaks are called vacation. So to all the boomers out there who are offended because they don‚Äôt take breaks you have fricking vacation. In comparison to Piewdiepie who doesn‚Äôt take a lot of breaks... We are really lucky to have you Pewds ‚ù§Ô∏è

The amount of attention they give you must be flattering. You‚Äôre like a well known lightening rod they can use for propaganda.Instead o being annoyed that someone is so successful, why not be inspired and try to learn how they do what they do. That‚Äôs seems more fruitful. They‚Äôre not like magic and contain something that can‚Äôt be replicated. I mean various things might have made it easier for them, which you could say about anything, but it might also be easier for you so who knows, either way you‚Äôd at least get better by studying them.

Pewdiepie:says n word Media: talked about it for 2 days Pewdiepie: I‚Äôm tired Media:  blows this up on everything pewdiepie says he‚Äôs quoting YouTube then lies to subscribers :0

Reason why elon criticized news media

It&#39;s because it&#39;s a baby!!!

Pewdiepie you will get arrested by FBI your saying Sweden will invade with weapons how are these jokes you seem like a psychotic lunatic don&#39;t be surprised standing in the U.S supreme court for multiple allegations you might end up in jail and become someone&#39;s wife

fans: PLEASE DON&#39;T QUIT PEWDIEPIE!!!!!Coppa: ima ruin this man&#39;s whole fans and subscribers &gt;:))))))))))))

watch from <a href="">10:18</a>, Gus Johnson does not give a single <b>**</b>

See you soon Pewdie-Kun! &gt;w&lt;

I died when he said Simply nailogical is a kids channel out of all the videos to chose from lol

No screw Tana, she is a useless human being.

It&#39;s better than all

Pewdiepie uploads a video 25 hours after the other 24th hour pewdiepie dies

Pewdiepie:I am not quitting Youtube Media: He is lying and abandoning his fans.Pewdiepie:*sighs*Why does it happen to me?

six million people have seen this now.

Don&#39;t quit pewds.  p.s.  Your eyes are dreammy blue green in this video. xoxo

PewDiePie: I am taking a breakMedia: he chooses spiritual path

&quot;That&#39;s who is the creator of the year?&quot; That hit deeper than it should&#39;ve been. Like wow. Yes, that&#39;s exactly who&#39;s creator of the year. The gap is unbelievable

APPASTRAWPH

NEWSFLASH: Pewdiepie Quits Snapchat

in every countries , there are trash reporters in media. In Korea we call them &quot;ki re gi&quot; = &quot;Í∏∞Î†àÍ∏∞&quot;

breaks are good for mental health

<a href="">4:20</a> there‚Äôs your answer for why they‚Äôre  blowing it out of proportion. It‚Äôs for the brain dead people who actually read their garbage unironically

I thought it was believable, but I‚Äôm not at all surprised it was fake as shit.

I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôd gone practically nonstop this whole time.  I really hope you don‚Äôt stress out from NOT constantly working and checking everything.  I hope your vacation goes great though.  You really do deserve to blow us off for a while and think about yourself, Marzia, and your critters üíï

What if he‚Äôs not even taking a break

pewdiepie quits YouTubewhen?

Stupid media, should have been Mr. Awesome Beast!

if he stops making videos,maybe he&#39;ll lose all his subscribers

YOU DESERVE THIS BREAK

Apostrophe

Lol if it was fan voted, can we just take a moment to realize that Mr.Beast chose to save the earth than tell his fans to vote him creator of the year. We all know he would have won if he told his fans to vote for him.

u not a vlogger?

Poppy Smoria: Acts as if he‚Äôs PewDiePie himselfMedia: PeWdiEpiE‚Äôs tWiN bRotHeR reVeAlEd?

We were on a break üòÇüòÇüòÇ

When he takes a break he should just pre record like a 20 hr play through of some game and upload like 45 min once a week for his die hard fans, right?

<b>Ninja? Ok...</b> üòÇ

I can understand that you need a break and be heartbroken at the same time thank you very much

What would we do without News Media?

In reality, he‚Äôs on hiatus

peuu neuus

Omg I am so sad

Appastrof

People forget pewds took a break last year in August, it wasn&#39;t too long but it was significant cause he prepared no videos. He&#39;s allowed to have breaks

Pewdiepie: takes a breakMedia: <b>PEWDIEPIE OFFICIALLY QUITS YOUTUBE THIS IS SO SAD</b>Seriously wtf is wrong is with this world.

Mr. Beast deserves all the awards.

<a href="">5:30</a> Pewds watches his own videos? ü§î

We should make our own awards! To finally give credit to actual good youtubers!!

PewDiePie gets himself a black sweatshirtMedia: PewDiePie hates his own race!

Pewds shouldn‚Äôt have to explain why he wants to take a breaküò§üò§üò§

You and Marzia deserve a break ‚ù§Ô∏è

Noooooooo Felix

and I thought pewdiepie had more than t series

The most subtle flex with the fold phone

jesus christ poor gus had to sit at that award thing yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

Casey should stop putting himself in shitty situations

That‚Äôs because The Media doesn‚Äôt do their JOB by doing Research  üò© it‚Äôs their JOB

They don&#39;t do the work anymore they just guess now

&quot;I cant let someone step in&quot;say that to raywilliamjohnson

Everyone: ApostrophePewDiePie: ApPaStRoFf

Not even fitz talk much about drugs....

Glad he brought back his channel

Pew die pie said he was going to delete his channel at 100 mill hasn‚Äôt done it

The nword

I love the way he says ‚Äúapostrophe‚Äù

Got married Beat ender dragon100,000,000Hmm... I spy with my little eye...

I got panic disorder because I didn&#39;t take any breaks myself, breaks are healthy, go take a break, everyone, just die for a little while and reincarnate when you feel great again.

Pewdiepie: shakes a mans hand.The Media: <b>Pewdiepies gay?!?</b>

Tana &quot;Mojo&quot;

Why don&#39;t you just let Edgar take over the channel?

Pewds: <a href="">5:08</a>Me: OMG THATS SO SAD üòéüòé

I can&#39;t believe pewds said that simply nailogical is a kids channel I&#39;m dying

Everyone just keep racking up view time on pewds account so he can pay rent haha

pewdiepie doesn&#39;t get enough views for his amount of subs

‚ÄúApastroff‚Äù

pewdiepie  is  hype....üòÇ

He deserves a break they need to chill

Appestroff

Tonight i had a dream, pewdiepie was my dad. That was a good dream because i dont have a dad.

I got suspended ones for saying CNN is fake news, I was correct.

lol they acting like we sad but we‚Äôve been asking you to take a break for years...

What do pewdiepie &amp; trump have n common?

I like tana mongol

I know he was not quitting just a break a small hiatus , he never mentioned quit! It&#39;s so annoying like boi! But I&#39;ll wait for him to come back! I support you in whatever you are going to do for the better for yourself! PEACE!

Thank you for being a person with a consistent character and morals &lt;3

11m: she&#39;s so humble: that&#39;s why her clothes have her initials written all over them

I am from Taiwan, and I feel annoyed that the mainstream media here use Pewdiepie&#39;s name to write articles just to gain more views.I don&#39;t watch Pewds&#39; youtube every day (I really love to, tho lol), but the moment I saw those articles pop up I immediately knew it can&#39;t be true that pews is quiting youtube. Very funny that the articles about pews quiting youtube almost have the same content: a.) pewdiepie is king of youtube and b.) shocking news that he will leave youth because c.) he said &quot;I want to take a break&quot;

We&#39;re talking about Media Pewdiepie, What did you wait for?

A-pos-troph?

My local radio station talked about it

PewDiePie: <b>Is tired</b>Media: &quot;GUYS HE&#39;S TIRED HE&#39;S GONNA QUIT&quot;PewDiePie: <b>actually generating secondary content through subtly indicating highly misleading statement leads that entices poorly immersed journalists from mainstream media outlets to his advantage</b>Media: <b>*surprised Pikachu face*</b>

Pewdiepie: a gamer/youtuber creatorThe media: this is a certified vlogger classic

So dose this mean if pewds takes a break from youtube t-series is gonna take the throne ???

It&#39;s true or not

‚Äúpewdiepie calls out tana, recently awarded ‚Äòcreator of the year,‚Äô for promoting drugs to her underage audience‚Äù would‚Äôve been a much better article tbhstill annoying, but if they wanted him in a title...

You go Pewd‚Äôs, take a break, relax for a while, enjoy some time without worry, we will miss the content for a bit, but everyone needs a break.

Here in the Netherlands every youtuber in the news is called a vlogger

Pewdiepie says he&#39;s taking a break, doesn&#39;t realize YouTube doesn&#39;t allow vacations.

Pewdiepie is quitting YouTube? About time.

Pewdiepie was like a father to me

He really called simply a kids channelüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Quit youtube is not something that you do. Its not a day to day job. You just stop.

Someone should tell PewDiePie about this.

Just take a vacation a few dedicated weeks of the year it really helps

Pewdiepie: Has no cool awardsAlso Pewdiepie: Awards are dumb guys

Media: YouTube royalty Pewdiepie has been outmatched by an eight-year-old boy after his dramatic announcement that he&#39;d be taking a break from the video site.

Liberal media is a jokeI wouldn&#39;t be surprised because of all the slander and reticuling he gets from it that he probably leans more to the right, not like that&#39;s a bad thing of course

OMG THIS IS SO SAD

19 yr olds let pewds take a break and let&#39;s wait until he comes back

Please don&#39;t quit Youtube, the media was lying don&#39;t listen to them. I still need you Pewdiepie and the whole Bro Army also still needs you too. So don&#39;t leave us Pewds. We still love you bro. Be strong. And brofist too.
