I like sara as agood girl
Sara was amezing  girl  khud pe hasna  badi baat hai

Saif is don lol

Why do I like only Dom's girl?
What a fun interview

The actual role model 

I love sara because she is beautiful, from cultured family, Frank and maintain her weight nicely also she respect all the Hindu rituals , religious but I hate her because she has obsession about Aryan (KT),pahariya ........... I think Sahid is more handsome than kartik...

I alsi like Sara. I hate the booby sisters.

Good

Posture perfect 
Poo as your stepmother. ...

Watching her twice for her answers

Clear with this ....let stack it down...other hot scenes up....clear it from there Google India...Pakistan operation closed...

Bollywood Shahenshah Dilip Kumar and badshah Shahrukh Khan are the permanent bollywood kings for all time (from 1913 to 2022 and to the end of bollywood), because highest (8) filmfare awards for best actor champions/most (8) filmfare awards for best actor winners are Shanenshah Dilip Kumar and badshah Shahrukh Khan. Shahenshah Dilip Kumar: 1954 daag, 1956 azad, 1957 devdas, 1958 naya daur, 1961 kohinoor, 1965 leader, 1968 ram aur shyam and 1983 shakti. Badshah Shahrukh Khan: 1994 bazigar, 1996 dilwale dulhania le jayenge, 1998 dil to paagal hay, 1999 kuch kuch hoota hai, 2003 devdas, 2005 swades, 2008 check de india and 2011 my name is Khan.

I like Sara Ali Khan for the person she is. She is fiercely independent, confident and so articulate with her thoughts. May she find lots of happiness and success in whatever she does.

When dream s incomplete,  that laughter s incomplete

Why fatwa is not issued against her. These Muslims will play whatever they want and blame Hindus.

Sara where is your hijab? Why your community is not trolling you for not wearing hijab? Why you are not supporting your community on hijab.

this is new generation, care free but not typical tom boy 

Bubbly sara

Crush

Celebrity log itna gyan pelte h bhai sidha bolo n dono me bnti ni thi to ek sath ni rehte the

Positive vibes

Where&#39;s the full interview?

I luv u lot sara
She looks so innocent 

I really love her vibe.The place seems vibrant when she&#39;s there.Rarely seen this kind of people.

Very beautiful karte waqat maste nahe karge khamushe say maza khatam hota he sexce awaze karyge tu sahe he

Sara is very. Intelligent
She is so real n down to earth

She&#39;s so charming

my fav sweet heart sara mam
Happiness family to mamji

Don't know Hindi? Be it in India or England.
She is So Adorable and Beautiful

This shows saif Ali Khan treated her equally like he treats taimur..else divorced father usually doesn&#39;t even bother to ask how their kids are... not everyone is fortunate like her... many girls had a father who used to beat their moms so there is nothing much to flaunt here ...

By far the only set of interviews where every actor has unfiltered behaviour 

What did she say from <a href="">2:50</a> to <a href="">3:00</a> ?

Dude, i seriously can&#39;t believe i loved her so much as a fan but now she only makes me remember how badly sushant was treated!! You&#39;ve got everything money, family background in bollywood, drugs to get fit, still took life of such humble personRIP sushant..️

I personally think she should do more n more interviews so we could just watch her

She is soo adorable 

Sara ️ i  sara
All lie,, no daughter will be happy if some other woman came to her dad&#39;s life while her mom is still alive... Why is she soo liar I don&#39;t like her from very first time... Over acting

I just love sara... So gud and simplicity..

Anything expensive is bhada omg she is real

She is so amazing person with good heart

Look DP, there is a problem in showing baby face.
You are ossum Sara

So downtoearth
One thing, they don&#39;t follow is being nude.. They are very into English except nude, 

Her fake laugh on Nawab gareeb ho gy 

I love this host. He is so on point. He gets what he wants from you. 

Don’t ever change I know you are gonna not because you have got your nature as a  and I love it bold and bindasoh yeah<a href="">#befikre</a>And by your nature means all of yours- your wayAnd yeah bro you are an awesome interviewer Sara

She is Soo beautiful

We all are in the police station, if our gate gets damaged, Adhiya, the junior engineer will come running in the night, the husband should not be worried, the father has done his service, now he sleeps and just watches the news.
Okay, I will be frank. That laugh @4.59 scared the shit outta me. I was drinking water and almost spat it on my phone 

Btw who&#39;s that guy whom she said she was in a relationship with!

I love how REAL AND FUNNY she is.

Feku

I HATE THIS HOST

Poo from K3G is her step-mom  Never thought about it that way

<a href="">4:56</a> ...the way she laughed ,,,also made me to laugh️.....Oooommmggg

Love you sooooo much Sara ️ <a href="">2:21</a> The cutest thing I’ve herd from Sara! Just to say that Poo is her step mother I love Sara’s voice and laugh 

There is no darkness, there is no darkness
ahh She was dating and befooling Sushant .. very cunning girl ..doesnot deserve to be here .. boycott her

So cute.. superb attitude
Not a word about sushantShe had living in relationship with him then

Why Sara Ali Khan is speaking in fake English accent and the way she speaks looks like annoying to me

She is giving so positive attitude, and funny , lovely girl 

Sara is a drug addicted girl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,For that reason I HATE YOU
I will hate you all the more,,,,,,,,,, ... ... ... ... ... 
Babar azam vs Sara ali khan

<a href="">5:40</a> I agree with the presenter - stop calling yourself Chick.. even after he tells her she just doesn&#39;t get it. Thick as shit!

shut up
Iska toh gala should be pressed
She kept saying that she doesn&#39;t have a filter omg what a fake girl sara is otherwise she should talk about drugs bcz she doesn&#39;t have a filter according to her... She is such a hypocrite i hate her now

Shameful youth icon! Seriously Sara, at your age do you still need a speech “say no to drugs!”?! <a href="">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="">#BoycottBollywood</a> <a href="">#PresidentsRuleMumbai</a> <a href="">#ResignUddhavParambir</a> <a href="">#FreeRepublicJournalists</a> <a href="">#IAmSushant</a> <a href="">#MiddleClassMatters</a>

girl crush
Sorry she has no dress sense. Do these kids really think more  beautiful have they not heard less flesh exposure is charming and not cheap looking.

Sara is so cute,innocent,beautiful also She is also a starkid,she make her stardom with very hard work but she doesn&#39;t have attitude

You like so pretty sara and also you have such great inner beauty as well I just can&#39;t get enough haha I&#39;m not gay Or maybe I am I love you alot sara you&#39;re so sweet so cute omg 

To be honest i dont like sara ! But i literally loved her in this interview 

Wow
Dude you&#39;re so real

Sara
My favourite

She&#39;s so Beautiful  
I like her attitude, she is amazing

Never in my life i came across an actor that is so genuine and so down to earth. That makes  her THE best. Beautiful inside out..Love from Pakistan

she is amazin

I also recommend you instead of wasting your time on the interviews, please save time focusing on the films and for other big things. You are so talented, just channelize your energy

This host is so irritating

Can’t stand that gay interviewer. And I can never accept her claim that she was “happy”. It is clearly untrue. It is an awkward topic and because they are celebrities it is so sad they have to tell the whole world about such things and pretend like it’s normal. At the end of it all, I like Sara Ali Khan a lot.

MANH I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH HER ️
This guys is like your desi aunty who&#39;s cornered you at some family event and is pestering you about every little personal detail. Sara handled herself really well which was his saving grace but I was getting annoyed listening to him.

Sara look so nice
She is indeed amazing adorable funny.. Just love her.. 

Lol

She is better in interview rather than movie.

Amrita is more pretty

Her jaw line is so awesome love her laugh

She has no comparison with other actresses she is so down of earth and most importantly she is my favouritee

<b>Wittiest young actress of BW</b>I just love her Mann️

Lots of love for Sara..I daily watch her interviews

She&#39;s very cool

it was poo

the way she laughs.....just tells how grounded she is....

This is so inappropriate to repetitively ask her about her parents separation, that how she felt, how she cope up with it, I mean this is sara Ali khan whose so brave and strong, what if she wasn&#39;t a person who was comfortable to talk about this, and who knows if she deep down isn&#39;t okay to say this again and again. There is personal life and a professional life, stop forcing people to combine both. Someone&#39;s separation is truly their personal matter.

so beautiful sara I like to so much

She&#39;s amazing ️️️️️
Love you Sara  you  are sweetheart
Anything expensive is &quot;Bhada&quot; I died

She reminds me of Manisha koirala and Rose of Blackpink.

she is beauty with brain

This girl is amazing to the core.

I&#39;m ur hugeee fannnnnn

..she is awesome ya

Babar Azam wants marry her

When ananya says u public are bullying and i know how to deal with u all U all re judging me under nepotismThen why would we accept alia and sara etc we do accept only talented one but not the one who acts like u like lifelessactingg

Sara , you are the overattitude , jealous , overwhelming actress same  Ananya pandey acting toh nhi aati . I hate . You much get obsessive shameless actress 

Like her Laughter.

I can relate to her man

Happiness is watching sara ali khan&#39;s interviews

i love your voice Sara and the way you laugh....waiting for your next movie

Smilling like stupid because sara laugh 

Sara shud b idol for young girls then trippy kardashians. Sara is matured , lovely ,down to earth n funny lil desi but thinks modern.

Everytime I see her I get more positive about life...there is other side of life too and we don&#39;t see itAnd if you accept that side...life can go easy

Her code of conduct is really amazing

She know how to handle media ..

Sara is so positive person cool...

Anushka sharma copy

She is soooooo natural ️
She is amazing,soo down to earth, full of fun and at the same time very very intelligent! 

Sara is soo nice than janvi

Omg she is cute girl

The interviewer is a classless fellow and highly irritating.Sasta Karan Johar.

nobody is single

amar nijere dekhte shob cheye beshi bhalo lage
Such a amazing human being.... She is....

Sara&#39;s mother Amrita Singh is Hindu but Saif Ali Khan is <a href="">Muslim.So</a> I want to know Sara is actually a Hindu or Muslim?But Whatever it is.Sara I Love you ️ a lot you are so beautiful naturally.You have a very cutenesses naturally and you are not like other young actresses.

The golden girl Sara Ali Khan

I love her attitude

Hyeeeee..... The way she laughs on the trolls

FLOP nepotism product

Just a middle class boy fan of Sara Ali khan 

Very beautiful sara g

You are star



Sara, you are very positive or your face is such that if you look at it in the morning, your entire day will be spent. You will learn how to live your life.
She is pretty

My useless talent - - - - - i can be calm crying laughing all my life

The interviewer&#39;s voice sucks
She always steals my heart!

Oh God how great and funny are they

She can handle everyone

She is awesome

I love her thought.

Sara u have better facial expressions than other actress in bollywood ️️

Aina remake with her will be awesome

She&#39;s quite wise for her age &amp; has an magnetic personality !! Seeing her first time in an interview. I liked the way she handled/responded the divorce question of her parents.

He was constantly telling to lower her morale

She is so genuine even in her answers

loll.. she is so repulsive

@<a href="">5:48</a> witty words

Sara is a great combo of Saif and Amrita. In looks and in eloquence

queen sara
the way she laughed on her trolls lol  loved it

Disgusting voice sara
Sara is such a great person and so much adorable that even kareena cant be ...

Varun Mitra &amp; Sara Ali Khan 
Soo FAKE! Undeserving!

I used to love Ayesha Takia so much, but I was so upset when I lost her cute personality due to lip plumping surgery, Sara Ali khan is my next favorite. — I’m a female.

The only star kid I like

Karthik no offense man,but u are a fool to let dz gal go

Dude who are the ones to dislike, man? I kept watching the entire interview intentionally looking for something that&#39;d make me wanna dislike it but NO ! NOTHING! She&#39;s too flawless in the way she speaks..will give it to her!

<a href="">4:59</a> her laugh .. So cute

Please be a little kind towards interviewing younger actresses. They are naive and asking such bitchy questions (which we are aware is your job but can be handled decently) while sternly fixating on words like separation of parents, etc. seems inconsiderate!

Funny comedy

Cool 8&amp; intelligent
Why are you wearing so, sexy clothes. You look better in fully covered cloth but your sexy shorts is extreme.

So, sexy shorts

She is sooo cute 
Sara 
Finally koi to actress h jise dekh k smile ATI h face plove u sara

Flop actress and actress

Her humour and smartness is the quality we love her the most! 

She’s so freaking down to earth and really outgoing very respectful ️️

What is so funny that even the laughing sounds fake.

Sara is really bindass.

Such an irritating sounding interviewer. He&#39;s telling her she&#39;s bullshitting him. 

Atleast she is natural not some plastic girl

She is extremely extremely real and normal

Sara is love

Sara love

What kind of interview is this?
New age Preity Zinta! Cute,bubbly,well-spoken and very real.

8723979721

That laughter and nothing hiding... She&#39;s incarnation of kajol... Both r genuine

Fluent conversation.... Awesome sara...thats wat i love about her

Sara u r da best
She never uses fake accent. Whether she is speaking English or Hindi. I don&#39;t know for how many things I am going to love her for. The only expensive thing she own is her bhadda.... Omg this girl is on another level. South Delhi girls have more attitude and show off then this Hen

The interviewer is so investigative. Such interviews should be conducted with the politicians so that they are coaxed into revealing a lot.

Dont ask any child about their parents divorce disgusting
not possible to be so cute

Carbon copy of her mom ️️️️️
The shirt you are wearing is tight..see it.
You should change the host NOW

Thank u filmfare official for bringing SARA ALI KHAN here . ...she is really a QUEEN️️

I get remainded of rachel green from friends!

She is very real and honest of herself

She is so sweeetttt

Its fun listening to Sara. She is so intelligent, so articulate, so down to growth

Ooo my favourite sara she not attitude queen

She is a very humble person...I hope she achieves great success in her life

How agree with me that Sara is very beautiful and cute also she has very nice voice. Hit a like here Sara&#39;s fans

Love Sara, she has such a jolly bubbly high spirited personality

Show some love. Please?

Very good points about marriage.

Whose name starts with A and ends with A 

I&#39;m from kerala and I haven&#39;t seen any of her movies so far, but since the day I saw her interview for 1st time...I&#39;m a huge fan of this girl. Not just in Bollywood, I must say there&#39;s no genuine person like her in Indian film industry. Her perspective on everything reveals that she is educated unlike any other actors and she is well raised.Sara

So intelligent her voice killing..  And her answer about her shopping yam

&quot;it&#39;s a Sara Sara things&quot; 
Sara- beauty with brain ️

She is truly HUMOROUS and BEAUTIFUL

The laugh at  <a href="">5:01</a> seems fake

Wow shes bindass

She needs to improve her dressing

Every star kid seems to be fake.....except for Sara she is so good

what&#39;s with this interviewer....everything is wrong about him...everything

nepotism has brought down the beauty-quotient of bollywood. there are no pretty faces any more

She is soo adorable 

She is the best actor....innocent, adorable, no attitude, lovely, beautiful

GRACE...!!

Why does every talk show host need to behave like Karan Johar like there r even other options around the globe ....including their own personality

She is inspiring to other actresses......Her simplicity..

She is inspiring to other actresses......Her simplicity..

I love how smartly she answers all the questionsBEAUTY WITH BRAIN.

India needs more actresses like Sara Ali Khan who is extremely smart and well educated. She is leagues and miles ahead of these stupid 12th class pass actresses like Deepika Padukone or that useless Katrina Kaif (who never even went to school).

No attitude!!! She is so perfect!! I bet she has many fans like me &lt;3

Future of the Bollywood,  new khan girl on the rise !

How can anyone not like her.

These jitesh puppies he? I love you hina after chandivali studio 
She just changed the atmosphere .

<a href="">#shameonjiteshpillaai</a> no offence to Sara she Is a sweetheart ️

She is real

Shirt is sooo in perfect way

Oh my god she is so so so cute

Girl with zero haters  so real gem.

Sara is exact copy of her mother Namrata and I can clearly see her in sara and I really like her acting in 2 states

She is so genuine, real and humble

after few yuck interviews in youtube, I came back to Sara&#39;s interviews to freshen up

<a href="">5:07</a> fake laugh but good escape 

Love that reaction say that again poo as your step mother

Hate her if u can.

Kartik is fortunate enough that he gets free shoutouts from THE SARA ALI KHAN

Sara Ali Khan! She is something, I never laughed this hard after watching any interview! She is a masterpiece  So simple yet profound .

Beauty with brain 

Pls dont tell me that the anchor is st8

Sada hua khanda

She is amazing

I love this girl 

Yeh aurat thodi pagal hai!

Stop asking these questions to anyone Rajiv....about their parents divorce that&#39;s not good...u ppl should think once. Somewhere ppl will get sad but they have to manage in front of cam.

Hello dear, your useless quality is what India likes

Born star!!! 
Cheap hand# cheap chick# only Sara Ali Khanadore u darling # super star# super talented# very well bought up.. 
“It’s a very one on one thing, it’s a Sara Sara thing” um why is that so me. 

She is gorgeous as well as intelligent!

Is this interviewer dude gay?

She is so cute and adorable

how to watch this episode online ??? someone kindly give a link please 

She has a bright future!

Hello Sarah your my favorite heroin I love you
really wall saru

I AM SURPRISED THAT SARA HAS THOSE GANS ALSO WHO TROLL  HER BECAUSE WHY WOULD TROLL SUCH A CUTE LITTLE BUBBLY GIRL SHE IS SO INNOCENT AND NATURAL AND I THINK SHE GAVE ANSWER TO HER TROLLS FROM HER POSITIVE ATTITUDE  LOVE U SARA

She is so kind no show off down to earth.....she is frst celebrity whom  I follow most...... Love her beauty queen love from PakistanWe want peace

SARA.ASMA.
<a href="">5:34</a> should really happen

Ap jaisi ho waise hi rehna... Celebrity ki tarhan react nai krna...

a very few interviews make me happy  but sara stole my heart

Last ko call me was for Kartik. Well now he has on KWK

It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s your step mother/mother........but if you are someone who&#39;s never disrespecting other ppl&#39;s parents you deserve it to be treated as a HUMAN..............if you disrespect you are not a good person...not even a HUMAN. It means you use your beast mode everywhere and you are a sick drunk person...so respect is everything. How she respects her stepmother tell how she could respect other ppl. Okay! Ppl can be good no matter which profession they follow, what matters is how that person is!

Wtf is that dressing 

She doesn’t deserve it nepotism product

Sara is so fun loving and positive...oh my God I just love her style..

Sara is like the Kajol of current generation.

She is so cute

Sara Ali Khan
She is just so genuine.omg its just hard not to totally love her.

Be lyk ds only..... love ur attitude ur nature

I guess  the last question answer is for kartik aryan

Sara dude, I love you, Nawab ko ladki and this girl next door wali batein.
I love this show 
WHO FEELS SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER BEAUTIFUL MOM?

OBSESSED

I cannot stand the interviewer&#39;s voice

Oh yea...KAREENA  and her epic pooh character. The best star to admire!!

Love u So MuchSo real nd beautiful soul

Saif and Amrita u all did a super job. She is sooooooooooooo down to earth and she says it as is. Just love this girls attitude

She is really sweet.

Love Sara yaar.. Too cute.
So adorable
She is so cuteLove you Sara️️
Perfect upbringing true.. Perfect actress

Cheap hen...oh god!!..this girl is love

What fuck is wrong with that shit bag!!!!!

She is my lady Crush ️

Sara is just love

I really like her!!!!

Sara is so cute. Love her tooooo much

Karthik doesnt deserve sara
She is the bright future of Bollywood... I really enjoy watching her acting in skills and giving interviews in any platform

She is talking about Ananya pandey..  Lol 

Funny that she is this big fan of Poo but I can also imagine her as Anjali from K3G saying, &quot;Kaun Ashfaq Mia&quot; and rolling on the floor laughing.

she is behaving so much natural n.... not in attitude like celebrity

Sara you&#39;re so sweet and beautiful.

Such a nice person she is

She is the best actress 

I never watched any Bollywood celebs interview as much as I watch Sara&#39;s interview. Is she even real? So Beautiful a person she is. P.S: Kartik Aryan is so way out of her league. I hope someone put this sense in her head.

She is the one️

My favourite ️️️️
There is no negativity even for Mtlb Kareena Kya Laki hai ️️
She is the most intelligent and cunning...But I love her

I love u sara
Can I adopt u as my elder sister?

This is what a good upbringing results in Just love the how she honestly and proudly accepts being a commoner like us ! 

She is a perfect example of a kind which proves beauty always should be viewed through brains not through fake cosmetics.

I love her attitude. She is so bindass. Speaks her mind. Way to go girl. Wishing to see much more frm u

she said call me indirectly to kartik and kartik called her in kofee with karan lol..

WTF she said mannnn.... <a href="">5:30</a>

Where can i get d full conversation??

She is my heart beat i wish i knew ur arrival in my country i love u

I am in Love
Ohkk so.. Sara says she wants to date Kartik on KWK.. and then here she says Call me..And Kartik said on KWK that the easiest way to impress him is to say good things about him on KWK.. and then at the end of his show calls Sara!!!! I am sensing this thing going in a certain direction! ;)

Sara Ali Khan is looking lovely, beautiful, gorgeous and has a very very beautiful &amp; sweet gesture and smile and congratulations for the success of your film simba and all the best for your upcoming films and for your future

Yeah sara and kartik both are perfect as they laugh very hilarious and irritating

Call her kartik aryan
Soo cool yr sara.. 

Sara is really sooooo cute ..and very down to earth...she laugh like her mother.....

The best thing that saif Ali khan did for Bollywood was give birth to Sara Ali khan

I luv her
She is the next trending star kid after Alia

4: 57Koi kuch bole... She is cool

she is so down to earth

The host !!!! How old is he ? Speaks like a baby !!!

these interviews are stupid and turn our favorite stars into hollow self centered and lonely people..Please stop asking star children about their parents&#39; separation.That  is a very uncomfortable and stupid question. Stupid people.

I bet, no one has got that 1.2 million views on this film fare Interview in just one week but Sara Ali khan got it.

uh. she is nice ya. her pr is great but this is nepotism at work because they have money for promotions!! remember how rajkumar and patralekha said that they had no offers even after their excellent performance  in city lights

love the way she takes trolls...so humerously

She reacted maturely on trolling comments. She such a sweetheart

Who is smiling while watching this video 

Cheap hen

Big fan of u

Seeing a new in town celebrity breaking the internet for all the right reasons. Guess she&#39;s the only actress in the current league having so many female fans too. More power to you girl!

After this interview towards karina i love you

Always open to Sara&#39;s interview..the best thing Abt her is accepting her dad&#39;s opinion to marry kareena and she takes it so positively.. that&#39;s a very matured thing to do and definitely her education plays a role in it..very thoughtful she is..that makes her even more perfect..and she is too cool to not bothering Abt hater&#39;s comments.. the days are your girl...Rule it all..!!! This is the first time am commenting this long for an actor...

marry me

whenever I see her in every interviews or any other shows every time I fall in love with her and my smile automatically goes on and on. I love her nails and she is looking like badam shake

The only celebrity i love watching interviews 

I think the last  line she said &quot;call me&quot; was for kartik aryan . Kartik aryan please  ,  just have a cup of coffee with her. She is just mad over you.

I hope her personality stays the same throughout her career... She&#39;s so down to earth.. She also has a perfect sense of humour..

The way she answered the divorce question, hats off to her!!

Sara mil lo yaar

<a href="">2:45</a>   
Saranation

very spontaneous and full of zest  ………. she is adorable

Awesome <a href="">#vaishalijingles</a>

Is there a part 2?

She is so adorable..the actress who hv 0 haters...love uh sara

interviewers always ask her about parents divorce. i dont even understand what&#39;s the point? though she answers these qstns in a positive way but its still not fair to ask her qstns like that.

I watched more then 5 times because I want it to be more than 1 million view

Last &quot;call me&quot; was for karthik aryan

Why they are shameful to use hindi vocal...??? Bloody hypocrisy of indian cinema.... If Middle class of India stops to go theatre... There so called stardom will ruin in few days...

Lots of love from Nepal Sara is love 

Why the Fuck does he enunciate so much

That “call me” was for kartik aaryan 

<a href="">
