was that a mother bear and her cut that would explain the chase

Why did it charge ? Rabies ? 🤔

that bear look like a mf machine😭

This shit happened to me on my way home!!!! Except it was pitch dark!!! I seen something running across the road so I of course slowed down and I’m thinking it looks pretty small then it turns and looks at me and it’s a bear, could tell what kind. He run kinda in the ditch then doubles back for us and me and me niece are screaming ahhhhh that never happened to me before. I’ve passed quite a few bears &amp; even stop to take a photo (from the car) none have ever chased me or my car it was so weirdo all I could do was skirt away

That Bear was in a bad mood.

Should have jumped out and took a selfie .

I&#39;m sure that bear had a &quot;paw&quot; out looking for a ride.

Only in Yakutat!

can&#39;t see enough dumb ass getting mauled by bears.

Great camera work

Thats a weird looking dog.

The bear charged them for stalking, trespassing on his property, and for stealing his vehicle.

Her cubs were probably on the other side of the road, putting the car in between.  Her instincts are to risk her life for them.  Glad no one got hurt, and how many up close vids of grizzly charges are there lol?

Goddamn do I hate it when fucking idiots treat wild animals that way! You should&#39;ve slowed down and stopped much further back, waited for it to cross the road, then got out of there. The only reason you stopped was to gawk and in doing so, you put the bear in danger by threatening it enough that it charged. How would you have felt if you hadn&#39;t been able to get away in time and the bear had ended up hitting your vehicle and going under the wheels, or something? Pretty terrible, I&#39;m guessing.

Holy Beautiful

Bear said fuck yo car

Great video thanks for posting. But you did go to little girls voice LOL

Why did you run away? you were in a car! Your a fishing guide and that was a big deal to you? You must not be very experienced.

I think the bear thinks it’s a dog and wants to chase cars.

hahah

Shoulda clapped your hills and ended up in another world

Oh dear, the bear was really pissed off. Wow. :)
He walk around like the final boss

Protecting the babies

Step on the gas you moron.

You&#39;re driving a GM. I&#39;m surprised you escaped. And disappointed.

Really hungry that&#39;s all that&#39;s the time to the most dangerous when their stomachs growling

Bear charged them for driving too slow (impeding traffic), but let them go with a warning when they sped up

That guy sounded so calm and shitting himself at the same time

Crap😶
If his car would have broken down 🤦🏾‍♂️

The cgi is terrible

Now imagine your walking on the road and not in a car, scary though huh?

&quot;Holy F.. we just got charged by a bear!&quot; Sounds like your body sucked up your testicles and left you sounding like Michael Jackson .

Scary asses

Go go go
Engine sounds good
I only did it because I saw gummy worms in the back.

I call pluff on that one

where did you get that bright red velvet interior job?

@.20 every kid running late and trying catching a bus , LOL

What kinda car is that?

Wow!! They are so fast!!!!

those guys had McDonald&#39;s and the bear obviously could smell it...

I wonder if it was a momma bear protecting its babies.  Unusual for a bear to attack a truck like that.  Maybe it was rabid?

Imagine walking there with your friends

Idc what  anyone think she shouldn&#39;t  drive when the bear was chasing the csr she slowed down but sped up when she was told  to she is fucking dumb

Fake

Did yall see the squirrel?? lol

Wow, sad that only 1 out of 20 commenters realizes this is fake.

Is this a chase

Thats a big fuckin dog

The way that bear squared up with the truck was frightening as hell. That thing was 113% ready to fucking end all life.

Looks photoshopped, especially at about 8 to 10 sec when bear image disappears into bushes.

That&#39;s a fake bear.

Haah!!So fake..The bear was a paid actor.

Had you of kept going there wouldn&#39;t have been a charge in the first place.

They should be glad they didn’t run him over depending on where you live you can get a huge fine for killing a bear

That bear was not playing. It was in seek &amp; destroy mode. Probably protecting a kill.

You should have jumped out real quick and get a selfie lol.

The bear was probably like “HEY NO PLEASE DON’T LEAVE I WON’T ATTACK I JUST NEED A RIDE STOP IT PLEASE!! I DON’T BITE MY BUTT PERFECTLY FITS IN YOUR CAR!!”

Bravo em! 😮
The bears like “ What the fuck are you?!”

Come on, that&#39;s a guy in a suit

was the video recorded with a calculator? 🤔

Dam they fast af

Hit the gas... 😂😂😂... Guess not so fucking tough after all. It&#39;s why you just stay away from them completely. Idiots everywhere now days and then they wanna blame the 🐻.

That bear needs to be put down ASAP for public safety reasons, imagine someone riding their bike or walking along that road.

Can you imagine a person on a bicycle riding by? 🐻

During the charge it actually looked like a video game bear

Hitch hiking bear
In fact he was sayin’: open the trunk and get me out of here my wife is a nightmare😂😂😂 and that face you confused for agression was frighteness

That would be scary af if they weren&#39;t in a car

I will get you next time

Treadwell would have flicked that bear in the nuts.

Human : pussyBear : what bitch!Human : oh shit

Bear was like You lookin’ at me?

The mother bear is never far from her young.

I can almost smell that chevy

he was hungry, can&#39;t blame him,😵😵😵😵😵😵😵drive drive😵😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭dont cry,let&#39;s av a beer🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺👊😬👊😬👊😬👊😬👊😬👊😬take that👊😬👊😬👊😬👊😬👊🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
They were probly between her n the cubs

Its just a bear ..

Maybe post a &quot;Bear Crossing&quot; sign in that stretch of road.  I guess that sounds silly but if you&#39;re warning people verbally, why not?

Very dangerous for bikers.

That bear said”Give me your fishing tools,cause I wanna catch salmons”😂😂😂

That&#39;s not Alaska....Alaska has snow 247 dumbasses

Bluff charge
🐻 was HUNGRY as hell!!!

Damn, you can see the power in that bear&#39;s shoulders. I would love to know what it was thinking ...

Dumb asses, never stop in the middle of the street, that&#39;s the difference between white and black people. If that were some black folks, when we first seen the bear cross the street the first time, we would have hit the Gas, Bye Bye!

Shit imagine riding a bike or jogging through there.

Oh hell na

Fake

what are you driving? i want it!

Can you make a more fake looking video? Not real footage of a bear what so ever

not a car dumbass that&#39;s a Chevy Suburban

Animal was bearing some kind of grudge.

who films that way?

Quite scary moment!!🐻

Hey man us bears are fed up with you racist humans hey man, bears are animals to.Keep it up and we are going to take over thank I&#39;m lieing? Keep it up. We tired of y&#39;all humans thank you running everything. Bears are people to!!!!!!! Grrrrrrrrr.

Why would you even slow down? I’m out that bitch

He must’ve lost his cub he’s in distress

That was Beary close!

Those are good graphics

And this is why I do not like nature hikes. There is no reasoning with a bear. Bears kill just for the fun of it.

gods children are to stupid to be afraid of anything:) have a good day bozo&#39;s.

Bears eat beats.. FACT a black bear is the best bear.

That bear looked fuckin pissed.

OML. This comment thread tho! Hella lot of funnies in here.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🐾😈😈😈😈🐗🐗✌

Can beer kill peoples?

Pussies shouldve went back

Literally me when I&#39;m running to catch the bus and the bus driver sees me

It was just the guy in a bear suit from that film with Leonardo DiCaprio. He spent some time trying it out in Alaska to get the hang of it before pretending to savage leo in that film.

Plot twist there is actually land in Alaska and not a huge ice berg.

Fake The animated was bear

Sucky video job

Y run go attck lol hahaha
That bear thought you guys was his weed man. Just a small misunderstanding.

lol nice, very cgi but a nice one.

Tbh you’re just kinda stupid for slowing down for it. Your fault

Casually, a Bear is pretty quick..
You guys are big time vahinas
Bet u this bear killed someone

You live in Alaska and your surprised that A bear charged you?. Just moved to the neighborhood didn&#39;t you?. LOL

You are lucky you were driving

He looked happy to see you he just wanted to hug you

Ha skirt skirt
I&#39;m so proud of this comment section

It just wanted some jack links beef  jerky

Must have had some Jack links beef jerky in that car

Lol fake as fuck

two dumass  why stop?

Imagine your car breaks down
<b>Eheyy booboo now&#39;s our chance GIVE US YOUR LUNCH!!</b>

I only saw a chipmunk.

Lol! Holy fuck is right

The bear was like&quot;What block u from&quot; 😂

Buncha comedians with all the bear puns

Bear was probably pissed off because he saw the guy holding the phone vertically. He was all like,  &quot;Turn you phone sideways ffs, lol!&quot;

the bear is flat

Maybe it&#39;s a female and her Cubs where close by so she was protecting her babies

Ok now go back and give him his truck back, stealing from wildlife...shame on you

I would&#39;ve backed up and ran the bear over and left.

At least you could have done was get out and given him a Bear Hug!

bear

That interior nice tho

he was aimin to puncture your tyre and eat you

he didnt like that 94 suburban 😂😂😂

Lol

Very nice...... Thank you so much my friend 🌹 🌹 🌹
They wouldn’t have took off if it was a polar bear

I hope cyclists chose that road. And then I hope bears are in numbers...And hungry

Lucky your car didn&#39;t break down or you may bearly have gotten away.

That mf fast af

I would have shot his bitch ass, come running at me like that.

Hell no that dude must&#39;ve had bout three gallons of honey in the back of the truck bc he wanted that shit

Thats the shit nightmares are made of, the chase!.. only you can run fast enough

I would have screamed gagged &amp; fainted......awoke then repeat......awoke repeat again......aw.....etc =-O

One bullet to the head and the bear is gone forever

Am i the only one that thinks the bear was running sorta weird?

The bear from doctor doolittle 2 longing for some human affection again

You just got charged by a bear....but it came up, &quot;declined&quot;!

When white folks go to the hood:

Yogi had enough

Wow...that looked so unreal! Lol...

That bear was pissed or what?

that was the mother

go go go. HIT THE GAS! Hes right next to us 😂😂

Bear vs a house on wheels 😄

SWEET

It looks FAKE AF

This is so scary lol
I swear that per global summit finance I will be getting that pair of G20&#39;s I own and these bears will be hearing my rendition of  the &#39;guerita&#39; de mi corazon.If I keep seeing or hearing of shit like this. And the faith in humanity will be restored by half at least with this raging judge...

Person driving isn’t very bright.

🐻 says &quot;Hey pay the toltax&quot; by feeding 🍼 me.

Yeah man,  bluff or not,  suddenly it&#39;s real ,   when you think what a bear can do big , or not so big it scares the daylights right out of you ,   so many skills to catch ya ,  one slip One bad decision,  your done,  he can stalk you and you have no clue he&#39;s there ,   it&#39;s scary stuff ,   seen a few up northern MN,    just doing what bears do ,  eating blueberries  in July, goofing off getting fat,  then you realizeThere not where you think they are ??? It makes you think, They know where you are , and then that silence hits , and you look , and look someMore , and move real gingerly,    cause ya know there&#39;s thickets On the side of the road unless your Air Jordan your not Jumpin those thickets , and even if you do you can&#39;t run in that stuff , a big ole bear can , and he knows it,   in a way it&#39;s a big set up ,  watch the majestic bear yay,,,     then you lose your focus And boom,  I think The moment when they just stare with a lowered head  and kinda move a bit just waiting for who or whatever to make a move , is the coldest look of any creature Man,  it&#39;s almost like there sayin, , OK  make a break for it bud , I&#39;m Givin ya the 1st move ,  do it,,do it.,, do it,,  And ya really have no choice ,  what are ya gonna do ,   I grew up in northern MN I  plan accordingly when I&#39;m up in bear country ,,   I&#39;ve seen Some of the damage they do , it&#39;s  beyond Words ,  not trying to be dramatic,   but I gotta say it is eye opening,

Shoot it

Fuck me sideways and up the ass twice with no lube

I live in Alaska. This sort of encounter is not uncommon. Brown bears just plain do not like to be stared at nor for anyone or anything to be in their territory ... had one once run alongside my car for maybe 40 to 50 yards before it veered off to run back into the brush. It was running between 35 to 40 mph!

Ive never seen an angry bear before this.  Holy moly!!!

It bearly missed you.

I had an &quot;89 Suburban like that one.

What an idiot for stopping to look at it.

He warned you , about  snaping your rod earlier , maybe you were too stone  to listen !.

Fake !

Just imagine walking hiking your lunch faces of death part 10

bearo is angry, bearo don&#39;t want to be on film

thanks for the ride lady.  dover

Please BEAR with me while I ....... you!

I guess he/she said run them pockets 🔫🐻

Classic V8 Sound 👍

Oh hell naw

Guaranteed that bear is a trump voterVOTERS FRAUD!

He was just out of some of the  Bear Necessities, and you guys couldn&#39;t be bothered to help a Neighbear in need, eh? Selfish A holes

This new YouTube format really sucks

dude why the fuck are bears charging shit so funny to me

Only in America!

You guys better have my honey lol

Omg I would have 💩 myself

Huge!😨😨😨😰
Lesson for this. DON&#39;T STOP ON A F--king road. Idiot people.

the bear was just going to ask you for directions to the nearest salmon fishing hole

Whoa. Yeah...doo doo in the pants?? Check!

I&#39;m pretty sure a car can beat a bear

Pretty sure it’s fake

Bears r fucking huge I&#39;d hate to run into one on foot

Fast

I wonder why they needed to &quot;hit the gas&quot; if they were inside the vehicle. It&#39;s not as if they bear would have lifted door handle and sat inside.

The bear was fucking angry

<a href="">0:24</a> he turned into a female instantly 😂😂😂😂.....&quot;💁&quot;

Bigfoot!

I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the only idiot who thought it was always snow in Alaska right? Right

That bear was in beast mode ready to tear something apart!

LMAO YOUTUBE THESE COMMENT&#39;S tho😅😂😅😂

FAKE

What could happen if the man was without his car?

Yogi after marriage
😱 Holy @#!*
He protec

I’m so glad I live in Florida. Give me an alligator any day. Fuck grizzlies.

I came here specifically to look for a comment where someone says it&#39;s bigfoot!

I would have riddled that disgusting animal with bullets from my M4 Carbine rifle.

In a car scenario: Aww cute bear charge, hey you wanna go alittle faster hehe?Walking scenario: Cool look a grizzly..HOLY FUCK RUNNNN RUNNNNN FUCKKKKK AHHHH MYYY GOOOODDD OOHHH MY GOODDDDD HELLLPPP!!!!!!

Lol just like that commercial

only you can prevent... joking

i bet it was eating roadkill and you stop right in between him and dinner lol

I wish that the Chicago bears were as good as this BEAR 😂✌👊👊👊

He wanted to clean your windshield.

<b>ANIMAL ABUSE</b>

that look scary

<a href="">0:17</a> when mom says food is ready

after reading your upper comment maybe the bear was like one of those farm dogs that chase cars for fun

I think there could of been some baby bears in the bush... cause the bear was crossing the road then went back

🎶What would you do for a Klondike bar? 🎶

&quot;Um, State Farm.  We just got carjacked by a bear.  Is that covered?&quot;

Imagine if he was on a mopad 50cc 😂😂😂😂

Shit look fake bear not moving that damn fast

I would have put that FN 5.7 on his bitch ass for trying to run up on me like in Briscoe!

This bear is on steroids

Bear must be a Ford fan

The bear was probably hungry. I would have given it some donuts or something else sweet.

Here before Joe Rogan

Grizzly
Bear&#39;s head in gorilla&#39;s body

Run it over

she ?

Imagine the bear leaping onto the top of the car.. car goes swerving .. bear punches a whole through the top, grabs one of the guys chokes him out. Car crashes and the last man goes running while still filming vertically.. you can just see the bear getting closer and closer than he knocks him down and proceeds to fuck him while the camera is still rolling.

This is the speed that they always warn you about bears but you never actually see. Now you&#39;ve seen it.

He had to change his tampon after that.

Imagine you&#39;re on a bike

He was just looking for some picnic baskets.

Anyone else notice how fast that bear ran. Next time you slow down to view a bear remember they run faster than you do.

Bahhhh

‘holy fuck we just got charged by a bear’ lmao

He looks pissed!
Fake as fuck

Look like a huge furry demon!

yea if u would have krashed that bear be full tonight

U better leave Smokey, Boo-boo or Yogi alone. 👊💪😱

Who ever thought this shit was real i feel sorry for you.

next time bicycling and you&#39;re done that day😇😂

Bear

I bet they wouldnt have drove away if it was a white bear smh

He was the orange backpack guy from The Walking Dead season 3 what have you done!

If he was walking, his pants would be shit
He was trying to get your pick-a-nick basket aye boo boo

You must pay fee for crossing his area , that’s how we do in Russia , give something to eat)))

No parking allowed

Y&#39;all was so calm . I would of went back with my rifle 💀

Should have got out and beat that fluffy ass for trying to start shit

Imagine if that pos car broke down, then they would be fucked

Idiots I wouldn’t have even stopped the car not one bit.

But why would you stop the car if you see a bear...?

&quot;Bear tries to do insurance scam&quot; 🤣🤣
Charges?? SLOWLY  walks nearby. Dull Crud

Clearly the bear was trying to flag down someone to help him but the bigger ? is what the hell scared a bear that badly

Seems like a safe place to live.....

Go, go, go!

Sooo what would have happened if you didnt drive off and stayed there? Would the bear try to break the glass and get you? :o

Bear Tax Booth.

<b>Intense Chase music plays</b>

GRRRRRRRAB as many parts off the car as you can while all the other bears sit in the woods laughing. The bear with the most car parts that day? wins a big jar of honey. Its a very common game up North.

Should be titled &quot; bear charging truck&quot;

the driver not sympathy or respect to the bear :( , so rude he even not give a free ride. the bear need uber like u

Bears like: &quot;fk You!&quot;

You got too close to the Sow&#39;s cub.

He&#39;s like hey look lunch!

Bear : wtf the fuck you looking atHumans - um 🚗💭

Nice place for a bike ride uh

Looks like the first bear was a cub that got scared off by the car and then the mother came out.

The natural way to hold a phone is why videos are filmed vertically

Sometimes you just gotta shoot them

rush
Imagine not being in that car I would shit my self the way it jumped out

I don&#39;t care what gun it is, I&#39;ll always feel a bit underpowered going up against a Grizzly bear! Shits fucking fast and huge!

it&#39;s just a bear. I would have stopped to pet it.

Just had a baby. If i fell like anyone is going hurt him im going kill them.

Fake lol

All that claw had to do was just swipe that tire and it would&#39;ve been &quot;all she wrote for their asses&quot;😳

The bear came and wanted to touch the car.

HAHAHA Where was the charge? 😂😂

That bear would have fucked that car door up.. Lucky

Damn thats crazy raw footage, that bear was ready to kill be safe ✌

Bear: Exchse me sirs, do you have a moment to talk about Jesus Christ?

That fucker was moving fast! I no longer want to see one.

Stay away from His roadkill

Imagine if you&#39;re on bike on the road..

Fuck that thing moved fast

To bad bear wasn&#39;t faster would&#39;ve like to see the bear fuck them up

Don&#39;t feel bad bear. That&#39;s how taxi cabs used to treat us black guys. There&#39;s a thing called uber. Lol.

This has to be fake. Says Alaska in the title but I see no snow, Sarah palin or Russia!

I love how he had to tell the stupid bitch to hit the gas.. women drivers amirite

he was bearing down on you and you simply couldn&#39;t bear it.

They gave the term dumbass a new outlook

Car jacking! 🐻
Damn that old burban sounded healthy!

I CALL MAJOR BS.

Wow that bear looked scary ass shit. Here im thinming they cute and shit lol

It&#39;s a mama Bear protecting her Cubs...

Bear pissed not dinner guest.

Bear waiting for the next hitchhiker meal

They&#39;re lucky that bear didn&#39;t poke holes in that back tire, hope that&#39;s not his wife 😂 The whole idea was stupid my GOSH !

I&#39;m guessing soft top vehicles aren&#39;t very popular in Alaska. Lol

What was the charge? Impeding traffic?

nice interior

With my vertical vision analytic, i can asure you that is a Chow Chow 🐕

y&#39;all crazy if you don&#39;t know this is obviously fake...its a few bear attacks videos online

Fuck you dumb youtubear
Fake?

&quot;Can I have a moment to talk to you about our savior, Lord Jesus Christ&quot;

Hes still upset over Seahawks not running the ball

I don&#39;t know how you Americans do it! Here in England the scariest thing you find in the wild is a fox 🦊

im jelous of that 89 suburban :(

In the car is easy, i wan&#39;t to see outside riding a bike kakakakakkaka

He just wanted a ride.

What were you guys driving? Looks like a full-size chevy van or suburban. Should have flipped a bitch and charged him back haha, would have been fine. 750lbs of bear vs 6000 lbs of American steel.

That would be cool af if you were on a motorcycle... hahaha like when a dog charges at you

Go go go hit the gas

Babies near by I&#39;m sure

get a new car

Hitch hiking bear was like &quot;wait for me!!!!!!&quot;

kids in Africa could&#39;ve eaten that old car

<a href="">00:23</a> Inhales helium.

FAKE

Dam bears this is what they do when your walking

Old skool suburban
great vid!!

You should have rolled down the window and gave him a hug.

Was that a bronco?

Once a grizzly mom &amp; it&#39;s cub came out of the bushes 10 feet from me in glacier national park while I was making out with a chick I just met on the high line trail. As I went to pick up our water bottles mom looked right at me and sniffed. We very slowly backed away and thankfully it kept to it&#39;s own business.

I went back and watched this again and figured out why the bear charged the vehicle in question.Bear: you son&#39;s of bitches screwed up again on my delivery,you,bastards,you killed Kenny!!

He had urgent news to tell the driver he couldn&#39;t &quot;bear&quot; it anymore

On the bear news: Larry the thug bear almost killed some stupid creatures ........again.

Lol why did the beat come out like that

Aw bless, he hungry, skinny
Omg that Bear was extreamly horney he wanted to fuck that car

Bear

Damn nature, you scary.

bear needs to hitchhike a ride to his next meal.

Brother bear I trusted you

Not sure it would be a good idea to drive a bicycle on the road.

WOW! good thing you were not on a bike or motorcycle! Even worse.. a MO-PED!

Am i the only person who finds this terrifying

Why stop? Never seen a bear before? Rubbernecking causes accidents!

CGI

FUCK YOUxXx_pr0_b3@r_xXx has left the gametrue story(yes i know in alaska they&#39;re not russian, just doing it for the lols)

Video is fake like if you want to stay alive

only reason the bear charged is because he saw you filming vertically

simple bear necessities
hit the bear, dont hit the gas.

Lesson number 1, don&#39;t live in Alaska

this is why people in Alaska get payed each year just for not dying.

Theres 3 possibilities here! Either Yogi was really hungry and wanted those peoples picnic basket! He was running trying to get a ride and get away from the ranger! Or he tried to run in front of that car to commit suicide cause Boo Boo&#39;s whining crying ass was getting on his nerves!

Imagine having to walk home and running into that shit...

Dumbass for slowing down 🤦‍♂️
FAKE the bear is a paid actor

What they didn&#39;t show you was the part where they ran over the bear cubs

he&#39;s mad :&#39;(

I Think the bear got mad of vertical filming

I think he saw the news that trump pulled out of the paris accord.I mean its Alaska, news get +20 days to reach that place.

WOW. this is fake that bear war clearly a paid actor

Slowest getaway driver of all time lmao

I would have brake checked

shoot it

Can I pet him?
Man they BEARly made it out alive

To bad Putin wasn&#39;t there

They were in no danger. They could&#39;ve hugged and sung &quot;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.&quot; They would&#39;ve been instantly transported to the nearest State Farm office.

What a bunch of fucking dumbasses

God carried
This is the only legit &quot;Viral Video&quot; on the &quot;Trending&quot; page right now... This is the kind of video we used to get to enjoy. Thanks for sharing..!!

The bear was about to go Aloha Snack bar on yo ass

fool. why did you slow down then. you desever what you get

Big deal, it&#39;s just a brown bear...

Must go faster...

?????????? anddddd WHY IS THIS TRENDING????

Well now you know what road not to walk down at night...👀 what if your car broke down at night while riding on that road 😱💩

I was expecting carnage smh

Wow they sure learned their lesson! l i k e  i f  y o u a g r e e

RUN BITCH RUUUUNNN!!😩
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
I would of sang the State Farm song and then left the insurance adjuster outside of the car and let him get mauled for all the times I got fucked on insurance claims and my premiums went up <a href="">#brownbeardeath</a>

fake

That bear just wanted a puff of what your smoking.

What the fuck is going on with the bears?

looked like that bear was really hungry I don&#39;t think it ate in a while is my guess if hes acting like that

I live in Alaska and I was hiking and a bear charged us!!!

White people always find a way to bring black people into any video/conversation lol you guys are fucking pathetic and obsessed.

I wonder what that bear is doing right now 🤣

I really can&#39;t bear these jokes...

I don&#39;t miss bears that&#39;s why I moved to Oregon for mountain lions instead

Bear charges car in Alaska. Is it full yet?

yeah my soul would leave my body

More importantly is the fact people still don&#39;t know how to film with a freaking phone. Come on people, Take a look at your TV, Now look at your phone. How do you think you should film?

Omg, this is so scary I can&#39;t bare it

Yogi still wants to take picnic baskets I see........

I live in ACH,AK

Looks like CGI

Why did he say &quot;hit the gas&quot;? Gas is not a solid?

seems to be just mock charging, what with the wide stiff arms and how it slowed briefly when it got close to the car before it started moving. cool to see tho, never seen that before

Is this one of those fake bear videos again?

The bear is strong enough to easily flip the car, lucky they weren&#39;t blindsided.

They should of drew a circle around them and it&#39;s also good that they didn&#39;t wear a sombrero in a goofy fashion or played the clarinet or waved the flashlight back and fourth or eat cubed cheese or stomping around or clown shoes AND NEVER SCREECH LIKE A CHIMPANZEE

Notice how the guy had to instruct the waman to hit the gas even though a bear was charging them lol

Fake News

GPS voice: &quot;Bear left now.&quot;
No ... you just provoked a bear !

Its all staged they are all paid actors

The title made me assume that the bear was going to break out his jump starter and charge the subject&#39;s dead battery -_-

<a href="">0:17</a> So this happens and your first reaction isn&#39;t to slam on the gas, but to watch in awe. Natural selection.

deja vu?
Are u fucking stupid. He clearly wanted a ride. Some people.

Wow how could you not stop and help the bear, maybe give him a ride? Money? Something! You&#39;re just an inconsiderate human who needs to check his/her/their privilege and stop being bearist

That bear will turn over your car

Reminds me of my ex wooof coming down in the morning before she had her coffee.

HOLY FUCK BOYS!

it not a car its a suburban or a suv

That bear took all the masculinity out of his voice.

this video is so fake. The gci is terrible

The fuck is Digg?Also, putin would&#39;ve stepped out and ridden it

The bear couldn&#39;t &quot;bare&quot; (pun intended) seeing you film vertically

All I cared about was the red Chevy interior 😍

What kinda car is that?

well you were in his territory

ONLY WHITE PEOPLE WOULDA STOPPED

When you leave the store and try to get in the car but your dad locks  it and drives off.

<a href="">0:22</a> Well, at least these people were mature. They didn&#39;t scream or reacted childishly when the bear approached their car.

Came here thinking a hairy homosexual man would be charging the car....

<b>You can&#39;t fool me that bear is obviously a hired actor!!!</b>

my tiger could have taken him

bad time to stop for a piss

Seth Rogan?

looks like you provoked him and stopped in a spot where his kid ran into on the side of the road. He would not have charged at you if you would mind your on business and pay attention to the road to be safe. You were asking for it to be yanked and spanked from that car dude.

fake new!

That bears obviously not a chevy fan he&#39;s like get that piece of shit da fuck outta here

Okay how da fuck did they know they were gonna get vhased by a bear tho-.- They already had their camera phone out,like they knew it was gone happen-.-

Pedobear musta started juicing
Damn he was flexed up, then dropped ass and dashed at em

Wilderness ends where your life isn&#39;t the ante. The bad neighborhood is wilder adventure than mere Tigers, Wolves or Bears.

Faaaaakeeee

meanwhile in Russia, the bear&#39;s driving the car away from the wild humans.

Skyrim looks so real.
I couldn&#39;t BEAR to watch

what a hero, when the car was out of battery the bear was there to save the day. 1 like = 1 respek

he just wanted your honey

All these bear puns are unBEARable

Fake I think

almost snatched

What they get for filming vertically

Almost couldn&#39;t bear to watch this!

You should&#39;ve let those 5 arrows fly

what dumbass stops in the middle of the rode to record a video?

Meals on wheels!

lol the bear said you aint bout that life

His voice in the end 😂

why&#39;d you stop stupid he could have destroyed your car and your face.

that video is BEARY fake

I guess nobody carries guns out there.

That&#39;s a weird lookin cat

Teaser trailer for the new Yogi horror film?

That could&#39;ve turned....grizzly

I never get tired of the &quot;vertical filming&quot; jokes 😶

Russia is hacking our bears to attack us

nice coffin interior

What&#39;s the name of the car they&#39;re driving?

Bear, Beets, Battle Star Galactica
That&#39;s what happens when you pass a law to kill it&#39;s babies. trust no one

Use the .45 long slide, with laser sighting.

ALASKA: the Australia of the US

In Mother Russia, car chases bear

I&#39;m watching this before going to Alaska in 4 days. Whelp.

The bear was chasing them because they were filming vertically

man what is up with these bears in 2017

See? Crazy shit happens in america too. Not just africa or australia.

That bear just wanted to get back to his family because he was lost while the family was hiking.

he dad the dumbass recording vertical and was trying to tell him that &quot;it&#39;s 2017 bruh, c&#39;mon &quot;

If a bear charged at my car like that, I would get out and put him in a triangle choke. He&#39;s lucky I wasn&#39;t in that car.

Bear telling you mind your damn business and go ahead bout your business

These bear jokes are unbearable.

gets charged by lvl 75 Yao Guai hits V.A.T.S

2017 the bear still records vertically.

He attacked him because he was filming vertical

thank you for not including a 20 minute reaction

He throws it in reverse and we&#39;re watching a while other video.

mayb it was a female bear...

I dont see any cubs, the darks patches at the beginning of the video appear to be the shadows of a bush. Also the bear slowed down before reaching the car then sped back up to chase the fleeing car. That appeared to be a bluff charge (which you never run from) and they flinched had they not been in a vehicle they would be dead or seriously injured.Fun side story Ive been charged before. They are incredibly fast, even faster than seen in the video, he was bouncing as he ran not sprinting for blood.

How blogger would have titled this video: OH MY GOSH!!! Almost died from a bear attack (not clickbait)

Those new toll booth operators are pretty aggressive.

cubs did not yet cross the roadgood job getting in between them

you freaking ate his  honey he wanted his revenge

Any other overwatch players think this guy kinda sounds Like Seagull

I like how the guy is somehow surprised that the bear charges the vehicle, like what do you expect it to do just stand there and watch you and say &quot;Hi My name is bear and your now filming another viral video that is vertical you dumb shit&quot;

Leonardo DiCaprio was in that car.

LMAO THIS IS SO FAKE. Y&#39;all can&#39;t see the CGI? The bear is practically glowing and it&#39;s so weird how it interacted with the car. This comment will be SUPPRESSED.

i can bearly see.....vertical...

What a big ass dog

Imagined you&#39;re on a 🚲 riding down there. Oh my gosh.

&quot;wait TAXIIII&quot;
Bear don&#39;t like foreigners!
Takamura woulda beat the shit out that bear

That looks fake as shit.

Oh look babe, a sweet Lil bear... Wtf... Hit the fucking gas!

pussy

He set y’all up for a jack move and y’all fell for it. See that shit all the time in the ghetto you don’t slow down.

Look for the bear necessities..

No more CG bears!!

if that was me, the video would&#39;ve been called car charges at bear in alaska

<b>&quot;It&#39;s just a prank, Bruuh . . . It&#39;s just a prank. Come back !!&quot;.</b>
This video is so fake U could totally see the strings on the driver

Imagine jogging by &amp; seeing that thing jump out of the bushes.

&quot;HOLY FUCK, WE JUST GOT CHARGED BY A BEAR.&quot;   Well... you fucking stopped...

I literally screamed, &quot;Run bitch, run&quot; to the people driving at <a href="">0:18</a>, but then I remembered they are driving a car

He heard about how y&#39;all did my boy harambe

Koda glowed up

Bears in Alaska have been dangerous this year. Even black bears are killing people which usually can just be scared off if you attack them or just look big and mean.

Did you check if it was tameable? Might want to use the beast lore ability next encounter.

You have to BEAR in mind that it&#39;s dangerous in alaska

The video&#39;s description sounds like a script straight out of a Bear Grylls knockoff show.

yup, thats why grizzlies scare me

Fake news! I know photoshop when I see it.

Must go faster

Putin is attacking American and this is proof

Fake because they aren&#39;t even in a car that&#39;s an SUV

Would&#39;ve been better if you learn how to hold your phone, can&#39;t believe people still don&#39;t know.

Of course y&#39;all would wanna stop

Bear: &quot;Hey guys, do you have a second to talk about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?&quot;... Dude:&quot;Floor it honey!!!!&quot;....Bear: &quot;Guys?&quot;.....&quot;Wait take this pamphlet!!!!&quot; &quot;Crap&quot;

dis my hood<b>BEAR HOOD</b>

This is my first time hearing the accent of Alaska.

how yall gonna leave the bear and he put in on gas

Boog  ya think it has sum food?

Trying to catch a taxi in New York be like.

pussy😂😂😂😂

He just wanted some... BEAR HUGS... •&lt;•, ;&lt;; I&#39;m hurting inside

Who else skipped to the comments?

Bears look funny when you can escape them

The bear charged for like 1 second sit down Randy

it&#39;s 2017... can we still not turn the phone sideways to record video the right way

Bear

there seems to be a lot more bear attacks up here in Alaska recently. idk why

That was so anticlimactic

bull shit video

The bear looks oddly digital.

read that as beer and thought I wouldn&#39;t need gas anymore

Is it just me or does it look fake?

this is the type of shit that needs to be trending!

That must&#39;ve been BEARy scary.I cannot begin to imagine how you would&#39;ve BEARed the consequences if the BEAR had attacked with it&#39;s BARE paws.

looks like they overfed the dogo

He hates junky food
People making vertical camera jokes makes zero sense now that we can watch them full screen.

I would&#39;ve gotten out and choked slam his ass.

guys if you look closely under the bear you can see that the shadowing is not correct for the surrounding environment. The bear is CGI

Seth Rogan is charged by bear in Alaska

Makes sense of the video with the title now.

fake asf you can clearly tell by how the bear moves, assuming his legs arent fucked up

Sorry about that, I lose my temper easily. Only you can prevent forest fires

Bear charges at <a href="">0:18</a>Thank me later

Why did slow down, sigh.

the bear just wanted some ass

the bear near charge the car

Are people really STUPID enough to believe this is a REAL BEAR??!!

The bear tried to attack you because u were recording VERTICALLY!!!!! 😡

God dammit who let out cage again

he saw you filming vertically and rightly wanted to rip out your throat.

Damn nature, you sure are scary...

Clickbait
funny how ppl think this is real...

Fake

The bear is BEARy glad to be in my country.

hmm.. i wonder if it had rabbies. i dont think a normal bear would charge a car like that.

Looking at the title of this video, I originally thought it was going to be about a bear charging up his Tesla or something.

Pooh bear wants his motherfucking honey

does anyone know why i can&#39;t see how many thumbs up some of the top comments have?

I wonder if it was a female with cubs near by and she was very protective at that moment?

If you tought that was cool subcribe to my channel!

Bear be like &quot;WAIT TAXI IM HERE!&quot; Than he be like &quot;fuq&quot;

bear thought his Uber had arrived

Fake news

The bear was just angry that you were filming vertically.

Even the bear knows that you never film vertically

looks like a guy in a bear costume

Danganronpa joke.
Let&#39;s see him run in when I Rev. that straight pipe 😂

Yogi is still mad his show was canceled

Lol these comments are funny as fuck considering I live in Alaska. Comments are better than the video.

If it truly was the scariest moment of your life like you claimed it was, why would you go back...? Hell, why would you slow down in the first place?

it&#39;s fake. you can see the zipper

fake

Of course you didn&#39;t give him a lift. Because he&#39;s brown, right?

This how i feel when im broke and dont have a ride to work...

Viral Hog has claimed another victim

Later, Bear filed for a hundred feet restraining order from Human.

FLIP YOUR PHONE!

pusieee u not russian

smh, stupid dog.

leo!

How much did he charge them

Pfft, that was just Grizz from We Bare Bears trying to catch a ride...

The bear looks very animated...

Little bear trying to find his way back home.

B E A R necessities

Omg he looks so cute, adorable.
That car is very red

Holy shit

The bear charged you because you  filmed vertically

YouTube trending page description with the free clickbait

there are some quality memes in this comment section

that was a BEARd mistake . ha ha get it? BEARd for BAd hehe

This video snuck up on me, I was bearly ready

he knew he got some space in there

I demand a remix with a bugle call, and some Yogi bear sound effects! CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGEEEEE!!

Fake, animation

Bitch better have my honey!

Is your friend badger from breaking bad?

Idk why I looked at the title and thought:Bear: 😱 You&#39;re speeding. I guess I&#39;ll have to charge you a fine.People: WE JUST GOT CHARGED BY A BEAR!!! 😆

That bear isn&#39;t scared of an old Chevy Suburban! ...lol

Always turn your phone sideways when recording

That&#39;s pretty smart *sees dangerous bear, stops to look at dangerous bear

He killed my boy...

It didn&#39;t even touch the car...

I can&#39;t bear to watch this any longer

dam man haul ass
Cubs nearby?

The bear doesn't like being filmed vertically.
Yeah, that would be scary as hell.  That bear looked huge and strong; probably could have been a bad situation if it decided to just rush in and body slam the side of your car.  Good job on alerting everyone else!

seen bears do this type of thing before it&#39;s usually a mama and she goes one side and the Cubs stay on the other if this is the case you stopped directly between a mama and her babies

don&#39;t fuck with Yogi Bear.

the lone democrat in Alaska.

Bear thought it was his LYFT

damn there fast as shit

They BEARly got away

What kinda truck is that?  I&#39;m guessing a 1991 Suburban.

That bear was looking for a lyft

the bear is chasing you away so it doesn&#39;t have to look at that 90&#39;s retina frying red interior.

the guy talking was hilarious

LIghting is a bit off but otherwise pretty good looking composite....and the bears run cycle could be better!

Pretty sure that&#39;s a lamb, dude.

FAKE

Hold my beer, let me meet that bear.

When animals get sick of the paparazzi. :P

&quot;TAXI!!!.... WAIT TF&quot;-Bear

so, running away as fast as you can is definitely the right thing to do he just proved it.

HOLD YOUR GODDAMN CAMERA HORIZONTAL WHEN FILMING VIDEOS.

what happened....that is so strange maybe another male bear around ?  interesting --please dont copy me

The part that baffles me is the person filming actually had to tell the driver to hit the gas...what an idiot the driver was.

love the portrait view never watch a video without it

Amazing car you have there....not

guess u better dont ride ur bicycle in certain areas.

Bear tolls are so damn expensive. Flipping highway robbery I tell ya.

That incident was unBEARable

i bet bycilists and joggers had an awful day walking past that bear.

Can I Have A hug😍
I wouldn&#39;t like to be riding a bike on that road

there&#39;s honey in the trunk?

Bare trying to hitchhike

Looks like Fat TRUMP in a black suit  trying to grab my Pussy 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I happen to be a world-renowned scientific expert in mammalian behavior, so please allow me to explain exactly what you are seeing here.......Bear Charges Car in Alaska.

Plot twist, it is the bears truck👀

Just say no to vertical videoing.

fake shit

He&#39;s tired of all the fucking noise lol

shit looked rabid
And that there is why you don&#39;t feed the bears at the roadside because then they come back and try to get food from anyone who drives bye

he got stung by bees in the nest he ran over and he need some milk!!!

Wow that&#39;s a big dog!!

They&#39;re still doing vertical videos in Alaska?

I&#39;d laugh so hard if their car Just broke down right their, omg. Lol

what the hell are American videos in recommendations?
Bears don&#39;t give a fuck lmao &quot;damn this thing is 4 times my size and growling at me, RAM THAT BITCH&quot;

Nice

just checking another tourist for a picnic basket.

Fake. The bear&#39;s movements are way too fast and abnormal.

Seriously, my pussy is hairy
It&#39;s like the bear was a long way from home and it was just plotting ways it could hitch-hike without scaring folks like that one... I feel bad a lil

I can see bear from my backyard

Seeing a Chev like that brings me memories. And the bear, we&#39;ll not so good memories.

He just wanted a ride

Lmfao,he sounds like Seth Rogen.😂😂

Thats A Real Hardcore gang bangin bear right there. Nobody is allowed on his Turf😂😂😂😂

<a href="">0:23</a>  Ohhhh Nooo! Is that Mr Bill in that truck?

No women, no screaming

The bears are very aggressive this year in Alaska. Something weird is going on. Multiple deaths, maulings and charges like this have happened since early May.

I guess you could say... they bearly made it 😂

I think it&#39;s a pretty safe bet that they stopped between mama bear and her cubs.

Maybe it was a guy in a bear costume.

I was the 100th to dislike this video.

<a href="">0:20</a> he tried using vats, lol noob

SNACKS!!???

&quot;&quot;Holly Fuck We Just Got Charged By A 🐻&quot;&quot;

Go away bear  , people will kill u &amp; eat u , humans r Savage selfish Cruel TERRORIST FOR INNOCENT ANIMALS

Normal day in Alaska

oh my cock oh my cock 😂😂😂😂
Lol, I bet the bear is trying to ambush the next car he see.

Fake! No one has red car seats and interiors anymore...🤔

ha was just &quot;haha holy fuck we just got charged by a bear

Was that Michelle Obama?

OMG 😲 imagine walking on the road and you suddenly you get attacked by that beast

Was this YOU in the truck sir? Holy poop, not many people (alive) have seen that up close. Lol

Holy shit

Nope

He was playing hide and seek. He found you bitch! ;)

He was protecting his honey!

Give his fish back

I kindda wanna know what kind of car is that, is that an old burban?

should correct the title. its car charging bear

The speed of that beast is insane. I mean seriously gets you thinking life sucks if you come across one of those hiking in the woods.

Holy shit that bear would&#39;ve eaten them whole if it had the chance

Fake as F

the difference between animals and humans are simple,  animals fight and kill for territory,  and humans have enough brain to figure out that there is more then enough to compensate for us without fighting and killing,  unfortunately some humans behave just Like animals,  there is no room on the dinner table in my home for such behaviour,  only the Royal are welcome,  far and few between.

something tells me that car smells a little fishy

that was pathetic

ha ha the bear was like you want some c&#39;mon motha lol

That bear is fast as fuck

CGI

Look at that big Nope in the rearview mirror.

not a car is a Chevy truck most likely a Suburban 1988 to 1994 design

GB hood bitch !

Those girls shouldn&#39;t be taunting bears.

Unbleavable how fast they are!

That car bearly missed him.

Hi (Sorry for my English)

why you dont stop?

Bear begins charging 18 seconds in. Thank me later

Guess Yogi forgot his picnic basket

that was a zombie bear

He just wanted a hug :c

Should have given him a jar of honey

When this video started I secretly wished the bear had gotten to them and ripped them to shreds for recording in portrait mode.

What was the bear running from

I couldn&#39;t bear having to walk home

That country never by bicycle or bike ....

Mental note, do not jog on the streets of Alaska.

in my opinion, the initial charge looks like a bluff charge, the bear comes at you bouncing off with the front paws, then it stops. Then, it charges again, as you hit the gas. This demontrates that you should never run from a bear, your best chance is to stand your ground, use bear spray or fire arm, but never run from it, or it will come after you. Great video, glad you were inside a car

I&#39;m here before this video reaches over 1 million views ✌🏻

to think that&#39;s a lot of people&#39;s last sight 😲😲😲

Can you say, &quot; FLOOR IT!!&quot;

Damn didn&#39;t realize a bear could move that quick lol.

The bear was running from Chuck Norris.

Unfortunately , this animal belongs to the hate group known as bear lives matter . Him and his deranged buddies terrorize innocent humans by blocking roads and attacking them viciously.

You&#39;re in that bear territory of course he&#39;s going to chase you

please bear with him

Black people in NYC  trying to catch a  cab.

They BEARly made it out of there......

tell that bear to boycut qatar .. see how that gona work .. 😎unexpected video..cool.

This looks fake. There is a delay in the movement of the bear..the shadow was odd.

bear: I&#39;ll take my car ride 🇧oneless
I was gonna make some puns using the word bear but I&#39;m to tired so just pretend I did

They are unpredictable, good that y&#39;all were in your car. 

2017 still 240p 😂😂😂
How rude to leave him standing there, you had plenty of room in the back. Give that bear a ride next time, it might have been an emergency!

Disliked for filming vertical.
probably had rabies

Wow XD

I was watching We bare bears while watching this video. lol

Dicks out for Harambe. <a href="">#neverforget</a>

these guys never saw the guy punch a kangaroo, should have punched the bear, would have went viral as fuck.
