I&#39;d love too hear Elon conduct himself and be that eloquent in Mandarin.. It would be easier to engage the crowd when you speak your mother language

PewDiePie Nice
space sucks

Alcoholism

Elon talking to the alibaba guy is hilarious

<a href="">0:15</a> wish I could relate

bro didn&#39;t realize he was eating the packaging cause that&#39;s just how dogass british food is

pewds not caring about earth and wants to live in other planets CONFIRMED

<a href="">0:19</a> JERMA?!!?!?

Are you with Tara.?

That wasn’t gta V it was czech game mafia 3 and it’s really bad and repeptive the priveous games are gold litearly the best czech game ever if u don’t count beat saber.

holy shit rewatching this on accident and i can acctualy drunk if i laugh, ive lived long enough to become the gloria

Musk is just a clown in disguise

i love how he just gave no fs, the pewds i know and love,not grown enough? grow up to watch this theeen

<a href="">5:17</a> lol people nowadays call this racist dog

It’s not a bad sign  I got JESUS and mother marry hanging up on a walkin my hosue bath doing the same sign , it means what he said , high and low , it’s not if the devil lmaoo

This wasn’t a try not to laugh.  It should have been called Felix simps for Elon and drinks whiskey for 5 minutes.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not poor&quot; lol

It&#39;s funny when you realize that alcohol generally makes you more lighthearted and able to laugh more. Basically, as soon as he laughs like 3 times, he&#39;s screwed.

I wonder how pew feels about elon now?

Seeing Jerma in a Pewds video, for whatever reason is super trippy

Elons cars have no personality. Cars for a while now have no personality. No soul and love put into design unlike back in the day. Same with cameras. They used to be hand made beautifully crafted. Now you get plastic cheap throw away ones. Plain looking cameras. Sad really

That mum is really annoying. He son definitely has mental health issues having a mouthy mother like that.

F in chat

man didnt even drink one glass
<a href="">1:59</a> agree

17k

Pewds: Statisticly speaking the earth is 40 000 years overdue of getting hit by a devastating asteroid so not looking at other stars and the universe is very irresponsible.Pewds 2 min before: 80% of statistics are wrongNot hate just think its kinda funny (especially because he called Jack Ma out for the same thing kinda^^)

jerma is pog

Remember people that Felix did have an alcohol addiction well not an alcohol addiction per se, but an whiskey addiction. Japanese whiskey to be exact.

<a href="">0:15</a> &quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not poor&quot; is the smoothest flex ever LMAO

i agree with dude on mars.  there&#39;s no water there, so why try to live there?

Adolf Hitler Was Bad (Very Fun Fact)
I think the Matthew McConaughey post was fine. It&#39;s dad humor, sure. Trying to come up with a one-liner or metaphor for everything, but it&#39;s fun! Making up new ways to express hat you want to say makes you more flexible, I think it&#39;s not worth being scornful over. His message was that &quot;I wantto see how people react to the things I wanna share, if they don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s cool too&quot; and that makes sense to me.

Qhh i see, you watch you drink?

What kind of whiskey he drinken give us the sauce

This is what i needed drinking by myself at 1 am 

how knew this guy was in deep pain at this moment

I miss the time when he was watching the YLYL threads in 4chan.

This is my fovorite Laugh video, because i&#39;m not drinking alone

Pewds is tiny 

iq points... at least 20 lmaooo

I liked how he said non alcoholic cuz becouse that is the relic for congratulation

Does YouTube allow you to drink in videos?

f

and now he doesn’t drink at all
Never getting another one of these vids...

Bruh lol I thought he would drink G fuel dude I&#39;m late on this one xD.

The title of the video should be try to laugh because it looked like he enjoyed it

pewds you were so drunk here

Urgh more like Matthew Mccona-Cringe (heh heh)

Mafia 3*

ALIBABA? More like ALIBLABLA
The Matthew part, he was talking about his sleeping app tho, wich is kinda of a monologue

Its Mafia 3 not Gta V you noob

<a href="">11:19</a>Sounds like Markiplier when he just goes on and on funny to me when mark does it

<a href="">6:07</a>Anime fan before going to convention

SHORT KINGS!!!!!

this is a problem

<a href="">11:12</a>ever since interstellar he thought being smart was cooler

It was MAFIA 2!!!!       FELIX!!!!!!

What’s he drinking in this??

Well.. now I&#39;m drunk lol

Hits different now
F

You know he&#39;s tipsy when he says &quot;bad, bad goes epic&quot;

Watching him drink makes me feel like an alcoholic  that glass was one drink away from empty for the whole vid

I had to click off this video out of respect for my people

Pewds: * doesn&#39;t even try not to laugh *Me: I guess he really was addicted...

This video has a different meaning knowing what we know today

Love ya Musk lol
shouldve called this...You Laugh You BOOZE.

“Cheers to strokes”

The Alibaba Owner is the Chinese Mr. Bean

Who is here after watching PewDiePie’s I have a drinking problem video?

Watching this right after his most recent video  But seriously congrats to pewdiepie for his recent vid

Drink the fleshlight juice

Elevator to marz LETS GOOOOOO
The Alibaba guy is nauseating.

ii my kid acted like that i would take awat console

Of course Jack Ma is interested in Earth and not elsewhere because in a few decades from now China will own it all. They don&#39;t want people to do their stuff elsewhere, they want them to do it next door so they can swoop in and take it.

I am 5&quot;2 and I couldn&#39;t care or less. It has never stopped me from succeeding at anything........ except reaching the top shelf in the supermarket.

we will never go to mars

<a href="">12:14</a> he drunk

I agree with they guy talking with Elon musk, life is a variable and people don’t know shit, if you’re right in predictions you just happen to be

Pandemic rewatch 22

Why is the quality so low lol? 

that&#39;s the problem with Alexa I didn&#39;t use my echo for 5 months she used to have a British accent now it is American  I ask if she can change it back she says I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t know that one

<a href="">12:26</a> Indian bros turn on the cc jack ma=Vijay Kumar 

He just laughing for alco

<a href="">13:45</a>. Idk if he’s tryna hold it together. I think he’s tryna decide whether or not he’s being trolled. Every joke that goes over the dudes head he’s like “‘no fucking way…is this guy just that good. Or alibababoey.”

PewDiePie&#39;s IQ points 1,300 billion my IQ points 3

6 Aug 2021

The ali baba guy made some good points though.He wasn&#39;t siting a statistic he was saying that of predictions made, several of them have not come true. Which in itself wasn&#39;t a prediction, either.Also he said creating AI is a look into ourselves as people, which is true. What makes up a human, why is human decision making different from animals or machines, why do we want to be good even in (some cases) the absence of a God? What does an AI do that makes it similar or different from a human?Maybe he isn&#39;t as smart as Elon Musk, but that doesn&#39;t mean Elon can be a jerk and disregard what he says just to embarrass him.He can&#39;t articulate what he wants to say as well, but that doesn&#39;t make his ideas or words less valid.

The chinese dude was so small like wtf.

THAT WAS NOT GTA 5! fuck me I cant remember the game. Someone help me out here.

Jack Ma has become his fake persona. He is a broken dude. So out of touch with everything he&#39;s like an NPC. I feel that listening to him talk must be like what non English speakers hear. A bunch of words that you recognize as English but don&#39;t make any sense.

if your just a dumb kid and want to participate in the drinking just get a bottle of W if you know what i meanwater.

Pewds:*SwearsYT:No you can&#39;t do that you have kids as audiencePewds:*drinks alcoholYT:Hmmm...I think I&#39;m forgetting something?meh it&#39;s kid friendly

When you&#39;re girlfriend wants you to stop drinking and you need excuses.

Look at Jackma now

HAHAHAHA THe Jack MA guy is hilarious And Elon&#39;s REaction HAHA

At <a href="">10:58</a> lmao you can see the price tag on Jack&#39;s shoe

&quot;we are overdue 40k years a meteor hitting earth statistically&quot; ... 80% of statistics are wrong

Jack Ma being like one of the richest dude in China said in an interview that he&#39;s not interested in money. he&#39;s never wanted money and he&#39;s never even touched money. blahblah. the interviewer and the audiences were all  like 

Mine as well eat that plastic/Styrofoam. It&#39;s in everything we eat and drink anyways

&quot;80% of statistics are wrong&quot;Including that one? 

Talking about going to Mars while the planet is in the state that it&#39;s in, is kind of like talking about going to Disneyland while your house is on fire. Put out the fire first, then we can talk about the trip to Disneyland Felix. Grow the hell up.

I love how this video went completely off topic but is still far more entertaining than most things on the internet

F

The cheerful michael usually tug because bestseller simplistically apologise aside a medical blanket. devilish, clumsy sparrow

That&#39;s mafia 3 not gta

tbh tho jack ma isnt a native english speaker so it is natural that he wasnt able to understand what elon was saying and it is more difficult to generate a good response in english

Calls mafia gta 5

I’m assuming that meteor hitting the earth prediction is part of the 99% incorrect predictions, and the statistics it’s based on part of the 80% of all statistics that are also incorrect. Sooo...I guess it could hit tomorrow....or never. You know about the same chance that climate change is gonna kill us in 10 years.

in four ears ill finally be a real 19 year old TT can i get a brofist then

<a href="">12:22</a> very true

Let the man play GTA V... What a Boomer...

Lmao

To be fair, Jack Ma has kind of a point with Mars. Some tiny sliver of a point. Once we are able to somewhat easily get to Mars, there is no turning around for a lot of people. We’ve seen technology that was modern less than 20 years ago get rendered nearly obsolete by today’s standards, so I wouldn’t be surprised if, someday in the not-so-distant-future, colonizing other celestial bodies will be the new “norm”.

Elon is so precious i want to hug him lol

I&#39;ve seen the jack ma vid before this. Man he&#39;s so annoying.

elon musk so funny

<a href="">12:46</a> but 80% of statistics are wrong remember

Jack Ma is the asian equivalent of Kanye West

F FOR RECPECT

<a href="">7:50</a> IS THAT MICHAEL REVEEVES ???????

Unpopular opinion, but I think a lot of Elon Musk&#39;s ideas are just ideas, and too farfetched to actually play out in reality. I think it&#39;s amazing how he&#39;s pushed the ideas of environmentally friendly and luxury together, and the idea of space technology being privatized, but there&#39;s still a lot of stuff he pitches out, that is farfetched, and in some cases haven&#39;t really played out. Like the Hyperloop or the thing that was supposed to take cars underground and move them faster than they could drive, to avoid traffic. It&#39;s also amazing how someone as young as him could create a multi billion dollar company in so little time.

Me and Alexa are alike strokes

That Chinese gay went missing after saying the same gibberish about chinese government

pewds; drinking is great for u everyone else 
This is just the beginning to his alcoholism

To add to the argument that space discovery is a good thing; yes we live on earth, but earth is *in space*. Whatever discoveries we make could end up being answers to the problems we have on earth.

OMG isn&#39;t Jack Ma missing or something rn lol He&#39;s probably on Mars

This is first time when you want to laugh

Lmafo jack mahhhhhhhh
Immmmmm not five tow WTF IM lower <b>illumination meme sound</b>

Mmmhh, I might have to disagree with pewds on the matter &quot;we can do both&quot;, as in &quot;explore beyond earth and solve recent problems at the same time&quot;.I think that it depends on how serious matters on earth are. Pollution, world hunger, wars...etc... have been going on for years - decades- and we still are not getting better. I think those are very serious problems. Investing money and effort into &quot;exploring beyond the horizon&quot; isn&#39;t wise at this point.Sure...humans are curious and knowledge-hungry beasts, but we should know better.The reason why we can&#39;t do both at the same time is (like always) money. At least that&#39;s my opinion... <b>*SHRUGS*</b>

<a href="">6:40</a> This isnt Gta 5 its Mafia 3

&quot;I&#39;m being framed by the president of Barrak Obama&quot;

first dont believe all meteor talk its mostly to make it feel like life doesnt matter. Second we would already be on mars if we had fixed all stupid problems on earth instead of concentrating on otherworldly things. Start with urself then the rest will fix itself

E

Thanks Pewdiepie i watched this video to get drunk easier and i got even more sober by not drinking a single shot ._.

No we are 40k years overdue the supervolcano yellowstone in the us

The gfuel is fantastic.  I never thought that Jojo PewDiePie would look so cool

The owner of Alibaba feels like a nice guy. I dont like Elon’s responses. Its classical thing that westerners do. He laughs and makes jokes in the middle of his sentences and uses the fact that this is his native lenguage and that he chinese guy doesnt speak that well. The chinese guy makes a great point, Millions starve to death and a guy wants to take picutres on Mars. That is just wrong.

When PewDiePie started meowing, my kitten came running into the room and started staring at me.i swear Damn he must be a cat. So funny.

That&#39;s not gta you uncultured swine

Pewdiepie: “ <b>Youre just speaking gibberish and pretending to be smart</b> ”Also Pewdiepie: * Proceeds to talk about space *

F

Fact  you

Wtf i just got a T Series ad on pewdiepie video that is illegal

this is so sad

2 min 41 sec. Wtf is that sound?

Bless you

Bruh that claas colored merch tho

Pewdiepie Called Mafia 3- GTA 5. WHY?!?!
<a href="">1:40</a> perc 3000000

great, now I know that matthew is a moron

Pewds: LET HIM PLAY GTA V IN PEACEMe: <b>ahem</b> MAFIA 3

&quot;You laugh you drink.&quot;<b>Looks down at toilet bowl</b>

# Stop Barak Obama

Hi

Fs

F

The year is 2027: Elon Musk buys the European Union and now memes are allowed again, meanwhile Trump reveals he is a transhuman and Kim Jong Un&#39;s surgeon was his robot.

Just to add on to pewdiepies overdue meteor, we’re also overdue on Yellowstones eruption

Leave my boy Matthew McConaughey alone!

Th chinese man is very smart and really tryhing his best so why you gotta hate on that? You just see he has it difficult

You laughg you drinkFelix: I see this as an absolute win

Low key thought he was drinking somethingout from his flesh light in the cover

Plot twist: he laughed purposely to drink more

why does the dog on the left at <a href="">5:04</a> have  eyebrows?

f

that guy you said wanted to sound smart starred in the gentlemen

I LOVE ELON MUSK, SIMPLE AS THAT

Yah drik we are 19 years old
Omfg! My bf once told me about this dude he saw while he was at the Seattle central library who very blatantly got down on his knees and crawled under the table some asian chicks were sitting at and proceeded to sniff their feet. And aparently the dude seemed very chipper and pleased with himself. I wonder if it was the same dude from this video on the news.

thumbs down for saluting and drinking to strokes. My sweet mother has suffered 5. you got small pp sir

F

Who is Russian????!!!!!!!
F

F

F for that 5 feet guyFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

<a href="">4:04</a> wtf was that

I couldnt have cared less abt that random guy ive never heard of talking to elon musk yet it was most of this video

i didnt read the title and i didnt know that i came prepared

What kind of whiskey glass is he drinking from? I can&#39;t find them online.

Wish I could drink expensive whiskey like you lol Johnny Walker is pretty good though. You earned it bro keep up the amazing work.

Pewdiepie laughing on purpose just so he can drink.

PewDiePie:doesn’t laughPewDiePie:I think I laughed

Why&#39;s it got to be the brown dog

Its mafia 3 u fool
Hey kids don&#39;t drink

Strange vibes

That  won&#39;t be ninja it will be you

so glad i found this video because i needed a drinking game tonight

11x

F

MEOWWWWWWWW MEEEEEOOOOOOWWWW    
alexa got possessed
<a href="">8:04</a> i think the cyber truck is creative but it wasnt smart of them to hit on Ford like that.

PewDiePie is a noob don&#39;t subscribe him subscribe to t- series

Pretty sure your statistic about the meteor is actually us being overdue a yellow stone super volcano eruption

It&#39;s weird how I was wondering when this was from and I could immediately date it when he mentioned baby yoda... meme calendar is real...

Wow

F

That was a great floof!

F

Pewds: sees funny clipAlso Pewds: it’s definitely fake

The talk between Elon and the Alibaba guy are just painful to watch.

&#39;Pewds workout routine&#39;

Wow, isnt that the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?!?!

Whenever people complain about space travel,  I always remember the &quot;space brothers&quot;

Pewds is the Elon/Tony stark of yt

haram bro sorry
i cant see the difference between pewds and a drunk pewds.

God damn it! You dogo snitches!!

Plastic have vitamins? It’s made of oil

F

“ you have to have a dialogue to have a monologue and uh you have to have a monologue to have a dialogue “

Matthew McConaughey is a troll though. False depth is like his thing.

When he mention &quot;forbidden burrito&quot; I thought it was Papa Franku&#39;s recipe

Yo that “I do that” was a perfect imitation. That’s incredible

Marzia should be in this video

F

Video: Not funnyPewds: laughs anyways as an excuse to drink

To be fair to Jeff ma though, he is speaking a foreign language, let’s see you people do an interview in Chinese

F

low eye sounds like LWIAY  cus it does

<a href="">11:13</a> i pretend to be dumb so im the opposite

Yo pewdiepie predicted 2020 meteor for july
Is that a whiskytumbler you&#39;re drink8ng from? Where did you get it?

* the cybertruck arrives * Halo nerds: boys... we about to make this beautiful * halo music intensifies *

He&#39;s already so wierd you can&#39;t tell when he is drunk

Hii its 2020 and that alibaba guy&#39;s country is responsible for corona virus

&quot;Let&#39;s keep laughing&quot; pewds are you OK?

When the girl said “Alexa Simon says hahahahahhaha” my Alexa did the same thing I thought someone else was in my room or something

Elon: including this oneChineese man (don&#39;t know his name): NANI!??!

Elon always cracks me up
What do you expect from the Communist guy. The guy is obviously in his own bubbles.

I didn't make a song, and yet yours is perfect. Still love you pewds
A laughing Elon is a happy Elon.

<a href="">0:02</a> I always love drinking alcohol sometimes my life will be change dude.

Awesome

f

How do you do this to mafia 3

Sasuke Sasuke hahahahaha
The world:hotdogsJack ma: I like to call it uhmmm meat tubes

Matthew mcconway was speaking about the ego and perception, in a conversation (dialogue), there is also a monologue (Thoughts) that not everyone is aware of, which also can become emotions&quot;Let&#39;s keep the high eye not the low eye ( could be capital &quot;I&quot;), he means third eye.

Did he call mafia 3 gta 5

hahahaha

youtube has never seen a faker slurp.

GO TO THR BATHROOM!!ⁿᵘʰ ʸᵉᵗ
What the fuck pewds, Mathew McConahay is great and a great actor

80% of predictions are wrong so when t series was winning we just had to predict them to win

How can u eat the fucking baguette container without taking it off, like how is that even possible

It’s mafia 2 or 3

Anyone hear the ghost <a href="">8:38</a>(Kidding)

<a href="">14:21</a> LIAR!

<a href="">2:16</a> its photoshop you can see the cats tail on the right clipping through the ledge

&quot;80% of statistics are false&quot; I&#39;ve won but at what cost

F

&quot;he much more care about the eaarth&quot; at the same time china created a Covid-19&quot;hey man, I.................. &quot;<b>dumbass has left the chat room</b>

Change the World,My final message,goodbye...

It agitated me when he said he&#39;s playing gta5 and it clearly mafia 3

Meme meme
F

Accurate naruto scream
I think this is the first time we saw pewds drunk

my boyfriend really wants the sweatshirt pewds is wearing! does anyone know where its from? :)

pewdiepie: Let the man play gta 5 and shit himselfMafia 3: :/

WHAT YALL DIDNT KNIW IS:  PewDiePie been drinking before the vid too.

<a href="">6:40</a>  It&#39;s Mafia 3 Felix not GTA V......you&#39;re not a gamer......not one of us!

Felix: <a href="">12:47</a>Me: <b>80% of statistics are false.</b>

<a href="">5:15</a> did anyone else notice the facetune on the dogs or it’s just me

When someone doesn&#39;t wanna get up from playing a game that they can stop at any time even though they are shitting themselves, that&#39;s when it has gone to far and they have a serious addiction.

<a href="">5:48</a> my sub asked who nick gurr was

Kid gets in trouble for not shitting whilst playing Mafia IIIPewds: Let the man play Gta 5

You should make an alcoholic g fuel

Look up Castle Griffinsteed, it&#39;s made by the man you made fun of for being short.

The thing at the thumbnail i thought it was a pussyhut

F

<a href="">4:15</a>, it&#39;s a tamale... the &quot;packaging&quot; is not plastic ‍️‍️
Who is vijay kumar

Hello, were you able to find the Spanish comment, you can continue down
Bro....that&#39;s not GTA

<a href="">7:30</a> that was a footy/football from AFL (Australian Football League)

Lol i used to say a bunch a nonsense to seem smarter too. but that was when i was 8.

A meteor hasn’t hit us yet, because the moon is earth’s meat shield

why is elon musk wearing space boots under that suit tho XD

god he ruins every clip, why talk before the punchline. im done watching these

Love how PewDiePie bullies the guy that is short but he can’t even stand ip

that&#39;s mafia 3 not gta 5

This is literally just a video of Pewdiepie running out of content but also wanting to get drunk [ 9 year olds don&#39;t come after me lol ]

When I first saw the thumbnail I thought you were drinking from a pocket p**sy

I know this video came out last year, but I just watched and pewds gas just butchered the halo theme song. I have never been so offended

Amazon for Chinese products = Amazon

well i don&#39;t need to worry about that meteorite anymore because 80% of statistics are wrong

I was just staring at Elon musks face the whole time he looks like he is done with life 

Thats Mafia 3 lmao

I know this video is older now and it might have been said already but, the kid who shit himself could have a mental disability. My bro is on the spectrum and when he was younger he would shit himself playing games.

That&#39;s Mafia 3 DumbAss

Wtf, Grandma said &quot;cum&quot;? 
I&#39;m sorry but his face is just too damn small for his head. He looks like a watcher or something, megamind but with a normal sized head just a really small face.

theres alotta viamins in plastic ye

holy crap how drunk is he

<a href="">13:04</a> I’m gonna assume you meant condemnable but it’s okay Pewds, I’m not bilingual so I can’t say shite.
when you laugh you lose turns into felix ranting about a Chinese person

f

f

f

F

f

i drink label 5 while watching this 

F

Around £50 to £85 a bottle, now white label taketsuru that&#39;s the shit nikka 17 you know you have made it.

They are making a space elevator though...

&quot;We&#39;re overdue for a meteor to hit the planet statistically&quot; .... &quot;80% of statistics are false&quot;

I thought jack ma was the aliexpress founder or maybe he is

F

F

Please don&#39;t laugh in first video

Truck is awesome for sure,

Felix Is intelligent???? It&#39;s rare to find a guy like him who is. I salute you Felix!

So then this scientist turned himself into the pickle! The funniest shit I ever seen

its not gta 5 its mafia 3

youre an elon simp. does he do stuff w marzia?
Look up Jerma985, the guy at <a href="">0:18</a> . He does a tonne of comedic content, he usually just live streams, he even did a livestream where he let the chat manually control (through chat commands) robots, in order to play some IRL carnival games. Chat shoots him in the face!

<a href="">11:22</a> This is known as a colossal waffler

F

Wait pewds we’re all 9 year olds

F

<a href="">0:56</a>

<a href="">8:27</a> Awwwww , that triggered him

&quot;Overdue&quot; is more or less meaningless. Statistically

The &quot;burrito&quot; video sent me on a Google hunt to learn about styrofoam and polystyrene. The guy will likely be fine unless it causes a blockage, as it is likely not harmful, but is indigestible. Styrofoam can produce toxic chemicals when in contact with acid; however, most takeaway containers are polystyrene.

Thought it was a frickin fleshlight in the thumbnail



F

F

You are drunk

Why is it that anyone like Elon that is interested in space travel or creating living on multi planets. ALL THE SUDDEN they ALSO have to deal with all the other problems in the world. Like why? Isn&#39;t there someone else thats interested in cleaning up the oceans? Leave it to them for fucks sake.

you know the ali baba dude came from nothing and now he is the richest person in china

I love how Elon says 80% of statistics are not true but pewdiepie is talking about statistics

F

I love Indonesia
I am a basic chick who’s experience in videos games consists of wii sports &amp; Mario kart but for some reason he makes me geek so hard

STOP USING THE LORDS NAME IN VAIN! PLEASE!! It’s like EVERY EPISODE. I do not want to stop watching your videos, but I will!

Thank god President Trump SHUT UP,  borax ombabama
This wasnt gta tho

u r getting borring
Pewds is so prettyful. 

Idiot
I have Finally sub because pew loves CYBERTRUCK 

CYBERTRUCK ‍️‍️‍️
that guy probably watched some tedtalks and rehearsed what he heard in the mirror. Its so clear that he&#39;s not there to talk to elon but just recite his script.

That games mafia 3

He laughs as often as possible to drink as often as possible

I would totally just watch Felix watching YouTube videos

Petition to have pewdiepie play halo infinite!

Naruto hand signs

TRON 1 WAS CYBERCAR, WE ALREADY HAVE LIGHTCYCLES

naaah man i fart so what
SAUCEGAAAY

Voss water is slightly worse than tap water

<a href="">2:28</a>

PEWDIEPIE  is a legend among YouTubers.

How many people corrected you saying it was mafia 3 the bathroom kid was plating

<a href="">3:08</a>

You took break

<a href="">11:11</a>Jayden Smith does the same thing. He tries to sound deep &amp; just sounds like a moron &amp; then my boy Will tries to back him up.

How the hell does this guy get subscribers the mind boggles

There are Arabs on the plane
Someone say the right words to bring him back

You left you drink

Hating on my guy Matthew 
I am an Indian and me and my friend community will unlike your all videos as you roasted india

I can&#39;t beleave there is advertising on this video...

<a href="">10:15</a> elon was saying statistics not predictions felix

stop obama

He did so many more edgy/heavy jokes on this, jeez

<a href="">0:19</a> Holy shit is that the streamer who beat Dark Souls on stream?

<a href="">8:36</a>Anyone else hear this

what am I hearing at <a href="">7:08</a>

felix: i just dont know why i get so many headlines for scandalsalso felix: strokes? ill drink to that

I live in Fairport and I cannot breathe

can you buy me an Ipad pro..

I’m here watching random pewdz vids cuz he’s on a break right now.

F

flF

you know,chinese people just can&#39;t help being over serious or producing bullshit in occasions like this, something is wrong with us, it&#39;s like,there&#39;s no way out

Lol : <a href="">4:06</a>Literally ten seconds later: <a href="">4:16</a>

When Pewds gets political: <a href="">12:52</a>

I like Matthew McConahay..
Hi

<a href="">00:55</a>Basically, the plot of Naruto Shippuden. I&#39;m not kidding.

f

Alexa just playes another persons audio

I love your tangents
<a href="">1:28</a>

f

It&#39;s not GTA 5 it&#39;s MAFIA III

Space isn’t real bro you can’t have a pressurized system next to a vacuum without a container

poor Jerma
Holy shit it&#39;s a compact streamer

Almost everything in the world is a Chinese product

Any video that starts with a Jerma clip is good in my book.

&quot;its like Amazon but for Chinese products basically&quot;<b>So, Amazon.</b>

Alchohol jokes just bcz he had a few sips GREAT

i dont think jack ma is trying to sound smart by saying all that... i think hes actually very intelligent except he cant put his words together right since english is not his language...... the mans trying his best

I feel like Elon copied apple when the glass broke, he had it weakened on purpose to get people to talk about it, like when Apple had the facial recognition that didn&#39;t work. Otherwise the truck would have just been a weird looking  electric truck.

We are closing in on a week after pewdiepie quit. I know it will take me years to watch all his videos that i havent watched, but he will still be missed.

&quot;the ability to speak dosent mean you are smart&quot;

A water balloon

Cant believe I subbed to u before u had a mil now u have 102 crazy

Saying that Alibaba is like the Chinese amazon is funny to hear when u know that 35% of their (amazons) stock is actually coming from china and re-selled alibaba/aliexpress products just with higher prices.

This went from You laugh You lose to let&#39;s talk about how boring and annoying this Chinese guy is 

I appreciate the way he laughed after saying I’m so glad I’m not poor considering how he kind of used to be

We just 9

F

Damn he is the maker of alibaba 

elon is a living legend

that first snitch dog had full on instagram brows

It too late now but I want to inform you we live in a society <a href="">9:40</a> - <a href="">9:55</a>

Those dogs are as*holes

JERMMMMAAA

Honestly whoever doesnt like the style of the Tesla truck is dumb because they obviously dont know lower graphics means higher speed

pewds is actually really smart eh

Nice kappa shirt douche

What’s the source of the vid at <a href="">00:18</a>

&quot;I upload every day&quot; <b>sad 19 year old noises</b>

go back to kFc jack ma!

Was confused for a moment there, though I was watching an upload by Jerma

Had no idea Jack Ma was that annoying.

McConaughey sounds like hes doing a bad Bill Clinton impression

Nonsense!
Hey pewds, are you ok? You started drinking again? I thought you stoped

PewDiePie: <b>exists calmly</b>Pewds: &quot;drinks a bit&quot;PewDiePie : &quot;So, let&#39;s talk about Elon&quot;

Jack ma just sucks

OMG THAT GUY WHO SAID OT WAS BECAUSE OF BARAC OBAMA THAT HAPPENED IN MY TOWN LMAO I FLUND THAT SO FUNNY

You’re not too bright you’re self pewds he said statistics not predictions dude, basic ass English.  And you’re making fun of other people’s intelligence? And how dare you compare him to Matthew! Lol jeez

Lonely Swedish man locked in bedroom drinks alcohol every time he laughs while looking at memes

Jerma isn’t short, he’s compact.
It is true, humans know more about space than they know about earth

<a href="">1:43</a> lol

This Chinese guy is a typical Chinese boomer XD

I like how Felix tells people to stfu because they&#39;re dumb, but he is probably the dumbest guy on youtube. People listen to him because he has a lot of subscribers

F

That tangent killed the vibe of the vid big time

that was mafia3

Your tangent sucked. Still luv u tho, bruh

Next ylyl do you laugh you take shit

<a href="">13:55</a>

Is Pewds balding?
<a href="">1:44</a> what dow fuark was that

i love to se pewdiepie drunk
“Im not interested in mars earth is more important”We need to search mars to see if we could possibly survive there when the world gets to bad to survive

God jack ma is a pompous prick

It freaks me the hell out when Pewds just gets serious and starts making some really good points. The guy is way smarter than he lets on sometimes.

Everyone calls me &quot;Epic&quot; on PSN and Twitch as my username is &quot;*****epicplayer&quot;. lol, so when he randomly says &quot;epic&quot; I feel it in my soul.

GTA 5 = Mafia 3

I LOVE JERMA! <a href="">0:20</a> watch “worst military game ever!” by him! it brought me to tears

Watched a documentary on jack ma - did u know lots of Chinese millionaires be mysteriously disappearing outta nowhere? jack Ma is the Chinese fav boi bc he keeps to the regimes dumb ass logic and doesn’t criticize that’s why he just talks a bunch of nonsense shit to keep people’s brains senseless and uncritical. He basically became what the regime made of him. I mean people becoming rich and capitalism is kinda the opposite of communism but hey... They literally feed the masses with dumbo entertainment to keep them busy from beim critical to the regime. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Elon musk is the best

clips r too quiet
This was the 69th ylyl

I found out he has a very low alcohol tolerance

I thought the thumbnail was him tasting a dripping pocket pus-

dont watch his on molly

Plz make more of these also, I love the post meme input

Alibaba is a company that supplies sellers like, when people buy 1000 cups and then sell them on amazon, it can also deliver to USA.

&quot;This is how Marzia feeds me&quot;I&#39;m dead  but I still have to drink

Judge: I&#39;m out Felix: <b>laughing intensifies</b> Me: ‍️
PewDiePie: &quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not poor&quot; Media: Write that down! Write that down!

jack ma is the real boomer

Elon should ban Alibaba shipments when he completed colonizing Mars.

My username in Roblox is johbac

Dude that clip with Elon and Asian ass hat is hilarious, why haven&#39;t I seen it until now.

I was drinking vitamin water while watching this 

I had a stroke I’m not offended just proud

NINCH

Will you be my dad

Ahaha I actually did this at the same time With hennessy I&#39;m 15 tho

God. I am so... sober by now

<a href="">4:50</a> holy hell is that Tyler 1

<a href="">14:43</a> this is how pewdiepie defeats coppa

How pewds defeat coppa:drinking &quot;slurp juice&quot; in a video

I could actually imagine Felix buying cats just to teach then the Halo theme song

Look at <a href="">1:45</a> in the corner

Look at <a href="">1:45</a>

McConaughey is one of those dumb people who think they&#39;re geniuses

FALUKORV

Jack ma(chinese dude):0.01% of human prediction is true because of accidentMaster Oogway(chinese turtle):there are no accidents

F for short guy

&quot;youtube demonetized me!&quot; internet:ahah
At <a href="">7:13</a> my man laughed so hard he spewed his drink all over the carpet

Pewdiepie hates people speaking gibberish because its bad bad that goes bad epic

F&#39;s in the chat for people that claim the China video is racist.Sorry you&#39;re brainwashed!

<a href="">7:56</a> wtf

not to be a mood killer but i feel like you got a lot of impressionable young kids who watch you i kinda feel iffy about this

I&#39;m 5.3 :(

Elon video. No. Stop. Get some help.

Damn that’s good that’s facts

*pops out the whiskeyhere we go again

He was sweating to bad you could see the reflection of his monitor on his forehead :D

Real cool Felix but he wasn&#39;t playing gta

Aww tiny guy is adorable!

When someone thinks Mafia 3 is GTA 5

F

5 feet was the human average

I love how Elon wants to die while talking to the Alibaba dude.

I just realized his shaker looks exactly like a pocket-pussy in the thumbnail O.o

I like how he&#39;s drinking but still says frick instead of fuck

5 minute crafts AND drinking? Sounds like Cody kolidgreszaszyjkasfhhsaafh
My Alexa started going ha haha haha behind me that’s the fastest I’ve ever ran

<a href="">0:42</a> F

<a href="">3:37</a> still dont drunk enough to lose control

f

RIP JUICE WRLD

Thank you for this, I’m really hydrated rn

I think that bathroom kid have very serious depression

<b>Haha</b>

I legit skipped the jack ma part

Jack Ma: &quot;I don&#39;t care about Mars, I care about Earth&quot;Also Jack Ma: *Doesn&#39;t donate to Teamtrees

Well that&#39;s not true at all. Yes, the Chinese guy has a problem with eloquence because of mediocre english skills and bad habit of making up numbers.But, he&#39;s point about perfecting yourself rather than being dependent on technology is true. Technology is covering up needle holes, while ignoring the main problem - human attitude towards ecology\another human\ animal etc. Elon-sama is false prophet. REPENT!

Laugh = drink Comment = like# = bracko Obama

Pewds sounds smart when he&#39;s drunk

Drank with you pewdiepie!!!

<a href="">3:57</a> she run out of breath

The stuff mcconaughey said made sense tho. “You gotta have dialogue to have a monologue” Talking with other people helps clarify the ideas and thoughts you have that may not have been fleshed out.

wtf pewds

I also thought the thumbnail meant he was drinking GFuel but I guess it was alcohol. What a troll move!

Jack Ma kinda sounds like one of those entitled billionaires I mean &quot;I&#39;d wait for an elevator if I was going to the Himalayas&quot;? Props to Elon for holding that conversation up.

The cats are photoshopped one of the cats tails are going through the edge of the walkway into the basement

It’s element not elevator. It’s ok tho. Still love you.

I remember when I was like twelve, pewdiepie just started and everyone thought his videos were too crass with language. Now some people say it’s kid friendly it shows how values have changed over the years

<a href="">2:17</a> my ears

Terraria men

OMG JERMA XD

yet yo

Wait is stealing plastic bags are legal or illegal

Felix: it&#39;s basically Lazada for chinese productsMe: what&#39;s the difference

Duuuuuuuuude, erma &lt;3
Gets banned in America

Jack Ma is really, <b>really</b> good at saying absolutely nothing for the longest period of time, in fact I think he belongs in Guinness Book of World Records

Is going to Mars based off of a statistic?

i can hardly hear the vid itself pewds is so loud

Augh

F
