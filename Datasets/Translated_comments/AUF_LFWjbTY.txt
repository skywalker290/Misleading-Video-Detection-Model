Terrorists Has No Religion Say No To Terrorism Allah Almighty Says:And you will surely find the nearest friend to those who have believed who said, “Indeed, we have helped this with And the closest in love and affection for the Muslims you will find those who say: 'Indeed, we are Nazarenes (Christians).' This is because among them are savants (i.e., scholars of Shariah) as well as monks (i.e., ascetic worshipers) and (moreover) they are not given to arrogance.

Surely These Extremists Are Not MuslimsListen To Dr Tahir Ul Qadri to Know About Islam it&#39;s Peace &amp; Love 

What evidence do we have that they are Muslim? Oh, none. RIght.

Looks like the mall in Milan.

DEATH TO ISLAM

deport to the east...
That&#39;s the kind of religious problems Trump tries to prevent...  These people want to forcibly introduce their Sharia laws into our culture and that causes these kind and far worse  problems.

stop being racist. its just their way of showing their happiness that we welcomed them

Enjoyed your video &lt;3 :D
They should be caught and then deported. Scum like this does not deserve to remain in a democratic country! But as usual Governments/Law Enforcements are &quot;Shiite Frit&quot;. Wish I only knew &quot;OF WHAT?&quot;And it is actions like this when people ignore the values and the respect for each other - regardless of religion; that certain groups start a religious persecution vigilante!!!!!

Fucking pigs. They can lick Allah ass

If they don&#39;t like Christmas they are free to go home. Don&#39;t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out - say good bye to freeloading off the dole.  <a href="">rashmanly.com</a>

What I am amazed by is that the majority of the people who commented on this video did not question it&#39;s authenticity. Rather, they blindly believed what the uploader had written.You could have asked yourselves simple questions like:1. The video isn&#39;t clear - so how do we know they are migrants or even muslim?2. There isn&#39;t any audio.Above all, most of you didn&#39;t bother to check the FACTS. Those of you that did (well done by the way) would have found that this was done by locals, not migrants/Muslims. Needless fighting is caused because of stuff like this, and can be avoided by checking the facts.

jeez

MOTHERFUCKING SCUMBAGS!!!!!!!

&quot;islamic&quot; [citation needed]

This is false.  You are perpetuating an incorrect story that is spewing lies and hatred.  (See comments below).  Please stop and get your facts before you post something so incredibly incorrect and stupid.  <a href="">

<a href="">

Shit&#39;s fake.Boom: <a href="">

It is unmistakably and undoubtably evident from this crystal clear 240p video of a 144p video they are indeed Muslim. Call Judge Dredd. Gas that shopping center. Nuke that continent. Throw shit let it stain! (Siz anladınız onu kafasına sıçtıklarım!)

They&#39;re not Muslim. they&#39;re a group, of teenagers participating in a tradition. People have said this for another video of a similar incident in Egypt but they also weren&#39;t Muslim. This is also not a Christmas tree but a Wishing Tree that is being vandalized.

This is titled &quot;Muslim immigrants destroy a Christmas tree&quot;... But it&#39;s false!The video shows a local &quot;baby gang&quot; (a gang of teenagers) in Galleria Umberto in Naples. They have been destroying the local Christmas tree every  year for the last few years, in their private war against the shop owners in  the Galleria who want to chase them away (as this gang use this place as a foot ball field, often causing damages to shops). It&#39;s a totally local problem, unrelated to immigrants or Muslims. Actually I find shameful that this video is shared to increase religious hate and intolerance.

poor engineers, doctors, children and women :( they did it because they had to leave their country because of war  : (.poor muslims. Come to Poland, we invite you

You ate good shit alhamdulillahYou ate good shit ake.
They are trying to portray Muslims as bogeymen, but if those big-hearted people there are watched carefully, they are trying to save a pine tree from the pot it is imprisoned in... Just kidding, what do the unstable people do? hahahaha
Naples. Christmas Tree Gallery, here we go again: gang tries to steal it, army thwarts theft | Videos and photosHere we go again. As happens every year, the Christmas tree in the Galleria Umberto I in Naples does not find peace. But, unlike previous times, this time it went wrong the gang of teenagers who regularly tries to bring home &#39;the Wishing Tree&#39;, to which residents and tourists rely their wishes by attaching a note.The band, made up of a dozen boys, hooded probably not to be identified by the surveillance cameras, went into action at one o&#39;clock last night. In less than five minutes they stripped the tree of lights and the star to make it lighter and can pull down more easily. Once the tree came down, the &#39;commando&#39; was going to drag it out of the tunnel where the use of two soldiers on duty in the vicinity has put to flight the young.In the past it happened many times that the tree was stolen only to be found in the neighboring Spanish Quarter where it is cut into pieces and used for the feast of St. Anthony Abbot, when it &#39;s the custom of lighting bonfires ( the so-called stones of St. Anthony). The tree - which is set up at the initiative of Antonio Barbaro, owner of several clothing stores in the gallery - was decked Monday, November 30. &quot;Unfortunately - says Barbaro - I find myself having to denounce once again the attempted theft. I&#39;m sorry &#39;cause that way you steal the wishes of Neapolitan children and the many tourists in the city these days. We will do it again and hope that the perpetrators of this stunt guys have the patience to wait Epiphany to get it. &quot;The tree in the Galleria Umberto has become a tradition. The first was set up in 1984. &quot;But at the time - remember the merchant - also he made an artistic crib and there was a security guard who failed the crib, today there &#39;anymore.&quot; The tree will be hauled up and put in place already in the day. But this time with a counter: it will be secured to a steel cable. On-site there is&#39; the municipal police.And it remains stunned to think that in such a gallery in the Neapolitan, in Milan, stands in all its glory a Christmas tree Swarovski. Is there, in the heart of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, 12 meters high and decorated with over 10 thousand ornaments, including more than 1,000 poinsettias, lighted by 36 thousand lights and decorated with silver ribbons. Enchants everyone, guarded and protected. Quite a difference.Monday, December 7, 2015, <a href="">12:34</a> - Last Updated: 12/07/2015 <a href="">22:13</a><a href="">

The crime scene is Italy, the perpetrators are so-called Muslim refugees, 90% of the commenters are atheist Turks...
May imamhatips be closed!

As a Muslim I am saying you can punish them whatever you want

Certainly a provocation. There is no sign whatsoever showing that they are Muslim. These people may well be a group of Islamophobs who did this in order to put the blame on Muslims. Please stop sharing provocative propaganda on youtube.

<a href=""> as u can see this is not  a migrant crime   nor this year news  ,   to all racist scumbags

SEE FIRST FROM 2015. Those who committed the incident are not Muslims. You attacked immediately, as always. The incident takes place in Naples, and the Neapolitans who committed the incident vandalize Christmas trees, try to steal them, and use them as firewood. This is an event that happens every year. If you have an Italian friend, go and ask. Before spewing hatred, I suggest you check how accurate the source is. How sure are you of your opinion just by looking at a video? <a href=""> href="">
At least they didn't rape the tree.
This makes me remember a certain scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey.

It's a lie! Don't keep saying 'Muslim'. The dwarves were angry with Santa Claus and tried to sabotage Christmas. But the incident was solved and Santa Claus accepted dwarf-sen's salary increase + sex service once a month.
damn muslims
Catch up or Mussolini
They attacked the poor tree as if they were engaging in a boss fight.
This is not real Islam...

In our holy book, the word of Allah, the Quran, the Lord says "my religion is for me, your religion is for you". He says: Do not attack Islam immediately, you haters. Such vagabonds have no religion, language or race. Probably the people who did this were consanguineous or something.
Then what are you doing in these guys' country?
Ag chomars
Today we are ashamed again on behalf of someone else
wtf? fanatics are always idiots. it doesn&#39;t matter islam, christians or jews or football teams. howewer, you can&#39;t blame religion. i have so many muslim friends and they are most friendly people in my life. i dont think the islam the evil. or jewish or any religion. stop the fanatics! not believers. ps: i&#39;m a Dell&#39;elmo di Scipio! :)

You can bet that they will be targeting religious artifacts very soon. In Italy, there are squares (piazzas) where, centuries ago, people were burned at the stake. Italy need to revive that practice for Muslims.

where in italy? when? i&#39;m italian, never i listen about it
