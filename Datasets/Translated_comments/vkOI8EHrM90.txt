Nailed it

His accent, style, attitude, and the way he delivered his flawless dialogs is too good, in fact he bought flavors to the villainous character

The people living in India do not value independence.
Amitabh Bachchan is famous in this country also
Super acting ever who is this brother major solid acting yaar
Major: I was with you for two days but I didn't understand you...Akshay: Iqbal Kadri?
There is acting class brother.
Understanding does not come to such an amazing actor...
One of the most brilliant adaptation of the real character. Amazing actor.

Very good movie Many NRI remember  this Jai Hind word when they were in troubled in foreign countries When all GOOD in foreign countries then  how much pollution in India  , so mucg dust heat .. How much traffic  etc ercIts hypocrisy of many NRI who disrespect  there own country  when they are safe in foreign  but when they are in troubled in other countries then they remember there own  mother nation the India. ( any ways  in world MOTHER  all things included. ))).Be always proud and respectful to your mother  nation country the India where ever you are ...

Superb acting

Amanullah is a brilliant actor

Who love this actor

Major's character is very awesome
His ACTING is very very REAL....

Mast acting yar major sahab
This actor is doing very good acting.
Today we have seen Akshay Kumar getting married on Facebook, we were not aware about it but we need to understand that Vaishno Devi does not need you and whatever work you are doing, Ritesh, you are not alone, you should have some decision about it. If it is helping then you don't have the courage to talk about this time while living in India.
Iraqi major was too good.He had a perfect Iraqi accent.He should more chance.

The one of the key persons behind the evaluation is Mr. Sunny Mathews, ( Toyota Sunny), a business man based on Kerala ( Malayali) . In this film Akshay Kumar played his role.

SUUUB BOOOOT!

The general is quitee excellent actor.

If you don't pass through our checkpoint then you will pass Mr. Ranjit, nice dialogue.
What an amazing Performance by Inaamulhaq sir ,such a brilliant actor

Amazing acting done inside.NSD types

Jolly llb 2 he did flow less acting

All of them earn illegal money. Actor director producer writer. Everyone is earning illegal money.
You bastard bitch, you have written a stupid story. Actually there is no unity among Muslims and hence they enjoy the unique benefits of being a writer, director, producer. The work of such people is to earn money by writing short films...
The American army killed innocent children and killed idiots. Sister, who wrote the story of this film or is he the son of Randy or is the most stupid speaking person in the world, that writer is that.
In this film all the hidden stories are shown. Dara Sallee, he never saw the real thing. In America, innocent children or orphans or MAZLOOMO or YATEMO are being bombed but they are being brought into Iraq.
Jhootee  kahanee hai . 200%

Wheres the Iraqi Major? All I see is a phudu  doing a poor poor job pretending to look Arab and talk in an Arab accent. This makes me want to vomit.   Dont disrespect  Iraq and Arabs this way.

<a href="">00:50</a> pehchana Iqbal Ansari
Very nice acting with unique way of dialogue delivery

Super action
The major of a country like Iraq was portrayed like a joker. The acting was very good but the personality did not match that of an Iraqi major.

Which song in ending????

Akshay Kumar sir you are the best hero in world

The way he has delivered the dialogue ossame

JK Wall puttiwala 
This actor (Iraqi Major) stole the show. I watched this movie many times just to see his acting skills. The scene where Akshay Kumar informs him that Saddam Hussein is coming personally elicits a genuine surprised and shocked response. It&#39;s a pity we do not see him in many movie these days...

Which song is that which is playing at the end of the clip?

Bhai is major ko dekh ke yaad aata hai..&quot;White cement wali JK wall putty is the best diwaaro pe papdi ka koi chance nai&quot;

Iraqis don&#39;t have these accents and they don&#39;t know Hindi this movie was way too exaggerated

What does the uniform have to do with the general's acting?
mst role played is adMi ne jo najora bana he
wow heartily moovy

love dis sccen

Iraqis don&#39;t look anything like those

my favorite movie. ... me us check point se nahi guzart to aap.....

hahaha ... ager is major ki jaga kapil ko rkh lata zyda behtar tha .. what a funny major.. sari trailor ki maaa ko da gya

best dialogue  this move

remarkable job
is this Iraqi accent

it&#39;s not a true story

Major look hindu indian not iraqi arab wat a bull crap do iraqi speak hindi or look like indian bullshit film

Airlift&#39;s director doesnt know that this is a Colonel&#39;s uniform not majors.

akshay kumar is the best actor in bollywood.......we love u akki.....u r our hero....our real hero.......... u r best and best actor in the world...........u r awsome.......... we really love u akki.....ur voice is like  action here.. u r no 1 akshay.....for that we love to say u akki.....

Nice movie

Iraq was and still is the most powerful country in the world
