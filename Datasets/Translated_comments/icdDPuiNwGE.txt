Holy shit I forgot about the COPPA

<a href="">13:45</a> :(

Leaving this comment to remind you that this video is 3 years old now. 

I like how &quot;misgendering&quot; (aka using biologically correct pronouns) is now considered a hate crime. The alphabet soup truly is bowed down to on a daily basis.

I have hope seeing you right now. Most amazing at your bestest. <a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/mSzlXqyICJbI1wLlxqPYBQ"></a>

I’m thinking about the kids who make videos and say “I wanna do Youtube for real!” While their family is barely paying to keep them alive and all of a sudden the FTC comes in and sues them a billion dollars and puts the family into more poverty.

Imagine meatcanyon getting flagged &quot;for kids&quot;

I miss the &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; Pewdiepie. 

Pewds is a magician, I am going to be 19 years old after 3 days.

holy shit theres like no new comments

Miss old YouTube when you can swear. Just like this world everything is becoming soft now

booooo dislike this video subscribe to morgzzzz!!!!!

&quot;dumbass anime avatar kids&quot; is the highlight of triggered users on any platform

Downfall of YT...

The dude who said they would sue personal channels is such a punk.

Then what about coco melon shouldn&#39;t they be cancelled then

75% of parents shouldn&#39;t be parents

AS A TRANS PERSON I REALIZE THAT PEWDS MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE. THOSE IDIOTS ON TWITTER ARE JUST THAT. IDIOTS. I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. if someone misgenders me i just say calmly &#39;i am female&#39; and thats it. i hate people like that and twitter is full of them &gt;:(

Of course anime profiles with thinking other people are evil.

Pewds haters are so pathetic and stupid.

cancelling people is not ok

i support me and you

<a href="">10:11</a> Team KonekoKitten
your app is so simple its boring but addicting

or just ban youtube for accounts under 13....................

Saw some of Morgz&#39;s old videos! They were so boring. However, some of his videos ARE amazing!

HA im a kid :/

I fucking love when pewds can say whatever he wants to!

Yay im 19 years old

Try check Morgz now

bruh I had YouTube when I was 4

Makes me mad when he still in shit on America

i like how he roast morgz for his content and YET i fucking love it thats life man

I miss pewnews
<a href="">3:50</a> the dude looks like if Todd Howard and Donald Trump had a baby

what is children&#39;s personal data????

Youtube: changes rulesYoutuber: make it family friendly?Youtube: well yes, but also no

Morgz viewers : nooooooMorgz haters: let&#39;s go get roasted morgz haha rekt noob .
I have always wanted to make YouTube vids about how my daily life goes (motocross, fishing, hunting, camping, etc.) if I did that would the fishing be for kids and the hunting be “graphic” and “not for kids”? YouTube needs to rethink their system because now from what I understand people with thousands of vids are at risk to be sued even though those vids might have been years ago??

Where’s the Morgz part of the video? 

Hi

I miss pewdiepie cursing vids
Feel like youtube is so heavily targetted cuz its crushing cable tv, news, etc

<a href="">10:11</a> konekokitten bois
At least morgz is better than you

OMG LOL <a href="">6:50</a>

Ok so...morgz is ugly (jk no bullying)

the person who sufferd the most from this is sml

im so glad he said something about dollightful. ive been watching her for a while and im a 20 year old man. i just think its fucking cool

<a href="">11:50</a> - You didn&#39;t say...

He&#39;s dead now
<a href="">13:04</a> thanks very cool

one word fortnite in america

<b>COMFIRMED</b> Felix lives in pewdsvill! At the bottom we could see it said “pew news” there are more too this than you might think..... Gamers I think we just discovered a new UNIVERSE PLOTHOLE

To make sure ur vid isn&#39;t made for kids just say f word in first second no problem i learned tht from the beam

14 year old: felix is a transphobeus: did you watch the video?14 year old: n- no but i- i- i heard some other p- people say it so it mus- must be true.

YouTuber makes a video about WWII but animated.YouTube: This is for Kids.

just wondering is cocomelon marked made for kids?

Who was here after Morgz left YT and turned back to his normal self?I need thousands of likes for this.

Im so glad that i grew up with old yt not this abomination of a problem :/

pew news intro looks legit
Powermove: Move YouTube HQ to Canada

He isn’t cancelled tho-

Morgz is leaving YouTube in 2021

<a href="">10:10</a>

<a href="">10:13</a> thats konekokitten

Isn&#39;t there literally a Youtube Kids app?

<a href="">10:11</a> koneko kittens meme

Lol so where cocomelon at now?

Me who&#39;s 12:

see since pewds famous he has people that have his back If I did this I would be cancelled without any subs like xD

Felix, he’s leaving YouTube

Y E S

Why am I watching this in 2021? Who knows ‍️

Lol now he stopped

When the Commenting is Disabled for videos that is made for kids is kinda annoying

I don&#39;t know if this also happens for PC but on mobile whenever you scroll down to look at the videos that you want to click on next there&#39;s like this little recommended bar at the top of it and you can click like related or from the person that you&#39;re watching currently and for some reason Shane Dawson popped up

god i miss you swearing fr, also you&#39;re so right i&#39;m so scared to speak on twitter cos anime twt cancels someone every two days

ban susan, and change her to pewdiepie

<a href="">10:14</a> is a good part with keneko kitten

Did anybody else think that when he said coppa at the end he said Popeyes? Also anybody from 2021?

BORGER

Right, at this point, Youtube isn&#39;t even protecting its own creators anymore, which is something they can do without anyone stopping them since they&#39;re a monopoly. <b>A new platform with Felix as the CEO needs to be set up so that YT actually has a competitor, watch everyone straight up abandon YT and hop on that instead.</b>

now belle delphine&#39;s channel is gonna be flagged for kids because she has videos with &quot;toys&quot;

Make a vid about russian Mr.beast A4 or I send you to Scp 3008 infinite ikea

<a href="">10:11</a> konekokitten
he says good evening, but I&#39;m watching in the morning

Pewdiepie has grey eyes

I find it funny that I&#39;m actually getting news from pewdiepie

pewdiepie he got new roll he is youtuber news

Me when I saw the title:  HOLY FUCKING SHIT I CAN DIE HAPPY

people just try to find a reason to be mad at people for the dumbest mistakes lol, just let them live like cmon people- he&#39;s human too-

coconut coconut co
I should just quit YouTube now

2021 like

Then what&#39;s the purpose of  youtube kids app

It’s always YouTube’s fault, you don’t get it PewDiePie It’s always
Yet YouTube still allows porn to be on here.

By that logic YouTube can sue the parents for ignoring policies

The ill-fated congo demographically peep because pound oddly pump across a lacking margaret. curious, worthless tachometer

Ladies and gentlemen, we got him

YouTube before: Don’t make edgy contentYouTube then: Don’t make child friendly contentYouTube now: DON’T MAKE CONTENT

I wish

I was watching a Nelk video and it said it was made for kids when I tried to switch to miniplayer lmfao

Plot twist: Felix becomes CEO of YouTube

I no 19 i 14 me go ooga booga not job work

Youtube: So we made an app for kids, that wont collect data. But we have a non kids app to make it so adults can enjoy stuff as well.Coppa: It looks like children are using your app, That is clearly YOUR fault. <b>sue</b>Youtube: So if I make a machine that see&#39;s if it&#39;s for kids, to punish them that will be fine?Coppa: Yes, but we will sue the content creators as well.Youtube: But it&#39;s not our fault for people letting kids roam freely on the internetCoppa: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I watch dollightful’s videos for the sculpting and painting, not because it is dolls

when koneko gets noticed by pewdiepie

Imagine someone makes one cent on YouTube and then gets flaged for kid content

YOU ROCK PEWDIEPIE

You can&#39;t swear but you can&#39;t not swear ok yt that makes sense

Roses are Red,Morgz is cursed,Whatever he did,MrBeast did it first.

When you are actually 19 years old lol

and I watched you since I was like 8

Bruh I just turned 13 today

Came here to see konekos tweet

this is one of the last of gloria borger before mary ham killed him

Sue cocomelon

M

yo

this is not epic

I loved pew news

You aren&#39;t allowed to say the word &#39;fun&#39; because it constitutes as childish language.I feel like that sums up the situation very well.

why is fun on the list??

His views per video are so low lol

Mr beast: <b>farts</b>Morgz: ```WRITE THAT DOWN```

there&#39;s nothing more entertaining than angry pewds

mate every single person has youtube. For sure 10 mil 12 years old are whatching this

Why do ppl bitch about collecting data? I see nothing wrong with it

<a href="">13:36</a> preach

Finnaly

<a href="">10:12</a> concrete pog
POPPY SMORIA  HAHAHAHAH hahahhah BJASHAGHAUJDAHAHHHAHAHAHHAH
pews: I can&#39;t think of any 12 year olds watch morgzme: thinking of that one kid in the back of class on his phone watching you know what

Wait... they send ads based on age? so THATS why I  keep getting body wash ads. Its because I&#39;m a teen...

Finally

<a href="">6:00</a> i f%@*ng love this

man this is my favorite news channel!, much better than CNN. LOVE YOU MARY HAM!!!!!!

i miss pew news....
so, about the transgender thing, isnt that video like, pretty fckin old no? these twitter ppl really have nothing to do....

Celebration.

I watch pewdiepie since I was young age (13/14) and damn he used to swear a lot, and I grow with it...

Boga

I wanna see bbc intro like tha

The video that changed everything

I miss Poppy Smoria

If they delete pewds channel ww3 will start

<a href="">10:08</a> If you are Koneko fans.

Pewdiepie: I don’t curse in my videosAlso him: I don’t say fuck just to loose ad revinue

<a href="">6:12</a> I watch that channel and I’m 15

Mrbeast: Exists.                                                              Morgz:QUICK COPY THAT DOWN IDIOTS

Konekokitten epic
So this is why we&#39;re 19-year-olds now

P

Instead of bug uh o whut about pewd ga ho

Im 9

The 1st actual series video

Imagine tweeting Pewds that hes a transphobe when he didn&#39;t mean to call that female a &quot;he&quot;...are you stupid? even I as a kid wouldn&#39;t do that...

It feels so nostalgic hearing him swear

How to watch all content when you are not a kid just lie about your age stupid

Not even 2020 likes morgz
yesssss connected <a href="">10:10</a>
also felex

youtube is dumb

In 2018 I think me and my bff uploaded on my sisters channel, im surprised the didn&#39;t terminate our channel.

My problem is that my videos aren’t really meant for anyone it’s not really meant for kids but kids could watch it I just dont want it on YouTube kids

I wish

The thumbnail be like ‍
thank you pewdiepie i am 19 now

<a href="">9:30</a> smol brain u just did it

YouTube is for everyone. People watch what they watch. You can&#39;t get up YouTube channels that seem 18+ but kids watch them. People watch what they want. Click on what they want to.

all i gotta say is go felix. Like the dislikes are from all of morgz accounts.

I’d be a better new anchor

What about coco melon

I miss pew news
KONKENEKO GOT NOTIKESCSES

When I try to watch some family vlog channel I immediately get recommended all nursery rhymes its so annoying

What it do flight crew, fts, flight team stand up

When I saw thisPewDiePie: <a href="">11:02</a>Me: Hell No HELL NO HELL NOOOO NO I WANT TO NE THE SAME AGE

make more pew news

ha sucks to be those anime avatar kids

This is a very good video for content creators I think we should get this to YouTube

Let’s gets to YouTube

Papa Gloria is not dead!!!

Morgz Is not in MrBeast YouTube Rewind 2020Serves him right

Your our forever king 
best  thing Kids can still use  their mom&#39;s or dad&#39;s account to watch content for 13 plus

Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Stage 1 cancel: completeStage 2 terminate: N/A
Even when I was at the age of 10, I wouldnt watch the channels you specified

<a href="">10:08</a>

Government and their policies Killed YouTube man

killcell morgs

<a href="">0:10</a> thats a nice picture

I wonder if someone will just get fed up with the dumpster fire that YouTube has become and will make a new video platform

-youtube get fined for collecting children&#39;s personal information off the internet which is solely their choice and doing -the FTC: CONTENT CREATORS ARE THE PROBLEM

boxing

SUB to me if you love PewDiePie....

This video was epic cause it was pretty badass for pewds to curse

AYE KONEKO KITTEN MADE IT IN!!!

Pz9 12up pfft you mean 7and under

People get so sensitive over gay or trans people instead of taking their time to understand.

Bruh I&#39;m 12 and I make videos YouTube can&#39;t do s**t

I kinda forgot about COPPA since COVID

Title: Morgz is cancelledMe: visible confusion

“You know, I actually support LGBT.”<b>everyone liked that</b>

<from>brazil</del>
That part at the end of the video where pewds tells his haters to go fuck themselvesThat made me very happy

e

My first pew die pie video
Why don&#39;t they just........age restrict it?Don&#39;t take the revenue, they need it, so just age restrict the videoThe FTC is the most sensitive group of Karens that I&#39;ve ever-

I just had a t-series ad in this video....

Has this been fixed?

morgz is canceled, it got me

You are right morgz got cancelled

Logan Paul talks like he doesn’t have a tongue

what will the 9 Y.O&#39;s do now?

she needs braces

Im 5 years old and coppa isnt gonna stop me from watching youtubers that swear

Who else came here from Koneko?

this is how pewds lose 2% of his subscribers

It&#39;s the anniversery of htis video

Poppy smoria:&quot;My Minecraft videos&quot;Me: Hold up

&quot; If you make video&#39;s for Youtube..,&quot; then i heard nothing else because i focused entirely on how fucked up her teeth overlap.

Felix: trying to explain what was happening and how he is not a transphobealso felix: puts hoes mad at the bottom of the screen lmao

Who watch this in 2020 or 2021 happy new year stay safe guys 

Adults cannot determine what is for kids because they are not kids

<a href="">5:06</a> yup but people still swear as if swearing is normal .

Pewdiepie the online politist

btw im 10 and have real youtube lol

Americans really need to take responsibility for their own actions  I&#39;m American and my kid LOVES YouTube but he has the <b>kids</b> app. But theres some messed up stuff that&#39;s &quot;kids&quot; videos on here. YouTube should be watching those channels trying to be considered kids vids when they&#39;re really not and leave everyone else alone 

Hi

pewds: &quot;Go f*ck yourself&quot;YouTube: well who knows how many years ago you said 9 year old army sooo <b>ban</b>

iam i a kidor a 13teen year old

I don’t know about you guys but kids younger that 13 the MAJORITY don’t wanna watch peppa pig or children’s thing

I like how the font for &quot;pew  news&quot; is the same as CNN. and CNN is as fake as new gets, so he is secretly telling us that whatever he is saying is a lie.

it has been a yearsince we have pew news

<a href="">10:11</a> 
at this current moment the government could sue pewds for 177492000 usd

he didn&#39;t even talked about  morgz getting cancel

im 7 f*** COPPA
<a href="">10:10</a>

YES but no

This is actually very educational 

Is tis real or fake

I’m 12 sooooooo like how does this apply to me because I’m close to 13 but I’m not

YouTube creator: this game is so       f@&amp;?ing fun!!!YouTube: HE SAID FUN!!! 90% of revenue please, you are CLEARLY a children’s channel

Me: Thinking I am 13 Me: Realizing I am 11Me: 2 more years for god sakeBruh so u cant cuss for kids but COPPA says u have to cuss? lol? Its humanity is really weird.. I understand everything its just I dont want to type anything on this small phone. YouTube is dying It will either get cancelled or by no adds, banned, and loss of too much cash plus youtubers wont make anymore cash..

<b>monster school</b>
M O R G Z
In 2049:  <b>YouTube is cancelled</b>

I like how every age you think of when it has to do with your viewers is 19

Kid: changing age 26 YouTube:
Anamation youtubers they like to swear lime arcadecloud and smashbits

I come from the future Poppy Smoria killed Pewdiepie

I&#39;ve always wondered why PewDiePie was often called a transphobe... Now that I&#39;ve seen this video... I wonder how stupid can people be?I mean I know you should be more careful but can someone not even accidentally misgender someone ever in their life without being a transphobe?!

Yep

Click bate yes

So why is this a youtube/youtubers problem and not a parents problem?This is why parenting in the US is total garbage.

Im 13yo but now im 9yo

Another example of American Laws that everyone has to follow because our governments are too scared to say no to America!

OOoooOo he swer 2s

Hi I just subscribed

i got a pewdiepie ad and thought it was the video

If youtubers can&#39;t swear in their video&#39;s then why do they allow nsfw video&#39;s that are not for kids and are still not removed...

Lol this guy is so funny XD

Morgz wants to box u plss Have a fight with him0

The ad was pewdiepieThe video was pewdiepiePewdiepie had a mask on in the adThe video was made before COVID-19Which confused meNow I’m good

Cocomelon should be flagged as kid channel. Means 60 - 90 %revenue gone

<a href="">10:10</a> That is from Konekokitten, a YouTube who recently reached 1 mil subs.

the biggest youtuber exposing someone so great to see it

<a href="">10:50</a> guys we’re finally 19 :D

barely anyone is talking about how koneko kitten&#39;s Roblox meme is in this video.

Mr.Beast: breathesMorgz: uploads video &quot;breathing for 24 hours straight  (gone wrong) <b>called ambulance</b> prank&quot;

The most satisfying &quot;go f yourself&quot; on YouTube, knowing the deal he&#39;s been through.

Anime avatar kids = plane of screaming toddlers

<a href="">10:10</a>

<a href="">10:57</a> the moment we became 19 year olds

Lmao I&#39;ve been watching YouTube since I was 7 lol

Pewds: i like this tweetKoneko: omg omg omg guys pewds respekt my roblox meme

Imeayodoneveknoalanpeopzokilyo

Pew stop acting like people follow this stuff

Lame... If you want to go higher make it 10 then lol. You can&#39;t jump from 9 to 19 so freaking fast wtf.... Dont be a sheep pew

so you know that “new anime plot” video? well i went on it recently and couldn’t make comments bc youtube somehow decided that it was for kids.let that shit sink in

Fun fact: the moon is getting closer to earth every year is half an inch

<a href="">10:11</a> koneko

i love this tweet

I like the description, it&#39;s simple and epic

konekokitten
The ftc is Fricking bshit

Youtube be like 
What about cocomelon

imagine growing up watching youtube kids instead of regular youtube

God sometimes I’m ashamed to be called an American.

Get rid of cocomelon

<b>watches pew news</b>
In my channel, I have made 2 videos and they&#39;re FPS (First Person Shooter) game, but it is on Roblox. Does this mean that it is &quot;Made for kids&quot; (because of Roblox) or &quot;Not for kids&quot; (because of FPS)? Also if YOU mark the vid as &quot;Made for kids&quot; then you can&#39;t use YT editor (I have no space on PC so I use it) so I have to use &quot;Not for kids&quot; but if YT puts it as &quot;Made for kids&quot; then I&#39;ll get sued, but I don&#39;t have £45,000 in my bank, does this mean that as a 13-year old I&#39;ll be in debt?SOMEONE HELP!!!!!

I have been watching youtube as a kid but I didn&#39;t give crap to my privacy and now feel like ididot

Now pewds can atleast say his words...............for money..........

The day we all turned 19 yr old

I’m gonna say it: <b>youtube sure isn’t what it used to be</b>

Ad: express VPN will stop you from hackersMe: google is my hacker

over the age of 12? dude my lil bro is 8 and he fucking hate morgz he reported every one of his video

I like how the pew news editing crew tried to make morgz mum look funny but made her look basically the same

Your thumbnail artsiest needs a raise

...

lol koneko

Pewdiepie watched Jaiden Animations at <a href="">9:53</a> at bottom right

BOGA BOGA BOGA OOOO BOGA OOOO BOGA BOGA OOO

<a href="">0:01</a>

So kids watching content on Youtube &quot;KIDS&quot; is unacceptable and punishable, but 13 year olds visiting PornHub and similar sites is completely fine? WHAT THE FUCK?! WOW!

Just joined the 19 year old army today

Morgz doesn&#39;t make videos with friends because he doesn&#39;t have any

Does that mean if Rick and Morty was on YouTube you’ll get demonetized because it was “made for kids” since it was an animation?That’s stupid

Who else is watching this while pewds is doing the coco melon thing 

Youtube be like: Youre not allowed to make edgy content. Youre not allowed to make family friendly content as well

Youtube is forcing pewds to change... I dont like that

Hey

with more &quot;edgy&quot; content we wouldn&#39;t have that many snowflakes in the world, right? or am i just being a fuckin moron?

Pewdiepie: i cant see anyone older than 12 watching morgzMe: i cant see anyone older than 7 watching morgz

MY KING KONEKO <a href="">10:10</a>
I miss pew news
I went from 13 to 19 real fast lol

So satisfying to hear him say &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; to his haters. Wish I had that kinda savagery.

me: <b>*sees COPPA*</b>Me, Dream viewer: <b>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</b>
This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if parents would monitor the content their kids get into online

YouTube in 2021: so guys you’re not allowed to post content anymore

It&#39;s PEWDIEPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I&#39;m in the teen section. I can&#39;t wach vids that are age restricted but I&#39;m old enough for Google to collect my data.

Meanwhile,  some Indian/other  &#39;epic roasters&#39; and streamers using full on swears in another language XD

6.4 mill views in 8 mins. Damn

Please swear again

I understood nothing 

Ghsnavjsndbvdhakmdvgsajjdbbwkakme
Youtube refuses to manually review anything and it really really really sucks. I think they need to stop being greedy for money and pay people to look at things rather than their stupid algorithms.

Morgz got more dislikes than likes......

You have to be 13 to have an account on YouTube, but you can just use it logged out, which means you can watch videos but you can’t save, like or comment on them (or you could just lie about your age unless your parents made your google account)

Who is Morgz? I hear him in MrBeast vids but I don&#39;t actually know who he is

Youtube 2005 - 2015: real, amazing quality videos people worked hard onYoutube 2016 - 2020: I BOUGHT THE MOON MUST WATCH OR A SPIDER WILL BE IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHTReal video: hey guys, make sure to buy my merch and subscribe ok bye. Also look we made a tinfoil version of the moon.

Does anyone else find their targeted ads really weird and nothing to do with you? Like if they showed me aps for cat toys i would be bankrupt however...I get philomatch...it&#39;s not even my countryyyy

Finally pewds can Swear again  I miss the old Pewds

Poopdiepie news
Hentai is animation to

i did not see chad wild clay coming into this video

Yes he finally got cancelled

Soooooo i have a question if you dont make money from youtube Can you get the whatever this Guy said <a href="">3:28</a> ( penalties ?!?!?)I just got scared cuz ..like do you need to pay or wtf ....ik im Dumb but i dont get it 

2050: MrBeast title: I bought the sun.                              Mr Beast buys the sun.                                       2051:Morgz title: I bought SATURN (regret it).              Morgz: buys a science fair project on Saturn

Lol imagine if they sue a content creator who is 13 xD

Why would you get sued for making kids content? It makes no sense.

Then: Borger OUGH Now: FLOOR GANG OUUGHH

PewDiePie you&#39;re not allowed to roast trash cause its gloBaL warMing

Respect

Go to morgz channel he has 666 vids

Binod.

Zgrom have to be cancelled

I agree, it is not fair. Its the kids not the creators.

finally

Okay

Hmm.......I think ive heard of the 9 year old army

This video has nothing to do with morgz but I still love pew news

I hate Morgz
the no. of likes in this comment is the number of children who have fake ids to watch youtube

When our age jumps from nine year olds to nineteen year olds:<i>Parkour!</i>edit: yes i know this was months ago

I was here from Konekokitten

Rip

Then how coco melon exists ???

The origin of the the nineteen year olds

What about mrbeast

Ah, Koneko&#39;s tweet.

Wait I wanted you to cancel morgz stupid clickbait

I dont like the new youtube coppa thing

Conclusion: <b>Kids ruin everything.</b> Adopt puppies and kittens instead.

So if someone would post hentai it would be claimed as for kids because its a cartoon?

9years army is illegal

Coco melon sucks
Pewdiepie is right that it’s never the parents fault u know why beacause they are too scared to be called the worst parents ever all the parents that don’t understand to use the YouTube kids version app are the worst parents ever beacause the content creators are being harmed cause of this

<a href="">3:40</a> Felix: what do i doAlso felix:say bitch plenny times in bitch lasagna video

Jake: 8-16 year olds<b>uploaded a videos featuring a Pr0nstar</b>

<b>I smell koneko kitten</b>

PewDiePie keep up the good work

I wish

in ten...
Youtube: you need to be family friendly but also swear and there&#39;s a 90% chance that your video will be demonitised or you will be sued

YouTube Kids is not for under 13&#39;s. Do you really think a 12-year-old is going to watch Cocomelon or Kids Story Time?? I thin the parents should control the videos their children watch. YouTube Kids is not for kids.

psyche
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat

konekokitten: OMG OMG OMG PEWDIEPIE APPROVED MY MEME LETS DO A VIDEO!!!!pewdiepie reaction: congrats YOU ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL
Youtube is so stupid that YouTube thinks my content is family friendly , but I play 12+ games smh.

So if PewDiePie does a video on mental health and says, “ if you are struggling, please, don’t be afraid to ask your parents for help”, would that be flagged for being for kids and not get recommended as much because he said, ask you parents?

sister comes and punches mealso sister:IT WAS HIS FAULT

Pewdiepee is cancelled

PewDiePie is the worst YouTuber ever you should quit YouTube PewDiePie

PewDiePie is the worst YouTuber ever you should quit YouTube PewDiePie

EYYYY KONEKO WAS IN PEW NEWS.
Wait... I wanted to do animation but this kinda threw me off. Well done YouTube. Hope you&#39;re proud of yourself.

YouTube made me lie about my age for nothing

i thought it was donald trump

How the F ‘T series’ gets 140MIL subs than PEWDIEPIE?!

Bye the way I make gacha life stuff on tic tock my name is WOLF Friend

Pewdiepie I dont like Morgan because he copying people

poppy smoria

Good on Felix for admitting he was wrong, while also not rolling over for the mob-mentality. I can&#39;t speak for the whole trans community, but I&#39;m pretty sure most people forgive you (for what that&#39;s worth)

I’m close to 13

is theoddonesout made for kids??

youtube:dont be edgyalso youtube:dont be family friendlyYOUTUBE HAS NO MORE VIDS

MORGAN PLaY  for mincraft

Mogz more like mogs
:/

Keneko we see you

ftc diss track (question mark)

*kids playing on the middle of busy roadParents: it&#39;s ok kids, have fun*kids get hit by  vehiclesCOPPA: I&#39;M GONNA SUE THE ROAD AND VEHICLES OWNER

Koneko kittens meme was on there

if youtube thinks animations/cartoons are for kids, hentai be quacking

HE SWORE!!part of me is happy and the other part is sad

Is YouTube picky?

React on the newest disstrack pls it will be very funny

What if Morgz is pretending to be a bad youtube channel just to help give pewdiepie a content..?

Delete your YouTube channel pudepie
<a href="">10:11</a> its kenokokittens tweet !!!! kenokokitten is a roblox youtuber

Woah it&#39;s konekokitten
youtube be like: ok well for kids is good cuz we hate bad words and edgy contentalso youtube: ok well if you good and for kids we are gonna take your money becuse we got fined even though yor doing nothing wrong

YouTube is clearly not doing a good job on this. For example, Cocomelon which Happens to be the biggest source for little childrens content on the YouTube website, is almost virtually dominating the platform.

PewDiePie: Your all nineteen year olds!Me: I&#39;m nineteen time to go to college no get ice cream!Also me: Wait I should be responsible and be healthy!Healthy me: I won&#39;t get ice cream I&#39;ll get a McDonald&#39;s McFlurry! Note: Sorry if I spelled something wrong I can&#39;t be a true nineteen year old. 
THANK U

Konekokitten
That 4.3k dislikes are morgz fans

<b>Anyone still watching PewDiePie during quarantine? Just me?</b>

Felix: i don&#39;t want my videos to be claimed as kids videos also Felix: puts a pewdiepie version of cocomelon as his intro

Anyone else going to notice that PewDiePie&#39;s face sometimes acts like a greenscreen on the sides?

<a href="">6:00</a> we have reached the peak of cringe.

Daayum love u ... and also u uploaded this video on my bday lol

When he said fuck it actually threw me back lmao

Get a bunch of kids to watch t series most edgy video

This was clickbait because it said morgz I cancelled when he didn&#39;t even talk about him

Just be like Facebook and don&#39;t let a kid under 13 login. Seriously YouTube. It&#39;s so simple. What was the point of making YT kids

Some kids are so clever that they put a random birthdate. That&#39;s what I used to do when I was a kid

PewDiePie stop making videos about morgz
Keneko got mentioned ayyy

Youtube is done little upsie

Omg bloody jangbricks

But Facebook is still a thing

Coppa = mega Karen
ShOo awaY YoUTuBe I aM a 7 yeAr OlD

Pewdiepie: SwearsMe: Immediately subscribes.

YouTube: You must be 13+ to get an accountEveryone 12- : <b>says they were born in 1912</b>YouTube:Everyone 12-: Sometimes even my genius surprises me

<a href="">6:03</a> I’m sorry pewds did you mean the age of 6

I can see that Popy Smoria is very confused about the whole coppa thing that randomly appeared out of no where

the youtube kids is for kids but i mean 3 year olds.

YouTube is evolving, just backward

Pewdiepie: They use targeted ads<b>Me getting a Lingering ad</b>

<a href="">10:14</a> ayy konekokitten is in this

I&#39;m all for rights and transgender rights, anyone who knows me knows that. But this is ridiculous. People expect people to know their gender based off looks? When it is so clearly not the case anymore; you can&#39;t do that. If you want to be called a different pronoun, it&#39;s up to you, not the other person. Stop this ridiculous bullshit. I&#39;m as left as they get and even I find this absolutely ridiculous.

Ur cancelled pewdiepie bot
I clicked this video because u r pewdiepie

<a href="">10:08</a>

Making it really PC. Sad

Really pewds? Morgz was not mentioned once in this vid

<a href="">3:27</a> pissed this guy offf

Morgz copy Mrbeast
Bruh I&#39;m 12 year old

i wanted to see what this whole thing about youtube kids was so i logged on (im 12 btw) and literally NOTHING was intresting like what 12 year old would wanna watch &#39;&#39;baby sings johny johny&#39;&#39; like wtf and then i couldnt even get off it so i was stuck without watching the normal youtube for like a week

Tell your fans the truth your subscribers are  payd

Stoop pewdie pie
Koneko&#39;s meme is in this vid

<a href="">10:01</a>

This video is making me scared to upload videos!

morgz has the same remote as me. Im disgusted.

I AGREE WITH PEWDS.

The famous YouTuber means you just cannot be so mean if you are famous and roast a YouTuber you will permanently be banned from YouTube

Do they realize how long animation takes It takes a day to make 30 seconds of an animation and they are getting there money cut That’s a lot of effort wasted

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Finally

KENEKOKITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

new york state go that money beceses i think mose education is on google product which tey may have found out was colestinng studends data, I think, dont quore me on this and i cant spell

giving me some serious trevor noah vibes lolz

My account age is like ~90 years old

I&#39;m here coz koneko kitten is cool

2007: imagine making money doing youtube2020: imagine making money doing youtube
Ok who actually is over 10 and watches youtube kids it&#39;s legit made for 3 year olds YouTube should make YouTube kids stuff that 10-13 yrs old would like and make  an app called something like YouTube younglings like if u agree

Swearing in a non-family friendly video: UNACCEPTABLEMaking children’s content: UNACCEPTABLE

don&#39;t worry coppa is dumb robot chicken is for kids

Morgz is not canceled son and he ain&#39;t gonna be bruh i dont care anyone    can hate me  i aint care morgz forever i ain&#39;t subscribed to this do bur because it is what it is

I can assure you 16 year olds are not watching Jake Paul

I’m here from Koneko if your not like

Pewdiepie looks and sounds mad in this video

Youtube’s ads are personalized? Then why am I getting ads for window installation? Checkmate Atheists

Most reliable news source
So what happened with morgz??

Woah koneko kittien wad there

im 13 and my videos get flagged because im young

wow pewdiepie noticed kitten praise him

Pewpie leave morgz alone

Wait (I know I’m late)... I didn’t see any of that drama, but it’s weird that ppl got mad over Pewds saying “he” instead of “she” bc if you watch Pewdiepie he literally does it ALL of the time. It’s innocent. His first language isn’t English, and usually people will mix those two words up. All of my friends are bilingual, with English as their second language, and they do it on a daily basis... people gotta chill.

how tf is jake paul’s content made for 8 year olds

He is the best youtuber

Stop making fun of morgz I like him

yass queen
I think the reason why a lot of kids don’t watch <b>YouTube Kids</b> is because literally almost all the videos are made for people who are 6. Whenever I see my brother watching YouTube Kids, all I see is either Ryan’s Toy Review or somebody roleplaying with LEGO characters.That’s just my perspective though.

This, this is where it all began, with coppa

Literaly its not like kids heard cuss words

Poppy smorlya is pewdiepie

I’m hating the Coppa I’m 15 and I like to watch gaming and art.

If you unbox toys and you swear on that video what will happen

Okey or yes or something

Now there is no way to get monetized lol

That intro... it sounds like the floor gang anthem...

Thats Right

When ur name is Morgan but u don’t like morgz  .-.

I used to watch Morgz and i would always think to myself.....Why tf is this guy so loud and annoying?! lol

look at terminal montage&#39;s coppa vid

Are you watching this in quarantine?

“borga ouh” sounds like “floor gang ouh”. This is stage one of the evolution

<a href="">2:46</a>

everybody gangsta till he says the f word uncensored TWICE

Ftc flight team stand up

You tube tekashi 69 ratting everyone out
sue Kappa too!
Pewds : he said who is audience is, we got he !Also Pewds : buy the merch, fellow 9 years olds

Okay so south park is &quot;for kids&quot;

You don&#39;t wanna know what shit I watch

Pidipie

Welp time to move to pornhub

Ryan toy review’s is going to get his dad to say f**k every five minutes

<a href="">10:11</a> Konekokitten :D
KonekoKittenYT?
<a href="">13:36</a> music to my ears

this video couldnt be more true about how shit youtube is at looking after thier own website, probably just one guy programming a whole bunch of &quot;google owned androids&quot; that doo all the work

Good news channel

The YouTube kids app is really for babies no joke it’s just preschool songs

<a href="">13:20</a> - “the ability to speak does not make you intelligent”

How do we protect the kids on YouTube?I know, stop giving the adult youtubers a that did nothing wrong money for making creative mature content.

anybody gonna talk that kenko is there?

I’m pretty sure sis vs bro got the made for kids flag

idc about this i made this acc a few days ago i am nine years old but i set my birthday in 2000 bruh

<a href="">10:10</a>

Yes YouTube had a policy where they did not allow kids to access YouTube. The geniuses at YouTube, however, fucking shot themselves in the foot by promoting themselves as a platform for kids because, clearly, kids make up a big chunk of the audience and have much more time on their hands to watch all day.  So COPPA waited for some time, gathering evidence, before they decided it was sufficient to sue the platform, bypassing YouTube&#39;s initial arguement. Smh

I stopped making videos because of this

Youtube forgot that they DO have a place for the kids to watch safelyand if you do want to be safe on this version of YT is to turn on Incognito and the place for the kids to watch safely is using YT kids so they did not have to do this, so YT needs to say sorry for this reason:Reason: MisunderStoodand they did it for no reason, last but not least did YT make YT Kids? or google made it, they litterally misunderstood, and they made that app for no reason, can the kids go and google &quot;Is Incognito safe?&quot; Youtube please read this ok you misunderstood, and if COPPA is seeing this you need to answer this.

ahh the old days pew newsss ahh

<a href="">11:50</a> WTF

Why cause you uck

When this is in the recommendations.

KONEKO

Pew changed the world

Pewdie news
The moment the 9 year olds became 19 year olds

Pewdiepae is flawer of mi life..stay connacter..yes big like n subsraib 

<a href="">13:36</a> I love how he just completely, without hesitation, says &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; all the anime avatar kids...

Believe or not, 12 year olds are not 2 year olds.

youtube&#39;s logic: South park is an animation so it&#39;s made for kids, obviously

yes

excuse me I do not think you are a transphobe at all and would never assume the worst so pls don&#39;t target my people

<a href="">10:10</a> is konekos tweet if you&#39;re coming for that

KONEKO KITTEN EEEEEEEEEEEE

YouTube: wait that&#39;s illegal.Erin:wait, that&#39;s not vegan..

kitten is a youtuber

To win on YouTube now you have to be vanilla boring totally inoffensive. Unless you&#39;re pewdiepie and you have big clout

<a href="">3:00</a> dang is that a giraffe

<a href="">10:12</a>

That man will get hate for the rest of his life love it!

Me finally able to get out of school at 19

who came for konekokitten

Thank god covid-19 stopped YouTube before they made everything even more terrible

It is kinda dumb if you see YouTube kids it is clearly targeted at 4 to 8 year olds not 12 year olds like it is crazy they expect them to watch that

Bojack Horseman clips were labelled for kids.

Don’t mind me I’m just looking for morgz fans here.

Well now he&#39;s a floor gang

Freedom of speech is unavailable in YouTube

Poppy Smoria is not floor gang!

Anybody who came from Koneko kittens vid he&#39;s at <a href="">10:10</a>

im 13
Are lord agrees
Remember when people were so worried about coppa

Barnabydixon: creates adult puppet content with alcohol,drugs and more.COPA: TOy cHAnel!!

When you&#39;re under the age of 13I&#39;m gonna pretend I didn&#39;t see that

Who is watching in quarintine

Trying to find the Dr Phil vid but can&#39;t.

Worst YouTuber ever
Who else was reminded of the leam neson meme by the ftc guy also it&#39;s a catch 22

All this would&#39;ve been avoided if Google wouldn&#39;t sneak on us with those ads... Seriously? ads based on personal data?Just ask me what kinda ads i want, i swear I&#39;ve reported tons of ads as either inappropriate or repetitive, but they always appear again.. Google is a Joke!

I wish morgz was cancelled pewdiepie your a god

I&#39;m 13 and i think gayrgz and Fake Paul are some cringy asses

Best news channel

But why does it matter if children have a YouTube channel they just want a YouTube channel I know you&#39;re so worried about the privacy but it wouldn&#39;t be any different if their mom had an account especially if they posted videos of their kids on their account so they don&#39;t want to be any different

I hate morgs
I&#39;m proud to be 9 years old and I&#39;m watching pewdiepie

Bakit Mo mag translate ito

You’re a youtubephobe, jerk 
Morgz is cancelled <b>crab rave starts playing</b>

Agreed

Pewdiepie know iam fan but you can&#39;t be too rude

A small percent that’s here from konekokitten?

<a href="">13:35</a> good one

But... movie theaters put ads before R rated movies? Why is it fine to play a McDonalds ad before a R rated film, but not with a video with one swear word in it?

There isn&#39;t anything wrong with Morgz!

pervert

pervertpervertpervertpervertpervert

the system is shit seeing as videos like stunna 4 Vegas wet and dababy jump audio being for kids

wow kenoko is there lol

i liked how konkeokitten was in here it really made a good point with him he doesnt directly put his content for kids but more big brain kid dude ppl

If you dress femininely, don&#39;t expect people to assume you a male.If you have long hair and wore thick makeup, don&#39;t expect us to not assume u r a female

MIRGZ SUCMS

Do u watch konokitten

even then why is this a rule anyway wouldn&#39;t parents help them make an account to youtbue? i mean come on.... they should made this 13 years or older site to begin with....   instead of this ridiculous shit.   Content creators should blame children... no we shouldn&#39;t blame children we should blame the parents of irresponsible behavior...   I mean who cares anyway what they watch... most children play call of duty...  18+ mature game violance... and here we all are content creators (if you play a game with violence where is always a child playing the game...)coppa law should sue developers instead of companies...

Idiot do not hater on Morgan Morgz the bested you tuber on YouTuber

bruh im a kid but I HATE TEH KIDS APP

The FTC has no right to sue content creators

<b>Remember when people thought they were going to die if coppa came?</b>

We need to start riot against Susan wabbajack

Ood1sout

Felix: &quot;anime avatar kids&quot;Also Felix: <b>anime avatar</b>

I really appreciate you making these kinds of videos explaining how YouTube works.  I have a small asmr  channel that I adore and I would hate for it to be flagged for kids, it&#39;s not inappropriate  and probably is kid friendly, but I don&#39;t want a young like 10 year old audience haha.

I just think everyone are idiots except for PewDiePie and the people who likes his videos, and subscribers.

Oop I&#39;m 9 oopsie

We’re all 9 year olds sooooo

Were no longer 9 year olds We grew up and know were19

Hazbin Hotel, Boku No Pico, Family Guy, Helluva Boss, South Park, Happy Tree Friends: <b>exist</b>FTC: It&#39;s Sued Time

Ur so cool  was my birthday and I wanna have a  I’m 555

I wasted my time whatching this video and did not understand nothing whats wrong youtube pew like if u read this plz thx

Youtube wanted to be taken seriously by MSM, that&#39;s what happens...

Well said.

Today is my birthday ! I just turned 19

Where is gloria borger!!

thake you

Next thing to happen on youtube is YouTube getting sued for being non kid friendly or family friendly but u can&#39;t be family friendly or kid friendly so if that does happen then everyone making videos is umm gone you could say

Please stop using the lords name in vain. PLEASE

Wouldn’t you be fine tho since you are living in the UK? They sue you and you can just be like ...No?

Coppa: existsGood YouTubers:I&#39;m in trouble

<a href="">13:36</a> DAAAAMN FELIX CHILL

Hey your to much what did morgz do to you

Pewds: *starts swearing in his video again&quot;19 year old me: HE&#39;S BACK!

How wonder there’s a YouTube kids ad permanently stuck on your YouTube title.

Pewds is going against YouTube by YouTube

Ugh Morgan I meant on the thing lol

Morg

I hate kids

<a href="">13:18</a> his response to being called transphobic tho

Yes finally moving up

Why is his forehead so shiny.

Why dont you make your own website and put your content their

Pewdiepie:youre 19 now!Me:but I just reached 18...Also me:ummm ok then...Thats my real age btw

PREACH

That’s KonekoKitten!!!!!
I&#39;m pretty sure all the comments that are spoken in the 3rd person, are dumbass kids.

This video touches basis on sooo much.

he is completely missing the point

Felix Morgan was cancelled when he first started he’s really cringe

YouTube: puts as many gay people in YouTube rewind as they canAlso YouTube: demonitizes you if you put the word gay in the title

I&#39;m never worried about these stuff,  every time there&#39;s something that &quot;will change YouTube as we know it&quot; but in the end nothing happens, today 2 months after coppa law started kicking in I haven&#39;t seen more people talking about it, it&#39;s like it despaired
