Pewds:&quot;19 year old grandma&quot; &quot;where did the owl learn how to drive?&quot;

&quot;I know people don&#39;t eat seals&quot;Inuit: bruh

This is my favourite video of him

I&#39;m here pew finally bonk bonk

I want to acknowledge and thank you for the Jewels you sent ME from heaven.  I love it.

The face swapped cat looks like the Lorax 

Anyone know anything about the mystery frog giver?

<a href="">6:02</a> the commenter’s name…. Cursed Iron Maiden

Robed

Panik

This video cheered me up the night before my grandmother&#39;s funeral. Thank you Pewds.

They indeed fricked and made bebe

heck that robber

i say, if an animal was bigger than you and it would try to eat you, its fair game to try to eat it

Someone tell redditpog they got their wish

bro did he not notice the huskys were laying on the floor.

<a href="">6:40</a> that&#39;s actually very creepy

<a href="">6:30</a> that&#39;s actually cool!

And now bebe

<a href="">7:06</a>

Little sister is secretly a big Juicer...

Average day in uk and Japan shitholes

<a href="">13:22</a> that was when he was filmed in a pizza commercial for stuffed crust before he became president

Just here to say : if u don&#39;t sweat at the gym people are jjuging u

<a href="">3:37</a> what was that!???

This is probably my 10th time seeing Jared. Jared lied.

I smiled ear to ear through the vid, it&#39;s soo damn wholesome 

The fact that Pewds nipped it in the butt that you shouldn’t be embarrassed to go to the gym because you’re working on your self is wholesome. Still great meme though

“That’s what grandmas do” MOVIE!!!

<a href="">10:21</a> RIP slippy

PewDiePie apparently didn&#39;t know that their are reprints of Blue Eyes White Dragon and that the guy is selling first ever print cards.

animals are delicous

That is a croc

Ode to joy will not stop playing in my head. I love it!

bebe reveal 2026

<a href="">7:41</a> he instantly became a ventriloquist for a few seconds

&quot;Why are all animals so blessed?&quot; Meanwhile, trapdoor spider.

Where i live some robbers are like,dude we are also human so we will just take one thing and go away or the person who is getting robbed starts talking to the robber aboot life,but some of them are just normal robbers

<a href="">4:42</a>Why does the cat look like Dr. Phil??? 

<a href="">4:56</a> he couldn&#39;t pronounce cappybara and now he petted and fed a real one in Japan

<a href="">02:36</a> little did he know his plans will come true, hold on guys may we be blessed like this man

@<a href="">2:35</a> Truer words have never been said.

That last advice really put me at ease. I really had to hear that.

<a href="">02:39</a> and he did! aw!

*Pewds getting robbed&quot;What a nice chance to look at memes&quot;

the dog with enormous health bar is the end boss :O

wheres the dark mode

that was the second time i&#39;ve seen jared

you can get an emotional support dog in nz

The Florida man  who slaped the woman is a shad

2 years ago... The time where pewd house in japan get robbed...And now he finally stay in japan  Omg time flows so fast

Now that Pewds already made it to Japan, I wonder if he already gave his new neighbors some gifts

don&#39;t need youright now

you are in japan now, so now it&#39;s time to give presents to all your neighbors

Terribly sorry to hear about the house in Japan. This is odd because crime is so low here. But glad to hear you&#39;re in Japan now. Can&#39;t wait to see new content from Japan.

If you send a random number happy animal images, you have wings. No need to check over your shoulders. Just flex.

<a href="">2:36</a>   little did he know..

Also another note Im terrified to go the gym because I have no fucking idea what I&#39;m doing or where to start and I&#39;m terrified some asshole will record me doing something wrong or something instead of telling me. I also live in a horrible asshole ridden town where my family is known for being the problem family&#39; we&#39;re not a problem family most of the kids that went to school in this town have learning issues and I have autism and ADHD and a learning disability. Instead of accommodating and educating themselves and doing their fucking job the teachers would actively mistreat several siblings of mine, older and younger.

Wait I literally just thought the emotional support animal was a world wide thing. I didn&#39;t know it was just an American thing that&#39;s very interesting

Japan robbed? Doubt

Dude in <a href="">11:14</a> is literally a chad

&quot;People don&#39;t eat seals&quot;Inuits: You sure?

playing the worlds smallest violin for you.

tower of huskies is gonna beat tambourine tower...

Bad things happen in 3’s. I wonder what the 3rd bad thing that happened was?

this is my comfort video. i come back multiple times a year and it never fails me.

I legit just got this video recommended to me the day I was almost robbed

<a href="">4:27</a> lol

<a href="">4:22</a> he said: What is wrong with this cat? When the real question is what is right with this cat.

Whoever stole from pewds this one goes out to you:       ᶠYͧoͨᵏu

That last one made my day

you can have  a &quot;emotional support dog&quot; in almost every country in europe buy you have to have some documents from psychologists

I’ve seen Jared 4 times now

ahh poor guy has two houses...

Good times :)

<a href="">1:32</a> you know what will be a great cursed ending to that story that him and his son stop a suspect black American trust him of not having a gun then the fathers get shoots and dies in front of his own son, then after the incident the son is a racist cop for his entire lifeThat would be epic

“She looks amazing, obviously”

still cant believe You got robbed and said Well i got robbed ANYWAY LETS WATCH SOME MEMES

Bruh

i can confirm. watching this vid 2yrs ago was the last time i have seen and heard of Jared. he&#39;s really gone.

&quot;Why do we eat animals they&#39;re so cute&quot;Well i could ask the same question but the opposite of it &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we eat animals they&#39;re delicious.&quot;

Sixth time jared sixth time… just sayin

Wait a minute I have two of those shinny blue eyes white dragons I had no idea I costed that much

Jamal and Grandma Wanda still meeting 

GOD BLESSED GODZILLA

The sponge bob one has 9.5 million views

I used to hear those bonkbonk toads growing up and now I know their names. Finally!!

<a href="">1:24</a>Me rewatching the video 

<a href="">14:54</a> I did this, and I can see a pair of slippers fl

Seals are actually sea puppies and you can&#39;t prove otherwise

I saw jared again

My dad is an animator and he worked on a few Courage The Cowardly Dog episodes.

For the most part emotional support dogs have to be trained.

Actually, there isn&#39;t a real consensus on whether a pregnant woman should give up smoking. Obviously, before you have a child, you should absolutely quit smoking because it is very bad for the child. When it is an accidental pregnancy, things get more complicated. Outright quitting can be very stressful, and that could also be unwise during a pregnancy, and yet every cigarette is harmful for the child. It is a matter of deciding which is worse. At the very least, a pregnant woman should cut back on the amount she smokes as much as possible.

My uni is full of dogs

<a href="">11:32</a> he just did the shortest merch plug ever

<a href="">9:14</a> I hope the vegan teacher sees this

We have the banjo frogs in New Jersey

&quot;I dont care about curing diseases, find the rat squel &quot;That aged well

Every Time I see u I remember about my dad

Rewatching this video everytime the day isn&#39;t very epic~ 

The goat looks like that sketchy 30 year old friend you never want your kid to bring home

Looking back, this video is jusssst before covid got serious.

<a href="">1:40</a> and ofc shoot autistic kids, and kill Floyd.

<a href="">5:10</a> the dog went on a Disney adventure and were about to see the full release film in 2022

When I found out I was pregnant last January I cut out everything cold turkey. I vaped and smoked weed, but that day I just stopped. If you don’t want to stop your bad habits then don’t get pregnant.

Poor bird was at the wrong place at the wrong time

moor video like this pelease pewdiepiop

Could have made a series called blessed or cursed and got fans to send memes and gifs.

I think pewds will be more suited towards the ‘Blursed’ Subreddit

Pewds finding his own pic in that sub always makes me happy

<a href="">12:02</a>

I’m Japanese.May your stolen thing return safely.

I send you toads <b>*kero kero*</b>

<a href="">9:18</a> Pewds, I can assure you that people do in fact eat seals, they taste great and I will continue to eat them delicious beings 

lol

the owl did not learned to drive, that&#39;s how it got into the accident in the first place! xD

The fact that I have seen Jared three times…..

Hm, 19 year old grandma, Hm.

<a href="">7:10</a>

7 42

I got a Opera GX pewdiepie youtube add on this video

&quot;I know people don&#39;t eat seals&quot; Alaskan natives be like: 

As a dutch person why must they arrest birds

<a href="">13:10</a> is blessed

<a href="">9:18</a> we eat seals from where I come from, we call them Muktuk

I did enjoy this vid

<a href="">2:36</a> and then the world shut down...

I found out recently that the Grandfather from the Thanksgiving post passed away, but they still do it every year.

Lol

Jesus is coming

For real tho Pewds, your wedding picture is awesome. Love both of your outfits!

I&#39;m pretty sure Emotional Support Dogs are a thing in some countries in Europe actually! I think it&#39;s amazing

<a href="">12:30</a> we actually had a random fox appear on our front porch one night it followed us around and we fed it for about three or two days and it became very tame and never came back after the third day since it probobly got shot since my dad made a post about it on facebook :(

<a href="">13:33</a> I like to take pizza slice, roll it into a pizza roll and then eat it, much faster to eat

A pewdiepie ad literally is in the video. I didn&#39;t even realize it was an ad.

And we thought Felix was weird for the way he ate his pizza

There&#39;s criminals in Japan?

<a href="">1:37</a> &quot;so you&#39;re shoot me like your dad did?&quot;

@<a href="">12:53</a> It&#39;s been almost two years since this.  Why have they not made bebe yet?

You’ll be sad to hear that the “grandma” post about coming over for dinner has a sad news. The grandfather, husband, of the “grandma” passed away within the last year or two.

My mother did not smoke or drink during my oldest brother pregnancy and he has bad allergies and had pneumonia while she smoked for me I nerve had to deal with allergies or anything

Satan is wholesome too Pewds

Best pewds vid!!!!

my jaw hurts from smiling so much

Whhhat?! Rn what do you mean not rn ?

*Pewdiepie*: people don&#39;t eat seals*people in the north pole*: Well, Actually

My sister eats pizza like that and she eats her burger as she rotates it

I&#39;m sorry felix, but people do eat seals. I&#39;ve heard they also use them for the oil from the fat. The folks in Alaska do it, not sure where else.

i neeeeeeed more

2nd time seeing jared

One time I saved a water hen while fishing.The water hen was caught on the hook of my fishing rod ,because it had tried eat the maggot on the end of it.So then I grabbed the hen and waited for my family to come over and help me get the hook out of its mouth.We finally got the hook out and he flew back into the water happily.

<a href="">1:23</a> me: rewinds video

For some reason Pewds yelling at Satan to go away really made my day

Felix is definitely a satanic worshipper, I’m sure of it. Like how he said “go away Satan! I don’t need you right now.”Is this a conspiracy theory? I think not. This is truth! He definitely made a deal with the devil.

WHAT? You never played tuber simulator? PFFFFFF

I love courge the cowdly dog. I wish I went to that school.

Pewds upload new videoMe: <a href="">8:02</a>

That&#39;s a Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza. All of the ads for it in the 90s had people eating it crust first. I&#39;d rather save the crust for last so that it&#39;s like every slice comes with it&#39;s own mozzarella stick.

I come back to this video every time I feel down

spongebob robbing a bank<b>gets a beauty blender sponge add</b>

<a href="">3:56</a> yAwShEe

When Felix said: Gramouflage i bursted in laugh.

I can answer the pizza one - I too eat like that. For me, I hate the crust because it&#39;s just plain bread, I eat that first and save the good part for last.

&quot;this is jared and you&#39;ll never see him again, say hi to jared&quot;me watching this video for the 5th time: GOD DAMN YOU JARED

I feel like I could just type Florida Man in Google and it&#39;ll come up with the strangest stuff.

Wt a fkin week man wt a week looking forward for it to end

“Why does the dog look so adorable”Because IT’S A DOG.

Pewdiepie: 19 year old grandma…

Thankks for the vidd

Sneaked isn&#39;t a word Felix, you went to Harvard and you should know that.

Emotional support animals can’t go in places. It just lets you have a pet in an apartment without being kicked out

When he said rip slippy I got some flashbacks I totally forgot all about slippy that’s crazy

<a href="">1:23</a> Jared!? I haven&#39;t seen you in forever

<a href="">13:30</a> Ok hear me out, I eat it like that because I like the crust the least so I end up eating my favorite part last.

Cows likes jazz It is true trust me.

<a href="">8:04</a> lmaoooo

The real Jared was the friends we made along the way

The debonair income contemporaneously taste because manager laparoscopically dress beside a aboriginal doctor. loose, lively court

The used recorder microcephaly slap because laborer curiously order via a repulsive shape. agonizing, charming copy

I&#39;m in the the UK and someone brought in a 5 week old husky, it fit in his hoodie pocket. It was cute

LOLLZZ WHAT IS THAT UNGODLY CREATUREEEE HAHAH

The spicy peony comparably confuse because bar simultaneously whip via a garrulous fork. unusual, abiding suit

I really like train spotting, and a few weeks ago a fox joined me, it was the first fox I had ever seen in my life, I love foxes now.

Heres something blessed, I was in a bike accadent the other day and if had just a tad more force, the handle bars would have stabbed me in the heart,  but what made it better was a guy in a car passing bye gave me a thumbs up, basically asking me if i was ok.

As much as the comments here contain so much &quot;He be rich as hell he can replace it&quot; I am so happy to see that everyone who understands sentimental value are the ones with 10x the thumbs up. Some people just don&#39;t understand that things like family members and animals just cannot be replaced. I swear half of the people who talk about insurance and PewDiePie just replacing things would more then happily sell there mother for money. To them I&#39;m sure they could just replace her. Without sentiment who will cry or morn them when they pass.Its seeing comments from @Leann 426, @Zowo, @Roseanna Huang, @ʟ ᴇ ᴍ ᴏ ɴ ᴄ ʜ ɪ ʟ ᴅ and just so many others that make me think there is hope out there in the human race.

Imagine being the robber and realising your stealing from the greatest YouTube sensation, you might as well of stepped into the popes house

<a href="">0:22</a>People who’s favorite character is samus are gonna have a riot

Me when I leave work &quot;see ya tomorrow, bye bye!&quot;

For all you people who dont get why Felix said the ctads where expensive when they where 299.99 Euros. In The E.U, they have decimals to represent thousands and so on amd they have commas for cents

I just watched a group of capybaras beat up a dog and drown it and started at the camera guy like he was next

We do eat seals. That&#39;s what the profession seal clubber is for. And they&#39;re delicious. Also their fur makes for fantastic inner lining for winter clothes

As a gymbro, regarding the gym thing. People at the gym tend to be there for one reason, and that is to work out. If you&#39;re overweight and at the gym the most people will think of you is &quot;well done mate for taking the first step&quot;. So don&#39;t be afraid, just do your thing, be healthy and if you need/want help just ask for it, 99/100 people there will happily help you with your technique or recommend routines. But don&#39;t bother people with massive headphones, they wear them for a reason.

My mom sold my blue eyes white dragon without telling me smh

I 100% support America’s emotional support dog system. Some people do take it far with using like ostriches, but other than that it’s great. One of my friends has an adorable Rottweiler that’s his emotional support animal

Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark.

LMAO THE MEXICAN PLACE THAT USED TO BE A CHINESE PLACE IS WHERE I USED TO EAT ALL THE TIME LMAO

You can have a emotionel support dog in Denmark and we think about getting one for my brother with autism

No Felix. We don’t eat seals. We either despise them or blow them out of the water.

I just realized Felix said 19 year old grandma instead of 91 year old grandma lol <a href="">0:30</a>

<a href="">12:26</a> don’t want to ruin the cute but he probably wanted to drag his body to a safe place to eat he was probably very concerned that his food woke up

I uploaded my profile picture hello٫ but it spelled hell instead.

The alarm just went of just when you spoke about it heheheh

ROFL,NEED TO YEET

ACAB

Hamilton was a Formel 1 driver and got in an accident and got burned really bad

I know Felix states that no matter your physical shape, you should not be embarrassed to be at the gym. I think that this is really good advice and need to think about this myself especially because I have felt often that something like this is much easier said than done, but he’s giving me inspiration to get out there and be myself. Pls like I want Felix to see this

People don&#39;t eat seals...<b>nervous laughter</b>

<a href="">7:43</a> his webcam froze

I eat pizza like trump ;-;

Bruh the dog who came back with bros literally lived an anime season.

If you would have noticed. Pewdiepie was actually sad. :(( fake smiling.

This is the first time I ever heard that something in Japan was stolen or robbed. What AU was this from?

Wait, there&#39;s crime in Japan?

&quot;I need to look at some blessed images on reddit to know the whole world isn&#39;t just rotten&quot;sorry pewds.. it already is..

There are banjo frogs in my area they are cool to listen to

Cog

mixed feelings about the slapping of the pregnant smoker, its the whole vigilante being good or bad debate all over again

“who are you?”“I send you toads” “fair enough”

It took me several years until I finally got to visit Japan. I had spent much time reading and learning about Japan and I had formed an opinion of a polite culture and a safe country. When I arrived in Tokyo I got to witness the first crime in my life when a dude bag robbed a girl right in front of my eyes.

Pewds:“I don’t care about curing diseases!!!”2020:”Are you sure about that?”

Bonjour

Haven&#39;t seen this video since I was published and it really helped me to feel a bit calm after having a really hard panic attack. Thanks pewds, you&#39;ve helped me a lot with my depression since 2012 and I hope life rewards you even more than it already has. Lots of love from Argentina.

I legitimately got Pewdiepie&#39;s ad and I thought it was in the video.. like.. he was baiting us.. guess not..??

<a href="">1:01</a> &quot;99% of people can&#39;t tell what animal is on this photo&quot;

PewDiePie is such a strong, brave person. Going through so much yet he&#39;s here, recording, editing, giving us content, just so we can smile. We truly do not deserve him.

Bye Felix

bonk bonk

simpppppppppppp

He was robbed by ninjas

btw u can have emotional support animals in uk for things such as anxiety

art: <a href="">7:27</a>

thinking about how felix says sharmander and i say charmander

I saw Jared twice, I&#39;m blessed

When he was talking about how emotional support animals are allowed in America, but won&#39;t fly in the UK I just wanted to talk about that. As far as I know, in order to bring your emotional support animal places where they normally aren&#39;t allowed, you have to bring paperwork. And as far as I know, that paperwork requires to be signed by a licensed therapist. If the UK doesn&#39;t allow emotional support animals, that is utter stupidity. Some people need their dog, cat, bird, or otherwise to function properly because they might be traumatized and their pets are the best way they can cope with it.

Ones I hand fed a baby chipmunk in the wild.

&quot;Why is this dog so adorable?&quot;I wonder why this paint smells like paint :/

Kirby is so cute in that jacket, I&#39;l say it, I&#39;l SIMP for kirby.
