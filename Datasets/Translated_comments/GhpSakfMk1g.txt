Very bad english, didn&#39;t understand anything.. Laca laca laca laca

I should be awarded &quot;best taste award in films&quot; for not watching one film from this list

Mrs serial killer oh god I cant stop laughing....

I did not see know half of movies in list existed

You know, Baaghi 3 would have been more reasonable if they had stuck to the original formula of &quot;Vettai&quot;, where they could have kept the conflict at a local level, such as Tiger fighting a local gangster and his gangs. The move to Syria was absurd, and just went over the top. Even if we take the movie &quot;Force&quot; which was a remake of the Tamil movie &quot;Kaakha Kaakha&quot;. They did upgrade the plotpoints a bit (changing the villain&#39;s gang from an Extortion/kidnapping gang to one of drug peddlers), at least they had the sense to keep things sane by staying in the boundaries of the NCB, and not going to...... say Afghanistan or some place like that.

I just died because my life gone in hell because I watched thos film in big screen on my birthday 🎂

Medal to all who didnt watch it 🥇 me too

Baaghi 4 is leading........ :P
Haven&#39;t watched a single one of them😂... M glad

Just wait for Bhool Bhulaiya 2, I am telling you you will add that one in this list.

Nice Video.

Most badass coolie no 1
Aah Varun in coolie no 1🤢🤮
I agree with all of these accept  Laxmi. Maybe it was watching it in theatre after a long time, with friends and having that atmosphere of being free from isolation protocols etc but I enjoyed that day at the movies.

Kiaras acting was good in indoo ki jawani better than machine

I am extremely dissapointed with Imtiaz Ali,David Dhawan as how they could satisfied with the Sara&#39;s expressions..how could such directors manage to say Ok to such worst acting

I didn&#39;t able to digest in sadak2 she is same girl who act brilliantly in highway udta Punjab dear Zindagi gully boy razzi Seriously how can alia chose sadak2 😑😑

And when a talent like sushant gets recognised.They kill him

I&#39;ve stopped watching bollywood movies cause of these new actors they can&#39;t act

Kiara in Indoo act very well, but the story and the content was, Oh my god 😆 they portrayed the moral very wrongly, yeah the script. 😆

I liked sara before but now this is too much, sara stop it 😆 she should at least go for acting class.

Worst Bollywood films in the decade<a href="">

You are starting to tease me...Ha ha ha ha ha ha
In terms of acting, Varun is better than Tiger. Varuns films like Badlapur October Sui Dhagha were good and his acting was also great. In Kalank too his acting was good but the film flopped. Tiger always chooses stunt and action based film which we can predict the story ( like Baghi 2,3) he should choose better scripts but till now Varuns works are better than Tiger.

Not only movies But the whole Bollywood is shitt🤢🤢🤮🤮
Great job💯👍👍👍
Khalee Peli film of Ananya Pandey should be included in this list.

I&#39;m unable to digest that Love Aaj Kal and Laxmii released in the same year. 2020 was a hell of a ride.

I am glad I heard about half names for the first time 😶

No. 2 goes to coolie no. 1 Then which movie is no. 1😨😨

Damn I didn&#39;t knew that these movies were releases coz I didn&#39;t saw any one of them.

Yes I&#39;ve been binge watching your videos, and no I don&#39;t feel guilty

I really like Shraddha Kapoor and her acting style, but can not seriously stand her acting in Baaghi franchise just for the sake of finance or reputation.

I did watch laxmi and yes, akshya&#39;s performance was over the top and there were occassions which were obviously unnecessary and offensive to trans people.

Tiger shroff has a lot of talent in gymnastics but not much in acting

Well kgf2, RRR,Pushpa and more are coming soon.

Make a 2021 version of this and pls put radhe on top 🤢

Kids in my home are a big fan of tiger shroff&#39;s baghi series🙄.. Don&#39;t know why

U and Saiman says are underrated YouTuber

COOLIE REMAKE IS THE WORST

WTF is that 1st movie?? Like r they fr? Wtf r they even thinking making such movies. Dude this is wrong on so many levels

me and my mother are huge fans of Akshay Kumar, ergo Akshay&#39;s performance still haunts us in our nightmares . the night we watched LB we had to rewatch Kaithi for a good sleep.

Lakshmi was a great comedy movie I&#39;ve seen loss of reaction on lakshmi and people enjoyed it and akshay kumar was great in this movie and he deserves the award because normally he doesn&#39;t get that much awards

I watched Love Aaj Kal 😭and can I just say that Sara cannot, for the life her, act.

I thought for a moment that honorable no.1 position would go to Radhe.. Unfortunately not.. 🤣🤣

How could you forget Khali peeli

can you review Sushmita Sen starrer &quot;Samay&quot;?

Lucky that I watched only 1 movie out of all these (Laxmii)

Sara sucks. Girl needs to get outside her head of cringey OTT acts

My friend forced and made me watch a complete cringe movie &quot;Laxmi bomb&quot;They spoiled a very good movie 😭Anyways Raghava Lawrence rocked it🔥Thank god I didn&#39;t watch any of the other movies which are listed😂

&quot;My life on the line &quot; watching 2020s bollywood movie.

I&#39;ve not seen these movies till date, nor will I watch......and I&#39;m glad ☺

The Baaghi franchise could have worked if the sequels were related and if Tiger Shroff stopped fighting tanks and helicopters.

Bollywood is making a lot of trashes nowadays.. nepotism...money...&amp; Cheap comedy rules... Pathetic!!

This movies killed more people than corona

Baaghi all parts are south best movies remake

This will not happen......-Sara Ali Khan
Tiger shroff doesn’t have any shirts..

I watch Bollywood movies once or twice a year. Let alone the worst ones.

TBH mostly children watch movies like coolie no 1. In my house only 6-7 years old watched that adults were way to fed up half hour in. Even the 9 year old thought that the movie makes no sense.

Dude. I have been hooked to your channel from past 2 days. Why every video is so relatable. 😅 It&#39;s like &quot;Yes, I thought the same.&quot; Keep up the good work.

I don&#39;t want to say this but why Sara always dissappoints with her acting??The only time I find her acting good was in Kedarnath...

Bollywood idiots, and idiot fans of bollywood

I am a huge Imitiaz Ali Fan, too. He just creates magic. His films like, &quot;Highway&quot;, &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;, &quot;Rockstar&quot;, &quot;Tamasha&quot; etc. are just too good and underappreciated.

Ugly Sara😭😭
Honestly I m impressed by Kartik and Randeep Hooda&#39;s performances in Love aaj kal 2 but Sara alone has ruined the movie to the core

Hey🙄

Am i the only one who hasn’t seen any of these movies. As such Bollywood is an aberration now. Watch Malayalam movies. Kerala make such amazing films. That’s pure talent!

These guy dumb he dissed 110 crore winning movie and dissing every that&#39;s  good

People who watched all the movies you mentioned are barave.

<a href="">#roadto1million</a>

Tiger schroffs movies are not good. Not a single One. He is Cute and make decent fight stunts but acting and movie choice big no no

Is this karthik aryan???? Sodumb once in a shw said he is very hot n ignored SSR. Bt he is nt evn close to SSR interms f looks. I mean Sushant was extremly talented and ws vry good looking.

Love ajj kaal and Baaghi 3 was shit

What should we do to get movies like Tumbbad? I stopped watching bollywood movies, and the only movie I have watched in the past 3-4 years is Tumbbad. That movie is a gold. Too bad the audience didn&#39;t recognise it

Varun dhawam   actor     he he he

Shame on bollywood writers now only remaking south movies

Baghi movies. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Love aaj kal was not that bad it was okayish

<a href="">6:10</a> I haven&#39;t watched a single movie but I am confused about Dilip Hathkata... I live in a village and here if someone don&#39;t have a leg, he is called Langra... Or if someone can&#39;t speak, he is called goonga... I am really confused about your line as if you live at a place where they don&#39;t call you by a distinct feature of your body. I know its wrong but they just show the reality in the film.

Baaghi se Baago
Unpopular Opinion - The story of love ajkal wasn&#39;t actually so bad. The acting was really bad tho!

Akshay Kumar got some award for this film...crazy

Liked that liu kang reference from mortal kombat

Chal j punjabi ni andi ta kam se kam hindi e bol le
I really liked mrs serial killer ..I found it funny

Can you please watch  “A suitable girl” (it’s available on Netflix GB don’t know about India)? Thank you

Thanks you,you are making this video in English so that everyone can understand

Jacqueline rejected girl on the train for Mrs. serial killer She is gonna regret and Parineeti looks fab in the trailer

Don&#39;t offend with me but i don&#39;t want to see Akshay Kumar as young man like laxmiPlease stop that now

Only kartik Aaryan performance in love aaj kal was appreciable 🔥🔥🔥

Sara ali khan over acting ki dukan
Bollywood sucks...😤
<a href="">7:55</a> sad reality of society

Watched Laxmii just for Sharad Kelkar sir&#39;s performance and I don&#39;t regret watching his performance✨😊But yes  regretted watching the rest except Sharad sir&#39;s work😂

ok i be honest maybe it was a mistake that varun did this film but i think he did it only for his dad i mean who wouldn&#39;t help his dad and his other films are amazing so dont troll him for this the film was not good bc if saras disgusting overacting

I am eagerly waiting for Varun Dhawan to make Raja Babu so that I won&#39;t watch that as well

Thank god i didn&#39;t watch a single movie
I didn&#39;t know these movies exists... Even if i knew i would never watch btw....

&quot;even have capability to make manoj bajpai over act.&quot;😆😆😆😆

Why did I watch this.

I Can&#39;t believe Varun Dhawan in coolie no.1 is the same actor from the movie Badlapur..i had such high hopes for him when i saw that movie.

Arushi ma&#39;am (Love Aajkal) was my college senior. She&#39;s immensely talented and a great human being.

I hate laxmi movie because he totally copied movie.....😂

After sushant singh rajput sir death i hate indian bollywood industry😐😕

Maybe bagghi 4 will be the remake of Avengers endgame 😂😂😂😂😂😂

When Coolie No. 1 came on 2nd position I wondered what can be worst then this.

Make some more sensible videos like you&#39;ve always did.

Jabby- I think it&#39;s quiet interesting to know about the most painful ventures we endured either in theater or the ott platform. Also Jabby- shows a picture of Kartik Aryan and Sara Ali Khan wrapped in a pitiful embrace from the movie &#39;Love Aaj Kal&#39;. Me- I can see where this is going...

To all north IndianRealistic movie&#39;s do watch malayalam, Tamil and Marathi moviesMass movies Telagu and Tamil movies.Kannada industry you can watch kgf 1 and 2 and many other great movie&#39;s on ott

Boycott Bollywood nepo kid&#39;s

boycott boycott <a href="">#botcott</a>
I hated laxmi and I want my time back from Akshay..

Thank god! I chose NOT TO WATCH any of these films! XD

Bas news is nowadays bollywood stories sucks.... Good news is I haven&#39;t watched any movies mentioned in the video...

Everybody is praising acting talent of akshay Kumar. But i feel he is such a worst acter i had ever seen.

I like Kiyara 😘😘😘😍😍
Lakshmi movie is remake of tamil movie kanchana..kanchana is a very good movie bcoz it had fun romance evrything in a crct mix but the special thing is the transgender story which was very convincing...but i couldnt understand why bollywood people didnt like that kind of movie

Thanks god. I didn&#39;t watched a single movie in this  list

I didn&#39;t even know a film called virgin bhanupriya existed!

I am really feeling proud on myself that I have not seen any of the movie from this list😂🤣

I&#39;m glad I haven&#39;t watched any of these movies 😎😎😎

Both Karthik Aryan and Sara Ali Khan had a constant constipated, whiny look through out the film , it was more like a movie on being in love while constipated 😑😑 Sara, Kartik, and Jacqueline should just quit films and do every one a favour ..,hats off to you for actually sitting through and watching these heap of trash they call movies 🤢

Apart from ur content I love hearing you ...ur voice is just so soothing ❤️

Alia is good actress but sadak2 was really bad, she mst hav nt done this movi

Tiger , varun n kartik aryan ovrrated actor
I didnt expect Sarah to be this worseOmg..Even Ananya who is trolled the most acts better than her...

God bless me for I haven&#39;t seen single movie from this list😌

Making fun of men getting raped is the shitty thing I ever heard

I TOTALLY AGREEE ABOUT INDOO KI JAWANI....SOOO PAINFULLL..HORRRIBBLEEE

Varun in the thumbnail oh my gaawd 🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watch Pakistani dramas
2020 : started from love aj kal ! 2021: started from kgf chapter 2 treasure ! We can see the difference ! I hope this year will be good!

The way you speak and keep your points, it&#39;s really made me a fan of u in less than a month😊

Hey bro jammy I&#39;ve been watching your reviews for some time nowCould you please review our eros now movie Jamun and its title track aise hain ye Jamun Would like to know your honest review 👍😊

Thank God I am away from bullywood.

As much as i love shraddha, i am sooo disappointed in her choice of movies. She said no to saina nehwal biopic so she can do street dancer?

Sadly I was tortured by only Akshay Kumar&#39;s LAXMI.........what a disaster..........And I laughed so much watching this video........dalip hathkata who doesn&#39;t have a hand......aur nahi hua to attack kar de sale pe.....abala bhi hum hai aur tabla bhi hum hi bajayenge.........

Painful ventures😂 reboots &amp; remakes nobody asked for😂👍🏻👍🏻Humorous &amp; Apt
So proud to say that I&#39;ve seen none of these

Such a chutiya thing to say that sharad performed well in laxmi.. not at all I was more disappointed in him.. that death scene was so over the top and fake.. so please dont be favoring the bahubali voice over

In short Bollywood sucks ;)  some of the movies are really good but ONLY some. Kpop is truly better than this shit and I&#39;m glad i don&#39;t watch these movies lol-

bollywood is degrading very fast . one day we all will watch a shaktiman remake with shitty dialogues and cgi having all great actors but their talent being wasted in one movie andshitty storyline that is just copy-pasted from some marvel movie . and it still would be a HIT BECAUSE THE TODAY&#39;S GEN AUDIENCE WHICH LOVES BOLLYWOOD  HAS -10 IQ .

I still remember when I first saw one of Sara&#39;s interview I was over the top thinking finally Bollywood will have someone like Emma Watson and Natalie Portman who is educated and a brilliant actress :3She literally proved me so wrong ..She can&#39;t act at all :3

After watching mrs serial killer the serial killer from ratsasan commited suicide.

Finally, someone give honest reviews about these pathetic movies.

Mrs Serial Killer was not bad. Ap jyada bol rahe ho. youtuber ho apni aukad mein raho

Your voice is magical and your english is opp

HAHAHAHAHAHA.....TO VIRGIN BHANHUPRIYA AND BHAGI 3.....REALLY TOO MUCH EMBARRASSING

The same Varun dhawan have done films like badlapur and October😔....

Sara &amp; Saif are totally different. Saif is one of the best actor, kya acting karta hai and Sara, yaar!!

Unfortunately I watched Laxmi😑I regret it

Film fare award 2021: Best actress:Alia Bhatt for Sadak 2 and Sara Ali Khan for   coolie no 1Best actor:Varun Dhawan for Coolie no 1

Guilty of watching Mrs Serial killer and Laxmiii. And been a victim too to the unbearable torture 😫

True.... Time wasting movies 😝

Dilip hath kata is actually a rip off of a goon named hath kata Dilip from Bengal...

How people love sara and Ananya? they both awful actresses.

BAAGHI 4 - official remake of avathar 😎

Little correction baaghi 1 is  a remake of tollywood film VARSHAM starring PRABHAS

Thankfully, I have never experienced these traumas.

I hv seen Laxmi n Coolie no.1...bad experience ABT acting n performance 🥱👎🏻
Laxmi was good movie.Aap chutiya ho.Make story with conviction n truthfulness not out of jealousy.And who gives a fuck about south movies nobody knows about their movies until it is remade by bollywood

I made the mistake of watching laxmi bomb...😂

😂

Sara ki do movies....worst movies me...
1 virgin bhanupriya2 coolie no 13 sadak 24 Laxmii5 MRS serial killer6 Indoo ki jawani7 baghi ​​38 love aaj kal
bollywood: let&#39;s make another trash movie with dumb jokes and un required songs and with a senseless storyline.audience: we will watch it anyways long as there is famous actors in it.

Thanks to Covid19, we are saved from watching such movies at theatres

Bollywood people only makes comedy movie,

Bruh don’t give away the spoilers at the beginning of the video.

Wish I could say I didn&#39;t watch any of these, but alas, I fell for the Manoj Bajpai one. Great cautionary list though 👍

I love ur voice( i would love if i get to play with someone with no crappy mic and a beautiful+non-raging voice in games)

Never ever call Sara Ali Khan an actress. For a starter she has got so many movies. All she does is bullshit. One more thing - if she speaks well in her interviews does not make her a good actress. Stop this trend.

glad i havent seen any of them except &#39;Love aajKal 2&#39; (as Love aajkal is still a favourite Movie in bollywood romcom after Lootera or equally) and Laxmii (cz heard alot about Kanchana and just to know LGBTQ community psychology), every other movie was garbage from their Title and trailers

Honestly, I didn&#39;t know 5/8 of these movies ever releasing or anything

Thank God! I haven&#39;t seen any of them!

Installment of franchises nobody asked for... Perfect 😂😂

The last hindi movie I watched was Dangal, so choose wisely, live well. Glitz, looks, glamor, fancy, fantasy, overacting and unrealism = thats what bollywood is.

Ban AK for Laxmi.!!

Mrs.Serial killer. What a comedy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And I got an ad of coolie no.1 🙂

<b>I literally didn&#39;t watched any shit from this. Wow</b>

Tollywood is also garbage

Thankfully I missed all of them....😁👍🏼

Happy to seen the name of Laxmi boom in the list. others movies are direct shit, but laxmi has a rap on it

Baaghi  2021 -. Tiger vs COVID 😂😂
The whole life of varun depends on Act, like other legends like Govinda, he don&#39;t have their own charm to act and pull Audiences towards him.

we always condemn nepo kids and crass commercial movies yet support them plz support socially responsible cinema

Kgf 2 is going to destroy every wood in India

Happy New year jammy keep it up you will keep us awaken god bless you always.

Baaghi is the rip off of the telugu film Thadaka

Sara ali khan- really really she should understand &quot;Tumse na ho payega&quot;.Only &quot;want to be an actor&quot; doesn&#39;t give u acting capability 🙏 please change your career

I stopped watching movies...my last movie was endgame

Thankfully I didn&#39;t watch all the movies except for love aaj kal as we didn&#39;t have any other Choice when we were asked my friends to choose a movie and this was the only hindi movie in a pool of South indian movies so we had to choose it. Have to admit it as the worst storyline of 2020. Even Randeep Hooda brilliant acting could not save it and other actors acting except for the other actress was worse. Avoid this movie as much as you can 😂😂

This is the reason why i got into kpop and kdrama

That&#39;s why I chose Animes over this stupid bollywood crap.

What a miracle you have created on the name of Sadak 2.
The only good thing about Love Aaj Kal was &quot;Shayad&quot; song 😂

I was truly taken aback when you showed a clip from bulbbul and I was like, dude didn&#39;t expect this from you. But thank god, it&#39;s just a mislead. 😂

Dear Jacqueline, please remove her from Bollywood.
Laxmi was transphobic asf?? Why is there no mention of that??

The end of Bollywood has started

I know it&#39;s a list of 10 movies but still according to me one movie is left behind. It&#39;s non other than khaali peeli

Only good varun dhawan movie-BadlapurAnd maybe october

I personally loved love aajkal 2 because it show cases the mixed feelings at its best..  how the influence of society, lifestyle, expectations, etc have changed person perceptions towards love to the bare necessity that how human is still emotionally available and attached easily... Only Imtiyaz Ali has guts to break the stereotype and show how people can be in love with one person but still Infidelity issues, movie also show parental influence on personal love life when Zoye backs off in family dinner..movie capture another depth with last scene which leave audience to their imagination of whether they stayed together or they left each other for someone else...the movie was hard hitting reality of this generation where love blooms but falls apart and how easily we all give up.

Sad to see Urvashi getting such horrible projects. Roles with one item song and minimal acting would be much better for her.

Dilip Haathkatta should have been Dilip Nihattha

I was laughing out loud while watching Mrs Serial Killer. They way Manoj Bajpai kept asking Comedy kahan hai... It reminded of popular Gangs of Wasseypur meme Chabhi kahan hai.

If  coolie no 1 had same story of the new coolie no 1, then i really doubt the taste of hindi audience. Such shit are the classics of that industry? I mean every single old hindi film is shit with melodrama. There is no substance to any of ur films. Watch Malayalam cinema from 60&#39;s to present. Even the 90&#39;s film are far ahead of these times.

Am i the only one who understood and liked Love aaj kal 2?😂

Good that I didn&#39;t watch and never had any idea of listing them in my watchlist. We now prefer content, plot over fandom/stardom. Audiences are not like &quot;eh my favourite actor&#39;s movie is coming, I desperately need to watch the movie&quot;. Period!

Bollywood is like inconsiderate piece of shit for me!

The first Baaghi movie was a remake of the Telugu movie Varsham

I really do feel for the narrator and the video editor that they had to watch every single movie to explain all these in this video. 😢

Shitty year, shitty movies 🤣

Love Aaj kal&#39;s story was great but the actors ruined it, I believe

Make review on ankur arora murder case

Sara is the worst actress i have ever seen.

Proudly didn&#39;t watch these 8 movies . My 2020 was not that bad

Boycott Star Kids (Sara, Varun, Sonam, Alia)
Pat on me that I didn&#39;t waste my time on these movies. And, I didn&#39;t know a movie like Virgin Bhanupriya exists.😄

justice for SSR that&#39;s all I wanted to say!

I don&#39;t know why bollywood biggies produce or act in the remake of such local films, which is already bagged alot appreciation not only in the original, but in the dubbed hindi version. Isn&#39;t it waste of money, time and talents

After watching kanchana  trailer I decided not to watch it. But my husband  is great fan of Raghava Lawrence and he want  to  watch  this movie, I remember how many time I stopped him then end up watching  this movie  with him, but I had stopped in half  way. Then he stopped  and said &quot;I can&#39;t  bring my last 2 hours back&quot;. I only watch movies after watching  trailers   if they gave me a kick or I don&#39;t  watch. Now we me and my family  only watch sauth indian movies and I love how they are experimenting  on new style.( Before  any  one point it out I am woman and my account  is under my husband  name).

Dilwale better than Inception- Mr Varun Dhawan

I left watching Bollywood movies since past 5 years. For entertainment I like to watch Hollywood movies and Japanese Anime 🔥🔥🔥.

Saara Ali & Varun Bakwas
&quot;Abla bhi hum hain, tabla bhi hum hi bajayenge&quot; is the kind of brilliant writing I miss in these new age sensible bollywood movies.

Sara Ali Khan&#39;s acting is so irritating

I&#39;m so lucky... Bcoz I didn&#39;t watch any of these films😂😂😂😂

Thank you Sara for giving us not one but two reasons to hate 2020, way more than we had to.

I&#39;ll never be able to understand how people like annoying Ananya and sara keep getting roles. Their acting skills are so cringey, common bollywood it&#39;s 2021 for heaven&#39;s sake. Get over yourself.

Top worst shows please .... And I want Fab life of Bollywood wives tops it

T

Most welcome (as you said Thanks)

All these films except a few were meant for single screen mass entertainment. These kind of films have no place in ott where content dominates. You see, even a baaghi 3 opened up to 24 cr...despite people knowing it would be a bad film. Theatres and ott are poles apart. Several Content films getting appreciated on ott have high chances they miserably flop in theatres. Also, to be very honest, even if coolie no. 1 released in theatres it would have atleast garnered  80-90 cr business considering the fact that its pirated copy has more lakhs of downloads just from one site (and not matter people will share that file with more friends)

Disliked bcoz akii acted osm in that role fock u man don&#39;t underestimate real gem the akki

Baaghi 3 is not a movie.

Jammy you should become the chairman of the censor board.👌👌👌👌👌

Add to this is AK vs AK. Another stupid movie not worth watching.

The only good movie hindi cinema that i have watched last decadeGang of wasseypurAligargShahidMasaanTumbaadI dont even watch crappy commercial movies.Masaan is best movie for me

Akshay is like Toyota, ek k baad ek film banate jao but either the film came out average or not quality movies.

Laxmi is better than the coolie no 1 remake

You forgot to add gulsbo sitaro

Too happy i didnt watch any of the  8 movies you mentioned!!!!!! Anyone else here who didnt watch any of these?

I also only liked laxmi bomb because of sharad kelkars performance.

It&#39;s been a while since imtiaz ali has become imtiaz tatti

Why still not 1M ?jammy all the best to you

Hindi movie is at its end because of nepotism....

Plaa make movie review on Animes

Ok

To me, Bhaagi 3 tops the list by mile..... So angry at myself for even deciding to even watch this movie ..

SaraAliKhan - worst performer of the year. Overacting

Bhaagi 1 is remake of telugu movie done by prabhas&#39;s &quot;VARSHAM&quot;. Climax of bhaagi 1 copied from raid redemption .

You forgot &quot;Durgamati&quot;...It&#39;s literally sucks yrrr

Laxmi bomb was a good movie though

&quot;Liu Kang from mortal Kombat&quot;I see you are too a man of culture 😁

Thank goodness I didn&#39;t watch any of these films...

Still your channel is underrated Jammy

Excellent review! Loved the perspective and the mode of delivery 🦋❤️

Khaali peeli 😂😂??
Laxmi was the worst.

Pick up any bollywood movie and it will turned out to be a remake of some movie either from US, UK, Korea, Hong Kong or from Tollywood. Originality has been missing from Bollywood since its beginning. Although the songs were original , but today we can&#39;t even get any original songs

Actually Bhaagi was remake of Telugu film &#39;Varsham&#39; starring Prabhas and Trisha and Raid Redemption was adopted for the climax fight.

Can u pls make best movies of 2020

Wish you many many happy return of day Jammy

2020 top underrated movies?

Indu ki jawani was very irritating 😭

Oh man. U just said what i had in heart for longv😂😂💪💪💪

We should export tiger Shroff to usa in defence deals

Rambo or commando is superb but baaghi 3 is intolerable ? Hypocrisy

Wow! I can see this comment section becoming more of a Sara criticism stop... And i actually like this, because i know she does not deserve it and is still getting it.I really wonder what people are thinking when they say they are fans of Sara Ali Khan!🤦🏻‍♂️SMH

I didn&#39;t even know most of those movie were made 😅😂😂😂

Here I m waiting for KGF 2.0

I as a woman am disgusted by &#39;abla bhi hum hain tabla bhi hum bajayenge&#39;. Fucking arseholes making shit content.

Respect for not putting any ad in this video

Hey Anmol, your channel is going great. Please do a review of the movie Pagalpanti (2019). Thanks!

Thank God I only watch love aaj Kal 2020 ..... than I stooped...... bro why did u not  add race 3..... I heard only stories about it and it gives me chills......

How cud anyone like n find Sara Ali Khan n alia Bhatt bful...hve u seen her in person

Forgot &quot;khaali peeli&quot;
I&#39;m proud of myself that I haven&#39;t watched any of these masterpieces! 😅 Heck, I didn&#39;t even know there were movies named Indu ki Jawani and Virgin Vanupriya! 😒

Sweets are there only 8 ?

I can&#39;t believe how well our thoughts matched on the mentioned movies!!! Seriously unbelievable!!

Love Aaj kal was fucking good.

Where is Gunjan Saxena?? The protagonist deserves an Oscar for mind blowing performance :-)

I don’t how but I missed all the above mentioned movies .. Though I am  the one who watches almost all the movies that is available in internet or cinema hall but this year somehow I managed to dodge all the movies here..

Love you

Laxmi was a bad movie but akshay&#39;s performance was amazing 🔥🔥

Jawaan jaaneman should also be in  this list...

Star kids should be treated like outsiders monopoly of family and offsprings should be totally eradicated then maybe bollywood may shine

Imagine bollywood remake Indiana Jones and raiders of the lost ark

Baaghi3 should be 1st in this list

Totally not watching bollywood since many years now!!! Sitting through even some so called good movies in theatre or online platforms has become mentally disturbing thanks to this whole drama and prejudice that these stories persistently pushed on its audience and the relentless heroism too... movie should be an art form, telling a good story, unless they stop creating stories to fit the actors, rather pick the actors suited when they have a good story on hand .. this will never change.

Boycott bollywood

MRS SERIAL KILLER KAB AAYI

Your reviews r getting better day by day.I guess u might b the best movie reviewer in India.

Worst Bollywood movie is coolie? Well its already on the verge of being a commercial success.  Yes the movie was not upto the mark but i guess more of hatred towards varun being a nepo kid its made it to the top. Am gonna see when he does Ekees movie how many will appreciate or watch it.

Lmaooo haven&#39;t seen any of these movies...

Wonder why Sara always has her constipation face on!

I hate this Thing Why MAN PEOPLE MAKE MOVIES FOR US TO HAVE FUN AND U HAVE TO BREAK ARE HEADS 🤬🤬🤬🤬
Please review Ram Prasad ki tervi..

👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 All Movies
Not watched any single movie in this list and totally not aware about 2 movies

The one good thing about 2020 is people started realizing that Bollywood makes crap movies.

Brother, I have not seen any of these movies. Thank god 🙏
Jammy have you watched paurushpur? The alt Balaji series? Can you please do a review of it. I haven&#39;t and tbh I don&#39;t really want to either. Still, I would like to hear your take on it. I have heard it has been created along the lines of &quot;The Game of Thrones&quot; which I find crazy! Lol! Cuz, from the trailers that I seen of the alt Balaji series (a few) it doesn&#39;t look more than just a sex and sleaze fest to me. Please do a review.P.S : Happy New year ❤️

Anmol, the writing for your videos is too good. Precise and insightful. Kudos to you if you do it yourself, kudos to your team, if at all there is one. God bless.

Mene to bs laxmi movie dekhi to sbse worst to mere liye whi h  baki movies to dekhne ki himmat hi nhi hui 🤣😂

I didn&#39;t watch any of them😂

Bollywood precisely banks upon south films which  are not norm of current time &amp; audience (or) its own remake... Way to go...

How big directors take Kartik Aryan and Sara and expect them to act,Akshay, Alia Bhat, Varun and Paresh Rawal look below par,the last one Paresh Rawal should retire and chamchofy Modi

Love Aaj Kal 2 and Mrs Serial Killer were fine not sure why they made to the worst list.

We boycotted bollywood anyway, justice for SSR

It’s almost all the movies from this year lol

Kiara&#39;s guilty was worse climax in 2020

Make videos in Hindi. It will get u more audience

Great job brother,You are utterly true !

Don&#39;t know why, I&#39;m not ready to accept Love Aj Kal to be the one of the worst 😤

I am the only one I guessJiss na enn main sa 1 bhi movie nahe daki Hain 😂😂

Boycott remake
Result of nepotism

While her interviews made me think Sara is intellectual, her movies confirmed otherwise. FACT : Actions speak louder than words.

number 1 should have been coolie no1

I have not watched any movie from no.2 to no.8 but I have watched no.1  i.e virgin bhanu priya .Movie is of 2hrs or 1hr 50min &amp; I have watched that movie in 2x speed + forwarding some scenes and completed that movie in 45 to 50 min. But that 45 to 50 min was really like a torture and was unable to understand why these type of movies are made as there is not any big name associated with the movie for whom audience will watch.Really cannot understand

Laxmi cringy

So happy didn&#39;t watched any of them

Baghi 3 worst logic ever seen😂😂

I haven&#39;t watched not even one

Jammy you need to edit the intro credits a bit.. You&#39;re doing not just Bollywood analysis..

Can you review cobra kai

I&#39;ve not even watched a single of these movie. I don&#39;t like to watch movies to be frankjust here for jammys review

Jai Mata di bachaa apne 2020 aur in movies too, Jai bholay 🙏🏻
Thank God I didn&#39;t watch the single movie out of all this

Bollywood...enough...grow up....nobody in India loves nonsense dialogues and stupid actions.......i would say south film industry is presenting atleast a better version of movies....

man talented actors are making these movies if you look closely Akshay, Alia Bhatt , Aditya Roy Kapoor(kabhi to script padhle Bhai)Sanjay Dutt ,Varun Dhawan(3-4 dum movies and thena good one)

Jammy please review Ramprasad ki tehrvi.🙏

I haven't seen any of these... 🤣🤣😝😝🤪🤪🤭🤭🤭
I feel proud of myself ..I haven&#39;t watched any one of those movies. .I rather chose to watch Korean drama ..

When coolie no.1 was second on his list, I was really surprised. What could&#39;ve been worse? And then...

Lakshmi Buri Nahi Thi Sir, people are speaking bad from the Muslim angle. This is not true, whereas the best performance was by Akshay Sir and you did not talk.
Review, the white tigers pls.

Glad that I haven&#39;t watched any of it 😂

GULLAK Season 02 is coming on 15th jan on SONY LIVAb toh review kar dena. This series needs recognition

While talking about Laxxmi you should&#39;ve also spoken about the absolutely outrageous representation of trans women. To say the least, it was inaccurate and so deeply drowned in stereotypes. Its song uses the pronouns he/him even tho they claim to be showcasing a trans WOMAN.

Sara Ali Khan acting = new strain of coronavirus 😂🤣🤣🤣
Where is Rasbhari bro?
The pain you go through 😌🙃

I think bollywood shd stop remaking...old movies or other language movies why they are not preparing a good story to release

lol I live for Jammy&#39;s sass

When the FUCK is this channel gonna reach a million subs !!!! I&#39;ve been seeing it and it&#39;s been stuck at 800K for a while , this channel deserves more subs for the type of content it produces , it goes to showing how much of the Indian audience actually cares abt content

That wonder woman scene in bhaagi wtf was that

Where is Ankit&#39;s comment? @Only Desi 😏

Bro liked ur valid points that u explained for claiming each of movies unbearable !!!

Oooo god what torture that acting of sara and varun was in coolie..... Bollywood will collapse if these star kids are not stopped please

watch trailers of some these movie but didn&#39;t watch any.. even I find much enjoyable to watch barun sobties web series  &quot;asur&quot; and movie &quot;halahal&quot; both are better then these type of azaira movie😑

Even kaira is as annoying and irritating as sara....Jacqueline,kriti sanon,taapsee and bhumi also r good for nothing when it comes to acting.always same genre and nothing new to offer and also very very underwhelming performances

Love aaj kal 2020 was good because  I didn&#39;t watch Love aaj kal 2009

Varun overacts most of the times but atleast he is adorable.But sara Ali Khan is so annoying and irritating.she makes such faces tats such a pain !!! Too overrated and way too fortunate to get movies

The way jammy roasts these movies and star kids is the exact way I want to roast my relatives ...rishte bhi khatam na ho or bezzati bhi ho jaye 😂😂😂

Am I the only one who didn&#39;t watch any of these ??

Sara Ali Khan is the most wooden actress, with zero acting talent. The days of macho heroes with no talent except jumping around is over. The audience is fed up of these hyped Bollywood stars with bloated egos with plastic bodies and faces.They r shit looking with shit acting, if only they realize this.

Still people will 🏃‍♂️ for varun,tiger🤦‍♂️
Sad thing is that majority of us realised this only after Sushant&#39;s death, or else such movies would have easily reached 70-80 cr mark, judwaa 2 is enough as an evidence..or we can say pandemic gave us some free time and evolved our minds😅

SARA ALI KHAN is OVERRATED!!!!!! PERIOD!!!! She literally SUCKS in acting!!  We don&#39;t need a good speaker in interviews but actor in movies... Lmao

Absolutely worst... Movies  .. Absolutely true your review 😁

U know what! Actors like Varun, Sara, Kiara, Ananya or Tiger Shroff are here becuz they have good heart and knows the mindset of the industry well... Only bcuz of that they are able to get films and also they work hard to build their personality... Acting-wise, i think they really failed... It scares me that they are many people favourite actors not bcuz of their acting but bcuz of their looks or shape or their good heart

To answer your question about <b>&quot;What did Netflix see in the Mrs. Serial Killer film?&quot;</b>Well basically <i>Paisa Sab Kuch hai boss!!</i> This leads to several garbage content being chucked into Netlfix/MX Player/Alt Balaji/Amazon Prime; some of which is cringy, illogical and unwanted!

Sara Ali Khan will continue to disappoint just like janhvi, ananya and the upcoming nepo kids. But u guys are too busy drooling over her fake interview persona. <b>Slow claps</b>

Most of Indian actors/actresses depend on looks.. they lack pure talent

Bhaagi 3 is literally mocking the deaths of innocent people....yaha real life mein koi superhero vero nhi ayega

Add Nawaz&#39;s Ghoomketu also...

Jab bollywood rahega tak public mad nahi gaya hai, life sikhs are gone without them in lockdown, still many people are living without them.
I wonder how sara keeps on geting casted in movies despite the cringe acting...(NO OFFENSE,  JUST A OPINION)✌

Bro criminal justice behind doors review plz

Hey Jammy. Do a video on top 10 bollywood scenes which became memes ;D

Haven&#39;t watched any of these movies... So proud of myself right now 💯

Entire Bollywood is a trash can of worst performances and movies.It must have been hard work to pick ONLY 8 among them. Take a bow bro!

It takes me only one reason to hate Sara..i don&#39;t know why i really get irritating when i see this bollywood people..I&#39;m here just to say this..byebye

‘Wow’ the sigh you hear in his voice😂 <a href="">6:13</a>

Agree with you I think we have grown up and nonsence like this is not worth watching

Please do face cams........🙏 I want to see your expressions when you personally go through these types of movies to tell us about them......😂😂. It will be hilarious. BTW love your content.

Finally somebody spoke about Akshya Kumar.He is just an average actor for me, recently he had wise choices of movies but all of them had average performances. And comeon! you cannot fake patriotism everytime to fool the audiences! I think audiences are wiser now!!

Honestly audience for malayalam movies had a good time.... I hope you watch our movies.

Well put

I don&#39;t envy your job . Having to endure love aaj kal , coolie no 1 and saadak2 in the same year . As well as to having to review a Virgin bhanupriya with a straight face and not throwing up , Thanks for keeping us entertained through a grim and gnarly 2020. Look forward for more during 21

I hv stopped watching bollywood movies look at my name I am a blink now and also trying to be a part of many fandoms also I watched 2 kmovies and watched 14 kdramas those who think of becoming kpopstan or kdrama stan do it trust me you won’t regret it it’s amazing

One word review for all these movies<a href="">#sucks</a>😂😂😂😂😂😂

Sorry to say but SARA ALI KHAN tortured us more ..... compare to VD or Tiger shroff

Sara Ali Khan is like priyanka chopra of Hollywood .. I mean she&#39;s only good with her interviews

Wow I didn&#39;t see any

Keeping the list aside, the way you said &quot;Thank you for watching&quot; at the last..made me watch the other videos of your channel..

Thank you for your Updates

&quot;Nainital Krish&quot; 🤣🤣🤣😭😭


Check out nirvana inn 🙏
Jammy please review paurushpur as soon as possible plzzzzz.....eagerly waiting for your views on it

Watch evaru from Telugu on Amazon prime . Which will blow your mind

I feel like you missed kaali peeli
Brother, are you ashamed of speaking Hindi? Well, society knows, this is the condition of everyone, which is based on western culture.
I only watched Baaghi3 out of all these movies, and I didn&#39;t like it at all.

Dilip Hathkata 😂😂😂😂

I appreciate your work ,, but why are you selective only for Bollywood movies for your videos on worst , bad bakwas movies or something bad about the content ..  you just devalue Bollywood,, each and every one down knew that these movie are going to be torture for the audience which demands a proper storyline with multiple segment in a movie .. but these movies were not meant for them ,, it was for the mass audience which you and I know are high in numbers ,, If you are so worried about Indian cinema so please also react to bakwas regional movies too..

Are u going to watch Ramprasad ki tehrvi? Review please.

These films should be added in police torture method list for criminals... Crime rate will definitely go down

20 th Century idiot Box compilation.. and these films keep coming every year... don&#39;t know when bollywood will learn

Ranbir kapoor is the only good thing nepo gave

Haven&#39;t watched a single movie in the list......Proud subscriber

That last line . So true!

Jammy are you gonna review that ALTBalaji webserise?  Although I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s bad but I wanted to know your analyses. And how can indian cenama creates a compelling historical series? I won&#39;t give the example of Game of Thrones coz it also feltered in the end

Sara ali khan n ananya pandey.. when they came n saw their interviews i felt that sara will go a long way for her sensibility n ananya needs to grow up first.Now i think y the hell do they want to b actors .Dont they watch hollywood movies n work of actors like irrfan n nawazudin n see they r jus not doing 1percent of it.. y cant u jus change ur career line or take a break n work on ur acting.Even when both of them came in kapil sharma show.. asking sara ki ek dum mast wali actress ki acting krke dikhao n she made a weird face n when asked to ananya about her talent n she said i can touch my nose with tongue.. i m 25 yrs old n a doctor n i dont want to see such insensible women on screen.

Well...not watched any of these 8 movies...just bcoz of ur reviews.Tq Jammy😂

One of my friends used to say that I looks like Sara Ali Khan, now she is my enemy and I&#39;m seriously not joking. Even my father says the same 🥺🥺

The reason why idiotic movies starring Varun and Tiger being blockbusters and the BJP winning almost every election is same. We in the metro cities can try and push for better ideas as much as we want, But Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities still crave for bullshit and they&#39;re greater in numbers.

Thank you for sharing all your candid but sincere &amp; thoughtful insights with us in 2020. Looking forward to more in 2021!

love u too, brother.

<a href="">4:45</a> Jacqueliiiiiiiiiine
I haven&#39;t watched any of them 😁

Ur channel is so underrated!!

I feel so proud of myself I have not watched anyone of them!🌚

I love your intro music ❤️
Can we just talk about bhaagi every part has a new heroin but hero stays the same

Syrian rogue or isis.why ur ass hurts to say isis.oh secularism

Amazing
I am glad that people are finally realizing that Abhishek Bachan is not a bad actor ...just look how disgusting Varun and Tiger are THEY ARE SPOILED

I didn&#39;t even watch any movies of this list 😎

If these kind of movies Bollywood produces sooner or later director and actor will have no work, real talent need to be appreciated. Laxmi love aaj kal and cookie no 1 like seriously we have movies like Black, Queen,Haider etc where are the script writer gone. Need movie and content like Scam and Asur..

<a href=""> Qureka: Live Trivia Game
One of the best episode. Seriusly ppl r fed up with al this crap. Content rocks

I watched new coolie no1 then i watched orignal coolie no 1 4 Times just to overcome it 😂😂

Good to see maturity of todays indian audience .....they straightforwardly reject shitty movies

Is been years since i watched a fuck karachiwood movie..except ayusman khurana and bahubali

Matlab consent gaya tel lene... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 too damn funny and real u are man... Love your videos...
I am regular viewer of your channel. I like your content &amp; the way you show every aspect of the story is awesome. I would love if you create any segment which covers beautiful regional movies of all languages who missed by the mass.Thank you!

Before watching any movie, watching ur review video to see if it&#39;s worth 😅

If there was any Salman&#39;s movie in 2020 then it would have topped in this list😂😂

Haven&#39;t watched any of these movies! 😂😂

@tried and refused production team. You guys uploaded a video a while ago regarding telugu movie rx100. I can&#39;t find it anymore. Was it deleted? It was one of the videos I wanted to share but I can&#39;t find it anymore.

Laxmmi was a good movie... it was made by the same director who directed, choreographed And acted in Kanchana movie...

I really enjoyed Laxmii Man... that was great

That was, save 100.Thanks

Feeling proud for coolie no.1. Just 5 days taken to be added in this list😂😂

Only if Yami Gautam was a star kid like Sara or a nonclassy actress like Jacqueline...she would have also got the big opportunities...kaabil, Vicky donor, she did amazing job in Bala but Ananya Pandey received the award of best supporting actress for Pati , Patni or woh. Not to mention she is also very beautiful compared to these plastic beauties...

Best 👍😂
About the character of Dilip Hathkata - may have been inspired from a real gangster from Hooghly, Bengal. He was notorious for his brutality.

I made 2 mistakes, either I gave Laxmibomb or I gave Baaghi3.
Thank you so much for doing this video Jammy

It was not right to Put Virgin Bhanupriya as a pure torture...yeh ek film hai jisme Urvashi Rautela was fab....

I watched only Laxmi. Of course 4 Akkiiii.😘

Where is horrible mention? 😂😂😂😂

2021 will be million years for you.Soon to million ❤️❤️

Jammy Please make list of top 10 films of 2020 covering all film industries.

Can you please do a review of Alt  Balaji web series Paurashpur.

@<a href="">8:05</a> Abla bhi hum hai tabla bhi hum hi bajayenge..🤣🤣🤣🤣 wtf
My mom was watching cooling number 1 today my god that shit was cringe to the max. It should be illegal to produce that level of cringe.

I didn&#39;t even watch trailer of these movies 😂 good work 😅😅

Today I watched October of Varun Dhawan. I feel that because we audience did not responded to October the way it deserves, Varun Dhawan is convinced to do movies like coolie. When it comes to serious or dark characters VD is master of that role.

Who like this channels intro music?

2020 and these  people still not understanding men sexual abuse 🤦 using it as a comic relief is just so disturbing

Happy new year to jammy, the best movie reviewer on youtube for INDIAN cinema. Ab tho tamil aur telugu bhi cameo karte hai channel pe. 🔥

where is gunjan saxena?

Title must be &quot;Films which are more dangerous than corona&quot;.

Thank God I did not watch any of these stupid movies..

<b>This list is more dangerous than Babasir!!!</b>
Kusos To Me...I Haven&#39;t Watched Any Of These Movies...I Think I Am Ready To Be A Movie Critic...😂

The one thing that i just don,t understand is how such pathetic gets excepted,just how.i really think bollywood is a cult which doesn,t want to fix the society but just destroy it with movies like these

I&#39;m the only Imtiaz Ali fan who enjoyed Love Aaj Kal

Sara needs to join acting classes A(freaking)SAP!!

I am feeling sorry that I watched Coolie No. 1. And I am happy that I didn’t watch any other movie in this list.

So in prediction thumbnail you showed Himesh&#39;s happy hardy and heer and in conclusion the movie is not there. So is it like you have not seen the movie or you liked it?

I personally don&#39;t think Sadak 2 or love aj kal 2 were painful to watch. they have enough small parts (scenes) to enjoy, while u can ignore the overall story of the movie.

Your ascent is boring

How does bollywood stay afloat with so many crap movies?  And what does that say about the indian audience?

Sara Ali Khan can&#39;t act to save her life. She is a total total washout talent wise. And she gets paid big bucks for that??

I have not seen any new film since jan 2020, we planned to watch Jumanji... that was also utterly disgusting.

Patiently waiting for you to hit 1 million ♥️♥️

You forgot khali peeli
What is your resolution for 2021??Jammy-- Be unapologetic about these fuckall movies...

If u watched COOLIE No.1, don&#39;t worry about what is in the Covid vaccine 👍😭😭😭😭

I have to say that it&#39;s been about 4 yrs since I&#39;ve watched a Bollywood film fully. Maybe I have watched once sometime in those years I cant really remember but I&#39;m glad Ive steered clear from Bollywood nowadays. And I do not regret it.Stupid remixes, stupid films and try-hard actors and actresses, ahem ahem

I did watch Baagi-3 &amp; it was hilarious..I can&#39;t believe the concept of one man vs an entire militia i mean it was utterly impossibly ridiculous..I later watched it online with my friends after we enjoyed some whiskey and we all busted out laughing..over the top ridiculous movie worth the 1 star i gave it..best 1 star movie ever..🤣🤣🤣

Lol Sara Ali Khan literally did 2 movies this year and both are on the list

These movies loudly say that 'TUM CHUTIYE HO' But Indian audiences believe that they are fools :-p
Baaghi 3 was insane cause Tiger Shroff. No arguments. What a lad

I just checked the IMDb reviews of Bhanupriya and OH MY GOD 😂🤣🙏🏻Someone has asked for a sequel 🙈😭🤣

Wow, I’m the only lucky girl who haven’t watched all this crap I guess this is the best thing in 2020 for me😂

Love aaj kal itni buri nhi thiiii

Bach Geya...didn't even see anything...huuu😌😌😌😌
I think director producer and some actors want to keep the guilty pleasure notion alive in the current generation. Sadly that doesn&#39;t exist anymore. Specially if I talk of the 14 to 25 age group. That&#39;s precisely when some of us got our guilty pleasure by watching crass cinema. There is so much content. These movies will be forgotten within few more weeks.

<a href=""> your job wisely. Logical riddle/ puzzle video

And the award goes to Sara Ali Khan for 2 disasters.

Poor Sara Ali Khan. She needs to be really careful going forward if she wants to be taken seriously. We don’t like nepotism, but forgiveness is possible to the individual if they show promise and growth.

Three films scripted by Farhad Samji.

Liking this video even before starting it because of the thumbnail 😂

You missed out Khali Peeli in your list...😂😂😂

And I&#39;m again glad that I didn&#39;t watch any of these movies

Ohh... Thanking myself that i didn&#39;t see any of these movies......🤗

Bhai rasbhari

And these people are face of the mainstream bollywood 🤦🏻‍♂️

You guyzz have to admit, Jammy did the best this year, i mean all his video which came out this year were mindblowing &amp; kept us hooked, he really worked hard this year for his channel &amp; his content. So well done Anmol, &amp; i am sure you will do even better next year. Best of Luck &amp; Happy New Year.

The biggest productions make the worst movies

Laxmi bomb was without a doubt the biggest disappointment because we had sooo much expectations from it

Best of luck for a new beginning guys 👍

yes I also not watched a single movie from this

Hope you cross 1million subscriber in 2021

Love aaj KALBhaagi 3Indu ki jawaniLaxmiSadak 2Coolie no 1 remakeMrs Serial Killer { the only one I watched for Manoj Bajpai }Virgin Bhanupriya

I am not akshay fan ... but for a fact akshay has tried different role in most of his films that appreciate i think

At <a href="">7:08</a> did jammy just say &quot;talented children &quot;...really jammy...

talented actors nice joke

What do you think of R. Madhavan &#39;s next film on Amazon prime MAARA??

Not seen a single salman movie in Theatre in last 5 years after Bajrangi Bhaijaan..before that I saw bodyguard ready jai ho in theatre..and it changed my perspective on cinema 😲😲

Varun may suck but he looks cute as hell as a girl

Brother... I have seen many best movies from your face... thanks from my heart...
Your channel is the reason behind my change of perspective towards looking at films,otherwise from childhood my mind was so stereotypically set to watch this crap films that I started to doubt humanity...😂😂😂

Haven&#39;t watched a single movie out of the list..  people who also haven&#39;t just wanna ask them -Feeling good yet?😉

Your voice sounds like Kartik aryan
More dangerous than covid 😱

I&#39;m so glad that Bollywood making such kind of movies as we don&#39;t have to think much before skipping such movies😂😂😂

I wonder y there wasn&#39;t any pictures of Varun Dhavan without his mouth open.

I am really happy that the star worship decreased this year and people are choosing talent over stardom

As a young movie watching audience, I used to watch a lot of bollywood movies thinking that they are better and more evolved. But ohh God was i wrong. 😒😐During this pandemic I completely shifted my movie choices and went back to watching Malayalam movies even the old Malayalam movies that were released decades before I was born. Watching them again and again made me understand how much ahead the Malayalam movie industry is as compared to bollywood. And I&#39;m sooo glad that I&#39;m a mallu and understand the language very well. THANK GOD FOR THAT 🙂😇

What&#39;s with the obsession with Sara in comment section ? Why&#39;s everyone talking about her specially ?

And I haven't seen these many movies yet, I'm still alive.. proud of me.. I've had a heart attack just 4-5 times.
Let&#39;s make it clear, stars like Jacqueline Fernandez, Katrina Kaif, Urvashi Rautela, Nargis Fakhri etc are clear examples of; All actresses can be good models but all models can&#39;t be good actresses.. they&#39;re just given chance after chance in Hero centric movies initially, be it romantic, comedy, action, this that &amp; when they fetch good box office numbers just by flaunting their glamorous curves, they&#39;re then hired by a list actors &amp; people accept them as very good, award deserving heroines

Hiee... You know I&#39;m soo obsessed with your channel, your content, the hard work that you put in before presenting any of your researched videos. Its you who put in your sweat and blood into evry video that you create. I truly wish that you become even more popular and people actually realize what you want us to understand.

Baaghi 3 deserved the first spot

Enough of informative videos we got .... now when will you upload your dance cover... eagerly waiting for it

I am quite lucky that I avoided these shitty film&#39;s as I watched your review thank you jabby for saving me from these craps❤😁

<b>Just uploaded an year end Podcast❤️</b><b><a href="">

So you had to watch all these movies 😅😅

I thought Mrs serial killer was supposed to be like that ... I like it, so bad it is good.

I&#39;m so shocked to not see Ananya pandey&#39;s movies here!😳

Me: watches worst movies of 2020 video of Anupama Chopra on film companionMe: watches the same video but on tried and refused production

The only reason these people(aka Bollywood Stars) get this much confidence is because people talk/make videos/do analysis about even their flops and cringey movies.

I didn&#39;t watch any of these movies. Even I never heard of name of  indu ki jawani and  bhanupriya.

This was the best years for YouTubers.

In chutiyo se ek dang ka mic tak nhi liya jata bas gyan batte rhte h baski kuch nhi bhai shab paise bhi dediye to ek bhi short film or song banana baski nhi bhot Asaan hota h critics bana actually it’s the most easiest job in the world.Bas duniya ko chutiya bana ata h.

Laxmi was actually a superhero origin movie !

Most of the films are remake or reboot of the older version

Lmao I watched love Aaj kal only to see what lengths they went to make it the worst😂

I can assure you that the only person who watched all of these movies would be jammy😂 P.S- if you too have, sorry you&#39;re a PYSCO!

But where is khali peeli it should be no. 0😄😄😄😄😄😄
Hope you reach 1M in 2021! You deserve it! 😊
Hope 2021 has a better fare for you to review

I literally didn&#39;t watch any one of them🙏😂

Jammy please review RAM PRASAD KE TERVIplease

Varun is Talanted children ??🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just see everyone bashing sara but no one ever bash Shraddha for her terrible acting skills with her boring dialogues delivery..in each crap movie she does the same role again and again...same shit rain bathing and all ...whether  you have seen baghi 3 , baghi, half girlfriend, ok janu , street dancer and most of her movies always male star is bashed but never she is..i don&#39;t understand why no one eyes about Shraddha crap acting skills..

U missed kaali peeli
ek movie bhi nhi dekhi hai bhai ismese kyunki hollywood me itna khoya hua tha martin scorcese,christopher nolan,denis ki movie sirf dekh rha tha

Thank god ! I didn&#39;t  watch any of them.🤣🤣

You just nailed it.

I will put shubh mangal zyada saavdhan also in this list

A gentle reminder to you, I have been ur consistent subscriber ever since u had 300k subs, ur  critical analysis and colousal verbose is exquisite .

<a href="">7:07</a>  &quot;talented children&quot;... Aah? Something seriously wrong with you Jammy.

I regret watching all the movies . The only movie I did  not watch in this list is virgin bhanupriya

Hahahaha

Original Love Aaj Kal was boring (apart from its good music). This one was unbearable. I had to gulp 3 bottles of beer to sit through the entire movie. And not to mention, my dear wife asked me to divorce her if I ruin her valentine day with such movie 😒😒

Who Is Sara Ali Khan?

Durgamati should have top the list

I haven&#39;t seen any of these films yet

love aaj kal is the top one (worst )

I have not seen a single movie from this list😂❤️

The only saving grace about Love Aaj Kal is its soundtrack. Rahogi Meri, Mehrama, Shayad.. etc are hauntingly beautiful.

Thank God 😁 I haven’t seen any of these movies 😂😂😂

Missed Durgamati 😂
Boycott Drugywood😠
I haven&#39;t watched any of these shit. I hope we the Indian audience won&#39;t watch movies like Coolie no1, baaghi once the theaters fully open. Then the producers will know that these dated concepts have lost potential to pull audience to the movie halls. Let&#39;s collectively not watch shitty films and pour our money on good films such as lootcase and ludo..

Kaarthik Aryan is so overrated. He CANNOT act.

Cringey bollywood movies are only good at spreading stereotypical ideas that are specifically included to create controversy, so that the makers can get publicity (negetive publicity is also a publicity).

Love ajj kal would might have done better it with some MORE BETTER actoress...wheres kiara and aditya could have done movie with a better script🙄

Main Love Aaj Kal Dekhne Ke Liye Pagal Sa Tha , Ticket Bhi Book Ki Thi , Lekin Phir Dil Se Aawaj Aai Bhai Film Beshak Imtiyaz Ali Ki Hai Par Sar Dard Mujhe Hi Hoga Aur Maine Ticket Cancel Kar Di , And I&#39;m Still Safe .

Sara ali khan is a disappointment both in movie selection n acting.

Tried &amp; Refused production my vocab bhaiya.....plz gift me a heart for the new year

Talented children&#39;s 😂 are you ok bhai?

Heppy New year

Baaghi 1 is a remake of prabhas&#39;s varsham

I know by trailers wich films r bad. And i havent watched any film of ur list. I feel sorry for u that u had to see them. 😅

Mrs serial killer deserves more respect and should be in number 2 🤔

Totally disagree with u as far as Laxmi and Mrs Serial Killer are concerned. These were good movies. Total crap was coolie no 1.

Top 10 Indian Unicorn Startups of the Last Decade<a href=""> I need your support please like and share this Video and Subscribe to my channel.

Just want to say thank you Jammy, I have learned a lot from you and your channel since I have been following you. Have a great New Years!

Why?? why??😡 I didn&#39;t get it bollywood always copy from south Industry

Happy new year to you all in advance and let us hope that 2021 is going to be better.

For me pati patni aur panga also made in this list.   The performances the thought behind story bad screen play. And extremely painful dialogues. Being a part of lgbtqi community I feel was offenceve and disturbing.

Unpopular opinion: Jahnvi is much better than Sara in terms of acting.

Even i would like to say thank you jammy for saving us from trash movies not only in lockdown bit also way before🙏🙏🙏

Which movie is the first pic from?

Laxmi is best movie

OveractingStereotypingCringe contentIs all bwood left with

Consent gaya thel lene....hahahhahhaaaaahhahaaa

I didn&#39;t even bother watch the video, 😂

Why don&#39;t you review anime series??

I did watch Love Aaj kal, it was ok. Arushi, Kartikk and off course Randeep did very well. These 3 and the music made it watch able, otherwise it was a totally crap movie.

<a href="">8:16</a> And his insta bio is written as IITian🙄🙄🙄...here also I gave a top
I wish you reach 1M in 2021🎉Happy New year ❤️
Good summary thank you! Sadly I have watched some here already, but will stay away from the rest :)Just one more thing. In the background score on your videos, there is always a very subtle &quot;jhing jhing jhing&quot; sound. Is that necessary? It somehow always bothers me :( but anyways, look forward to your content in the next year

I didn&#39;t even know half of these movies existed 😆. I spent this year watching old movies like Silence of the Lambs, Memento, Inglorious Basterds, The Prestige, Taxi Driver, Swades etc😁

It really hurts my heart to see Varun Dhawan, an actor with great potential, being included in such lists because of his bad choices

Tu devmanush hai Jammy bro... 🙏 wish you more success and happiness in 2021🎁

Yar i was hoping for another Matlab Kuch Bhi episode before 2021

rest all is true, but not agreed with laxmi ... i loved the movie.. Great acting by akshay. how he kept transforming himself into feminine character and then back to original was Great !!

A lot of appreciation for Jammy, who cared to watch and review these Mind torturing movies for us. I wish 2021 will be better for him and overall Indian cinema.

People hating Bollywood not only about scripts..Acting..and nepotism...The main reason is Sushanth sing Rajput sir.❤️..Indians will never forget him

dont know why laxmii is here

When i saw coolie no.1 at number 2 i really thought what could be worse than this.

Thanks so much for this video. Thankfully I haven&#39;t watched any of these movies 😂. Because you didn&#39;t recommend any of them previously yeh ☺️. I always seem to watch the ones you actually recommend and have throughly enjoyed alot of them so thank you. I always wonder how you get through watching such horrible content 😮. Although I know that&#39;s part of what you do. I think the problem especially with a movie like your worst pick which looks so bad is that the film makers are living in a different decade with no sensitivity or filter .With regards to actors I do feel that most of them should be aware of how crass the scripts are but I feel in Indian cinema the problem is some people are still compliance to this. Like it&#39;s not a problem but it&#39;s the lack of awareness and around how bad it is. I recently saw a movie called Last Christmas and man was it bad it was so unfunny yet Emilia Clarke is a wonderful actress. She was amazing in Game of thrones and Me before you.  Something which may look good on paper can come out bad due to direction, script and other factors. So I think some actors take decisions and regret it later. I would love to see a video from you around movies or TV shows that deal with important social issues in India or globally please as always interested in films like this. We watched CU soon and it really stayed with us because of the subject matter.

How was khaali peeli not a part of this list?

Unpopular Opinion : LAK2 with similar plot would have been a much better received film if it had better performances, slightly better writing, &amp; better direction from Imtiaz (which we know he&#39;s capable of)It seemed like Imtiaz realized soon after starting the project that he won&#39;t be able to get the results that he wanted &amp; hence gave up midway, continuing with half-assed mediocre direction

Let&#39;s say it how it is, Sara isn&#39;t a good actor.

Please make kuch bhi episode on cooli no. 1 (2020)

You know whats the scariest thing about this video?I got to know they are making Baaghi 4. Oh Dear God.

Now make top 10 best 2020 Indian movie!

Nobody really asks for remakes or do they?

where is khali peeli???

Wow Sara Ali Khan surprised me big time this year. When she started off, I saw a confident girl in her interviews ( or she built that as a disguise) so I expected her to be very talented, but my God. The girl is horrible, cannot act to save her damn life. A clear example of the atrocities of nepotism.

To be honest Baaghi 3 should be in top 3 for worst performances.

Please someone  tell varum that he is not govindha 🙄

You forgot one other similarity. They all were mostly written by &quot;Farhad Samzi&quot;

Being a cinema lover I havent watched any of them except Laxmi, is it me being selective or these films are really that bad

I had a friend who interrupted our chat and said  we will continue later baaghi 3 is starting on TV.  HAD.

I just hate bollywood ...

Where is Kaali Peeli in this list ?

aabla bhi hum hai tabla bhi hum bajayenge wtffff
Sara Ali Khan has done four movies and two of them are on the list 😹😹

Thappad must be added in this list. There is a perfect answer for this movie in soorarai potru.

<a href="">6:11</a> hathkata Dilip was a real life goon of Bengal back in the 90&#39;s

This is next level😂😂😂😂Spider tingling 😂😂😂😂

Hey Jammy!! Hats off to your love for cinema. There are so many great recommendations you have made and those were truly amazing movies!! Keep watching and Keep recommending!!

Happy New Year fellow Humans.

WELL if we keep on watching these movies then god bless india

Indoo ki jawani - torturest

I dont even find Sara Ali Khan pretty. She only has her family going for her.

Still recovering from Laxmi

Gunjan Saxena? Jhanvi&#39;s acting was crap. The movie was crap/sexist/misogynistic. The highlight was punkaj Tripathi

I feel proud for that I didn&#39;t watched any of these movies 😂😂🙏

Keep growing man. We are looking forward for more good and honest content.💗

I can feel proud that I have watched only 1 out Of 8  movie in this list and that is LAK2020 on Netflix..just to check how Imitiaz Ali can down his level of direction..shocked by Karthik and Sara&#39;s dumb performance .. but I have to say...Music Album is by far best of 2020 (my opinion) Shyad,Meherma,Haa main galat,Aur kya..are refreshing.

<b>Badlapur- Child&#39;s Capability</b><b>Coolie no. 1- What Indian Parents force upon child.</b>

<b>Awesome list..... haven&#39;t watched a single movie from this list......</b> 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂

You are one of the best movie reviewerI always look upto your review on movies or any other content

I can forecast almost every movie with bizzare casting Like Varun, Tiger &amp; Selmon bhai that it would be a real cringe, why can&#39;t people 😎

Firstly  Jammy let me wish you a happy new year ...Well all this year showed the worst. Forms of things and Bollywood wasn&#39;t immune to it ... As we saw few such works that is completely bonkers and challenges your intelligence for watching it ... Chalo as we move to New year hope we will see work that would make it worth to out time and money in movie .

Overrated actors of 2020 - Varun - Street Dancer &amp; Coolie No. 1Sara - Love Aaj Kal 2 &amp; Coolie No. 1Kiara - Laxmmi &amp; Indoo Ki JawaniSwara - Rashbhari, Flesh, Bhaag Beanie....Trash is an understatement.

Without srk salman aamir ajay akshay, Bollywood sucks.
Cleansing year for Hindi cinema... No bad films made 100 cr... It would have been heartbreaking to watch coolie no1 or laxmi making moolah despite bad reviews

Worst of 2020 - Sadak 2Love Aaj Kal 2Baaghi 3Coolie No. 1LaxmiiVirgin BhanupriyaStreet Dancer 3DMrs. Serial Killer Indoo Ki JawaniKhaali PeeliJai Mummy DiHackedBhoot - Part One DurgamatiShakeela

Frankly speaking even in commercial cinema actresses can give decent performances, eg aishwarya in dhoom 2, kareena in golmal n bodyguard,deepika in Chennai express. But SARA just CANNOT act , she really needs to work in her skills

Watching Sara Ali Khan is pure torture. How come she became actress with this acting ability and this looks🙄

Can you also include the same good and bad films list that you watched in other languages.

Where is khali peeliI am missing it in this list 😂😂

Best channels of 2020:yogi babaAnd this

Me to Sara's acting: 'Tum mujhe tang krne lge ho.....'
Virgin Bhanupriya has such a high rating in IMDB! Don&#39;t understand how people can like it!😑

When did mrs.serial killer released and even manoj sir acted in that🤯🤯🤯

On what basis people approve n fund these type of cheap movie, Do they think : whatever we make Indians will watch??

That Wahh after Dilip Hathkata was hilarious 😂😂😂😂

Fortunately I haven&#39;t watched any of these because you took the risk and told us not to watch it. XDHappy new year everyone :)

Now that you have done video about best and worst movies 2020 can you make a video about series also?

Glad to see audience is getting over these big budget, overhyped starkids cast and all the mirch masala in the name of senseless content and appreciating actually good content. Still we, as an audience has a long way to go. We need more reviewers like him.

Netflix gave them a platform or they gave them a prize.
Unfortunately I have watched one of those. Bhaaghi 3. That was total time waste.

Hats off to you for watching these shit and  reviewing it for us. But seriously I found it funny when almost each and every reviewers give example of Badlapur/October/Kedranth as if these are Oscar  nominated movies.

What we need is for Bollywood to start over again, all dynasty families should leave and let real talent emerge

Love aaj kal had the potential to be a good movie but then Sara just killed every chance of the movie being rewatchable,imitaaz has had bad casting choices in the past like nargis in Rockstar but a heavyweight like ranbir saved it but here Karthik couldn&#39;t.

Thank god i never watched sm of this films Love Aaj kal nd laxmi fast forward krke dekhi😭Baghi3 theatre me dekhi

Laxmi is definitely worst movie of this decade

Wait what?! <b>Baaghi 4</b> 😲Are they mad?🤷For me baaghi 3 is the no one disaster of 2020, &quot;Corona be proud becoz you are much much better than these ****&quot; 😠😠

And I haven&#39;t seen any of these

About the dialogues in bhanupriya, one of us author (very well known) in one of her novel wrote about main lead seducing and having intercourse with the hero of the novel while he was passed out drunken . And when he finally woke up, he asked if the situation was reversed he would have been called rapist. The writer faced lots of backlash because of the fact that this woman literally raped the guy and they still end of together i.e trying to normalise non consensual sex because it was a guy. And this was in 90s. How the hell did this dialogue even got approved. They should not only receive bad reviews but a legal action against the writer, producer and literary the whole cast to normalise Rape word. Whether girl or boy. Dialogue like this make guys afraid to speak out as our society always associate rape with women. Aur ladke ke Saath hua toh joke.. Disgraceful

One of the saying : Nainital Krrish

this video will get more views than the one with best performances

Regional cinema is there for true cinema lovers..Bollywood is for fans of masala, nonsense films..only 10-20% Bollywood films are actual genuine and watchable 👍

This channal gives desi oscar to bollywood people

thank you jammy for recommending taish.:)

I don&#39;t agree with your statement that Sara is a talented actress. From what we have seen so far, she can&#39;t even be called an actresse. Maybe she may become an adequate actress in future if she acts in supporting roles etc.

You made very good point about how we have changed once we return to normalcy.

And meanwhile Sara Ali Khan also said in some interview that she wants to do &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; remake. If audience think Coolie No.1 was problematic then you guys haven&#39;t watched Biwi No.1. Oh god I still remember that movie.

Glad that no movie of SONAM and ARJUN released in 2020 warna wohi top 2 hota 😁

Sara was just pathetic ... patheeeticcccc

Well I really liked that Pankaj sir has been in so many movies this year and I really loved Abhisek sir&#39;s performance in Breathe and ludo❤️❤️

Dislikers are actors &amp; actress family members 😂

You forgot khali peeli and durgamati...what a terrible acting varun,tiger ,ananya and sara has done this year 😒...I did not expected akshay sir doing plain terrific acting in Laxmi 🙄 Bollywood should get their original scripts enough of remakes that are banging my head 🙁... coolie no.1 was pathetic 🤮

Sara can&#39;t act.
Lakshmi was so loud and annoying that i watched it on mute and still heard some noices

Want to say thank you for burning your eyes for us. 😊

2 mins ago i was watching coolie number 1

Sara Ali Khan started with crap movie Love Aaj Kal at the beginning of the 2020 and ends with another crap movie Coolie No. 1 at the end of 2020!

Struggling to get laid😂😂😂...lollolololololol....dude I started laughing on top of my lungs😆

Bollywood audience has finally taken a huge leap. They chose content over stardom in 2020. Plus, your channel has been a great leveler. It has come up with unbiased content, even when many film Youtubers had turned toxic and hate mongers. Good luck for 2021. Looking forth to more amazing content.

Not gonna lie LOVE AAJ KAL 2020 (was social media destoryed)It was a good film and god the randeep hooda story was 🥺Sorry, you all live on the stereotypes.

@Tried&amp;Refused Productions.  Can you please acknowledge the first Meta movie of India is not Ak vs Ak as many people claiming, there is a Bengali Meta movie by the great Mrinal Sen named &#39;Interview&#39;(1970) which was released maybe before Ak vs Ak&#39;s director was even born! I hope Indians would acknowledge old Indian Bengali films as Indian. Bdw, &#39;Interview&#39; is on the youtube channel Echo Films, but it does not have subtitles. You can watch it searching &#39;interview by mrinal sen&#39;. I hope people atleast check, atleast the movie reviewers.

You forgot Durgamati 🤔
Sara Khan seems like a pretty likable person but she is an awful actress and she shows no potential either. Which is a shame because a lot of other talented actresses (who are probably also likable) will never get the opportunities she gets.

Looks like varun dhawan wants to replicate govinda&#39;s career.

Last bollywood I have watched is mission Mangal in theater.After that I haven&#39;t seen a single bollywood movie neither in ott platform or in any other means.

I am happy that  i just scored 1/8 here

worst thing is majority of them are a product of nepotism.

Please react on Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham movie trailer

Never have I ever : watched a single movie from this list.

The background music is soo sleepy

I think Durgamati starring Bhumi Pednekar (remake of Bhaagamathie)I have not seen the original film but still I could say that the original was much better than the remakeBhumi&#39;s acting and her performance in the film was not on point (definitely not in this film)

Things you can&#39;t explain to die hard fans of following actors because their fans have this one reason every time you argue:Selmon Bhoi: &quot;Bhai kitna donation karte hain&quot;Tiger Shroff&quot; &quot;Uske jaisa stunt koi nahi kar sakta&quot;Varun Dhawan: &quot; Go and watch badlapur &quot;Sara Ali Khan: &quot;She was decent in Kedarnath&quot;Arjun Kapoor   .................................................

Kaali pelli?
Brother, if you reach one million subscribers, I&#39;ll eat pigs.
Love Aaj kal is testament that how much protagonist is important to the movie. I feel story was great, Hooda, arushi and kartik were great but the only prblm was Sara. I don&#39;t know why she chose to act like that. If she just acted nrmly. She has to carry this movie but sadly she was the weaker perfomer out of all.For coolie no 1 i saw a comment on twitter. Jb log October ko flop, Badlapur ko avg grosser aur Judwa 2 ko 200 cr krwayenge to bnda Coolie No 1 hi krega.In the end sb dhndha h producer ko ghnta farak nhi pdta aur cheezo se. Us bnde ko to paise recover to krne h

This year most of the bollywood movies fought for imdb 1.1 ratings.. But sadak is winner .. Coolie no. 1 is runner . 😃

Mahesh Bhatt&#39;s skills have really gone down. It&#39;s time for him to retire.

sara ali khan giving a tough run for jaqueline fernandes  to become the shittiest actress of the country

Anmol bhai ko 21 topo ki Salaami dene ka mann karta hai, bhai hame un movies k reviews de deta ho bina mentally unstable hue, agar hum unki jagah hote to shayad abhi tak pagal ho chuke hote ya fir laptop ya phone break kar chuke hote. Hats off to you brother 🙏🙏🙏👍

Ur criticisms are far soothing than watching these movies

Bhagi 4 coming

Idk how to say this but ,&#39;Thank you Jammy&#39; for paving a way to differentiate cinema for us, I love how you just spit facts without any bias and before watching your reviews/recommendations I was never able to process a movie or media as a whole from my perspective the way I am able to today , after being a subscriber for more than one and half year now I truly have evolved in the sense of my taste and have seen you too go through it , whether it be apologizing later for 1st reactions on above average movies or watching the whole thing twice to understand and then put your views, you really have been consuming content as a movie buff and a reviewer even going to lengths to watching crass movies/scenes just to make us realize that it hasn&#39;t aged well in the form of the monthly &#39;Matlab Kuch Bhi&#39; segments .I really am grateful to you Anmol , yeah even for the fluent English communication skills too, JK 😂

Back in 2018 I thought Sara would be more responsible than Jahnvi when it will come to movie choices, but........

Its funny that Sara Ali khan did 2 movies this year and both are in the list..

I regret watching baghi3

Youtubers like him give me faith

Wow I&#39;m early

I haven&#39;t watch any of these films.And after seeing this i won&#39;t be watching any of these.

Sara is overrated and overhyped, overacting ki dukan!! I don&#39;t knw why people are crazy for her, yes she looks good, but there are many out there who look good!! For what she has 30M followers on instagram?? She is choosing only masala roles opposite big actors just to get more popular and get a hit!! Actually I find that people hate janhvi so much unnecessarily, She is a better actress than Sara, she is choosing content rather than masala films, women centric movies just to prove herself!! I used to love Sara, but now i hate her due to her majot pr skills...

I didn&#39;t see a single movie in this list

I hate sara&#39;s acting if what she does  is consider acting And she made the list twiceLove it

Collie no 1 should be no 1 worst. It&#39;s brother of corona

When no.7 is BAAGHI 3You know there is a lot of shit produced this year

My favorite critcs of all time ... ❤️

I haven&#39;t watched any of these 😎

I thank to god that i didn&#39;t watch any of this single <a href="">crap.So</a>,lucky i&#39;m.Jaamy your a great critic n this is a part of your job to analys n explain of a good n bad part but this movies r so bad and a waste of time to <a href="">watch.Love</a> your voice n the way you explain.keep it up.

Keep up the good work Jammy you deserve more subs👍

I&#39;ve much reverence for varun,tiger salman for reassuring me to not watch their products

Coolie No 1 Deserve First place..
I prefer Mrs.Serial Killer over Laxmi Bomb anyday

Anmol Bhai, Have you watched the Hollywood movie &#39;Primer&#39;?

My favourite words in this video: &quot;socially irresponsible&quot;.Kudos, Jammy!

Man u should have kept sadak 2 in number1

Sara Ali Khan more like Remake Wali Gha*d.. 👎
Sara was amazing in Kedarnath for me and I think it’s maybe because ppl guided her properly ... and the audience did not expect anything from her ... but in love Aajkal we understood how bad her acting skills are and even in Simba , the two seconds she acted was something I didn’t like but guess what she is still going to get movies !!

Bro you missed Durgamati.

Dolly kitty aur woh chamkate sitaare should also be here bakwaas se bhi bakwaas thi maine trailer dekh kar das baar aankh dhoi thi himmat nhi hui dekhne ki

Me, who doesn&#39;t even watch movies: 👁️👄👁️
sometimes i feel bad for you, what u have to go through just for saving us from these kind of trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Indeed, all the OTT crap turned homes into torture chambers this year apart from the pall of Covid terror.

Sara Ali Khan is worst actor she should quit Bollywood

Dam!  I didn&#39;t even see one ..like shwetabh bhai said...itni zabardast acting.. story wale content dekho ki tatti movies hajam he naho..😂

you made our year fun, jammy.

2020 : a year that bollywood wanna erase😀

Where bhumi in dolly kitty, Durgavati

Honorable mentions: khali peeliHit like if you agree

Sara is more annoying than Ananya, Janvi and all other combined together

Hey I&#39;ve been following you from 2015 and loved you from the start . It makes me so happy that you&#39;re getting the love and recognition you deserve. Lots of love and best of luck for your upcoming projects ❤️

Bhai where is khali peeli

Mrs. Serial Killer should top this list!! Can&#39;t imagine anything being as bad ...

Can&#39;t decide if this year was a tragedy or a comedy.

Hope you have watched Harsh beniwals newest video....Best content of his channel

happy new year jammy mate......

Baaghi 4 is loading steadfastly somewhere in the corner....

Thank you for the videos this year Jammy!Just remember one thing when doing your work; &quot;PAISA!&quot;That&#39;s why people sign films, that&#39;s why makers make those films, and that is how the launder money (claiming their film cost X, they lost Y to hide that they have $)

Please sara quit acting......on a serious note do something else ur intelligent do smthing eles not acting  plzz🙏🙏

Super like! Yes these are shits on the screen. I too share same views with you. I was fortunate enough that I&#39;m not a film critic so I enjoy the luxury to give a miss to such trash content which is visible through their trailers.

all the memers are sold out I hope you will continue with this kind of content of honest review ...

Great work man...Urvashi rautela and sara ali khan are such pathetic actors.....

I didn't see even one😇
Baggi 3 is more of entertaining than any other movie on this  list. Better than durgamati.

These are the films which I did not watched till now, and there are some more which I watched (half/full) and found totally bakwaas like LUDO, Bulbul, Durgavathi, Serious Man, Choked.....

Title should be some handful good Bollywood movies rest r shit

Well, well, well. Covid isn&#39;t the only thing we had to survive this year. A damned year overall.

imagine if kangana ranaut or taapsee pannu did mrs. serial killer? would&#39;ve been a blockbuster indeed. Also, sara ali khan, please quit acting rn, ur not talented. Losing weight doesn&#39;t mean u become an actor, u actually need to know how to act.  If I have to hear  &quot;tum mujhe tang karne lage ho&quot; another second, i swear i&#39;m gonna vomit

Absolutely Right what you trying to say in Video.... As per me Coolie No 1 &amp; Baagi 3 is most worst film which I have ever seen. It is better to watch any bhojpuri film instead of this two films.

What about Jahnvi Kapoor?

Sara is just baking a lot.
I really had hopes from Sara Ali khan but.......

I wish Sara Khan had joined Rohit Shetty's hand in front of her.
It&#39;s high time that we should stop watching every crap serve by Bollywood!They should learn that masses are evolved and we don&#39;t buy the same shit anymore!

Please Review The Missing Stone (Mx player)

The spoiler of Coolie no:1 was given by my friend, it will not be fun 😝
Before even the video started i already hit the like button.. Just for the title 😂

so this guy acts like such a feminist and find consent issues in almost all movies but was openly supporting the witchhunt of rhea ! kamaal hypocrite , jo zor zor se bolta haina main hu feminist main hu anti fascist , woh kud sbse bdda sexist aur fascist hota hai .

i want coolie no 1 as  number 1 in this list

They tried ruin Christmas man

This list is incomplete without varun Dhawan n alia bhatt😆

South Indian movies are the best .do you agree

Am glad that i haven&#39;t watched a single movie from this list😌😌

As if Covid wasn&#39;t torture enough.

Iss sal ka aakhri video... wonderful... Happy New year  Jammypants4....

seriously this all big show need to go good drama school or do some stage show  in drama company

I am pleased that I watched none of them..

Virgin Bhanupriya ke spot pe Khaali Peeli daalna ttha...the name exactly states the future of bollyweed.... colourful but nothing inside.... Virgin Bhanupriya had such dialogues par woh typical hai for a girl like her jo Kisi ki attention me aate hi nahi....No one talks ill about her jaise Indoo ke baare me bolat hai...aakhirkar kismat me jo likha wahi hua.... kamre ke light kabhi off nahi hoga...par usse bhi pehle woh apne trip pe gaye tthe enjoy karne which is a good thing... because climax ke baad such a life or experience was never gonna happen Gautam Gulati being such a normal guy like her....Bas baahar se itna dikhta hai but she completely changed him...To yes in place of Virgin Bhanupriya Khali Peeli was the acer in this list....Baaki films ke Comments pe maine pehle bhi likha hai toh phir na likhunga chaahe hai Love Aaj kal ki ho, Laxxshmi ki ho , Cookie number1 ki ho ya Indoo ki jawaani....such crap..🙄

Indoo ki jawaani was a less Crap version of Virgin Bhanupriya....which is why I liked the movie Starring Urvashi Rautela who was really experimented well in the movie with her looks....She killed it...it&#39;s a relatable story anyhow...

<a href="">4:37</a> krish was from nainital btw

That last dialogue is a sad reality of today and I thing its a  good realize karwane k liye janta ko

Covid was actually a boon here. Varna log theater jaana hi chhod dete.  😂

&quot;Khali peeli&quot; another legendary film from 2020.😎😎

Good thing happened in 2020 is I get married n happily continue my professional career... N one more good thing happened is I subscribed to your channel

I saw love aaj kal only bcz of karthik aryan😬

You fools still watch Bollywood movies it shows u r iq n yeah Bollywood equal 10 family 100 family member earn by doing nonsense on screen n u have them millions u r hard eaen money u idiots Bollywood never understand trap👍

We love you jammy happy 2021 never stopped believing in you since 2017 been a regular here since the beginning!!! Thank you for showing your love for south Indian movies and other genres....you just gave me a bigger reason to love my south Indian roots even more!!! Never knew the gems hidden in the south until your channel happened cuz it was so overshadowed by Bollywood crap!!! Thank you so muchh!!!

Where is khali peeli ????

I have not seen any of this crap and I am proud of that.

Within 5 seconds I gave you like because of thanking.... Well. Happy 2021  to you and everyone who is reading :)

Akshay kumar&#39;s acting skill is degrading or may i say he knows people are gonna watch him anyways so he has stopped even trying to act

torbaaz should be in this list too

I believe Varun and Alia are using their respective stardom to provide some financial security and stability to their families. Hence, the poor choice of scripts as both their parents are respectively out of touch with the current scenario with regard to the revolutionary change that audiences&#39; tastes have undergone.

Hey jammy check yours truly of neeraj kabi and shefali shah on Netflix. You will like it

What I felt bad was that : Jammy....how could you forget Street Dancer 3D???🥲 wasn’t it good enough to test the ability of our poor audience 🥲🥲 in my opinion, Street Dancer was much worse than Love Aj kal ....it required an honourable mention...

Jammy we r thankful for ur hard work reviewing all the best n worst movies for us.  We will be waiting for ur reviews for 2021 movies n shows too.

PPL would rate WW84 1/10 BUT THEN THE SAME PPL RATE  baaghi 3 3/10 or any other bullcrap movie a okay rating. Basically  some  have become a bit biased

Baaghi 1 is remake of telugu movie VARSHAM just one fight scene is from raid redemption not the entire movie

kiara z totally overhyped

I was really impressed with sara after seeing Kedarnath. I really thought her debut was good. But, that&#39;s not what I think now. She does mediocre level acting. She just plays roles which are like herself in real life like Sonam Kapoor. After she did two straight remakes which were deplorable, I can&#39;t even imagine the amount of hate she will get in the future and how her career will turn out to be!

SSR was the most deserving actor of this decade

Jamm&#39;s  put a list of good films and series that is a must watch that you hadn&#39;t reviewed in the channel

In advance happy new year jammy.I want to suggest you one Bengali movie and one Bengali webseries. Trust me you&#39;ll love them. The movie is&#39;Dracula sir&#39; and the webseries is &#39; Taqdeer&#39;. Please watch them bro trust me you&#39;ll love it.

If not for corona , radhe and bachan pandey  would have made it to this list

Baki sab toh theek hai but how this channel is so underrated is beyond me! Like legit

Sara is the most overrated. Her acting is horrible but she is getting huge budget movies like atrangi re. She don&#39;t deserve this. 🙄

Basically all the &quot; tang karne wali &quot; performances 😂😂😆😆<b>enters sara&#39;s tum mujhe tang karne lage ho face</b>

I really loved Sara Ali Khan. The way she presented herself and she sounded intelligent during interviews. She might be good human being. I am sorry to say but good actor?? BIG NO. I know she is not experienced but if she wants to make an impact on film industry she needs acting classes. Hope she will choose good roles rather than just dancing in the film and take acting classes. Best of luck for upcoming movies.

Coolie no 1 roast and varun dhawan

We want the best movies of 2020 list

Make a vdo on Ram prasad ki tehrvi

Please review criminal justice season 2

I actually thought Laxmi Bomb Akshay Kumar 1 was better than the Tamil 1 I mean in the Tamil 1 the acting was soo over the top of everyone but in the Bollywood 1 it was well balanced especially Akshay nailed his character

I really wish Varun Dhawan would work in a good movie and show his capabilities like he did in Badlapur instead of working in David Dhawan&#39;s movies. It&#39;s really saddening to say but  his dad&#39;s movies will sink his career if he continues to choose them.

When even tiktok stars can act better than a star kid.

The problem with today&#39;s movie are the audience itself. Many movies which are supposed to be great never performs good in box office. This encourages movie makers and actors not to take risks and make complicated, character defining etc... Because at the end of the day people need money to make movies and except in return at least some...

Only Desi must have got a lot of content for the future from this year alone. 😂😂😂

i am here to see reviews well as  learn english so that i can save my time from these creepy movies. thankyou for the amazing reviews

Nurse Kareena has made it to the thumbnail 😂😆😆

And When someone like Sushant Singh Rajput Rises, on his OWN, then the Nepotism and Bollywood Mafia Kills them :(....... These Starkids are Good for Nothing.... Literally, they aren&#39;t...

I&#39;m just here to Abhishek Bachchan

8- LOVE AAJ KAL.7- BAAGHI 3.6- INDOO KI JAWANI.5- MRS. SERIAL KILLER.4- LAXMII.3- SADAK 2.2- COOLIE NO.1.1- VIRGIN BHANUPRIYA.==&gt;THANK ME LATER.! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Grateful to have you jammy!!

Will you also make one with the Web Series of 2020 as well?

Jammy, your content is literally getting better with each video. I binge-watched your videos during the lockdown. One million subscribers in 2021 for sure. Happy New Year :)

Basically a whole lot of viruses from Bollywood this year.

Baaghi 4 .... someone&#39;s gonna get kidnapped....this time what....in space?

Liked without even watching !

Baaghi is remake of telugu movie Varsham

Kudos to u for having the guts to sit through all these movies..As for me ,this year I didn&#39;t watch a single 2020 Bollywood release..

Love aaj kal wasn&#39;t perfect but certainly wasn&#39;t horrible as well. Kartik was really good and Sara did an average job.

Laxxmi if the name means &quot;Bomb&quot; Didn't even move but still remained silent.
“Sara Ali khan” is big disappointment for me..I expected much more from her 😏

ONE OF THE BEST CRITICS......... INSHALLAH YOU WILL HIT A 1MILLION

I still liked &#39;Love Aaj Kal 2&#39; as a story, the theme was apt.

So I learn a new word from your video &#39;plethora&#39;

Please make a list of mediocres as well just for time pass.

Thanks to this channel we were able to navigate our way around all the trash. 😂

U should get an award for outstanding patience and tolerance cz i left these movie after max 30 min they are horrible.

I think varun dhawan should try some kind of serious role or crime thriller genre .

Jammi bhai.. thanks for keeping us engaged. And entertained throughout the year.. Happy New Year

<a href="">1:39</a> She looks like she sharted. 😂😂😂

Ur accent is too gud but ur explanation looks like in one flowwww learn aomething from zetc critics how they explain the things sir ek hi jaisa bolne lagte ho kahi rukne ka naaam nhi yaar aisa bolo ki majaaa jay

I feel like you guys are giving more points to mrs serial killer it is wayyyyyyyyyy worse than sadak 2 and laxmii.

Happy New year 🔊🔊🔊🔊
Even baaghi part 1 is remake of telugu movie varsham

I feel proud that I chose not to watch a single movie from this list😂

Shimla mirch staring rajkumar rao hema malini n rakul preet was painful  as hell

Bro all the best for the 1 million subs👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 love from tamil nadu 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
I thought Baaghi 3 would be in 1st place .

Race 3 was so bad it should&#39;ve been on this year&#39;s list also.

Humshakals' record will be broken today Sara.
🙏🙏

Please can you make a video on list of best and worst web series . After all this year was the year of web series.

To be honest I liked love aajkal

<a href="">5:24</a> many viewers pausing it to take a breath😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LMAO😂😂

Happy new year in advance bro

You should have included Breathe : Into the Shadows in the list of best performances this year.  Abhishek nailed it.

I have a feeling Sara will soon say goodbye to her brand new career if she doesn’t quickly choose her movies wisely. I have yet to see impressive work from her.

I think that they honestly made such crap to help people forget about covid

If it was a male saying the rape lineThen popatlal dhaari people would have arrived and said &quot;cancel cancel cancel&quot;

Bollywood Remakes bombing now prove the old saying &quot;Nakal karne me bhi akal lagti hai&quot;

Now I still don't have fun ever again.
Khali peeli and durgamati also were bombs in my opinion, What your take Jammy

I realised Akshay Kumar in saree looks like my Bua wtf 😂
Varunardo and Sara both successfully incepted insanity in our minds.

Imtiaz Ali, David Dhawan, Raghava Lawrence, Mahesh Bhatt destroyed their own films. Maybe it&#39;s because the audience has evolved but these guys don&#39;t want to. You can&#39;t stay in the 90&#39;s or 2000&#39;s and think your film will work.

Jammy you&#39;re the best 🤩🎉Waiting for your strike on a million subscribers 🙌💥You truly deserve it 🤙🔥

Why the hell are Khaali Peeli and Rasbhari not here in this list?

Jammy bhai thanks to you too for showing us good reviews without any poems or sayaris and other nautanki

I have never seen any movie in this list

Laxxmi was saved from bombing by Sharad Kelkar. The only good thing about it.

OTT content was very mediocre this year ! A very forgettable year to say the least .

Baaghi was a remake of Varsham (2004), not The Raid Redemption

Urvashi can’t act tbh
Baaghi 4 : Tiger shroff fighting with COVID 19to save the actress from dying in the movie.Or may even find a vaccine himself

Love Aaj kal was painful. Sara n Kartik are mediocre actors.

Par Jammy...Mat lab kuch bhi episode kidar hey 🥺🥺
Thanks to Varun,  Tiger,  Janvhi,  Sara, Sonam,  etc,  we realized the value of Abhishek as an actor.

Speaking of Sirish Kunder, Who dared to watch Tees Maar Khan in theaters. 😱😱😭😭

Alia and Varun should stay away from their respective fathers&#39; movies.

U forgotten Torbaz
Jammy when will your next dance collab come, waiting for it.

Pls make a review on perfect blue

Saved from all these disasters...

Thanks to your reviews, I have not watched any of these movies...👍👍👍

to be really really really honest, Sara’s acting sucks!

Just wanted to sayThank you for sitting through the shit pile of pathetic movies and filtering out the better ones for us to watchTruly grateful

But u see brother....there are some deshdrohis who still watch such crap and fill the pocket of these idiotic producers and actors so that they can come up with more such idiotic content....SHAME ON SUCH AUDIENCE....Boycott bollywoodWho all want a surgical strike on bollywood..??..let me know by pressing the like button

Looks like Sara will break her father's Humshakals record.
True

Dude...I&#39;ve literally not seen a single hindi movie in 2020 lol

So jammy, will you give me a like then?

Durgavati should also be here.One of the rarest movies where comedy scenes are horrific and horror scenes are comedic

I didn&#39;t find anything unique in sadak 2&#39;s music either.

I was really excited for Laxmii Bomb and Radhe at the start of the year though I am the fan of SRK.But Laxmii disappointed me completely except the last 20 minutes of the film.I am waiting for Radhe to release and want it to be super duper action film. Just expecting a good story and not like dabangg 3.Peace.

I was just waiting for this

Haven't seen a single one of these...😇
<a href="">08:05</a> abla ka tabla, man- farhad samji on the roxxx man!!!!!

<b>Mass is crass</b> can be ignored for this period of Lockdown! Take it easy,Jammy..

I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY FOR A VIDEO!!! Sorry, I&#39;m not screaming. I&#39;m just hyped. :D

1 million in 2021!

It seems Sara is hell bent on breaking her father&#39;s record of making the worst film ever - Humshakals.

Bollywood: sorry bhaiya these movies are from my industry, God has taken them out.....
Thanks to your reviews.... I didn&#39;t watch a single one of these...😁

You have saved me from so many disastrous movies. I can&#39;t thank you enough for your sacrifice. I mean watching Coolie No.1? Sympathies. Here&#39;s wishing to a year with less crass cinema. Happy New Year!

I think he likes saying the word &quot;Plethora&quot;...😂😂😂

I got bhagi 3 ad (hotstar one)

Everyone to 2020 - Ab tum mujhe tang karne lage ho!

I haven&#39;t watched single of these 🙃

Of course coolie no 1 is a worst movie ever🤮
Dad:Padh rahe hoMe: YesDad:Kya Padh Rahe HoMe: Youtube pr Comment🤣😂I need all my brothers and sisters support..

Sara Ali Khan want to know your location 🤣🤣🤣🤣

M proud I hv not watched even single one from this list 😁😁

I think you missed khaali peeli🤣

Randeep hooda was the only saving grace in love aajkal

Basically,  Bollywood delivered a whole lot of mutated strains of Covid this year to further torture people.

Jammy plz review DARK A GERMAN WEB SERIES PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ 😌
Varun is an actor with  limited range...He is mediocre at best..nothing special...

Thanks Janmy for making us choose what to watch and what to avoid in an year when we have multiple choices. Updates from this channel has been the most awaited ones in this year from me to be able to rightly choose my entertainment options.

When Jammy started speaking about Indoo ki Jawaani, I knew that No. 1 spot will be taken by Virgin BhaanuPriya... I am sorry Jammy that you have to go through these shitty movies..

Come on JammyTUM MUJHE TANG KARNE LAGE HO is a line I use as a meme almost everyday 😂😂😂

Let’s be real 2020 wasn’t the best year for movies in Bollywood

LAST VIDEO OF THE YEAR! Have a great 2021! May you be such a star that we ask for your autograph one day 😂

When are you making video on the upcoming movies like you did last year

Seriously, Jammy is Aditya seal 🤯
One of the good things 2020 did was that it taught us the value of Abhishek.

Not reviewing Paurashpur ? I was waiting for you to bash it. 😅

The best critic...

Love came today in 2020.
Bhai review Aaranya Kaandam
make video for webseries

I think the masses should start watching good movies rather than boycotting films only that would make our industry better

Sara ali khan :best example of massive privelege with no talent. She will still keep getting all big films. And 5-6 films she will give an hit and people will go ga ga again. It&#39;s a Sham!

What if :Ayushman KhuranaRaj Kumar RaoAnd some famous YouTubers Starred in a  parody action movie franchise that parodiesBaaghi franchise and Race 3type of movies

Sara Ali Khan&#39;s both films made it to the list.Ivy league must be proud 😂😂😂

Please do a review Paurashpur..... I really want to know what are your thoughts on that

I'm not crazy anymore
I&#39;m happy that I have not watched most of the movies.

You are the best🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😊😊😘😘😘
Sara Ali Khan is not an actress

Who else thinks sara ali Khan wants to destroy he ownr career, I mean just look at her movie choices.

U do a good job.. Keep it up
Come on everyone, for the work Jammy has done he deserves a Million mark by now.

I am fist...to comment

i laughed hard when he said they made manoj bajpayee overact

Never been this early 😊

Demand complete... Thanks Jammy

We love you Jammy 💕Just keep making the same content 🌸

Baaghi 4 will definitely be in space &amp; Tiger will fight with Aliens 👽

Well 2020 exposed the fact that Sara Ali Khan is just bahut sara PR.

First dislike
Review paurashpur the worst ott show ever🤮🤮
Varun Dhawan and tiger Shroff being successful in  today&#39;s time scares me.

Abla bhi hm hai tabla bhi hm bajayenge 😜🔥
I left my favourite episode of the office to be here. I think I deserve a like jammy 🙏

Wow!! so fast but don&#39;t know what to comment to get likes 😂😉😜

Imtiaz ali: I ruined my own masterpiece in new Love aajkal!..David Dhawan: First time?

Varun dhawan in 2020 = Street dancer and Coolie No 1!!!Sara in 2020 = love aaj kal and Coolie no!!!
Love Aaj Kal could of worked if you got good actors and for Bhaagi 4 who’s going to be kidnapped next himself, the kidnapper or Russell Coight

To be ownest Sara Ali khan is one of the most disastrous actresses in Bollywood currently..I donno why we even call her an &quot; actress &quot;🤷🏻‍♂️

I just can&#39;t stop clicking on a TRP notification! Absolutely love your content man❤️

Jammy bro as a better script and direction for his videos than these movies 🔥 😂😂

The thing about love Aaj kal that I liked was the past story. That story hit me in the right spot. Unfortunately the present story was miserable.

Check out my Music Channel guys!!

all these performances &amp; movies deserve a padma bhosad smh 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Glad that ihavnt watched any of these shity movies😁👍

Anmmoooollllll thannnkkk yooouuuuuu for entertaining us with great content 😍

Jammi please i have a request.Please watch and review pakistani movie &quot;bol&quot;. it&#39;s available on youtube.Please it&#39;s a request from a pakistani fan🇵🇰🤝🇮🇳

Can someone tell Sara to stop acting😒

bollywood should compete for oscars. That&#39;s how they&#39;ll get better.Btw most indian action movies are superhero movies.And Really? Kiara is struggling to get laid? That&#39;s more unrealistic than baaghi 3.

All these don&#39;t even deserved to be called as movies😑😑

Varun&#39;s Coolie No. 1 was a remake of the 1995 film which was a remake of a 1991 film. Remake within a remake. There you have the Indian Inception. Why blame Varunardo?

Any movie suggestion that i should watch this weekend , pls help a friend out

I have just started watching the video but I am sure Coolie &#39;no 1&#39; would be no 1.

I agree with all your opinions!!!

Love aajkal could have been better, if sara was not in it.

No ,Thank you Boii

Make video on upcoming musical thrillers,horror

Varunardo DiCaprio
Akshay Kumar&#39;s acting in Laxxmi was plain terrible. Very disappointing.

Please review paurashpur, alert balaji web series

I had to click on this video immediately!

Varun DiCaprio just stole the whole limelight👌👌... Kudos to him
