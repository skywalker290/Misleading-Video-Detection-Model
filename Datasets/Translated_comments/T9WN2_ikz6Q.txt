I really am unable to show my love to my father but there&#39;s never been a second in my life tha I wish to just go hug him soo tightly saying all the things and emotions I have for him thanking him for all the demands I made how he handled my sensitive nature Every day I wish I can just say that I love you my dear father I know I can&#39;t do anything to repay for what you have done for me how much you have sacrificed for me how hard you work for me But everytime I see you smile and proud by so small things that I do then that makes me realize that if it&#39;s possible I&#39;m willing to give my life for that smile I know I can&#39;t say anything to him even tho I want to but tho the day comes and I&#39;ll say it as many times as I can yes you deserve a better son and yes this bastard of a son love you with all his heart I love you dad

😢 sorry dad 😢
<a href="">1:10</a> <a href="">1:12</a>

Rua doya Bhai ❤😊
Bhai to be honest na mere papa ne mereko aj tak kisi cheez ke liye mana nahi kiya and i think i didnt deserve a man like him to be my dad as bhuban sayed chadar kabhi choti padne nahi di but i was never able to live upto his expectations sometimes i think that iam just not worthy of being son of such a great man but i promise dad i will make you proud some day 😁

6 months ki zid pe ade rehne k bad muje meri pehli bike mili. Ek 2nd hand royal enfield 500. 11th and 12th me mai fail hua. Pr papa ko itna kuch sacrifice karte hue mujse dekha nahi gaya. Aaj me ye message Gujarat ki best Mechanical institute The M.S. University se likh raha hu. N.I.O.S. ki exam hai 3 days me. Fir Gujarat ki one of the best College P.D.E.U me jaunga. Papa ka sapna pura karne ke liye chahe kuch bhi karna pade. Unko kabhi bhi akela feel nahi karne dunga. One of the best Mechanical Engineer banke ek bade se stage par jakar pure desh ko bataunga ki ye mere Papa hai.

Believe me brother, I watch his videos every day while having dinner. Every video has been viewed many times. But even the videos never get old to me❤

OMG😢Bb I love you brother ❤️God bless you

So true bro

Yes Bhaiyaa GGG that TRUE sacrifice they do because they wanted to watch that aur son and daughter are happy know so that&#39;s why they keep sacrifice continuously continuously

Bb made me cry when I saw him. Bhai ek dam mast 😊👍👍👍😭😔😌
❤️❤👏👏❤️❤️Lots Of Love To Parents😊
My father is a politician, owner of a petrol pump, owner of 45 hectares, owner of 4 villages, but still till today he has not worn a shirt.
😊😊this is a most Head teaching vedio

&quot;It is said that the longer the sheet is, the more it should be spread in pairs, but my father never spread the smaller sheets in pairs and he would spread the sheets in long pairs&quot;. Touched by this line
Vai tumne to ruladiya😢....

after watching this video... I am feeling proud that I have bought a laptop with my own money... I did not ask for it from my father... I know it will seem childish to all the people, but it is too much for me... because I know That I did not insist on this to my father.
<a href="">2:07</a> chaddad line was emotional

Love you my parents

it is absolutely true
Yeah I had a laptop which was broken and I needed it for my studies but my parents didn&#39;t do anything to repair it,not every parent is taking care of their children

Amazing 🧡
5 Years,same feeling ,same tears❤
Tum God ho sir

Yes they sacrifice their needs until they are a business man 😂😅

That has a really deep meaning no matter what our parents will there to give us shelter and to fulfill our needs/demands. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll say while your parents are here love them and respect them because once there are gone from then you&#39;re all alone in this world no one to give you shelter or fulfill your demand&#39;s

Family is everything no one is important ❤😊

<a href="">2:55</a> And thats why it&#39;s our duty to give them what they always deserved when we become successful after all its the least we can do for them

Master peace ❤🕊️
No one is better than mother and father ❤️😐🙏

I cried bhuvam bhaiya tumne to
Every Father Love His Son...  You See What you need. Father See What Family Need.Father Never Say You Handle my business Bcoz he know the stress of his business. ...Father suffer from a Rough Way.But He Always Try to Smooth Your way.  - Father Always See With a Smile But Inside  He only Know His Pain His Stress

That&#39;s my first time to note my mistakes ,😔😥😥

Took the laptop for necessity but why was it necessary to watch BBC?
Ab isi laptop ki sari button fameer chipkayga 😂😂😂

Aaj Dad ki Barsi par yeh video dekhne ke baad unki yaad aagyi Feels like he was watching with me

This things inspires us ...nowadays generation...sur ek e rehta hain sirf yantra badalte hain..hum bhi suna payenge hamare bacho ko, ki hamare jamane meh bhuban bam huwa karta tha

Chocolate should not be a little expensive 💔 this is a line which is a true statement of life for us middle and lower middle class.
i am crying bro seriously😭

Chocolate is a little expensive❤️❤️❤️
BB is emotion❤️

😔

(In This Story With Lesson)Apke Pitaji Ka Sacrifices Worthy Tha.. Apke Wajah Se Unka Ek Budi Aadat Chutt Gayi.. Which Was Good For His Own Health Too.. &amp; I Really Appreciate This Frm Ur Perspective..👍🏼Bt, When It&#39;s Turn On U As A Father Then It&#39;s Literally Called &quot;REAL SACRIFICE FOR  CHILDREN&quot;.. Bt, Thing Is That How Much Ur Children Is Worthy Of This Sacrifices Frm Their Parents..*SACRIFICES IS ONLY WORTHY WHEN IT RETURNS/GIVES U BACK SOMETHING FRUITFUL IN OUR LIFE..THAT SHOULD BE CALLED AS A GOOD INVESTMENT👍🏼Bt.. Apka Sacrifice Bass Pani Mein Na Jaye Coz, Apka Beta To Bohat Bada... 🥴😆(Relax.. I&#39;m Talking Abt Nowadays Worthless Children In General Who Really Don&#39;t Give A Damn FK Of Their Parents &quot;Emotional &amp; Meterial Investments &amp; Sacrifices&quot;.. Today&#39;s Children Are Jst DEAD IN THEIR MORALS &amp; SENSITIVE GROUND..)

BB LOVE YOU BHAIYA❤️
Love it...its a pure act 💙💙

I feel better in my heart
BB love you from Pakistan man❤️✌🏻🇵🇰💞🙌🏻🥺

Op

Literally I&#39;m in tears after watching this😢.....Every parents sacrifices a lot for their child to have a better life and we should always be thankful to them what they had done for us....Love u Mom and Dad💞

Papa is very frank, but mummy doesn't listen to me. Only his people live in the house. I never wanted a laptop or chocolate. I want to follow my passion, but even those people don't listen to those people. 😞 That's why only one video has been uploaded on this channel, no second video will be made... Pata nahi 💔
Miss you Abbu ❤️
True

This guy is a legend! From making us laugh to giving us a life lesson he is amazing!

One of the best video of all time in YouTube history

For the last 6 days, brother, I have been watching your video and I have made you cry in my video.

Brother, watch this video seriously and tell me that I love my heart a lot.
Whatever we do for our parents it will never be enough for what our parents have done for us. Always talk to them, understand what they feel and keep them happy as long as they are here for us. I love my parents. Thanks Bhuvan for strengthening my belief.

The Sacrifice

1.8 crore

Bhai heart teaching yaar🥺🥺
Bro mast video banaya he yaar💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Everyone has that true father but not everyone has that son 🥺
In such a situation, who asks for a laptop from his father? I don't want to understand, aaraha🥺
Wow brother, I have become a fan of your app and I am also making videos like you. I am your copy brother.
Super bhai I love my father

There are two messages from this video— first one is that our parents sacrifice their own dreams for us and the second is we should never ask for things which we really don&#39;t need like in this video bhuvan was asking for new laptop for playing games and other things which is not good at all and will just put a burden on the parents. So always try to avoid it and buy anything when you are able to earn.

what a bath 🥺❤
MOM N DAD NEVER SAY NO ❤️❤️😘😘😊😊
We are the ones from whom even that much can be asked.
I was leterraly crying because now days i asking gear cycle from my dad

Miss my dad
Father loves us a lot

Bhuvan sir you are my inspiration and throw this video you you touch my heart from very deeply sir you biggest fan and also a small create (T.S.Y.ENTERTAINMENTS) sir a great love for you 😍😍💗❣💟💓❤💘💕💞

very emotional video

It is not everyone's destiny to meet such a father.
This is my best video

At the age of 48, my father was planning to buy a bike as there was a special sale on Diwali,he was ready with all the documents but witnessing a condition where I was in need of school fees, he immediately discarded his choice and submitted my school fees. It really pinch me when I re imagine how he sacrificed and killed his choice for which he planned for years just to ensure my smooth education... ✨This ignites me to work hard and give him his due respect which for years has been ignored. Stil at the age of 53 he goes to office by walking irrespective of the heat, rain or cold.....

Best concept ❤️
Wonderful brother
Thank you baba for Everything 💗

Did you love my heart?
For every wish fulfilled our parents have sacrificed their needs
Unlimited Fun 😂

Heart Touching Video ❤️
I&#39;ll surely watch this video again but with my parents on tv 🥺

Whatever you say tune last dialogue
Tell me one thing, why are all the logs commenting in English. Those who do not know English will not understand your bad comments. How can someone get a gold medal by commenting in English? The English were forced to run away, but how did the English run away?
Made me cry...😭😭😭

I never liked my father until 12 class. I always complaint about everything he do, literally everything but now I can proudly say that&quot; i love my father more then my mother&quot;.
