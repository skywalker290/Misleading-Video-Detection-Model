Mikili

Wait where is de bruyne?

Who are watching this video in 2023 

France had Mbappé, but Belguim had, Hazard, De Bruyne and Courtois

So much quality on the pitch that night. Very intense match. As a Chelsea fan this makes me sad, seeing Eden Hazard as one of the best players in the world only 5 years ago, and definitely didn&#39;t deserve to lose this game

What happened to umtiti

Good match 
This was the real 2018 FIFA World Cup final:- The best goalkeepers: Courtois and Lloris- The best players: Hazard and Griezmann- The best young player: Mbappe- The two best national teams: France and Belgium

Hazard was truly a legend in this World Cup 

Giroud, go away because you are the worst striker and deserve to play in Al Shoala
<a href="">1:59</a> sad Lukaku.
Legend umtiti sacrificed his career for the world cup.

Severely fierce
The moment that the world best two goal keepers met at the same time...

How Belgium have fallen

Doesn&#39;t matter if France have player&#39;s from Africa. That&#39;s the beauty of ️ France accept colors no hate

It should be forbidden to play with family

It should be Belgium. Arrgh

Griezman the best

Belgium vs Africa
What happened to lukaku?

belgium&#39;s golden era was absolutely mesmerizing to watch

The world cup shouldve ended right then and there. So proud of my Belgium.

This was the real Final in 2018 and Belgium in their prime

dont understand this Giroud can actually be France top scorer when he has no skills at all

Imagine doing that dance to score the only goal

this is the belgium I wanted to see in qatar

Every immagrant become national hero if they succeed its international hipocracy

Thank you Belgium 🇧🇪Thank you France 🇫🇷
Poland is going to knockout France this year

I won&#39;t ever get enough of that catwalk strut celebration by Umtiti.  Just brilliant 

And now Belgium lost to Morroco by 0-2

i still wish we won that game... belgium vs croatia in the finals wouldve been amazing and unpredicted

Anti rascist thumb nail ️
France play well this worldcup

This was the Final that everyone expected

Iconic Celebration from Umtiti 

No God except Allah
I remember Belgium&#39;s counter attacks were great. But Frances defence was greater.

Thats the funniest celebration that I seen in a world cup

2002Jul 10

It was a game which had Mbappe, Hazard, Lukaku, De Bruyne, Griezmann etc.. but at the end we see just 1 goal in the game and was scored by Umtiti 

i hate that this was not the final. these were the best teams of the tournament

Algeria🇩🇿️

Both teams played very well,  but in my opinion Belgium deserved the wc.

I&#39;m hoping the wc champs curse is real this year.... I might&#39;ve jinxed it but still

The two best goal keepers was there.

The legendary Belgian era: Kompany, Chadli, Debruyne, Witsel, Monye, ​​Hazard, Ardirveled, Vertongen, Mertens, Lukaku and Courtois.
No one talking about the clip of the man that was stalling time by walking around with the ball, that clip should be in here aswell

Harzad played really well

Here are the Belgians, we haven't taken our revenge against you in 2015 since our defeat 4 to 3, it's vanquished
4 years later wow times go by fast just remember 2018 like yesterday

Belgium was playing as if they weren&#39;t aware it&#39;s fifa semi final... They didn&#39;t put lot many efforts as expected in the semi&#39;s.

Bruh giroud is just useless asf

&quot;Allay lay bleue!&quot; <a href="">1:52</a>

France is the best dengerous team 🇫🇷
France 🇫🇷 vs Belgium 🇧🇪 should of been the Final of 2018 Their play like a final in that match Les Bleus had full control of the game even though Belgium give us a real challenge

France is a cheating king

It should be final . Right ?

One of the greatest robbery by France with the help of referee

Breaks my heart every time I see this and I keep coming back because just to see what we did wrong look how much chances we had but that doesn’t mean I’m very proud what this generation did we come from far very very far we couldn’t qualify for 2010/2006 and now we did this and now it’s coming to a end probably in Qatar thx for everything golden generation Ps: the most people in Belgium that watch football hate France now because of this and how they played that game

Belgium was better than France

Just hoping Belgium will get to the final in the next world cup ，is their last chance to win it.

Fun fact from now: This is the last match that Belgium didn’t score

Honor to france but Belgium play very very very well it wasn&#39;t a easy task for france.

Technically Belgium was the best team in 2018 World Cup..

️ GLORY TO GOD ️..

Last African team standing

The real WC 2018 Final:

Belgium and Peru were the most difficult rivals for France because they only scored one goal.
<a href="">0:45</a> kompany is bottom nude

Wow, there's a Malaysian flag
There was a free kick for Belgium at 81 minute

Then in 2021 rematch they lose again

Umtiti's happiness, now on the boat is pure bitterness
This should be titled &#39; The fall of Umtiti &#39;

its the real final

I feel like Belgium deserved reaching the final, they put a fight in the World Cup of 2018, maybe in 2022 it’s Belgium’s time 

Yes

Who&#39;s first place in Fifa&#39;s World Ranking?!?

France superior to Belgium is well known
Seum

I love how umtiti celebrated like it was nothing

Ismail smkn 1 watunohu 2016

Nooo

THE WORLD WAS SO WONDERFUL

Belgium barely escaped japan. france was the best allaround team and well deserved champion

France much better
In my view, the Belgian national team is a magical national team. Strange, a country that has never won any championship trophies, but can rank 1 in FIFA.

France win

Belgium did its best! from jp

Witsel

Belgium played well in the tournament. Maybe next time Belgium can make it to the final. But congratulations  to France 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷

Belgium deserved to be the champions

This match was played between France and North France.

Belgium Football Team=South Africa Cricket Team Chokers
I'm satisfied that France lost at the Euro and didn't deserve to be Belgian champions anymore 
Euro 2020,, No Umtiti No party.
Actually this was the final

Our king Llorissssss!!!️
complete template to her honour.  Will England win? Sure, if you look at the armour of the middle flank, however, the England squad haven’t completed the transition of the flannel. I feel Denmark are transitional in the complete approach capacity.

The last goal is saved by courtois which means Belgium but the France enjoys 

Wow France as it best world Cup campaign

Back when hazard was fit !

france made a lot of dirty tackles that wasnt counted idk why the refs didnt call them if those fouls were comminted belgium would of gone through

The exultation of the French always very sober, see pogba&#39;s exultation against Switzerland in the Eurooeum 2020

You guys can see the Malaysian flag there
No one:Absolutely no one:Commentator: &quot;Allei lei bluae&quot;

10 times better than Croatia

So Umititi was the one who won World Cup for France?

Lories
Hopefully Belgium will win Euro 2021 but they have to get past Portugal, Italy, France and England/Germany/Holland in the final.Ultimately whoever comes out of Belgium&#39;s side of the draw will deserve to win it.

at <a href="">1:14</a> is no one going to talk about how amazing that pass was

Hmm...I think Belgium should be very happy that result wasn&#39;t 5 - 0 for France!

Belgium 2020 EUro champion

France is anti football. Everybody knows it!

Thanks for the video

The celebration of Umtiti is legendary.
Sad seeing what happen to umtiti. No games in barcelona. No call up for france =(

Who wants see them in euro 2020 final 

France win a WC on your own merit. Not with foreigners

Idk if you know but france losed because they then can play to ez countrys and win better

<a href="">1:01</a> Barça fans when Umtiti leaves

As a belgian this still hurts to watch to this day

Literally the match was Courtois vs Lloris

Come on blues 
Was there a Japanese dog?
The commentator stresses me out

Refree played for afriance

In what universe do you not include the clock in highlights? FIFA is garbage.

let dance du seum
Somebody like Kane wouldn&#39;t have missed that Tolisso&#39;s shot

Debruyne play was out of the world in this match.

Umtiti

Everybody talks about allison, Ederson, neuyer, oblank, de gea and curtois. But nobody talks about lloris, the most underrated goal keeper in the contemporary football.

belgium deserve to go through but france got it

Belgium was robbed. France should&#39;ve lost.

I like Matuidi&#39;s celebration.. 

Belgium was the worthy of WCBut france was the underdogs and bit Lucky too

France vs Belgium is actually a final match for me. Sorry crotia.

When u realize that the referee was a great fan of France&#39;s team

Alley lay bloa lol.
Having Watched The Belgium Vs France Semifinal match, It was really a battle of Goal keepers and Finally it was The French Goal Keeper who did most of the Saves and therefore won The Match

France cheated

Malaysia 🇲🇾
what skill at <a href="">11:18</a>

Such a wasted chance by Oliver Giroud. He was too slow to strike. That pass by Mbappe was unbelievable

One Thing I Liked The Most about France Vs Belgium Semifinal match was that unforgettable Wink given by one of the French Female fans - What a Lovely Wink!

You have to be a clown to score a goal in a World Cup semi-final and celebrate it like this
umtiti celebration tho

Malaysian flag
this was the real world cup final for me

What part of Africa is France from smh ‍️
This dance ️🇫🇷

Malaysia Flag. Proud of it  . Bangga.

Belgium deserved the 2nd place in this World Cup.

There is a Malaysian flag
Mbappee??? What is this behavior??

Why did you cut out the disgusting time wasting Mbappe did at the end?

They dont let see that mbappe shoot the ball away when belgium have a chance

MBAPPEEEEEEEEEEE

Belgium was the best team of wc 2018

I was as delighted for France as I was devastated for Belgium. Belgium was the best team in that WC, but France had the rage and indomitable spirit of fearless teenagers!

Brazil
Now it&#39;s time to move the borders 

Goalkeeping at its best

That pass from Mbappe to Giroud was pure perfection; pristine,

<a href="">1:14</a> brilliant

It&#39;s more like Africa team  a vs team b.
This was the World Cup final for me

This is the final Croatia 0-5 Belgium

This remindes me of the spain vs germany semi final at 2010The team that won also won the world cup: check1:0 : checkA defender scored in a corner: checkThe loser won the next world cup: maybe??????

France vs France Mini

This win was less deserved than Spain against the Netherlands in 2010

Worst match.

This was the true final

Lucky for us Croats we didn&#39;t get Belgium in semi finals. Belgium deserved atleast 2nd place.

Giroud is bad

Come here to see umtiti walk again 

YES Long live France 🇫🇷

Who is watching in 2021.

The Belgians here is a tip to win the World Cup Support France 🇫🇷
That goal from umity was amazing

I have seen best possible Champion team lost this game.Actually that was the real final match.I m sure if Belgium won they would be champion.Brilliant Belgium team️.

Belgium plays beautifully, I hope they win the 2022 World Cup

Cousins&#39; derby
30 m people just here for see umtiti goal?

If Belgium could’ve won this match. This would’ve been another Spain-Netherlands match. Meaning 2 nations who’ve never made it to final in their own countries history.Both France and Netherlands made it to final its 3 times apiece France wins 2/3 finals and Netherlands 0/3

Belgium was better

Well done Samuel 
The hospitable archer practically possess because dance aesthetically collect for a internal musician. industrious, recondite sleep

The  tuna kinetically turn because cement weekly describe along a anxious border. heartbreaking, bouncy edge

In 1998 it was an Algerian, therefore African, who made pathetic France win by a certain genius &quot;ZINEDINE YAZID ZIDANE&quot; in 2018 world cup bought and won by Africans too, what irony!
As an Italian I congratulate France who won the 2018 World Cup
<a href="">1:51</a> Go blues!!!! In French
<a href="">1:14</a> Real magic
Umtiti
Every time i watch this i just cry we were robbed but this was the final That should have been

Umtiti is being marked by Fellaini still scores. You also need luck to be the world champions.

Mbappe’s pass there tho, crazy

Hazard was the best player during wk 2018 no cap

Breaks my heart every time &lt;/3

It would have been wonderful to watch Belgium vs Croatia WC Final!!

The Thumbnail Like World Cup 1998..Blanc Kiss..

Unlucky belgium. Frances players from france other all countrys

How did belgium lose? They got de bruyne , lukaku , hazard ,

Came back to this and if you put it in slow motion on the goal it was actually an own goal by belgium

Courtois is my Favorite goalkeeper ️ You got to say he’s the beast goalie Real Madrid has had this couple years.

We love umtiti ️
Back when griezmann was fire

What a game

Pogba <a href="">1:02</a> xd

I just found out who will be the champion of the next World Cup

Come with me! In 2010, Spain eliminated Germany 1-0 with a header from a defender (Puyol) and was champion. In 2014, Germany also eliminated France with a 1-0 goal from a defender (Hummels) and was also champion of that Cup. In 2018, France eliminated Belgium 1-0 with a header from a defender (Umtiti) and was also champion. These 3 teams were eliminated with a goal from the head of a defender and in the following World Cup they were champions. Therefore, everything indicates that the next cup that will win will be Belgium ....

It will be??

can&#39;t for 2022 world cup but fuking covid man

ACHETE

People And PoGba 
France dusn&#39;t desurf that winning.

Umtiti was a top CB before his injury

With a seam.
When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.Here is his contact via Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .comTele gram: @Expert_BaylorfxWhatsApp: ️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7.

Umtiti 

Belgium are one of my favourite national teams but im still happy france won because im part french

Wondering what ever happened to umtiti after this world cup

The referee was super biased towards France. It was super unfair
Pogba could have had like 3 assists in this game

<a href="">1:01</a>

2 best teams for this world cups

England were a joke in the WC. A complete waste. They almost lost to Colombia lol. :v What a final Belgium vs France would have been! Croatia did their best but they were just too exhausted by the time the finals came. If only Belgium had lost to England, that would have made the amazing 2018 WC even more surprising and unpredictable!

BOTH TEAM PLAYERS, PLAYED POWERFUL, STAMINA FULL,  TECHNICAL FULL AND STRONG GAME, SOME ONCE IS EXTRAORDINARY AND SOME ONCE IS SUPER EXTRAORDINARY............. BUT WINER IS WONDERFUL............

🇨🇵1-0🇧🇪
<a href="">00:16</a>.. I see my country flags..malaysia..

Courtois have a SEUM 

2021 still remembered this.

Belgium played too well, they didn't deserve to lose that game. :(
Yay France 🇫🇷
GO BLUE 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
My favorite team Belgium and their captain hazard who is my fav player did not make it to the final

Why has Fifatv refused to put out the full match

Who watch 2021

Yes

France was so hard to deny Courtois

So it means 🇩🇰 Denmark is better then 🇧🇪 Belgium because they doesn&#39;t conceeded a goal against 🇫🇷 France 
I come from the future Varane left Hazard without a World Cup and Now Without Champions

Brazil had 59% possession &amp; 27 (9 on target) shots...But Belgium won with the help of an own goal...

im hoping for a revenge in the nations leageu

This was the true world cup final

Revenge in the nations leauge 🇧🇪🇧🇪

<a href="">1:25</a> beautiful tackle

the real final

Loved It !

This was the actual final of 2018

The best 2 teams of that world cup

This was a match between goalkeeper s!

I wanted to see Croatia V  Belgium

JkcmgfnfuMMmmcghb

Hazard was sensational for this whole tournament, a shame his teammates disappeared in this match else they&#39;d have a World Cup.

To this day I still believe Belgium would’ve won without mbappes time wasting

Umtiti

This match should be in final

Belgium 🇧🇪 bad luck, 0-1.....
At least Courtois save Belgium from a huge defeat.....

This was the Real Final.

Mimimaki and hold, he crosses almost an attack, and God has it, and God is, and God is Nayami
<a href="">1:34</a> WAS A FREE KICK! BELGIUM COULD&#39;VE CONVERTED THAT TO A GOAL...
Too bad that France scored just 1 goal.

Belgium hall
This was the final

Who is here after France is drawn against Belgium to play them in the semi finals of the Nations league? A very underrated rivalry between two top Nations 🇫🇷🇧🇪

The earlier final :(

Belgium came into the third place vs England at world cup 2018

Giroud all four goals from chelsea

tense game! duel of the best goalkeepers.

France was better in the game. FACTS.France invented fries. FACTS

if they pulled this goal off, in my books would have been goal of the tournament <a href="">1:12</a>

️ GLORY TO GOD ️
Tong Kowloon

Chelsea Football Sucks beacuse lack of communication

More sadly that&#39;s a show to go on

France is not only the best team, it also has the most toxic celebrations 
I see a malaysian flag

This was the real final

We didn&#39;t see much goal but the toughness and environment of the match was at another level

N&#39;Golo Kante 2016 leads Leicester City to a premier league title. N&#39;Golo Kante 2017 leads Chelsea FC to a premier league title. N&#39;Golo Kante 2018 leads France to a world cup title. Amazing to think any team thought they stood a chance against France when N&#39;Golo Kante was playing. xD!!

A bit bored world cup

The worst world cup in the history

Can you see the Malaysia flag?

If belguim lost to england in the group stages they would probably reached the final

where is the full match ? france vs belgiumtanks

I was predicting Belgium to win the World Cup bruh

Is it the France team???? It looks more like the Senegal team.. XD
<a href="">0:33</a> what a pass <a href="">1:14</a> wow wow wow 
Who noticed hand ball when umtiti scored

Girou the draw
Nut frans
Buena Umtiti

Teo of the strongest in that world cup

that match remember me on Germany Spain 2010

Final euro 2020

Belgium great team all the time always reach knockout stage

France 19 shoots Belgium just 9 .Too bad that France scored just 1 goal.

Look at that accuracy 92% i lost it 

Belgium was no doubt the best team of the world cup 2018! That goal of france was just lucky. Belgium should’ve won 🇧🇪🇧🇪

Hurts to watch this match

Umtiti.

I was a big fan of Belgium but unfortunately they didn&#39;t make it to the final

Belguim was too bad france gave them somting they want

Without Hugo Lloris they couldn&#39;t have made it to Final and Belgium Would be the World Champion

I just noticed every match in the 2018 World Cup is 2 minutes and 10 seconds 

This was the real final of the World Cup.

<a href="">1:13</a>

Lol

Jokes about Umtiti start!

In 2020.... when i watch that match i feel very sad.....love u Belgium.... they played very well....best of luck 2022... love from Bangladesh....

France is my favorite team in football

Africa vs Africa (with a few exceptions)

unfortunately Belgium lost this match

<a href="">1:14</a> that pass from Mbappe was brilliant

Belgium played better than France..just too much reliance on hazard..

Hugo Lloris won for them I mean just Lloris Captain himself to the rescue

Lloris blocking Toby

And I still think belgium was the best club in the World Cup..

Malaydog!

This should have been the real final lol, it was fell matched, a contest between the two best teams.

Sad for belgium, this is their golden generation... hazard, de bruyne, Lukaku, witsel, courtois..

Courtois is still crying, so does Hazard :D

BEST GAME EVER !!!!

This must be the final

Samuel umtiti is best

My opinion:  Belgium should have win the world cup

<a href="">01:12</a> Magic from Mbappe

Cool

Lol France shld have scored more if they weren’t so selfish but I’m glad they won

The real world cup final

S.Umtyti
Though the wink was

Probably should&#39;ve been the final. I&#39;m English and was naturally going for the Three Lions and Croatia were the people&#39;s champions but France and Belgium were the real teams of the tournament.

Just look at the skill of mbappe

<a href="">1:12</a>Brilliant play by the French

Belgium lost because it played funny

Umtiti

france didn’t deserve to win

Lol umtitti celebration
Muslera should not have played that game. He had lost family members a day before the game... Tab arez's mistake...
as italian supporter, when belgium got knocked out of wc, i cried coz belgium deserve to win that...

Giroud funnyman Paul

I continue to come here regularly to drink Belgian tears hahaha 
I think Argentina played better than Belgium against France

Mbappe is the new pele of France
Whatever the Belgians say, having the ball longer than the opponent does not mean that we dominate and that we deserved to win. It's just the result of tactical choices. The French play against, which ipso facto implies giving possession of the ball to the opponent.
Umtiti police

France was better  congratulations 🇨🇵️

Hazard did all his best..but french was parking bus..so many foul on hazard but only few of them are given that ref.was blind

Belgium shouldn&#39;t have started Felliani in this match

This was the best game of the World Cup

What a click bait.. It’s Belgium vs Africa !

Im from belgium, belgium had some top players in their team. But if you look at the french team every player is top class.

Still belgium is far better than France...🇧🇪

Why is nobody talking about how INSANE Hugo Lloris was?

Which country is that McDonald&#39;s team?

Sheh.

:....(

Im convinced that if Fellaini had used some hair wax which makes the hair hard, it would have blocked Umtiti’s header

Watching this in July 2020  it still.... Breaks my heart....... Hazard 

Commentator: after the goal France now can sniff the world cup final. 

I think Belgium deserve to proceed to the WC final and Belgium are better than Croatia France conceded 4 goals , on Belgium one goal

Belgian me
The World Cups are getting worse. Very few goals in decisive instances and when they score they are from corners.
Is it just me, or watching in slow or frame-by-frame at <a href="">1:08</a>, was this actually just an own-goal? Appears to me it hits Fellaini&#39;s head then arm, and the ball only redirects after it&#39;s past Umtiti&#39;s head. &lt;shrug&gt;

why you bully me

Belgium deserved to win the World Cup. I mean, look at all those games they played in this tournament, insane!

La liva la blue France 🇫🇷 From Afghanistan 🇦🇫
f $(*d

If it wasn’t for there goalkeeper Francesco would have been smashed

brave belgium eliminated

What a shame it was only a semi-final pairing.

brave Belgium eleminated

I really hate France for doing that

i only came for umtiti

France were celebrating because they knew they were gonna win the whole thing

Umtiti

that celebration from umtiti is fun

hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh france equipe national afrique hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Lord Giroud
The Belgians insist, according to them they were robbed of the match, in my opinion the EDF has proven itself for a long time, the Belgians are doing well, the score could have been be more severe, they avoided the 3 to zero
GIROUD HE ABUSES 
France style played false
Varane&#39;s world cup was awesome

Its sad that france just slowed everything down at the end so they would be sire to win otherwise belgium would win against croatia definitely

Umtiti! 

it was more a final then Croatia vs. France

whomakes the goal?Me: Umtiti

I was tenax like a thong during this match
Giroud messed up everything

Giroud

I was rooting for Belgium and Croatia

great
That Mbappe flick to Giroud was Zidane-esque

All saying France should have won the 2016 final it is true but it is also true that they didn’t deserve to win the semi final against Germany in 2016 and neither this semi final against Belgium and even more in the final against Croatia there first two goals were not legit and with 1-0 for Croatia at half time the match could have been different

I watched all summaries of the year 2020

They should upload the full match between Belgium vs France They should upload the full match between Belgium vs France

I had more salt for my fries so I came here.
Ooh

Hahahah who put our flag there 
I can not believe how big this game was. You have two of the best nations. Belgium with their golden generation  and Frances new Golden generation.

In my opinion, France had a better team in 2018 than 20 years ago.
It is really well deserved that France won. You can see that they played with love, very happy indeed, celebrating each goal.
The final of Belgium vs Finance should be exciting
lloris have saved France on this WC

both teams were so balanced but Congrats France

Belgium was way better than France. Lloris is just a meme

I&#39;m a belgium fan, but france deseved the world cup!

GO BLUE 
Allez Les Bleus great job with the victory against Belgium!!We enjoyed watching the match between France and Belgium at the semi-finals!!At second half, Umtiti made a heading goal which brought France into the finals to take the trophy!!!

This match was clearly the best of the competition. In its stakes, its judgments, its actions. Really France and Belgium are the two flagship teams of the CDM 2018
Malaysian flag O.13
Back to back world cups where Belgium are in eliminated in 1-0 heartbreak fashions. They’re always so close but I think this time in the next World Cup they will win it. Had Belgium defeated Argentina I believe they go on and beat Germany in the final. Against France that was the final, Croatia didn’t give them fits like Belgium did

Best game

Anyway the best player is Giroud I don't want to hear anything
