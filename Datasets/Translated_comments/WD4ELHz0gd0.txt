These orcas are so intelligent, you know they get bored and tired of not so fresh food, they do eat the birds in the wild, it&#39;s been proven they can easily adjust to the wild if released, because they are wild. No whale should be kept captive.

JUST A REMINDER IF ORCAS HAD LEGS AND FEET HUMANS WOULD BE IN DEEP SH!T

I really dislike seing Whales and Dolphins in captivity. They are extremely intelligent and despite all the play with their zookepers, mostly bored to death.

Bullshit, it&#39;s as bored as fuck in its goldfish bowl and it&#39;s entertaining itself!!! Shame on you all.

Boycott Sea World, animal cruelty scum bags, keeping whales in swimming pools.

So smart

Orca’s should be in one place only. The wild.

Close this damn sea world.  Animals are not clowns to pass the time

SeaWorld is quite literally training monsters

&quot;Failed to hunt birds&quot;

If he knows how to hunt live animals then he&#39;s safe to release into the wild.

That’s so wild they brain size give them a lot of options

Bird: How stupid do you think I am?Orca: Yes.

All Hearts be free ❤ Go 🌱 vegan

Feeding time came early for these orcas.

Now they have something to do in this boredom . So sad 😑

Boycott seaworld.
Free the orcas

1 and half minutes of my life wastes... Fk you!

They&#39;re hunters thats why they do this

Nothing left for them to do being stuck for life in this bathtub with blaring music and boredom. Aside from repeating stupid tricks which if they refuse are starved and psychologically tortured.Brain dead humans giving money to this abuse and letting these companies continue

In addition to being bad people (the workers of this ridiculous site, the viewers with a shitty life who come here and above all the most HDP owner of this... I hope you receive your punishment.
Well stop feeding them old dead fish all day, they should have a habitat to live off of. Not fed by humans with bukets

<a href=""> Hahah that’s great. We went fishing and my buddy was in a standoff with a snowy Egret, it outran him and snagged his bait, smart bird lol.. Cute too..Here’s a video of the little winged bait thief lol.

It&#39;s bored beyond words.

It&#39;s not even for food, they get food properly I would assume, they are not intellectually stimulated enough.  They are natural hunters, apex predators of all seas. They need to hunt to be complete

They’re smart enough to set bait/traps and some how we think it’s okay to cage them

People should stop visiting the sea world. Enough is enough.

Sea world is sick. Just like zoos.

Watch 2023

Everyone in the comments is talking about the intelligence of the Orca, but it may be worth noting that the birds were not fooled.

That&#39;s an investment decision. It decided to invest a smaller sum for a potential bigger profit. The whale also had to overcome his urge for instant gratification (to just eat the fish right now) and do what brings more expected value longterm.  That&#39;s something even humans struggle to do.

I believe this is makani, his older sister Kalia taught him this trick

Humans are way smarter than whales.

Poor animal must be in the 🌊
So amazingly smart

<b>No birds were harmed during the making of this video</b>

if youre not gonna capture a kill, what&#39;s the point?

Look at them cheering to watch the death of innocent Being

This is the hell for this beautiful Animal!!!!!

Eat the fish, eat the fish, don't you see it's delicious? ❤️🐳❤️
We’ll look at those bird brains not falling for it…

waste video

Still not smart enough to not get stuck in a tank by humans.

In the wild he/she would have got out their toaster for those birds and made them his lunch

If you’re at sea world then you support this BS fuck you

We made them very efficient

This video shows a major reason why orcas shouldn’t be in tanks. I’m all for zoos and their conservation and education work, but cetaceans and their borderline sapient intelligence and huge space requirements are a big exception for animals to be kept captive. They belong in the wild to be appreciated from a distance.

That&#39;s exactly what COMMUNISM is. Stupid people thinking politicians and bureaucrats care about them...

Spam

There&#39;s another video that actually shows doing it with success

Unreal that we keep them in little pools. Sickening.

Tired of eating fish.

Poor orca… 😢
I love orca 💖💖😭
Orca really understand the term of capitalism

“aw look he’s sharing his foo- oh”

This is why these animals shouldn&#39;t be in captivity. 🙅🏻‍♀️

Orcas be like - Bored of eating fishes... Lets eat birds.....

I thought he was trying to throw it further

When you wish you chose the crispy chicken sandwich instead of the fillet of fish sandwich.

This is heartbreaking to watch such an intelligent animal cage, the human&#39;s days are numbered

I’m on the team of sea world animals eating anything. These are apex predators in an enclosure. Free them

When you&#39;re so bored in your jail cell, you start killing little critters to kill the time

The thing that baffles me is that he had the restraint and foresight to save the fish for this from when he was last fed

Fuck sea world

Why eat fish when you can have bird!

Gotta keep yourself amused in prison.

Well it&#39;s not like the killer whale can go to the park to feed the pigeons..

They did not loose their hunting skills!! That is only another SW lie!!

Just shows how bored it is!!!!

Incredible beautiful and intelligent animal. NO TO ABUSE AND SHOWS WITH ANIMALS.
Please stop putting Orcas in jails like this. They belong in the ocean

Keeping these intelligent magnificent animals in captivity to perform tricks for humans should be banned immediately.

Go ahead...take it

1.  Their Sunburns Are Covered Up With Black Zinc OxideOrcas at SeaWorld spend most of their time floating listlessly at the surface of the water with little to no shade from the hot blistering sun.  In the wild.  orcas spend up to 95 percent of their time submerged and would find shade in the depths of the ocean.  but at SeaWorld their tanks are far too shallow.  Their deepest tank is 40 feet deep—not nearly deep enough to give them a reprieve from the harsh elements.  Because of this.  orcas have perpetual sunburns.  which are shielded from the public eye with the help of black zinc oxide.  which matches their skin.  Although zinc oxide is also used as a sunblock.  orcas almost always have sunburn before it is applied. 2.  Some Orcas Were Kidnapped and Sent to SeaWorldFive orcas currently at SeaWorld were kidnapped from their ocean homes.  as were others who have since died.  For example.  Tilikum.  a 32-year-old orca.  was captured at the age of 2 by a marine “cowboy. ” Tilikum wasn’t taken from his natural environment because he was injured—instead.  he was torn away from his family against his will and confined to a small concrete tank for a hefty profit. 3.  Killed If Not CapturedIn 1965.  the first-ever orca show at SeaWorld was performed by a female orca named Shamu at SeaWorld San Diego.  During Shamu’s capture.  her mother was shot with a harpoon and killed before the young orca’s very eyes by a marine “cowboy” named Ted Griffin.  Griffin’s partner.  Don Goldsberry.  later worked for SeaWorld and was assigned to bring orcas into the park.  He continued kidnapping and slaughtering orcas.  and at one point.  he hired divers to slit open the bellies of four orcas.  fill them with rocks.  put anchors around their tails.  and sink them to the bottom of the ocean so that their deaths would not be discovered. 4.  Trainers Masturbate the Whales to Collect SpermIn nature.  orcas choose their own mates.  But at SeaWorld.  orcas are forced to breed on a regular basis.  Male orcas are trained to float on their backs.  and their trainers masturbate them to collect their sperm.  Females are artificially inseminated and forced to breed at a much younger age than they would in nature.  Katina is used as a virtual breeding machine and is even being inbred with her own sons. 5.  Unsafe For SeaWorld’s TrainersSeaWorld’s corporate incident log contains reports of more than 100 incidents of orca aggression at its parks.  often resulting in injuries to humans and even causing one death by extensive internal bleeding. Following a 2006 attack by an orca on a trainer at SeaWorld in San Diego.  the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health concluded that it was “only a matter of time” before someone was killed while interacting with the orcas.  A further investigation into these attacks could have prevented injuries and deaths. 6.  Orcas In Captivity Have A Shorter LifespanOrcas in the wild have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years—their estimated maximum life span is 60 to 70 years for males and 80 to more than 100 for females.  The median age of orcas in captivity is only 9. 7.  Collapsed Dorsal Fins Are Not Normal or HealthyIn captivity.  all male orcas have collapsed dorsal fins as adults.  which is a sign of an unhealthy orca.  SeaWorld claims that this condition is common and natural for all orcas.  However.  collapsed dorsal fins are caused by the unnatural environment of captivity and are rarely seen in the wild.  Only 1 to 5 percent of male orcas in some populations (and none in others) have fully collapsed dorsal fins. 8.  Trainers are Performers.  not BiologistsContrary to popular belief.  trainers often have no formal education in marine biology.  Their main purpose is to entertain and put on a “good” show for visitors.  not educate people about the intelligence.  social nature.  or natural families.  foraging behavior.  and habitats of the animals held at SeaWorld. 9.  SeaWorld Fails to Care for AnimalsOn January 11.  2012.  the USDA issued an official warning to SeaWorld San Antonio for its “repeated failure to provide drain covers that are securely fastened in order to minimize the potential risk of animal entrapment”—a violation that resulted in the death of a sea <a href="">lion. In</a> March 2013.  prompted by PETA’s complaint about a child who had been bitten by a dolphin at SeaWorld.  the USDA conducted an investigation and cited the marine park for several violations of the Animal Welfare Act.  including the use of expired surgical materials.  some almost a decade old.  The USDA also documented that a dolphin tank and the areas surrounding the orca performance tank were in disrepair and contained cracked and crumbling concrete and rusty beams that could pose a threat to the health and safety of both the animals and workers.  The USDA pointed out that the unsafe conditions “might create a health risk if these pieces of concrete fall off into the pool and get ingested.  or if they become abrasive” and that they “do not facilitate cleaning and disinfection. ”10.  Animals Suffer in Cramped.  Unnatural Living ConditionsSeaWorld confines whales and dolphins—who often swim up to 100 miles a day in the wild—to tanks that.  to them.  are the size of a bathtub. SeaWorld presents itself as a family establishment full of fun “educational” activities.  However.  these activities harm animals physically and emotionally.  SeaWorld has the financial means and ability to create coastal sanctuaries.  where the orcas would have a more natural and less stressful life and where they could feel the tides and waves; see.  sense.  and communicate with their wild relatives and other ocean animals; and engage in other natural behavior that they are now denied.  However.  the park instead chooses to stick with the same inhumane business model that it has used for 50 years.  despite all the violent and deadly incidents and evidence of harm.  Please say NO to SeaWorld and its enslavement of animals by refusing to buy a ticket to this abusement park.  and ask the marine park to release these animals to sanctuaries. 

The orca is just tired of fish &amp; chips.. kfc is good as well

there&#39;s fishing, and there&#39;s birding .I&#39;d trade a rotten herring for a fresh chicken too.

Wow, Hello my friend.. All the best to your channel and hope you have a wonderful day

orca wasn&#39;t sure to wait for whistle to eat thank god it used it&#39;s own instincts

🤔 Can&#39;t they teach wild orcas to perform for food. That way theme parks get their shows and these smart creatures keep their freedom? Animals outside can do it and clearly they seem far smarter than pigeons.

He was just sharing his fish with the birdie, haha

Either it’s very bored or very clever

Did it set up a trap?!

He was trying to share with them

Stop going to these shows so sea world stops taking them from the wild

Orcas and other animals deserve liberty not slavery for Entertainement of bullshit

Hello dumbo, it&#39;s not an ice floe
Perfect eg of baiting and bashing 😄

Incredible

Dont support Seaworld! Dont buy tickets or anything. These places are FUBAR.

Every impulse they have is to hunt

What a creature mind of 🐬 , body of 🐋 , kill like a shark 🦈

“Take the fish bro”“No 🗿”“Aight i’ll just eat it then 😔”

He is not hunting at all. He is playing, feels lonely, feeds the birds.

I can&#39;t believe they don&#39;t attack humans they are so smart

I can&#39;t people would do such horrible things

They aren&#39;t killer whales...geez the real killers own the fucking place

<b>&quot;Take it, Gorgie...!&quot;</b>

...the fish? Is bait, honey. I hear those see birds taste just like chicken...

Now that’s just scary how that orca willingly put that fish up there

Natural behaviour in an unnatural environment.

Then if you don&#39;t want i&#39;ll catch my fish back.

Dude went birding

I&#39;m an unashamed meat eater... but yall jailing animals for human entertainment (money) , you&#39;re quite the piece of crap.

Oooh look how intelligent they are! Lets be honest if they were that intelligent they would escape.

the funny part is ive seen videos of birds dropping bread into a pond to bait fish.

Amazing the whale is trying to BAIT em

a whale belongs in the sea, not in a bathtub

We are fortunate that humans aren’t on the menu for Killer Whales or we’d have to stay on shore. These animals are spooky smart. It pains me to see them in captivity.

Fuck seaworld big time. Torturing animals. Let alone such intelligent, and especially emotionally Intelligent creatures

The birds weren&#39;t buying this Orca&#39;s trick; they&#39;ve probably watched it do this to one of their unlucky comrades before. 🤣

This is why eating whales or hunting them is a crime! They are intelligent beyond our comprehension!

Free ice cream inside the truck birds, get in!

Just wanted to feed the birds

Incredible. Intelligence and beauty wasting away in a tank not large enough to live in...

This is like the funnest thing these orcas can do there

The orca gave them a fish to try and prove it&#39;s not a threat. The amount of patience it must take to save little prey for bigger ones is astounding.

I feel like chicken tonight!
POV: the orca is big brain

kalia is known for doing this(as she is featured in the video), shes actually quite good at it too

It&#39;s funny how this Orca wants the Bird to come close so that the Orca wants to eat the Bird.

They have amazing problem solving ability when I was a kid we went there it actually caught one , he stayed just below the edge and waited for good minute one of the birds moved perched on edge of the pool and he shot up out of the water grabbed it before it could fly out of reach it cool watching him keep trying different tactics until he grabbed one

So clever, but sad they are reduced to only hunting like this. 😢

I wonder how animals think of us

Not sure it was baiting birds...

... people are amazed at animal&#39;s intelligence for some reason? tf do you think other animals are? brain-dead murder machines who only exist to kill? so stupid 💀

I&#39;m waiting for him to eat the bird. What a disappointing video.

It didn’t catch a bird

Y’all talking bout how smart they are but so are the birds lol

If this Orca is hunting these birds, how long will it be before Orcas start making a meal out of us?

When intelligence, is surrounded by idiots.. This should be banned

Whats sad is they are doing this out of sheer boredom to break up the monotony of swimming in circles every day.

Proves the animals are not getting enough fish to eat in the sea there real home with there families these animals eat fish not birds what does that tell you you are paying to watch cruelty and greed these animals are in a swimming pool in a jail for the rest of there life&#39;s please save your money up and go see these wonderful animals in there real home see how happy they are and see them with there families all sea life centre&#39;s don&#39;t dare about these animals otherwise they would let them be free it&#39;s the greed they want

Look at their intelligence!
I guess he got tired of seafood

Orca whale was like “Oh so now y’all vegan all of a sudden” 😒

There is a video of a sea world orca doing this and it succeeding for those interested: <a href="">

The sad thing is this is probably the most stimulating thing that’s happened to them :(

Just watched a totally different video this morning and the Orca succeeded. Amazing. We have a lot to learn.

Anyone who loves whales knows Killer Whales kill everything! In Spain they attack sailboats!

These creatures need to be set free. They don&#39;t belong in captivity like this.

Come here! Goood fish over here! 😂

Pool jail world.

Absolutely cruel . Set it free you Bastards

Everyone say thats so amazing… Imagine how amazing it would be could live in freedom. They are clearly unhappy

Don&#39;t keep such amazing animals in captivity

So so cute ❤️
He throws up a bunch of fish to catch some scrawny bird.

Terrible.....Just watching the video the jingle music is annoying. The poor orcas and dolphins 👎👎👎👎👎
These animals are trapped inside a chafe far to small for them. It makes me sick you All pay sea world to see these captive animals.

Animal cruelty.
Beats eating dead fish

I don&#39;t know who I feel more sorry for, the whale for being used as toy for people&#39;s amusement, she clearly wants to be a whale and hunt and is being restricted or the birds who are fragile and fall victim of them in the wild.

<b>That&#39;s a well orcastrated strategy.</b>

Just keep in mind orcas are just really big dolphins they are super smart

Damn…set the animals free.

Poor buddy… 🥺 wants to be free …

The smartest whale I&#39;ve ever seen

Amazing how he baits them

Some guy at one of these shows hid and when the park closed he jumped in the tank to play with the killer whale - well in his autopsy report it stated that his genitals had been bitten off - along with a lot of other disfigurements - so that cuddly cute killer whale you see at the show aint so cute and cuddly up close lol

No wonder this thing eats great whites for breakfast and lunch 😋

Beautiful animal. Should not be in a tank.

<a href="">#freetheorcas</a> <a href="">#boycottseaworld</a>

It&#39;s amazing how smart this creature is

God won't invent anything for free
Its so sad to see a beautiful and intelligent creature like this getting tortured by humans. It has to stop. Why does people still support sea world?

Wow. They are incredibly intelligent. Using bait to try to trap the bird.

<b>This guy are sneaky*****THE BOXNEWS****</b>

These Orcas are amazing. I can&#39;t wait to see the show. The orcas and trainers work really well together.

Not even a dog would be capable of doing this, and even if we would keep a domestic dog in a small cage for life it would be horrible, yet they keep a more intelligent WILD animal in a tank that is so small and boring for them

They are so intelligent and have to live their lifes in a small boring tank...

And yet you enjoy to keep them kept in a small tank. Just a big NO!

That&#39;s not really aggressive I&#39;ve seen orca&#39;s behave way more aggressive than thatThat is very playful orca

🤮🤮🤮🤮 Orcas in captivity
green heron doing the reverse <a href=""> it takes the bait

Poor guy his evolutionary code is to hunt.   Humans have captured and engaged him for life.

the bird : i can do this all day

And Japan kills them for food.

Wait where is it keeping the fish

I knew these whales would one day rise up and run the world, it’s starts with the birds😝💯

Why most say the fins of orcas in captivity are down due to being ill or depressed due to captivity? I&#39;ve been on the pacific ocean and saw orcas in the wild having (back above the surface) the same downward fin? ...

They are such smart creatures and they are using these magnificent creatures for cheap circus tricks.

I prefer when they hunt their trainers

They are actually gangsters in the ocean

Those birds know thing or two about free food... they wr like &quot; yeah right &quot;

I love 🐋 so Much

A beautiful and quiet place that brings comfort to you😊😊😊😊😊👍👏
Clickbait
LOLLLLLL

It&#39;s a mam-meal-ian trap

Free all orcas  and dolphins

Scariest animal to face, at least to me. Even more than a tiger because a tiger would kill me quick but I feel like orcas are smart enough to torture and maybe kill me slowly

It seems absolutely stupid to me that they want to train these animals.
They are very cute and intelligent animals.
I only have one thing to say:  Fuck SeaWorld

That&#39;s because they are hungry..lol

it&#39;s incredible, killer whales and dolphins  seems humans with just a very different shape

I wonder if this tactic was coined by the seaworld orcas or is it also done in the wild

Well if a whale can fish for birds without having arms aliens are probably real to.

Sea world is abhorrent

Plot twist: the whale is very lonely and is trying to make friends

Karen buggin
Too bad at the end when the bird was right on the edge, the second orca you never knew about popped up and grabbed it.  That would indeed be a clever girl

Whale : Here mate , sharing is caringEveryone : BAITING!

Them things kill and or eat everything

Too Cute Zebra at Lincoln Park Zoo playing with his toy ball and spinning on top of it.  <a href="">

Because being stuck in a cement pool for human yeehaws doesn&#39;t squash their hunting instincts. They need to start eating all the trainers so they will release them.

“I don’t get where he’s getting the fish from…he’s just storing them in his tummmmmy?!” 😂😵‍💫

Oh wow I just realized how smart there were

These whales do not belong in captivity

Orca: i see uBirb: got any fishOrca: sorry it mine lol

That Orca is more intelligent than some people.

Maybe they should throw one of their live seals in the tank so the Orcas could realize their natural instincts

Clickbait 100%Total thumbs down.

They do  not belong in concrete tanks the size of bathtubs for them. Let them out.

poor animal, should be set free :(

Knife manufacturing
Sad 😢 for him seaworld 👎🏿💀
That music allways plays makes the orca i Sane, free them

please do not support this shows with killerwales. These poor wales have a terrible life and they will get aggressive with time. PLEASE WATCH BLACKFISH ON NETFLIX, SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

please do not support this shows with killerwales. These poor wales have a terrible life and they will get aggressive with time. PLEASE WATCH BLACKFISH ON NETFLIX, SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

Just set her free

I think he was mad at himself for spitting the bait a little too far

Actually the sea mammals feel so bored in captivity-I don’t even know how cute great amazing that can be. Animal welfare is only freedom. Nothing else

Using a bait. Just impressive

Oh yeah. That DOLPHIN is smart as all get out. Birds aren&#39;t totally dumb either. They need to quit teasing him. He&#39;s halfway across that platform already. They&#39;re behaving naturally. Too bad Orca isn&#39;t free like the birds.🤬💔🐬 Pretty obvious he is not content with an old dead fish either.

<a href="">1:00</a> “I’m gonna get ya! Lol come on, just a wing. That’s all I want.” 😂

What else is the poor guy supposed to do other than keep himself busy?
it is cruel to keep these animals in captivity, worthy of medieval societies 👎

F*ck Sea world

Dislikes show people stupidity lol.

Are birds tastier than fish?

Fuck Sea World, that evil place . Hope the director board all die a horrible death

Clickbait. This is unremarkable to say the least

This is so cruel.

Bird: we dont want nothing you coughed up. Bye

And kids this is why you don’t talk to strangers!

<b>Dear person who may be reading this</b>

.

.

<b>You’re amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a amazing rest of your day</b> ❤

Don’t watch these shows you dumb people!

They hunt and kill birds out of pure envy. Those killer whales know that they are trapped in an unnatural habitat and hate the fact that birds are free to come and go as they please. Also, those birds be talking mad shit to the whales.

It he is making friends,catch food or plating games. Either way it&#39;s SMART!

What&#39;s this Nonsense? Title is saying it hunts birds . Instead it was only paying with them . Idiot uploader..

I fucking hate sea world so much. I fucking hate this I hate it. Clicking off now ugh

I just came here to tell u who went to sea world to go fuck urself

Wild animal doing what it does best 🕊🙏💜
I give you fish u give me chicken ,it&#39;s.a fair deal ..

To me, that&#39;s a dolphin. a big, black and white dolphin. don&#39;t be giving me any cheeky about that either, children.  I&#39;m older than the lot of you

so you dont want it? i eat it then.

Something to do.

I&#39;ve seen a bird use bread to catch fish... but i&#39;ve never seen it done the other way around. Fish catching birds.. Armagedon is not far off..Yes i know its a fkn mamal, not a fish. Just shut up and enjoy the joke

So good.
Seaworld is animal abuse

Even more amazing, he won $45k that morning playing online poker...

Clear proof how fucking Orcas are bored AF in those waterworld places.....They dont even eat birds, but as bored as they are they still decide to amuse themselves killing them

People: look, he&#39;s using bait.  He&#39;s so smart.Angler fish:  what am I, invisible to you people?

Kalia seems to enjoy hunting/annoying the birds

To me keeping these prime predators is a total shame. This Orca deserves a life of freedom of the Ocean. I strongly believe we should never kill a animal unless r own survival depended on it. These beautiful creatures need to be left alone

LMFAO he was like &quot;C&#39;mere I promise&#39;Iwon&#39;eat&#39;chuh&quot;

Sad life

This is not amazing theses  Beautiful animals should be in the wild not in captivity

<a href="">

Torture on animal

Nothing happens

This video sucks

This video is a waste of time

Do not waste your time

Nothing happened in this video

This video sucks

Don&#39;t waste your time, nothing happened

Waste of time, nothing happened. Delete this video

So what would you call that... Obviously not fishing... So, what... It was birding?

It should be a crime to lock an orca up like this.

No dislikes possible. Guess why 😅

The only time an orca has ever been known to kill a human has been at sea world...

The birds probably went there to watch the shows. &quot;look there is another one having to do tricks for the humans.....taken away from its mother.....&quot;

Instead of eating small fish, he used it to get much bigger piece. What a smart lad

its disgusting that we still have large animals like that stuck in tiny tanks or enclousures.

misleading title...i really wanted to see a bird get eaten!!! lol jk but seriously though.

I have a theory that they use seals as bait for luring in sharks

Everybody is praising the whale , but nobody is praising the birds. Who didn&#39;t fall for the oldest trick in the book.

That&#39;s just sad.

Too bad Orcas are kept in concrete cages. Shame on Sea World

Smart Fish uses fish for flying fish

They are not called killer whales for  nothing

Read or heard somewhere they are the second most socially developed animals on the planet after humans. I used to be a huge shark fan, but Orcas are the true apex predator, well after us.

Sea World is disgusting.

I&#39;ll never get that 1.30 mins back....

It is cruel to keep them in a little box. Its like death row.

Something that smart should not be in that tank.

This is lowkey terrifying

Free that whale! Please!

He&#39;s like a giant drunk baby
Still has killer intent on their mind

Steve bird  “look, look, look, look, this is what the whale does to get us” jim whale “ stop spilling my secrets Steve” Steve  “ ay fuck you jim”

Best &quot;hunting&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen. He must have killed 20 birds.

illuminati does the same but it baits you with a vax

There is no way we should continue to imprison Orcas for our own amusement.  How sick is that?

I hate seeing Orcas in tanks. It&#39;s heartbreaking 💔.  Shame on SeaWorld.

Please tell me this circus is already closed. These orcas need to go back to the ocean

Orcas are awesome.  People should throw some killer salt crocs and sharks into that pool to entertain that energetic Orca.  I am sure the Orca won&#39;t object to that idea.  Much more challenging than birds.

This video would&#39;ve been slightly less depressing to watch if that beautiful animal wasn&#39;t behind concrete barriers like that. I know it&#39;s dangerous but I&#39;d much rather encounter one of those in the wild.

Turn off the stupid music.

Whoever endorses or spends money at SeaWorld is just as sick as the people that started it

It&#39;s insane how smart Killer Whales are....

The bird&#39;s are almost as smart as the whale imo

How people get pleasure from seeing  killer  whales in Captivity or wild animals in a Zoo in beyond me. how would you like to be in prison for the rest of your life?

Clever.. Scary really to see how intelligent these animals are..There&#39;s a certain sense of unease knowing that they seem fully aware and calculated at all times..I wouldn&#39;t want to go swimming with them just incase they decided to humiliate me knowing Im not in my natural environment..They know !!

Does he actually get one

This is like when the man in prison plays with a mouse To keep from going  Out of his mind...

To smart for captifity

These dummies don&#39;t know where the fish come from

He is baiting them

That was awesome to see

Thinking how the lure the bird in

A bad day fishing is better than a good day at Sea World

Where&#39;s the Hunting at? All I see is stalking.  Smh

There&#39;s a video of a leopard seal offering a penguin to an underwater photographer. That seal was trying to make friends with the diver though. Perhaps Willie was trying to make friends with those egrets.

GD that thing is smart.  Imagine if it ever figured out it can kill humans.  Oh wait..

Amazing to see the smart Orca using bait to try catch the birds.Orca&#39;s are way smarter than herons,but herons use bait to catch fish as well

Wow

Girl is simply feeding the birds.

Poor whale is so smart and stuck in that tank that he has to play this game to entertain himself and that’s all he can do

Smart!

I’m glad he’s the last in a pool. Can’t keep those things as pets it’s cruel.

Whomever the IDIOT was who payed to enter this PRISON to entertain him/herself, should be ASHAMED!! BOYCOTT SEAWORLD!! Free these innocent prisoners!

There&#39;s chlorine in that water and it&#39;s blinding the whale fun facts f*** SeaWorld

Killer whale is a grand chessmaster

Here some fish birdies come get it 😋

He like chicken also

Any time an animal uses a tool to gain something it demonstrates the IQ of a 9 year old....

Imagine the boredum

Whale: Take it, or I’ll take youBird:👀

This animals are not Made for humans fun in little pool. But them into this natural Ocean.but its to late,they dont find food becaus he never had learnd

Didn’t catch a bird thro

Dawn Loved Tilicum!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Whales are smarter than what we probably really know.

At <a href="">4:59</a> in this video <a href=""> Orkid got one, then immediately went to share it, just like they do in the wild.

At that time I was in the Smn with the military who said vrgaaa for everything 🥺
Where&#39;s there eyes

The same way birds bait fish with bread crumbs

my absolute favorite animals i love orcas and dolphins they are super clever <b>-</b> ❤

Hate you , he is in prison ffs.

Animal free, noto in jail

So sad to see such a beautiful and intelligent creature locked up in a prison like that. The people who support these parks should be ashamed of themselves.

Damn these whales are crazy smart, if they ever figure out how to get around on land, we are all screwed.

No bird eaten.  90 seconds wasted.

That,s how incredibly smart it is, amazing!!!

They never loose their instincts!

Ask from people seeing that
Free a poor prisoner

This video needs more cowbell

Knowing they&#39;re that smart and that it&#39;s also the animal who has the most culture after humans (yes, culture - they have dialects and can learn hunting techniques or games from other pods of orcas, which I find CRAZY), it really makes you wonder how cruel it is to keep them in zoos and marine parks. They&#39;re way too sentient for this.

And still you have to cage these beautiful intelligent animals :(

This clickbait video does not deserve 10k dislikes but 33k of them.

Whale just wants some chicken.

The black and white whale wants some chicken

I hope Orcas don&#39;t grow legs...

This is prison.

Not hunting, should be teasing. Orca had high iq in the animal world.

Orca: I just wanna be friendsSeabirds: You know this place has inhouse cctv cameras right? What did you do last week?Orca: huff (takes fish back and swims away) 😁

Why isn&#39;t this banned yet !!! Caging an animal for selfish humans to gloat at THIS DISCUSTS ME AND NEEDS TO STOP AND ALL YOU LOT SOPPORTING THIS I HOPE YOU ALL END UP WITH NO FREEDOM AND PEOPLE LAUGHING AT YOU !!! THIS POOR ANIMAL SHOULD BE IN THE WILD NOT IN A TANK 😥😓

&quot;Excuse me sir, you have such a nice sharp beak, could you help me pick my teeth?&quot;

Joe Biden tryin to get a 2nd term

Waste of time

Apex predator a true Apex

Look all this comments.... its look funny an hyper intelligent and social animal live like this for our entertainment??!!!...... let&#39;s try to live looking forward. Making more difference in this world. Let&#39;s try to look at things in a more profund way. FREE THEM!!!!!!!!

Orca: “ Ya feelin Lucky? …..punk !!!!
It&#39;s scary how intelligent they are

I worked for Sea World San Diego a few times. The whales get routine meals before after and between shows, which was basically just a big bucket of chum, fish and what not. These orcas would let some of that food sit and float on the water to attract the seagulls and get another free meal. I never saw them actually get a seagull, they flew away just in time. However one of my coworkers saw it. Orcas are dangerously intelligent.

Fish OR Fowl

Real talk bro 💯 Tru.
They shouldn&#39;t be in Seaworld they should be in the Sea!

For an &quot;intelligent&quot; creature he sure didn&#39;t catch any birds

If we stopped going to these places these highly intelligent mammals could travel thousands of miles hunting mating and having a free life, can no one else see this?

Let our Oceans and Seas return to their natural state.  Stop all illegal fishing.  China has quite a few ships doing illegal fishing.  I do not agree with industrial fishing trawlers as they rape the oceans and seas.  Finland, Iceland and Japan are all killing whales of any size, even small ones.  Stop all whale killing guys.  We need to clean up fish farms from mercury and use only fish farms for our seafood.  Remove all fishing for profit and only for self use.

Orca: Hey I got fish Birds: I think the fuck not

Or swim thousands of miles round and round in a tiny tank... FOREVER... FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT.

FUCK SEAWORLD

He's hunting me. I think he wanted to eat chicken
With all that intelligence that poor creature is doomed to a life of suffering in a bathtub to be gawked at by idiot&#39;s.

That animal is way too smart to be kept in a fish bowl

I love how the orca has a predatory smile

NUKE the whales!

I went to the Sea World in Orlando around 2000 and I watched a lone 1200+ pound Polar Bear walk side to side in his indoor enclosure for over an hour. The enclosure was about 50 feet wide and 100 feet deep with a small pool in front up by the glass so ppl could watch him swim. He placed and placed and placed and paced. This poor bear walks 20+ mile in a day in the wild. It was beyond  cruel. I would never spend a penny at a Sea World Torture  Factory or any type of of place that makes money off the suffering of animals.

what a fucking dumb ass fish... shoulda had more patience and put the bait closer to the edge... no wonder humans rule this planet...

He wants KFC

They seem like the jerks of the sea, beating up dolphins, other whales.

Idk why everyone so shocked they are intelligent.

Yes holding them in captivity is abuse!!

Poor things are just bored to death. At least they&#39;re able to hunt something instead of just having food thrown into their mouths.

Hey, God loves you. Jesus says in John 3:16 &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.&quot;. This verse means that the moment that you believe that Jesus, the Son of God, died on the cross for the sins of the world and rose again from the dead, your name will be written in heaven, and you will have everlasting life in heaven with the Lord Jesus after you die on earth. So repent, ask God for forgiveness of your sins, and put your faith in Jesus Christ our Lord. The Lord God richly bless all of you.

<a href="">1:34</a> he never eats one 🕐

Yeah, I like fish..Sometimes, I crave chicken.

Imagine being sooo Intelligent and having to act like a Clown to get food while being locked in a tiny Pool.Kill Sea World.

Free the poor thing. If you want to see an animal, go to their habitat.

Dolphin&#39;s Intelligence is greater than that of Einstein&#39;s impostor.

Wtf

what a waste of time

Sigh... Hate the fact that aquariums are acceptable to the masses despite knowing that these types of animals have a degree of intellect. Ig at the end of the day, aslong as humans r happy all is good

&quot;killer Whale&quot;...?!   Idiots!  Those are a DOLPHIN!

It&#39;s smart enough to know that potentially losing a fish for something that is higher in nutrition, and is willing to do so, means it has critical thinking skills... Orcas should be banned from captivity along with many other highly intelligent mammals.

Eat more CHICKEN

.... unsuccessfully.

F*ck seaworld

Yeah, if i had to choose between eating a whole raw reasonably fresh fish and a live flapping bird including its feathers and long legs it would be fish all the way baby absolutely no second thoughts, even just the thought of that birds awful cloaca is enough to seal the decision

And they say they wouldn’t be able to learn to hunt in the wild if their released? Bs.

Such an intelligent animal
Smarter than the humans keeping him in a pool!

Next thing you’ll know it will be Hunting humans ….wait a minute 🤨

lovely dolphin

This orca just wanted to be a real whale and attempt to hunt. Just goes to show how devilishly smart these animals are.

The whale was using bait which demonstrates intelligence but it ruined the whole operation by getting in the way and scaring them off.

I love how theres almost 10k dislikes cus we didnt see it catch one 😂☠

Human are so cruel.   Give them their freedom you motherfuckers

That&#39;s not hunting

Maybe he&#39;s being friendly.  It must be lonely being in that tank all day.

Prefers chicken for fish.  How interesting.

why do they believe him xDD
There should be no whales dolphins or any other animals held in unnatural captivity fort the pleasure of pathetic human beings.

FREDON THE  KILLER WHALE !!!

Smart. Should not be held captive

This is actually bloody garbage. What hunting? All I see is a whale barfing up fish to try and lure birds and the birds aren&#39;t having it. Shitty video!

I imagined what he said while he saw the birds flying: "I want freedom so much, what can you be free?"...
It is smart

it is sad see Killa Orc in a swim pool🖕

That things smarter then most the people I work with!

seems more like he&#39;s just feeding/interacting with them

Fuck sea world and anyone who supports them.

Intelligent animals are the scariest.

A nice break from killing the staff

&quot;Hi birds, I&#39;m Shamu the friendly whale. Have some fish.&quot;

It might also just like playing with its food

First of all, wtf are you doing at Seaworld

Birds: “something fishy is going on here…”

Orca : was doing some birding.

Let them free bastards

Whale: eat the fish! Do it, pussy!

The bird is delicious, even I would eat

SeaWorld aka Orca Hell
Trainer is next

That laptop is bigger than the whale.

Whale: come over ere free food Bird: that’s exactly what the last whale said. N NOW I have one leg

If you were fed frozen fish all the time, you too would want fresh meat.

Orca: you birds are free, I’m not…

How many fish does he lose to the Pelicans before he scores one scrawny bird that&#39;s mostly feathers anyway?

Smart puppy 🦈🐕 very noligable.  Wonder what he (or she) would tease us with ?🤔

I see no &quot;Killer whales&quot; in this vid.  Only broken and captive ORCAS.

Set the orcas free.

Smart little whale, got the brain and the brawn. The birds just had good instincts

Thrown the green to take mature 😅😂

He defines looks like she’s laughing lmaoooo

He was feeding the birds fish not using lure…Omg

It's a trap, the orca wanted to eat the birds.
Orca: Im tired of sea flavor foodBirds: You dont fool us… Orca: Take this, as a sign.Birds: Hummm, maybe not, you already had a bite on that fish.

Fuck me 1.34 of my life wasted waiting for something, anything to happen. Stop posting shit vids on Youtube!

Praise God
Hm...looks more like Orca feading those birds.

Never hunt nothing

But why is is hungry? Why hasn&#39;t it been fed?

I saw no hunting of birds

They are usually pack hunters. It&#39;s amazing to watch them hunt in the wild, not in captivity.

Watch &quot;Blackfish&quot;

This is why you should ever keep an apex Preditor, that God made to hunt, in a freaking swimming pool.

Why are the birds on a giant IPhone?

Ngl I wanted to see a bird explode

They didn&#39;t hunt anything. Just playing with the birds, really.

Thank you for everything Brian! Here’s a little something for you: <a href="">

Egrets, I&#39;ve had a few. But then again, too few to mention ..

Do you mean $lave World huh?

Bird we are not that stupid

Was bait bro 😎
Orca are Beautiful Creatures it&#39;s a shame that No place besides the ocean as big enough to hold these beautiful giants.

Just imagine &quot;you goes to sea world to see whale and whale bait you to get close and eat you &quot;

Why do they always have to blast these beautiful animals with this stupid loud music?

Poor whales in that small pathetic cage, it&#39;s outrageous 😥😥😥

I thought it was going to spit, and knock one in the water...

Orcas are very intelligent

Seaworld is a piece of shit

It amazes even more that animals raised in captivity can develop such high intelligence just by themselves

Yawn

Maybe he wanted to share with his friends lol he doin the httyd thing where toothless hacks up a fish for hiccup 😭😂😂 still tho poor whales get bored maybe they saw park-goers feedin birds snacks and said lemme try that looks fun

Places like Sea world should not exist. Marine mammals are very social and need to swim thousands of miles every year. Orcas in captivity have committed suicide by banging their heads against the tanks repeatedly.People should not visit these horrible places where kids are taught that profits justify animal abuse.

&quot;Come eat some of my fish bird-bros!&quot;&quot;You&#39;ll just kill us.&quot;&quot;Killing is arbitrary.&quot;&quot;Um... no it&#39;s not?&quot;&quot;I call it eating.&quot;

Fish for chicken

Oh wha oh wha you are going for me im gonna take one big backwards knee step

Poor thing :(

&quot;hey guys come a little closer&quot; said the spider to the fly🤔

What a switched on animal just like the honey badger,No wonder white pointers fear  the killers

I heard someone say that the birds can’t eat those big fish? Obviously you don’t know that these birds can eat fish four times bigger than the one laying in front of them!!!!

That&#39;s incredible. So sad seeing them caged up in an environment 140,000,000,000 times smaller than their natural habitat

It&#39;s doing inverse fishing

Killer whales are 10 times smarter than humans

I&#39;d have been much more impressed if he&#39;d gotten one.

For the Orca, that 1 fish is the same as 1 bird. Same quantity of food but it&#39;s the killer instincts that the whale can&#39;t help with.

The Orca: Come here, Georgie...

I&#39;ve had fish every day this week.  I WANT CHICKEN!

Orca : &quot;its simple guys...take this fish and u become my food&quot;

Disgusting a magnificent animal penned up.

This comment section makes me remember why I hate animal &quot;Lovers&quot;

)

I think he is just feeding his buddies.

Doubt he is hunting them, more likely just entertaining himself.  I am sure he is well fed and things get boring in a cage.  They are pretty playful in the wild

cool

The whale is trying to ask the fish to find his family and tell them something either I&#39;m fine or help mw

YouTubers use clickbaitKiller Whale use REAL BAIT

No whale expert here…but if you are an orca tamer…God help you.

Such a beatiful, smart and free creature trapped in a puddle

The whale was thinking and planning, smart creatures.

Okay, so nothing happened..

It’s sad because they’re used to eating bigger things in the wild

Omg the music poor whales I know it makes them crazy sometimes that&#39;s all u hear loud music,,next time u do a video cut the death music off.They not evening performing in the music still plays I see why they drown y&#39;all ..my tiger s get special treatment than this no friends you know whales run in pack

She&#39;s not hunting, just giving an apple pie to the new neighbourgs in the hood...

The Spanish speaker immediately said he&#39;s gonna killem

Hunting or trying to make friends? Maybe looking for amusement because life is too boring in a little tank.

well that was a fucking stupid way to title the video

Cruel

When a birdbrain doesn&#39;t fall for your petty bait skills it&#39;s time to give up lol

This is why sharks

I feel more sympathetic towards the more intelligent animals being kept in enclosures than the wild ones, I really hope they stop with these orca exhibits

Amazing that we keep mammals /porpoise with larger brains and a higher in-tact family rates than us in tiny pools. Similar feeling with great apes, elephants, etc.Imagine how ugly keeping certain animals in a non-rescue/endangered-breeding zoo will be in 50 years, lol.

thats one smart fishie

seaworld should close down

If anyone find this video anything but tragic what&#39;s the matter with you...

That’s amazing. What a smart animal. He offering the fish to the bird. As in bait

<a href="">

My  heart broke evrytime i see an orca in captivity
Fuck it, I&#39;ll eat the damn fish.

Beyond most human intelligence I would say, its very bored.  Orca are in the top three surely and predators as well.

I doubt that orcas are less intelligent than bottlenose dolphins

Bird: I eat fish! So why can&#39;t I accept the tribute of the big black-and-white fish?<b>Gets eaten by big &quot;fish&quot;</b>

Hey Georgie! Do u want a Ballon?

So they won’t survive in the open ocean? Bull shit

Maybe he just wanted to share!

...and  that&#39;s why these magnficent, sentient creatures should never be caged.

This is just sad really sad to see he should be free not like this 😭

These animals need to be freed. Disgusting SeaWorld does this to them. <a href="">#EMPTYTHETANKS</a>

Guy in Spanish in the background &quot;it will kill them&quot;  ehhehehehe

That moment when you wish you had arms

Release these animals into the ocean. Cruel people who pretend to be civilized.
This is fake, the birds are actually paid.

What a shame..people would rather see such an intelligent being in a POOL than to just let them be in their NATURAL habitat 🙄 When will people learn???

good try

When the woman says &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot; is classic proto-vegan behaviour.

....just let him go.

NOTHING HAPPENS

Not only laying bait but chumming as well.

EN LIBERDAD , COMO DEBERIA SER,SU INSTINTO LA LLEVARIA A CAZARLO

Naturally wild despite the human attempt at training it for more human enjoyment

The birds need harpoons

These are not meant to be in captive

If this isn&#39;t a red flag I don&#39;t know what is

its literally fishing, its a water animal using bait to hunt a land/sky animal

When Shamu is tired of Red Lobster and wants KFC....

Those whales DON’T BELONG INTO an aquarium, THEY BELONG INTO THE SEA!! FREE THEM and bring them to a sanctuary!!

I can't help but vomit when I see these beautiful animals locked up! FUCK
It’s almost like he has an Israeli trainer

I keep looking at the white patches around their eyes, thinking it&#39;s the actual eye sockets itself. I keep reminding myself, that&#39;s not where the eyes are, but every time I watch these orca videos, I keep looking at the eye patches cause they look like eyes. Something&#39;s wrong with me. 😅

It was just being nice

&quot;thats gross&quot; - people who watches these shows and thereby supporting this are gross.

They probably do this for their own entertainment given how depressed and bored they are in their prison cages.

They should let him go back to the ocean 🌊

Vet advised Willy to get more poultry in its diet!

Mama told me to never take half eaten fish from a stranger.

&quot;F**ck this fish diet,  I want chikin&#39;!

how incredibly smart !  wow , I wouldn&#39;t have believed it If I hadn&#39;t seen it,  thank you for sharing,  wow , a a whale using bait !

Is this platform is a new upcoming ipad 20?

they want alive fresh food..he whales

No I think if an animal is capable of doing this it shouldn’t be in captivity

Wow they are too smart for their own good. they should not be in captivity!!

Poor animals. We should lock down all so cold ocean worlds where wild lives are locked up doing artificial performance. Shame on you.

F*** sea world.

Should&#39;ve seen what happened to a seagull in the same situation.

Liar
Hes like &quot;come bird take the fish&quot; .

Nothing to see here. Literally a waste of memory.

Spreading fear about nature media. Disgraceful

scary intelligence 😱😱😱 very scary

That orca just wants to hunt. You can tell it has leadership skills

I know I smoke and I&#39;m high right now but is it me or does the thumbnail look as if the whale is by a big ass laptop😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

theyre literally so adorable

They are incredibly intelligent. Do not hold them in jail. Do not support this by paying to see them please people we are in 2021 we are Smart enough to know now days

Poor whale 🐋 was so bored inside that pool. Amazing intelligent animals

The whale is like if you want to be part of the show just take the fish before i change my mind

They are such smart creatures

Dolphin

Sea World are scum

hiro doesn't explain in more detail on b-mobile? ☺️ is
Thats scary!!!

That&#39;s Beluga whale

Another lying clickbait

Does anyone else think the birds are hip to his game?? Lol i love how smart Orcas are. Its actually kinda scary if you think about it. Like now their not allowing certain sized boats to travel thru the straight of gibralter due to a pod or pods of orcas attacking the vessels for some reason. Its documented proof too so its kinda scury lol.

Wow, I thought only serial killers like Ted Bundy are evil and manipulative 🤨…

Nice try. But he was too impatient and the birds knew what he wanted to do.

zoo is a prison for animal

That Orca is like, I will make you my pet!

Cant say “stupid orcas” its not possible

What happens when you mix the size of a whale, the desire for food of a shark and the thinking capacity of dolphins?Orcas, or as i like to call them, Buff Dolphins.

They are so smart.....using new techniques from the wild and using there at SeaWorld

Set the killers free

Shame it has to perform for dumb humans everyday

It’s disturbing to know that they give up fish (their main preference) to eat birds. That just goes to show how badly they are kept from eating the proper amount they need! FREE THEM! If they weren’t captive, people wouldn’t have lost their lives on your account!!!

First 30 seconds I was like wtf is this guy doin? When&#39;s he gonna lunge and grab one? Didn&#39;t realize the fucker was smarter than me and had a better plan.

This kind of smart animals is not supposed to be held in captivity.

Smart birds

It wanted a change in menu so threw up fish that it had swallowed. But then when it realized it is too much of a watse of energy, it retrieved the fish it threw out.Quite energy &amp; efficiency concious. Actually after observing &amp; knowling about animals in the wild (through real wilderness, not just the through TV), I have realized long back, that wild nature &amp; flora-fauna are all energy &amp; efficiency concious at instinctive level, unlike us Humans.

BOYCOTT SEAWORLD!! PRISONS FOR INNOCENT SENTIENT BEINGS!!

Orca: I&#39;m tried of fish, I want some chicken today😂😂

So I take it the orcas don’t like those tiny ass fish they get for preforming, so they save them and use them to catch the the birds .

Isn’t my sister so smart

Let’s face it,   He’s doing what he should being doing if he was out in the ocean …😢  set them free for God sake !!

Amazing orca Hunt
Killer Whale:  If only i had Gene Simmons tongue !

They are like chimps very dangerous and mean not to be messed with- just look how they toss the seals in air out in the wild

Who would be for throwing a live chicken on the water?🙋🏻‍♂️

This poor animal is making up its own entertainment out of sheer boredom. Keeping animals captive like this should be illegal.

Fake news

Orca: nah these birds are too smart, I&#39;ll just take my fish back now and try this trick on a dodo bird 😒

Orca be like: i&#39;m just gonna casually leave this delicious juicy free for the taking fish right here. No strings attached, I swear guys. Birds be like: bro... you just tricked and ate Steve in front of ALL of us literally 10 mins ago.

A COLD CALCULISTIC and DANGEROUS INTELLIGENT ANIMAL.... very dangerous...
she was not hunting birds, she just feed them

It&#39;s not whale it&#39;s dolphin 🐬

Birds didn’t fall for it, Incredible how these orcas can regurgitate their food out of boredom to catch a bird. These birds have become infested at Seaworld so they must see them all day, it’s only natural that they want to kill them.

Whales are not fish they&#39;re mammals who long time ago went to the sea.  They have that mammal way of thinking.

Wale is smart its like a humem in prison youd be amazed with enough time what u come up with

Killer whales are big dolphins cosplaying as penguins change my mind

The poor Orca is just bored!

He&#39;s intelligent
&quot;65 million years ago you hunted me, how the tides have turned&quot;

Remarkable
&quot;where&#39;s Steve?&quot;&quot;I don&#39;t know, now come have some fish&quot;&quot;He was just here an hour ago&quot;&quot;No idea. Aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot;

Do you blame the whale for trying to hunt birds when it&#39;s been forced to eat nothing but tiny sardines I mean they eat seals, sharks, stingrays, dolphins, penguins, and other whales in the wild

Just shows they want more than they are getting, they don&#39;t get taken care of well in these places

&quot;It can&#39;t eat those big ones.&quot; Killer whale: &quot;wanna bet?&quot;

Prison cam
This is heartbreaking!! THey are way too hungry and way too bored. Shut that hellhole down already and let these intelligent animals go to an ocean sanctuary. Pl dont buy a ticket to watch their languishing and suffering.

That is some remarkable intelligence. You&#39;d never think a whale would part from a fish for a meal, but he&#39;s using fish as bait to attract a bigger meal. He actually set a trap. When the birds didn&#39;t fall for it, he attempted to soak their feathers so they&#39;d be too heavy to fly away. When that failed, he just resorted to taking back the fish.

Inhumane....F sea world

Hi lets be friends

Lmao he’s  fishing

Wow was that a click bait title

Nothing here to see.

So sad  Poor whale is so bored he&#39;s messing around with birds Too smart to be locked up for life

Sea world is disgusting and anybody that goes is kind of a prick.

Any how I couldn&#39;t stop admitting that they are super cute😍❤️❤️

Poor things bored af

CNN: Orca gives peace offering to white birds which they racistly refuse

Tastes like chicken.

The Chinese kill all the orca in the wild their lives are saved at sea world

What a smart creature

People on YouTube: “I’m going to make sarcastic comments on this video pretending to role play as the animals do I can get a thumbs up”

Kill it, waste of space

Captivity is a real shame for these animals😨😰😔
Fuck sea world

Dam orcas are smart

&#39;Captured wildlife hunts birds&#39;

Anyone know the Exact &quot;excuse&quot; they use to keep these whales in captivity?....HUGE Oceans that they should be living in and living life...But they get Snatched from Oceans just so these SC*MBAGS can contain them in small areas for MONEY...Will never understand how this type of crap is Legal...The people who ALLOW this should be in prison

Dam geniuses… they really are

Imagine the orcas evolve into mermaids

The whale is like&quot; the man whom my mom used to say  when I was kid that don&#39;t take candies from a strange man he gonna kidnap you 😂😂😂&quot;

SEAWORLD SUCKS

They absolutely need to be set free this just proves it

He’s so cute🥺❤️ he doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him

There’s a vid somewhere on YouTube where the orca actually does get the bird using this trick. Couldn’t believe it when I first saw it

Boycott sea zoos!Intellectual animals hurt there they suffer!!!!

Why People filming a Wähle hunting Birds??? It&#39;s disgusting!!!🤮🤮🤮🤮
They aren&#39;t called &quot;killer whales&quot; for nothing.

Mammals getting revenge on dinosaurs
So humans use bait to catch fish 🎏 and whales use bait to catch bird&#39;s 🤔 interesting 🧐

And we put this intelligence in a <b>****</b> bath tub for years!

Didn&#39;t hunt

Absolutely amazing. Beautiful

Intelligent animal. Awesome. They&#39;re more smarter..

I can’t wait until they’re intelligent enough to start baiting humans that kidnap them from their natural habitat.

Something so intelligent locked in a goldfish bowl 😔

Free the whales

THE GIRLS:18+ ARE <a href="">4UDATE.UNO</a>Youtube: this is fineSomeon: says &quot;heck&quot;Youtube: BE GONEhowever, I love such fishermen++..
Orca: you want fish bro?Birds: <b>suspiciously stare</b>

These beautiful sea wolves should not be put in aquariums to entertain sheeple.

Asshole authors
“Come here nice bird I’ve got some lovely fish to share just need you a bit closer “

They are sooo smart. It’s incredible. 💜

Well played, whale !!

Wtf did I just watch what a waste

The bird doesn&#39;t have more meat, my man is just bored.

The sea&#39;s pennywise

&quot;Clever girl...&quot;
Look at the crossmoon ! Jesus  Christ&#39;s judgement day is coming  very soon!!!Psalms 5015. and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.&quot;  amen

Whale was good

Am I the only one pissed of he didn&#39;t eat a bird👎🏾

Fuck that music

You don&#39;t want none? Aight imma take it back

Even Fish, Fish.. 🎣 lol
They are such intelligent beautiful creatures.

I love how orcas are super smart, but seem to use their intelligence for just 2 things and that&#39;s..A. Family structure/bonds/socialization 2. Murder

People when animals bait other animals to kill em - oh so smartPeople when people bait other people to kill em - bloody idiots, takin other peoples life’s, morons.I dont get it

Just proves that even in captivity they have never lost the instinct to hunt.  They would be able to hunt in the wild if freed

A couple hundreds of thousands of years and you will find this guys fighting you for the land

&quot;Clever girl...&quot;
Bro most humans can’t even do that. I mean seriously could you just puke up food on command to use as bait? I have never seen humans do that. That is insane.

one day kill somebody...these animal are not childrenplay....

Bruh lemme see him eat one

This video is like how a fake friendship works. The predator shows you that their a good person and when you get to trust them, they stab you in the back.

That&#39;s actually amazing. That whale was using bait.

With humans totally fishing out there natural prey we&#39;ll see alot more of this! Including attacks on humans!

This poor female Orca is captivated and suffering mentally and physically which makes my heart shatter to pieces because this company won’t stop there Goddamn stupid business

Orcas are smart as hell. I’d bet this one can drive

Fuck Seaworld

So sad, fuck sea world

This is why orcas are the apex predator. They are so god damn smart jt is amazing

<b>takes it&#39;s fish back</b>
How do we know he was hunting? Because the title told us?

These animals are not whales they are dolphin related.

Fear is keeping us safe 😂😂😂😂😂😂

The orca is making friends must be bored to death in the aquarium 😊

It&#39;s so sad to see such a beautiful mammal kept in captivity and forcibly taken from their natural environment.  I bet that stupid music drives them insane!!

Orcas are eerily similar to humans😈

So damn intelligent. Dumb people that dont understand lol.

fuck sea world

6

Why do we assume it was hunting?

He&#39;s not very good :(Lost 1 fishy

Lol he was “fishing”

Reverse fishing? (I know its not a fish)

Ahhh! The old &quot;bait me with a fish then devour me&quot; trick.

Screw these places keeping these intelligent creatures in captivity. Please consider boycotting them

&quot;I offer you this fish...&quot;&quot;Oh thanks whale I-&quot;&quot;... in exchange for your life&quot;

Sad for so many reasons

The bird was smarter for not falling for it.

Worst kind of click bait.

Sad

How about instead of forcing whales to do tricks..... upgrade their pool and give them live fish to hunt and eat (if they can kill birds, I’m pretty sure they can kill a dumb fish

Poor thing, this doesn&#39;t even come close to the real hunting it would do in the wild.

Amazing
any one else disappointed because the orca didn&#39;t get the bird?

I was hoping to see them get caught

Whale doesn&#39;t belong into a pool! Free Willy!

These beyond beautiful ❤️ animals stuck in that tiny tiny god forsaken hell hole    They are so intelligent..   And that dreadful music 🎵.. It drives me mad after just a couple of minutes...

The people saying they should be in the will yes they should maby if people stop killing them and making them go extinct the could stay in the wild

&quot;You want this fish? But you gotta COME INSIDE! &quot; I HATE Sea World still.

Do they feed the poor whales enough food.

Disgusts me that these amazing creatures are kept in captivity. There should be laws against this stuff

&quot;Something sounds fishy&quot;- the birds, probably

Probly his only friends stuck in that tank!

Fuck sea world.

Set him free
This is how banks work
These poor Intelligent creatures. Trap in a cell their whole life. Even if they were born there, their instincts tell them there&#39;s more and they remain unhappy their entire life.. it&#39;s heart breaking

Its not cute or funny. These animals are hunting because they are HUNGRY and thats SO CRUEL.

They are so smart. Should be using all that intelligence in the ocean, free, where they belong

How intelligent is the orca, my God?
This place should be burned ... stop animal cruelty !!

He&#39;s starvingDo humans like to see caged and starving animals, in tormentHumans are just too cruel

That&#39;s so smart how he used the fish

That 🐳 is smart he was offering 🐟 to them with the hopes the get close to the edge so he could ambush that’s intelligent

successfully wasted <a href="">1:34</a> minutes

Its so sad...

I thought crows were the only animals that understood the concept of baits

Eeeeeee birdie birdie birdie om nom nom nom <b>burps</b>
He&#39;s like take these fish and go tell my pod to rescue me

Kinda scary when i realized what he is doing was very intellectual...

It’s amazing how people still support animal cruelty

Libertad

Smart

Intelligent for sure
Stuck all it&#39;s life in a 12 by 10 concrete pool

These animals are not for captivity. Free them all.

Orc doesnt want to be fed. It wants to hunt...

Such a shame to stock these animals in a bathtubThey are not actually killers

April 2021

How many orcas are still being tortured at sea world?

Just put the thing back in the ocean... Simple

Orca was hungry and wanted something new on the menu.

Aw how cute

Here, Birdy Birdy!!!

FUCK SEA WORLD

Birds deserve some credit who knows how many times the orca has pulled off this baiting . if u put me in a swimming pool for the rest of my life in gonna start killing birds then move to humans .

They should give them more food

And a human feels comfortable getting in the tank with one of those cunning Beasts? 😳

I have seen them do it in the wild, very cunning and intelligent

They might have fallen for it but you was 😏 the whole time.  Like these birds are soo dumb this will be easy. 😆

Keeping these beautiful creatures in captivity is a crime against humanity and nature. They should be free in the ocean, not imprisoned all their lives.

IT: Sea World.

I hope, he could return his ocean someday.

So this video is just a fish bait😧

Orca&#39;s don&#39;t belong in this tiny pool red

Proof that they are very smart...

Every one should watch the documentary, “Black Fish.” You’d never go to sea world again.

🐋 : come, I have got some good for you 🤤Birds: no thanks, we are independent, we can get our own food 😏 I know you well

Did anyone else think the birds were standing on a huge laptop?

To bad they can&#39;t throw in some seals or something to give them some entertainment

It&#39;s  because he&#39;s  bored...in a frikin swimming pool...orcas don&#39;t  belong in captivity!!!

Someone here in 2021?

It should have allowed the birds to eat one or two of the fish free and clear then pounce.

So cute

All wales should live in the wild nature

When you tired of fish and just want some chicken 🐔

Such a beautiful creature should be free

Apparently in the wild they&#39;ve been known to regurgitate fish to let it float to the water&#39;s surface to lure birds as well.

zoos are depressing. it should be illegal. parks and sanctuaries are all good but zoos are just animal jail.

Fun fact killer whales actually used to be called whale killers because they killed whales but the name was eventually flipped. They are actually part of the dolphin family

This is why these beautiful Orcas should not be imprisoned in these SeaWorld torture parks. Born to hunt, born to be free.Shame on you SeaWorld.😡

This is terrifying but amazing

My r

<a href="">0:14</a> omg one side is like &quot;omg look he&#39;s feeding the birds so cute&quot;, while the other side is &quot;Yup They Are Going To Kill Them&quot; 😂😂😂

...and he settled for the bait that day.

This is really a great video! But let&#39;s have a real talk: <b>NOBODY SEARCHED FOR THIS</b>

These godawful places need to be shut down and orcas belong in the ocean

Fuck captivity. Fuck anyone who supports that shit

It needs chicken

This one is too impatient, unlike the whale that used the same trick in another video and succeeded.

I think people are more focused on the orca using bait instead of focusing on how the orca learned to use bait, how it knew the birds liked fish and how it knew to sit and wait. Orcas have just as much intelligence as humans, if not more. They&#39;re perfectly designed animals. Humans are not. The fact a single orca could upset an entire ecosystem in a positive way,  while hundreds of humans can literally destroy entire forests is why the science community is so hesitant to call animal vocalization &quot;languages&quot;. Those languages aren&#39;t meant for us to understand and its only human hubris that causes us to think other animals couldn&#39;t possibly be smart

&quot;Where is he getting the fish from???&quot; <b>turns and spits one out in her direction</b>

Whales are still smarter than the Prime Minister. My country???
Soo cuteee

“Clever girl,” - Robert Muldoon

The whale was just sharing his food but apparently the bird is vegan.

<b>&quot;Clever girl&quot;</b>
You know that an animal is intelligent and has a motive if they ever leave good food instead of eaiting it.

You eat my food since you are my food...

It looks to me like he was putting on a show just like his trainers do he was throwing them the fish expecting them to do tricks

The &quot;up next&quot; video is... You know...

Perfect place.. It's so beautiful 😍😍😍LYNZWIERSGLS
Poor thing should be actually hunting birds and seals fish in the ocean where it belongs

CrappyShitWhere the attack Click crap

Stupid whale. If it was smart he wouldn&#39;t have got caught.

Plot twist - it was trying feed those birds 😂

I feel bad for animals in captivity just leave them alone in their natural habitat

They should free these animals 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
What an amazingly intelligent animal.

&quot;Hi friends! Want some fish? Tasty fish right here!&quot; &quot;What&#39;s with all the teeth?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s just a friendly smile!&quot;

11 years old, still has video quality top notch.

Poor whale

What if we actually underestimate them? What if they have an adaptation system just like humans, from cage to sea...are they going to be this clever?

Just more proof predators need live prey to satisfy their instincts

This is why I think evolution is a hoax, charles darwin said that we came from a high intellect evolved chimp and now we are here, and these smart aquatic titans never had a natural threat to its existence, been living for thousands maybe millions of years and could not evolve to a more complex species??

Whale just says: We float down here

The sad thing are the people that pay money to see this creature which keeps it in captivity. This creature does not belong there. It is a very sad sight.

Wickedly too damn smart.

That bait was a bit fishy

This is the real jailhouse Bob right here.

These orcas dont get enough credit fornhow smart they are

Maybe he just trying to be nice.

Hes like f this fish i need some real meat.

Seaworld of hurt he hunt bird cause hungry in seaworld orca forced to perform tricks. If they dont do trick they wont given any food thats why he hunt the bird

Incredibly intelligent and there home is the ocean

and then they    they cant survive in the wild   well now i know its an bullshit word  THEY can survive in the wild  this is proof

Only stupid people forget that they are apex predators.

This is how  Stock market works

<a href="">#emptythetanks</a>
Click bait
Yeah, that’s basically a person

When you see things like this, it does make you question the whole&#39; they wouldnt survive in the wild&#39; statements. I think captive animals are intelligent enough to be taught how to hunt.

Because Seaworld says they keep these massive animals in their own toilet bowls because they lost their survival instincts and can’t survive in the wild.

That music is terrible.

Hehe let&#39;s all be friends, here&#39;s your stimulus check.

&quot;Mission failed. We&#39;ll get em next time.&quot;
Now that&#39;s what you called &quot;reverse fishing&quot;.

I didn’t see him “hunt” anything he was feeding them.

All animals  are smart

To be that intelligent and locked in a small cell for life must be hell on earth.

That&#39;s awesome

YouTube recommend me after 7yrs Wow beautiful video

Birds like yea all ight

Why some birds are so dumb? Like pigeons, they know about the cars but still going to the middle of the street and die ;-;

They are extremely intelligent animals.

Sea world trained killers

He was on the hunt but he didn&#39;t get the prize.

Pioneer females taking kids to watch depressed beautiful animals suffer like this, absolutely disgusting, no strong WOMEN there then..

Those birds were not having it

Aww poor whale, I honestly don&#39;t think they&#39;d survive &quot;in the wild&quot;...

Poor thing. Free willie.

You know you want the fishy mr bird, it&#39;s right there take it

Sad something so intelligent lived in captivity.

A lot of people don&#39;t know that this is actually the king of the ocean

He or She hunting birds for a reason, orca dont want to eat ONLY fish, that these flaers feed it.

The beauty
You tryed but you failed

I wonder how often whales in captivity do this.

The orca is bored af.  They are natural predators and he or she is definitely well fed.  Orca was hunting for sport

They should never never be imprisoned like this....

Well, no wonder they’re hunting birds if all they get fed are dead fish! Everyone knows orcas don’t eat dead things! They’re hunters, not scavengers! And only one type of orca eat fish, Type C! All the others hunt seals, dolphin and whales! No wonder they’re going mad in there if they’re not being fed properly, that’s like giving a lion a lettuce! 🤦‍♀️

This video just waste my 2minutes bruh,is not even interesting at all

Animals using 🔧
Imagine if these guys could record information for future generations. Pencil and paper sir?

Empty the tanks 😔

Everybody on here talking about how orcas shouldn&#39;t be in captivity, <b>have you seen what these things are doing to ecosystems around the world?</b> the arctic for instance, multiple nurseries for narwhal have been butchered by a new group of orcas invading the arctic not to mention they kill anything and everything the only reason they dont hunt and kill us is because apparently we taste bad.

How bored is that whale

Orcas want meat. I doubt they are being fed anything other than fish. Put a seal in there and im almost positive they&#39;ll gone insane.

Cake !!
It’s absolutely fucking disgusting how people keep animals like this in captivity. Who supports this should be locked up for animal cruelty 😡

Hes not good at it.

He is boring and just playing

Hes fishing

it&#39;s really really SLY😎😎😎

Well they ain’t called “killer whale” for nothing!

There always seems to be enough “rescues” to keep the seaworlds in business.That whale looks like it could survive just fine.

Damn I must have missed the part where he was hunting the bird all I saw was him playing

Killer whales hunting birds pal you need to give up your lighter and stop smoking all that funny weed in this video I saw nothing of a hunt nothing of a kill I merely saw a beautiful whale feeding lunch to his friendly bird type friends.    🤯🤯🤯🤯😷

This was very well orcastrated

how alive these bugs!!! of not believing what nature is
There&#39;s no way these birds will allow themselves to get caught...places fish right by the corner ...oh i see where this is going

Poor Whale

Its the equivalent of hey little kid you want some candy its in my van

Yeah I&#39;m more of a chicken guy too

This Orca deserve an Oscar

Ah shit I thought he would eat one of those chickens

An orca tried to do this to my bird main luckily I&#39;ve watched Tierzoo

And that&#39;s why you never take candy from a stranger

Surprisingly it looks like the birds won this battle !

When they take &quot;you looking like a snack to a whole new level&quot;

Thats hiw hungry they are starved so they listen to there trainer in return for a bit of fish and the trainer thinks its love. They whole set up is sick

Click bait
Apex predator no doubt
Free them all.

Nice try

Their intellegence is scary, and amazing at The same time

Use the fish to get the bird, use the bird to get the timber wolf, use the Timberwolves to catch the polar bear.... mmmmmmm bear meat.

This was extremely well Orcaestrated!

They should be free fuk sea world

“Here birdie birdie birdie... I share fishie!”
Bird cruelty
&quot;giving a little to get big &quot; genius orc investor

Selfish birds spoiling our entertainment...

They are not killing whales, they name is Orcas. They&#39;re more like Dolphins and they don&#39;t attack unless you bother them.

Killer insticts never fades. No matter how they are trained.

Never accept a fish from an orca

fuck sea worlds

There is a video where a orca was able to bait a bird close enough to snatch him. They are crazy smart.

The animal kingdom&#39;s equivalent to a &quot;free candy&quot; van

Temptation will be the death of those birds.

Orca: Here birdies birdies birdies! Bon appetite!
Smart

Ita fucking disgraceful that these magnificent, highly intelligent mammals are forced to spend their lives in a tiny tank.

Nothing happens. Turn off right away

They shouldn’t be in a tank... I hope they eat the trainers

We most kill the killer whale because she will evolution

Amazing
You see this is what they should be doing to get food “hunting” not performing a few tricks just to get some dead thawed out fish thrown at them. It’s this hunting and using coordination along with other members of their pod that will keep them active both physically and mentally instead of just acting out the same monotonous tricks over and over again with no new stimulation to prevent boredom and keep them from learning new skills constantly like they would in their natural habitat. Keeping these creatures like this is just every form of wrong imaginable, a 5 year old can see this is just cruel! The statistics say it all with how many of these magnificent creatures becoming seriously ill and dying in captivity within just a small amount of time, some even commit suicide by smashing themselves into the pool sides! Sea world knows exactly how unhappy these animals are but don’t give a toss as long as the spectators keep paying at the turnstiles, how can anything be happy that’s been torn away from its family, had family members murdered in front of it then held in the equivalent of a 6ft x 6ft cage for the rest of their now shortened life with complete strangers from other families (whom they might not socially get along with) who can’t communicate with you in the same dialect as your other family members could! It makes me so angry at how obviously sick and twisted this practice is but yet it still goes on, we learn nothing from them worth learning keeping them like this and should just study, watch and enjoy their natural behaviour from afar and be happy knowing they’re happy being who they are and doing what they do as nature intended! Rant over for now!

Kasatka or Orkid?

Let them go sea world you cruel fucks!!!!

When a Fish uses Fish to Fish you know you done messed up <b>BIG TIME</b>

That is s animal that is thinking... that is awesome

How cool ! They can spit food out thats amazing

Lol that whale was talking shit when the fish was set down!

Sad that they live in containment

Wow!!

The sheer intelligence of these orcas is honestly astounding. Leaving a fish for bait, moving away to make the bird feel safer with the distance so it would get the fish, jumping onto the platform to try and catch the bird. And yet, they are stuck in captivity. How cruel.

Awww he wants to hunt so bad 😢 Orcas in captivity has to end.

When the hunter needs fresh meat and needs to use hunter skills. Can you imagine how sad if for these inteligent animals to live in a cage...

bird: thatsbait.gif

Honestly, Zoos and aquariums are just cruel. The only case where it is acceptable would be in order to save a species from extinction, which is another problem caused by humans and animals suffer because of it. When I was younger, my family and I went to an aquarium in france every year (back when you still had that childish wonder) and they had two tiger sharks in a way too small tank. For years on end, these sharks had to swim in a fucking circle barely bug enough for them to pass each other. That&#39;s cruel torture and it just shows how sick the human race is for enjoying watching other living beings be stripped off their freedom.

And now we wonder why Orcas are deliberately attacking fisher boats.

No wonder why orca is the apex predator

I’m now convinced that orcas have a GTA style weapon wheel in their stomachs

Poor guy 🌊🥺🌊
1st: earn their trust

Killer whale  so intelligent imagine if it have leg

fuck sea world boycott that shit they don’t want to eat dead things to the point they are using what they feed to eat actuall alive things

Shut The aquarium down free the animals discussed to  watch that .. people stop going to Those places

I don&#39;t know why, but when I look at this it reminds of the scene in Spirited Away when No-Face kept offering gold to Chihiro and she wasn&#39;t tempted and left.

Highly intelligent animals.

Orcas freak me out the way they Hunt in coordinated packs with tactics and every moron thinks they&#39;re these gentle giants. The wolfs in sheepskin of the ocean

Orca: i&#39;m dolphin i&#39;m dolphin, came here..
Too intelligent to be scary
no birds where hurt making this video unfortunately

Sometimes u have to sacrifice small things to achieve big things in life

Poor beast
Idk who is smarter, the whale or the birds

i dont even know where he is getting the fish is he storing it in his tummy

Bird 1: Hey umm Bob, it kinda looks fishy to me....

Enough of the fish, i want chicken

At the end he was like &quot;You don&#39;t want it? Fuck you then, I&#39;ll just take it back and eat it.&quot; LolBut it&#39;s truly sad how theu are being kept like this. And people get surprised when they get fed up and plan to kill their trainers and handlers.

Hopefully they learn to hunt humans

The mark of evolution is when an animal or insect employs natural resources as tools or, in this case, bait.  Good thing Orcas don&#39;t have thumbs.

clickbait, here&#39;s the real hunting one: <a href="">

The first fish is to encourage the prey ,  the second one is to trap ..

Orca&#39;s are very intelligent. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve gathered from this video. Not many creatures on our planet use bate to luwer in pray.

That was extremely well  orcastrated

This is addictive to watch!I wish there was a whole series of Orca wild and captive  hunting strategies in action!Orcas are intelligent beyond comprehension.I wonder what they would tell us if we could communicate?They know life secrets we can’t even imagine to be possible!

Misleading title

Orcas are OP

Poor orca crying out in distress at being locked up alone. He offers a fish to the herons who are afraid to approach. Look how he cries for his loneliness.. It hurts my heart.
&quot;They can&#39;t eat those big ones&quot; this guy is ill experienced in egrets, herons, and cranes xD this is fascinating to watch!

In this video, Willy is successful:<a href="">

It's a shame about all this, what a disgusting human being...
This was well orchestrated..... 🐋

Out of all animals it’s kinda sad when a huge ass whale is in captivity

A bit anticlimactic but cool

I want chicken!! Not Fish Damit. Said the Orca.

He’s literally talking to the bird saying “you know you want this fishy fish dish, I promise I wrong bite you my friend” meanwhile the birds thinking, “I saw what you too did to Marty, where’s Marty?”

It’s amazing but it’s sad that it’s happened omg in sea world and not in the ocean

Disliking only because this video means someone went to Sea World and provided further profit to those in charge of keeping these clever, beautiful creatures in ridiculously unfit conditions.
