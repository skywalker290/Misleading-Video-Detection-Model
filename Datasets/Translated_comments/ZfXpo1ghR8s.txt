yashaswini dayma is love😍😍netflix pin this comment.
Watched only Abhay deol❤

Netflix please NEVER take this movie off your platform. It’s one of my favorites.

Amazing!! I watched this movie because of Abhay Deol. All the actors do amazing work but Yashaswini is lit 🤟🏻 the character.First i come here to watch trailer &amp; then i come for comment about this movie.The movie content is really good if you want to watch a movie that calm your mind &amp; feeling good.Teenager must be like ❤️If you are thinking to watch the movie Just go for it ~

What are the odds that a guy like  u would  WANNA HANG OUT  WITH  ME ?

That day was special

For abay deol
Neflix the most pretentious ott in India right now.

The lead actress is so annoying

Movie is good.. Watch it.. But i wish song played in the movie should havr been uploaded in the youtube..it would have been much much better

Where can I find this movie??

Abhay was sooo charming in this movie ❤️✨

this movie is so good . 💞

this movie is so underrated 😭💞

Monica❤️
It&#39;s a great movie. Don&#39;t look any further, just watch it! 🙌

It looks like a copy of the end of the fucking world.

Did any one understood the story of the movie? Please koi samjha do yaar

Netflix 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
Netflix ke jai ho mujy be koi movie m ly lo g

Give this man more roles...

OOOOOO OOOOOO OOOOOO music in trailer and Bollywood thinks it becomes Hollywood. LOL......

I didnt get this movie? Can someone explain what was it about?

Great movie...great work 😝✌calm thing

Watched it loved it ❤️

I really love to watch Abhay Deol.He is one of the most inspiring actor in bollywood

Abhay deol is a heritage filmy man,, his father&#39;s movie maa and he loves his mom, I want to say one thing to Abhay deol, we do cap lamp issue in munidih colliery on Abhay construction name, Are you Abhay construction?

Y&#39;know I always thought Abhay Deol was super cute. Like I even found him cuter than Hrithik Roshan in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara even though Hrithik Roshan is thought to be the handsomest man in India. Abhay Deol, if you ever read this, I love you and I think you are absolutely amazing! &lt;3

<a href="">0:57</a> Isn&#39;t that old lady from whatsapp ad??

Abhay deol😊😊Gonna watch it Simple.Such a natural and talented actor.Watched his every movie. Manorma 6 feet under, to dev D to Ahista Ahista to Socha na tha and all.Superb.Seems he fits <a href="">everywhere.So</a> classy in script selection.Maybe underrated but certainly not a derby horse

Will watch it for Monica Dogra, my love.

i am here after watching movie.  i liked this movie

Hey You!!! YouYes youYou are Perfect❤

Really loved this movie. Almost feels like a slice of life anime.

Need more content with Abhay Deol. He is a gem.

These people have made comments about Abhay Deol, I know that I have not seen any movie or I don't know anyone that I have watched the movie, they just leave comments on YouTube as per their liking, the most underrated actor. blah blah blah
<a href="">

Such a cute movie ❤️😍
Abhay deol😍😍😍😍
This time only for telent not reference Actors,  Aby deol related with Bollywood Family but hi is best talented actor ever .so from this time I am Going to watch his movies always,  only talented actor my list not fucking Movie mafiya and bijann..RIP susan Sir but you are winner

This is a really good movie! I read somewhere that someone compared its style to that of Wes Anderson and honestly, I cannot find a better description than that. It is the best adaptation of Wes Anderson&#39;s eccentric motifs in a relatively original, Indian format.

<a href="">

<a href="">

Superb trailer..Abhay rocks.
Abhay Deol most underrated actor with so natural acting skill.

Socha na tha,Dev d ,manorama, oyelucky, ek chalis ki last local all his movies are amazing he needs to do more movies Bollywood wake up

looks amazingggg . Waiting

i’m in love. with this movie, with the soundtrack, with the aesthetic. and i’d be lying if i said that this isn’t one of the best movies i’ve watched in a long, long time. ♥️

i just watched this movie and just wanna let y’all know that it’s the prettiest movie i’ve watched in a long, long time

This movie is soooooo good......like soooo good I&#39;m not even exaggerating....

Thank you netflix giving chance to one of the best indian actor. Wish he will reach the wider audience from this.

Good music!!💯
Where can i see it...?

This movie is beautiful

Better than befikre 💞

This movie is so lighthearted and refreshing. I justed wish for more movies like this :)

Very fresh movie boy boy,sir sir

Direction reminds me of Wes Anderson movies.

Abhay deol. Missed you so badly...

Abhay is my favourite actor,infact most sensible actor..

When will netflix start hosting relatable content god knows 🤦🏻‍♂️
I love abhay deol an the choices he makes 🙈😍🥰

Zero stars,don&#39;t waste your time on this.

Really wished this was a show

What Babaseer has created?
No subtitles... Netflix, small things matter! I heavily sell Indian content to my non-Indian friends. Though this trailer is mostly in English, it does make them lose interest as the Hindi is not translated.

Defuq I just saw
The movie doesn&#39;t make any sense....its just all random stuff and thats y i liked it😃

Abhay Deol my fav actor ❤️His acting is pure and original ❤️❤️
What are the odds that we&#39;ll like this?

what are the odds that this movie makes sense to anyone !

Excellent actor
Literally Loved the movie!!!&lt;3

Abhay Deol Super Star of Indie Cinema !

Looks like an Indian version of an American romance drama series. Please get more original than this

Indian Wess Anderson 😂

Anyone who thinks this is copied, seriously, watch the movie. It&#39;s refreshing.

What are the odds if it is the remake of end of the f**ing world...!!!!

Abhay deol most underrated actor..Always comes up with fresh content..❤️

What is the name of the web series?
can someone give me the song link?

Y favourite actor abhay deol
Just saw this movie. Couldn&#39;t continue after 30 minutes. Banane wale ko khud pata tha ki wo kya bana raha h?? Such a waste of time and money.

Netflix please put out the songs !! They are beautiful

<a href="">0:18</a> gilly suit🤣🤣 like if you are a pubg lover👇👇👇
Abhay Deol is one of the best natural actor of Bollywood industry and this subject is gonna rock because of Abhay Deol if someone have doubt then watch his ( DEV D)movie or any you want you will see a great natural talent.

Not a abhay deol movie , abay is only for like a anchor type role , I don&#39;t like movie 10/2.

Must watch .. i just finished it off. The  best ever web series so far .. it will blow ur mind and make u feel in diffrent world .. highly recommended.. well done abhay sir ..

what is the name of the song ???

Dwarves are getting noticed as artists after &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. How many of you agree...?

Abhay Deol👌🏼
It&#39;s not Netflix indiaIt&#39;s Netflix English fully English

The combo isssaaa giving vibeeeeě :))))!!<b>*aaaaaaaaahhhhh*</b>@netflixindia u should see my COMMENT!

please tell me the red sweats are not a royal tenenbaums homage..

Finally abbay doel

Its similar to the end of the fucking world 🤔

The Odds are log(p/(1-p)) !!!

What are the odds full movie 

Full movie what are the odds 

only here for abhay deol

I just finished watching the film abhay is just awful I mean come on you can&#39;t go from oye lucky lucky oye to this man come on the story was awful dude plz bring back the old magical abhay we loved and admired very very dissapointed

I see Abhay Deol, I click Like.

This girl is acting great... we admire her...
Why the cinematography is giving me little bit of Wes Anderson vibes. Do not take this for criticism, this is love.

Finally something Fresh!!

good to see abhay deol back on screen 🙏

DIrector, Music Composer, Lyricist, Background Score, Edit, Cinematography by NETFLIX INDIA No need of technician

There are some trailers like Housefull 3 and I know that I am not going to watch it ever...There are some trailers like Patal Lok and I know that it has to be definitely watchedand then there are some trailer like this and you can&#39;t predict that how it will be

😃

@Netflix India justice for AK Stupid
Your comment gets pinned only when &#39;Odds are in your favour&#39; 😉

<b>Nefflix, make a Play Date version for Abhy Deol!</b>

<b>*my first favourite artist 🎨🎭 </b><b><a href="">#Abhaydeol</a></b><b>.*</b>
Netflix is buying everything just to get benefited

Why does this kinda give me end of the fucking world vibes?

I think its an indian version of End of the fuck**g world

Abhay deol my favourite actor
Kainy

This movie is just like The End of the F***ing World
It would have been better if the movie was in Hindi. One more thing, make a movie based on the story of any other city other than Mumbai.
Another poorly reviewed series...Netflix India can’t give good shows

Abhay Deol we want to see ur more work.

Feel good wali koi web series bta do yr.... suspense thriller bahut dekh liya...

<a href="">1:07</a> what&#39;s that kid doing 😆😆

Anyone getting the vibe of Wes Anderson? Or it is just me. :)

Seems very interesting

50% comment about abhay deol25% comment about yashvani25% comment about gilli suit <a href="">0:18</a>

I wasted my time by watching this very week script,plot and acting too. Netflix India is a garbage box and it contains very poor movies like this

Seen the movie Very very very disappointed 👎👎👎

One more disaster
Liked for abhay deol

I like abhey deol voice

Odd or stranger&#39;s

Copy of End of the Fucking World

Yashaswini fan from phobia🍀

It is a disaster. I wasted my 1.32 hours on it.

Liked before watching.Love DEOL...

Yashaswini Dayama is Favorite 💕💕
One day coming generation will say that this generation has underestimated Abhay Deol&#39;s acting

Others:Great contentPub g players: why is he wearing a gilli suit(<a href="">0:17</a>)

Hollywood is feeling... Nice..Bollywood is also now moving out of its so called typical love triangle concept..
Seeing Abhay Deol always brings a smile on my face☺️
<a href="">

Please don&#39;t release it ... Better to scrap it.

Ye netto release.havent slept 19/20 may

What a boy did you make?
Tik rating decrease by 2.6 ... <i>__From 4.6 stars to 2 stars only_</i> 💪😎

I&#39;m loving the whole &#39;Wes Anderson&#39;  style of directing!

Hope to see Dharmendra, Sunny, Bobby and Abhay deol together in a movie...

I think this is shot in Pune. And Pune looks beautiful.

Same Content Netflix Ka please bring something New !

Abhay sir we want to see you more and more 😍😍😘😘

And when u really wants to see acting , turn to web series rather than Bollywood drama ..

Yashawani in Dice Media&#39;s &quot;Adulting&quot; and her! Completely opposite

As always... Bollywood actors can only do shitty love story drama... This is their aukaat!

Ray i love your acting...
wooow I like it

bohot hi fuzool. The only attraction is Abhay Deol

Brother who likes this movie please like it
Looking forward for it.

Have no Idea what&#39;s Netflix is making. Best wishes with this series.

Who all see gillie suit....<a href="">#pubg</a> for life😊

It&#39;s gonna be a hit . I can say the casts are really good and Abhay is cherry on top. Best of luck

Reply brother

Purely The END OF FU##<a href="">#NG</a> WORLD VIBES 😅🙄

What does it look like to keep a Hindi title?
Whoa this looks amazing! And it&#39;s coming out tomorrow!!!

Alert - Violence at <a href="">0:33</a>You know what i mean

No trailer yet out on netflix?Also can&#39;t find it out on the app

Why am I getting too much &quot;The end of the f*cking world&quot; Vibes??

It&#39;s good that Netflix India casts Abhay Deol but still, the role he gets doesn&#39;t take out his full caliber. Chopsticks was an okay movie but it&#39;s not enough.

Puri 8 govt jobs hai<a href="">
India&#39;s very &#39;End of the fucking world&#39;-ish show. Even cinematography is similar

Yeh Airtel wali ladki hai kya?

Paatal lok review-<a href="">
What are the odds?Ans: How about looking at male to female ratio?

Nice <a href="">#darkridexx</a>

What kind of taste are you making?


Why does that other actor look like Sunny Deol&#39;s son though?? Abhay must&#39;ve been startled. 😂😂

YouTube vs tiktok  <a href="">

dislikes are from PUBG fans?

Hey @Netflix India,Now that&#39;s more like it!!

Boredddddq

Netflix is goodBut Netflix india sucks..

Yashaswini is the best

We love you Abhay Deol
<a href=""> j kise ne plan free krna hove ehh vedio vekho
And Now netflix is promising some good indian web series after scared games...

Abhay Deol is back. And with Yashaswini tooTime to renew my subscription. 😎

Abhay deol  👍👍
Yashashwini ..💜 One of the finest talent out there !!I&#39;m glad she&#39;s getting more roles

The best Deol 🖤

I don&#39;t like Yashaswini at all.. what are the odds?

If abhay deol is there then i am watching it because you do learn something from his film <a href="">#ZNMDFAN</a>

Abhay Ji hai dekna banta hai no doubt he will be the best.
Bakwaas...trying to be American.

Ye to ZNMD wala he

&quot;End of the fu**ing world&quot; copied.

Whoever is managing Netflix India youtube channel, You are lit🔥🔥🤣🤣

He is the best Deol ever happened to that family...

Only and only for Abhay Deol ❤️

Abhay Deol 😍

I can even watch a poster of abhay D 😍🤓

At the moment I see Abhay Deol on the thumbnail, smile comes to my face. He is so cute.

@Netflix India , This looks like an Indian rip-off of The End of the Fu**in world. I guess it is the end now when independent platform start making same content from different versions. Haha. The one and only thing sellable anout this whole trailer is one and only Abhay Deol. (The only Deol who knows acting well)

<a href="">1:07</a> will make you smile

Netflix se achha content to tvf wale banate hai fuddu saale

What are the odds of me living a completely different life from what I am currently living with insecurity, anxiety, uncertainty. And also finding my true love which doesn&#39;t exist!PS I do have a boyfriend! This is self talk personally on a public platform. Yay. Okay Bye.

Netflix on a mission to westernise India.

Ise Tik tok pe release kar do. Shayad ek aadh janwar dekh le.

Where did you get the Gilli suit?
Had to watch this <a href="">1:30</a> minute trailer also...Abhi is sad.
Great to see Dev D back after such a long time...really an actor...hot hero!

Abhay DeolJimmy ShergillRandeep HoodaAre the most underrated actors

Netflix Indian content... Fingers crossed 🤞
Abhay Deol never disappoint us
whatever it takes, that&#39;s always worth it :)<a href="">#TechyBrains</a>

Is this not &#39;the end of the fucking world&#39;?

Brother, bring good content and don't waste it on @Netflix.
Like for Ray

Am I the only one getting Wes Anderson vibes here ? Like semi Wes vibes ?

Going to watch this only for abhay deol.. underrated superstar..😎

<a href="">

Anybody remember KANTABAI
<a href="">#UNDERRATEDabhay</a> love u bhai..
Netflix India show all of its creativity in replying to the youtube comments only.

<a href="">#abhaydeol</a> is most finest actor in this era it&#39;s simplicity and the dialogue delivery it&#39;s too good....

Some one tell what is the meaning of Ood...?

Whats the name of this song??

Long live it
No subtitles, come on
Good to see Abhay ji deol ..very underrated actor of Bollywood

Finally he come back

Writers ke bhi credits add kara karo Netflix wale/i Bhaiya/didi

Could this be inspired by &quot;The End of the F***ing World&quot; by any chance? Loner boy meets outsider girl. Idiosyncratic and disfunctional yet very new age Indian. Feels kinda fresh overall.

Answers to many questions in the film<a href="">
Trailer look end of the funking world series

What are the odds that it is going to be in my next binge-list!!

&quot;End of the fucking world&quot; ki vibes aa rahi hai

Long live 🔥❤
Simple life with great stories

real deol.......abhay deol. Actor who is far better than all khans,except Irfan khan.

If you haven&#39;t watched oye lucky lucky oye movie of abhy deol than dont watch them go first watch this movie

If Life gives you &#39;Deol&#39;You already knows.......

idk man
You had me at Abhay Deol.

Finally Lucky and Bangali is back 👍

I think movie was made by stoners.😂😂

What is this 💩 that Bollywood people are showing to the public these days?
Aise trailer bahut boring hote h yar &amp; movie also
Looks like a wes anderson inspired movie. Hope it will be as good.



Is the actress that played Kantaben in Kal Ho Naa Ho in this movie?

Ye real UFO h? <a href="">

Seems...that this part of India is situated in the heart of retro west...

No lockdown for Netflix

Brother, have you got time pass yet? Let's see the planning for the next few days.
Anyone noticed the gillie suit 😅😅

The amt. of kachra netflix produces oh gosh!

kaafi Hollywood wali feel A rhi h.seems pretty Nice And Sweet series.

They are trying to make pg version of end of the fucking world Even they copied that i conic wood scene But i hope it&#39;s going to be great Abhay deol role should be big

Yashaswini is really great...😍😍

Abhay deol kamaal ka actor h Waiting for this bhai <a href="">#BabaHaryanvi</a>

Why do I get Wes Anderson vive

My like is for abhay ..how awesome he is !!

Abhay Deol is always a delight to watch. 🥃

Have to watch for Abhay Deol
Ye can come on trending but not carryminati
 memes...akshay kumar and modiji....phir hera pheri and donald trump

<a href="">1:07</a>  &quot;awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww&#39;🤣🤣🤣
 memes modiji and akshay kumar

Yashaswini is so effortlessly good. Loved her in Dear Zindagi!

After ghost stories, guilty and mrs. serial killer,  here comes another disaster from Netflix.

Petition : Every trailer need to clarify if its a series or a movie.

Wes Anderson feels anyone ?

Y NetFlix India is buying everything served on the plate.. Is there no Selection Team or by watevr name they R called at Netflix India Office....?

not much understanding
Well well yeh song ki tune guardians of  galaxy 2 song ki copy hai

I&#39;m hoping there is no overacting by teen-agers..

<b>That&#39;s not Indian content...don&#39;t sell your trash here Netflix..</b>

it&#39;s look like and of the fucking world web series which is available on Netflix itself

isn&#39;t abhay resembles with dharmender .....????

Fev. Abhay deal🤴
Star kids ho toh akshay khanna abhay deol abhimanyu dasani etc jaise ho
It will be biggest flop of netflix

Apney paas to Netflix haiye nahin !

I&#39;ll only watch this for yashaswini .......♥️♥️♥️She is so genuine actor.....!

After he acted in zindagi na milegi dobara i fell in live with his acting . Waiting for this eagerly!!!! ♥️😘

Only for Abhay deol

This is arriving sooner than expected!

Trailer looks really nice.

Abhay Deol is good actor

I want money heist Tamil version for all seasons plzzz accept my request 🙏🙏🙏

Abhay Deol 👏👏
And here he comes. ABD

Has anyone noticed that the guy starring opposite Yashaswini is Jagiya from the fame Balika Vadhu...

This has some serious Royal Tenembaum Vibes...

The only reason I liked this video is abhay deol or else I am sorry but the story isn’t interesting to me 🤷🏼‍♀️

Abhay should be working in Hollywood.. Bollywood is nothing but nepotism and stupid same scripts with minor changes at the end it comes down to unrelistic love ..... If I win a lottery and make millions I will definitely make movie with Abhay not in bollywood but Hollywood where people follow and respect  content...

<a href="">

I didn't know why... but I was wearing Gullie suit...
I see Abhay Deol in the thumbnail, I click it

Not really interesting by the looks of it, saw this kind of movies/series more than enough. I hope this wouldn&#39;t be a copy and paste.

Directed by Megha Ramaswamy. It has to be a really good stuff.

Abhay Deol is the most underrated actor of BollywoodNo. Of People Who agree👇👇(I&#39;m a middle class singer. Support me 🙏)

Abhay is the only reason I would wanna watch this.karanvir seems good too

Om Sai Ram🙏All the best to Abhay Deol and team, we will be able to see Abhay Deol after a long gap.
What were the odds that we would see abhay deol again? 😍😍😍

NGL, I love the vibes of all the locations shown in this trailer 💝

Nice

Looks interesting

Abhay deol deserves much moreeee
Bhaiii please.... don&#39;t release

<a href="">0:18</a> with gillie suit 😀😅😆😆
The most amazing tallented and underrated actor.. But honestly that&#39;s totally fine he selects his scripts and works on it .. Giving always wonderful entertainments... Big fan Abhay Deol ji..

Soo is this a series or movies??

Looks like the lite version of the end of the fucking world

Abhay Deol is so refreshing and effortless. Coincidentally just got done with Shanghai on Netflix.

Only Netflix knows value of abhay deol

Stopped the trailer in the mid. Why do a spoiler when you&#39;re gonna watch genius Abhay Deol at work anyway ❤Bollywood doesn&#39;t deserve Abhay Deol. Period.

Ok so this is copied from...???

Abhishek Bachchan and Abhay Deol.You know what I mean...

The only DEOL who makes sensible movies, and Yash is perfect for for this role

Like that <a href="">#haraamkhor</a> movie

He got all the acting talent among other Deol&#39;s

Netflix, what are the odds that people are gonna watch this ?

Useless he will not see any dog
<a href="">

Why it&#39;s feel like end of fuckin world ....

God.. How much i had wished to see Abhay Deol in a new movie. This guy is a gem of a actor. His laid back style of acting and the offbeat roles he accomplishes with utmost ease has always made me wonder why Bollywood never gives the due respect he deserves.   Thank you NETFLIX.

Abhayyyyyy... Haayyyyeeee...
Very artistic visuals 👌

Already on my watchlist the moment I saw Abhay Deol in the thumbnail

Hit one like for abhay deol....he always choose something which is very different from going trend...since his first movie.

this movies will either be REALLY BAD or REALLY GOOD

One of the finest actor but bollywood politics  ruined his career... But still he is one of my favorite.

One like is made for Abhay. It is always a pleasure to see this versatile artist. Thank you Netflix India.
Abhay Deol hai Toh Sab Mast hai

<a href="">#justiceforcarry</a>

Feels like a remake of Adventureland (2009)

Abhay Deol I LOVE YOU
Is this a series or a movie?

Literally it&#39;s like my favorite series &quot;the end of the fucking world&quot; in indian version love it.....

Abhay Deol, one of the most unorthodox, underrated Indian actors. It&#39;s really sad that he&#39;s not getting roles he truly deserves. Hope this changes.

What kind of food have you made?
Looks delightful.
Abhay Deol is a good actor with extraordinary skills.

Looking like another worst from Netflix. Abhay Deol is a good actor but these stories no

Abhay is only talented actor in his Deol family..

There is no power to shoot this movie in my area...it doesn't look good for the upper class...Abhay sir 👍
Waiting for this.. Team ILS

Abhay deol is super talented ❤️❤️❤️
These are all fake cheeses...asli cheese dikao pataal lok type...samjhayyyy
<b>The end of the world</b>
Bollywood is more concerned about overrated actors but now due to number of platform we have got a chance to watch underrated talents. Additionally OTT platforms link Hindi/English audiance with amazing PAN India cinema like tamil, Telugu, Marathi, malayalam etc through dubbing or providing subtitles facilities.

I don&#39;t understand why some of the indian series are in English language,and they tag as the Hindi content,if u want to make in English language then make ,why mixing, please either make fully English content or Hindi content and please don&#39;t mixed and don&#39;t forget Hollywood series have great English content

I&#39;m a simple man, i see abhay deol, i watch it.
It&#39;s the guy from selection day

Maoe more films with Abhay Sell...he&#39;s such an underrated actor...

Lucky and Bengali with me
Well abhay Deol is better with Netflix and not with dumbass Bollywood

This looks like a breath of fresh air in these days! SO EXCITED! Abhay has all my heart. 😍

I trust abhay deol.....But I don&#39;t trust netflixSo I will wait....... until the review

Dear life...Jesa ku6?
I wanna see this movie coz of kantah bai

One thing I can say there is no sun in this show...bahar jake dekho dhup see phati padi h

Vo Sab to thik hai par....itni ENGLISH kaahe. 😩

Long live!!! Rayyyy❤️
I have liked only for yashashwini dayama

Abhey Deol ...the most underrated actor .....feel sad as well as angry ..for him not getting his dues as well as recognition.....always saw him at par with irfan Khan ...famous for effortless expressions ..acting ..portraying emotions through eyes ..and face expressions ...good to see him after ages or you can say after chopsticks ....on Netflix ....👍🏻👍🏻 but as one says ...hard work and talent is not enough till you have luck and that all the good one on your side ..in this industry ....hope one day he finally achieve what he deserve ...😔😔😔

Watching this trailer only for abhay deol

excited 😁yashaswini ❤️❤️❤️
Wes Anderson-esque

I felt love ke the end of fucking world scenes!!

Kanta Bhen?!
Is she kanta bai?

Looks fun!

Cant wait man!!

You just know it&#39;ll be good when you see Abhay Deol

What are you backfiring friend... No other content found...
A tinge of money Heist?

Love watching Abhay since Socha Na Tha.
Apreciate the trailer but this trailer reminded me of some movie I have seen anyone else felt the same?

In his initial roles in bollywood , he did some interesting roles but Netflix instead of these stories including that last one could have made Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye sequal or new storyline with that same character that he played in that above movie .

Hey what do you want to say??
What are the odds that Netflix India will make better content?

Woody Allen&#39;s influence a little around

Scott pilgrim ki vibes aaya mujhe to.. anyone else?

is it supposed to be an indian version of The end of the f**king world?

Netflix India is going down REALLY, REALLY FAST. I am afraid Sacred Games seems like a fluke now.

Thanks Netflix guys for bringing Abhay Deol back 🙏🏼
I&#39;ve had enough of candy content Netflix.

Netflix why you foxing Bollywood actorJust do the dubbing of Hollywood contact in Hindi on Netflix I am from India but I don&#39;t like Indian actors

<a href="">0:37</a> that&#39;s sulabha arya after watching this trailer my mom recognised her... She was my mother&#39;s phycology teacher in high school NB and LU collage, she was also her theatre teacher, my mom is was really happy to her that even today she is doing what she always loved.

Abhay was very good in Chopsticks. It was quite disappointing that the critics didn&#39;t like that hilarious movie.

Does everything has to be a fucking musical in bollywood... <a href="">#growup</a> bollywood...

It looks like the Hindi version of the end of f*cking world but also not. 😂 looks interesting but I don&#39;t think peeps are gonna watch :(

Only for yashaswini🥰🥰👍
I like how Netflix chooses talented actors because bollywood has dominated by nepotism and these actors never got credit for their work.

Is anybody getting the vibes of  &quot;The End of the Fkin World&quot;

What are the odds that south indian directors have already reached hollywood cinema...

What are the odds that a guy like you would want to hang out with a girl like me?

Are bo starting m gully suit main kon tha 😂😂

We need some more out of u ABHAY SIR

The best abhay deol

Netflix walo ko abhay sahab saste me mill ja rhe aaj kl....

Idk a Netflix film always feels like a Netflix film, in a bad way.

I&#39;m here for Kanta Ben 💝

Abhay Deol is ❤️❤️ and Yashaswini is so cute 😍 I love them!!
From the day of &quot;Dear zindagi&quot;,  i know that Yashaswini Dayama will get some big projects...Yahooooooooo....🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺<a href="">#MyCricketTown</a>

Looks like a homage to Wes Anderson. Abhay Deol seems to be a perfect match for this universe. High Hopes!

Yashswini dyanymic
nonsense
Yashasvini.
Show Abhay Deol in the trailer and hit the web series.
When is it releasing?

It legit looks good.

Moonrise kingdom, royal tenenbaum, Rushmore and a few other Wes Andrerson movies mixed with Indian green mangoes and the sweetness of Hindi language - hopefully yum

WHAT IS THAT FKN AMAZING SONG, WILL SOMEONE TELL ME!!!

Go n watch my roasting video on ajaz khan and many more.... Need support ❤️

This is a movie for collegian pigeons.
Netflix India is like Netflix bhojpuri

I think it&#39;s like &quot;End of the fucking world &quot; .. bus sale remake hi krte rhte h.. ya to south ka ya phir Hollywood ka..

So excited to watch Abhay again after quite a long time (last one was Chopsticks) ... good to see him in a zone where he can do the kind of work he wants to do , not running after the 100 crore club !!!

Indian version of THE END OF THE FUCKING WORLD

How come these people speak english so fluently....some times I just don&#39;t understand what they say 😲

End of fking world heloo

English nahi aati....
I like yashaswini alot
yeh netlflix india saste wale nashe karne laga hai

Wanted more of Abhay Deol here. But it will work

Another English Language Netlfix Flick....Showing English Language Films In India....Even Hollywood Films Are Dubbed In Hindi....Netlfix Is Just A Antiindian Video Streaming Service...Shame!

Avay is here .. Nothing to fear 💙💙💙

Abhay chosen right platform. And it’s the time for OTT. Days are gone when talented actors had to wait for opportunities because Netflix itself is the biggest opportunity :)

I&#39;m here for only abhay deol ❤

Looks promising

Is that kanta bhen

The Ram name of Bollywood is Satya Hai, it has started.

<i>Woh bachpan me garmi ki chitti jab atti thi nai.. wahi feeling aarahi hai ise dekh ke. Definitely gonna watch this wholesome show</i>

Can&#39;t wait to see Abhay Deol and this new cast!

Had a very Wes Anderson feel to it!!

I&#39;m gonna watch this and buy the soundtrack and listen to the soundtrack on spotify until it is available for purchase.

Abhay deol is such an amazing actor and Yashaswini in this makes it more fun👌👌❤️❤️
Awaiting
Such a happy trailer love it.

Why does this look like a new season of &#39;The end of the f***ing world&#39;?

Once again Abhay is back with a unique &amp; out of box content.....We viewers should respect such actor when we have time....😎

Indian version of end of the fu<a href="">#king</a> world

Just how many web series  Netflix had planned before Lockdown

He is like to v next &quot;sir Irfan khan&quot;Doing best acting but rated low , ONE DAY HE SHINES LIKE ,IRFAN SIR.👍👍

Abhay Deol is the only Deol I know,  who knows how to Act.. He really knows the craft of acting.. I love him &amp; his craft..

This is something really amaziiinnnggg

Anybody else getting &quot; THE end of the fu*king world&quot; vibes? No just me. Ok

i sense a good movie here.... like finally

I would like to thank Netflix for making life better during this lockdown!

Red track pants, a LOT of symmetry, idiosyncratic characters, 60s sounding music. Folks, we just might have a Desi Wes Anderson flick right here.

Abhay deol❣👌
The director has wrked beautifully with the composition of each frame.certainly looks different.A must watch!Vijji

Bakwaas... There is no masala in it..... Netflix has to unsubscribe..... Amazonprime is better in American platforms.... BTW when will you watch the webseries? There will be an entry scene till the entire 10th episode... the story will not even go on...
Ray madav in the house 😍😍😍😍Netflix sala tum kabh kabh dil jeet lete ho..

janiye kon tha OMAR MUKHTAR??know who was OMAR MUKHTAR??<a href="">

A rapid montage of all that is relevant to the youth ...superb VR

This looks like &quot;The End of the Fucking World&quot; Indian version....

NETFLIX: Abhay Deol??ME: Anytime Man, Anytime!
❤️💫this is sooooo goood
In association with ABHAY DEOL, say no more fam. Im in.

Floop jayega

Wes Anderson vibes

Coming best <a href="">
So cute !!!

Abhy deol next radhika aapte🤘
Again a flop show i guess

Better than this is expected from Abhay Deol
THEM - Why dont you have any friends?ME - I am not the most social person.

I love the Wes Anderson type shots.

Abhya is Back 👊👊 one of my fav actor. Thanks Netflix
Hope this doesn&#39;t turn out to be another chopsticks

What are the Odds that trailer is dropping on 18th and Film Releasing 20th of the same month??

Why does it feel they tried ripping off Wes Anderson but failed

18 Ko Trailer20 Ko ReleaseBadi Jaldi mein Ho Netflixwa😅

What are the odds of we making it through?

Woooaaaahhhh ....netflix our rescuer for the quarantine ...trailer looks awesome.!!

Abhay deol deserve better than this..<a href="">#krishnabhaiyabanarawale</a>

By the look and the style I thought it was directed by Homi Adajania.

Ghillie suit 😂😂
The story is good. But nothing much was made keeping Netflix in mind. Some looks, some dilouge. Inspired by the Netflix series.
Are kissing scenes the new cool?? I mean i have seen a lot of web series and movies on ott platforms where kissing scenes or semi nude scenes were there even if the script didn&#39;t  demanded so....

In love 😍❤️😍
@NetflixIndia Plx make Abhay Deol your next Radhika Apte

Abhay Deol 🙌🏻
I never Knew ... I needed this comedy series with Abhay, Monica, Yashaswini in cast ... YES !

RAY is here 🥰😍😍😍😍😍
Yes please I’m always up for good content

Yasashwini&#39;s acting looks so real ... And abhay deol omg 😍

I see Abhay Deol and I hit like. Most underrated actor of India.

Anyone also get wes anderson vibes?

Great I&#39;m excited

If I will be watching it , then the reason will be Abhay Deol

Am I the only on who came for karanvir from selection day?

Acha hoga laag hai...
It&#39;s crazy trailer😅👌👌

Indian version of the end of fucking world (series)..

Abjau deol...i wish Bollywood could see this gem..😬😬Alws love to watch you...

If I go expecting a series, it&#39;ll be a movie; or the other way around.

Cantab!!!!!!!!!
&quot;End of the fucking world&quot; vibes

Stop selling this on the name of Abay Deol please, why the brilliance in this world is destroyed by overrated storytellers and some actors who went nuts because of success. Netflix, please make a proper series with Abay Deol...He is one of the most underrated actor in the industry and worth more than what he is getting currently.

<b>I&#39;m</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Okay</b> <b>With</b> <b>This</b>

long live ❤️
Make new series like lunchbox

Happy to see Abhay Deol doing good on Netflix

Looking at the trailer, it seems that Guilty, Mrs. After the serial killer nonsense, Netflix is ​​coming up with another nonsense.

THE ACTORS in bollywood : why don&#39;t we get much work?meanwhileNETFLIX: karte hain hum prabandh

My man Abhay is back :)

This really reminds me of The End of this F**king world....

Arey isme toh kanta Bai hai..😂😂

I am a simple man. I see Abhay Deol, I click.

After so long Netflix has finally come up with an interesting original. Full of quirks, eagerly waiting.

i just want to find that person who messed up indian english &quot;I was also there &#39; NOOO&#39;&quot;... What the helll

Look&#39;s something new !

I&#39;m interested

Yeh hai kahani ek ladke aur ladki ki ... Well this is different.

Does anybody know selection day season 2 release date

Why I&#39;m getting &quot;End of f_#$ world&quot; vibes..?😅

Feels like a wood Allen or wes Anderson directorial ❤️❤️👍🙌
I found the Indian version of Denver😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Looking forward

I hope it will be available also outside Netflix India!!

I can&#39;t wait!!

This Deol is &quot;Abhay&quot; when it comes to choosing films...

It seems that Netflix has taken out the Indian language.
Abhay Deol had a big fight with Shankar Ehsan Loy and after that his career went down . Poor Abhay ... didn&#39;t even estimate the consequences before fighting with someone like the trio&#39;s.

Abhay Deol best

ghillie suit.... @18sec
Yashswini&#39;s acting seems like female version of Sumit vyas.

I didn't understand the trailer but I thought it would be better to watch it.
Watch once, it takes time to forget Motivational video
Abhay Deol ki wajah se dekhna hi padega, most underrated actor in bollywood...

Good to see abhay after long time

Abay Deol charecter looks like father of ARCHIE ANDREWS IN RIVERDALE

So more like a desi happy end of the fucking world?

I already am in love with the movie. The trailer looks so promising.

is that is *end of the f**king world&quot;hindi version 🤣🤣

Finally abhay!

Most underrated actor of our generation.

Will watch it only for Abhay Deol. It&#39;s so good to see him after a long time.

Seems interesting🙂🙂🙂

Typical Hollywood &#39;coming of age film&#39; in a Bollywood avatar 🙄

Everyone is talking about Abhay Deol but DAMN!! just look at Yashaswini.❤️

This video is as longer as it&#39;s descending nmbr of time😂😂😂😂😂see..

Abhay devol best movie Zindagi Na milegi again 🤘🤘
Only for👍Abhay Deol

Is this film or series?

<b>As we all know that ABHAY DEOL is most underrated actor.</b>

Abhay Deol returns. Amazing!

These are the evens of the odds!

Abhay deol really deserves better from bollywood. His calibre is of devd and socha na tha he&#39;s seriously been let down with the kind of scripts hes been given.

Love fie

He will probably manage to spoil his name in Netflix India!!
<a href="">0:18</a> ghillie suit... 😂😂😂
Yar Indian centric shows banao na ye foreign shows se inspired hoke shows kyun bana rahe ho.... netflix is loosing its charm.... AmazonPrime is launching shows like Paatal Lok and netflix what are the odds ..... Odds that u dont make good shows anymore Netflix india.

kuch smj m ni aaya kya tha yeh
Good but wait for review

I&#39;m not going to watch this movie to waste my time

5th

First

We are odds

First to comment: nice, excited to watch
