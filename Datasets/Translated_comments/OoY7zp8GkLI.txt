Am I the only one that watches phones dat we cannot afford

This is gonna be my first phone that’s not second hand, can’t wait till it arrives

iPhone 11 is so good you are so good at explaining how it works

I know this video is almost half a decade old, but when you pick 1080p in youtube, it isn&#39;t lying to you. It&#39;s downscaling from 1080p. You will still get better quality because you are approximating what the image should look like at your native resolution based on more input data.

My father has this phone but this year they replaced iPhone 11 to iPhone 13

sad how fast time flies and how old the iphone 11 is😢

I am now using this phone in 2024❤❤

watching  this on 15 pro after 4 years with my 11. got some water damage and decided to move on  miss u 11 what a solid phone for the price no cappppp

Great presentation!  Thanks very much!

<a href="">3:02</a> thiccness

I’m not sure why but I’ve seen so many people upgrade from 6/7/8 to an 11 and I think it’s a good phone don’t get me wrong but the design and j 2023 doesn’t feel very new. I’d rather get the 12 in 2023

Wow

bro 4 years later I wish apple goes back to the  circle sides for the iphones

This habit of watching videos Of phones I can’t afford should stop😭😭😂😂

Wait till you hear of iphone 15 💀

mrwhosetheboss gang is heree

I love how long iPhones just last. I purchased my iPhone 11 in 2019 before the pandemic. Four years later my 11 still works with 77% battery health and a few scuffs and scratches to remind me of the good times and the bad. I’m just going to wait out until Apple doesn’t support it anymore before I get rid of it just like my iPhone 4. Buying iPhones have been my most environmentally conscious decision for a phone.

Watching after 4 years still the same design

nice try apple

Am I the only one that watches videos when I get a new phone

And it&#39;s still good in 2023 😂

CMOM MAN THATS TOO EASY

My iPhone 11 is the exact same colour as yours

Watching on iPhone X 😂

Crazy how well this phone works despite it being like 4 years old

It&#39;s late-2023 and I <b>still</b> rock a mint condition (and mint green) iPhone 11. Best form factor of them all, IMHO.

Me watching this with in my 4 year old iPhone 11 because I’m too broke to get a new phone and I want to feel good about my current one 😭

Should’ve had oled and MagSafe especially if they knew it was coming a year later

2023 🇲🇾
Looking back. Things were just better then. 😢

Perfect iphone for a not-so-perfect mortal being

I have an iPhone 11 and I like hearing people’s reviews about it.Sure,I may get a new iPhone.But you wanna know something…I DONT CARE

Watching this in 2023 so my phone feels newer and I don’t get tempted to buy the 14 pro, which I absolutely do not need

How does the 11 display compare with the XR? I thought the XR was quite good.

I’m currently using IPhone 6s, so i was thinking of purchasing 11. Is it worth it? I’m trying to save money. I can’t afford the new one which is 14 OR should i just go for 13? Can anyone recommend me

I can get this phone now for 100$

<b>So whats new?</b>M: so the name...

i just bought the iphone 1SE is it the same

Good afternoon
Hello

Hi

it good phone  iPhone 11

Next year maybe yes or no iPhone  se

I have a iPhone 11

I&#39;m trying to find iphone 11 for cheap

Whenever I feel like I should update my 11 and I am actually broke, I just get back to this video and feel super nice about my 11. Lol.

Watching on my Android 😂

Nice reviews😊This Helped📍

Hi! I just got my Iphone 11 after 3 years, and I do love it ! Watching lots of vids hahahahaha :))

I’m lost I have a iPhone 11 and I watch 4k vids all the time and the quality is as sharp as it shud be

My iPhone 11 is 4 years old now. The battery capacity has dropped to 78% so the phone is just starting to show its age. Still runs smooth and fast, just less hours between charges. Honestly considering replacing the battery instead of waiting for iPhone 15 but we shall see.

I went to a 11 from a 8+ and 6S prior a couple of months ago. It’s the biggest POS that I’ve ever owned. It will not swipe correctly and freeze frequently. I contacted Apple 3 times and they sent me to an authorized repair station. They tested the phone when it was cool and found nothing wrong. It Freezes and they won’t do anything about it. No more iPhones for me.

Very informative video.  Thanks for sharing.  Have a great day. 😊

&quot;That was easy.&quot;Thank you.I like easy.😁😁😁🤩🤩🤩
I own the iPhone 11 for 8 months. My battery health is still at 100% battery health. It’s a tank.

i went from 1 to 14.. the changes are not that great

I am going to SE (2nd gen) to this 11

The 11 till this day is still great iPhones age so well

I just wish I could afford ...😢

Apple iphone 14 pro ♥️
Me watching this when the iPhone 14 is out

Phone been out four years now

Watching on iPhone 11.

From a 8 to a 11

This is the last iPhone (barring the se’s) to come with an lcd panel and a screen res below 1080p. This is the last iPhone again barring the se 2 that does not have 5g built in. I remember when this phone got so popular at its launch. It even got the best camera award for 2019 mid rangers! It’s still sold in India as the cheapest iPhone model and people are still buying it.

Dont waste time guys its 2023 don&#39;t buy this 11 shitt 😂

iPhone 11 in 2023 is crazy

hey marques how about a video for iphone 11 now.

I have family photos on a USB thumb drive.  Can I use the USB C adapter with the IPhone 11 to access my photos on the thumb drive and save to IPhone photos ❓❓❓

i like the body of these than the edgy newer iphone 😮😊 i probably will be upgrading to this 😂

Camera is horrible. Nightstand sucks big ass.

Are you allowed to send one of your viewers an iphone because they can never afford an iphone and peer pressure is now killing them because all their friends have an iphone. If you could that would be amazing but if you can&#39;t I understand, it&#39;s just a shot in the dark.

I might as well get one myself bro 💯

Sold my iPhone 11 for S23. 😀

as of an now I am the newest owner of an iphone 11... I am still checking the nooks n cranies as it is a refurbrish phone... even now 3 years in it still costs a heafty sum, at least for my kinda pockets. although it was less than the orignal price. Everything seems to be working fine... camera does some very clever things, so yah im gonna be exprimenting with that... last apple product I owned was their first 10 inch tablets from round 2010. Funny thing is that the build quality on that was as good as this feels maybe even better. I passed on buying a &#39;22 freshoutthebox android flagship that was also ALOT cheaper..

Watching things I cannot afford 🤝

s l o w f i e
and if you dont gte about night photography get the xr

if u need a budget iphone just get iphone 11

<a href="">6:08</a> My phone has a 720p screen and the YouTube app lies to me and lets me pick 4K (2160p) for videos that support that option so that is not surprising.

Your hands are beautiful ❤

Thank you 🙏

So since the XR is basically an 11 and an 14 is basically the 11 means the XR is basically a 14

Iove that your still helping the people out i usually go with my phone choice based off ur review and of course my budget at the time lol

Same

I’m gonna upgrade from the 8 to this

Man has the voice of a white guy named george😂

Rewatching this in 2023, anyone else?<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/vQF1XpyaG_XG8gTs77bACQ"></a>

Watching this to make my iPhone 11 feel new.

Hello from Samsung to all iphone slaves,in nearest future iphone will leave you without pants, congrats.

even if an iphone 11 is from 3 years ago huhu i still want one, i don&#39;t have a phone hahaha i have a 16k Pesos phone and is broken.

how do you guys say the battery is good? i just bought mine and the battery is so bad, it even drains even tho i am not using it.

Forgot my iCloud password and was locked out after connecting with <b>cybernet_hacker</b> I was granted acess,so honest and trustworthy

I went from a string and a can to an iphone 11 the difference amazing..

I&#39;m a 7 plus user.. I&#39;m here because I bought 11 last night for my eldest daughter..

Best size and lightweight iphone ever got

I miss the smooth sides on the new iPhones it doesn’t have smooth sides

I’m using the 11 rn

from the future and still too broke to buy it

Should I buy it?

I swear the iPhone 11 had a different camera design

I have an iPhone 11 its amazing😊 i love it

W

But im now watch a 1440 p videos on youtube

Just upgraded iPhone 5 to 11

2 years later and I&#39;m waiting for this phone aha

İphone 11 128gb price is 890 $ here..

Watching this video in 2022 on my iPhone 11

Me watching this on my iPhone 11

Currently using a 7 but gonna get 11 in 2ish weeks

I upgraded to a Samsung s7 to a iPhone 11 and boi should I say I never liked android I loved iPhones from the start but at that time I didn’t have the budget for a iPhone so I kept it for 4 years then it randomly switched of and the camera started glitching and then my phones screen had some weird looking lasers Al over the screen after that the repair dude told me that’s it a waste of money so then I saw a iPhone 11 used for 500 bucks it was a 256 gb the screen was smashed up and it needed a new batery so I bought I repair it then after 1 Month of using i sold it for 750 bucks since it has a lot a storage then with that 750 bucks I aded some more money and bought a brand new out of the box iPhone 11 Pro it soo cool

I don&#39;t care about colors. I want to know about what comes pre-installed. I hate them that comes preloaded with apps I don&#39;t use taking up space.

Remuneration when YouTube came preinstalled on iphone

So this is what @Jidion&#39;s other name came from

Wait .. this wasn&#39;t a HD phone?

Still watching this on my iPhone 11 in 2022 - no regrets buying it and it works like a charm &lt;3

iPhone 11/Pro are the best iPhones ever made. I remember the excitement of getting the 11pro certainly not that excited when I got my 14 pro. The shape of the phones plus the colors offered were outstanding. Loved that minty green and the midnight green

I am confused in choosing XS or 11

Bro I just got my iPhone 11 a couple months ago, and it’s beautiful.

I switch from an oled Samsung S9 to this, honestly my eye sight is crap so I don’t really notice the phone was 720p doesn’t really matter to me I guess. My first iPhone ever and I’m enjoying it

im actrally commenting this 2 years later not 3

watching this so that my iphone 11 feels brand new again

I have an unboxing of my white iPhone 13 pro max on my channel. i&#39;ll upgrade next year and most likely will get the black one.

Battery is a major concern 😬

It disappoints me that Apple got rid of the smooth sides for the harsher, squared off edges of the 12, 13, and 14.

anyone here from India watching this for big billion days and thinking about getting iPhone 11 for yourself?

changing from iphone se first gen to this and omg let me tell u it’s VERY different but i love it so far

bought it today, it is a perfect phone, prefer it to the newwest models.Edit: I changed my mind, I dont like it, it&#39;s small and is feminine.

Watching this while my phone is getting shipped :)

I actually love my iPhone 11 I can’t believe the battery life on it.

I’m going from a 6 to 11!! Super excited 🤩🤩🤩
IPHONE 11 GANG WE RISE!!!!

Getting my iPhone 11 for the second time tomorrow, can&#39;t wait!! its getting shipped to my house tomorrow😁

Bro if you are watching this video today trust me this is the best Iphone it&#39;s been 2yrs i am still getting good backup and Gaming

Me thinking I’m watching this in 1080P on iPhone 8: 👁👄👁

iphone XRS

ooooo

Combo break...
Can I have one of your iphones that you have reviewed please

I just went from 11 to 11 pro but there is no changes except cameras 😂😂😂 that’s sucks 😂💸💸💸

That intro takin me to church😂

Nope, you’re not the only one.  I’ve become an expert on the: X, Xr, 11, 11mini, 12, 12 mini, se and I’m no closer to deciding than I was a month ago🫣

2 years later and this is my first iPhone.

Iphone 11 white, wer u at?

wish i had one

POV: Your watching this cause you want one.

i went from a 8 to an 11. the photo quality and battery life is 10x better

I am not impressed with iPhones. Android for Life

Note 10 to iPhone 11. It honestly feels like a downgrade , it probably is 🤧

I thought that was Jidion😂😂😂

I’m on a Oneplus 6, that’s running out of life. Stuck between another Oneplus or a IPhone X/11…. Maybe a different android?

I went from iPhone 13 pro max 1tb to iPhone 11 and I can tell you I miss the 13 pro max battery 🔋

Should I buy it or wait for 14 when the price drops?

i have the i phon 12 pro max and i really love the i phone 11 pro max

Please give me a iphone 11 😭

best iPhone

Even if you don&#39;t care about the resolution of the display i would feel  pretty robbed  if I bought an iPhone in 2019 with a sub 1080P display that&#39;s not even an oled

I upgraded from a 11 to a 12 and the screen difference is definitely noticeable .

15.7 Million subscribers?

I got your add on your video lol

Na u ain’t the only one

watching this in 1080p on Samsung J6 plus$150 Price

Wow MKBHD looks so different 3 years ago

That’s the same phone I really wanted but never got wish I did

I just the iPhone 11 but can’t open it until Friday when my case and screen protector comes 😢

I went from a 7 to an 11 and I’m just blown away with mainly the picture quality with the 11

Sloppy 😹
I went from a iPhone 8 to a iPhone 11, I like the fact it’s bigger and there a setting called Face ID.

I will get the iPhone 11 just waiting for it

Just bought one for 300. Hoping this will last me a few years. Had the S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max but I was just kind of annoyed with the big phones and settled for this one.

I just upgraded from my Nokia 1.3 to an iPhone 4s. HUGE Difference!

I wish I could have a phone like this 🥺

I love this colour!!!

This man the GOAT at tech reviews !

Damn this was pre pandemie 😭😭😭

I thought you was a white person, until I looked at the screen. 😂

may 2022 and i just bought one refurbished. definitely recommend it 👍🏾

Watched on my Motorola Edge S ✌🏼😋👍🏼😃
Got my iPhone 11 two days ago!
Develop

I have a iPhone 11 in 2022 and it is still a great phone

Excellent review….
Nearly two years later and I still love my iPhone 11. If there’s a reason I’d want to upgrade would be the battery

I just went from a 7 s plus to this 11 I like it so far yes it is smaller but it’s good it’s not as big but it’s not tiny so I like it 😂

I just bought this phone for 200$ at Walmart brand new I always wait about 3 to 4 yrs before I update 😂

I still have an iPhone 7 and thinking of switching to this cause it’s only $10 extra per month. Looks like quite the upgrade even though it’s now an older phone.

I went from public phone to Iphone 11.

Do you guys think it is still worth it to buy Iphone 11 in 2022? Coz I have been using samsung a30 and it has been 4 yrs now it is laggy so I am thinking switching to apple 😅 your reply will be highly appreciated! Please ☺

Well, That was easy...

I like how we watch these videos when we are about to get a new phone and never when deciding on which phone to get

Should i buy one for 300$? Used but almost brand new.

I have decided to go for a Used  iPhone 12 pro I am confused whether to buy from phonedaddy or another online store

heyo from 2022 im getting this for my 12th birthday on june 19th hopefully earlier and when i tell u this phone is still one of the best iphones to get not the BEST but one of the best the price dropped wayy down so its much cheaper to get

reviewing this after i finally buy iphone 11 in 2022

How much money soudi Arabia

Hi, I just subscribed your channel because I really envy people who can afford an iPhone. 😭

I went from a se 2020 to the 11 best iPhone I ever had

Upgrading from a 100 dollar android to an IPhone 11!

iPhone X OLED Display, iPhone 11 LCD display lmao

hehehehehe nice one mkbhd <a href="">4:12</a>
Is this still worth your money in 2022?

I gotta say, going from the 7 plus to the 11 was quite a leap. I feel like I&#39;m living in the future.😂😂

Bro I watched your Video in the Afternoon and Went to bought it in the evening and now I am watching this video again with my IPhone 11 😁

im going from an android to iphone 11, wish me luck

Robin.  W

Nice, can&#39;t wait for the iPhone 20 with 6 cameras.

Everyone : improvement from the XR Me: the happened to the XS or XS max it is better

Still my favourite in 2022

Very bad phone in my whole life

watching this video on my iphone XR

Got a s20 fe. I just decided to buy the iphone 11 should i switch to the iphone full time?

The only issue I have with this is that it heats up while charging. I am concerned about the battery degradation it might cause.

Thank you i Get My phone next week 🙌😃the main reason i need this is because i need to take northenlights pictures ,and it do not cost so much money 😃

<a href="">10:22</a> Everyone likes milk tea. And you like to infiltrate my heart.
Fireworks 🎇
Im getting this one in 2022 a big upgrade for me since Ive had a 6s for a few years now

I have an android and I&#39;m so tired of getting made fun of because of the phone I use😂 I&#39;m literally on the verge of saving all my money and buying the iphone 11

Time went really fast

I had the iPhone 7 plus then I got the iPhone XR I just gave it to my mam I was thinking about getting the iPhone 11 I know it&#39;s 2022 but I&#39;m not paying too much for one as I will probably hardly use it

Dream🥺❤️
please give me this phone

Not iphone 11 iphone 11 full video my YouTube channel ma ha ok bro
Nice

I went form sending a Raven to IPhone 11 and the changes are ridiculous

Your ads are bullshit

The respecc for not saying slofie. Subscribed.

Watching this to make my iphone 11 feel brandnew

My dad bought one and i can say, it kinda sucks for the price, better off with a samsung, the iphone was renewed payed 490, no accesories and that one was the cheapest one in my country, camera sucks, os sucks, the apple id thing is not as easy to use as android, weve always used android phones and windows pc, so an iphone cant fit in with us, overall you dont get what you pay for

May I ask that is it still worth to upgrade to Iphone 11??  Due to the 5G network is coming.

big brands
I&#39;m watching these vedio with Xaomi A2 Lite in 2022🙂

Still worth it now ?

<b>I just really downgraded from a android to an iphone, and the lack of my iphones capabilities by comparison are intense.</b>

Pure over-priced garbage that does less for more $$$. Go with an android, unless you are very simple minded.

Jesus loves u which is why he suffered and died for ur sins so pls turn to him, he changed my life for the better, he saved me from my own stupid desires and he can so the same for u if u accept him into ur heart and confess that he is ur lord and personal savior, turn from sin and receive the gift of eternity in heaven that Christ died for u to have

i just upgraded from the 4 to the 11

Just wen from an IPhone 4 to an IPhone 11. The changes are incredible!

I have an iphone 6s, I waited for the iphone 11 to drop below $600 and just bought it. Waiting for it to arrive and this review has me so excited! Thank you!!

Red one is better

i got the 11 because i wanted to gloat to my friends that i dont have a home button anymore. I’ve had the 7 plus for ages.

i went from an ipod to this

The notifications at the top where you swipe down are somewhat small-

I will buy ,if and only if,  this ip11 😁

Thinking about getting one of these for my special needs daughter. Verizon is giving it for free for adding an additional line- I already have unlimited data

This is my second time watching one of your reviews. First of all I wanna thank you because I think you’re the best. And you have pretty much helped me to make up my mind as to which phone to buy for my wife for Christmas. With that said happy holidays!

I love your reviews man

im going from an iPod to an iPhone11

I’m going from an iPhone SE 1st generation (ik lol) to this phone and it’s gonna be such a big change 😂 can’t wait

<a href="">3:06</a> me: whe I get on my grandmas phone😅

I hate the LCD screen. I mean for that money I can get oled in android but android is basically just commie malware now so…. Idk where I’m going with this

The window shopping GANG 🛍 be like 👁👄👁
it&#39;s so big 😭 that&#39;s my only complaint i used to be able to use one hand with my iphone 8 and now i can&#39;t

Damn dude, you are so damn chill, friendly and charismatic. I really enjoy being updated by you on products. Pls keep up your work! :)

Guys i went from a Samsung Galazy ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ82 to a iPhone 14 That has 16 Cameras! 😀 It is such a big downgrade!

I really want a iphone..

I really love iPhones

It’s 499 pound
I upgraded from a 6S to 11

Which idiot at Apple took away the HOME BUTTON every time you open phone the screen is full of stuff you don’t want e. g the last sites apps I used. I know what I used, I used them, I don’t need to be told. The other is SIRI RECOMENDATIONS. if I want something I’ll look it up. Apple have gone from the best phone ever iphone7 to the worst iphone11. I will gladly swop this thing for an iphone7. Poor decision to trade my 7 for an 11

I looked at the video quality settings and it said 4K when this display is less than 1080P

I upgraded from an iPhone 5S to the 11, I kinda like it?

Pixel 3 definitely had the best camera I agree while now having a pixel 4 this pixel is the worst made

I have the 5 se sooo I need an upgrade

I badly need a new phone. My iPhone 7 is bad. Wish I could afford it.

Iphone 11 vs one plus 8 can anyone help?

I’m getting this phone this week upgrading from the 7plus

I went from no phone to the iPhone 11

Debating if i should which to iPhone from Android. what do you guys think ?

this is my first phone. im 14

Still using my iPhone 11 in October 2021. It’s in a black camo dbrand skin (back and camera) and then I have a Tech21 Pure Clear case over top. It’s a fantastic setup.. really glad I bought it outright so I own it. Got it 15 months ago and it’s still running strong and taking pictures that punch wayyy above its weight-class. Love it.Edit: forgot, of course a tempered glass also. Original one I put on way back and it’s just an extra from a 3-pack from iPhone XR pack my sister had. Face ID, WiFi 6 and having the U1 chip make it the perfect pretty current setup. Still best bang for buck if buying new direct from Apple.

I’m upgrading from an Samsung A20 to an IPhone 11, I hope it’s worth it!!

“Hey what’s up guys I’m Kim PhD here” captions at its finest

Slo-fies

Do any one feel when you watch an tech vid you take off you case I do I get it if I’m lonely 2 year old looking back

Too easy? It&#39;s actually more likely to be &#39;too obvious&#39;.

Ok

Can I watch a 1080p video on yt?

Going from a 7 to an 11... wow this is a change

Bruh i can&#39;t believe that The iphone 11 is 2 years old

I got a iphone 11 for 430$ with coupons ✌️

The iPhone 13 has just been released… the iPhone 11 has now dropped to $499. I think that as of October 1, 2021, the iPhone 11 is the best bang for your buck out of the entire lineup.

2 years ago time flew.

Still loving my Iphone 11 ☺️

i&#39;m watching this in 2021. price dropped under 50k but still i can&#39;t afford this phone🤣😅

I think I want to upgrade from my 7 to an 11- But the youtube thing is kinda disappointing. Though I suppose as long as the pictures you take yourself and other images/videos are high quality, it&#39;s not that bad.

Anybody else came after iPhone 13?
Okay, got it. 😋

Which one should I get &#39;Iphone 11&#39; or &#39;Iphone 12 pro max&#39;? HELP ME!!!!!😩

This is where I come to know how the product/device  is.

buyest.

How about a giveaway

I know the iphone 13 is coming out this month but I&#39;m getting the iphone 11 soon and I&#39;m 13 playing for it all my self and I&#39;m so excited I just need to save up a little more

This is my goal for this year before it ends I hope I get a new one!

Where is the SIM card slot

Who’s watching this on an iPhone 6 😂

Just upgraded from 6s Plus to 11 three days ago.😍 Man, I love it! Perfect timing indeed since I made a purchase just in time the iPhone 13 made a debut. Got mine on a price similar to what the XR was last week.

Can i have your old iphone? I really need a new phone my iphone 6 already have green lines on my screen

Me watching with an iPhone 11

Genuine question: does he make good/genuine reviews without the effects of sponsorships?

Bought an 11 just yesterday. $499. From their website. They are allowing people to rob them. Also you said 64gb should be upgraded from. Honestly i&#39;m upgrading from a Asus Z00ed for 6 years. I have always had under 10gb of storage this upgrade is over 6 times better. Everything is worse on my current phone. Can&#39;t wait for it to arrive.

Should i get this phone over my iphone se 2?? Any thoughts guys

How reliable is the 11?

Need help the bottom left side of my phone has 3 for circles and the right has 5 is it fake ?

I got my green iPhone 11 in 2019 🥺I&#39;m going to keep it as long as I can. This green is the best colour

The iPhone 11 is $499 now.

I’m late but mine is coming in it’s red

Everyone’s excited about the long battery life, but wait till you try the Nokia 3210

Belts an A5

Love From INDIA, KERALA ♥️⚡
One year later and iphone 11 is still around $800(₹56,000)  here in India pfffftttt

Please gift me a iPhone 11 😊

watching it in iphone 11 😅🤍

IT HAS 1GB MORE RAM THAN XR :3

Every “new iPhone” review shouldn’t take any longer than 1 minute. It’s always the same lame ass design since the iPhone X.

Koodo has the 11 for $480 bucks right now 🤯 $0 downFirst apple for me 😬

Worst display by Apple

I have an iPhone 6 and thinking about getting the 11. I had to charge my phone about 5 times in a day because it dies regardless if it was on or not. I hope the 11 is much better than the 6.

Me watching the video using iPhone 11

I went from a 6S plus to an 8Plus

I just got one…. I smashed my xr so I got the 11 since the 12 dosnt hold a lot more value over this phone imo, and I didn’t want the pro since it’s smaller….. but the 11 pro max is too much

yo buy me one  🥺
Me watching this on my moto x4 from 2017😭😭

So......no description about Wide and U Wide as far as FStop etc?

Thank you! I&#39;m getting this phone on Wednesday!

Did you just call me poor for 8 minutes straight

i went from uncircumcised to circumcised. The changes are intense

It’s crazy how this phone looks dated compared to the iPhone 12. I think the 12 is the best iPhone since the iPhone 5. The design is amazing.

I call iPhone 11 the XR Deluxe Edition

Can this phone be hack ? Cause I experienced my phone being hack so can this phone be hack

im dissapointed because i got an android instead of iphone because it has &quot;more storage&quot; when you can buy an iphone 11 with 512 gigabites

What&#39;s the price

Upgraded from 6s to 11 today, lets see what it brings

BASE? What a stupid thing to say...

Just bought my 11 purple on EBay for $500 cash (tip - always PAY CASH for everything.)  Definitely a step up from my iPhone 5S! haha! I&#39;m a  likin&#39; it.

I always upgraded every year but stopped at the 8+ and I upgraded to the 12 pro max feels way different

Hey bro can you give away this iphone 11 to me ppppllllllllllllzzzzzzzzz

I’m going from a iPhone SE to this and I can already tell my mind is going to be boggled

I Have 11😊

Come on man that&#39;s not iphone ten it&#39;s ex. Damn son!

It ain’t a super easy phone to buy😔

Pff... I want a iPhone 11 or 10 for free I can&#39;t afford it... plss I live in Belgium.

will you pls gift me one iphone 11 pls 😊🙂

Just bought the iPhone 11 yesterday , it’s fckn amazing and I love it already !!!

markus : huh an iphone.u can buy this one its done

My family&#39;s mentality is;You can have your new phone IF your old phone is broken or not working anymore.I like iphone but my family likes Android✅✅

I had a iphone 11 in that exact color but that broke and I just now got a new phone and I love it. I got a Galaxy S21 Ultra. Massive Upgrade.

Isn't Malayalee cool 💥💥💥💥
I just got my new IPhone 11 after having the Samsung J6 plus for 3 years

I went from an iPhone SE (1st gen) to an iPhone 11! There are many life changing differences between the two phones.

planning  to go from 6 to 11. I am getting crazy over no more space and slow phone, besides apps no more supporting 6

When I bought the 11, I honestly did not check out the specs, I was using a 10 with an OLED screen and after buying the 11 right at the store, I said to myself why does the display look like that, but didn’t think much of it until I went home and saw that nah, the 10 screen looks better than this, then I googled it and realize that the 11 has an LCD screen, which I found crazy. I wouldn’t have expected that.

Super easy to like🙃

Your videos makes my iphone 11 quality look good
Praise the lord

&quot;Its a solid improvement over the XR&quot;the only difference is one more camera, 1 hour more better, same water resistance. Not worth the upgrade lmao. If you got the XR, you shouldn&#39;t upgrade till the 15 or 16 lmao

Kha sa
Hello

Bro I love your videos
Huhuhu..I really want that kind 0f phone🤗🤗🤗🤗🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
this is gonna be my 1st iphone in a few days

compared to the xr what’s the weight like??

I got it at T-mobile for 50% off in 2021 at 300 dollars a total steal

lmao..perfect review. I&#39;m still using the 6.

My favourite gadget in 2021 list… hope to save so many memories in my new n dashing iPhone 11.. Thank you Apple!

Is it better to rnuy iphone 11 even in 2021 when we have s21

Already watched this video Twice from the 1st second to 490 second with no double tap

Also the fact that the XR is made with steel, that’s why it’s the same size and weight despite the fact it has a smaller battery and less camera

torn between this and the android a12

Thinking about upgrading from my LG Stylo 5 to IPhone 11. Thoughts?

Have anyone else here replied to someone&#39;s comment, or anyone&#39;s social media account for that matter, and then they blocked you all of the sudden?

He said easy so much I started hearing “ezy”

Huawei has way better cameras in cheaper phones what are you on lol

I&#39;m growing up in the world. Goin to college with my new 11. Sick

Probably getting lost in a sea of comments in a year old video, but....What do ppl who actually have this think of the display?  Is it really a problem?  I currently have an lg stylo 5, and even it has a way better display -- at least specs wise.  Not sure if I should spend a few more for the iphone 12, because I hear that one does not do as well battery wise and even Mr. Brownlee here showed the easy scratches on it.

Upgraded to the iPhone 12 Pro Max after using the iPhone 11 for a year. I am a massive Apple Sheep but Just going to say (from my own experience) this is possibly the worst iPhone I’ve ever used and I’ve been using iOS since iPhone 4S back in 2011. Just didn’t sit right with me

Evolution of iphone 5c :1.iphone 5c2.iphone xr 3.iphone 11

from iPhone SE 1st generation, i just upgraded to iPhone 11. quite huge upgrade

Jesus is the only way to Heaven pursue Him today

Hope i get some reply ... Would you recommended this phone over S20 fe sd version ?Edit/update: wanted to get Fe but due to stock out of S20fe i got a op 8t 12/256.There&#39;s wasn&#39;t a single fe in my whole fking country

My 100 dollars phone is jealous...

One year and some change later,  I’m making the upgrade and chose an 11.  Your video was informative.  Glad I made my choice 💫

man i wish i can get this phone :/

Im going from a 6s to an 11, bro this phone is huge. Battery doesnt fucking run out oml

Loved the intro! 🤣

this is the first phone im gonna buy all by myself and im so excited EDIT: i ended up waiting and my mom bought me the 13 for christmas

I like that intro, it’s churchy 💙

I think the worst part about the 11 is the LED screen while the base X had an OLED. Rediculous that they went back to the old tech for a flagship. The screen just is not as sharp as the X and that is not OK.

The lesson here is that everything was easier in 2019.

i got it

How much was this phone when it came out ? When new models come out does the price drop?

Him: holds the phone over stairs My heart : <b>I&#39;m alive but I&#39;m dead</b>Me: brother is trying to kill me

Is it bad to use a non apple adapter to charge this phone ?

Watching this on an iPhone 12 Pro makes me realize I watch a lot of these 😂

iphone 11 is lot more SAME!!!

I like this guy. No bullshit.

I don&#39;t like the OLED from 11 pro or 12 pro display it feels like an Android phone. I like my usual LCD!

Price is too easy to 😂😂

Wait you can’t watch HD videos!?? How is this possible??

Cool

I still don&#39;t understand why the x, xs, and 12 have oled but not the 11?

My dads iphone (my dad has a huawei phone) : iphone 5 (yes he still uses it)My moms and i: IPHONE 11 VROM VROM LOL LOL HA

The defeated edge empirically drip because imprisonment significantly hate worth a remarkable bench. curvy, keen keyboarding

Is it worth enough to buy iphone 11 in 2021?

Shifted from 6s to 11 and it’s like a heaven lol😂 Really super cool❤️

I went from lg sylo 4 to an iphone 11😏

Easiest comment I have ever commented

It&#39;s 2021 and I bought the iPhone 11. Switched after being with Android for a good 5 years. Got a good deal with my carrier on it.  Love the simplicity and also don&#39;t really care for OLED displays on the Pros or 12s (LCD hurts my eyes less lmao).

Those who are thinking about buying  an iphone after getting a descent job near future, dude u never gonna make it. I saw these reviews each every days. Switching the video to base model to SE to 8,7 so on. If u cant afford now, when you will be able to afford, then surrounding responsibilities will never allow you to spend suck kind of money on a phone. So go and watch videos on how to live on a little expense. Take love.

I really want to get iphone 11 but i do  not have money

Anyone know how much it is now?

R u rich
Watching Video Of Iphone And Using Android!  😂😆

I got the XR last year and the screen was terrible this year i had to choose between the XS and the 11 (as thry have the same price here) and I choose the XS for it s screen and it s portrait mode

Just bought myself an iPhone 11 last night and it&#39;s coming the 29th. First time ever getting an iPhone, been using Androids my whole life. Also just my first time purchasing my own phone instead of my family getting me crappy phones. Can&#39;t wait to get it 😁Currently have a Pixel 3a, got it as a graduation gift for anyone curious. It&#39;s an amazing phone for how cheap it was, probably gonna give it to my mother. He&#39;s right, the pixel 3 has an amazing camera.

I love 😻 iPhone ☹️
went from a samsung j7 to an iphone 11, the difference is life changing!

i am going from android to apple iphone 11 :)

Is this even worth it for a 720p display

In this day and age, why would anyone in their right mind buy a $700 phone that won&#39;t allow you to watch HD YouTube videos 😒

Display is the worst part of the product. One of the most dumb trade off you can have in the Iphone

gonna buy this with my $timmy check

I Love watching thingsThat I can&#39;t afford 🙂

I went from a 7 to an 11 because that is what the company I work for wanted to do.The 11 is a piece of CRAP.  Larger for no reason, I now can&#39;t fit it in my phone pocket that I have been using for the past 20 years.  Now I have place to put it.Second all this move it to turn it on crap is really annoying until I found out how to turn it off.THIRD.  Question.  When do you need the flashlight?  When its dark.  The phone will not let you turn on the flashlight when its dark because there is no light shining on the phone (some kind of secret &quot;leave me alone&quot; function when you lie the phone on its glass).  So the only way you can turn the phone one and off when you are in the dark is through Siri which works really great when you are trying to be quiet about it.I have missed calls and texts randomly because it just won&#39;t make a sound when they come in.The company sent an Otterbox case with it.  No screen protector, so after only 1 week I have a nice scratch in the screen.4Th.  Swiping out of and turning off what you are using is overly complicated.It seem like every time they come out with a new version, the &quot;keystrokes&quot; go from 1 or 2 to 3p  or four, for no real reason.

I mean tbh, most people won&#39;t care about the specs because it&#39;s a new iphone, their gonna be like &quot;oh a new iPhone, I gotta get it&quot;

Thinking of going from an iphone 7 to an 11. So had to see what Marcus had to say heh

linkara

i think i&#39;m gonna get one!

About to switch from the 7 to the 11 and sheesh my battery might actually last longer than 3 hours. Also Liquid Retina HD display 🔥🔥

iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 11

Someone answer me this. Why does the iPhone 7 Plus have a higher screen resolution than the iPhone 11? I find this absurd. iPhone 7 Plus 1920-by-1080-pixel resolution at 401 ppi and the iPhone 11 1792-by-828-pixel resolution at 326 ppi

Lmao so easy everything I am buying the red 😂. Because I can&#39;t buy buy a phone that is over 1k dollors. I just don&#39;t see myself spending that much on a phone. Not because I can&#39;t but because I don&#39;t want to because is overpriced for no reason. And is LCD screen display. Like wtf I am only buying this phone because of the nightmode. That&#39;s what I need mostly. In a phone right now

I am a simple human I saw Marques review and buy the iPhone.

Iphone 11 lovers like the comment😌❤️🔥🙌🏻

I recommend DHTECHZ on lG for your iPhone unlocking

I bought an iPhone 11 from this guy but reaching home I got to know it was locked with icloud. So I came here searching for who to help me unlocking it. But I was later then referred to this DHTECHZ on lG who helped me unlocking my phone. I&#39;m so happy

Maybe iphone 12 pro max is just a lesson because mama and papa can&#39;t buy that, because they don&#39;t have a salary when they work I dreamed of getting an iphone I hope you can see it from the phillipines🥺

i just buy this iphone it&#39;s amazing i love it specially the black color 🖤

Ok my question is when ppl say they end the day on roughly 25 % with the iPhone 11 is it with “Low Power Mode” ON or with it OFF. Ending the day on 25 % only happens with it Low Power Mode on for me and I wonder if this is ok. I got my BRAND NEW phone on Saturday January 23, 2021 and I made this post on Tuesday January 26, 2021.

Let’s be honest who doesn’t come to Marques before getting a new phone lmao

Sorry please.. do you use all the phones you buy or you give them out.... Cause they are too much 😂😂

love from BD

Here’s a question: iPhone 11 gets hot when charging from the original 20-watt adapter and the original new cord (with type C (new configuration). It’s better to charge it with a new charger (with type C) or with an original, but old charger (in terms of, the fact that it is more than a year old) with a USB and 1-amp adapter?
Iphone is problably the only brand in the world that sell same shit at more and more expensive prices. Good job, Apple for brain wash your clients. Same design, same speakers, same screen, same shit!!!

<a href="">3:00</a> Bro, he said the &quot;T H I C C N E S S&quot; 💀😂

I’m getting one been saving for ages

watching on my s8+ that can watch youtube videos in UHD, unlike the 700$ iPhone that has an iPhone 4 display.

I can’t wait to buy one! I have an iPhone 6s 16GB for almost 3 years, and I’ve been struggling with the storage and it’s frustrating 🌚

I went from a rock to an iPhone 15 the only thing is , when I Throw it , the phone doesn’t hurt the person it just breaks its self , .. but the change is revolutionary.

Idc what anyone says iphone 8plus and 5s will still be the best iphones apple made along eith the se

me watching this on my iphone 12: &quot;so glad I waited one more year&quot;

Should&#39;ve given an amoled display

Any android users there

I wanna buy an iphone 11 but I can&#39;t decide between black and white, also i&#39;m kinda scared cause I have a samsung s7 now and i had samsung my whole life and i really don&#39;t know what to expect. Can anyone that switched from android to iphone tell me their opinion to help me?

Lol &quot;I like my phones naked&quot;
I went from iSamsung SXR to the iPhone 11! Difference is massive

Help! Which one should I get; the 11 or XS max?

I went from my iPhone 12 Pro Max to an iPhone 11, this is amazing.

The best camera? Really? Its incredibly not true, incredibly far from reality!

Sadly my cameara has issues. Anyone else has problems with it? Really disappointed.

Omg she THIC! 🤭
<a href="">0:25</a> That’s when the video should have ended 😂

I don’t know if I should get the iPhone 11 or the iPhone X. Someone help me choose. Thanks!

People who bought their iPhone 11’s a while ago. How’s the battery going now? Everyone here saying the battery was great coming from an iPhone 6 or something, but all phone have good battery when they first get them. So honest review on battery? Thanks

just got the 11 after accidentally running over my old phone 🥲😂

90% of the comments be likeI switched my gender and the differences are huge

I’m watching this run on a 11 from a 200 dollar Samsung. The changes are intense...

Holy

Just Now Ordered an iPhone 11. So Watching This..

Me watching on iphone12 pro

This is gonna be my first phone that’s not second hand, can’t wait till it arrives

I JUST GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS TODAY!!

does anybody else get anxiety when he holds the phone over those stairs

Now I know why people are recommending Madeeasyhack he&#39;s good at any hacking tools chat him up on IG

Wow I just upgraded from a nokia without touchscreen and I could only call and write SMS to an iphone 11. THE difference is huge!!!! What an amazing phone!!!-Every iphone user.

I thought I lost my phone but with the help of Madeeasyhack I got my iCloud password back, he’s the best on Instagram

i got the iphone 11 after having the iphone 8 plus. I was a little dissepointed that it was a bit smaller than the iphone 8 plus.. and the front camera is very blurry-like.. especially  on snapchat!  BUT beside that i lovee it

I’m getting that on 28 day luv it lol

Iphone 11 or xs max ?????

I just got my iPhone 11 today and I opened the gift with my iphone 11 in

Who else watching this on a iPhone 11 ?

Samsung ad right before the apple review well done google

Why does no one like my comments

Now its 599$I think its the best in this price

I am using this phone, also I use dual SIM (China Virson),please let me know have any quality problems with others countrys.

Im getting mine tomorrow 😭✊🏼

The fact that he can rock his phone “naked” is unbelievable(I can’t)

I have iphone 12 pro

I should’ve gotten green

Held out as long as I could Had the 6s For yearsGlad I waited for the 11 got it for a great price

Santa better come in clutch

Watching this on IPhone 11 is so satisfying 😗

My sister got one and I thought that was the best screen I have seen on a iPhone

Me watching this in an iPhone 11 😐

I wanted the iPhone 11, then my Grandpa surprised me with the iPhone 12!

I am buying the 256GB for 750£ on Christmas!!So excited!!

I subscribe you because my idol is Justin brownlee played for PBA

Getting the 11 for christmas yay

I love mine. I have an 11 pro max also. I use them both. I also have a galaxy note 20 ultra. Both of my iPhone 11 and 11 pro max are white

the iphone 11 is so pretty 🥺

DOPE

I went from a samsung note 5 to an 11 the changes were insane

Im so stupid. Iphone mugs off their buyers yk and i had an iphone 7 plus and apple watch etc got bored then switched to samsung s10 plus now im getting the iphone 11 🤣🥺

Just bought one off Mercari for $450, new 128GB variant. Best steal of my life.

Lost my OnePlus 7t pro today 😭 Gotta buy this one soon

<a href="">3:01</a> - mmmmm he be thiccccccccc

I’m just so sad. I thought I made a great investment in my new phone. I didn’t  get the iPhone 12 or the pro 11 because the so-called sales dude - who on another note wasn’t wearing his mask except below his gross nostrils whereas he was coughing and even after I expressed my concern didn’t pull up his mask. I’m not a “KAREN.”  I’m a responsible person who expects an easy to use phone without classes and AT&amp;T doing nothing this far to help me. Still having issues with just copying and pasting. On my latest phone - an iPhone 8 - it was so easy. Now I’m frustrated that I can’t copy and paste as I used to do. I bought this phone on July 7, 2020. I also am experiencing ridiculous pauses and the phone’s inability to hone into free or different WiFi’s. I’m not stupid. I am a professional journalist and will make a bigger deal about this of someone doesn’t get a hold of me ASAP.

Did the 11 have front-facing portrait mode? :o

i might get one ..... i have a iphone 6 . This might be a change .

My iphone 11 gives me 8-10 Sot It’s cameras are absolutely sick and I couldn’t be happier!! This thing is absolutely a beast and... I like and love APPLE AND ANDROID! Nuff said B^)

They should update the water resistance by one so it’s nice

I like &quot;big&quot; phones. I&#39;m glad I waited to purchase this device until after the 12 came out. It&#39;s a great phone and definitely is arguably just as good as the iPhone 12 in my opinion.

This is the only latest iphone that comes in yellow, so i bought it.

That logo on our shirt looks like a prostate :))). Anyway, good video ;)

This iPhone 11 is a dust magnet. If I can&#39;t figure out a way to stop dust from collecting on this phone, it&#39;s going back to Best Buy on Tuesday. It is insane how much dust collects on the back and front glass and all over the camera lenses..  If dust gets inside those lenses...buh bye phone.

Getting one in two days, gonna be a huge upgrade going from the 7 to the 11

All the people who updated to newer version can you donate me the older versions 😅

Dad just upgraded from 6 to this!

I have the iPhone 7 but I’m getting the 11 soon. How much better is the 11?

you&#39;re better than technical Guruji

ALL YOU DUMBASS PEOPLE WHO STILL HAD A 6S AND JUMPED TO 11 DUHHHHHHH ITS GONE LAST LONGER APPLE ADMITTED TO THE BATTERY IN THE 6-6S WAS FUCKED

So basically nothing here special

Best

Oh my goodness, I need to watch more of your reviews!! I have an iPhone 11 right now, I’m upgrading to the 12 pro max in a few weeks, but I had no idea that I wasn’t watching YouTube videos in 1080p!! This video, I even went in and selected the highest video quality option and I was thinking to myself “this looks ... the same ...?” 🤣🤣🤣 I don’t even know who would be to blame for that, YouTube or Apple! Either way, I’m so excited to have a bigger and better screen!! 😍🔥💪🏾

I went from the 6s to the 11, the only differences that I felt are both battery and camera got better. Just that.

Does anyone remember the swipe left to unlock

What’s the intro song? <a href="">0:00</a>

I feel so bad for people who jumped to the iPhone 11! The iPhone 12 is SO MUCH BETTER LOL

Loved the intro music 🎶

Just bought a “used” one by a person who alway has to upgrade to the newest phone. I paid 400 bucks and I’m stoked!! Buy them for 400 from someone trying to upgrade (apple only offers them 350 gift card or trade in for it!)

<a href="">0:56</a> same shitp

When you came from iPhone 6s PlusOmg the speed and the battery

im going from samsung galaxy j6 to iphone 11. amazing quality jump

<b>i upgraded from my Nokia 3310 to an iphone 11 and the difference is small</b>

It sucks. Figure out how to make the screen full without hardware in the way. Last apple for me. This is a a advertisement.

He made me excited 😁😁 again, @clemshack_ on Instagram, fix my  locked iPhone without any delay

He made me excited 😁😁 again, @clemshack_ on Instagram, fix my  locked iPhone without any delay

I just upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone 11 and I’m so happy with it rn!

I just did a test with the iPhone 11 there’s only one camera at the top one If you block the bottom and then you go to the camera feature does not work. The second camera must just be a sensor

Why am i here when i cant afford it

We should call it iphone xrs

the thing is that i love the size and the price on the iphone 11 however i don&#39;t like the screen resolution which is a big deal with me but the iphone 11 standard size is the perfect sweet spot for me and there isn&#39;t an iphone that is the same size and also has a greater resolution screen which i don&#39;t like so i am currently in a predicament here. i don&#39;t know what to do at this point can someone help me...

Who remembers when apple was in the lead by so far compared to the samsungs and androids of its time

Black iPhone is the best

T H I C C N E S S

So cheap in America
<a href="">0:58</a> MKBHD&#39;s subtle flex of owning a Tesla..

I went from iPhone 7 Plus to a iPhone 11 and I like it

What&#39;s going on with the format this video is played? the video player is smaller than usual and it&#39;s only on his MKBHD.

I got the iPhone 7plus &amp; I just ordered the iPhone 11 because why not? 🤷🏾‍♀️

I never believed wayne_purple on IG  could helped me track  my stolen iPhone  even after i saw his recommendation  but surprisingly He did 😗

Watching this on my MacBook Pro 2012.lol

Does the iPhone 11 have a good enough display to play 4k videos or can it just record in 4k?

Thanks I&#39;m a android guy . I just switched to iphone after all these years . I&#39;m still adjusting

had to flex the tesla app

Nice phone, will watch this again 2yrs later when i can actually buy the phone

iPhone tech nerds help me out here. I know nothing about I phones and I want one that has the best camera quality out there. Please help me out as I’m going shopping for one in a couple days

I&#39;m getting this phone today

Thanks, I&#39;ll buy it

Went from samsung s8 to iphone11

Who’s here in2020

MARKASS BROWNLEE

lol that surfboard flex in the first frame

I got this phone a month ago, upgraded from an LG Escape 2. I was never really into phones that much but I&#39;m really digging this thing. Got it in black with a nice sturdy black case.

It’s so simple!Gonna get this to replace my iPhone SE 1st gen.

who is here after the iphone 12 dropped lol

<a href="">0:16</a> now it’s the most sold phone of 2020 so far

Check out <b>cabletoolz</b> 0n lnsta, dude is a genius he helped unlocking my iCloud I’m very happy. You should check him out. He unlocked my device in less than an hour

May i ask : I never had a Iphone before and this one is so tempting but is the 326 PPI ok? Like can we see the pixels easily? (I&#39;m curently on a 294 PPI phone btw and it&#39;s so boring)

I wish i can afford that.

How many of you got recommended for this video after 2 months of iPhone 12 released! and watched it completed! Man please give me a iPhone 11 Pro Max

Should i buy this 11 in 2021? How many years can j use it?

Am I the only one that watches a lot of videos whenever I get a new phone 😭

muselk

Which color should i get ? Black or white

Seems like everyone has this phone now

Hi there Marques,Can you also review the mid-range phones? please?

What about the heating problem??does happen to your phone?

Who else has the white iPhone 11🙈😁?

With these reviews I know many people that are really into tech know the differences from generation to generation but many people upgrading (me) are using older phones by several generations. Just some constructive criticism/feedback. I&#39;d really like to see a spec run down more in depth of the features even if they are just slight iterations. I just bought this phone from upgrading from my 7 (which I still really like) and am looking for a more detailed rundown and review of the phone. Just my 2¢

when Iphone 3g costs 2000 $

This seriously was an amazing video and I never watch phone videos lol don&#39;t know how this ended up in my feeds but I&#39;m glad it did

Any chance you still have this? This is exactly what I want 🤞🏼🤞🏼

The display is the best in the world

I&#39;m here after the launch of the 12, mainly cause in my country they are hella expensive phones, like SERIOUSLY expensive. Iphone 11 price didn&#39;t drop, here, but the 12 certainly comes with a much higher price. Is this color, the green one, let&#39;s say, manly? I like it, but I&#39;m not sure I could live with it for too long, idk, it&#39;s kind very pastel, but somehow I keep looking at it and want it

I just bought this phone since its only 599 now as a secondary phone to my primary galaxy note 10+ i hope i dont regret it, i just want to use facetime since all my friends and have iphones

jason derulo
If you zoom in on the camera is it blurry?

Watching on my iPhone 11😍

i updated from iphone 6s plus to iphone 11 ..... this is a huge update to me

They just took 7s off the shelf but I love my iPhone 11 just got it 2 days ago on a deal an it’s been awesome

I’m going  from “7/11”

The quality of your camera is just amazing, I feel like I see better your videos than real life

i went from a iPhone 6 to a iPhone 11 hugeeeee difference

For gaming bro please give one best i phone

Please give one I phone please

🍎🍎Wow!
great video

I want a iphone 11 so bad but have to wait till my bday next year

Anyone here bc Apple dropped the price of Iphone 11 xddddd

Chal Oo bondya

Just got mine today and the wide angle is amazing  !

Great video!! Thanks for the info 😊

man his dislike number is also 4K... lol.

I bought the black colour and I love this phone already, it has one of the best battery life ever

Did anyone know that the iPhone 8 Plus in most stores besides apple don&#39;t have them like boost mobile when I call and ask they say they don&#39;t have them and that&#39;s at all stores so tbh I think they stopped making the iPhone 8 Plus.

LOL.

im going from 7  to an 11 and mines coming tmrw!!!!

The fact that he walked around with a phone with no case made me so nervous😂😂😂

I just got this phone today upgrading from a 7. Definitely loving it

Hi

For a simple guy like me, this phone makes a whole lot of sense. It’s even cheaper after 12 came out. What i need is a phone which is reliable, fast and practical. At $599, this phone makes total sense. Even more, it will easily last 3+ years.

<a href="">0:06</a> iPhone XR I’m the background watching its life get ruined

<b>me looking in the description fir that case he had</b>

Me watching this in 2020 on a moto g5 from Tesco’s

i just got my 11 like 4 days ago and i haven’t hit 20% battery yet it’s kinda insane lmao great phone so far

<a href="">3:01</a> anyone noticed?

Where did u buy that T-shirt?

Same

I care a lot about the quality of the screen. And... this screen is of a great quality.

I wanted that iphone case so bad

Watching this video on 11 is funny.

Omg I’m going from my 7 to the 11, my 7 is so good tho negl. It’s the best thing ever, I’ve never had any issues with it whatsoever

I&#39;m going from an X to an 11, but I feel like the display downgrade will hurt, a lot.

This is not a lie o have an iPhone six s plus the screen falling off lags every 5 min and also dies in one hour and the charger did nkt work

HAHAHA YOU TOLD 2020 WILL HAVE MAJOR UPDATES BROOO LOLOL

rochyrd
I went from 7 to SE than SE to iPhone 11 for now &amp; I really love the iPhone 11

Finally upgrading from SE I just hate spending so much money but it’s time.. getting it in red can’t wait 😁

I think iPhone 11 looks great 👍

Just a info. Marques iPhone XR had IP67 water and dust resistance and not IP68

You should have less subs.

Watching this to see if I should get a new iPhone or the z flip, there’s way too many pros &amp; cons for each.

Me: taking notes to show to my parents to help me get money for this phone 😂 😂 😂 😂

i just upgraded from a 7 to an 11 a few days ago and there is a HUGE improvement in performance and battery usage.

99% of people in the comment section: “Just upgraded from my IPhone 4 to an IPhone 11!”Me: T H I C C N E S S

iphone 11 is cheap for me even though im broke..maybe its bc of my parents 🤭

Who is here after buying 11 from Amazon sale?

Great video, i have come from iPhone 7 Plus to the 11

i went from the pea sized se to the 11 and its amazinggggg

My mom and sister bought me this phone for my 18th birthday and im so happy with it ! my old phone was iPhone 7 plus .

Guys, girls, I have an iPhone 11. If you would like to inquire about it and ask about my experience for 10 months, send me a message on my Instagram account.

Has it seriously been a year already

Whose here after iphone 12 😆
Who is here after Amazon great Indian sale offer.😁😁😁

Guys Maybe tomorrow i will buy it Can you play heavy game on it! how long the battery lasts??

The fact that this was a YEAR ago- time flew

Viewers : whats new Mkbhd : THE NAME

so much has happened since this video

I want a iPad Pro 2020

His t-shirt is a kidney symbolizing the price.

I went from a 3 to an 12 pro. The changes are intense. I didn&#39;t know a battery could last this long

Back here after the iphone 12 launch and looks like they are alternating the innovation. Maybe iphone 13 will be revolutionary coz iphone 12 certainly isint. Not thinking much just getting the 11 now 😊

It&#39;s for sale now in India at a very good price.

should i upgrade xs to 11? net cost after selling xs is free....pls reccomend

Me watching this on my galaxy S9 wondering whether i should switch.......

Question: is it better to have an ultra wide and wide lenses or wide and telephoto lenses. I ask because I’m debating whether to get an iPhone 11 or just keep my XS Max.

Finally iPhone 12 is here, Hey MKBHD!!! Can u rename the title and repost the video with bugs fixes😂😂

So you can shoot in 4k? But no 4k screen? I mean I don&#39;t care much about phone specs, cause at the end of the day it&#39;s just a phone....but come on Apple you can legit AFFORD TO NOT BE LAZY N CHEAP

Since iphone 12 is out so now this one will be available at less price so now i will own it

Same but from 6s to 11.

<a href="">7:45</a> coming from 2020, it isn&#39;t that heavy bro

Just ordered the 11 so I’m watching this

Is it as easy to recommend the 12 now over the 11?

Who else is there to decide whether or not they really need the new iPhone 12?

Watching this on 13.10.2020  while the iPhone 12 is getting launched 😉

Don&#39;t know why YouTube recommend this video just 2hr before the iPhone 12 launch! Time for a price drop maybe 😂😂

<a href="">7:47</a> Not a year actually, A few hours to go for new iPhone 12 series, I&#39;m excited for the launch event

dark phoenix trailer

Which iPhone should I buy?- iPhone XR- iPhone 11Need you guys.

acneremoval

I wish I can edit this comment and say that I got this phone..

I got the 7 used and it doesn’t seem the battery lasts very long but I do love it

t h i c c n e s s
Upgraded from 6s to 11

coming from Android, I have to say that I’ve never taken more accidental screenshots on any other phone than the iPhone 11.

I went from a 2005 flip phone to an iPhone 11, MAJOR difference! 🤯

It is IP67 nit IP68

which color to go for ? green or purple or red ?

yeah get one fast charger , then you&#39;ll forgot everthing about oneplus.

Really love this phone! I’ve got the green iPhone 11 as well, one of my absolute favourite phone colours! The cameras are incredible and the screen looks excellent! I’ve got pretty much nothing to complain about on this thing.

watching this from my superior  mi10 ultra

Whose watching on i phone 11 hit like

Everyone - going from 6 to 11Me - will be going from X to 12 pro !

Basically half of my class use iPhone 11

Went from Huawei P30 to iPhone 11

Anyone else just watching reviews on the phone knowing they won&#39;t ever get it but happy someone out there probably got there&#39;s today

Most people should buy aka rich people un like me

I went from the first iphone to and iphone 11 huge difference

I upgraded from an iPhone 9 To iPhone 11 Pro Max Plus S Lite 2

Nice, I am waiting for next one👍👍👍👍🇮🇳🇮🇳
Right I got the iPhone 11 my first ever iPhone and it’s working damn great for me

The update for iPhone 11 is garbage.

Red black or green

Just got one for free today. I didn&#39;t pay attention to this video a year ago so here to I&#39;m to watch it again and try to learn more about this phone but I guess I&#39;ll have to go further back and watch the iPhone XR review video, don&#39;t I?

i think this iPhone is good for this price

well, I am upgrading from an Iphone 6 to an Iphone 11 tomorrow, wow

Went from a ipod to 11

Everytime I watched this. I just get jealous because I can&#39;t really afford this beautiful phone! 🥺😫

I upgraded from i6 to i11

I gotta say I have a Samsung they are good but iphone they look really nice except the notch and price

me still using iphone 7, waiting for iphone 12 to be reviewed so that I can see it and wait for iphone 13

5s to 7+ to 11

My mom is going to get me a iphone 11 in my birthday

I think I&#39;ll go from 7 to 11

Should I buy this against samsung s20 FE

At last chanhing my 5s to 11🤤❤️
okayy ii see u...;.
Is this an upgrade over the iPhone 7 Plus?? Only thing holding me back is the screen specs...?

Cries in nokia 2.2

Yeah I don’t notice the screen resolution. Especially as my Wi-Fi only gives me 480p. No cap

I like to keep my iPhone naked too. The difference is that I can’t financially afford that. So I don’t do that

One Year Later.....Still no iPhone 12???

Still with my iPhone 9and he&#39;s still keep pretty nice tv signal

I have used my frnds Xr so i quiet like that diplay so I&#39;ll go for the 11

went from 6s to 11, insane

Hey marques. In your mind its ok to i upgrade my iPhone xs256G to iphone 1164G?Please answer my question.

I bought that skin straight away, 11 months after this video came out. Looked so damn good on my 720p display

Compared my 11 to my 5 and the screen is the bigger than the 5. I don’t know how I could ever have used it

I am the biggest fan of Apple iPhone . But it’s funny how Apple robs  its customer. Did u know iPhone XR share same screen as the iPhone 11 .  Ur paying extra for old product hehehe

I moved from 11 Pro max to 11 I love the colors

I need a phone recommendation from you. Should I leave Android s10 for I phone?

How these huge phones look comfortably small in your hands just blows my mind.

I  have dream to buy iphone 11 but middle class i cannot buying a i phone 😭😭

I switched from an iPhone 8 plus to iPhone 11, first day I thought that the iPhone 11 zoom camera was with technical problems but later I realize that the zoom is worse than iphone 8 plus, my second feeling was the screen quality, if you swapped from an iPhone 8 Plus to iPhone 11 you will notice the difference, the quality of the 11 is lower though is brighter!

Would have been the perfect phone if it had a headphone jack

I upgraded from a walkie-talkie to an iPhone 11. The changes were mind boggling.Actually no, I&#39;m kinda broke.

The s10e us a much better phone for even less

Hi i hope u can help me have a gadget for my online class😔

I was recommended to <b>cybernet_hacker</b> on Instagram by my coworkers after explaining to her what I’m passing through with my boyfriend in our relationship.things were not fine so I had no choice than to figure what’s wrong by hacking his iCloud,iMessage and Snapchat to monitor him without notification

&quot;So what new about the iPhone 11? Well first of all the name&quot; That crack me up .😂😂😂

Lol I just got the 11 today. Haven’t used it yet because I’m still setting it up and everything but fingers crossed it’s worth it! I upgraded from the 7 lol

I went from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 11 big change

I have an iPhone and I keep getting very disturbing international phone calls on a daily basis. When I block one number, I get another phone call from a different number and it never ends. Is there something I can do to block all international phone calls?  or block certain countries?

Y’all are lucky I want the iPhone 11 but my mom said she doesn’t have The money 🥺😒 so I can’t get it and I really want it bad

<a href="">7:45</a> that didn&#39;t age well

I&#39;m between green and red. I don&#39;t know which one choose :&#39;)

I went from the underground dungeon in my neighbors backyard after being trapped for 33 years to an iPhone 11. Eh it’s alright.

Just coming from a 7 Plus, definitely worth it.

Hmm, still waiting for the 2020 iPhone with the notchless display? :P

Where’s my iPhone 7 gang at
Getting this when I move house hope it&#39;s good

Ammi is speaking but Abba is not saying anything...I am in India❤️❤
Its funny how your doing a iPhone 11 review and it says made 11 months ago

I bought the iPhone XR last summer not because I wanted to but because I had to. I was amazed that a budget iPhone could have such amazing cameras and a battery that I don&#39;t have to charge every night. Hopefully Apple will keep the iPhone 11 around when they release the 2020 iPhones because it is that friggin good!

I have the green 🥰

When will the iPhone 11 price drop again asking because should I get the XR right now or wait for the iPhone 11 price to drop ?
