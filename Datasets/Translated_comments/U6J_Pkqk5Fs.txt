Athiya acted better than other nepo kids. She must work more on acting well and choosing good scripts.

The movie is Lovely. Athiya has sctred really well

This is one of my favourite movies. No matter how many times I watch it. I still laugh and enjoy it all the way..

Worst movie

Please tell me about any movie too😅
Full entertainment... 🥰😍
One of the finest society in india particular mp peoples and culture

Athiya&#39;s acting was AMAAZIIINGGG!!👏👏👏👏better than other top actresses right now

Where the hell is suraj

भुर्ज खलीफा
The best scene of the film is that the mother-in-law is teaching the daughter-in-law, but Nawazuddin Siddiqui is taking the sun.
Nice

Hhahah

Off stream movies are too good.  Love this love everyone’s acting in this movie.  Every single artist is epic 😂😂😂 congratulations to all actors.

Very nice movie 🍿
Her best dialogue was... Mausi tum badi kutti cheez ho ❤️❤️۞
Best movie ever... I watch this movie over 50 times ❤️❤️

A beautiful movie.

Excellent movie
You think about burj khalifa, your feeling that you will die was damn good dialogue in me as blast 😙😙🤣🤣
Everything was fine but I didn't like the word Body.
Who is coming after Kapil Sharma show

Burj Khalifa ko yaad karo feeling ajaigi 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nepotism at best.......pairing the best with the absolute worst.......

Athiya Shetty is too good!! So impressed with her acting skills. I’d say she is the best among all the newbie star kids. I especially came out to check the trailer to see the youtube comments and it is amazing how people are appreciating her acting skills!!!!!

Movie bohothi acchi he athis acting was much better

I really want to someone approach Athiya for movies she is really good in acting ek chance milna chahiye 😍

This movie is so funny I die laughing. All the acting was so good.

Athiyas acting awesome...nice family drama

Nice family drama...

i have watching this trailer only for one dialogue tum tu bitch hona babbyy 😂👌❣️

Really fantastic movie hai yr... Bohat maza aaya

Athiya shetty’s acting is awesome. She is so underrated

Good movie. Well done.
please upload it soon
Nawaz legend  ke sath movie banae ke bad fir bhi apki film flop hoti hei then u dont deserve  active

Loved this movie.watched 5 times haha

I am surprise that didn&#39;t enought successfull . This is an amazing movie and so talentous actors.  Indeed , I have not seen a movie since 2007 Rab di jodi . Right now, Bollywood  only show pretty face but zero actoral skills.  Maybe, these artists are too good to be part in the actual superficial Bollywood.

Am I a Doug? 🤣
Fan of athiya since hero movie ☺️

Athiya's acting ❤️
Namasthe Everyone , This is the movie should watched by Families , Excellent acting by Nawazuddin Siddiqui &amp; Athiya , Pure of Love of famlies. I really enjoyed laughing every moments.   This is Best HINDI movie ever with love expression.   Good Job Director , Special Thanks to my Hero Nawazuddin Siddiqui, My FAV Bollywood HERO.

Athiya is so superb in this ❤️

Mausi is in love with 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am I dooog 🤣🤣🤣 Athiya 😍
It's first love with Tameez😀😀😀
Best movie loved it.🔥

Athiya's hair will be cut by boys so that the poor girl will be in trouble.
Athiya is not fond of acting. Only Nawaz Bhai is there in the film, that's why there is a film.
Nawazuddin, his eyes ,voice and performance !! he is juste inmensely cute !!

Amazing Super Fantastic Mega Hit
Athiya looks pretty

Sindur  khela

Athiya❤🤗
I’m a great fan of nawazuddin. This movie though...to be honest wasn’t my favourite. I think it was the female character (not the actor herself) that kinda ticked me off. Ugh... 6/10

Athiya shetty best 💯👍
King of acting and among all actors Nawazuddin siddiqui

Athiya is beautiful.?.Her acting is  also nice!

This movie is really very entertaining...

Love!

Ek no. Picture name😂🤣🤣
Congratulations for 1 year of Motichoor Chaknachoor

I just thought of Burj Khalifa with a few bands...lol
Kis city me ka language hai ye???Koi bata sakta hai?

The way she says AM I DOG 🤣

It&#39;s a good movie,  I don&#39;t know why it was a flop. The only thing I don&#39;t agree with is when the fat girl is called hathi ka bacha. That is so offensive

Nice movie

Liked for nawaz sir only ❤️❤️

Burj khalifa ke bare mein socho..... People might be thinking anything else... 🤣🤣🤣🤣

What about Nawaz's acting?
Athiya did well(<a href="">0:32</a>)We are not against nepotism but we are agianst the unfair as Athiya did well the movie got appreciatation this is what we are trying to tell so long...

Like gaitonde
Athiya getting sharp day by day.

Hate Athiya Shetty 😝😵🤮🤮🤮🤮.... only Nawaz&#39;s acting attracted me here.....✌️🙏👍👍💖💖💖
Athiya seems to be learning her craft well but without sounding vain and discriminatory I have a feeling that she won&#39;t make it far as a lead actress because of her, let&#39;s say unconventional, looks. The industry, unfortunately, is quite shallow as far as women&#39;s looks are concerned and usually does not welcome any change there.

Where is this language spoken??In which area of ​​India???
Nawazuddin Siddiqui!!Athiya also improved in acting.I will watch the movie.

This movie is very entertaining and it is full entertainment.
This movie has made my sunday perfect ! Mammi ke saath mil kr dekhi...maza aa gaya.. Without a second thought watch this film guys!

Awesome movie....nawaz&#39;s acting superb n remaining cast awesome too....loved the movie. And the accent and dialogues....vry well written...just watched on Netflix

Seriously this movie is too good.

So the husband slaps the wife and she still goes back to him? Nice movie, we definitely need to go backwards and forget all about equality and women empowerment.

Athya should do these roles. Or else if she signs bs like SOTY 3 then she’s doomed.

Freaking Bollywood trailer lmao. 2 minutes trailer told the whole story. Why would everyone still be interested to watch this.

ੇਸਸਸਸਸਸ਼ਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸਸ਼ਸਸਸਸਸਸਸ਼ਸਸਸਸ਼ਨਨ
Mera naam kiya kiya hai isme
Athiya's acting will also improve by working with actors like (Nawazuddin).
Which songs are these which have been disliked till 12k. Nawazuddin sir you are a real actor 🌹🌹🌹
Athiya shetty Rockzz

Athiya mam appke aur kaise movie ayye gaye kya nawaz sir ke saath
Brilliant.
Worng heroine toh flop he hogana

Nawaz is finally getting the opportunity he deserves by good story films. Gone are the days of stupid and story less films of Sharukh, Aamir and Akshay.

Athiya shetty&#39;s acting is full on point, much good then other celeb kids who can&#39;t act but come to Bollywood .everyone in this movie is great on acting ,even the little kid acts well ,watched it today and really enjoyed it , light comedy *

must watch movie . I&#39;m from Bangladesh

Wtf advertising

How many likes for athiya&#39;s improvement 👍

1 no hai yrr movie 😂😂full comedy and nawaz  bhai acting 👌👌👌😍😍
Nawaz bhai 👍👍👍💥🔥 very bad
This is Jabran's heroin. This is where the heroin comes from.
Super b yaar
movie was vera level😃😃😃

Are you, close your eyes and think about Burjkhalifa, felling your own ways.
Suggest this type of similar movie

Nice movie...I&#39;m cried..lastly

Watched today.. Amazing acting and really good movie

This movie is a must for comedy lovers🙌🙌

Dowry and physical abuse are sins!! Crime!Such a cute movie with wonderful message I loved watching it ❤️ why movies like this don’t make 100cr? Well done Athiya

This movie is amazing I have seen this

Love love love the movie great job

I have fallen in love with you this time with great respect.
Gaitonde Bhai in Marriage Crisis.
Athiya&#39;s Acting- on word <b>Wow</b>  and Amazing movie overall!

kon kon recommend karta hay ke yeh movie main dekhoon in 2020 ? i rarely watch bollywood movies

best movie it is...

best movie.....

it has been so long since i&#39;ve seen a great bollywood movie, loved it!

Close your eyes and think about burj khalifa😂😂😂😂

What a bad trailer. Whole movie is here. What the f .

Wow

Nice work.
Karuna pandey as Mausi ji... Was. Brilliant... The way she executed the task... Speechless...She was one of the best character of the movie...

Very cute film, just watched it on Netflix. Sad to hear though that the director says her actual cut didn&#39;t make the film, that producers cut it up even more or something? :/ Would love to know what was taken out!

Can you anyone please tell me the language belong to which area?

Awesome movie. Acting, story, music, script are awesome.

So cool 😀👍👍👍👍❤
The best part i like about this movie is Athiya shetty performance....Not only Athiya is glamours but she got amazing acting skills ,. I would love to watch her as an actress in future Bollywood movies too....I hate Kirti senon,jacline,shradha kapoor,jahnavi kapoor,anushka,ileana d&#39;cruz...

Very entertaining movie. Story is just awesome and Acting is perfect. Concept of the movie is also very good.

Devanshi serial kusum sundari
Star kid don&#39;t give such movies....keep it up 👍👍
Singaram!!!
Athiya is a fucking unimaginable discovery. First few scenes you look at her and smell nepotism but as the movie progresses further this girl just blows ur mind. U remember Dhadak whennJahnavi struggles to get the accent. After 2 scenes she just becomes Ani and u forget this is Shettys daughter.

What a movie yaar.... 100 out of 100...superb movie of 2019...

How much hot movie do you make? <a href="">2:12</a> Pura barbad kardiya mera
Do your eyes on Burj Khalifa, you will feel proud of yourself🤣🤣
OMG 24million I think only for Nawaz uddin

Athiya&#39;s acting has improved. Hope we can see more of her acting in the future.

Atiya looks like a man 😂😂
The only reason why Athiya Shetty became an actress is that unique &#39;Shetty&#39; I think. I mean, how can she be an actress out of 1000 talented actresses giving auditions in Mumbai? This can&#39;t be anything other that Nepotism.

Its a simple and realistic movie😍athiya acted really well...

Supurp movie... Watching from Nepal 🇳🇵 🇳🇵 🇳🇵
Shit I, I can’t stand this actress.... sorry Nawaz bhai yeh movie fudu hai

superb

Movie ki name?
best dadi dailog.morri is the best...🤪🤪🤪
The level of Nawaz bhai who works every moment automatically rises, whether it is SRK or Salman Khan.
Bohot fadu movie hai yaar ✌️Nawaz hiding behind Athiya when they marry and come home was really hillarious. I was literally rolling on the floor laughing 😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌Athiya is superb wow just mind-blowing 😘😘😘😘

Would anyone actually talk about the movie..?

Muvi uplod karo hd m
What a movie 👌

Best movie

What a actor...  Specially nawab mind blowing

Fantastic movie

Athiya is awesome 😁😁 better than shradha

The movie was awesome. Please watch it, its a rom com in a small town setting and minus any glamour. Acting from everyone was top notch 5/5

Nice movie with nice story and comedy

Who has seen the movie?
<b>Tbh surprised by Athiya&#39;s amazing acting in Motichoor Chaknachoor! Wonderful coordination with the legend Nawazuddin ♥️👏</b>

Great movie pesa wasool

Nawab bhai awesome ...

excellent comedy.. i just finished watching it. and hats off to all actors, specially athiya.. great humour and excellent acting.

After seeing this full movie i come for trailer 😂😂😂😂

Nawajudin Siddique, my favorite actor, is giving life to the movie, these are the very few movies that you can watch while sitting with your family.
nice trailer

Worst movie of the year

Just watched ,a great performance by miss shetty,,, great comedy movie...😍😍😍

Every NRI can relate this 😂😂

Very nice movie.. people you should watch this amazing movie... nawazudin and athiya shetty did very well.. ❤❤❤❤.. Love from Mauritius 🥰🥰❤❤❤

Nawaz ka Burj Khalifa😂😆😂😆😂
The trailer of this movie is better than Street Dancer...😄
Movie was going until a scene came for body shaming. Nawazuddins brother in the movie body shames a lady they go to see and scene goes where nawazuddin gets angry on his brother. I thought he is going to defend the girl but he doesn&#39;t. Not cool.

Forced myself to watch this shit. No offence but athiya has manly facial features. Storyline is the same repeated BS from a under budget director/writer. Rubbish

Folded or folded, cut the lace. Have you enjoyed using sharp scissors?
This movie deserve more and more what it got.. Such a lovely movie and athiya u surprised us.. Nawaz u beauty..  Just loved loved loved loved loved the movie

This is movie was so funny

Feel free to feel good about Burj Khalifa!
Acting on point but story is shittt. 🤯

<b>Who r watching 2020</b>🖥🖥🖥🖥🖥🖥
Aathiya 😍😍
Omg Athiya is really surprising😎

It&#39;s on netflix for anyone who has a sub.

<a href="">1:48</a> hahahah What a Advice !! Burj Khalifa :D :D

Amazing movie..

NYC movie 😂😂😂😂
Dhsssssu trailer hai yrt
Who is here after movie... Now such movies needs support in cinema... Love from Pakistan 💓

Just watched this movie on Netflix. The critics who gave it bad reviews must be out of their mind or have really low IQ. It is a BRILLIANT movie with not a dull moment, original story, massively entertaining and Nawaz is excellent as always but Athiya...OMG ..she steals the show. She is a veteran masquerading as a newcomer. I hope and  pray she makes it BIG!

Lets give credit where its due.Athiya shetty - Yes i agree with everybody, her acting skills have shined in here.Nawazuddin - This man is probably Top 5 Actors in whole Bollywood. And thats real big.Now all the supporting actors are not getting credits so let me explain.All of the supporting roles were played very natural and no over acting at all. Athiya mom is so cute. The innocent mom type.Both of their father roles were played very natural and good as well.Highlight of the supporting role was athiya&#39;s aunty role.(Not only she is a cute aunty which is a bonus, she is so funny in the movie and her acting was beautifully played in her character.All the supporting characters really lifted the film up. I dont know how this movie havent become blockbuster hit. So many crappy movies were showned recently including, houseful 4, war and so on.

excellent movie. Athya shetty and nawaz sir acting is too good

This film flopped I couldn&#39;t believe

She is talller like coconut tree infront of him

Burj Khalifa is the largest building in the world and it is in United Arab Emirates, Dubai

Must watch this movie.

Gajab ki moovi h bhai maine to dekh liya I m happy 😘😘😘

The best film of 2019 and the only film that I saw, no vulgarity of any kind, unique acting and melodious music, transition from comedy to makeup, a simple family and a unique love story. The simplicity of this film puts it in a different category of film.
Burj khalifa🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol.. if the following comments are taken into consideration, i must say people are appreciating her acting skills only after seeing her in a typical desi character 😂

Liked only for Nawaj sir 😅
Nawaj bhaii...back..😘😘

Mst h teaser

Film was brilliant really leaving you with a smile and heart warming feel. I dont know why it wasnt a success??🤔

KGF part to fans hit like

Athiya Shetty is a good actor from her very first film. I wonder why people are commenting that she has improved or done a great job here. She was already mind blowing.

This movie is not available online anywhere😭😭😭😭
I think about you with my band and Burj Khalifa...Feelings you will see for yourself..

Nawaz bhaiii ke real fans hit like ❤🙏
Lovely movie

Maddchod ne movie to bana dii lekin movie gand me release ki

From what angle Athiya looks like an actress? Only because of sunil shetty she is in bollywood otherwise she cant act.

Athiya got better
Haha wow trailer say tou bohat mazedar lag rahi hai movie!

Nawazuddin Siddiqui &amp; Kajol ❤
This movie is the &#39;Surprise Package&#39; of Bollywood this year. The Accent &amp; Dialogues are good and both Nawaz Sir &amp; Athiya impressed on-screen with their acting. The Bundeli Language is tough to master but both of them did a very good job.RegardsAkash

Kabhi khabhi apu ko iyj lagta he ki sala apun is bhagvan he Jisne  ye dialog dekha he Vo like kare ✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔

Atiya is so talented,award winning performance hai, nawaz is good as always.

The new actress has a bright future is very impressive... She has the acting skills not dumb like Sonam Kapoor.

This trailer 👍🏻better then, the trailer of Pagalpanti👎🏻 is selling very well 😬😬

Bad marketing made this movie a huge disaster

Burjkhalifa..lmao

Much better than pagalpanti hu😇😇 ,nawaz looks father of atiya,height bhi tho 😋😆

nawazuddin
Nawazz bhai 🔥🔥🔥
Athiya is so underrated 🙄❤️
Nowadays the expectations of girls have increased so much...even if they themselves are unemployed...and if the boy is unemployed then it is not a big sin for him...the world is not using him. seen through the eyes of a code
nawaz bhai toh hai gaye hai
Brother, may your life be long 🙏🙏🙏
Since you have found a mod, you are also running on it.
An awesome movie must watch

I like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and seems like a fun movie BUT the fat-shaming in this trailer was NOT proper

Athiya Shetty acting is super in this movie.

Athiya is surprise package

Making👇👇👇
Nice promo

Nice

Love to be in Dubai!!

Wow superb
Super trailer
Nawaz bhai is acting in a number...💓😀✅
Debamitra... Direction...Nice....
For this kind of movie.... Ayushman Khurana is the best

Nawazuddin sir always come with something different and nailed it👌

Looks interesting we wish whole tram good luck

The movie is going to be a Hit !

Bakwaas, Sunil Shetty ki chori ka career upar le jaane ke liye banaya hai movie by using Nawazuddin. Nawazuddin should stop helping start kids to build their career.

Athiya will going to play a unique character through this movie.. I think this will be nice

Nepotism Rocks

The first love has come from the mind
Going to Dubai, going to Satguru.
90%coment athiya acting best performance than famous over actress

1000 times better than dabang 3 trailer

Shoot In Bhopal My City....🥰😍
Nawaz Sir Ka Asar Hogata Hai Acting Todi Achi Kar Rahi Hai Atiya ???😇😃➡️
feel like athiya is similar to kriti sanon

Selection of actress is wrong..

She Talks like nimki mukhiya

Nawaz bhai 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
2.13 Isme bhi Gangstar nawaz Ka asli rup Bahar ahi Gaya by the way film will be great

Nawaz is full of blissfulness and on the other hand we have the curst dynast of sunil shetty family. What an unique combination. I would like to ask the viewers that one thing they must ask to themselves that do athiya shetty even look like as a female actress...This what the coming Bollywood full of dynasts and very less respect and demand of shear talent . Even sunil shetty on the first eye can&#39;t even deny the fact that his girl not even looks like a female.Things are getting changed....in Bollywood. Time of amitabh and those legends is going to end or we can say its end even happened but we are not conscious about it.These guys don&#39;t even know what is the real meaning or role of cinema.

Bollywood mein sabse alag blockbuster acting hai namaj bhai ki my favorite hero ek number acting love you bhai 👍👍
Hit like for #_nawaj sir

Woooow nawaz and athyia just rocked

&quot;Am i dog&quot; this line😅😅

Burj khalifa🤣🤣🤣
Hi

Can’t wait to watch this movie

Close your eyes and think about Burj Khalifa🤣🤣🤣

My Favorites acter

Nawaz bhai... Great
Waiting
Athiya shetty is not look like a heroine.. When Rani mukharjee, preeti jinta, kajol , Aishariya, Tabu, Sonali all are  retired.. The whole Bollywood industry destroyed

Nawaziddun bhai, you make Sacred Game.. you will ruin your life by making such stupid movies..
Think about Burj Khalifa
Agar Koi Doubt Hai To Mat Par Trailer Nawaz Bhai Ki Movie Achi Or Hit Na Ho Ye To Ho Nhi Sakta!!
After the Kapil Sharma show,Atiya is on fire 🔥🇳🇵

Phle app
Gotta watch this movie to see the end as it  almost seems like my real life story.

Hit like for athiya 😄😄😄
Athiya Shetty&#39;s acting seems to be really awesome. Hopefully, she will prove herself in this movie.Hit like 👍 for her.

Wow athiya&#39;s acting is also just awesome

Going to be hit atleat if not a super hit. But i want it to be superhit. Athiya has worked hard and it is showing on screen. Jst a bit of facial expression wjich definetly will improve. Nawaz ji has trained her perfectly. Very good acting and chemistry by both.looks funny story too. Movie will do well atleast a hit. Can be a truning point  in Athia&#39; s career.

&quot;Tum aakh bandh karo aur Burj khalifa ki barein mai socho, fillings apni aap a jayae gi........... &quot;    comment of the trailar

Only nawazuddin bhai k liye

Nawaz bhai yeh aap kis line me aa gaye...

Nawaz suits only in negative roles

Nawajuddin Siddiqui is the natural Actor proud of you sir

Heroin tatty h bc
Happy hearing my country name &quot;Bhutan &quot; in this movie

Didn't get any movie of Bhosri, he was watching a Ghatiya movie.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui is one of the most underrated actor ........

Nice to live!!!!
What a great JODHI, Nawaz in Love Story! what a great Combination.

Review is needed
Nawazuddin Siddiqui&#39;s acting is the best mind blowing very talented and natural actor.

Nawaz Sir will be as usual fun to watch but real suprise is Athiya Shetty here. She looks really promising here. Hope this film marks as an turning point in her career and she does better films with good acting. Looking forward to this film 👍

Burj kalifa socho
Think about Burj Khalifa.
My favourite athiya shetty

Mst

I am Waiting.......😍😍😍😍😍
Akh band karke burj khalifa ke baremain socho feeling apne ap aa jaygi...... love this one.... fav dialogue

Osm trailer  very excited 😍😍😍😍😍
Which ended with the shower of slippers, Nawaz Bhai... I am happy... :-)
So glad that even though athiya wasn&#39;t seen in movies but she made the right choice, by selecting this promising content and not doing commercial movies where she might have lost her potential as an actor

Burj Khalifa
<a href="">0:45</a> Am I dog..lol

Everyone&#39;s a good actor until he signs for Karan Johar&#39;s movies ❗❕😥

Athiya is still acting that
Nawaz Bhai's angry part is more interesting 🙏🤣
Athiya shetty voice sounds like Deepika  Padukone.

What kind of movie is this man?
Nwazoddin bhai ur great
Sunny Paaji's pussy was better than Athiya, it is absolutely useless, great waste.
Seems much better story &amp; acting then Senseless Housefull 4 Movie.

Before taking name of Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka teraa thopdaa thik karalee Shetty ghodi!!

I am saying that I will fall in love with Aathiya Shetty after watching this movie. She is looking So impressive and different .

Awesome 👍 chemistry
Is this the year for Bihari/Bhojpuri middle class movies?

Owsome

Useless, Foolish movies. No value-added to society.  Producers need to make money so throw any crap.  No A-lister will do this kind of crap roles so they find people like Shetty. God knows if his father is sponsoring her for this.  waste of time.

Abe Nawaz gaytonde bhav nahi feeling nawaz ka burj khalifa hi ki burj khalifa hi suffi hai.
Really proud to see Athiya Shetty in this role... keep up girl...

Wow what a trailer 🙏🏻
Pushpendra Tyagi 💪💪
Lets show the real power of public and make it a sleeper hit. Cmon India.

Well done Athiya...
Tum toh bitch hona baby...OMG! I died laughing watching this.

It sounds gud ! Is it a song from the movie or only background score?  Music which is being played since beginning.

What&#39;s with her makeup?

Nice movie super
Nice Trailer. Great Acting by Nawaz &amp; Athiya.This movie collection will be sabotaged as Marjaavan is releasing on the  same day.Athiya&#39;s acting has improved &amp; has worked hard &amp; the result shows.

She seems to be good in acting in this movie

Best wishes athiya

This should have been Athiya&#39;s debut movie. Acting chops are showing after 4 freaking years and it&#39;s so great.

If you find a mudi, you will also run away.

Hahahahaha love you nawaz bhai
T series 😂

Grapes in the water of Langoor
Superb movie.

Super Is
Finally a movie on a real life concept of &quot;gold digger&quot; girls..

YET ANOTHER MOVIE WRONGLY PRAISING, LAUDING AND APPRECIATING THE ACTUAL EVIL GOLD-LICKING FEMALES, WHO DON&#39;T HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO, EVEN IF THEY ARE WILLINGLY LEAVING THEIR HOMES AND MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE, THEY MAY/MAY NOT KNOW... I HAVE SEEN MANY EVIL, GREEDY, SELFISH, SELF-CENTERED FEMALES WHO MAKE SUCH HIDEOUS, OUT-OF-RIGHTS, IMMATURED, GREEDY, SELFISH DEMANDS LIKE THEY WANT AN NRI-HUSBAND, OR WANT THEIR HUSBAND TO TAKE THEM ABROAD...THIS IS A SHITTY, UNALLOWABLE MINDSET, WHICH BOLLYWOOD SHOULD RESPONSIBLY AND DUTIFULLY RECOGNIZE AND ATTEMPT TO MAKE MOVIES WITH STORIES THAT TAUNTFULLY AND ENFORCIBLY ERADICATE AND OBSOLETE SUCH SHITTY &amp; VILE MINDSETS AND NOTIONS FROM OUR SOCIETIES. MINDSETS LIKE &quot;NO ONE LIKE BALD MAN&quot;(BALA), &quot;A BALD MAN CANNOT GET MARRIED&quot;(UJDA CHAMAN) AND THIS MOVIE - &quot;IF A MAN IS NOT GETTING MARRIED, THERE&#39;S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM...&quot;, THE FACT IS IF ANY MAN(WITH OR WITHOUT ANY APPARENT BODY ISSUES/DISORDERS) IS NOT GETTING MARRIED, IT&#39;S ALL THE FEMALES&#39;S FAULTS, BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE NOT MATURED, SELFLESS, HUMANE, NON-GREEDY, RESPECTABLE ENOUGH TO SEE THRO&#39; THE OUTER APPEARANCE(i.e. IGNORE THE OUTER LOOK) INTO THE INNER UNDERSTANDING, CHARACTER AND SOUL OF THE MAN, WHICH THEY ARE BOUND TO LEARN AT THE NECESSARY POINT BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW OUTERLY &quot;SO-CALLED&quot; BEAUTIFUL THEY&#39;RE, THAT NEVER COUNTS, ONLY INNER CHARACTER AND NATURE IS CONSIDERED WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MARRY AND SPEND THEIR REST OF THE LIVES WITH THEM....
It was fun.
Awesome 😂

Acha hai
Film ke writer ko salam kya kya soch soch ke kahani itne achche lekhte ho movie trailer bahot mazedar dekhrahe hai .movie toh ek dum hit hoge .all the best 👍🤗

Hi guys plz subscribe to our channel. Our team is working very hard.

Athiya&#39;s acting on point !!! What an improvement . More power to you girl ❤️

Her voice is dubbed
Awesome trailer.

Think about BurjKhalifa, you will feel like you will be happy.
What a good thing Nawaz Bhai.
Athiya acting improved with Nawaz presence <b>Sangat ka asar</b>  ☺️

Athia shethy looks like a prerna from kzki

He has fallen in love with great respect
The hight difference 😭

Athiya 🙏🏻
love the trailer!

The similarity between the character shown and a tyagi is same as showing Rajesh Bhatia(a punjabi ) as Bangladeshi fisherman. Not authentic at all. Movie banane ka paisa h to mtlb kuch bhi dikha do.

Burj khalifa k bare main think 🤣🤣🤣
So story about a  Gold digger bi★ch

How come this girl became actress?!!!

Better than bala

Nawazuddin..how is he a hero..is he good to...Rampal Yadav shows...some too..make people happy by making stories..that's it...you know how to make people of father's age heroes. ..or .. even a hero of 52 looks like 25, he looks like a hero of 60..
Athiya shetty killed it

Wow what a movie.
&quot;Tum to Bitch ho nah Baby&quot; epic line ever.

Athiyas is Sonam Kapoors replacement

Athiyas acting is awesome ..she will do better if she get few more opportunities

Where is the line!?
That&#39;s what happens when you work with talented people. Now, Athiya looks promising and Nawazuddin is still the  best!

I really wanna watch Athiya

Etni comedy... 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Pet sadness. Hey friend.
<a href="">1:47</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Burj Khalifa
only Nawaz bhai can do this amazing type

The promo itself revealing the whole story.

Blockbuster movie hai
Now what can I say about Nawaz....just do it here..&quot; Arey Bhai Bhai Bhai Bhai.....&quot;
Athiya Shetty's acting is looking very good, please stay away from Karan Johar brand.
😇 Matrichoor = Read madrcho😆
Film will be flop because marjaavaan realese on 15 november

Oh my god...too much fun
Athiya steals this one👏

All the things which I find inherently evil, all packed into one... Shame on India

through this trailer I feel that heights matters 😂🤣

Bindaas nice movie

V funny...

Agra's Brajbasha shows immense influence of Bundeli, same as Mathura's Basha was shown in Dream Girl. Yes people don't understand the difference between Braj and Bundeli.
Nawaj bhai on fire💥💥💥
Close your eyes and only think about Burj Khalifa. My God! :o @<a href="">1:48</a>

<a href="">2:12</a> gaitonde  😂🤣😂
You must go and watch these movie halls... because you will feel the need to watch Salman or SRK's movie so much so that such movies will get support... script wise, acting wise faadu 🔥
Think about Burj Khalifa with your eyes closed, mood will rise, think like 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
😂😂😂

Epic am I dog 🐶🐶
What dirty acting is Athiya doing.... This heroine is not like her friend.... Neoptism rules in India... If the mother of the movie got fucked then it must be because of this.
Skilled &amp; Tallented Actor vs Unskilled Rich Bychance Actor.  Nawaz hai to hit to hongi

Anyone from Bangladesh?
Nice

Aur hum hai gaurav tyagi

The rest of the sub is fine but backchod sari is shown in the movie trailer, we don't know what homobackchodians do.
abu😭💗💗💗💗💗
i think Athiya she&#39;s have best face for acting wooooow girl u can do it

Waooo

Oh nawaz sir your just dig it
Bhopali's ❤❤❤❤
Super.... Trailer

Super hit 👍
<a href="">1:57</a> I loved this expression of nawaaz ❤❤❤❤😍😍😍

Viacom 18 - You must put interactive &quot;THUMBNAIL&quot; for this trailer. Now a days, it matters a lot. Nothing is clearly visible not an actor and even the movie name. Both matters a lot for exciting viewers to view it.

Amazing trailer

I&#39;m really surprised 😲😲good job Athiya👍👍👍
Nawazuddin❤❤Athiya❤❤..nice trailer
Nepal,Sri lanka, bhutan hahaha Not Bangladesh ??? 😀😁😁😁😁😂
Love Athiya&#39;s acting 💜
A big suggestion to Athiya.. . Baby don&#39;t sign karan johar movie&#39;s. 😂😂😂😂😂

Cast sence of humor is serious fu**ed up.

Nice

Blockbuster movie hai
He says that he bought food in a high shop...same thing with Karan Johar...he could earn money in films but could not do acting...look at Athiya how much he has improved in acting.. Seeing the color of the food changing, the color of the food has changed.. acting with Nawajuddin definitely makes a Sikh human...!!!
@<a href="">0:48</a> ,Shouldn&#39;t we be ashamed of these dialogues in our movies ?? Wanna be cool persons are actually destroying their own dignity.

Athiya is rocking.

Athiya is back.

Look, you have found a dead person, you are also running away from him.
How good is the song in the trailer?
Ultimate trailer

Nawazuddin, look, the policeman has been beaten to death.
Jab bhi koe force accent me bolke acting karta hai to log usse achi acting samaj lete hai.look at the comment section sab bol rahe hai &quot;ahiya&#39;s acting skills are good&quot; pata nahi Bhai/Ben log aap kis scale pe acting ko measure karte ho agar ese aap good acting bolte hai. Then you have way too low understand of acting and esi wajah se yeh log picture banate rahte hai without improving and aap log bus wah wah karte rahte ho.ab dhanda chal Raha hai to chalne do.

Brother Q, you are spoiling the good carrier.
Can’t wait to watch this!!!

Woww.. . Athiya is looking so good.. .. . Her accent here is.. . 😘😘

Nawazuddin also doesn't respond, he is acting like a bastard.
<a href="">0:31</a> to <a href="">0:32</a> look at her hand 🤚🏾 rukhe baijaan se 🤣🤣🤣
Uncle banna challa jawaee abh Tara bodha ka din Aaya Ha G

<a href="">1:52</a> then i miss song to chalun to chalun form border

Nawazuddin is already a brilliant actor. Here athiya too performed great

Nawaz Bhi AAP is doing such good acting, making good movies...what a stupid thing you are making.
Nawazudin, Irfan Khan, Rajkumar rao, Ayushmaan, Vicky kaushal....all amazing actors doing  untouched subjects, way to go..

The scoundrels of Bollywood have learned from the South... Have you seen a masterclass like Jersey?? Now you guys will also copy us...
What a Actor This Man Is Another Level🔥🔥🔥🔥

Indian directors making some good movies in small budget great bhia je great love from pakistan  i still waiting for this movie

Love this trailer 😍

And athiya impressed with your acting skill

Nawaz sir yeh thik  baat nahi hai hum toh addict ho Gaye aap ke acting ke watching trailer tenth time
