Masha'Allah, may God be pleased with you and may God have mercy on you, CHARLI HEPDO and her cronies, who insulted our PROPHET, who insulted our PROPHET, who dishonored the 5 billion Muslim population for what they believed in, received the necessary punishment. It was a late action. MUSLIMS are sleeping, but whatever we are, these brothers of ours did what was necessary. Even if they are far away, our brothers with MUHAMMEDI hearts will do what is necessary for their cause BIIZNILAH ☝️🇹🇷🇹🇷
Allah-u-Ekber ☝️☝️☝️
These ones are completely off the mark 🥱 It's a foul ball, it's a foul ball, the smell isn't there... it's bouncing 😑 and the fact that the police car smashed other cars seems to shock him more

You will learn this: no one can insult the prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace be upon him). Otherwise, we will kill those pigs just like that. ALLAHUMME SALLI ALA SEYYIDINA MUHAMMADIN VE ALA ALIHI VE SAHBIHI VE SELLIM.
Muhammad is a false prophet who has brought noting but false teaching and death to the world...I give thanks that he and his followers will be buying in hell for all time

Umar ibn Dinar hat es von Hazrat Jabir ibn Abdullah erzählt; Der Gesandte Allahs sandte Muhammad ibn Muslimah, um Ka&#39;b ibn Ashraf zu töten, Ka&#39;b ibn Ashraf lobte den Gesandten Allahs und der Muslime, Er widersetzte sich dem Prophetentum.(Sahi Bukhari B4, H-Nr3811) (Shahi Muslam B3, H-Nr1801). be killed off my mind too.  the same punishment of the arrogant prophet is separated from head to body

Sooo where were the other cops? If this happened in the US, a dozen police cars would most likely arrived in a minute

God bless you
No matter what the police are always armed they were scared yeah
He&#39;s yelling,&quot;I am a pig and I will rot in hell with my other fellow pigs, I don&#39;t understand the concept of Quran and again I am a pig&quot;

stepping out of the car shooting at the police with an ak this is crazy man

Never ever joke about our prophet saw
Arab muslims are the only people that take action

Je suis Charlie

Allaho akbar

Was the guy filming laughing at the end? Wtf?

Everyone that is supporting isis in the comments, should be hanged.

Why u’r trying to provoke us. U guys know that we love our prophet (pbuh) so much. Isn’t there any other topic to talk about and to publishOtherwise we have never mention your prophet never because we know that all prophet are holy

They learned skills from CSGO

C cho les articho

These events are beyond us!
French cops ptdr 😂😂😂😂😂 cagers
Allahu Akbar SYRIA LOVE
.

You self-made retarded French people
He has one of those audacity to film...
What is he saying
I don&#39;t make fun of any religion. Cause it is disrespectful to do so.

<a href="">#OnAVengerLeProphèteMohammed</a>
<a href="">1:38</a> Janek, hide, man XD
this is more like in movies

dont make a joke with our religion symbol,we will defence to death with proudly

PUSSY PARIS POLICE!!!

The police car (out of fear or specific orders) let them go away. He could very well have left the car at the end of the road, depriving them of the possibility of passing.
"Janek, hide, man" haha
It's bad balls, it's bad balls..&quot;bang&quot; &quot;bang&quot;..Ah no, it's not fake balls.
I heard Hanys
what escapes you is that the two guys stopped with the C3 on the avenue opposite to the one you can see and where the police car ends up. Well. they mind their own business while a police car is beyond the trees
He looks really well tanned under his hood and around the neck. The build is the same too. That's probably where he lost his ID that fell out of his back pocket between two magazines.
this is a big Joke .. Empty street .. one police Car .. blackmasks and Guns in the middle of the Day ? 

How did they behave so easy and like they didn&#39;t commit crimes ? and why they needed to say we avenging prophet Muhammad? Everything thing looks suspicious and it&#39;s comedy show made by French government 

an ordinary police car against 2 crazy Islamists who shoot Kalashnikovs at them, the cops didn't expect it and must have been scared for their lives seeing how they backed away while driving into a car at the bottom of the street, it feels like GTA damn!!
HAHAHAH... cartoons
In 1999, Serbia was bombed by the NATO just because it had to fight some extreme Islamic terrorists and had to protect its borders. Serbia was demonized instead of helping this beautiful country and beautiful people. I am sad for the French who were killed but shame on NATO!

But where do the two who are filming come from!? It seems like they speak Ch'ti lol
They want to achieve their interests by putting Islam in the middle like 9/11. Je ne suis pas charlie!
C FO BALLE 

is this the police they shoot dead with a shoot to the head ?

Not All Muslims Like That... So I Am Muslim, and I am Against Terrorism.. No Racism
GtaV 

charlie hebdo=shit! :)
I do not believe that this retard is the campaign manager for Sisi, the best man in Egypt and the Arab world
The cops are dead? They just let them go. They must not give French cops guns.

What&#39;s he saying?

<a href="">0:13</a> My name is Aboul Mouara? Wasn't it the Kouachi brothers?
Another small piece, which shows what happened: the French <a href="">#police</a> did not resist the two attackers, immediately after the massacre in the editorial office of <a href="">#CharlieHebdo< /a>. The policemen in the car could block the attackers' escape, but they show no reaction. The steering wheel moves backwards and runs away in reverse. Obviously the <a href="">#assholes</a> will say that blablablabla and the blame will be on the usual <a href="">#conspiracy theorists</a> who don't accept the official version... <a href= "">#IAmNotCharlie</a> - <a href="">#Paris</a> - <a href="">#attack</a> - <a href="">#attackparis</a > - <a href="">#attackinfrance</a> - <a href="">#attackcharliehebdo</a> - <a href="">#attackfrance</a> - <a href="" >#terrorists</a> - <a href="">#terrorism</a> - *****
We can clearly see that the police are not trained for this type of situation and that’s a shame. (France does not belong to the racist so shut your big mouth)
Worst terrists ever
These are MONSTERS, not people! Sigh!
it makes you laugh you idiot
what are they saying? please.

pk the police let them escape yet they are trained for these situations
Two AK-47 and the police are helpless?

This was done by Israeli intelligence for military and political goals and to distort Islam
Harlinx Jr they seem to be delighted.
&quot;That's what France is.&quot; Is that all what inspires you about what you're filming right now? Well, damn it, big guy, go back to your country of origin and join your people if you don't like it. that you see on a daily basis and what you are filming, because this poor brainless person is one of your &quot;brothers&quot; who is killing my France.
my goodness the people who shot this are insane morons

You idiot... I hope you were able to make some money by reselling this video because your intellectual abilities aren't going to help you in life, man.
Almost a week after the attack on Charlie Hebdo by two jihadists, a new video has appeared on the Web. Unveiled by the British channel Sky News, it shows the Kouachi brothers in the street, a few moments after the massacre which cost the lives of twelve people in the premises of the satirical newspaper. We hear one of them say: “We avenged the prophet Mohamed, we killed Charlie Hebdo” then, after a few long seconds, leave in their Citroën C3. This is where they come across a police vehicle. Targeted by Kalashnikov fire, its occupants reversed into the narrow street. The video ends with new shots. The police officers escaped unscathed. On Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, a few seconds later, the Kouachi brothers came across another police officer, Ahmed Merabet, this one on a bicycle. The latter will be killed by the bullets of the two terrorists.
They are going on vacation?????? I don't believe this story.
God is great
Damn but the IQ of those filming must not exceed 50.
That&#39;s a true story of the terrorist attack of the 8th January in Paris.Not a hoax at all...

<a href="">1:38</a>  "Janek, hide yourself, man." Do I hear correctly that there are some idiots talking there?
