<a href="">3:24</a> is the worlds bs behavior lately

&quot;PewDiePie chair in rewind 2 years in a row! Let&#39;s get three!&quot; Well that definitely happened

Considering the fact that around 13-15 Billion trees are cut down each year, the fact that TeamTrees spent so much time into funding a way to plant 2 million trees is pretty useless.

poo poo in their head-HARRASEMENT!

<a href="">6:35</a> pewds just did a bit of fresh in fnf

<a href="">9:23</a> “let’s get 3” that didn’t age well

<a href="">9:24</a> little did we know
<b>the c h a i r</b>

Any anime everPewds: full metal alchemist

Pewdiepie is liberal? Sad
Pewds: &quot;Sorry I&#39;m always shoving things down your throat it won&#39;t happen all the time but poopdie is really a good game&quot;Also Pewds: &quot;Whaaaaaaaaat.... you haven&#39;t played tuber simulator?&quot;

I love how everyone just shits on YouTube now it’s so funny to see YouTube try to act like a human but everyone knows now they are robots

&quot;That&#39;s the face I say when I make L&quot;

He really just said that about my fav anime

<a href="">5:57</a> I swear everytime he sees an anime he doesnt know he asks if its full metal alchemist, he litterally did it in the last video I watched too.

Ceave Gaming be like <a href="">14:12</a>

Jack just fucked that guy up. Shit.

Let&#39;s make the shape of this poll into an F 

Pewdiepie: Lets get chair in rewind 3 times in a rowYoutube:*stops doing rewind*

Pewdipie: <a href="">9:18</a>YouTube: No

Lets get three years in a row! Here in 2020. It aint happening

<a href="">2:34</a> No, I think that’s a mask too!<b>Pulls of mask</b>It’s MatchWojo!

<a href="">7:44</a> to be fair if kids dident have phones he would probably have way less subs like if you agree

T_T

I like Kpop pewds

When you realize that PewDiePie chair won&#39;t make it into rewind for a third year

Just reminding everyone he is the guy that took a shit in a shower

Pewds: Is that full metal alchemist? People who watch mha: Never have we seen someone so high go so low.

Hypothetical, if the bro army is 9 yr olds and 19 year olds, is an 11 year old allowed to be in the bro army

At <a href="">6:30</a> he played a Dublin/Ireland song

<a href="">3:23</a> gave me a mini hart attack

Watching the old intro and crying gang

Rewatching yt rewind reactions/lwiay  coz 2020 yt rewind is cancelled

omg the old lwiay intro, feels weird now

Lwiay full form anyone?

Plip plop

my herooooooooooooooo noooooooooooooooooo how could u

When you realise Covid-19 was already spreading around the world and Pewds releases this video about being a group of morons.The irony.

Dude. What is rewind gonna be this year? are they just gonna cancel it all together

Hello

Rate the video! Write your opinion!

<a href="">17:12</a> real explanation about how pewds changes every time he grows out a beard

<a href="">5:57</a> Toga is from My hero Academia

Wtf marryweather was here hahaaahahahaa

<a href="">9:34</a> i remembered south italy and north italy from hetalia. they have a curl too haha

69 dislikes pog champ
why is merryweather here

I saw the last meme and realized I&#39;ve been playing minecraft for 10 years

a

<a href="">5:56</a> the moment my heart brokeanime: <del>obviously mha</del>pewd: full metal alchamest?

So hyped for 2020 meme review

Every anime that pewds does not know: Fullmetal alchemist

it&#39;s weird listening to the unedited version of the intro...

&quot;Thats the face that I say when I make L&quot;

I’m actually very curious how they are gonna do a YouTube rewind 2020

Im from the future and, not gonna lie, Its so refreshing to see the old intro again

I wonder what YouTube rewind 2020 will have

Felix: * mistakes Toga&#39;s anime *Me: Ight, imma head out 
Comments section is just people writing memes..

He said kids don&#39;t deserve phones but most of his fans are 9 year olds watching his vidstrkm phones

Pewds: <a href="">5:57</a>Me a fan: umm... Excuse me, what did you say?

<a href="">5:56</a> does pewds not know what my hero is?

<a href="">11:30</a> which video is this?

So.. you’re telling me, that Swedes have car gummies and Americans have Swedish fish?

i felt sad when it went from 9 to 19 because I was nine for the 9 yr old army but now for the 19 yr olds I&#39;m 11.

i cant think of anything else to watch except PewDiePie if you haven&#39;t sub DO IT!or PewDiePie will come to your house and make meme

@sam

Pewdiepie shown between paul brothers....cancer is surrounding him

When you hit the desk, one of your buttons is loose so it shakes down and it thinks your pressing the buttonSo there must be a loose button that toggles posts or something

2020 rewind ahold just be a 10 min long pic of poop poop emojis

<a href="">7:44</a> Honestly, (With the exception of games, like it was for me when I was young), I wholeheartedly agree.

ok guys leave felix didnt know it was from mha... xD he must have know by now xD

team trees

kids dont deserve phones... Me:  its treason then

<a href="">1:05</a> If you don&#39;t feel emotional you have a heart of stone while I&#39;m drinking Blood and Wine.

Anyone notice that there&#39;s  6.9k dislikes

When you realize that PewDiePie is the same Google background is you

Flurgen smurgen
Cant wait for 2020

Its hard watching old pewdiepie vids and accidentally singing the new lwiay intro

Pewdiepie is the most hated and liked youtuber at the same time

<a href="">5:57</a> it&#39;s from my hero academia! Reeeeeeee

„Sticks and Stones may break my bones“ 

hey pewds idk what to do with the green sock I am confusionalso poopdog so cute

Rush
TOGA IS FROM FMA EVERYONE

you didnt change

Hahaha they were excited for 2020

Pewdiepie chan looks like Filo from shield hero

The jurnalist infact defend Felix, the title is misleading, and titles are made by editors...It&#39;s the same mistake that most people do, forming opinions on Pewds ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯

damn he was talking simlish

but like why is youtube rewind even a thing like why are people watching it, theyve never been  recommended to me anywhere personally also whats even the point of it,  like  SOMEBODY cares if they wanted to be in it  like it doesnt even make sense in a buisness perspective over time because theyre polarizing themselves  its like why do they keep shooting themselves in the feet if something doesnt work sometimes its better to give up on an idea than to keep holding on to it

Felix god of rhyme at <a href="">1:22</a> „I didn‘t think words could hearYou know sticks and stones Don‘t break no bones But this made a man tear“ ABBA B*tch

<a href="">17:21</a> he predicted the bald era

I miss this intro

DID U SAY FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST BRUH ITS MY HERO ACADEMIA

I just went back to dislike the video

6.9k likes nicee but not nice

The anime is my hero academia

sticks and stones may break my bones , but chains and whips excite me  .

I understand that Congratulations violated the harrassment policy, but the fact that they took out a video of the list is kinda dumb because they ignored things that violated their &quot;kid friendly&quot; policy when they have an entirely different app for &quot;kid friendly&quot; content.

<a href="">8:37</a> <b>*Angry Marzia Noises*</b>

pewds: asks for 200k likes but were definitely not geting it anywayseveryone else: are u sure about that!?!

I wonder how he had the idea for this lawiay

When I watched this it had 6.9k dislikes 6.9-.= 69

Pewds: “What anime is that from? Full Metal Alchemist?”Weebs: He has cross over into the bad lands

the banana is clearly a money laundering scheme

I disagree that we will be roped in with the idiots in the future, thanks to our documentation of people criticising their bullshit. History won&#39;t repeat itself. If anything it will make the idiots look worse when there are people going against them.

I can’t wait for the rewind of 2020...

<a href="">6:55</a> Not on bing!

Pewdiepie: &quot; Is it from Fullmetal alchemist?&quot;Me: &quot;Its ok now. Why? Because Im here.Me: <b>Detroit smashes Pewdiepie</b>

felix you have to just break two blocks down 2 blocks away before the water collides with lava

I got a pewdiepie as on this and thumbs it up

You summed it up perfectly at <a href="">4:00</a> Sergio

&quot;Is it FullMetal Alchemist?&quot;No, It&#39;s My Hero Academia, a great shounen anime. You should really check it out while you&#39;re on break!

really really I don’t  much.... so, I liked memes after this video,

Exactly.

Thats the face I say when I make L

<b>sees my hero academia post</b>Felix:what is this anime from?  full metal alchemist?

When pewdiepie first announced his chair, I was like &quot;nah, why would I want pewdiepie branded chair&quot;. But now the memes have made it slightly desirable even with the 399 price tag. But alas I will never have that money for such frivolous meme chair.

Not joking I miss <b>How’s goin bros my name is Pewdiepie</b>

Thank you for being you. You&#39;re a hero and I mean it. Thank you

Felix’s reaction to every anime screenshot ever is “is this full metal alchemist?”

I drew cars like that so there is nothing wrong with me

behoooooooooooooooooooold

<a href="">5:52</a> that is from My Hero Academia.

I&#39;m the comment cop

There&#39;s a lot more my hero academia comments in here then there should be lmaoLike i get it, u&#39;re offended about ur anime, but all you have to do is correct him lmao its not funny

YouTube deleted a gmail of mine I&#39;ve never used for email for &#39;grievous breach&#39; taking out 10 12+ year old YouTube Partner and Brand accounts with 4-5M views all because I hold the wrong political views and am a centrist. After a year of monetization appeal tennis they just yeeted all of them out of the blue. No word on what I did that was a breach, but I hadn&#39;t posted in ages so god knows. YouTube are evil, absolutely evil. I can&#39;t raise attention to it because my 60k Twitter account lost it&#39;s tick in 2016 and suddenly went from rapid climb and 10-20% interaction to decline and 0% interaction and became invisible in my country. I have no doubt I am one of many. I often wonder how many people tech tyrants have destroyed by now. How many have taken themselves out from the constant barrage of deplatforming and silencing and digital de-personing? I reckon the tech companies would be responsible for tens of thousands of suicides, if not hundreds of thousands, by now. Ruining so many home grown businesses, destroying so many lives, all because what? They aren&#39;t communists and they said something spicy like there are two genders?

The ferrari bilar are some good shit tho!

What&#39;s that anime from?! You&#39;ve watched fullmetal but not bhna?

Did my dumbass  just scroll on the screen like I was on redit

hmm cars
Minecraft should sponsor PewDiePie because he’s what made it popular again.

And for all those nonsense and stupid videos that this character makes, he has more than 100 million subscribers??? What barbarity... we are all crazy in this world.

In retrospect, you may be the most hated youtuber because you are the most well-known youtuber. Therefore you are more liable to have more haters than others.

Pewds at <a href="">6:30</a> giving me flashbacks to elementary school

I had the same face when pewds said the anime was Full metal alchemist and I am a My Hero Academia fan

Me i speak englais evil!
I know my comment is long, but this is so fucked up what TY is doing to Pewds. Pewds and the 19 Year Olds are so happy about The Pewds Chair making it into YTRewind for 2 years in a row, but he literally hosted/was the main part of YT Rewind 2014. And if you search - not click on, just search in YT search box -  “YouTube Rewind” all of the years come up EXCEPT for “YouTube Rewind 2014” which is the one Pewds hosted like I said! Try it, Type in “YouTube Rewind”, look at the auto complete results, and tell me if 2014 is not there or really low/last. 2014 like it is on my phone and laptop. Wtf. They’re trying to fuckin pretend like he doesn’t exist!

Pewds: “I love killing rich people!! For their loot!” Pewds as I’m killing him for his loot : <b>*surprised Pikachu face*</b>

Can we make this the most liked comment.Like Below

Love from india

Congratulations should have been in rewind because little kids don&#39;t know what rewind is. When I discovered it, I think it was 2017.. and I&#39;m 12 rn.

The anime is my hero academia which actually is a really good anime that has come out over the past years.... it has this same stereotype mc that wants to be the best in the profession that is being a hero and stumbles upon many obstacles kinda like naruto but in a different way

What&#39;s The second requiremennntttttt?????

wait.... King of Arendelle = King of YouTube = Pewdiepie...?????

I love yiay

677k likes, we’re waiting for that correction bro

Fullmetal alchemist ??!! Really ??This is very disappointing :&quot;(

Minecraft

I didn&#39;t even get rewind recommended... So I did not see it. The first thing I watch about it is this video 

&quot;fuckin' bitch&quot; top merch
MY NAME IS ..........

i paused it at <a href="">8:29</a> accidentally and sat there for a full minute assuming it was a joke or something until i realised i paused it

Omg I&#39;m finally a 19, 19 year old not a 9, 19 year old 

If i am reacting to PewDiePie right now how many reactions is it at <a href="">10:26</a> in the video?

Damn i love pewdiepie. Id probably take a bullet for him even though he doesn&#39;t know me hahaha....

I wonder if there is a corporation making a platform that will be better than youtube

I love the word Moron to describe the current political climate.

Dude people for the last time the decade doesnt end this year it ends in 2021

When is our rewind comming?

damn the song... It&#39;s sooooooooooooooooooooooooo catchy..

Love how he still has ads on his vids.YoUTubE yOu&#39;Re UgLy

<a href="">5:57</a> again?

Felix: I don&#39;t know which anime this is from, is it from fullmetal alchemist?Me: <b>Waifu time stops</b>

I love how pewds just rips on YouTube this entire video

You look better with your beard

Is he drunk?I like him.

I&#39;m just gonna go ahead and say it, I&#39;d definitely put my pp in Pewdiepie Chan.

Pewdiepie: confuses my hero academia character with a full metal alchemist character.My hero academia character: Am I a JoKe To YoU?

Can the next CEO be such a GenZ and actually watch videos on youtube and likes gaming

According to a movie called midsommar you can speak Swedish by getting high

Anime is my hero academia and that’s himogo yoga or however you spell it

I was almost mad when he called a hero aka character from fullmetal alchemist of all things... but it doesn’t matter anyway, and he is unlearned in the ways of us basement dwellers

<a href="">3:39</a> Me eating an apple in Minecraft

Pew is a republican and doesn’t even know it. Love him for that. Not like there’s much choice when dems want to silence everything and make everything pc.

<a href="">5:55</a> All the My Hero Academia nerds started crying at once

&quot;the great depression&quot; yo that hit hard XD

So... any suggestions for a new video platform where creator can actually be themselves?

Whenbthe biggest channel on the pkatform trash talks youtube.

Pewdiepie saying kids don&#39;t deserve phone is the equivalent of thanos snapping
