Great..Hope everyone will make their dream a reality...Below is my short movie link. Hope you will like it..<a href="">

You Know I Am Quite Happy About This Film&#39;s Box Office Success!!!!!!An Woman Talented Director Like Zoya Akhtar Deserved This Huge Success Because She No Doubt Has Always Choose Bold Subjects For Her Movies Which Are Quite Real In Our Indian Society!!!!!Have My Word She Will Definitely Make India Proud On Global Platforms With Her Powerful Movies!!!!!!!!!An Worst Director Like Indra Kumar Is Nothing Front Of Her For Sure!!!!!!!

Wow Truly An Entertaining &amp; Most Importantly Quite Inspiring Promo This Was!!!!!!!Seriously This One Is Million Times Better Than All Bad Promos Of Total Dhamaal!!!!!Also Kudos To Ranveer Singh For His Expressive Acting!!!!!!!For Me He Is My Current Favourite Superstar &amp; That Bitch Actor Called Ajay Devgn Is Nothing Front Of This Actor!!!!!!!!

The future of Bollywood is safe 😌
