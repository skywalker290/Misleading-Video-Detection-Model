ohh god they don&#39;t have shelter it means the forest area was decreased so this will happen

Its a baby.

What a beautiful hippo

nice video

Read the Fucking Title its NOT india

Not everyday you&#39;ll see a tiger cutting traffic

This happens bcoz we cut forest. &amp; also we kill animals for money. We need to save them. But careless villagers cut jungles &amp; waha rehene jate hai or aagar animals waha aaye to maar dete hai matlab animals ke ghar me animals nahi rehe sakte how sad

I love my india 

poor motorcyclists

The kings walk.... lol

Who let the tigers out {rawr,rawr,rawr,raaaaawr }

hope that tiger is safe.

omg

how this happen

So sick in many levels

edit

It&#39;s still not an adult tiger, completely lost on a busy road. Just imagine if a human baby of 2 years is lost on a busy highway in a completely different civilization whose rules it doesn&#39;t understand, and running here and there, completely frightened. This shows that some people get dumber as they get richer (with easy money flowing).
