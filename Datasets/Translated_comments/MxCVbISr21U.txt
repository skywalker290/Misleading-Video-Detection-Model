Angle of the sun suggests he&#39;s trying to dominate his reflection. Silly goat.

honestly looked like he was trying to hit his own reflection, especially since he 1: didn&#39;t go inside, and 2: did it twice lol

That&#39;s for charging a fortune for your work boots Colorado 

No problem door...I&#39;m here .

He&#39;s ramming his reflection.

they shouldn&#39;t have fired him:

if a person does this , they go too jail  but if a goat does it everyones like oh lol we can deal with this lol.

Outside it was very bright light, inside it was dark, thats why the goat got a good mirror image of itself in the door. The rest one could see in the movie.

Probably saw its reflection, and thought it was a rival.

Looks like a RAM raid to me. Thank you i&#39;m here all week

Goat simulator 2017

wow that Goat Simulator update is something else

Dang kids
Kids these days...

I thought this was about Tom Brady

I once lived on a very dark farm with goats. I came home late and intoxicated one dark night. I was headlight blind and trying to see my way to the house. The little goat bastard clipped me behind the knees, flipping me upside down like an NFL quarterback. The first part to make contact was my head, followed shortly by my shoulder. In the morning I went after him with a baseball bat, but as one might expect, I never got close enough to brain him. To this day, every goat I encounter knows I want to kill him.

this guy is the G.O.A.T.

Goat gangs!
Blackandwhitegoatlivesmatterps: sorry am too stupid too hashtag this )

plot twist: arabian guy teaches his dog how to steel money for him

hopefully no glass in the goats eye

I guess the goat saw some free real estate

&quot;Well, animals are a lot like people Mrs Simpson. Some of them act badly because they&#39;ve been mistreated or had a hard life. But some of them, like people, are just, well, jerks.&quot;

Hope they got goat insurance

Don&#39;t ever mess with the new don in town John Goatti!

A white girl breaking into local Starbucks.

Where&#39;s Tom Brady?

So Brian Scalbrine broke in

THE OWNER OF THE OFFICE WAS HIS WIFE'S NEIGHBOR. FUCKING REVENGE
No blood trail I hope.

You know why he did thatHe is the Greatest of All Time

Why is Lavar Ball trying to break into Argonics??

Wonder if insurance covers this.

GTA stands for Goat Theft Auto

If you&#39;ve seen the movie The Witch, this makes perfect sense

Mating season for most animals (summer). Sun is hitting the windows. Saw his own reflection thought it was another goat to fight after. lulz ensued. Moral of the story, don&#39;t polish those windows during summer.

No alarm that could&#39;ve scared the goat away?

What you see: a goat smashing a doorWhat I see: A war torn goat who is breaking down racial barriers in order to better humanity

this goat would be a good burgalar

Wanna know what&#39;s more important that having surveillance video to prove a goat broke into your office......Credit.

Usually &quot;breaking into&quot; entails actually entering the place as opposed to simply breaking windows.

What a jerk, he didn&#39;t even steal anything

Goaty MacGoatface :D

Is that Conor Mcgregor breaking in!?!??!?

At first, I thought the goat wanted to get in and when it started to break the other part of the glass door then, I realized it&#39;s a customer who had a bad experience. Management needs to address the situation. Why is the customer this mad?!

Autisum strikes back and again.

Savage goat of the century

PROBLEMATIC: Argonics has glass doors - this is a danger to goats that want to break in and risk being cut by the broken glass.  Argonics should be sued for suppressing these goats and endangering them.

The goat probably saw another goat reflected in the glass and, as it didn&#39;t back down, saw it as a challenge. Butted heads until the goat appeared in the next window then eventually went away. Goat 2 - Reflection 0

Does your insurance cover goats? 

The glass in this door is probably 2mm thick! But I didn’t break the first glass, it just fell out, because... was not secured
next to humans, i think goats are literally the dumbest animals on the planet

the fucking goat LOOKED AROUND first what the fuck

Saw itself in the reflection of the glass. Very disappointed. Thought it was breaking in to do something, but it was just going about its natural instincts.

Oh man I really want to see the face of the person who thoght they got robbed or somthing, jusy to look back at the video to see a goat. Man that would of been so funny.

Man Goat Simulator 2 has much better graphics

It&#39;s caught on camera.  The police can now create a warrant to arrest the goat and place him in a zoo.

Goat Simulator 2 looks lit.

The goat just wanted to use the printer. What is this world we live in where we shame goats for wanting to print out their college applications and work resumes?

Wait is this a publicity stunt?

Goat simulator in real life

That goat is really the G.O.A.T at break-ins(get it)

It just broke the windows it didn&#39;t &quot;break in&quot; know the difference

To anyone who thinks he is attacking his reflection: nope, they just like to tear things up and bash. I know this as I own a 200+ pound boer buck and he bashes anything that looks bashable to him, which is basically anything standing. Just look at this buck&#39;s tail wag, he knows he&#39;s being bad.

a
Goat is so savage that it breaks windows for a living, while I was shoplifting Twixes from Target at age eight.

This should be the promo for Goat Simulator 2

That goat was not fucking around he wanted revenge on those glass doors

And so it begins...

It saw it&#39;s reflection...

Goat: that&#39;ll teach him

It&#39;s that Satan goat from the vvitch

i wonder if he&#39;s considered the goat in the goat world...

That goat didn&#39;t break <b><i>INTO</i></b> anything.

lol <a href="">

once again
that is one mean goat

Goats these days have no respect. Back in my day they stayed in the farm and did what they were told.

But why?!

This goat will be the top salesman for Argoincs Inc for the month of July.

At least he didn&#39;t steal anything

&quot;Lovely office you have there.  It would be a shame if someone were to headbutt the glass out of your door wouldn&#39;t it?  You need protection.&quot;Don&#39;t mess with the goat mafia.

Someone hates his reflection

this had me laughin. Breaks both doors and dips 

Nicer than protesters these days.

r we sure this is not a Farmer&#39;s Insurance commercial?

fake

no goat simulator comments?!

Looks like the other goats forced him into doing this...

Why is Tom Brady breaking into an office

ANTIFA has got the goats breaking cis windows for them!!!! whats next?

People think he broke in on his own will, it&#39;s peer pressure guys.

<b>*sees store*</b> Manager: Like a good neighbor state farm is there State farm: Hey,  whats the problem? Manager: Yes so you see... Do you cover goat damage? State farm: Idk ask your neighbor. <b>State farm has left</b>

This goat is a GOAT

Yo, that thief is the G.O.A.T.

49-1 G.O.A.T Anyway.. this was awesome lol

In such cases the animal such as this goat probably saw its reflection and charged it. They had this problem with moose in New York city attacking bus shelters and phone booths in the park.

Didn&#39;t quite break &quot;into&quot;...  But that was one crazy ass goat.

Farmer&#39;s insurance commercial  coming soon.

<b>Tom Brady get suspended for 4 games because of breaking and entering</b>

<a href="">0:39</a> knockout blow

You guys really impressed that Brian Scalabrine broke a window 

Why is Tom Brady trying to break into their store ? ...

Why would Tom Brady do that

Why Goat? Why you so dumb? Smash head, break glass, get scared, run away, try again, break glass, get scared, run away.

He missed his barber appointment for a goatee trim.

Best part of the video is watching the other goats run away

His reflection was pissing him off. He had to stand his ground!

I may have to reconsider goat farming...

That&#39;s funny. They got thugs too

It obviously saw its reflexion and wanted to have rough sex ok? Ok.

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;d ever see Kendrick Lamar do something like this..smh

The goat is from goat simulator

When you reincarnated into a goat and you also have your job.
