Aab to politics mein aa jao..

Whatever he says about the farmers protest he speaks confidently sharing his opinion if the same question had been asked to any Nepo kids,they would walked out silently just like a dumb

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I don&#39;t know........ But with the number of double faced people I have met in life , I cannot trust that someone can do this kind of charity without any alter motive....Especially when publicity is involved......

Please don&#39;t start having soft corner for b-town celebs because of this. Sonu is like a one off good Samaritan. Bollywood is still a pit full of sewage.

Eda kalla polaya mohalale mammoooty ... Ithoke kandu padik narikale..
O great!! I guess the media being there was just coincidental... Good job good job

This is anti national activity. Go bar.

10 rickshaw deke 20 video banata hai 😂😂

If from now this man stays like forever till his last breath then no doubt I will tear my old list and make a new one on which his name will be on the top for best actors + human beings in the world for me ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ god bless his work and life

Liberandus be like - he has given them the Chinese rickshaw and we want the freedom.

Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan may have been hit with chilli.
Good music 😊&amp; good work by sonu sood

We also want to give our service to the society. I have to give alms for the underprivileged.
Every actor should be kind like him

Before entering politics..

A truly down to earth human being. He has risen as a star and inspiration in this pandemic for everyone.

It&#39;s a blessing to give also God has blessed him sufficiently

Publicity
Mrbeast - Indian version

Great person

he is a good man but not a nice man video proves it

He deserve a Nobal Prize😘😘
If whole Bollywood come together and distribute E rickshaws then definitely one day air pollution in Delhi will be maintain.

2020 = End of Bollywood anti Hinduvata era, Nepokids, Khan's etc..
Khan&#39;s, Kapoor&#39;s and nepo kid&#39;s  crying to see this man gaining following😂😂

The govt must learn from him.

My mom tells me &quot; What your right hand does should not know to the left hand &quot;

The cost of fuel per day is also quite less as compared to other fuels...Good decision of going the E-Way....

Sonu sir&#39;s Contributions  provided to the needy as much as the whole government schemes are not  being able to provide... A great philanthropists....

May god bless him

Villain in movie (reel life) Hero in real life. 🇮🇳🇮🇳
He is a good man

Delhi police constable Exam Scam by SSC.

This man deserves a Bharat Ratna

Yes this is mhasiha

God bless to hole family of this person for his generation also with lots of bless lots of love

It is better to directly help needy people than by giving to Modi government. We all should learn a lesson from this. During the lockdown, the poor did not get anything except rice, employment would make a huge difference to the poor, we got help from the pure world. But it was said that not all social works are done by the government practically. Please take time to help. The government kept all the money to save the Kursi.
Very virtuous person
He is like a God in human form...🙏

Sir salute to you

Thank god he is promoting EV&#39;s
