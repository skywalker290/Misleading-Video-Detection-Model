The reason we bombed two cities was mainly because a lot of industry was located in both, and if memory serves, Hiroshima wasn’t actually the original target but the alternative choice because of thick cloud cover that made them unable to see the target. But the main reasons were the fact that Japan had a lot of military factories in those two and I think some military installations as well. You also gotta realize that those people in those cities would’ve become combatants either way because if we didn’t drop the bomb we would’ve had to invade mainland Japan which likely would’ve pushed the war another 6 months to a year and resulted in a couple more million casualties.

90% of cursed comments suck Addhkllfdde

<a href="">9:46</a> I tried moving the cursor. I am dumb 😑

The US bombing innocent civilians is kinda expected tbh, that&#39;s what they do best.

“Dogs are dumb animals and will love you even if you’re a pos human being.” Nah, dogs are just more loving in general. Anybody who’s had both dogs and cats can tell you that dogs are waayyy smarter than cats.

Yo why was he drinkin bloody piss tho

Why can i not die

There is an easy counter to the peter pan one, the holocaust hadn&#39;t happened yet

We warned them to surrender the first time, they refused and so we did it again. Also, we were not previously involved in the war, they bombed our military bases (Pearl Harbor) and killed 1.5k people who wanted nothing to do with the world war. They also committed numerous war crimes and even the civilians were pro-war (theyre even racist today toward non-white tourists)

<a href="">2:28</a> Sounds like a quote from Good Will Hunting.

honestly those aren&#39;t cursed comments but straight up disgusting for the sake of attention 💀

They bombed them twice to prevent a full scale evasion

how does the least viewed video of pewdiepie have 8 mil views

THis is the least viewed video of PEw die Pie

<a href="">8:03</a>now I know why you went to Okinawa....

For the condom in the coffee, I once got some kid to drink a coffee that had a condom in it when I was in grade 9, we went out to this park for a sporting event and there were used condoms everywhere, someone bought a coffee but didn&#39;t like it, so I and some of my mates had the stupid idea to put a condom in the coffee and give it to some Grade 8 kid, it was so funny

Ok the japan bomb one was mainly because the us wanted to flex but also because the campaign were taking too long(and dont worry its not the worst thing that happened in asia)

I dont have a fear of spiders... i just have the greatest amount of disgust for them.Im not fearful, i want to puke on it. I dont know if thats better or worse.

I dont understand war, i am sweedish.Disappointed viking noises:

PewDiePie hearted a comment, that guy is so lucky!!!

The Japanese government was spreading lies to it&#39;s civilians about what the Americans would do once they took over an island or a city, so there were people jumping off cliffs and whatnot to avoid this supposed fate. Also, in Japanese culture, defeat in any capacity was very shameful, and losing a war for your emperor was the greatest dishonor you could achieve, so they were just not going to give up unless it was proved to them beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were going to lose. So, more people would have died if the war had continued. Also, American soldiers were being killed, so America was trying to preserve the lives of it&#39;s young men.tldr: Dropping the atomic bombs on Japan saved lives that they took.

When you see someone with their pants down like that just remind them that trend started in prison to let other prisoners know they were DTF.

The reason why they bombed Japan twice is because Japan said that they didn’t have another bomb and they will continue the war, but the main goal of the bomb was to end the war, so they nuked them twice. Tbh I have no idea why they nuked a city rather than a military base, but I guess it is to  get rid of their economic structure and then when they can completely make it into a capitalist country with ease. I may be wrong with some of my info, and also I know I’m two centuries late.

<a href="">6:10</a> he&#39;s speaking the language of Gods

<a href="">1:42</a>

Pewdiepie I agree you would’ve helped by telling that man to stop showing his ass

In ww2 it was pretty standard to bomb civilian cities You can’t blame America for doing it faster

The reason they bombed twice is because Japan didn&#39;t surrender after the first one

Nagasaki was the right path. It terrible and horrifying. And it made the world crap their pants.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki produced military equipment. They were also warned but they didn&#39;t evacuate. Don&#39;t let your simping for Japan get in the way of what they did in Nanking and Unit 731.

Of course they have huge spiders in large quantities in the UK, how do you think the ones in Australia got there. Once they got there they evolved, just backwards.

If you tierd of your life just watch these curse comments vidoes.

I&#39;m guessing you will never read this, but I thought I&#39;d let you know you are probably just not allergic to mosquitoes, so the bites don&#39;t dwell or itch and go unnoticed. Not a doctor, bit that&#39;s my guess

pewds if your pee pee is closer to the water then the spray of urine will be more powerful therefore making a louder sound so it would impress your sisters friends and the comment is factually correct

I grabbed my glass of AAM-PANA before the video started

As an American I can confirm what the crap was American thinking bombing a civilian city like bruh

I almost choked on my soup while watching this

pewds predicted everything...

<a href="">3:46</a> did not age well...

For people wondering the same thing as pewdiepie, Japan refused to surrender. It was a us or them moment.

<a href="">0:38</a>

Me who grabbed Gfuel  for this vid  Pewds - grabs your fav slurpy juice Me: The woman was too stunned to speak

<a href="">12:25</a> yes, Felix. Yes they did.. because Japan also had plans to use bombs that would spread diseases around the US killing a big portion of the population. Ofcourse this was cancelled because afew days before that America dropped the second bomb.And secondly Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two of the most military oriented city in Japan.. they were the ones with the most military bases so I don&#39;t think civilian cities is the right word.

<a href="">2:16</a> Imagine doing ur stuff and all of sudden PewDiePie drives by and Rudely compliments ur ass, and drives away casualy...

.

The two japanese cities were major naval bases just like pearl harbour, also lets not forget what the japanese did in china

<a href="">1:27</a> trying to click &quot;like&quot; :&#39; )

America bombed Japan twice because America is extremely petty

<a href="">10:03</a> peter pan took place before the holocaust-

&quot;Take off your mask, dumbass!&quot;

The Bombs were to encourage the japanese to stop the war because the japanese were ready to keep the war ongoing and more Japanese would&#39;ve died if the war went on than the two bombs. After the 2 nukes and the soviets were closing in they said screw this and gave up.

On the topic of the nuke thing, you don’t get even, you get back

<a href="">3:14</a> this joke aged verry well.

&quot;Apastroth&quot;

for anyone wondering about why the USA used the atom bomb understand that they told japan to surrender they even flew over Hiroshima and Nagasaki dropping leaflets saying to flee and leave the city. As a government official, they really had two options lead a ground assault in which thousands more American soldiers would die also with the knowledge that in japan at the time being a very fascist and militarian country would fight to the last man. The casualties on both sides would have been much higher the fault ultimately lies with Japanese officials at the time who maintained an aggressive attitude with no thought of surrendering even after the first atomic bomb.

They didn&#39;t bombard Hiroshima and Nagasaki in revenge for Pearl Harbor, they wanted to make Japan surrender, and after the first bomb Japan refused to surrender, so they launched another one. They where about to launch a third one, but Japan gave up. (Btw, the Pacific war started with the attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and finished in 1945 when Japan gave up)

<a href="">3:19</a> did not age well

<a href="">7:28</a> why do I have the feeling pewds knows more about this topic then he should.

Merry Christmas!

That....that ending man, i can&#39;t

<a href="">2:38</a> i was wheezing for 3 minutes straight

Felix, the Americans dropped atomic bombs because the Japanese were committing atrocities and weren&#39;t surrendering, to the point where they put kids to kamikaze missions. Thousands of lives were lost in the first bomb, but the Japanese still wouldn&#39;t surrender. The second bomb was necessary to win the war without millions more people dying

bros... frozen pizzas are wrapped in plastic, they may be cooked to perfection but there is a layer of melted plastic that makes them not even close

Good luck to you all

They bombed japan twice because they did not surrender after the first one. I&#39;m not saying I agree with their ways but it&#39;s just the facts.

Bruh
<a href="">1:59</a>

that white lquid from the spider isnt venom its poop

Those cities contained extremely vital military production facilities and those were vaporized so I guess it worked

”Easy access for the homies” pewds: yesterday-

Ok so Japan bombed pearl harbor to prevent America from interfering in imperial Japans expansion, dragging America into war and how dare you say &quot;tHosE wErE miLiTarY BaSes sO iTs oK&quot; unnecessary lives were lost and many of them. On the subject of nuking Japan twice, America didn&#39;t nuke Japan just because Japan &quot;bombed some boats&quot;. The war had to end, and the alternative was an invasion of the Japanese mainland, causing even greater casualties on BOTH sides. Japan didn&#39;t surrender after the first bomb, so another was dropped. Learn your history next time before ignorantly ridiculing.

Dude, why didn&#39;t you say Tiananmen Square Massacre? What are you scared of? Chinese Winnie the Pooh?

<a href="">6:10</a> that was the greatest thing I&#39;ve ever  heard in my life i dont know why

Who is mushrooms?
Peter pan actually a demon

the reason why America bombed japan was that japan viewed dying in battle to be the greatest thing a person could do so they weren&#39;t going to surrender, if you thought d-day was bad, storming Japan&#39;s beaches would have been far worse, look at Okinawa.

Pewds talking about spiders reminds me of a few weeks ago.I&#39;m British and was thinking how the UK is the least exotic place ever but you get huge spiders here. One was in the kitchen the other week and my dad got a glass. The room was poorly lit.  He went to catch it and it ran near to his foot/under his slipper.He lifted up his foot to see where it went and it had just fucking vanished...nowhere to be seen.My Dad isn&#39;t scared of spiders and I&#39;m okay with them but my mother is TERRIFIED. As we almost gave up and walked towards the front room, I had a lightbulb moment.I said to my Dad &quot;wait, don&#39;t sit next to Mum, check the spider didn&#39;t climb onto you.&quot; My Dad was like &quot;nah, that won&#39;t have happened.&quot;I put the light on and looked, it was sat on my Dad&#39;s shoulder... menacingly. So glad I thought of that because my Mum wouldn&#39;t have stopped going on about it.

they bombed the Japanese twice due to the war crimes they committed it was kind of karma for them(not enough karma for what they did but good enough)

i don&#39;t understand wars /. i am a swedish

<a href="">2:37</a> my fiance and I have gone through all of these continually since the pandemic hit

The cities had a military presence, and the Japanese basically said the we couldn’t have another on of those and said they wouldn’t surrender

I’m not defending it I think it was a terrible idea, but after the first nuke they refused to admit that there city was destroyed, so after a few days the dropped the second

I just choked at <a href="">3:48</a> still coughing

Spiderbro is awesome.

Looking at <a href="">3:13</a> today is a bit real

<a href="">12:35</a> it was to end the war quicker and to potentially save 500,000 American lives

This comment section made me realize that american history books really brainwashed their kids to the point that they think dropping 2 nuclear bombs in Japan was ok

Japan did not stop colonizing its neighbor countries before the bombing, the US has no other choice but to bomb them. It took 2 bombs for the Japanese army to finally surrender in the world war. They arent the victim, they are basically the FIRE NATION of Asia during those times. It is unfortunate for the civilians to get killed, but the Japanese were the villain in that time especially in Asia.

Pearl Harbor was a civilian area and a military base. The Japanese pretty much targeted anyone that moved and mowed down many many civilians.

<a href="">12:42</a> i know that I am being a asshole for doing this but, they needed to bomb the city&#39;s because an invasion of the Japanese homeland would have costed millions of men and supplies for both sides. And when they attacked pear harbor, they also attacked the civilian centers on the island.

The US theorized that taking the Japanese mainland would conceive multiple millions of casualties so they told Japan to surrender when they didn’t the dropped a bomb then they asked if they would surrender again they didn’t so they dropped another one, plus you know Japan ain’t surrendering any other way it’s war and that’s their art

Hey pewdiepie about the military ww2 atom bombs going off: this theroy is called total war made by shermans march to the sea during the  civil war. It makes it so the soldiers who had family there want to stop fighting and go back home and it accually saved about 2 million lives by killing 1 million you can look it up some more if you want but thats the basic facts

America didn&#39;t bomb just two cities in japan, there was several other cities bombed as well but not with atom bombs.

Wow Chris and Zach got featured

Felix talking about the use of the Atomic Bomb is honestly amazing. Can HE be the guy to run our country?

Pewdiepies next reaction should be on Japanese civilians during ww2 since he clearly doesn&#39;t understand the mindset or history

<a href="">7:00</a> wtf

<a href="">1:48</a> vagina cleans itself so it&#39;ll come out on it&#39;s own she can&#39;t keep it in 😂

Iam willing to answer pewds question about why US bombed Jpn Twice, its because Japan control almost all over the Asians land and they are very cruel, they colonize other nation with ruthless, thats why US try to stop jpn domination in Asian. fact : actually there are 3 bomb that prepared, and the last one is for Tokyo. But after 2 bomb, Jpn surrender.

Wait what do you mean you dont understand war you had one a couple years ago?

"Ant stack" = ant stack
Alrighty, there’s no chance in hell Felix will see this but to those who have the same question, the reason the USA dropped the nukes is because it was either that or a full on amphibious invasion of Japan, which would’ve been worse than the nukes, Harry Truman had no other options. Felix if you see this somehow, there’s the answer to your question.

When PewDiePie said grab your slurp juice I was drinking Milk which is my favourite juice 🤗.

<a href="">12:32</a> well the ans is simple when America first nuked hiroshima on 9 august 1947 the military didn&#39;t believed that a single bomb destroyed a whole city, they considered it a bluff and didn&#39;t surrender but when America nuked nagasaki on 11 th August japanese military realized they were overwhelmed so they surrendered. Another controversial fact is that America claims that warning posters were distributed by the airforce on the cities warning them of bombings if they didn&#39;t surrender but japanese gov says that they didn&#39;t got any warning and nuke was a surprise attack , but if america was right then the japanese dug their own graves.

I’m just sitting here thinking about what I would do if pewdiepie thought I was so annoying that he took his time to yell at me from a passing car. I would feel so stupid haha

you cant f a bike but take off the seat for the other way around

Hiroshima and Nagasaki(I don’t think I spelled them correct) where nuked because the US didn’t want to lose any other soldiers and also Nagasaki went boom because Japan refused to surrender and since the us where bombing the Japanese wooden cities so much they didn’t even realized both cities were eradicated

<a href="">3:22</a> At least this one aged well

The way he says Pearl Harbor is so funny

<a href="">5:47</a>No. I don&#39;t remember doing that. And frankly, I&#39;m concerned for you

They used 2 bombs because the Emperor did not surrender after the first, there was a several days gap in-between the bombs. Its estimated that the war would have drug on for years more and the allies might has even lost had the bombs not been used.

<a href="">12:31</a> like neptune said: &quot;It&#39;s even funnier the second time!&quot;

iS tHaT a BaD iDeA??

I don&#39;t understand war says the Swedish Viking😂

The bombing of two civilian cities was a preventative measure because of the Japanese kamikaze principle that would’ve resulted in countless sacrifices military wise if they wouldn’t be stopped

<a href="">6:15</a> thank you this tip is useful

Pewds the reason why america bombed 2 civilian cities on japan because they were helping the japan war effort idk atleast thats what i thought

They bombed it twice because after the first bomb, Japan still wouldn’t surrender

Anthill or antsack

Imagine Pewdiepie opening his car window and saying &quot;Nice ass dumbass&quot; to your face

Pewdiepie talking about the guy who couldnt pull his pants up made me think of my dad and i cant unsee it

The reason they dropped two bombs is that the emperor didn&#39;t surrender immediately after the first one. The reason the bombs were dropped at all is because there was a planned invasion of Japan, which would have killed far more people than dropping the bombs. The atom bombs were actually a way to prevent loss of life.

Can we get a spider warning?

The first nuke was necessary to prevent a quarter of a million American deaths in a mainland siege on Japan similar to D-day but like 100 times worse. It is the second nuke that is debatable whether it was necessary or not

Pretty sure it was the Japanese government not backing down after the many threats:EDIT:Don&#39;t think they backed down even after the first bomb

You asked where I would be in a nuclear fallout I would be dead I would rather be in heaven than live in a world where everything is a giant mutant.

Japan was doing some nasty torture stuff and cruel human experiments that tested the resilience of human life which would always end in death. Not justifying the bombing but war is shitty on both sides

<a href="">0:39</a> covid killed him
He and marzia were in a lada

They bombed two cities because Japan refused to believe and tell their citizens that the first one was real.

They used 2 nukes cuz the Japanese didn’t think that the first one was real

Why did you have to bring up spiders dammit

<a href="">13:33</a> Yes but actually no, there were civilians that were killed in addition to military personnel; also, the Japanese didn&#39;t yield when they were bombed the first time. Not saying it&#39;s justified, but it&#39;s like someone punching you and then you say, &quot;Bet you can&#39;t do it again!&quot;

That dream one is true for me,  except it&#39;s the opposite. For me, the nightmares START when I wake up.

it&#39;s good to see Zach and Chris pop up on here

It’s so simple. Even to this day. A military that had weaponized its soldiers. Sending people to die for “honor”. It’s disgusting how Japan treated their soldiers.Not American but no clue how Felix doesn’t just know this. America threatened to do it, Japan said “We will never surrender”, so they sent it. They then asked them to surrender again, which they replied still “we will never surrender” it was very clear that they had no plans of stopping so America made it very clear they also had no plans of stopping. Japan just got out coached lmao

The last one though 😂😂😂 &#39;Killed It&#39;

Mosquitoes like to bite martzia because her blood is actually pasta sauce.

Haha had a dream last night I buried someone in my yard was pretty happy when I woke up

They bombed the two cities as they were the centers of the Japans military. They did it twice as Japan didn&#39;t after the first bomb

<a href="">8:30</a> it&#39;s the opposite for me

jimmy= mr.beast

They did it twice because they still refused to surrender. We told them, told all the civilians there “hey, we have a weapon that’s gon whoop every single one of yall’s ass, get out of there and tell your leaders to surrender”they didn’t surrender, so we dropped the first bomb.Again, we dropped leaflets all over the city warning civilians and everyone honestly that we were going to do it again, that if they stayed, they’d die. They still didn’t surrender.So we dropped the second one. They STILL refused to surrender until we threatened to drop a third, which we didn’t even have. The bombs were the right call. They saved more lives than they took, and people were warned beforehand.

The Hook face 👁👄👁

<a href="">9:26</a> perfect r/rimjob_steve moment
The reason why you don&#39;t get bitten by mosquitos but Marzia does is because a woman&#39;s body is a little bit warmer than a man&#39;s body, so when a man and a woman are together in the same room mosquitos will be most likely to go after the woman

ik its not pronounces op a stroff but that sounds so much cooler

I know this an old video but Felix we bomb the second time bc Japan  refused to  have peace and threatened to do the same thing they did to Pearl Harbor.

<a href="">12:24</a> pewds it wasn’t just a military base. It was a place where many regular people like u and me stayed. They were killed along with the thousands of innocent men and women. In my opinion they got what they deserved. U mess with the USA u get what’s coming to u

<a href="">1:54</a> That&#39;s not even a joke thats why it started, it was so in jail people could know who was gay

Pewdiepie the us bombed them twice because the Japanese forgot literally to there last breath because it was dishonorable not to we also threatened to do it and the didn&#39;t surrender and then we the first one and they still wouldn&#39;t surrender then we bombed them a second time and the emperor or whatever it was call finally decided to surrender even though no of his advisors or warlords wanted him to.

Japan refused to surrender, thus America bombed them again.

Pog

And they told me plague doctor was a bad professionMe in 2020....

If the US did’nt bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war would probably last much longer and even more people would die, but they did’nt need to do i twice

<a href="">12:23</a> they used the bomb because an invitation will cost more lives to both sides and will take at least a year and probably way more, tike which the soviets use to gain more power.The Americans bomed Japan two times because by that time of the war, the Japanese military took over the country and refusted to surrender. A prior boming of Tokyo that didn&#39;t use nukes caused more death and damage then Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

As an American I know the reason we bombed the islands it’s because are country is fucking insane like even are generally sane people are insane at times look at cnn

The reason we bombed the city’s is because when we told Japan’s government to surrender or we would bomb they said no so we boned one and then they still insisted on saying no so we hit them again sorry but you gotta do what you gotta do.

They were not entirely civilian cities and they made strategic sense. Hiroshima was choosen for multiple reasons such as having a large military complex, important port, submarine base, 5th Division Headquarters Airport, 2nd Army General Command commanding the defense of western Japan and more. The city of Nagasaki was one of the largest seaports in southern Japan and in the form of great war importance due to its extensive industrial activity, including the production of armaments, ships, military equipment and other war materials.

<a href="">12:24</a> Let me explain Felix. Japan was the single country that was Still fighting the allies. The US and the rest of the western powers made landings after landings on the japanese islands. After Iwo Jima and Saipan (older teritories of the japanese empire) they made this big plan reaching the Japanese mainland from the southAnd the Soviet Union atacking from the north. But if that plan would have failed the loss of lives would be HUGE. But in the last minutes the president of the US, Truman find out that Scintists worked at project named A-Bomb. After some metings to force Japan surrender (and scare the Soviet Union) they dropped the nukes and the war finaly ended

<a href="">12:30</a> because all the citizens would kill themselves before they be dishonored by defeat, it would be more costly to invade than to bomb

hey pewdiepie! i named my dog awesome so i can tell people im fucking awesome!

I feel like Pewdiepie is ready to retire.He doesnt care about the rules anymore.

<a href="">5:13</a> put your volume at 100% you’ll wanna hear this

he looks like 2015 pewdiepie here

<a href="">8:45</a> but what happens if a few months later the dream becomes a reality and really your brain was just trying to warn you? 👁👄👁

<a href="">11:00</a> thats just cuz your blood type tastes gross

The alternative for the nuclear bombs in WW2 was the US attacking the main land Japan and losing thousands of men before eventually the US would defeat Japan cause even more Japanese deaths then the bombing because the Japanese believed that the most honorable thing to do is to die in battle. The atomic bombing saved more lives then it toke.

The us did it because they wanted to end the war

You are demonatised
you are a simp for listening to Marcia

Can someone tell me what bgm playing through out the video?

<a href="">12:22</a> lol i wonder if he ever figured out why. Becuz there is a reason but it wasnt becuz of just one military base gettin bomb

@Pewdiepie Unfortunately regarding the nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki you are missing something.

The world had had enough of war, except the Japanese. The Americans warned the Japanese that they would use the bomb on them, but the Japanese refused to surrender... So they did it.

Afterwards the Americans were sure the Japanese would surrender, but they didn&#39;t. Not because it wasn&#39;t devastating, but because the opinion in the Japanese leadership was

 akin to:

&quot;Bet they can&#39;t do it again&quot;... The Americans could do it again. After that they surrendered. Also, the bombs were dropped on military targets, but the area of destruction reached far.

Bruh. The mosquitoes must be a simp to Marzia 👀

i got more ads on this video than any other damn

I feel so terrible cause I laughed so much.

<a href="">12:24</a> HE REALLY LOVES JAPAN

Misquito is a simp

Pewds mosquitos need blood to have kidsSo basically the mosquitos had children with marziaR/cursed comments

They dropped two bombs because Japan didn&#39;t surrender the first time

About the Peter Pan one, didn’t Walt Disney not like the Jewish people so in this case Capitan hook saying the holocaust in this instant would have instead made Peter Pan happier instead of more upset

Mosquitoes don&#39;t like vitamin B1 weirdly. And a lot of energy drinks (like G-Fuel) contains at least the RDA of it.

The photo of the spider NOPE NOPE

In this video he jokes about pandemics. Corona virus hits.. in the next post there are jokes about a nuclear explosion. Im ready to meet my fate

i was legitimately stressed while watching this video

<a href="">1:57</a> we all have a little bit of Karen in all of us

I agree with you i got cursing comment too .. specially these people are jealous to us .. gogogogogo our friend we dont care these immature people and they dont check thier own life

Swedish boi

Pewds:&quot;The mosquitoes always go for Marzia&quot;Me: LOOK AT THOSE SIMPS

<a href="">12:30</a> The US dropped to bombs on Japan because Japan refused to surrender after the bombing of Hiroshima, and their were still many in the command structure that wanted to fight on even after that. It toom the emporer to convince them that enough was enough. The bombings did save live, the highest estimate for casaulties from both bombings was ~250,000. Estimates for operation Downfall(incasion of Japanese mainalnd)  vary widely since it never happened and every general had political motivations that colored their estimates but I think the most believable figure I&#39;ve seen is around 5-10 million Japanese civilians

<a href="">11:04</a> the mosquitoes are just simps no big deal

im sure someone has already said this but the reason they dropped 2 atom bombs is because they dropped them a week apart and it made it seem like they had a surplus of atom bombs, which was  enough intimidation at the time to stop countries from messing with america until russia made a bigger one, that is

The easy acses for the homies,one got me feeling a little way. NO HOMO

Felix is just a Japanese fan boy. That’s why he doesn’t understand.

<a href="">3:18</a> so it was Vox all along...

The USA bomb them twice because they had been fire bombing for months and the Japanese didn’t surrender if the USA would’ve invaded Japan it would’ve caused millions more lives from the allies and civilians. The USA bombed them a second time cause they didn’t surrender. And the USA president died while they where planning what to do so the Vice President took control and just decided to bomb them.

We just gonna ignore the fact that pewdiepie is talking about pants when he has no legs?

Wait if pewds had to think of what a big pp sounds like for that long does he have a small pp

My brain is launching and my body is super scared what do I do

PewDiePie: I don&#39;t understand war I am Swedish.Gustavus Adolphus : Am I a joke to you ?

That big pp water splash analogy was the most legit thing I&#39;ve heard

<a href="">11:03</a> media: confirmed pewdiepie is a robot

If anyone’s wondering, mosquitoes tend to go after the person who has the highest body temperature in the group. So if they ignore Pewds when Marzia is around, it’s probably because Marzia is <i>literally</i> hotter than him.Sincerely,A cold bitch with a hot husband, no mosquitoes for me 👊🏻

We nuked them twice because they didn’t surrender the first time we nuked them for some reason.

<a href="">10:59</a> the mosquito’s just want Martzia’s sweet marinara

Hey Pewds! Not sure if anyone has answered this yet, but here&#39;s why the U.S.A. bombed them.Hiroshima, the first nuclear bombed city, was a Japanese military and industrial city, thus being a key strategic location. The B-29 Heavy Bomber <i>Enola Gay</i> dropped the Little Boy nuclear weapon, destroying most of the city. Its destruction however, did not cause the Japanese to surrender, and thus at a later date, and after many warnings about more destruction coming, the second location was bombed.Nagasaki was not the original location for the second bomb. That title belongs to the city of Kokura. As they flew overhead however, they decided to pick a new alternative target, (Nagasaki,) because the city was covered in clouds and smoke due to a recent bombing by 224 B-29 bombers. Nagasaki was later bombed by the B-29 Heavy Bomber <i>Bockscar</i> dropped the Fat Man nuclear weapon. Japan surrendered, and the war was over.

The reason he&#39;s never bitten by mosquitoes is because Marzia is Italian I have to go through the pain of my heritage everyday. My blood must taste like garlic pasta

Australian

no! jimmy protested
Anybody else now making small pp sounds?

Hello

Kudos to the mushroom master
They take 1 we take 2

The music on the background is annoying

I don’t know why I love it so much but when you say PP and Poopoo it just melts my heart

<a href="">11:07</a> me 2 pewds like i swear to god i never had a mosquito bite this year suuuper weird

2020 now were experiencing PANDEMIC naysuuuu

Felix: I hate spiders now! Me: You used to like spiders?

They bombed Japan twice cause they didnt give up after the first one

Don&#39;t like spiders? Get a cat. They&#39;re bloodthirsty killing machines. I haven&#39;t seen a live bug inside my house in years.

Pearl Harbor was a military Harbor but they also killed many many civilians

Was there world of warcraft music in the video at some point?

Don’t forget the damn apostroff! 😂

<a href="">1:27</a> anyone see pewds go to like

<a href="">3:14</a> Vox said it

the music is so annoying

Pearl harbour is a military base but many Civilians and soldiers died. After the first nuke the general didn&#39;t surrender so the US sent another. There was no other way

The Karen 2.0 at <a href="">2:19</a>

<a href="">2:20</a> Imagine walking on the street and then Pewdiepie yells at you from his car 😂

<a href="">8:30</a> so now we DO know where he keeps the editors

There were two bombs because they didn&#39;t surrender because they couldn&#39;t believe a single bomb could destroy a whole city so they sent another one

It’s 2020, did that guy get a girlfriend?

Pewdiepie
hey

Pewds: Why did you bomb Japan? They were civilian cities?The Japanese Emperor during the Rape of Nanking: 👀 nothing to see here...

Hey, the atom bombs were an atrocity. You&#39;re right.

imagine having a great day and suddenly you hear pewdiepie yell &#39;nice ass, dumbass&#39; at you

<a href="">1:59</a> he was driving a marzia.

Pewds: why are they so many spiders in the uk Australians: 🗿

Can someone help me with the Peter Pan one? I’m confused

The Japanese wouldn&#39;t surrender and it would have cost to much to keep the war going and after the first they still wouldn&#39;t surrender.

They dropped the 2nd nuke because Japan wasn&#39;t surrendering after the 1st

Lol my comment is on top of the one that has 12k likes and a heart from pewdiepie isn&#39;t that epic gamer moment

I JUST NOTICED, FELIX IS WEARING A DANTDM HOOD

all mosquitos are simps and that’s why they didn’t go after you

America bombed Japan twice because after the first one they still didn’t agree to an unconditional surrender, so the US dropped another bomb. Japan surrendered after the second bomb.

Pewdiepie: “I’ve never been bit by bugs”Me: <b>literally can’t walk because of how swollen my ankles are from bug bites</b>

Gustav Adolf: u know Nothing about war am i a joke to u?

Wait till he finds r/noahgettheboat

Pearl harbor was a military based ambushed while we were neutral sure.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were by some accounts civilian but they still produced things necessary for the Japanese war effort, as for why did we do it twice?  We offered them surrender they said no, bomb 1.  We then offered surrender again they said no, bomb 2.  We offered surrender again they said yes.  You can debate the morality and necessity of the actions till the end of time, it happened, it worked, and a war where millions died was ended.

&quot;I was driving marzia&quot; thats wrong you can say riding actually.....

Dang that’s cursed

I’m making eye contact with him while I’m shitting stop looking at the camera

the US bombed nagasaki, and when japan still did not surrender, the bombed Hiroshima, after which the Japanese surrendered

appo stanza
I just Say pewdiepie gfuel anime....

You say “cringe” way too much

When your just walking home and your favourite YouTube yell at you <b>&quot;N I C E   A S S   D U M B A S S&quot;</b><b>confused screaming</b>

Pewdiepie: the spiders in UK  are huge and scary. Australia: hold my beer

Was that thirty virus who made the Asian hanging joke lmao

<a href="">12:22</a>the plan was force japan to surrender and when they dropped the A bomb in hiroshima they didn&#39;t surrender so they dropped another one in nagasaki

Did this video get a bunch of editing like I’m rewatching this 6 months after it was posted and it seems so much more insane than last time

<a href="">1:58</a>

I love the <a href="">6:05</a> part

<a href="">9:40</a> no, i haven&#39;t got to pretend that i&#39;m gay. i just can go there and they pass me around...

FOR LEGAL REASONS THATS A JOKE

The way he pronounced apostrophe

&quot;Thank you Sir coc.. lor... &quot;
They bombed those two cities as they had large military presence in japan

<a href="">3:21</a> no one&#39;s laughing now...

Well problem sloved than, pewds likes &quot;cream&quot; on his gfuel.

The US bombed japan first because the bomb was finally finished and they wanted to see if it works and after that they expected japan to surrender, but they didn’t so the United States dropped a bigger and better one. After that japan was all like O FUC OK I DONT WANT DIE.(I am not the best source of information tho)

Peal harbor is not a military base

<a href="">2:18</a> 😂😂😂

<a href="">12:25</a> No they don&#39;t need to bomb the cities. They could&#39;ve just invade the country. After all, it&#39;s the soldiers&#39; job to fight and die.

Imagine walking down the street and  pewdipie drives by complimenting ur ass

America dropped the bombs to apply dominance and to scare the Soviet’s

I wonder what would have happened if pewds said pull your pants up dumbass if the guy would have recognized him

The mosquito goes for marzia instead of you is theres marinara sauce in here blood

The president at the time was lied to and was told that hirishima and nagasaki where also military bases. It was&#39;nt necessary even if they were.

<a href="">1:05</a> People have been using Winnie the Pooh as a substitute/meme of Xi Jing Ping (don&#39;t know how spell in English sorry) in China so I think that is why

I sneezed at <a href="">11:34</a>

His accent sounds weird suddenly

They nuked them so they would surrender

pewdiepie hates buttcracks but he didn&#39;t realize there&#39;s like a whole episode series seasons volume Pewdie Wick 5 of his butt crack like that csgo vr vid where he wore some gay suit and his suit slide into his delicious butt crack

We sent both our bombs so we could end the war. We also sent a message to the citizens to evacuate but their government wouldnt let them leave.

Aw that last one was fked

Dat last one doe

<a href="">1:57</a> he said the &quot;yesterday&quot; exactly the same way Jacksfilms does.

Lots of spiders in the uk. Me in Australia be like:

The citys were mitlitary cities that is why they bomb them.

the reason that the U.S. droped two bomb instead of one is because japn did not surrender after the first one

r/noahgettheboat
I have that same cup....

Are we gonna talk about the bgm he uses in his cursed comments video.

Y’all, he’s still monetized. It’s a miracle

How does this still have ads?

<a href="">3:15</a> corona....

<a href="">12:32</a> allegedly the amount of civilian/japanese soldiers/ american soldiers would have been even greater if we had done a regular invasion. i don&#39;t know if that was true or not though looking at previous battle casualties on Japanese soil compared to both bombings combined it seems about right

Both cities were locations of military goods factories. So they bombed the factories who produced the guns, ammo, bombs, planes, etc.

<a href="">11:47</a> that&#39;s called musking

How do I mute backround music?

we drop the bombs cus they eoultdint surrender

<b>Chris and Zach in PewDie video? WAT THE FAK nah but seriously</b>

I love these

Allan please add crused comment

I just realize how much editing went into this video, Amazing

They bombed 2 city&#39;s because Japan was about to surrender to the soviet union and wanted to have more control over peace talks and to flex on the union

We got ant problem at home too, and i started to be friends with them. Im giving them bread and sometimes hold them ın my hand. They&#39;re like my pets now. Cuz when i go to outside, other outside ant trying to bite me but the ones at home never. They actually love me,.. I think.

Hiroshima had a military base, and Nagasaki had several commercial steel factories and shipyards which were being repurposed by the Japanese military for Naval use.

Help me out y’all

What is the music in the background? This isnt lord of the rings x)

<a href="">12:42</a> Pewds, they were supposed to bomb the capital instead of Nagasaki. The reason is because of the weather (more like clouds)

<a href="">12:23</a> ....wow.  i must be an ignorant american.  i didnt realize that..... japan bombed a u.s military base, and the u.s responded by bombing two civilian japanese cities??  is that right??? it sounds so strange to say it that way.  that sure isnt how they teach us here

If your pp was big it would sound louder than a small pp because it has more power.I think.

I don’t get the Peter Pan joke can you tell me

<a href="">12:31</a> it’s called a power move

<a href="">3:01</a>

Marzia did a small pp move
Lmao he looks like 2016-17 PewDiePie here

hey wouldya look at that... I&#39;ve been mentally scarred

<a href="">3:30</a> he talked about a nuclear fallout... were living a fallout now

That man was the reason 2020 is off to a bad start

So basically I have to put my pp into the toilet water so that my sisters friends think I have a large pp

I’m ten but I get 90% of these comments

Pewds: &quot;I don&#39;t understand war, I&#39;m Swedish&quot;.Viking Ancestors: &quot;SHAME&quot;
I’m not completely sure but I think what happened is that Hiroshima which was the first city to get hit by the Nuke was a test to see how much damage and it was a good opportunity to get revenge for Pearl Harbor. Then I think the U.S. and the Japanese were in combat against each other and the Japanese were relentless, so we nuked them again in Nagasaki to give them one last chance to give up

How rare to get a heart from pewdiepieDay 1

Felix: This video is definitely not getting monetized.The video: Are you sure about that?

I just watched his latest cursed comments video, wow, he changes his personality very often

One of my favourite videos of him.

<a href="">3:19</a>  .. well not correct but we still got fucked anyway

goddammit that story about marzia not letting you yell out the window has been too relatable in every way too many times I really feel that

i get that they would have bombed civilian cities, but the Japanese civilians were so brainwashed that they would rather die than to be in AMericas control so on the islands that they fought for, civilians were committing suicide all ove rthe place to the nuking of Japan saved more lives than it list.

the first was for revenge the second was to get the point across that it wasn&#39;t a fluke

I watched this.<b>M Y   P A I N   I S   H A R D</b>

That was because America wasn’t involved in the war and they attacked America so America attacked back twice as bad

although pearl harbor was a naval base, it did have many civilians. the two bombs were also after years pf japanese torchering american prisoners of war civilian or not.

Is it just me or when pewds is self aware of demonitization, hes not demonitized... hmmm

Pewds pewds pewds, you little brain, for the guy sagging his pants you should have just said nice butt n-word

I would use baby Groot to start a fire to cook baby Yoda into food for baby Appa.

<a href="">12:40</a> the estimated casualties for a ground invasion of japan was around 1 million overall. The citizens were ready to give their lives and so were the US troops. My great grandfather came home because of the bombs. He wouldn&#39;t have survived the invasion. He was positioned for some of the first waves.

Plague doctor isn&#39;t a viable career option2020: you can say that again pal

Pardon me but what the fuck is an A-postroph

Omg I got a pewdiepie merch ad before this

They bombed it because if the us military had to go to Japan to take out troops they didn’t want to shoot a civilian on accident. Most people think that they saved more live by using the bomb.

I don&#39;t know if anybody will even read this, but the second bombing in Japan by USA was actually a bit of an accident. A plane holding the atom bomb was not intending to drop the bomb, but it got deserted or something and it was running low on fuel, and the bomb (nicknamed Fat Man, or something like that) was heavy af. So, the pilots were like &#39;Ay, screw all this. We need to get home or we&#39;ll die&#39;. And so, they dropped the bomb and flew away. I may be wrong at some points, but I watched a documentary on it ages ago. (got inspired to write this after <a href="">12:25</a> ).

Did Lou get a girlfriend though?

To explain the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after Germany’s defeat: The way the president saw it we had 2 options1. Full out invasion.2. Bomb major cities until the Japanese government conceded.A full out invasion would have an estimated 600,00 civilian casualties, and the bomb engineers made the bomb less radioactive and explode in the air as to hurt as few people as possible and not poison their crops.

Go to <a href="">3:20</a> and there&#39;s one in town. Btw who else is watching quarantine?

<a href="">0:39</a> how is he now?

The plague doctor didn&#39;t age well...

Civilians were killed at Pearl Harbor as well as soldiers

what if they were adopted siblings?

T’was to frighten russians

<a href="">5:28</a> that is actually really impressive
