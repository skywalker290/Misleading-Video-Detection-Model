This movie is Thor Ragnarok in the in F&amp;Fverse 😅

I like how they ripped the cab off of a semi and placed it on a sick looking car

NITROUS!

<a href="">1:27</a>

Does anyone feel bad for the pilot when he got thrown out the helicopter😢

Ah yes the trucks we need in forza horizon 5

No Trucks And Helicopters who were harmed in this film!

I love the buildup of the fear of them about to get lifted in the air to the sudden arrival of the brothers all tinkering with their controls to the beat of the music. Couldn&#39;t have created a &quot;the playing feel is levelled now Brixton, we&#39;re coming for you!!!&quot; vibe any better. Gets me pumped every time I hear &quot;we&#39;re coming uso!!!&quot;.

Jason Statham is awesome and he has lots of skills to defeat bad guys!

In this clip roman is not the tribal chief😂

Klife Diesel
Imagine Jimmy, Jey, and Solo in this movie.

Funny how the helicopter couldn&#39;t simply lift the tiny truck and fly off

Dumbest movie and dumbest scene LOLOL

Bro was laughing until hob&#39;s bro clicked nos

What some Ober Ami shit
Huh. Didn&#39;t know Optimus guest-starred in this film.

A wonderful fairy tale
What a good chain, it withstands so much pressure that I think it must be made of Adamantium or vibranium😂
Oh I call BS! That blackhawk can lift 9,000lbs. It sure as hell would lift that car off the ground

bullshit

What if they accelerate the helicopter so that the vehicles lose strength and balance?

Wow, this scene has like ALL the bullshit. haha

I can&#39;t believe they did my man Optimus like that.

Is this a true story?

relly!!! they can hear each other?

it&#39;s just occurring to me that this episode was every bit as the same thing as one of these action endian movies

You could&#39;ve called Captain America. He will catch the helicopter with his bare hands

The pilot didn&#39;t listened to helikopter hard enough and didn&#39;t have enough para kofer power  so he lost. Classic.

This man was a DEA agent, I don&#39;t know if you remember that

Istg Kal is my favorite Hobbs besides Luke

I wish they would&#39;ve kept the rest DJ&#39;S line in that helicopter scene.  😅

<a href="">2:18</a> why didn&#39;t he just bring his solar train zord?(This guy played Solaris Knight in Mystic Force)

I am straight out speechless. what did I just see?

Terrible nonsense.. I don&#39;t understand how someone can be so blinded and believe it 🤮🤮

To think Brixton could have just fired the chopper&#39;s weapons before the other trucks came in and blown Hobbs and Shaw up.This is an F&amp;F movie,no one ever gets hurt by their own explosives.

Physics has left the chat

Dwayne Johnson (hobbs): i need a distractionRoman Reigns: Uh-Ah  (and give the villain the spear

This is literally one of the 3 only scenes in this movie that actually gives fast and furious vibes to it

This was exactly what I wanted to do as a kid

Haha...so genial

；；－－k
Never has such garbage been put on film

I expected mom to show up last and attach car to the others.

MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!!

This would actually be a great clip to analyze in a Physics class

Imagine that there was a room with moviewriters, brainstorming about this movie and someone came up with this scene and proposed it to the other writers

This is like the Gi Joe Comic only someone filmed it without the license.

Considering the fact that in reality several things will happen like the chain breaking, Blackhawks are not Chinooks they dont have that lifting power to pull 4/5 trucks, Hollywood juz love to use NOS as jet pack booster for vehicles. Still this scene is awesome......hahaha

And a friend of mine said that FF is realistic

Those are the all mighty truck and rescue trucks

I like the all mighty truck and rescue trucks

This is the easiest way to teach kids Toretto and Hobbs&#39; Law of Physics, show them this movie + the FF franchise.

Fun Fact: ur mom was in the car so it was too heavy to lift

Americans believe in such “Children’s” stories. cartoons. Heroes from Cartoons and in Russia there are real Heroes who stopped the Nazi Hordes in Moscow and Stalingrad.
New interpretation baby for a turnip)
That&#39;s trucking awesome

What is the title of the movie?
<a href="">2:17</a> this one made me laugh lol

I know NOS works absolutely nothing like this, but ngl that was fun to watch

I&#39;ve seen the behind the scenes of this and the only thing thats not real is the big chain on the helicopter and the truck hobbs and shaw is riding..The car chain were real! it&#39;s really cool!!

FORM THE MEGAZORD!!!

I swear this is the best ff scene

A helicopter like that and still armed, only such a situation is seen in movies.
Most beautiful truck ever it looks like hot wheels.

Ah fast and furious the call of duty of movies

Stupid muvie

I&#39;ve seen this movie b4 when I was a kid. I didn&#39;t know Roman Reigns is but now I know

<a href="">2:57</a> is a great quote:”hit it with the moonshine

That gun pod would get ripped off the chopper from holding all those trucks

What kind of stupidity is this?
I&#39;m so glad I never watched this 😂😂 that&#39;s some powerful NOS giving that AWD vehicle mega front wheel traction 😂😂😂😂😂

Cartoons

A &quot;movie&quot; for idiots. Guwno.

How brainless do you have to be to come up with something like this?
Bulshit

God, this is such nonsense.
As a person who studies in the physics and mathematics stream, I declare that all this is bullshit
What nonsense
freaking awesome movie

Jeez, never watched this move, no wonder why. What a bs scene

They film anything at random and make millions from it, but it’s impossible to catch a helicopter with a chain
Lies have limits.
Just because you&#39;re fast doesn&#39;t mean you have infinite frictionHaha NOS goes brrrrrrr

This is the reason I don&#39;t go to the movies anymore

Movies are getting dumber and dumber

)))))) what is the name of this wonderful nonsense???
In the style of Indian cinema
Indian film? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Movie for stupid people.

Complete crap...
Ahahaha fak pussi
Americans can make comics!
Even OSTURAG was not installed yet))))))))))
What a crazy mess.
This is pretty much the same as when they take down the plane so just remaking scenes

no thanks

Just so we are clear, we all know that helicopter can lift that approx 6000 lbs of truck right?  Right?

There is no way a black hawk could do all this. If you are going to do these sort of stunts, at least use a helicopter that could probably do it. This reminds me of that harrier scene in True Lies.

In reality, had the helicopter been in attack mode, bye bye Hobbs and Shaw. Movies is magic.

A Blackhawk can lift about 9,000 pounds. All the weapons on that one are taking up a significant portion of that weight. Under ideal conditions, it might be able to get one end of one truck slightly off the ground. There&#39;s no possible way it would be able to lift several trucks at once.Also, the &quot;hit &#39;em with the moonshine&quot; bit... just no. For one thing, if your tires already have limited traction, spinning them faster is going to do nothing but kick up dust. More speed means nothing if the traction isn&#39;t there. Second, two tires on the ground wouldn&#39;t be able to pull four trucks and a helicopter around that corner, even on pavement. All four trucks 100% would have gone over that cliff (assuming the helicopter could even lift them in the first place). Contrary to popular belief, nitrous is not magic.I know I&#39;m being a buzzkill here, but it&#39;s pretty hard to suspend disbelief for scenes like this. I wish I could turn off my brain.

😀😀😀Bollivud

Storytellers
Broke every law but the law of gravity........well, guess they broke that one too, LOL

Nobody:Hobbs and Shaw: We&#39;re murdering physics btw

Epic.

😇👁️👁️👌🐝👍 Reference tactics!
this scene reminds me alot of the scene where dom and the gang stole a bunch of fuel tanks from a long fuel truck

this seems really stupid, why do ppl watch these?

Fast and Furious franchise always putted amazing taste vehicles &lt;3 except the 1st 2nd and 3rd one those were ricers level except doms ones are pure gold &lt;3

Is it just me, or that car is autobot impostor?

That's a lot of lies in a single sentence.
&quot;He wasn&#39;t breathing hard enough after pulling the chain back to the crank, WHICH, BTW is another 27.8 sins added🤓.&quot; -CinemaSins probably.

Hit the NOS nitros 🔥🏁💨<a href="">3:01</a>
I wonder if anyone is watching this FUCK?!?
Guys you gotta realize, we can&#39;t have fun scenes and movies like this if all movies were made 100% realistic.

the sheer stupid shit!!!!
A 6 year old director?

Despite this movie and all the recent ones were out of tune from racing and the originals, when he hit that moonshine for a second it felt like the good old Fast and Furios movies

They need to nerf that moonshine

That truck is cool as fu k though

Science-fiction

I wonder how Romain rain felt

This how it feels playing just cause 4 lmao

Forming a Megazord with Kal Hobbs

Bollywood movies : finally a worthy opponent.

That Blackhawk must&#39;ve been like... <b>WARNING ENGINE OVER TORQUE</b>

Fuck physics and common sense!
😂😂😂

Brixton&#39;s laugh at <a href="">2:45</a>

<a href="">1:26</a>-<a href="">1:28</a>

Brixton is like where is that chain gonna go 7 seconds

These rigs hella dope 4x4 action🔥
I watch every excellent series with excitement 👍
It ain&#39;t a Fast &amp; Furious movie without tricked out cars.

Bollywood is taking a break...
Well, what the hell, how is it possible to throw a chain weighing 40-50 kg over 20 meters?🤣🤣🤣
I can&#39;t wait the next film and Dom&#39;s family colab with Hobbs&#39;s family

I&#39;m more than happy to ignore the particular masses and thrusts, as well as the fact that Brixton only seems to pull up harder when each truck is added. It makes for an enjoyable watch.However... That part (<a href="">2:50</a>) where Brixton tries to pull them off the edge... If there&#39;s too much weight for him to lift them up, what&#39;s pulling them off the road going to do, other than crash the heli? xD(I guess <i>maybe</i> he wasn&#39;t trying to pull them off, but to disconnect the trucks, perhaps, or get one of the chain to panic and disconnect, but it&#39;s a huge risk given, if nothing else, they might not <i>be</i> able to disconnect the trucks! :P)

Helicopter could barely hold itself against one truck, then all the sudden it&#39;s lifting three?

The car vs helicopter is pvp but is shet xd

Tales of Hollywood
Does anyone know the music?

He is biting the ass, everyone had one car, so he did not lift it, he is lifting three-four cars, wow filmmaker.
Is this movie considered science fiction? Cause it sure as hell is far from reality.

Pathetic movie but so is the franchise I suppose

Your presentation exposes your lies
Such nonsense.
Bye bye vin diesel fast and furious welcome hobbs and shaw

Seems i fall asleep on this scene

The fact that Hobbes brothers were doing this in thongs show how that are real Samoans like me🥰

Im not fan of these FF movies since tokyo drift. But damn this looks fun.Edit: watched movie and action scenes was so ridiculousny&#39;s absurd thats why i loved it :D haha

at <a href="">00:35</a> he&#39;s talking like sonic

Remember when Vin Diesel and crew said FF6 was going to be the last film they made out of respect for Paul Walker passing away? Me too.

-Pull up!-I can&#39;t, we are chained to a car. -Hey, they are adding another car to this chain thing!-Ok, let&#39;t pull up just a bit.

<a href="">2:57</a> ngl this bit was sick

Physics: dame dame
I swear the third brother (last one to attach to the cars) is my favourite because of how enthusiastic and giggly he is

<a href="">1:57</a> was that really a necessary shot? 😂🙄

For a moment I thought it was a towing hot rod

It’s amazing how the guy in the front vehicle heard the rock all the way from the back when told to switch the nitro’s on

I doubt the rock heard Jason talk and vice versa

I don&#39;t know why Hobbs is calling Maui ooso 😂

This movie is literally 9 year old me playing with my Lego City sets.

Really that big chopper lifts an big tractor

It&#39;s happening in tamil cinema graphics Same in Hollywood orginal

How could that guy hear what rock was telling him to do🤔🤔

<a href="">3:17</a> the third car forgot to press the button but still got boost! 🙃

1. How much weight can that Heli lift?! No seriously!!2. If it can lift all that weight then lifting the first triluck must have been super easy, bearly an inconvinience!3. Why I&#39;m questioning the non-existing physics of this nonsense?!

Me: &quot;You can&#39;t just ignore physics when you&#39;re making a movie.&quot;Also me: &quot;The Fast and Furious movies are a masterpiece.&quot;

Brixton * casually just push the pilot out the helicopter * Brixton: And have a day off! Me: Brixton is really nice.

We gonna ignore the fact that he was fighting in a diaper then shows up on the truck fully dressed lmaooo

Wow wow.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Power of Ratrod<a href="">2:56</a>

God I love that peterbilt

welcome my insland you........he did not finish yet 😭

Karma <a href="">2:45</a> watch to the end when the moonshine black super man didn&#39;t laugh

Hobbs in Fast Five: <b>just a cop who arrest the bad guys</b>Hobbs in Hobbs &amp; Shaw: <b>fighting Terminator</b> lmao 😂😂😂

After watching this, I can see why people wanted to see Idris Elba as Bond.  I&#39;m still against a dark actor playing the part, but he was brilliant in this.

They all seem like they are in a game they just take it for fun

I love how fun and wholesome this movie is

Crazy
<a href="">2:18</a> they didn&#39;t get lifted because of that brothers weight

Now there is no difference in indian film industry and Hollywood 😂😂

Wye wood Dey have online Wepens

Yeah, that’s not how ANY OF THAT WORKS.

wow DAMN BRO I LİKE İT THİS MOVİE*?????!!!!!!.
When you aced PE but failed physics

Ah, we finally see the return of the F&amp;F franchise&#39;s trademark &quot;FTL in a bottle&quot;, AKA Nitrous.

The brother love demonstrated in this movie is really touching and wholesome man❤️

Why didnt he just shoot them

This secene is insane who like this scene like

Hit em with the moonshine

The USO’s are in the movie

Tow trucks are terrifying now

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
This scene was is my  fav scene ❤️

From where I can get that chain????

HOW HEAVY IS THAT TRUCK?

His Brothers Have Is Back That&#39;s Up What 🎬🎥

A bit too much don&#39;t you think?

NOOOOSSSSSS!!!!!!!!

They should rename this from Hobbs and shaw to how to piss off Issac newton the movie

<a href="">2:17</a> this guy is my favorite for some reason

Fun Fact: How many of you know that another brother of Hobbs you see at <a href="">2:17</a> actually played the role of Doggie Kruger aka The Commander in Power Rangers SPD...??!!!🔥🔥

Nobody:Shaw: 👁        👄 👁
Let&#39;s just skip physics

can we talk about how it goes from night in the last scene to day in this scene to night in the next scene

Damn
<a href="">3:00</a>

Parents don’t get it?
Shoot the Rocket Launcher from both side wing!!! 😂😂😂 And BOOM!!! GAME OVER!!!! 😂😂😂

Shocar

why cant he simply shoot the chain to get rid of it.

Hobbs shaw and optimus prime

What can&#39;t Dwayne be the next protagonist for gta

Is there a game where you play as them?

It’s like Idris Elba waited for them to hook their cars together and then lift them up

Salmon boi vs Hobbs and Shaw

All this idiot had to do is shoot the chain movies piss me off sometimes lol

He ain’t captain America
Everybody saying where&#39;s the physics on this scene?!?!?!Duhh, of course what would you expect on a Hollywood movie a real physics???

Everybody going on about physics, meanwhile I&#39;m losing my mind over how many perfect hook-and-catches they made with those cables ON FIRST TRIES!!!

Jason wants Dwayne cheated on with 14,000 people.

One of the best scenes even though the physics ain&#39;t there

What is the movie name??

Indian movies these days

I turned off my brain cells to enjoy this movie.

As much of a joke this movie was, damn! Those trucks are badass

Ppl really say you have low iq when watching movies emphasis on movies cause unless they are based off real events damn near every movie is fantasy, fiction, unrealistic like the villains is an enhanced super human lmaoo with a motorcycle that transforms and can come to him damn near anywhere and this is not supposed to be fast and furious type movie I’m pretty sure this is own type of action movie just with the fast and furious presentation 🤦🏾 also the part where they went to Samoa wasn’t dumb it’s called strategy, the part about their weapons is actually smart and dumb cause for one your enemy can’t just pick it up and shot you but it can be hacked and you would be in a messed up situation it’s really how you perceive it honestly this movie was great to me and I didn’t know a lot of you don’t enjoy movies but instead just criticizes movies when a good 85% are not realistic and nothing more than fiction, fantasy etc. but hey it’s your opinion, it was great to me🤷🏽

Nitrous oxide means nothing at all if you don’t have traction...but HEY, thanks for assuming we are all idiots....

So ima say two things:First: Their aim is immaculate Second: Physics apparently don’t work for Hobbs and Shaw

So nobody gonna talk about where did roman reigns go after throwing the hooksEdit: I know he got in the car, I wanna know how

more fast and furious then fast and furious

Really enjoyed with all my Super Heroes...but I missed VD

Who chooses Allah SWT like.
Goodbye fast and furious about street racing

That last guy was too much xD

Ultimately Its not easy to kidnapped Hobb&#39;s Girlfriend and Shaw&#39;s Sister..😆

Wait does that mean he’s my uncle

Bro why my dads childhood friend in this movie bro

must be a semi with some GREAT torque figures for that pull tbh

this is car centipede

<a href="">0:50</a> why did he not just ask &quot;bro do u mind?&quot;

Many peoole might have missed End credit scene okay I will now spoil you.Nick Fury : I&#39;m here to talk to you about Avengers

Parents : awww look at them playing with the cars and chopper : sons mind you bad guys will die

I am waiting for the choper shot them. But NOOOOO. I waste my time here

Who said Helicopters Are Better Than Trucks, Truck Are bette

Screenwriter: And so Hobbs is going to grab a chain holding the bad guys in the helicopter in one hand and hold on to the truck in the other hand to prevent it from flying away. Head of Studio of whom the screenwriter is presenting to: Oh that’s ludicrous!!Screenwriter: No, it’s Dwayne Johnson. Head of Studio: Never mind.

I like how tow truck was also equipped with nitro

This is good opportunity for Chevrolet . I know.

Here come wwe superstar
This picture is Send this picture full
when ur supposed to be invincible but two bald men yeet you

Rajinikanth did all these things before

With a flying helicopter that close, how did they hear each other...

when africa finds out about super cars

The logic is out of the window, but the whole idea of brothers helping out each other brings a tear to my eye. :&#39;D

Name is movie

These feels like a hot wheels comercial xDAlso: that is a military modified chopper, a chopper that size could easy lift around 30,000 pounds, and that truck in the beginning is roughly 8,000 pounds, so that chopper should have taken off with no problem xD

its so over the top but i love it

Excellent stunt 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That&#39;s Roman reigns from wwe  and  the rock

this whole movie was just for the creators to have fun lol

This movie put those ridiculously supehuman Indian action movies to shame

i wish the fast and furious sequal would go back to be like the first 2 movies...STREETRACING

Those who know from TikTok are Belek🤣🤣🤣
Every one gangsta until fat guy comes in his car

And they speak about salman khan and tiger Shroff

Scenes like this you can&#39;t even find in Dragon Ball Z

That was horrible

I just realized that when shaw yells &quot;were gonna need nore weight&quot; the guy in the next truck is more heavyweight omg... idk if that was an intentional thing or not lol

I just don&#39;t get that he could left all the cars when they got attached to each other but couldn&#39;t left the first one all the way up. 🤔

<a href="">2:05</a> this reminded me of the tow truck glitch me and my friends tried to do in GTA, every time we were launched into the air

That chain would&#39;ve snapped like a baby bird&#39;s bones

What in the hell is this movie?

<b>Physics has entered the server</b><b>Hobbs has entered the Server</b><b>Shaw has entered the Server</b><b>Physics has left the server</b>

What my mind sees when playing GTA Online 😂😂😂😂🤣😅

Y&#39;all be bitching about the physics but I just think it&#39;s fabulous.... You don&#39;t watch this for physics lessons. You watch to be entertained. And as for entertainment Y&#39;all gotta admit: it&#39;s really cool and wacky in a way that you don&#39;t really see that often

HobbsShaw

Not Helicopter vs truckHelicopter vs The rock

that is just stupid...I mean - if that heli could have picked up 3 cars, it could easily pick up the very first one, instead of &quot;fihgting&quot; with it :VNot to mention that is not how physics work ;__;

That helicopter was aimed directly at the truck why didnt it just open fire and end this horrible scene

wow super cheezy fake

Fentastic
Optimus prime vs blackout

Even tho this stunt is not possible the front car didn’t even have a front diff or axles

It&#39;s the best scene I like from the entire movie

Me Playin&#39;   &quot;Just Cause&#39;&#39; be like :

Cinemasin is going to have a field day with this one. XD

Why I see Keith Thurman here

Who's here because of TikTok😂
Who's here because they watch Tik Tok?
Physics: adios
Indonesia itself
I thought the car was about to transform to some kind of megazord.

Fear the moonshine!!

When he threw the hooks on the axles I died 😂😂

The scene were they, hung over the clip and pushed the turbo in, reminded me of the the Fast and Furious i wanna see

Why dont he aim at chain and brake it

I didn&#39;t know I would be so freaking hyped seeing NOS again xD

Why would there scrap trucks have Ricaro steering wheels ?

Wow !!
Brixton had all of that missile on his chopper and he didn&#39;t use any of them???

Shaw: We&#39;re gonna need more weight! Hobbs&#39; Brother: BEHOLD!!

If he could pull three and a half cars off the ground he would&#39;ve been able to pull just one 🤦‍♂️

so many usos

You were all fine with the robot superman and got mad at this? Lmao. Crybabies because diesel isnt in this one?

I guess now fast n furious will be racing with trucks

<b>Sir Isaac Newton has left the chat</b>

Mythbusters will have they&#39;re hands full with this one

Physics has left the chat

When did hobbs put on his shirt and pants

Why the helicopter didn&#39;t fire on the car?

Don&#39;t tell them about sense!

When Initial D goes too far

<a href="">1:02</a>c

Uh...pretty sure that whole time they could’ve used the 80mm rockets on the chopper to blow up Hobbs and Shaw. Kind of dumb on Brixton’s part for not having that happen.

I need boy friend

Dude I don&#39;t even care that this is absolutely ludicrous it&#39;s entertaining

This is a cartoon.  What a joke 👎

Sorry, God, I saw this
Its such as STUPID scene BUT ITS SO GOD DAMN FUN!!!!!

Anya: where are you Jones?Jones: chopper on route Anya😭

Just&#39;s Black Adam vs Helicopter

Why didn’t optimus prime do his job?

Why should I forgive you?
smashing pumpkins

Bunch of bullshit scenes in this movie.

wooooooow it took 4 of you to beat me

Does Physics apply to this?

Excellent. ♡ T.E.N.
People talk about physics but I really enjoyed this scene

If Fast and Furious and Just Cause 4 had a son:

I have a guilty pleasure of enjoying dumb physic&#39;s breaking luck scenes like this. There too much fun to watch for me.

full movies

I swear NOS is basically God&#39;s fuel in the FoF franchise giving hacked and 100% guaranteed wins no matter the situation

In reality, Hobbs and Shaw wud be hanging from the chopper midair while trying to climb up the chain which Brixton would cut and the rest of Hobb&#39;s fam would be stranded on the island with broken axles and bumpers

I love th rocks dad is wearing flip flops

Dumbest action scene ever; give me my 80s action heroes any day.

I hate action movies that use CGI too much.

When a movie makes you say: pinche mentirotas!

Hobbs: &quot;We&#39;re gonna need more weight!&quot;Dominic Toretto: &quot;Hobbs, on Your left!&quot;
Welp this is not a fast &amp; furious movie if doesn’t have cars and nitro boosts.

<a href="">2:17</a> me laughing from the trailer but now enjoyng the movie

they shouldve just blown it up...

Fast and furious 3 Tokyo drift was awesome.

At <a href="">2:21</a> I see upper and lower control arms and a tie rod, but no front axle. Meaning the rig is rear wheel drive. So how the hell does he later pull the whole mess with just his front wheels?

Can Rock do something better than somersault after getting stone cold stunner?Rock - yeah i did Hobbs and Shaw...

Best scene 😆

Do you guys know all those truck name ?

Thank God.. Newton is not there to watch all this.. otherwise he would have got a heartattack..

The Rock is the best

That truck is definitely optimus prime mini edit: chopper h megadron

This movie don’t have physics and is very dumb. But at least is soo entertaining and fun. I don’t care. I just want silly/cheesy action with my friend and fun time

<a href="">3:02</a> they stole this from the fast and furious

Still the best scene in rhe movie

If shaw, brixton and hobbs worked together they could possibly fight captain america

this only has in fast and furious that such a helicopter cannot lift a car !!

It was my first time watch Hobbs and Shaw it made my night when I saw the big dog in this movie 💕

Helicopter: I work for the army so my engines are very strong. And my physical designs are well engineeredTow Truck: lol whats Horse power?

Trucks perfect modified for this moment lmao.

<a href="">2:06</a>

The unrealistic physics is so confusing but whatever. Fun to watch.

So this is what happened after Pentecost retired from the PPDC.

Not really about cars

why god why;(

Roman reigns is good

Why would they drop them if the chain is still on the helicopter???? They would kill themself to!?

This scene has its own seperate FANBASE🔥🔥🔥

I think optimus prime help them them ,😅😅😅

that 2 tyre griping was extremely logicless and physics defying

Nobody?? that man in the second car oooooh dam umm

This scene defiles physics logics sanity everything.Quite simliar to those Tamil movie heroes who fight with bananas.

Love these scene.  😃

I didn&#39;t know that NOS adds more weight. 😆🤣

Was that Jimmy uso

I could only imagine seeing this on a morning walk

Did this last Tuesday. 100% accurate.

One of these dudes is a power ranger so like the quality of this films acting is equivalent to an adult scene

Could you please tell me the name of the film please ❤️👍
The more clips I see if this movie the more I need to watch it 🤣🤣🤣

What's the name of this movie
Ah yes so many kids in this comment section complaining Stfu this film is supposed to be dumb it’s supposed to be stupid but guess what kids it works This film was a blast from the start to finish

Didnt like the movie because its soo Hella over top and that&#39;s saying alot about a fast and furious movie where physics just hinders the script

Hollywood movies are never before ever after mindblock action scenes that&#39;s way they are no.1 movies in the world i accept it.  Any body accept this press like button👍

Great scene and all but why is he only pulling back more when another vehicle joins?

Parents: &quot;Aw, look at him playing with his cars and helicopter.&quot;Son&#39;s mind:

This is a dumb, fun action scene. That’s it. If you want believable, go see John wick.

Welp muscle cars are now muscle trucks

Me and the fam make fun of this all the time

fantastic movie in the cinema i was like WTF IS GOING ON but it was so cool and its crazy that they used a real helicopter

Civil war lol
Did you see shaw drift🤯 how? Me:from tokyo drift

A UH-60 blackhawk being pulled by a truck....1. Thats not physics2. I just wouldve used the rockets on the pylons of the heli

If you pull just one car, the S-60's engine torque probably won't hold and it will crash.
shaw: &quot;we gonna need more weight&quot;fat dude:*pulls up laughing*

&quot;Welcome to my island... Where physics doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;

Nice comedy :D

This move just kept giving new meaning to Jump the Shark every few seconds.....

The race track was where the 4 cars of samoans race super fast

Bad

Eris Elba: Have a day off.Me: don&#39;t u mean life off u killed the poor man.

How me and the boys play when we get cars and a heli

Not in this physical realm that could ever happen.. but it’s sure fun to watch

Rase ur hand if u like emportant ads not random

The annoying thing is that movies like this always have nerds complaining about physics I mean if u nerds out there complaining about the physiscs in this movie being bonkers why u even watchin it anyway?

Well I can personally say this is BULLSHIT

This is so stupid but I’m gonna let it slide

De javu
Is it just me, or do I want every one of those trucks they drove?

Mad max but its newzealand

A middle finger to physics.

Brixton has a unique history. He spent many years as the protector of the nine realms, and also had another job at a paper company named Dunder Mifflin. More recently, he also caught the coronavirus along with his wife.

My favorite scene, saw it in theatres and still haven’t bought it, but my favorite scene all together even with the physics crap 😂

In Hollywood, 100% are on hard drugs.

it was fun. ignore all the facts how unreal it is we all know that. meant to entertain. u idiots think iron man is a thing. so.

It is amazing how they all can hear each other in all that noise. Amazing.

Were the Usos in the movie? They should have been if they werent

Say what you will about this scene not making sense but I believe the fast and furious franchise don’t make sense they make car films with lots of action and I think this delivers true

Lol, this movie was asinine.

That&#39;s like 16 tonnes of weight to be lifted by a 4 tonne helicopter engineI dunno man. I dunno

No way he could hear to activate the moonshine blaster. So many background noises...

this scene was fun to watch who cares about physics lol

Pkkllp

The usos and roman

When did Hollywood started seeing Indian films? I wonder why ??????

Since when did Hobbs and Shaw became Captain America?

Disgusting movie
<a href="">2:55</a> if that truck isnt AWD/FWD (idk)  sure they will fall off the cliff

Yay roman reings
wow

Braun Strowman Should Be In This Video.

No cema cuhhh 😂
Hitting  boost and making the wheels spin would give you way less traction, not more, you&#39;re better off just putting it in park and stepping away.

Hobbs was wearing a skirt in the scene just before and now he got jeans and a T-shirt.

What is the name off the music at <a href="">1:54</a> i can&#39;t find

Is this a Chevrolet commercial?

this scene forget about physics but it well uses A LOT of friction

You know I have to say, despite the absent of Physics(Nothing knew with Hollywood Movies) I really enjoyed this Movie.

the biggest Bullshit ever

Where’s da USO’s broooooo
WARNING!This movie is rated PG for PURE GARBAGEChildren under the age of 13 will suffer mental retardation.

Really now, Hollywood?Are you clowns serous? Oh brother! Lord help us all.

Imagine a Black hawk pilot watching this...!!

All y’all in the comments talking about out how this is too unrealistic but there’s way worse scenes in moves than this lol, and y’all probably never seen a Fast and Furious movie then.

No trucks   truck

What a movie bone! The special effects in the movies are good, but they are already overused. 🤣😂
Who say this is not the fast and furious???Nos: <a href="">3:27</a> my turn <b>FUUUUUUUUUUUU!!~~</b> YEAH BOI THIS IS FAST AND FURIOUS RIGHT NOW

Part of me says this movie was absolutely ridiculous but the other part loved it because it reminds me how we used to love ridiculous action movies back then

Nice movie

What the hell kind of movie is this?
What name and type of helicopter is that ??

Now that is how you advertise helicopters.

Hahahaha
Best action....👍
Ngl the physics are oof but I really enjoyed watching this

helicopters getting beat by hot wheels

I Love This Movie By My Favorite Movie Actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wtf happened to this franchise

Best action movie

The Rock doesn&#39;t fall to physics

ĺ
It&#39;s hilarious 🤣 10/10
So a mid sized helicopter can carry the weight of 3 trucks? So without load at full throttle it must be able to break the sound barrier vertically. Lets not forget about the technology behind the front wheels of the first truck, able to get traction on dirt with the weight of 4 trucks and full throttle helicopter as resistance.

You have to tell me what the hell this film director smokes
Oh, America made the newest and most powerful helicopter... in the world... so a way out comes and puts it in front of cars... used and old... without... power... nor... dominance... and no... value... for the one... who made it... come on. I fooled the director
Goo shots

<a href="">2:18</a> gave me tofiga vibes 😂
Obviously this is so dumb but I love it because is fun.

No limits of stupidity

Such a bad scene....... getting tow is that easy on that speed one after another .... come on .....and what about unbreakable chain

Axq SHAREit
I hate to say it but this is the sort of car scenes I’d enjoy from a regular fast &amp; furious movie but there busy fighting remote cars and submarines

You know, that hely had guns for reason

Not a movie
this is why kids are bad at physics

member when this was just about cars i member

Maybe the name of the movie.///Maybe the name of the movie
<a href="">2:55</a>, <a href="">3:05</a>Thank God that Car was also a Front Wheel Drive.

Sorry Physics, we have failed you.

In the next movie Johnson will stop Elon Musk&#39;s rocket. He&#39;s been eating protein bars for 8 months now, to look more credible

<a href="">2:17</a> me when im in the driver seat of my dad&#39;s car

Lol, wth was that?

I’m soooooo confused like if the chopper is struggling trying to carry the first car then how can it carry the rest

Such imaginations.  Holiwood is kooku

People complaining about physics, when fast and furious did 20 seconds at 120 mph 1/4 mile.

So I guess that chain is rated for over 30k lbs or something

The wwe member with a gentle heart

Simultaneously the funniest and most masculine scene I&#39;ve ever watched. My dad and I laughed non-stop when we saw it.This movie is... pure cinematic genius.

The director of this movie got mad for completely failing at physics exams at college so they made Hobbs and Shaw to defy the laws of physics.

I need one of those speed booster button in my car.

Me : Blackhawk can lift 4.1Tons when it use Slings. Blackhawk in this movie : Nope. I can&#39;t

Enough, enough, enough
How the physics are crazy

Truck

They have obvious problems with physics and logic.

Me:Why is everyone talking about physics no one cares in the fast and furious movies just enjoy them and stop thinking about physicsPhysics:butMe:no one cares

Helicopter wouldve pulled all of those cars at one time

Smh movies will be movies false will be false

Ok, you can complain all you like, but you KNOW this wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; movie without a physics defying car chase featuring a load of crazy, tricked-out custom cars.

Who put the wwe 2 of them the rock more than hobbs and roman Reigns

This helicopter can carry up to 8 tonnes if it wanted to.

Goddamn I love this scene.

Mere humans are weak. The last thing to die is weak. The living is strong

Wtf i just saw

Is this normal ???

What I just watched is something a 6 year old can tell it is impossible.

Invest too much
It just goes to show what you can accomplish when you work together.

After watching this i thought the cars were going to transform and pull the chopper down

Super Comedies
Lowkey expecting Jimmy and Jay uso here and also rikishi but oh well

😂

its like two brothers from rick and morty.

idiotism

Hit them with the moonshine, because needing more power is required but actually larger tires would&#39;ve been a better equipped item!

I&#39;ve had this happen to me last week while I was on my way to work.

Funny.

Super chasing
Why does Hollywood have to hack the story..

Taking a helicopter down “ fun for the whole family “

Why helicopter did not fire.or use firepower?

Remember people this came out from a franchise that was based on realistic car races

All you physics haters need to chill. Clearly you didn&#39;t hear when Shaw said &quot;We&#39;re gonna need more weight&quot; 😂

I asked my physics teachers to explain thisBut they said that there&#39;s no physics class today

This is already a suck.!!!!!!! 😕👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 the HU-60 can lift more than 10 tons of shit.!!!!!
I don&#39;t know why everyone is so upset with this scene when it comes to &quot;Physics&quot;(Hint Hint)       &quot;PHYSICS!!&quot;

This kind of movies wants to make up stupid

That armed black hawk forgot fireworks.😂

<b><i>Avengers Age of Brixton</i></b>

Old truck vs Power full Black hauk,oh yeah.

Funny, I watch an Indian movie 😂😂

That is how they are smart enough than a helicopter trucks win

That is how the trucks are smart enough a helicopter

I love this scene because it feels like an 80&#39;s film, no sense of physics just action!

I&#39;ve skipped this movie cuz it is on the same level of unrealness as indian movies, seems I was right... too many bs scenes

There are 4 car pulling a helicopter No physics

Good work
<a href="">2:18</a>plus his fat this chopper is down

Omg  😂

This scene gives me goosebumps every time i see it ;w;

This movie was horrible

&quot;We need more weight&quot; fat guy comes in&quot;Activate the moonshine&quot; turbo mode engaged

IF YA SMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING 😄😆😄😆🤨
Why does the helicopter get gradually stronger? If it can lift four cars it should have had no problem lifting just one when they first hooked it

When did this turn into a Michael Bay movie

where is the name of this movie ?!

Bro 3 cars are like 5 pounds in that clip

everybody ganste until this truck comes

It&#39;s not the fast and furious, if there&#39;s no nitro

Watching this movie is like watching a whole 2 hr film of superman working at the daily bugel without bring superman.  Same universe same guy same &quot;story&quot; but no actualility of the core concept That is how i view this film. Still funny imo tho

I like to know the sequences of the cars coming together. When did they get a chance to plan all these things and have are peace in their heirs to hear each other?

Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter vs a custom Peterbilt semi truck rat rod, a custom yellow Dodge M37 truck, a 1967 Chevy pickup truck, and a custom 1935 Ford Truck Rat Rod.

Physics: You should obey meFF: We ain&#39;t need physics, we got <b>FAMILY</b>

I like the wild smile of the villain in the chopper hahahahaa😞😃

Because physics is for wussies.So no one thought of Gun - Bullet - Chain?

Physics looks different in fast furious multi verse

The thing that most annoyed is that all of this trucks are RWDBut <a href="">2:30</a> that&#39;s the only thing realistic

What's the name of that movie?
I’m wondering what Hobbs siblings names are.

When did we go from street racing to Avengers level threats?

Those trucks are so sweet

All of you kids saying they skipped physics, you should actually learn some lol. Just pathetic people.

Tomorrow
What a load of crap.

.....i have no words

Are you so cool in the life of Americans?

This movie was pure Bollywood

From a historical fact movie to stupidity cgi

Drive tires are up in the air, how&#39;s that peterbilt truck pulling???

By chance he lifted the first vehicle while the other was holding it, and... why couldn't he lift it before? Ok...this is the script and that's it
The power of flippers

Just don't suck,
Yes that&#39;s my home kauai

These movies would look better as cartoons.. Just getting so lame..

Looks like real events.

Guys, can someone send me the link to the movie?
Only in HOLLYWOOD 😂

Filimin adi ney arkdaslar

Time to get back to basics 2001, the direction of the franchise is in a quandary at the moment..

Just shoot that dang truck.

This is why i love samoa

If all the trucks just slammed on the brakes and ran in reverse they would&#39;ve ended the chase from the start.

Rear wheel drive truck keeps traction when the back tires come off the ground 🤔😂🤷‍♂️

<a href="">3:05</a> Surprise, thats N2o hahaha

<a href="">2:56</a> uhh no that car is long gone off the cliff

<a href="">2:07</a> introducing the new electromagnetic tow hooks

This movie  is rubbish

that front car was rear wheel drive when it pulled up so why the front wheels spinning

MH 60 Blackhawk has rockets and guns, doesn’t use them.   Ok

<a href="">1:09</a> turbo still got cap on i think

Physics: I&#39;m going to the supermarket don&#39;t ya do anything stupidHobbs and shaw:

Seriously, I want the name of the movie
That helicopter is a Sikorsky UH60, can lift around 5 tons of cargo, in real scenario it could play with those trucks like toys.

Worst car movie in history
The Rock needs to go back to wwe

They no have eyes

Somebody give me poison ....

what does this have to do with fast and furious?

“So how much CGI do you want to use?”Director: yes

GTA 5 Physics

I&#39;m calling it right now. This entire thing was a tabletop WoD campaign and this is the moment the GM began ripping the hair out of his head in frustration.

Trucks more better

Sooo fake but soooo COOOOOL

Reminds me of that time. Vanoss and his friends did a tow truck train on gta v

There may be no physics in this scene but still brings me back to the old fast and furious

What is going on these movies anymore, look at the first one compared tonthe newer ones lol

:D

Good

Are you friends, these Hollywood people have gone out of their way.
Just shoot at them

physics: &quot;i was crazy that day&quot;.

You can watch Rambo from the 80s and legitimately think, yes, theoretically it can happen, he can in theory dodge all the bullets and kill all soviet soldiers, but this??

Couldn&#39;t put an extra can of gas on a helicopter manifesting firefighters and equipment. Watching this is not even fun, it&#39;s so not close to reality, how is this fun to watch? Its worst then bullshit, at least bullshit is hard to distinguish from real thing sometimes 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷‍♂️

Not a Chevrolet shill but I just love chevrolet cuz Chevroles are best, as seen in this movie, where Chevrolet save the day, of course by being a chevrolet. Did i forget to mention Chevrolet?maybe my brain work better if it was made by Chevrolet.Edit: Ended up buying 4 whole Chevroles. my testosterone is increasing.

My favorite part of the whole movie

I wasted a few dollars renting this thing. It was ridiculous

I like how the show the suspension and inside engine.

<a href="">1:56</a> chevrolet

Be careful the Russians with the bald and with rambo these barbarians leave them without a helicopter
What a load of rubbish

They need 100 cars

That’s 4 cars wow

Fast &amp; Furious, Hobbs and shaw: <b>Flying cars</b>Gravity: <b>wait that’s illegal</b>

I'm serious about lying movie...I would never see shit like that
Can that be done or is it just a movie?
If they made the movie this make it more realistic that Apache what did you just blow to s*** right out of that truck we wouldn&#39;t throw him out of the helicopter because he has a safety harness

What a sod&quot; and the type of film I like to watch, can anyone tell me the name of this film?

Spectacular on-screen performance.
I&#39;ve seen it all 🤦🏾‍♂️
Hey Jason Statham, did you ever see the George Clooney interview?  The one where he talks about keeping the Batman costume on the wall of his office to remind himself what happens when you take a role strictly for money? ?

This makes all the dumb crap in the fast and furious movies look smart. Daaaagone boys,  I can&#39;t believe that Jason Statham and the Rock could keep a straight face long enough for the crew to film this garbage.

Stupid scene

Goes to show how life can beat technology

They said that they are disabling the laws of physics for now.

Ampuki suarpes fokio car
In reality the helicopter would pull the truck

everyone should have probably been dead around the 3 minute mark but ok

Very Good picture Sir ji

I Love it Hob Muvi Lovely Looking

All those trucks must of had all wheel drive to continue to move forward with helicopter raising the rear end and it&#39;s still speeding down the road

What a stupid scene. Whoever thought of it NEEDS examined. Whoever produced it needs institutionalized. Whoever paid to see it needs worse.

PHYSICS: “...What about—“THE ROCK:“IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK!!!”

What&#39;s with the comments.... It&#39;s entertaining and both are doing a great job. It&#39;s an awesome movie

More like superhumans than super furious

Shit movie with shit actors
Gta online flaahback.
Shaw:&quot;We&#39;re gonna need more weight!&quot;<b>Brings in the big guy</b>

What a load of s**t

I know this is only a movie but in real life a Blackhawk helicopter cannot lift if possible Maybe one of those small Vehicles up in the front but other than that that makes up for good entertainment.

It&#39;s like Fast &amp; Furious 6 all over again.

The limit is crossed

Movies have become stupid.  That could have been cool but they went too far and ruined it.

Possible name of the movie
