Every time we watch the trailer and we wanna know his name again

Endgame was Marvel&#39;s peak. Thats it

Back when Marvel was at its peak. Back when I used to fanboy over the pure awesomeness of this trailer. Oh, the glory days.

The hype was so real fml

54% saved/50% deaths.
6 years &amp; still it hits hard!

We&#39;re so far from the end.

I won&#39;t stop saving lifes.

Who watching in 2024?

In 2024?

Now the next wait is for Avengers Secret Wars &amp; Avengers 5

Mcu will never live up to this

As much as I hate to say this but the Multiverse saga needs to hurry up and end already so that we can get that grounded level of the MCU we all love with a splash of cosmic movies here and there. I&#39;m just saying 

“ the end is near” yep the old Mcu is gone

I really wanna go back to 2018 rn

when marvel was good

2024 and still this masterpiece trailer gives absolute chills

Do

When i watched this trailer for the first time, i though captain america will unlock some new powers and that&#39;s how he will able to stop thanos&#39;s hand

Spider man and the avengers was the best out of the other surprises

Best trailer till date 18 feb 2024. 
Septrional

Who here from 2024

Gonna tell my grandkids this was the star wars of our time

Best mcu movie ever made
the Russo&#39;s are geniuses.

Probably the best comic book trailer and movie ever made.

Can&#39;t wait for this to come out !

Definition of perfect trailer

here to remind myself what mcu was at it&#39;s peak

Interesting looking back at this, there is footage that clearly was altered for the trailer cause Thanos is only wielding 2 stones when fighting Cap.

I watch this trailer every once in a while to shed a tear remembering the hype that the MCU used to bring us. It’s dull now. Never forget the infinity saga. It was truly epic. It was the Star Wars of our generation.

Who is watching this in 2024

PEAK MCU

Watched this movie 9 times till now Feel sad for IRON MAN 

anybody here

Someone in 2024
Take me back to when the mcu was at its peak

I wasn&#39;t a Marvel fan at this point... and I remember going to see Greatest Showman and seeing this trailer and thinking it looked AMAZING... but I never went to see it. In fact, I didn&#39;t get into the MCU until Spider-Man Far From Home so I missed the hype but I&#39;d already experience major movie hype during my Harry Pottr phase.

When I&#39;m done halfOf humanity will still EXIST.. Perfectlybalance as all things       should be.<b>******************</b> I hope theyREMEMBER YOU!

Still the best trailer I’ve ever seen

Sometimes I come back to this trailer and I get a tear to my eye cuz we used to have it all guys….we use to have it all

This trailer is now part of legend

One of the best trailers of all time.

People watching this after watching tom hollands leaking video

&quot;We have what Thanos wants&quot;Cut ToWanda&#39;s amazing boobies

<a href="">0:22</a>

God dammm they just don’t make them the way they used to man hahaha. So glad I was there for these.

This released on my birthday

How many people are watching in 2024‍️

Amazing trailer

How does this trailer still hit so hard 5 years later

Amazing Trailer Sir
<a href="">0:27</a> Lamfo look at the captions

WHEN CAP STOPPED THE HAND THO 
This is beautiful
Best Avengers Film Ever
2024 back again 
“We got one advantage, he’s coming to US” *proceeds to chase space ship flying away

Love this 
Whos here on 1st January 2024?

U should have said killing bad people it is more than 60 percent, not half of humanity

it was perfect,perfect, everything down to the last minute details

Anyone here after 5 years
This trailer is still beautiful 
Yup I’m doing a infinity saga marathon now lfg

you have to be there

Do you guys realize that theres only two infinity stones when cap was straining back

I remember people were guessing who would die bc of this trailer, Iron Man or Captain America. Turns out, half of the universe died. LMAO

You just had to be there

Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it&#39;s every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.



Rating: 9.6. Final Verdict: EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER.
Please marvel come back

Still live this

avengers studios

I love this movie

future generations will never understand the hype for Infinity War and Endgame.......

They will never replicate the hype and badassery of the Infinity War and Endgame trailer and the films.  All those years led up to this moment. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. Too bad the MCU is starting its downfall.

Make movie with Galactus or some villain like Thanos we need it!!!!

This trailer is more exciting years later than the entirety of Phases 4 and 5.

I used to watch this trailer about 10 times a day ...

It&#39;s now the last days of 2023 (December). Looking back I yern for the past. How the film-craft has perished. Infinity War was one of my top 10 cinematic experiences, up there with Raiders, Back to the Future, Aliens, ET, The Matrix, T2, A.I...and now all we&#39;re left with is studio heads forcing a set of political agendas via this once great platform/IP that eclipses quality character development &amp; narration, let alone solid engaging cinematic cues. A colossal shame. It&#39;s a cinematic crime. Effectively every film post Endgame has gone to the dogs. I know some are going to say Spidy 3 but that was more a re-hash of several than an Infinity experience. Good but no cigar.

Tell me his name again?Kratos 

Still watch , 2024 !

This is what i expect from Marvel movies, recently they are producing crap for us.

December 2023 still watching this iconic trailer

Jesus loves you!
Jesus loves you!
It&#39;s 2023. Sometimes I still come back and re-watch these trailers, to remind myself of how unbelievably exciting this time in the MCU was. I hope I get to feel this again in my lifetime.

What a confidence.. Revealing whole movie plot in few first seconds

Hey

That &quot;I hope they remember you...&quot; line means so much more now. :&#39;(

This is one of those &quot;once in a lifetime events&quot; - I remember how electrifying the theater room wa, maan

Infinity war and endgame have no repeat value in isolation.

This movie is a legit cinematic masterpiece

<a href="">1:16</a>

Just came back to watch this masterpiece… man I wish they made marvel like they used to

Back when Marvel was worth watching.

Watched this trailer 5x a day everyday untill the movie came out, had day 1 tickets, there was nuthin more hype than this

Tell me his name again! - Your death!

<a href="">2:11</a>

The penultimate finale. Brilliant! Love how it built up to Endgame. Second fav after Endgame

Why is youtube recommending me this after 5 years

That <a href="">1:28</a> to <a href="">1:30</a> is music to my ears until now

thanos setup is good but this time kang i think mcu did very hurry to setup without giving us a good story movie

Say what you want about this movie. Good or bad. But the hype was historical. There will never be a movie that made this much hype in cinematic history

Let’s Hope Marvel Doesn’t Switch Up The Kang Dynasty Or Storyline. Let’s at least Wrap Up the multiverse saga to the rumored “reboot” of the MCU if things aren’t going well. HWR was a great way to tease not just him, but all of him on the way to wreak havoc on the multiverse. Loki was a catalyst, as now, the timelines, while now growing peacefully, are now susceptible to hostile takeover by the Kang Variants, which I WANT to see. Let’s hope they’re bold enough to double down on the kang story to the end

<a href="">1:10</a> Thanos to the MCU

Its 2023 and this trailer is enough to beat all the movies they released in the last 3 years. Peak MARVEL was something else..

best MCU movie.

This is the best Marvel movie ever and everything since has been dogshit

It gives me great excitement when I watch it again after 5 years.
This trailer gives great excitement.

Mehn still watching the trailer

I just heard Wong in this movie talk about the beginning of the universe  he said at the beginning there was nothing.....and then it blew up.     Yeah...what blew up if there was nothing?     Infinity stones won&#39;t be coming with a bunch of powers from nothing, i&#39;ll tell you that.    The universe could not begin on its own, especially if there was nothing.    If there was nobody and nothing,  then there&#39;d still be nobody and nothing,  because nothing would&#39;ve been there to start something moving in the first place

The coldest marvel trailer

Goosebumps overloaded! Missing those days!

Wish we had this marvel now in 2023

Iron man switching to mega thrusters smoothly was one of the hype things we never know would exist

Omg this trailer was goosebumps ️

Best movie of marvel

Still give me Goosebump 
The movie that got me hooked with the whole MCU. addicted and sold completely    ahhhhhh! CINEMA

Watching it from 2023 and its still the best trailer ever made

GOOSEBUMPS
WOW!! Still gives me Goosebumps
The intro of each character in this trailer is still powerful.

Good! ☆☆☆☆☆
<b>R.I.P. TONY</b> <b>May 29, 1970 - Oct 17, 2023</b><b>I love you 3000</b>
They will never repeat the hype

Is there a version of the theme like what kicks in at <a href="">1:03</a>?

the infinity saga should be studied

Sahal, Haroon,jay and shijin

In one movie, Thanos becomes a culture icon and forever be a villain of the generation.

I WANT THIS MCU BACK SO BAD
The remaining Villains in Infinite War were sold out.
Thanks to all of you iron man you did give the mockers a chance hats off to your swag

Iron man dad looks  like  the  loki friend

In this trailer,when Thor found strombekar he used that time

I get this goosebumps every time

This makes me only more excited for when the trailers for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars drop

Mcu

Nostalgia 
Watched this trailer more than 100 times, infinity war had the best trailers of all time. Can&#39;t forget the hype that era of infinity war and endgame was peak marvel

<a href="">1:34</a>

The music at <a href="">0:10</a> gets me pumped every time 

this movie changed my life with how amazing it is. if i were to watch one movie for the rest of my life, i wouldn&#39;t watch infinity war all over the gain. just saying that it&#39;s great.

<a href="">1:31</a> chills

Boy, I still get amped seeing Captain America hold back Thanos with all his might.

Thor carried all infinity war.



This and endgame are the peak and history of the marvel what an era miss old marvel

<a href="">1:46</a>-<a href="">1:50</a> seeing Cap putting up that fight always gives me chills.

And I&#39;m still here in 2023

I miss this time in marvel

Tell me his name again ‍‍‍‍
I never commented on this trailer but I&#39;m commenting now as a sort of time capsule. I bet in a couple years I&#39;m gonna look back on this comment. Hi future me, hope you&#39;re doing well. By now I bet Avengers 5 &amp; 6 are out, or are currently being shown, and you&#39;re looking back at the ol&#39; infinity war days, hope everything&#39;s good. Written on September 9th, 2023.

Nothing will ever touch infinity war  and endgame, best movies ever!

am still watching this trailer like the movie gonna release next week

🇺🇸Scarlett🇺🇸Johansson🇺🇸33🇺🇸
I want hulk to sit on me with his gyat

Infinity stone is 23

5 years ago... So nostalgic

This movie is better than all dc movies

Who else is watching this trailer in 2023 (I’m still watching it because in my opinion this is one of the best trailers of all time)

Thanos Einai sthn eleutheriou benizelou 46 glyphada
Auto generated subtitles said santos instead of thanos

that small segment of cap holding the gauntlet in place, with both he and thanos struggling so hard did and still does give me goosebumps to this day

Eliminating half the universe life is disappointingly pointless as a goal. What does it accomplish? Life duplicates fast.

Robert you are a good man!!!

2023 and it’s still one of the best Marvel movies, (prob an unpopular opinion) not even Across the Spider-Verse can beat seeing this for the first time

And then I tell myself that when I saw War Machine it was a Skrull 
Is Gamora in the movie ? The one with the antenas

This and End game were the last GREAT pieces out of Marvel studios. It’ll never be like this again.

By the infamous mode

i just wish peter and dr strange had that encounter in the movie

1 Aug 2023 for memorial...

Who is watching this trailer in 2023

Top

This is one of my favorite MCU trailers. The hype and anticipation for this film was everything. Watching this opening night was . This trailer will never get old and will always get me hyped. My other favorite MCU trailer...Black Panther. Oh, to see Chadwick Boseman embody such an amazing character was everything. Watching Black Panther opening weekend was pure joy and excitement. I watch that trailer now, and tears begin to well up.

Nowadays with all the violence and shootings and division and negative stereotypes/racism that most people are doing too each other more than ever-Hmmm the Infinite stones and a snap  of the fingers to restart the universe and destroy the old universe with most if not all the wicked things it brought up-doesn’t seem like a bad idea like THANOS states-“Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be!”

Who is out here in 2023 hoping to get movie like this again from Marvel

;<a href="">1:41</a>

️10/10️ next gene
This sounds weird but I wish there was more of like “balance” in the movie considering it is all about balance. Just a Thought

Coming back to watch this in 2023, kinda made me mad how they made it look like Tony and Gamora were gonna talk, they never even met which bugs me. Even in endgame when Tony was with nebula, I woulda thought he would do soemthing to her body so she has built in iron man weaponry in her

right this is epic my mind is blown

When the trailer&#39;s actually made us believe Tony talked to gamora.

BEST. MARVEL MOVIE. EVER.

<a href="">1:36</a>  Elizabeth Olsen 
I am not here to wipe out the half population og universe . Everything is finished og you Are having the event live . Loki is giving away the reality stone . Loki this time give him a soap ( saabon)that the svine remove its germ. He is not a god dont be scared . It is me Taher Shah which is light nor og east neither of west which is Mohammad Taher Momand on red Norwegian pass .

Its been 5 years since thanos Slap the half of the universe

This and Endgame were such peak Cinema. Can’t believe this movie is 5 years old already

This trailer still brings me to peak love with the MCUs prime. So much I can forget the disasters of phase 4

the hype for this movie was unreal. Still remember waiting for the trailer, reading all those theories... uh those dayss.

5 years since marvel&#39;s peak

Soon you will all be seeing hulk dancing and singing, that&#39;s what happens when Disney has taken over

One of the greatest movies of all time

,,The end is near&quot;

Funfact : Though thanos wiped out half of the universe , infinity war managed to earn 2.1 billion dollar . Just imagine what would have happened if the whole universe would have witnessed this masterpiece in the theatre 

Who here after knowing Avengers: Kang Dynasty, Avengers: Secret Wars part 1, and Avengers: Secret Wars part 2is COMING

I like how no one talks about how the Peter and Doctor strange conversation got changed but this one’s just felt more natural and I want it back

The best year

 I asked this question where were you when the avengers Infinity war and endgame came out

The movies what came out the same year...

<a href="">0:26</a> with auto subtitle &quot;tell me his name again Santos&quot; 

5 years later and this trailer gave me goosebumps

I came here from a Christopher Robin meme

Somebody in 2023?

Spiderman
2023
I wish we could go back 

The best eva than endgame

This is one of the lifetime movie, I hope future generations will get to experience something like that.. the decade-long build-up, the hype, the delivery....

I really really REALLY hope that when secret wars comes out, its atleast half as epic as infinity wars and end game

I wanna watch it again 
What a trailor and what a movie it is

This is a &quot;real marvel&quot;

<a href="">0:55</a>  to  <a href="">1:02</a>
Thanos really was right: &quot;The end is near...&quot;Everything feel apart without goodwriting and mainly politics...The rest came by consequence of that.I hope some day, those glory days could back. I miss the inspiration; someone to look up too.

Still one of my favourite trailers

Good  
<a href="">1:46</a> have you seen thanos glove?, he only has 2 stones , thats because it would be spoilers...

i think wakanda battle is better than endame final battle

&quot;When I&#39;m done, half of humanity will still exist.&quot; Those lines just give me chills.

It&#39;s been 5 years but as a DC fun ,I can say that this movie will go down as the best ever superhero movie

Already 5 years ago

This movie is an actual marvel in the history of cinema

<a href="">0:11</a> what are they looking at

<a href="">0:56</a>

wow, 5 years already

they will never be able to make anything like this again

watching this and then end game for the 6th time

<a href="">1:46</a> In this scene in movie, thanos has 5 infinity stones but here he has only 2 of them.

Why there is only 2 stone in gauntlet when captain is holding it  <a href="">1:45</a> and <a href="">1:46</a>

Fun Fact: In the trailer Thanos got 2 stones in the Captain and Thanos scene while in the movie there were four stones in the same scene

Tom smiling like a kid

The baddest trailer ever

World surprise trail
I MISSS GOLDEN AGE OF MCU
&quot;Tell me his name again.&quot;&quot;...Thanos.&quot;<b>record scratch</b>Still the greatest intro to a movie trailer *ever*, perhaps THE best trailer ever.

The hype for Avengers Infinity War was incredible, I remember getting excited each time a new trailer came out, watching the movie opening weekend was an  unforgettable experience , good times 

how, how did we go from peak superhero films, to the absolute dumpster fires we have now save for  few exceptions

Why thanos has no infinty stone when he jump to captain america

Imagine going from this to phase 4

It’s been 5 years since THE BLIP. And it seems MCU should just go back in time to the same once again, and learn from their own marvelous movies to make something better this time.

This was the best, Hype for Thanos was at another level.

&quot;I&#39;m peter btw&quot;&quot;Doctor Strange&quot;&quot;Oh you&#39;re using made up names then I am Spiderman&quot;And now all people forgot Peter Parker and only know Spider-Man

Tbh... If any of Avengers had been in his supreme version..Thanos would have died by then.

I do not care how old this trailer gets, it will always be the MOST epic trailer in existence for so many reasons. 

i actually can’t believe it’s been 5 years

I thought cap was gonna die, and it would have been such an amazing way to go. He knowingly facing certain death but still soldiers on... chills.But then we got End Game, what a terrible movie.

The movie turns 5 todayAbsolutely my #1 movie of 2018! Thanos doesn’t see himself as a bad guy, he feels he’s doing the universe a favor being merciful His idea  seems more Malthusian, there’s probably better ways to save a species but in his eyes Thanos sees it as a simple calculusThis universe is finite as are its resources, if life goes unchecked life will cease to exist therefore it needs correcting, how many are the only ones with the will to act on such a thing even murdering trillions, the hardest choices require the strongest wills, an act of creation is an act of destruction, failure isn’t the end it’s what breeds new development The issues he brings up reflects our current ones like population control next to over using natural resourcesPlenty of biblical themes about rebirth (water being equated with feminism and baptism)The movie truly has everything for fans that have been keeping up with these films since 2008 from the comedy to the callbacks to many inside references to the comics The action is some of the best in my opinion since it goes so much bigger and switches from battling on earth to outer spaceIt’s crazy how the filmmakers are handling 20 characters since it is a big task but thankfully none of the scenes drag or feel like their smushed together because all of them are interwoven The score by Alan Silverstri is some of his best balancing the fight scenes, the epic ness, and the emotional moments Gamora is the heart of this story for the first half since she’s the adopted daughter of the Mad Titan and holds the key to tracking down the rest of the stonesJosh Brolin is perfect playing this villain not to mention the superb computer graphics with every detail of his facial expressions, his eyes, his skin pores and he makes a believable intimidating presence You also see his perspective at a certain point why he’s doing all of this and he’s the best villain put on film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe By the time it ends I was absolutely in tearsWe’ve grown so much with these characters over several movies and want them to come out on top it truly makes you wonder what’s in store for Part 2Joe and Anthony Russo have made the ‘Lord of the Rings’ of comic book movies and I’m very impressed!!!

if you come back to this trailer just to go back to that feeling you had the first time you saw it, you are a legend!

Awesome movie!

It has been 5 years already? Half a decade? Wtf?

coming here 5 years later,  still goosebumps

I forgot this always 5 yrs ago

Kang will never be half the villain Thanos was

but during that part he only has 2

in the movie thanos has 5 stones

The sence where captin america is trying to avoid the hand from thanos

THIS MOVIE HAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE!

remember when everyone thought cap had the stone in him because his eyes

I wish i had a time travel to travel back in time to experience this masterpiece for the first time

Rudy betrays us which is what people don&#39;t know... that is when the moon exploded. Currently it is WW2. You are only able to hire SuperHeros or God&#39;s, or Angels, or Heros through Time so you are able to fortify our Military. It is actually a Space War Theory. I studied similar to General Z his Diploma.

5 years ago. The world witnessed the fight that left the world trembling.

Amazing looking back at it now, and seeing the little things.  Thor conjuring the bifrost, but without showing Stormbreaker.  Cap pushing up Thanos&#39;s hand with only 2 stones in the gauntlet (at that point he had everything but the Mind)....but such a great trailer!

This is still the single greatest movie trailer ever.

I can’t believe it’s been 5 years since the release of the movie. Seriously it was amazing

The transition towards the end!! Omg gooooooseeebumpsssss

Peak mcu still getting goosebumps
5 YEARS. 5 YEARS and this trailer still hits HARD. CORE.We&#39;ve reached the year where Endgame takes place after this movie.I still got CHILLS from this trailer wondering what&#39;s going to happen... then I remember.

Who&#39;s here in 2023 ??

Will come back in 2025 to see if this trailer is topped by kang Dynasty trailer or not

PEOPLE WHO DIDN&#39;T GOT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATERS DON&#39;T BE SAD BECAUSE AVENGERS KANG DYNASTY AND SECRET WOULD BE JUST SO LIT. IT WOUL BE A TIME OF NEW MARVE ERA
5 year later We’re at the endgame now

What a legendary trailer

I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 5 years since this trailer came out

5 years ago since this trailer

5 years ago this masterpiece of a trailer released!

5 years :(

Goated

Plz marvel do something I wanna experience this masterpiece one more time like first time.

I’ve never been to the cinema twice in one weekend but I had too for this movie

Nothing will ever top this movie ever

Hello since 2023, I’m rewatching it and my heart still aches, ohhh and it was an epic time when the whole world was waiting for this film ️‍
Avengers Infinity War Official Trailer Black Panther Hulk Wanda Guardian of the Galaxy Thor X-Men future past

I need the team back

It&#39;s been 5 years... Still the Greatest trailer ever made 

This movie is 5 years old and still gives me goosebumps

THIS WAS CINEMA AND THE MCU until phase 4 ruined it.

Anyone notice at the @<a href="">1:40</a> mark if your headphones loud enough you’ll hear a boy you better something ‍️ when hulk buster being attacked

Infinity War, Endgame and No Way Home are peak MCU, just makes me that much more sad seeing the way MCU is today

The year 2023 and this is easily still the greatest war trailer of all time

Can&#39;t beleive that it&#39;s been half a decade already since this masterpiece dropped.

Just happy to be a teen when the MCU was in its prime. It&#39;s amazing to look back on this

Rip an respect bosman sir love u miss u
top tier story, top tier acting, top tier music, top tier cgi, and look at it all now. take me back

It’s 2023 and hear to say the part when iron was chasing the spaceship was epic

I was a senior in high school when this movie came out. One morning, just before class started, my teacher said before we begin our lesson he would be playing this trailer because it dropped that morning. Such a great way to start a morning at school.

I was disappointed we never got to see Gamora and Tony talk to each other. This trailer made me excited for it. It was a clever edit though. But still, think about it. Gamora is the adopted daughter of Thanos and Thanos&#39; chaos had been stuck in Tony&#39;s head for 6 years at this point. Tony would be full of mixed emotions when meeting the daughter of his greatest enemy. But of course, he did spend almost a month drifted in space with Nebula.

THE BEST TRAILER EVER MADE!!!

Best trailer ever
Thanos is as amazing as Elon Musk himself. XD.
Stan Lee tricks idiots by writing comic book jokes then makes them into terrible movies I mean Stan Lee is great for that..

Man seeing this and endgame on theater with my best friends was awesome i wish i could experience it one more time

Take me to 2018 again 

I still watching trailer 
I hope with my full heart and soul that Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars live up to this.

This trailer is inspiring

Infinity War was such a time to be a Marvel fan that movie is still hella cold to me and still the best MCU movie to date

That doctor strange micro surgery scene still gives me chill

I rmeber the hype when marvel used to be good

Thanos is a Communist. His plan assumes that gluttony will never become prevalent again, and that this “cleansing” will never need to be done ever again.

anyone watching my favourite one in 2023!

Man these were the good ol days…

I don&#39;t even know why but this Infinity War Avengers trailer still gets me hyped for the movie even though it was released 4 years ago.

Looking back this is so great like i didnteven imagine when i sww this movie and wasnt suprise

&quot;Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and GET THIS MAN A SHIELD!&quot;

Last scene - captain America full pack ️
Watching in 2023!! 

What Batman V Superman could’ve been. Not the extended cut the theatrical cut.

<a href="">1:10</a> that cape scene gives me chills everytime

4 years still got goosebumps 

<a href="">1:36</a> I screamed because i saw Wanda Maximoff, goosebumps!

maaaaaan the hype for this was so crazy back then

I am watching this in 2023 and remembering the time when MCU was at its peak &amp; now I just got thru 2022 when MCU was at it&#39;s worst

9 year old me before watching this didnt know anything about infinity stones my brother taught me bout it and hear I am 5 years later.

nostalgia vibes
Peak life

I still watching

The hype was something else,

love the kays cooking shoutout. she may not make the best food but she’s so purest

The film is really good
2023 and still here to get goosebumps 

The Infinitiy Saga is probably the best saga we had for all of the MCU

I believe Kang dynasty will never be big as Infinity War in my opinion even though we&#39;re a few years out

5 years

5 years still gives me goosebumps

2023! Anyone?

ok diana spencer was very very very very very mad about some human speices

2023 I&#39;m still here

The way it was said was too wrong and funny but I get what he was trying to say.

“We have he wants so that’s what we is “.‍️‍️
they made history and then delivered the trick that was endgame
9th of January 2023, just came back to check this masterpiece.

My favorite avengers movie

Goosebump whenever I watch this........

They don’t make movies like this anymore

It&#39;s 2023 I can still feel the hype. That feeling is once in a lifetime

Infinity war &gt; Endgame

Infinity War was the best theater experience of my life. Shame that the MCU has become terrible and overtired.

i wish i could go back to march 16th 2018

neel to ron man

One of the best movies ever!

&quot;We live In a society, Where honor Is a distant memory, Isn&#39;t that right, 2023?&quot;

It's beautiful
Idk why,But I still get goosebumps watching this trailer

The HYPE for this movie was the biggest I ever felt!

MCU is finished after Endgame 

Some people stop watching trailers after the movie.

But not us.

Fantastic movie 
I just watched  end game for the last time for a good while it was a great journey thanks marvel

Aliens only visit the United States and not other parts of the country.

Thor is best 

Future generations will not know the hype

I remember when I first watched this. I saw this opening day. Cant believe that it’s been almost half of a decade

I really hope Secret Wars everyone gets back together again and even more!

Already 4 years passed but still gives me same feeling and goosebumps ️

the first trailer for this was better

The best movie of all time 

The greatest imagination cor.

f” u,4 dollar order.
Seeing the Avengers roster for this movie really just added more value to the hype,never forgetting this experience.

THIS was the MCU at its peak. The theories, the first time cross overs, thinking Cap was gonna die, seeing the GOTG mix with the Avengers and the pure might of Thanos. Nothing will top it. Star Wars of this generation.

<a href="">1:42</a>

Very grateful to lived long enough to experience the hype for this movie waiting for two plus hours online for tickets

2023 still watching trailer got both on 

I hope they remember you

Why youtube recommend now?

G. O. A. T

How has it already been almost 5 years since this movie came out!?!

Experience of a lifetime. I hope next 2 avengers movies be also good

When I first saw cap’s last scene in this trailer - I legit got the biggest chills ever. This trailer was something else.

If you think No Way Home&#39;s hype surpassed Endgame and Infinity War, you simply weren&#39;t there for this hype

B

2018- Infinity War 2019- Endgame 2021- No Way Home.2023- Crimes Of Kingpin.2024- New World Order. 2025- The Kang Dynasty. 2026- Secret Wars Part 1. 2027- Secret Wars Part 2. 24 films that blew the audience away in the theatres. Three of the best marvel movies.

still best trailer in 2023
Best superhero movie of all time!!

<a href="">1:28</a>  
If they didn&#39;t nerf the Hulk this would have been a perfect movie :( that was my only issue.

Life was simply good when we were still waiting for this movie and Endgame

<a href="">1:13</a> they show thor getting his axe, with his eye still missing, in his cape powering up. Even though I loved his entrance this too would have been an awesome scene

When captain stops thanos&#39;s hand we can olny see power and space stone while thonos had collected 5 stones at that time

Perfectly balance

<a href="">0:28</a>

from <a href="">1:24</a> on you’re made aware the s* is real and the hype goes through the roof. so whoever edited those scenes so perfectly deserves a promotion and an oscar, at least. and I hope we get something like that for Kang and Secret Wars’ trailers. this is art.

Cap holding back Thanos in this trailer was just peak hype for me. The slow unveiling of Thanos over the 3 phases was executed so perfectly.

<a href="">1:45</a>

“I hope they remember you”Coldest line in marvel history

This is the prime of MCU

This is peak MCU and you can&#39;t tell me otherwise

Best MCU movie ever
What if ultron killed thanos in infinity war

In the movie he said, “I’m Spider-Man then” with a different delivery

Why am I hyping this movie in 2023?

This preview and movie lived up to the hype !!!!!

The huge battle being set in Wakanda was really awesome and I wonder how the Black Panther sequel will be like with that. R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER!!!

I dont think the future generations will understand the depth of the hype and excitement we felt waiting for this masterpiece Almost 4 years later, still the best superhero film ever made.

Greatest movie marvel has made to this day

I&#39;m eion by the way doctor strange oh your using your made up names then I am Spiderman

I&#39;m eion Spiderman
remember when marvel movies used to be good? nostalgia

Please, erase the movie from my memory, so that I can see it again as &quot;first time&quot; 

Watching the end of infinity war in cinema was chilling

this was peak we didnt know what we had

Still come here sometimes guys? to remember the hype that we will never see again apparently

Who&#39;s watching this after the announcement of secret wars

<a href="">1:44</a> I can&#39;t fully recall this moment, since I haven&#39;t rewatched the film in some time, but was this scene of Thanos leaping ever used?

This movie was much darker then a typical mcu movie I love it.

Even though this movie is old still I watch this trailer. It gives me more vibe than any other trailers

Avengers infinity war &gt; Avengers Endgame

Still the best marvel trailer of all time imo.

Rest in power, William Hurt, Chadwick Boseman, &amp; Stan Lee who&#39;s did the cameo in that movie 5 years ago.

Clever editing removing stormbreaker
Peak

Sometimes I like to come back here and remember what Marvel used to be... 

Who’s here in 2022?

This movie was Perfect but most of the stuff in the trailer was never actually in the movie

amazing i nostalgia with this film, where i always think this moment

The best Avengers movie. Hands down.

Gambora - ThanosSubtitles - Santos 
You know a trailer is good when it can still get you hyped for your second least favorite favorite Avengers movie

Looking back on these trailers, the Russo Brothers did not miss a bear

still getting those goosebumps

Was Avengers: Endgame Was Supposed To Be Avengers: Infinity War Part 2 Earlier In Production Stages?

This trailer always hypes me even after 4 years

Who&#39;s here in 2022? This trailer is legendary! The hype for this movie was unreal.

Yep in 2022  also its best superhero movie trailer

Infinity War &gt; Endgame

I was at the begining of my university when this trailer came out. Even though I watched all the movies afterwards, I started watching all the Marvel movies again, from the first to the last movie. It was one of the best period of my life..

This movie can beat all adventure movies even with it’s trailer. Absolute wonder

Easily My Favorite MCU Movie

Watching it in October, 2022, still giving Goosebumps

To this day i still get goosebumps watching this trailer. Truely EPIC 

Excellent I like it.
Came back here again to enjoy this trailer after 4years still i get those goosebumps 

The silent guardian, the soldier and our king is gone! seems like we lost a part of ourselves!

<a href="">1:12</a> this scene is deleted

Best film In Avengers saga:I️Thanos because Perfectly balanced in 2020
After this woke culture came......

Anas syed
<a href="">1:44</a> epic, goosebumps.lo bank to the cap
The bar was set to high, this is Best Super Hero movie ever made.   It may stay that way forever.

avengers 5 2025 avengers 6 2025

4 years later and it's still one of the best Marvel trailers!
I miss those times... where a trailer was released and everyone was really looking forward to the film
Its 2022, asto still get goosebumps

i have to watch trailers marathon to get back to the past and get hyped with ppl in the theater!!!!!<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw"></a>

so from this ...to phase four

One of the things I loved infinity war more than endgame was how civil war affected the outcome for this movie the way they were defeated by thanos really hit the spot that’s what makes me love infinity war a little more than endgame

I still miss Iron Man 

Never to be forgotten

I miss the time when people said that Tony was the jewel of the soul ️
I love how Spidey got a special clip at the end

1.11 i didn&#39;t see in the movie

<a href="">1:48</a>

One of the best trailers from Marvel can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 4 years...

This trailer alone shits on the Snydervers

After she hulk : Thanos was right

I&#39;m watching this trailer 4 years and I&#39;m still having goosebumpsWhat a movie 

Best mcu movie all time

&quot;Tell me he&#39;s name again&quot;&quot;Thanos&quot;The subtitle: &quot;Santos&quot;

End Game was good but Infinity War was something else.

Can&#39;t wait for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars ️

One of MCU best trailer if not the best !! still !!

This movie is surely gonna be one of the highest grossing movie of all time. Believe me 

MCU ended here for me.

An entire universe once 4 all 4.27.18 in 3D IMAX and dolby cinema

&quot;When I&#39;m done with the snap, the universe will be balanced.&quot;<b>Cap catches Thanos&#39; middle finger and pinky</b><b>Breaks fingers</b>&quot;Aight - i&#39;ma head out.&quot;ROLL CREDITS

105.359.814views

4 years now, watched the movie so many times and still getting goosebumps watching this trailer.

<a href="">1:48</a>

Hot take: this was the greatest movie trailer of all time

<a href="">1:37</a>  DR strange: AaAaaaAaAaAAAAAA

rn I don&#39;t see Kang Dynasty and Secret wars living up to the hype That Infinity War and Endgame did with Phase 4 being pretty Mid besides Wandavision, Loki, and No way Home, but it is still 3 years away and Wakanda Forever Will most likely be a good movie. I don&#39;t see how it will flop. It&#39;s going to be a super Emotional movie

I own the Blu-ray and I have a subscription to Disney+ and yet I still get excited watching this trailer!

AMAZING

Who’s here after the she hulk twerk:(

We have to prepare for Kang&#39;s danger because he will be more dangerous than Thanos

Y’all noticed how they made Peter sound more confident at the scene at <a href="">2:02</a> and in the movie he sounded more unsure if he was Spider-Man? 

2 years ago today our beloved king passed away. You are a real superhero Chadwick &amp; we all can’t wait to watch your legacy continue in the next black Panther movie! Wakanda Forever! ‍️‍️

No movie will ever create hype like this one did back then... Lifetime experience for us. ️️

Who’s here in 2022?

Iam in tears  time flies
Infinity war shows us the best version of Thor, Strange and Especially Iron Man still missing his presence in future mcu movies. If I would be the ceo of mcu then I will definitly get him back thru any way on Avenger 4!

Man 2018 was a good year for me

I like the shot of Thor at <a href="">1:10</a> very powerful shot of him.

Til this day I’m still mad that they didn’t use the scene from the thumbnail

This trailer still gives me goosebumps ️
Went through my liked video list. This was the very first vid I liked and it felt so long ago. The hype was worth it for the fans.

<a href="">1:28</a>

best mcu movie
Why did Thanos daughter die all you people in the movie business àre wicked and  miserable never like happy ending

Man, the hype for both Infinity War &amp; Endgame was such a gem to experience. I wish it was like this with the newer marvel shows &amp; movies

I miss how much I was hyped for this movie

im from 2023

Brings back the memories of 2019, I wish I could go back.

This Is My First Ever Avengers Movie That I Watched ,Then I Started Watching  All  Parts Of Avengers Movies And Now I Become Fan Of This Frenchies..

Anyone here in 2022

Whenever I watch these two trialers , it always give me goosebumps

Someone understood why Vision been one f the most powerful avengers in infinity war is like a puppy in the all movie? 

Yo this movie and trailer was insane! just imagine how  Avengers the kang dynasy trailer will be!

The amount of sheer hype and excitement for this film were unreal and my God did it live up to it

Just had to revisit just to see black panther suit up at <a href="">1:30</a> .... Chillls everytime

I find it hilarious that every alien from outer space can speak english

<a href="">1:46</a> they edited the gauntlet to remove some of the stones to prevent the trailer from becoming a spoiler. At that point, he was only missing one stone.

Wow it&#39;s 4 years ago

Better then Endgame

Secret wars and kang gonna be the same hype

Ever fvrt movie
Oh we’re using our made up name then I’m SPINER man

Thanos

Marvel ki best movie
When Cap held thanos’ hand..You not only admire his strength But also see how strong Thanos is because a super soldier struggles to hold his one hand back

Marvel's best movie
Movie was p meh

Anyone from halfway of 2022?

Can&#39;t wait to see it!!!!!

4 years

best saga was finished with this movie

After 3 years 

Seeing this and imaging The Kang Dynasty trailer and or Secret wars trailer gives me chills

Woahh!! A New trailer just drop

Fun fact - Bruce never became hulk in infinity war but was shown in trailer This is how a trailer should be made that made Phase 3 and infinity saga the best phase in history of MCU

Can't wait
4 years later

I can’t wait for this to release !!

Wait, why I am here?

CGI in this movie was absolutely amazing

Can’t wait for Kang Dynasty

Absolute banger of a trailer! Still even after seeing the movie multiple times. It still makes me want to see it.

The YouTube algorithm brought me where I was happy
what a shitty movie

This is and will be the best mcu film ever. After 4 years this is still gives me goosebumps.

If you remember the hype around this movie your a living legend 

¿Any one in 2022? 

I&#39;m from Brazil here 2022 Caraí nostalgia reever this trailer there I shivered the same way as when the movie came out

4 years already……

1559 days ago I feel old!37,416 hours, 2,244,960 minutes and 134,697,600 seconds. WISH WE COULD GO BACK!

Just imagining when Internet breaks after the release of AVENGERS: Kang Dynasty trailer.

That Bass gets me every time <a href="">1:55</a>-<a href="">2:00</a> “DUM DUM DUMMMM.”

still so amazing that we got to see all these different heroes in different films together. DC catch the hell up

Dr strange: We&#39;re in Kang Dynasty now

Why I am here

By far thr BEST marvel movie. I truly dont believe any other will top what was achieved with the Infinity War

Tell me his name : Thanos literally gives goosebumps

<a href="">1:14</a> to see Thor not holding stormbreaker

muere thanos lol

This movie looks like its gonna be good

This is being recommended to me 4 years later and I’m not mad at all this trailer still gets me hyped. I hope Secret Wars is just as good and hopefully better.

Years later and the goosebumps still rising all over

Super epic Wish i could turn back time to see it again when it first released

YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS DISNEY PLUS LEAKED THE ENTIRE MOIVIE YOU CAN BUY A LEAKED COPY AND YOU CAN FIND LEAK CLIPS ON YOUTUBE

It was a crazy hype for this movie in his old days
I miss you
This trailer is still epic. You know what, I&#39;m gonna watch this again now.

I can still get goosebumps from this trailer in 2022

Nostalgia
It was discovered by you in 2022
Best character thanos

How's the movie? ok?
Endgame was awesome, but Infinity War was peak MCU. Downhill from here

whos here after secret wars announced

man this is the peak mcu we know!! phase 4 is not even near it.

Its 2022, why the f am I watching this..?

God I loved this trailer. Can&#39;t wait to eventually see  the Avengers Kang Dynasty and Avengers Secret Wars trailer.

Being recommended this years later,I feel old because it feels like this movie only came out a few days ago 

Hey we gotta give it to Star Lord we all laughed but it was HIS plan that worked if he didn’t mess it up hitting Thanos 

The trailer is still recommended until now

Watched this in the cinema, haven&#39;t rewatched it since. Nothing comes close to the experience.

Nothing will ever beat Thor landing in wakanda with the guardians! I’ve never seen a theater blow up with such excitement the way it did when he m brought down the hammer and broke the ground with storm breaker! Simpler times!

Remember when Marvel used to release great movies like this?... What happened to them?.

hopefully we get there again

This trailer gives me goosebumps

Even after 4 years this trailer still gives me chills 

Ayo what happened to Youtube... suddenly it has started recommending me all old movies trailer... the oldest being Age of Ultron 

Who got recommendations of this trailer in 2022

POV trying to find a comment from 4 years ago

Remember when people called this garbage. Everyones taking that back and calling what we have now garbage. haha

EXCITED FROM PERU
New Trailer!

Still amazing 
It’s blowing my mind how many recent comments are the top comments. It just goes to show how much love was put into this film and received by us the fans.

The hype from this movie was a once in a lifetime experience.

Im here before Marvel confirm Avengers Secret Wars

Just got recommended to me again today. Nice. Still a great trailer.

What I&#39;d give to watch this film for the first time again.

Anyone here revisiting this masterpiece yet again?

Marvel will find it very hard to create better music than this for their future films

Ahhh yes the golden daays

Nostalgia....oh it&#39;s 2022...
<b>4 Years Ago</b>

Still got goosebumps, can&#39;t believe that this happened 4 years ago

4 years later, I still got this on my recommendation page

4 years, still watching this master piece

The Age of Ultron from 7 years ago popped up in my feed a couple hours ago and now this one from 4 years ago... Definitely getting a sign of something...

From 2022

The allknowing algorithm brought us here after 4 years

Still get goosebumps
Still pretty much my favorite movie

I&#39;m here after avengers secret wars and kang&#39;s dynasty announce

I sure hope Secret Wars is gonna make Infinity War look like Civil War.

will never get tired of watching this

I just got goosebumps from a trailer made 3 yrs ago, even after the fact that I&#39;ve re-watched the movie a lot

New trailer , cant wait to see the movie

Marvel definitely peaked here

Mannn

This one and Endgame is better than Phase 4

I remember my testicals tightening when the movie started

I’m sorry but I miss the days of this type of marvel. Idk recent marvel doesn’t feel the same, this movie was truly peak

So what&#39;s the next Avengers Movie after End Game? 

This trailer is still better then whole phase 5

Let&#39;s see how Kang dynasty and secret wars compete against this

Wait untill you see this one,  everybody dies

Just opened youtube and saw this suggestion and thought they released Avengers The Kang dynasty trailer but end up watching this one still one of the epic movie of all time 

I remembered for endgame i was like uuu what’s gonna happen and excitedBut i recall for this movie i was like turn it to 11 kinda hypeIt’s a better movie for me although endgame has a lot of iconic moments

Still Worthy trailer ️
This movie was peak, best MCU movie imo, I hope The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars will somehow top this and Endgame

That feeling watching for the first time when Cap stops Thanos hand to hand, is unforgettable

Cant believe how many takes were cut or re done in here, the ones they went with in the film are far better tho tbf so they made the right decision

I want to see How Kang the Conqueror will best this .Antman :You dont know who you are messing with .I&#39;m an Avenger.Kang: I&#39;m a conqueror

Bro this was 4 years ago?

This still gives me chills

Great movie. What a shame the Russo brothers have sold out their craft to shill Netflix made for TV movies now.

I still remember where I was when this first came out, incredible. The nostalgia, dude 

Take me back to 2018.
wow new Trailer

Who is here after the announcement of Avengers kang dynasty and secret wars?

I miss this so much The hype was 

Watching infinity war for the first time was unmatchable feeling

Best movie ever️
Dawn of the seven looks better than this

Holy wowzers can’t wait for this epic movie to come out

4 years and still amazing ️

Anyone watching in 2022?

4 years later 
I never understood ‘tears of joy’ until I watched this trailer 4 years ago. It makes me so happy that I can’t help but cry with pleasure and satisfaction I feel so elated at every moment of this trailer!!! The entirety of Marvel Phase 3 was a privilege that I will never forget, thank you to everyone involved in Marvel Phase 3️

The best Avengers movie. Seeing them all come together after civil war was amazing... Then that ending.

Its Sunday, 31 July 2022. 4 years later and the goosebumps I&#39;m getting are the same as the day this trailer released.

There r people who watched this straight without previous Mcu films only Bcos of hype.

After 4 years still one of the best films in history
Brooooo so nostalgic
Why am I getting this trailer in my feed? Is this a secret message or something lol 

What a legacy marvel made

Thank you recommendations 

Still the excitement remains same. 

I am a huge Snyder Verse fan and I came here after Marvel has announced the next sagas for their cinematic run. I really admire Russo brothers for their brilliant handling of such big characters in a single universe. They really managed to keep it all balanced. Infinity War is one of the best from Marvel.Meanwhile WB, is busy antagonising their own fanbase. Typical WB behaviour.

&quot;THIS IS EPIC&quot;NOW and FOREVER

i cant wait for it to come out 

Here i am, almost 4 years later, reliving one of the greatest moments in cinematic history

Watching it at 2022

I got recommended for the trailer after all this time? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Why did this come to my mind just now?
The last good avengers movie we got

Got recommended 31st July ,2022

I bet we ain&#39;t gonna get this much hype in ka ng or secret cause this is so well made and the build up was legit the best

ahh, man... I still know how 5 of my friends and I goes to watch a marvel movie. that time, hype was real.

We can livs the past seeing this epic thing in 2022 August 

<a href="">1:53</a> Imagine This music in Avengers secret war

Is anyone here watching in 2022 

The way Marvel did this was perfect. The new movies after Endgame just don&#39;t have the same feel

This movie still looks way better than any movie that marvel studios has produced for phase 4

who watching the trailer in full 2022

For the peeps watch this from 4 yrs ago they a real one the get the n word pads

Still the best Avengers movies

4 years later and this trailer still gives me goosebumps

That was one hell of a movie man

Was this really 4 years ago?! Jeez time flies

Best hero movie ever made
This is a once in a lifetime

It’s already been 4 years since this amazing film

Infinity War was successful because it built tension and was serious for once. Marvel need to create more high stakes, serious films. Thor Live &amp; Thunder should’ve been that, instead we got a circus on crack cocaine.

Remember leaving the cinema at 3am sad and trying to figure out wtf just happened and what will happen in endgame

He did it.
Infinity War Trailer One was the best, Endgame Trailer Two was the best. Imo. Just the build up of the music and everything was incredible. And the Guardians reveal in Infinity War Trailer 1 was incredible.

If they do it right secret wars will wash both infinity war and endgame

Why am I getting this on my home page now?

this movie and the force awakens were unbeatable in hype

This trailer brought some different level of hype I can’t lie

I don&#39;t think there will ever be a movie that had as much hype as this one and endgame

Got this recommended after 4 years.

4 years ago. We saw one of the greatest hype train of all time.

5 years later, Rick Grimes has finally returned 

Russo Brother made a masterpiece and for once in a life time in MCU.Hope they join again

I got this in the recommendation nowChilla

already 4 years time flies

I see cap holding thanos&#39;s fist and remember what joker told luthor about batman &quot;there is nothing mere about that mortal&quot;

I deadass was in awe after watching this me and the boys watched it at the chabot theatre in castro valley instant classic

i miss you
Great memory 
Marvel at Its Finest
Algorithm recommend me after 4 yr

They really put fake scenes in the trailer 

Goosebumps

After iron man died and captain America left Avengers my interest and excitement in Marvel has left over, we miss them

I can watch this movie infinity times and won&#39;t get bored but endgame somehow somewhere doesn&#39;t give this much level of chillEndgame is masterpiece but still you&#39;ll get bore on certain level

Thanos seems like a glass half full kind of guy.

Wait they showed hulk buster in trailer

Good times.

The gathering of heroes other than the Avengers is truly just a legend.
Peak Marvel.
Geeeeee

I still get chills when I see this trailer

Even after 4 years this trailer gave me goosebumps ️

oh man I can&#39;t wait for this movie to come out

My favourite MCU Movie
this still feels so epic no matter how many times I watch it 

Love the music

Im here in 2022 jul 30

This was the last time the MCU had me crazy excited to see some of their character finally interact. We don&#39;t get that anymore. Now it&#39;s crossovers in everything they do. But seeing Quill talk to Iron Man was such a crazy thing to see.

Can&#39;t wait for this.

That Fuckin&#39; Tony&#39;s Bleeding Edge Armor 

I still remember the hype that this movie created, I hope they can replicate it with Kang dynasty and secret wars
Wish we could all go back and watch this again for the first time

Watching this after such a long time and knowing everything it hits different

If Kang Dynasty can come anywhere near this movie I’d be very impressed. Marvel should get all the credit it deserves.

<a href="">1:50</a> The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.

These are not girl bands for you
These were probably the greatest movie trailers of all time. Endgame was a better movie but it didnt have as good of trailers which honestly made endgame better

Cant wait for this movie to come out

Avengers in my feed 4y laterIve never clicked faster in my life

Ah yes, all the avengers against just a purple guy, wonder what could go wrong, can&#39;t even think whether that purple guy will be spared or not...

OMGGG THE TRAILERS OUT!!! I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!!

I am the comment you are looking for🇧🇷
I miss them all

After 4 year the goosebumbs still continue

Youtube recommend me this Video

subtitles be like ; Tony: Tell me his name again?Gamora: Santos.

Anyone watching this 4 years later

Infinity war &gt;&gt; endgame

I want to wash my memory just to experience this masterpiece one more time 

Peak mcu ️
This trailer was so good I went cinemas to watch this movie and it was the best decision. Usually just waited for superhero movies to get home releases but that atmosphere on opening night was different.

The experience of this movie was once in life.

Now after 3 years it is gonna be this but Kang and Doom

Still goosebumps
HYPEREEEE IS HERE ALL THE TIMEEE

anyone in 2022?

Recommended

When I first saw this trailer , I thought chris Evan may be replaced by any other actor . Bcz it&#39;s was totally unrecognizable with his beard . Bt he looks awesome with this Look 

Trust me, this is the best MCU movie till now. I hope Black Panther 2 will surpass it.

Bro, The Avengers are just gonna beat Thanos. I bet Thor is gonna kill him. Probably go for his head.

this was on my recommended

One of the best movies to ever be made.

Secret Wars is gonna blow the hype of this movie out of the water

Still fresh
Will the Multiverse saga finale be as big as the Infinity saga?

Avergers Secret War 2025

I still can&#39;t believe this movie didn&#39;t pulled me into the theater....last movie I saw on the big screen was........ DISTRICT 9...... ......

Imagine when Kang Dinasty and Secret Wars come out

The best 
Peak MCU, I doubt that Kang Dynasty or Secret wars can live up to the hype and storytelling.

I really don’t think they can beat this and endgame we’ll just have to wait and see

i remember all my family social circles just did a standstill in all our personal lives, just to watch this movie. what a good time to be alive.

No way! cant wait for this to come out!

The fact that this was 4 years ago  plus seeing the phase 5 coming this 2023 and the phase 6 with Avengers:Kang dynasty and secret war  give me chills

Marvel fix your mess man. What are you guys even doing now. Dialogues, CGI, Story, all over the place. Geez, people want movies too, not just too many goddamn shows.

Ah... simpler times...
now we wait for avengers  kang dunasy and secret wars!

We can never have another Avengers movie like this one. Period. The end. Over and out.

hi 
If infinity war and endgame had such a hype, just imagine, imagine how much hyped secret wars would be.

They made money with this and now they are just cashing in on our emotions

only if Dr Strange told us how bad MCU would get 

2018-Infinity war2019-endgame2021-no way home2025-secret wars,Kang dynasty

YouTube recommend really brought this back. I’m not mad at though

This was the only underdog marvel movie ever

This trailer never Gona lade

bro it’s 2022 and i just got so excited

Greatest movie of ALL TIME.

Why is this in my recommended in 2022

This movie came in india on 27 April 2018 and I lost my mother on 30th April 2018 and in my case HIV virus was Thanos for us

Still watching on 2022 

<a href="">1:50</a> still gives the chills!

marvel aint gonna make a movie as good as this and endgame for a long time

Avengers Secret Wars brought me here

This phase hits no 1

All downhill since
why did i get this on my recommendation page just now.. is marvel telling us something 

Ahh yes the once in a lifetime experience, it’s a shame that marvel didn’t stop making movies after endgame cause everything after that is dumpster fire garbage They should have just ended it on a high after the climactic buildup of 10 years

This just appeared on my recommendations after the recent  announcement of phase 5 and 6 

Thanos is a kid wait for KANGs..He is different because he has killed all Avengers infinite amount of times

Man i wanna live that moment again

Back when marvel movies were good

Avengers:infinite war4 years ago  Avengers:Endgame 3 years ago

This is one of the best trailers in my option, never been hyped about a movie like this one before!

Why am I still shaking while watching this?

The best director ruso brothers

After the recent project announcements . Wow

When you realize cap and iron man are still on different teams for the entirety of IW and never met till end game

The tubnail said new trailer, but it writes 5 years

Better than Endgame in my opinion

man this was something else.

Best movie argue with the wall

THIS WAS 4YRS AGO
infinity war hype will never be topped

Secret wars better have this much hype

Why was this recommended to me 4 years later idk but hey the movie just,just amazing for me besides no way home it’s no 1 for my movie list and that’s due plot and also my sister spoiled endgame before i saw it

Anyone relieving old memories in 2022?

Wow a new movie?! When does this come out! Wait, cap and iron man died! 

the hype for this was real af imagine phase 6 hype

Who is watching still 2023

Who’s here after comic con and learning about two avengers movie in 2025

cant wait to watch this movie!!! im so excited

Lmaoo I remember watching those trailer breakdown videos I&#39;m miss that eraa

I feel sorry for Secret Wars, having to go up against this.

The hype Was unreal

Infinity war is the best theatrical experience I&#39;ve ever had

THIS WAS ALMOST 5 YEARS AGO NOW WERE GETTING KANG DYNASTY AND SECRET WARS

<a href="">1:11</a> this scene should have been in the movie

Hey i am from 2022..still remembering 2018 scenarios ...of darkish looks of thanos

Just here to revisit the memories after Avengers 5,6 got announced. Still no movie can break the hype like Infinity War &amp; Endgame. Missing RDJ, Chris Evans, ScarJo &amp; Chadwick so much 

I wish I had a time machine ️
This is the greatest movie that Marvel ever made.

English cc at <a href="">0:26</a> got me dying lol“Tell me his name again”“SANTOS”
Hulk

Sheesh

After Avengers eng game Here come Avengers kang bynastyAnd Avengers secret wars

4 years and it’s still fire

Wooom, can&#39;t believe this was 4 years ago

Once lifetime movies Russo brothers

Life time movie 
Hello

Who decided to watch in 2022?
its been 4 years and this movie is still one of the best mcu films if not the best

It looks magnificent even now️‍
Best avenger movie I remember the hype man I remember waiting in 2017 for this movie to come out I remember Thor scene still gives me chills to this day

my fav avenger movie, right up there with winter soldier as my fav marvel movie

i miss tony stark and chadwick

Who&#39;s here after the announcements of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars?

Oh Man! This stuff just got real, I can&#39;t wait till tickets come on sale,I&#39;m taking my whole family.

Omg

Who&#39;s watch this tellers in 2022

I want go back at this time 

Just imagine what they could do with Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars trailers. I honestly cannot wait for another Avengers film with all the new characters and new experiences. Avengers trailers always have the best orchestras and everything in it. Bring it on Phase 5 and 6 we are all here for it!

Is it me or everyone got recommended ️

OMG I can&#39;t wait to see thi.... Oh yeah

People like dc fans like to hate on marvel but they can’t deny everything before phase 4 and after mid phase 2 were some of the best movies. And movies like secret wars, kang dynasty guardians 3 and ant man seem like where the new phase returns to the greatness of the old films.

Wish I could turn back time

steel gate goosebumps 2022

Who&#39;s rewatching this in 2022 and still get goosebumps?
