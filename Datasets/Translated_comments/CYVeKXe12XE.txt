So ugly! Taste is something that you cannot buy, no matter how much money you have.

Looks like dungeon...
but you literally just show one room LOL

Do my home when I buy one thku❤❤

Yeah, almost dark and dingy in the name of cozy and still doesn&#39;t feel like a cozy home.

Terribly BORING

SRK and Kajol is best

That’s it?

Who makes this interior decorator?

Butterflies??? Like preserved!!! Fuck!

Such A Beautiful Room Decorations  And Other Home Accessories Collection  Watching From Bangladesh ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Why do they have such videos in YouTube? Who cares what&#39;s inside their home? They make crores of money and have a home in every part of the world. What are they doing for the homeless people in India? How much of those crores do they spend on charity?

thats insane, the original negatives to Scarface?!?!? damnnn

Chor be like: After watching this video, you will find the blueprint of the house and you will be fine.
Now i agree that money can make you anything like she is not beautiful at all in past but look at now money make her beautiful... beauty&#39;s without money is nothing 😂

It&#39;s so depressing no sunlight nothing natural😮
Shes mentally ill that she collected dead butterflies... killed them to decorate her home... mentally sick.. thats how she does interior design omg... and secondly there&#39;s no  light in the home ,dont wanna say but shes kinda scary like vampires hate sunlight

It looks like an exhibition site 😮😂

Where is full of memories, the wall has hardly 5 to 6 memories only

Becharin actors wives…sari omer in k shohr dosri aurton k peechy bhagty rehti hn or yh on se apny husbands ka peecha churany k leiy hlkaan hoti rehti hn…poor celebraties🤨🤨
All gauri khan homes are so soulless

how much importance she give to her children opinion, Even though they are bad

Light to challu kr dia kro

Sad-looking place

Protect your language my indian friends. Great love from Azerbaijan ❤🇦🇿

House visit or  visit of three walls 😅.  Kanjoos gauri

So dark
BEHIND EVERY LUXURY LIFE THERE&#39;S ALWAYS ALOT OF PAIN, STRUGGLE, EFFORT AND LOTS OF HARDWORK

I always see darkness in celebrities less light 😂🙄🤔

It&#39;s Mumbai, Gauri Khan not Bombay.
Sorry but couldn’t find anything interesting

Perfect for next conjuring or annabelle

Can you make video in Hindi. I understand that there is so much problem in people coming from Hindi, brother, for your information, we are Indians or our language is Hindi.

Lol 😂🤣wat a home tour

Memories and collectibles....blah blah blah... Memories and collectibles... Blah blah blah.... memories and collectibles... blah blah blah 😂😂😂 she has hell lot of money traveling all over the world still don&#39;t know how to speak about her work how to present her work... She knows her only achievement is that she is srk wife and that&#39;s why in all her interview all she talks about is shahrukh

A home is supposed to look lived in, not like a museum 😮

worst piece ws all the dead butterflies. SICK people

Nice

The BLACK HOME ! But ❤️ For ShahRukh Khans family .

Muslim's house is like this, if every dirty drop is scattered, neither God nor Tulsi house will look like this.
I love the memory wall. That’s not just decor it’s a mom’s love. Her children will always remember that she did that for them.

Gaurikhankiss, you
I did not see home, i only saw shhittt framed on walls haha

Inspiration

Jai shree sita ram 😊😊
Giving me those scary vibes

So cringe ....
Bakvass 😂

Ma'am, stick a heroin powder on our wall too, it will be complete 🤭
Her in-laws never approved of her.

Swades was the best movie India have made so far. It was way ahead of his time. Altough, i have watched it first day first show and I have watched it 15, 20 times so far. But, it got flop kind of on box office.

I just want everyone should watch Swades. So, that they understand India more better and many other things as well.

People commenting about how this house is so dark and no natural sunlight is not available, are fawning over Sri Devi&#39;s Chennai house which is almost the same

Copied from Wiz khalifa house tour lol🤣🤣🤣

My Claustrophobia could never . Consider living there with no normal LED white lights instead using yellow bulbs . I think they forget to add the natural light from the Sun part .

Where are the windows, Khan Sahiba?
there are so many gold details in their house there is no daylight and it doesn&#39;t look useful

Hindu in the khan 🤣
You can&#39;t be a hindu

You must see Paathaan movie...😀
Camera man is not good v bad Camera making

Teaser..

Gauriji, whether you are a Hindu or a Muslim….it is bad that I asked you like this.
Shahrukh Khan&#39;s extravagant lifestyle is not just about the glitz and glamour, but also about his philanthropic efforts and humble beginnings.👍

@gauri khan , savings, conservation, carefulness, memories, beautifulness are jewel of your maam

Ok cool

𝒟𝒶𝒶𝒾𝒾𝒾
It looks like arundhati bungalow no natural light
A worst house tour 😏😏

Small things meant a lot to mothers.

Gauri ji, the more you help others, the happier you will be.
Gauri ji, you have so much money, your life does not seem boring, you must be staying in a corner, in some room near the door, ma'am. We also need some money, how do we want to earn money, we want to earn money, meaning we want to be self dependent, your house is very beautiful, we want to clean it and look beautiful.
house look so dull... nothing unique

what about the sun light ?

Very good home. Congratulations Gauri Khan. - Kishor

The day you chewed on your way, you didn't feel that you were eating the dick of a naked woman.
wall of memories but only 10 memories are presented on the wall

Plzz sb pray to remember Allah for my lovely day...😢ameen
superb.

comments are more interesting than the house itself man🤣😂

No one home like suneel shetty home...omg nature

it is so dark and dull, gloomy

Natural light makes home more beautiful even if it is simpler one. Dark and gloomy walls with fancy lights make it more like hotel which in long run may cause depression.

What a shame! Janhvi Kapoor did a better job showing her Chennai home.

That looks so dead.. No natural light.. It looks so warm, ill.. Not trying to be rude.. Just saying what I feel.. I would suffocate in that house..

the way she talks she seems nervous and doesn&#39;t have much confidence.

I like refreshing and cool place. It&#39;s luxury and dark. No sunshine. 👎🏻

So dark and please rename the title to Gauri&#39;s Delhi wall.

So dark
Gauri mam very beautiful house iam fan shahrukh sir our beloved super star sharukh sir god 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 bless yours familys

We didn’t see anything!?

With all they have, you think they&#39;d be happier. But the more she spoke, the sadder I felt. So was trying so hard to hold back the past, as if the present did not fit her plans or the plans of the house she had built. The wall stood for that. The more we hide, the more we end up telling.

She is an interior designer . I expect better.

Where is this house located in Delhi

The framed makeup brushes shock me. Like whyyyy

Barely saw the house…. What kind of a tour was thus???

2 mins jus for the wall.. 🤦‍♀️
Nothing new or special seemed to me in this.
Dumbest concept

The last thing. That memory wall. Why you are faking baby . 😂😂 Literally..  no one in now days so dumb that can&#39;t understand difference between memory OR well designed by purpose decorative wall.. there is huge difference.. 😂😂 and that makeup brush. 🤣🤣

Very cute

No natural light at all ..feels vampirism,clubbing,ambience is set to get drunk and high .. Home speaks a lot even without she saying anything... no joke being a superstars wife ..must be High pressure for sure. ..I really hope she finds her own alley to be successful and confident in life . Interior design is definitely not her lane though

Love her

We ❤ you ShahRukh🕺👑📽🎥
Common insan Marr raha hy bas

NO LIGHT. YUCK!TOXIC HOME AND TOXIC COUPLE ☯️🙏🧿
Just one word for this video... Bakwaas

special toys

King&#39;s house

How did they become so famous?

&quot;Wall full of memories&quot; &amp; &quot;her all the make-up brushes&quot; is with two brushes! Seriously!? There was so much to show other than just shooting her &#39;all two brushes&#39; over &amp; over.

Disgusting home

It&#39;s better and easier to sit under a tree and watch the clouds

Waste of internet🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely gorgeous and well decorated. I love it. Dim light and dark colors

nice but ....

shd i say something?!

Dark and shady ✌️

This video is proof that money can&#39;t buy class!

I think her massi lived in Ipoh, Malaysia

This house will increase my anxiety to next level. It&#39;s so intimidating and suffocating to even see.

Vogue india should learn to match the video and title... Scam😂🤣

Thank you for sharing this!  Absolutely amazing

Design a house in a small budget , and that too beautiful this can be done easily by anyone.

Moti Bhakts are crying as usual

Beautiful....Home mam 🥰🥰👌
Very beautiful
U forget to hang an album of drug as this is your son&#39;s favorite.

imagine their wall if some guy rejects suhana&#39;s love proposel ☠️☠️

Bad log... karte honge like this
Looks like bhoot bungalow
she love butterfly wow what is this????? she hates it that is why kill it and frame it😭😡i do not understand the logic of rich ppl 😩😩😩😩

Looks like shit

After Aryan&#39;s case she had sobered down.....now she is everywhere.....mat uro.....be humble.....she is famous coz her husband is...I don&#39;t think she would be where she is  if not coz of Shahrukh

Very artificial

Why kill the butterflies!!!

Madam Mumbai said not Bombay.
Copy from vogue global 🤓

Aryan gave a pot of Ganja in place of Racket.
Amazing
Sharukh is a luckiest and richest man in the world because he has a most privileged, respectful and strong wife like gauri,who organized himself and stand by him in every thick and thin of life.

Bhhht fazool house hai aur ye wall is mai kuch b memorable nhi lg tha suhana ka brush aur fzool chezy

she has no talent  for house design

some people do realise that the house wasn&#39;t shown completely, only certain places were shot for privacy reasons and just to highlight some important memorials they have in their house. It was probably shot at night, set a different lighting to make it look more cinematic and camera pleasing. It could be an aesthetic for all we know. Also the family doesn&#39;t live there, it&#39;s more of a collectible hence why every corner has antique furniture, delicate pieces and artwork and many memories which many people won&#39;t have inside their house to preserve them. Honestly the house looks beautiful, dark academia is a well known aesthetic and many people love it

Woo kya naseeb hi Allaha our daaa ameen
The house that has been destroyed for one day has to be decorated… I wish we could reach our end soon..

Middle class house in bengaluru has better interior design than what she has...

Memory wall is a joke I thought it would be full or pictures of the kids and her and srks but is she really an interior designer cause this home is totally horrible her bombay home looks less of a home more of a museum suhana would-be embarrassed that her has frame a make up brush and hand mirror in a frame 5 frames totally pathetic

Invest Memories Not Things

Nice

King of MANNAT movie hai i live in KOLKATA

No natural light ! No plant ! No natural air ! You people are living in 7 star jail ! With lot of money and fame ! But without freedom and enjoyment!

It&#39;s so dark, even Klaus mikaelson will cry for 🌞 sun.

Seraj hi and ok
House not home

I didn’t like the decor at all

are you going to start eating?
Wall full of memories
Have some drug painting on the wall, it&#39;s a long lasting memory as we all know 😂.

Too depressing home ☹️
May be shoot in night so no sun light

She is lucky

Yeah Butterflies.  Actual butter morphed as a flying buggy this is actually understanding not any comprehension .   They are able to distinguish more in Ethics than us has Americans.

I cant understand why there are so many negative comments we havent even seen the whole house, I think its a great Idea to put your childrens favourite toys when they were young, who else would have thought about that?

She deserve Shahrukh khan

Good wife And hubby

What a dark home. Wheres the natural light?

Gauri Shah Khan
What so ever but gauri is looking smart n well dressed here

It&#39;s just amazing mam and biggest fan of srk sir

Good house with great family

Gauri khan proves that money can not buy taste.

The wall full of memories Two rackets here and there one brushButterflies 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 kaha se kiya hai mam INterior design

Actually it’s a dark place It should have a nature and Indian touch to it

What is the benefit? There are so many big houses and no happiness. Home is not called problem. Wherever you live, you are happy. There is no house where there is pride in money.
I love saharukh khan sir ❤️❤️👌👌
Bekar

Not gonna lie.... I expected much better.

Michael Jackson&#39;s home and Neverland is the wealthiest home I have ever seen

Boring

Before this i was not knowing that butterflies can be framed on wall as memories 🤣

Bombay is more cool then Mumbai. Mumbai not even a good name. I think Bombay name should be given back to it.

Not Bombay it&#39;s mumbai😂 jahil
No offence but she seemed really cold.  Just showing walls and 2 lamps.

The only mansion that has no toilet, no bedrooms and no kitchen

The inside house tour which we did not know.... we never needed...

KIND OF DARK , GAURI. SOME WHAT DEPRESSING TOO. SORRY. SRK &amp; GAURI.RAFI Maine USA

Wr is house ? I can only c walls only walls

I want a house tour like Sunil Shetty did for his house, amazing home and amazing tour

Beautiful

No pooja room?
Rich people are so boring..eee..cant even sit and talk to them extreme classy environmnt no place for fun.

Wwooww..butterflies in frame.... What kind of art is that???!!! I hate this kind of things.. But it&#39;s OK... Their choices.. But still that&#39;s not kind..

I have two older brothers, my middle older brother was or is a big fan of actor Al Pacino&#39;s movies since The Pate / The &quot;Godfather&quot;, Scarface probably too. I guess, he likes story mafia films.

Show us their toilet.

Yeh toe Mumbai wala mannat hain naa

Loved the place!

Haunted house 🏠👽👽😈👿👹👺
all the money they have, they have absolutely no taste... it&#39;s all interior decorator&#39;s work! let&#39;s be honest here @vogueindia

Below comment is right... Wat architecture... Not a single window for natural air.... How...

😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘more beautiful

Museum.. 😂
the wall of memories is the lamest thing i have seen and heard

I&#39;m sorry but why do a home tour if you aren&#39;t going to show anything but 3 walls?

Rich people tend to hate sunlight even for their houses. That make them artificial. What&#39;s the point of living a human life if your ultimate aim is to be and do unlike humans  are and do.

Those are dead butterflies... framed? 🤔
samajh nahi araha kaun si gali dun
i am sure there&#39;s more area for sunlight and nature, it&#39;s just a few section of the entire mansion!

It's such a big house; and there is no one left
Where is Hooka and drugs room.

Who made her interior designer

&quot;wall full of memories&quot; ahhhh I count 6 but suree

How many crazy people hhh..ufff...
Haunted places

It&#39;s so boring and dark, negativity, dumb appearances, no freshness,  vibrancy brightness in the house, no green, natural touch....i got depressed after looking at the interiors.

India specially indiaRich getting richerPoor gets poorerOverall fake politics currptYou can&#39;t take when u die 🙏Simple life simple living thing ❤️

You can also use your mother tongue. Indians are considered white because we don't respect ourselves. Europeans say, go to the world. English is the only language. Use it, but forgetting your mother tongue for status everywhere is a shame. Brother, you are cursed. on national level
Not any interesting items on the wall.

Looks horrible
When God gives beauty, he is born.
Sorry, but it&#39;s quite gaudy...not a soft touch anywhere.

Great! Well, But I love my 3 BHK, full of loved ones and memories. What makes home lovely, is the people NOT walls..

Everyone who has access to the internet is a designer... If you don&#39;t believe it, just put in some money and ask them to design your house interior...

What is this? Brother called me to see the house and he just gave a speech on one wall and went away!
Proud to be muslimah AlhumdulillAH

The butterfly was kinda creepy

Did you guys shoot this at night? The house is lighted like a pub.

Shitty video. Butterflies being killed and framed just for fun..who does that? I mean we love srk and all..but then there&#39;s that! Not good at all.

Where are you sucking the real food?
I guess, Teddy bears, unicorns are not &quot;Gwory&quot; enough, dead butterflies are the way to go ..

I came here to see the house …still waiting. What a waste of time.

Beautiful

I was searching Aryan&#39;s Powder On Memory wall from the cruise 😅 Am I only one 🤔

Hands down the worst home tour. She&#39;s got no taste, many other actors have gorgeous homes and this just looks pretentious.

This is my courtyard to be born in. It is with us that we share the table with each other.
This is the thing I was looking for in the last video, after watching it I found out that this house is in India.
&quot;She and her husband has so much money that even after buying the premium artifact&#39;s,furniture and photos it still seems unpleasant to them&quot;

Sunlight?

Ameer logonka ghar hamesha perfect rakna pasand karthe hai shyad...hamare ghar mai tho saman Tatar patar rehthe hai 😀😂hamare ghar ke wall pe ek sir ka oil stain ya phir cooking oil stain rehtha hai..aur rackets sabi kelthe waqt zamin ko lagakar khel ke kabaadi ko bech he rehthe hai😀. .fav movies ya pic  1TB harddidk bhi kam padtha...rug tho sirf mehman ko dikane keliye nikalthe hai😀

I would suggest vogue that instead of showing the glamorous house of stars... You can also show people the houses these big stars lived before getting the fame and how they&#39;re connected with their old life. It&#39;s my personal view but that would be more Interesting to see.

Where is the home tour??

when did she show her complete house ?

Just one wall, a staircase and few frames, all imported from West. Nothing India, what a waste seeing this video....

People in the comments are so bitter lol? Why is everyone so bothered by other peoples home

I can’t breathe
Dark..!!!!!!!

Versace mirror…..seen a lot in mostly LA mansions

Mastttt Home 🏘️😊
you call it a home. no home vibes.

We were not here to see walls 😒

Not many things on the wall of memories - energy comes off as emptiness

Every jobless housewife thinks they are professional interior designers. They just splurge their husbands money for timepass

😍 Amazing house
Guess she lives on her walls,reptile

Show off only,

Horrible house

First lady

What was the meaning of this clip (video)? 🤣

Very very nice

Moody and nice. It&#39;s someone&#39;s home not an art or country exhibition so doesn&#39;t have to make sense to all or have pieces representing a country. And most people complaining about lack of sunlight, I&#39;m amused that they think this the entire home and there must not be sunlight anywhere. Even if that was the case, it&#39;s their home, sunlight or none of it, what art, what colour, they decide and nobody else has a say. Such an obvious thing needs to be stated...

Every one criticizing the house 😁😁😁😁angur khate h Dark dark dark night shoot hAur raat m ☀️ nh ate
Nice  house

Are there any windows?? Do not they have ventilation problems?

Honestly people don’t care. Especially people dying from starvation and having home. They show their lifestyle. 😡

A separate palace has been built to cherish the memories. 😀

The title of the Video should be &quot;Gauri &amp; Her 3 Walls &quot;😂😂looks scary btw

I like the house but it&#39;s a bit dim lit.

Head without brain.

This is something called luck, it was just bazigar or deewana to bring her husband up. 😂. Not every lover become superstar 🤔😉.😂😂😂. Deewana ki deewani

That&#39;s why Aryan started taking drugs due to depressed home

What a mess this video clip was…. Nothing genuine.

So so funny comments im really enjoying reading it gauri put more videos and be a part of ridiculoua comments 😂😂😂

Weird wall of memories...dull lighting, no natural light...i guess I&#39;ve styled my Bungalow way better

The host looks like a ghost herself

haram kay pasey sey bana ghar . lanat ho tum sab per#
I will not be surprised if there’s a secret dungeon with slave kids in that house. What a weird looking place.

She showed just the two walls of her house...

There is such a special person in the house that he will suffer from depression.
How did she become a interior designer, nothing tasteful ,artistic or creative here. It’s just her collection on the wall , expect the mirror . And rest is quite boring!!

I taught to be an interior designer you need skill.... But after seeing her I realize that you should be a celebrity wife.... So ppl give you work even with zero skill.... That&#39;s our condition

Yuck being an SRK home!
Everything  is  so fake screaming  silently of opulence  and suffocation

Show where your son hides ganja

Just like bhoot bunglow 😂😂

Everything seems so superficial for some reason!! 🙁

Great ideas ❤️✨✨
Debleenasinha India World best designed house by World best designer Gaurikhan.Its a lovely house with lovely memories.Thank YouTube for recommend of wonderful videos.

Beautiful house

All brown and grey.... very little light.... it is no doubt a luxurious beautiful rich home. But not everyone&#39;s style.

Love this ❤️❤️gauri is amazing woman she is the best and an amazing designer ❤️❤️this family will always have my heart srk king ❤️😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️suhana aryan❤️❤️❤️abraham❤️😍🥰🥰😘💛❤️❤️❤️
in this depressed generation everybody wants a cozy, comfy house....❤️

But memories of Aryans drug are missing

The haunted house 🏡🏠

Which part of the walls has been sponsored by that  &#39; guthka&#39; company??

It&#39;s dark ...needs some air n light

Atleast she wasn&#39;t a gold digger..she has been with shahrukh when he was nothing until now..moral of story never marry someone who is already looking for someone already settled because she will never be by your side in your tough times..

Where is credit card on the wall of memory

Still better than Sussanne khans museum

Thanks You God Father for all beloveds at eternity and than never fault You ! Every details from LOVE must come from You! 🤗🌈🤣💌✨🎊💗🥳😜🍼💞💘🥲😇🥰👼😍😘
She is mostly into drugs and that&#39;s the reason she speaks like a school girl Watch her carefully. 😂😂😂.. She couldn&#39;t grow further, poor articulation.  No skills, forgetful. Can&#39;t even describe her house properly.

They didn&#39;t show any part of the house

Dudee the comment section is more interesting than the video itself 😂 I&#39;ve been reading these for ig an hour now lol

Best home. &amp; good interior

I didn’t see any part of home

how she is talking English hahahaha English accent like Indian pure ahhahaha the lovely Accent hahahahahhahahahahah

Poor interior taste not good to see tasteless woman..... waste of money..... look like a bunk house which not having natural..... lights and air

GUTTER🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
oh wall wall wall. Ok i seen this.Now would u please show me your house 😑

Dead butterflies .. good memories 😭

The biggest homes are dark and empty. Being happy with less is what makes a great human being, not a big house with marble floors, or everyone knowing who you are.

Who cares where the bloody hell you live in. How can SRK make his accommodation in grave after his death, if he claim himself a Muslim? Or his dead body will be burnt after his death like a Hindu? He is such an influential celebrity who claims himself as a Muslim, but is doing nothing for those Muslim victims who are being oppressed by Hindu extremist government, their anti-Muslim and Islamophobic disciples and racist supporters. Some prominent actors like Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher are blatantly supporting this culprit Modi’s atrocities. Kangana Ranaut is another racist bitch. This is the biggest conspiracy against Islam and Muslims in India in this century. But these conspirers will not succeed and I believe the triumph of Islam is certain and one day Muslims will rule the whole India Insha Allah.

Correction requiredNot Gauri khan&#39;s House tour it isWall tour😂🙄

Those butterflies better not be real dead butterflies...  Humans should learn to teach their dumbass kids to respect other living beings on earth!  Enjoy the next deadliest disease...see if you can save yourself from that...

Watch ronaldo&#39;s house it&#39;s amazing guys

What special do you see in this chutiye Sharukh cartoon?
what the joke was this

Where are windows,  balcony , terrace or anything like that ?

Home tour? Exhausted from seeing 3 walls. She has 2 homes while some people barely have one

The thing I hated is that they decorated butterflies on the wall literally gauri khan sucks and the way she talks it was looking she has a lot of attitude

So boring

Isey acha toh mere 1RK hai. Natural light or 100 percent spirituality

<a href="">1:54</a> white powder pudiya bhi chipka dete toh aur maza ata

Fill your house with useless furniture of strange shapes, you can dress yourself as an Indian interior designer.
Actually, this Delhi home of Shahrukh Khan has really been built from the heart...
If natural ventilation is not provide in the house , m not gonna to glorify or cherish it anyway....poor planning, poor concept

Logic of this videoWalls makes home, so showing walls =home tour

Exact location in Delhi?

Thank your luck that you got married to SRK… I am not as hopeless as the glass of coke I drink while living with someone in Delhi…🤣🤣🤣
2.10 wall s sure creepy .. but thnx for Sharin

Where Is House

<a href="">2:24</a> mom should place your son&#39;s ecstasy for your remembrances 😆

My 200sq ft house is more clean and brighter than hers..

Wow just osm

Nice conceptual walls

Is she killed butterfly and put it into box

GAURI: Hello!SRK: Vogue humara ghar dekhenge. Show them just antiques, 1RK room. Don&#39;t show complete 5 storage big building👏👏👏👏👏

Such a waste of time!

Greatsuper power reel real couple

Make up brushes cracked me up

YOPT! Scary Botox madam. 👎👎👎
I feel like I should be paying to see this.

Actually it&#39;s so easy to become an interior designer when have lot&#39;s of money... 😜🤣

A completely beautiful house would not be very dark, a dark color would not be thought of at all, the day would be dark, the setting would be dark, no decoration would be thought or a favorite wall would also be someone's 🤣
Hmmm

Come on. Si
Home tour or wall tour? 😂😂

Just LOL

Lovely home and yor relationship 🥰

So basically BS

House is empty nobody stays there in Delhi make no sense of glamour house without people .we can say just musium.they have build many house apart from this just for their personal space when they visit to perticular city offenly even at abroad.very rich family hope they have big family one day 🙂

This house is more depressing and dark than mine 🌑

depressing house

So beautiful

Damnnnnnnn....sooo dull, dark lights😐....
Suhana did makeup, so we framed her makeup brushes and comb? like seriously. why do people messup so much in the name of art and creativity. I love cleaning, so I will frame my broomstick and wipe cloth? gosh!!!! hahaha.

It&#39;s hilarious 😂😂😂 showing wall n title home tour 🧐🤨🙄🤔🙀🙀🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Why I feel like she had nothing to talk about. Nd she was making up random stories 😅

Would love to see other walls of your other family members....

Hi everyone

It&#39;s not home tour it&#39;s called wall tour

Very disappointed home tour . It&#39;s better not to show this kind of videos.

How many BHK are there and which floor is it? ,
The world's most beautiful paradise
Purani Haveli part 2😂
&quot; antique rug used as a piece of art&quot;... agle room me srk ki purani chaddi tangi milegi &#39; as  piece  of art&#39;...

MashaAllah we are hungry ❤
Foolish people don't wake up from silence so many people, how to earn money, why don't you ask them?
Looks more like a museum. suhanas makeup brush.. badminton rackets in which they used to play... its not home..

The fake accent cringe😶😶She&#39;s trying too hard

Looks like adams family house

Why is it so dark?

New conjuring will be shot here

Meusium

May be they don&#39;t want to reveal everything,what ix the problem yar?? Fool people are overloaded  in comment section.

Come to Islam.Otherwise non Muslims go to hell after their death remain or stay in hell always or forever alas.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wonderful Home tour I seen so far 😂🥳😆🤣
I am here from shark tank😂

THE WALL IS THE INTERIORS HER DESIGNING ! MEANING

Wrost home tours ever in history

It should have... been Photo frames collection not a house tour 🙄

The wall of memories is such a unique concept! Beautiful!

I know that for the rich people there is a heaven in the world, but for the poor people heaven is also a hell

Is this a joke

Its not a home not getting that home feeling and 😂😂for me its a library that&#39;s it

It is wall not home tour..

going by the comments the tide is turning- people are no longer valorising ostentatious wealth but rather despising it. All I could see was a backdrop of extreme poverty to which people like this are totally insular

He is not positive in the house
I don&#39;t like them at all but I gotta admit that the house is well made

Wall tour

Anyone from shark tank India😅

I don't see any house in my house but I don't know which lovely couple I don't like Shahrukh I like Akshy but as a husband no doubt he is hero
Mam aap jay bhim ho ky

On wall of memories do add aryan&#39;s supplies🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wtf

Kajol's house is bright and glows just like her. And Gauri has a gloomy, cold
There is no soul in such a house
There are no good vibes in the house...it felt so scary I didn't know why...negative energy is there
She is my crush😍

Everyone in her family are designers including money.  😂😂

Seriously, how&#39;s it gonna help the Indian community who live on the streets??

I'm shocked by this wall of memories! Why are there no children’s first drawings, or any things that would remind of a date with Shakrukh Khan?! I was very disappointed in Gauri and... In general, it seems to me that she is an angry, bitchy, overly self-confident woman. Now compare her to Kajol! And what does Shakrukh Khan look like next to Gauri and Kajol!
Gauri is not a good mother

What a dark and gloomy and depressing decor

Issue accha to &#39;small budget big makeover&#39;  ke Ghar hote hain

I have no idea why these celebrities get so much importance, who cares for your stupid paintings from NY LA. These people have zero patriotism for their own country, She will give zero importance to hungry kids and poor people,  but give a glamorous lecture of her stupid walls. Piss off we know where you came from Gori. India is poor because of greed and you people are part of it. And shame on people who are kissing her butt here.

She is so sophisticated and well spoken. No doubt SRK fell for her.

Where does Aryan keep his drugs at home? He woke up and saw nothing.
By speaking Hindi, you can earn money from Hindi films.
Ghar mai thoda cocaine hai kya?

Why do celebrities buy so many houses when eventually they all shift to US or Europe or whatever ......

Guys it’s more like a museum 😂😂😂

Mam give me mail id for sent cv

Most ridiculous home tour! What’s the purpose of showing one wall filled with rubbish!

Fite mun es video on
NYC house... Just three walls... I thought they were living in big house... So small house 🙄

Uncle gave me gold.
I don't like the paint on the walls or the light in the house... Very dull energy is flowing in the house... Bhootiya ghar 🤣🤣🤣
3/4 walls built with drug money 😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆🤣🤣
Ghar m DRUGS kahan rakhte ho??😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

How many houses they have. Why not donate to poor. God would bless them

There are more successful people than Bollywood 😂😂😂😂😂😂 your show is only watched by underprivileged people try to help them not this nonsense

(Only if your from the u.s. you’ll understand what I’m talking about) not insulting but it looks like the houses in New Jersey.

pretty home, ,well walls, but that was one sad memory wall if you ask me. you bet my mom would have my report card from grade 1 framed

@<a href="">1:53</a> she said memory of kids, what they love? She mean drugs?

Only showing three walls.Privacy concerns I guess.  😆 🤣 they knew they would get views on this too as Indians are vele.

This looks like just a house not a &quot;home&quot;

Didn't you use the system?
I Don&#39;t like shis home dizayn 🙄

Haunted house is going on👎
Judgement society will judge . Everyone has right to do anything if she has framed butterflies so people are shouting in comments . No matter they also use to kill hen , cock and many more animal to eat them on that moment they never think about that . Please be sensible and don&#39;t judge anyone .

I thought we can see the house.. But, everything is about wall.. The most confusing is wall of memories.. Maybe portraits of family is never in this category..

Pooja Bedi did an amazing performance acting as gauri.. in masaba masaba

Madam not home  palace , palace
Why everything is so darkkkkkk.... Where is light ???It&#39;s more like a vacation home where you live for 2 days and keep it locked for rest 363 days

What is dark home 🙄🙄
Guys this is Shah Rukh fucking khan&#39;s house, they cannot have a window because then stupid people who unfortunately exist in our society will become spys , spying on them... trying to ruin their privacy 🙄👍

NCB wants to see aryan’s room

no colour no windows and no sunshine ..it&#39;s not a home tour but a sad presentation ..it&#39;s giving off sad energy as though it&#39;s not her home but a carton box packed with things.. it&#39;s just dark and gloomy.

best house for drug users very dark😂😂😂😂

This is aesthetic. I Love it....

Nice hometour😊
I love you 😍
Very very nice 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
This is the house where drugs are smuggled from the world by Aryan.
❤︎❣︎♡︎the way she decorated her home walls was so beautyfull that memories wow i love aryan ....this home so so beaytyfullll❤︎❣︎♥︎
Boycott Bollywood and khan

She is bakwas interior designer isse to wash room bhi design nahi karna chahiye

she is a trophy wife.

I don&#39;t like it

DL villages to ji.
Classless lot......like the rest of Bollywood.

Madam ji, you should have paid some attention to your son also.
Till date Best homes were of SSR..loads of meaninful things around and I liked John Abraham&#39;s duplex home although I don&#39;t like him 🙄🙄🙄But SSR&#39;s house is da best...

Ur kids love&quot; Maal&quot;
Druggies life and der homessss..

Oh yes ARYAN drug lord comes from here!
Glamorous nahi charsi
She has no taste, and don’t know how raise her kids properly

By saying  collectables , art pieces  was she talking about the makeup brushes in those huge frames and the badminton rackets !!? I&#39;m genuinely confused!

Money doesn&#39;t buy you taste , seems to be kinda fitting here.

I watched this video out of curiosity after Aryan Khan’s arrest and release on bail. 



&quot;For Gauri and Shah Rukh Khan both, their home is an emotional abode, surrounded with unusual pieces of art and artifacts, photographs, collectibles and everything&quot;



Darling, best moments are being together, NOT THE MATERIALS, chandelier, some wall hangings, some cloths hanging off a wall, very expensive sofas, you can find great joy even sitting on the floor………. spend time with your children, know where they are going, who their friends are, be there for them when they come home, have meals together...........all the small things that any normal family would do together is what makes memories and is what children need to grow up to be secure, responsible, happy individuals and citizens.

No matter what happened, the son was not taught well
❤ Gauri khan ji...happy Diwali to all of you 🙏
gore

Very beautiful

BORING HOUSE 😑
Are you talking like Gauri or Trump?
Final destination is Grave yard

No wonder why Aryan Khan do drugs 🤣
Where are the windows.....

Arrey you had missed something in this house tour. The cupboards that are stuffed with drugs.😐😐😐

What a combination?? Suhana makeup brush, badminton, butterfly 🤑🤪🤪🤪
Aryan Khan has taken drugs here?
My house is better than you

Don&#39;t show overact need to follow culture and manners for aryan khan arrested by NCB

Let&#39;s frame Aryan&#39;s bail bond and put on that wall 🤣🤣🤣Horrified to see a mom framing dead butterflies in the name of her daughter&#39;s memory! 🥶

They live in mumbai this is not where they love

Ye tum also explain krskti th sb in urdu
Now let&#39;s see what is in aryan Khan&#39;s room

Where are drugs🤣🤣
Most imp thing people forget that  the rich today (most of them) are here after hard work . Please respect that .  Atleast be happy what people have achieved .  Dukh mein dukh kamm khushi mein dukh zyada hai aj kal

Bc Add

Aryan playing badminton in jail now 😂

Be good parents first, what is the use of these comforts if the whole family is a drug addict and someone does not love someone at the same time.
Instead of showing off, give good values ​​to your son🤫🙃➡
Charsi 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pathetic😶
Ye sab to thiq he par kesa ganjedi beta peda kiya 😄I saw old interview of you and your husband 😄😄😄 I shocked 😳😲Now it will be reality 😄😄😄😄
People in this country has become obsessed with trolling and hating on the Privileged people all for no reason at all!!  Stop promoting all this  hate and negativity folks!!  It’s their life and their destiny which they’ve worked and sacrificed for...so let them be!!

Reminded me of The Addams Family How is she an interior designer? Doesn&#39;t have basic sense of ventilation and lighting.

What should I do to save the money and make an appointment to meet my parents?
Is this house is really sharukh Khan house ? OMG according to vastu this house is full of negative energy. Sorry Gauri your interior is too bad.

we are indians ....please used to spoke in hindi

Aaj kal slums mein aise ghar bante hai jaa jaake pehle bacche ki fikar kar

what&#39;s up with all the hate in comment section???.....not one positive comment.

Where are the drugs??
drugs🖤
Wow

Not bolo madam u are Indian
Looks lik a lifeless plc..looks lik a haunted bungalow..no positivity can see in that home

<a href="">2:20</a> Year 2021 October..Now she needs to add more thing in here wall .. read more …….Aryan’s cell phone with WhatsApp 🤪🤪🤪🤪

Bhutiya ghar rehne me dar lage. I hate those type of mirror ..

Hello NCB,i hope you are watching all the hiding spots,that bedroom has a false ceiling🤣🤣

What is the property at home?
Hame to jb tk white light n mile ji hi n paye🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Folks lets be clear here, the first thing she should have said is &quot;Thanks to my husband,&quot; but she didn&#39;t. Here is one ungrateful, deluded woman... can&#39;t swear. Get a grip Gauri!!!? (UK)

NCB be like humko manat isse accha laga😂😂

Doesn&#39;t even look lively, it&#39;s like theque

Andheri west flat
The most boring video ever

Charsis home

Perfect place to get high on ganja and charas.

she&#39;s trying so hard to sound fancy with all those decorations but they just sound dumb lol who tf hangs their make up stuff lmao 😂

Please tell Shawrukh Khan that see Afghan Shawrukh Khan that is in youtube and help him, he is a refugee in Pakistan now and his name is Farhad Khan.

Take care of your daughter first
Cheap content with great advertisement.

Mrs Gauri Khan one more thing Aryan Khan's drugs

Shahrukh khan: kkk... kkk kiran tu meri banjaAryan khan: muze chahiye Ecstasy cocaine charas ganja
Instead of dressing him, the child would have been born without so much trouble. I am sorry for you Gauri. you are a dirty mother
No air holes

So this is how they build their memories in walls😂😂 the whole house doesn&#39;t matter 😅😅What A complete house Tour 👏😂

Expected better

Aryan Khan ....hahahaha ... Srk is a cheater....boycott

So rich.
But she&#39;ll be sad now

How ridiculous… even if it happens in such a big palace, it is not worth showing anything.
Amazing interior 💞
No natural light .. nothing...just blah blah blah....an average middle class woman would decorate her home which wud perhaps look more beautiful than this artificial looking house

Where is place for keeping drugs

drugs wala kamra kaun sa hau aunty hahahaha
Aur jo log hamare mulq me bhuke mar rahe hai unka kya?

Make up kits… the used and thrown product.. the butterflies that got killed.. Aryan used to play badminton before becoming a druggie that’s what it is….New York hoarding all of these over expensive but thrown us adding glam to the house… rediculous

Wtf..memories 😂😂😂

How they live in this dark shit

No natural light.....so horrible
Bhutiya ghar lagraha h
Wow

Charas in ever room for guests 😂🤣😂😂

We, the people of India, are responsible for their shenanigans.

Glamor

Frame Aryan Khan&#39;s favourite drugs too.. 😁

You have beautiful concrete houses but you have a drug addiction son too. You are very poor in my view

All rich people&#39;s homes in India have one thing in common - they all have homeless people sleeping on the streets. The rich folks drive by fast without ever looking at the homeless.

Aryan’s racquets 😜

3You look so beautiful. I want to meet your son, friend

Depressed home

Boycott

Wow I wish I was even half as rich as her 😀

Interior designer who didn&#39;t have time to design a Quality interior of her own Son.She failed to be a good mother

they knows well there children using drugs well---

Bogus post..
Support plz guys
<b>VERY DEAD</b>

What is the use of so much money if your son is still in jail?
What rubbish

cocaine karne wala room konsa hai ?

Rich in money and poor in parenting.

This is not a hoe or house tour just showed some painted walls.

You should frame some doobies and hang on the family wall

The improved their life, their wealth, their house and bought expensive cars but they forgot to mold their son lol. Parenting at its best.

Where is the packets of Aryan&#39;s  favourite drug in this house😂😂also show that 😂

Oo in this house Aryan Khan consumes Drugs😂😂

Mashallah Mrs Khan! You have a beautful  home 🏡  😊👌🏻

This shows money doesn&#39;t buy style

TERRORISM AND DRUG ARE INTEREALTED😤😤🤬🤬 DRUG MARKET PROVIDES BLACK ECONOMY TO TERRORISM😠😠😠
Who does frame combs mirrors 😂😂😂😂😂
Now without Aryan, I have spent some time with your face.
Beautiful home

You must have taught aryan how to do drugs..🤣🤣

Where is Aryan&#39;s favarate drug on the wall?

Looks dark and gloomy out there

Where r the kilos of drugs which you and Shahrukh store in ur houses. Be real accept the ugly truth

Hate story 4 should be in u r bedroom 😄

Looks so scary
After coming out of jail, Aryaan will come back to this house again 🤣
In this also your son must have taken drugs.
Those memories mein autyaji charas ganja latakana bhool gayo
The moment the camera entered her house, my claustrophobia smirked at me.🥴 I know everyone has their own preferences but what the heck with no natural lighting..??!! Do rich ppl don&#39;t have windows in their house.? I hope you genuinely enjoy that interior of yours.

Few years later aryan khan would be redesigning this house with his memories.

People can be so negative ...just read the comments or do not read Don&#39;t know what to suggest..???

Son inside the steel bar...😀😀

Likes are more for comments than vedio 🤣🤣🤣

The luxurious lifestyle they r Njoying credit goes to us the aam janta... We purchased movie tkts with our hard earned money and made these anti nationals our hero.. They stay here in India but they r Pakistan lovers.... Making them king... Is our mistake.. We have to rectify that... Jai hind.. Jai bharat 🇮🇳

Give some more charas and ganja to Aryan!!!! Just try not to get drugs.
More of a combination of a museum ,hotel , cemetery.Lighting (lamps) in front of the painting, disaster .Butterflies ,Once flying, now FRAMED by the family .. Is she really a designer ?

Ye ..we got it lots of .opluent spaces.lots of mahogany or  cedarwood.....furniture...pastel rugs and curtains.. mirrors...lights and some books and indoor plants.....there yiu go...you are a  designer...by the way how about doing these without an infinite bank account.

And drugs 😂

Look where you won't find drugs🤣😁
Please add some charas and gaanja on those walls for Aryan Khan

These fake pretentious actors wives are all designers 😂

How is this a home tour? We literally saw the entryway and that’s about it. Total bs. If you want your privacy then don’t do the freaking home tour.

Awesome home and decor

Looks like a hotel.....to each her own

😂😂😂

This is not college dorms in Korea

Open schools in remote areas for free education for the poor children. Do the interior design of those schools too 😋. Good for the society and good guinea pigs to try out interior designs.

I was expecting better. All I see is dark &amp; shady walls. Oh well, everyone’s have their own tastes

This is all public money...aren't you ashamed???? Go out of your house..go within 10 km radius of your school, there are lifeless animals yearning for a loaf of bread and you have seen all this here. I spit on you and your kids.
Drug lord Aryan Khan 😁😁😁😆😆😄😄
Ola hu Uber kaboooooom 🔥
Bakwas

Roll a joint a put in aryans room too now. Great memory eh !

Drugs room😂😂Aaryan Khan special
Leave the business now. Take care of the boy. How much money do you need?
And where are the bottles of drinks and sweets kept?
Sry

Beautiful house and your drug addict son in jail. 😆 🤣

Just help the house, also help the people living in the house, make their upbringing better, BAAP says that the son of the girl is drunk, what will he do if he takes drugs, how will you get a little money, pair in the sky and the upbringing is useless.. ..I am sad for your son but you are the reason, mother and father.
There&#39;s Dakota Johnson&#39;s house and then there&#39;s this whose owner is an interior designer.

I feel it dark 🌑 suffocating home more like an studio

How will suhani do makeup. You keep it in frame.

THEY JUST FORGOT THEIR OLD LIFE STYLE 😒😒😒😒😒😒😏😏😏
Yr mark didn't seem to like it
Arayn is innocent boy

show  aryan   home  tour   where  he  is  put   after  caught

Okay I&#39;m here during the arrest of aryan khan  lol

Collecting butterflies is a huge cruelty.

As for Gauri Khan, cant this wall bail Aryan Khan?

Now tell me, can this MANNAT MANAGED TO BAIL ARYAN KHAN?

The homes of dead living inhuman beings.who have no feelings for others.self absorbed, learn to live ur life like Sushant.Sushant is love.

Nonsense vogue!
The whole house look so depressing.thats why SRK is depresses most of the times by living in this haunted interior house.

Imagine on her birthday only Aryan went to jail 😭

Why YouTube recommended this video after Aryan Khan arrested 😂😂😂

Boucht with drugs money.shame to this gandi peoples 🥵

Who cares?

I came to see Aryan’s room but ughhh!🌚😂

Prepare for your home tour in your jhanaza into your beautiful graveyard dear

Children were born in jail, they taught me how to get drunk.
Gauri khan always remembers me Lady Macbeth.depressed woman

Honestly,, i dont like to see most of india interior design

I love Shahrukh Khan
Happiest birthday gauri...🎂
I love this family but, I got to be honest, this is not my ideal home. No sunshine, no plants, old items, no colors….

Whts so great In ths

drugs ka money hai......chor....illegal money .....

This is the 1st home made with 3 walls 🐸🐸🐸🐸

&quot;In your favorite wall - full of memories&quot;, kindly put all kinds of illegal substances  beside Aryan&#39;s racquet..

this is not home tour this is home wall tour

useless aunty

i also have some request please put it drugs in that frame for aryan hahah

@VOGUEINDIA Perhaps change the title to 3 walls  house tour in 3min . ??

Gauri's mind has gone haywire...and there is no more money...she is unable to digest much money.
Glamor n drugs
Why rich people in India like to exhibit their house...is it a superior complex....gauri khan..suzanne khan...now Debina n Gurmeet...What nonsence

Looking at those frames I was like &quot;kuch bhi&quot; !! Toy Makeup kits in frames, seriously!?!?! Paisa ho toh jo marzi karke bol do &quot;Art pieces&quot;!! Pathetic sense of esthetics!!

Ek drugs k pics ki bhi wall bana deti..

Who come srk son arrested

I LOVE EARTHLY COLORS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION OF THE HOUSE IN THE EARTHMASON SOLOMON 📐📏✏️
Wht is the use of all this big houses whn u have no time for yr children. Very sad

One thing i decided that if i ever become millionare, i will never give contract to any of these  actresses interior desigers 😁. There houses are big but boring and dull in colours. More like some horror sets

Instead of showing a home which looks like a museum...she should have taken great care of her son knowing that her husband is a very busy person....If I were in her place I would have enjoyed my life taking more care of my children instead of collecting art pieces and indulging in home designing....

Mediocrity at its best. you call this worth featuring ? Vogue really. Put some standards by quality not popularity. Feature some new designers....more adaptive and versatile spaces. These Art collectors call themselves designer??

Madam, the hell with your memory wall. Where is the bloody house?

Some rubbish taking and waste my 3 minures

This house is looking less like a bungalow and more like a bungalow.
Here after NCB raid..!!🥲
Weird Family

Look after your kids then looking after your homes beauty 🤔 and wealth. Family is more important 🤔

Very nice body

Why is the house looks so gloomy…. &amp; cold.  Doesnt look like its lived in ….very staged and no soul…

For all the people who are calling out Aryans parents for his misdeeds are as thick as two short planks. Its really sad that they are being accused of bad parenting. Who in their right mind would teach their child to do all such things. To accuse someone is very easy but life will bring it back to these people one day because what goes around comes around. It is on that day they&#39;ll realise the pain of a parent , be it rich or poor, superstar or common man.

My Room is much airy, bright, painted well, and clean that this  depressing house. all memories, nothing alive

Charsi family

Go on a cruise.
i loved the interiors ... gauri has great taste.. its beautifulquestion is how are all of those plants still standing like that with no sunlight in the space...? or did they get it inside for the shoot?

The more you care for your home, the more you care for Aryan.
Jesus bloody cold and gloomy...no wonder Aryan stones out😁

Mirror is placed so high, one can only see his or her forehead.

@<a href="">2:00</a> time to put charas, ganja and MD up on that wall

the house seems very dreppesing

ARAYAN WOULD LOVE IT ...HOPE THERE IS A CRUISE SHIP NEAR THIS HOME ...

My kids are only 3 &amp; 7 and I have tons of things of my kids that there are no walls left. And she had just some makeup brushes and killed butterflies to share. Couldn&#39;t even teach her child that butterflies are for looking not running after them and definitely not killing them and putting them in a box just because you like them.

congrats! spoiled brat @NCB

Honestly- This was bullshit.. my house is small but much prettier than this.

Drugs ka tour to do madam 😂😂
Happiness beautify family to sirjiandmamjihometoo

Aryan
Was it the home tour or&#39;the 3 walls tour&#39;??🙄🙄

This is an offence to hundreds of millions of hard working poor Indians, may of them without sanitation and electricity.

Inside house = ask NCB

Aryan khan arrested taking drugs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol, pretty bad

So they have only a sitting a room

I don&#39;t like the decore it&#39;s too dull

Dark Academia Meets Royalty Core ✨😍

Shah Rukh and Gauri have a collection of luxurious homes, and this speaks volumes of their wealth.

Ur one click can change my life

Who cares about your daughter makeup brushes.. it’s your family business keep to your family only.. negative message to young girls

i didn&#39;t like this house interior at all..sonam&#39;s was wayyyyy better

Nothing to show in the home else walls and memories

Both r cheaps
This is not a house...This is what you call a dark dungeon...

My wall is also filled with memories ..  Pencil marks to check my height.. marks of the poster which is removed now.. many other

It looks like set of horror movies How they live in such suffocated home

Haunted House

She better not speak and let Shahrukh do all the talking and thinking. Band thi muthi to lakh ki khuli to khaak ki.😛

Home filled with garbage..throw them away..instead fill with some useful books

All negative comments so it is time to stop showing your face and all BS

I had expected Shahrukh’s home to be one of a kind. Full of memorabilia of the places they went to and pics and artifacts. Turned out to be pretentious &amp; boring.

This is definitely not their actual home, just another investment maybe

So  much darkness
The worst house and useless memories like make up brushes … i literally thought she would say the awards and achievements on that third depressing wall but brushes butterfly…  dude this is your Delhi dull house…

So she was a South Delhi girl 😂

They are lizards they love to live on walls.😂

Is this a house or a dark mansion... looks like someone has called a foreign interior designer and got it done.
Very bad. Doesn&#39;t look like Shahrukh&#39;s house. Everything is dark and hideous. If she designed it then don&#39;t know what you say. Bad

Man! The hatred in this comment section is darker than the house. I love buildings with big windows &amp; lots of sunlight &amp; all but that doesn&#39;t mean everyone has to! She might have light sensitivity which people with migraine has to deal with. Maybe she switched on the incandescent lamps to set a vintage mood for the video. Freedom of speech is cool until you loose your cool cause someone else&#39;s house is not the way you want. And associating a house with depression? Dark interiors do not cause depression. Dark people does.

Stop trolling! Whatever she showed you would complain about it. Let her live!

Memories of coke and popcorn?  Rackets and hair brush as collectibles? Something&#39;s missing here. Yep -  creativity and imagination.

See she has beautiful house .. nice clothes . Money but why is she n addict

&quot;She love to do makeup so we framed it!&quot; Suhana be like &quot;ab me makup kaise karun&quot;

Botax trofy wife of srk

Loving the comment section, stress buster.

Walls tour

She has nothing to show except that &quot;IAM THE WIFE OF SHAHRUKH KHAN&quot; 😁😁

My favorite wall full of memories!!Has like five frames without a single picture in them and two rackets haging which are pretty much unrelatable duhhhhh

Wall full of memories appeared really shallow.... I bet having soooo many houses she might have forgotten why n what each room or wall looks like with no clue as to why it is decore the way it is.....

What a wise man this is :P
Where is the house tour ???

Sonam Kapoor has better and elegent taste, expensive show pieces can make any pace look elegant,,her house has no ideas only show pieces

She killed the butterflies to put them on a wall !!!!????? These rich people!!!!

I was falling asleep as she was speaking 🙄

No wonder why people from Bollywood are so shady, they live in such a dingy place.

Makeup brush????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 like seriously
Aisa lgta haii jaise ghar to haiii but zindagi kii kami haii.... There must be some lively feelings.....They should have light , greenery ,.... Bachche hasiiiii.khushiii... that makes  house a home

&quot;The ones who felt bad for those butterflies have already eaten an animal in their lives!&quot;-someone who knows the truth!

How did those plants even survive?! there is little to no sunlight 😵 must be fake ones

<b>Money 💰  talks   baby  ....</b>
This reminds of the house from the conjuring part 1. Looks straight out of a horror movie set.

Useless people ...showcasing dead butterflies ....thats an ART for them. 😑😑😑😑

Memory wall is truly a bitter laugh for people who knows ART. She calls herself designer..? Go and see how Sonam designed her home. ..thats called taste 🤣🤣🤣

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I cudnt like even a piece in this home, no matter how hard I convince myself. Its just useless, gives no pleasure and peace. I really really really liked Sonam&#39;s London home. That was indeed something simple and classy. Much better than this black shady house.

Very dark house

No sun light no nature don&#39;t like at all
She looks like a ghost with all that botox and house looks haunted

How come they call this &quot;home&quot;. These are not functional cozy comfortable home, but some showpiece or showroom with zero positive vibe. In any case, Gauri Khan doesn&#39;t know A.. B... C of home designing or interior designing.She has v v bad taste. Stuffing walls with expensive material is &quot;never&quot; home!!!

This doesn&#39;t feel like home to me . Sorry to say this

Home Lane does better interiors than this dark house lol

Multi millionaire and talks as if she was reading from the paper and the house is so not good

Honestly saying my mother can decorate more beautifuly and civily than gauri khan

It actually looks scary

Looks to dark and gothic not welcoming at all

Who the hell frames a makeup kit, height of vanity

butterflies like a show pieces?

Aww too dark and depressing 😢

How can they live in closed spaces without windows, sunlight and air??? OMG I felt claustrophobic just looking at the video...

I thought wall of memories would&#39;ve lovely pictures.. things rich people do

Let there be sunlight!

I suppose it works for them while it could be too dingy and not a comfortable place for some. I wonder why vogue is only capturing the lights, the walls and the stairs. Wasn&#39;t this a home tour?

I didn&#39;t expect the king srk lives in this kind of house. Trash House 😷

Shah Rukh Khan how are you now this 2021? Im a fan from Phillippines

Shah Rhuk Khan how is he?
Looks like old English movie home or dungeon 😁.Everything is dark.
Lol... Just getting and filling house with expensive stuff doesn&#39;t make u an interior designer, hate the design looks depressing

She is known as one of the best interior designer but Tbh I didn&#39;t liked it at all..!Me Being just a teenager can design it better😅😅I just need money to buy the products, Lol 😂

These are real heros who do and die for their country unlike movie stars , cricketers or businessmen who become whoever they are by public money , time and attention but when time comes they are ready to fly at safer harbour like UK , Canada etc..Guys don&#39;t waste your money and time on such things it&#39;s better to help army men family though time and money. Jai Hind Jai Bharat !

The house is really beautiful ngl, but the interior designer made it look more like a luxury vacacy villa than a HOME. It&#39;s mad suffocating.

girl this isnt even a house tour. i came here looking for inspiration for my client and i see 2 badminton rackets and an algaonema plant 🙄 vogue, can yall at least walk up the stairs

Lol,why so many toxic English comments

Not the home i expected for these 2 and their family. In the doco they appear more wholesome and freer than this drab and dreary space

The music so fucking irritating  😡😡😡

Shahrukh khan king 🤴 of bollywood ❤️💋❤️💋💋💋
Love ur family

Tons of jealous people in the comment section. . talking about sunlight homes in delhi ..c&#39;mon

at <a href="">0:30</a>, The buddhha book under the irror in the vanity house, is just a sign of hypocrisy, narsciss, n stupidity

kumar rehmani pakistani
So suffocating.... cave people

Is it only me who sees nothing but walls , pics and a big mirror? And why was it so dark there? Dark and gloomy.

I love uu😍😍😍
Worst camera angles I have ever seen on a house tour. No wide angle shots showing the house

With this portfolio u will not get a job of 12k per month.unfortunately u r a wife of king khan so u can do anything u want.

Paisa ho to kya kuch nai ho sakta 😂

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.... I Loooove Bollywood, I live in Asia, I want to be the first Transgender Bollywood Wife!!!

Why does every rich Indian act extra posh and try so hard to be western? What&#39;s wrong in keeping close to your roots?

God Bless MAdam

People know you becoz of srk wife..its more Honor 4 u than telling u r a designer..u r a fool

Haunted House! 😳😮😧
<a href="">2:07</a> wat abt Suhanas first bra &amp; Aryans first underwear 😂
Earning money for this country but donate money to the nebour country..Boycott these people for lifetime.

idky the homes of rich people are so dimly lit...gloomy is the word and not glamorous

Madam, your husband is very hot.
Very nice 👍👍👍👍👍
𝓝𝓲𝓬𝓮 ... 😍😍...
Self obsessed with her own designing. Killing butterflies and putting on wall. If you have That much money atleast do something charitable rather showing off all these stuffs which is not at all relatable to common men. That why 80 percent indian struggle for food and job. Rather creating employment and helping these people just show off and waste time of common people. Even No light, such a depressing lighting as if no energy. 🤣. It is totally hilarious designing.

Luck was good that she got married to Shahrukh.
I can&#39;t believe you are so proud about the butterflies. What a cruel mind. And the house looks cold and uninviting not warm and happy.

The homeowner seems very nice.

Why do you people design so worst being an Interior Designer 👎

Gouri ji is the best mother ❤️

WowThis lady puts the rug as frame…lol 😂

It&#39;s shows... Rich become more richer 🤣😂😹

Not gud 👎
All that money but zero taste. No, I will never employ you as my interior designer, Ghauri Khan

The fake peoples .

Love u gauriji shahrukh sir😁😁love u kida love u ranbirji ankita
Bari bari batain bari bari backchodiyaan. Bare bare log .

I understand what you are saying, but it is very beautiful
If you have that much money then no designer will come to your house..Faltu baat 🤣
If you want to see home then visit John Abraham, Anna Suniel Shetty.

Superb home and collection mam

Chill guys this isn&#39;t her only home

Excellent designing...of rooms...and beautiful your memories

Why does this feel like a haunted house? 🙄.

Ghost house 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

looking like horror movies house

Bombay, Delhi, where next Culcutta or Bangalore

Great architecture in India😍

Bakwas chize 🤧

L ove state
Shah Rukh Khan is truly india&#39;s version of Brad Pitt.

Love u SRK❤️
Isne Abraham ka toys to dikhaya to nahi

Haatt... love jihadi.
It’s such a dark space, did not like it

They don&#39;t really show the house. The caption seems deceiving

Wall of memories have only few item ,jaise abhi abhi banai gai hu😆

More than interior, i liked the work of camera❤️

Owe the yiaz ... owe the yiaz... fake af

Ohhhhhh god gouri ki tarha hi black black home hy not anything entrsting 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Its just collectibles over the years!

It looks too much hochpack couldn&#39;t see any windows to get sunlight. Natural light is always necessary in the room

Gauri, you are Shahrukh&#39;s stength ..I know how beautiful you are from both inside and out ..we share the same birthdate - 8th october ..lord Shani who is a great teacher . I can feel your love for your children - as all mothers do with best of our capabilities .You are a sincere loving wife ,mother ,daughter and sister in law .Great respect for you both .I know where you are coming from ..Saturn gives us isolation ..embrace it as it will bring out the best of you from past lives, I can say so as I have been through the same affluence and great morals from my parents as you do .There is a positivity in all your family members which can&#39;t be overlooked.I know the higher you go, there is less oxygen .. I have experienced it myself as God is very generous to me too with material things ..but they never suffice .You are a Shakti and can overcome all challanges just one advice go for serving people which you both do . Be that shakti who can come out and help clean bollywood as it is harming our children too .Shahrukh is a great actor and a good soul and you both compliment each other. Gauri you are a beautiful soul and your love for your family shows in your eyes and deed .I will repeat myself please know your shakti and be a reformer . Your Delhi home is beautiful as its a reflection of your love. And please lets work on teaching our kids the true meaning of happiness- love, compassion, and service. We have a social responsibility ! ❤

Killed butterfly shame

The marijuana Madam

Druggies hate natural light.. they love darkness more

Islamwood

Karachiwood
All that money no taste

Normal housewives are very fond of beautifying the house and that is why every rich celebrity's wife is an interior designer because they have a lot of money to buy a house and a house.
You lost me at dead butterflies

Aap to jan hai hamri jan king khan ki
Excuse me, where&#39;s the house in the video?

Showing just fakely made walls are we... Ya that&#39;s all ufilm folks are... Walls

Pathetic... She&#39;s so fake
The house is so dark and depressing. I am wondering Conjuring 4 shooting might happen in this house.

To think there are families living on the streets and some have 2 homes.  😔

This is weird.

Not my type at all....!! I would hate to stay there  for even a minute

Very nice home interior and design ❤️👍
Lucky woman.

Dono ek dusre k liye lucky tthaaa

The wallpaper on the staircase is same as the one we have in our living room and its 15 yrs old🤣 cant believe me and srk have same wallpapers nw

Where exactly in Delhi ?

When money starts flowing, I start making log style.😆😆
Light to lagana chahiye tha to or acchese ghar dikhta

Can everyone stop shaming celebrities? It&#39;s LITERALLY HER house! Y&#39;all can chill!

I am watching you in all the videos..
Boycott srk crap
how tasteless everything is

Wall tour😂

I can just see she is fails to differentiate between a museum and a home and just lacks aesthetic sense.

Looking like haunted house we can&#39;t live here😎

Mere ghr pe bhi deewar pe raquet hand krte the...

You didn’t actually show us the house, just a small snippet of memorabilia.

worst home tour i have ever seen
