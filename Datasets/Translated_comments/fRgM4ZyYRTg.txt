<a href="">59:30</a> ..Irrfan Khan sir&#39;s vision was ahead of that time

<a href="">44:17</a> Irrfan Sir bored (and possibly irritated as well) after constantly interrupted by star kid multiple times.

literally the BEST roundtable conversation i’ve ever watched!

People remember you Irfan. We remember you.

If I have to make a poster of the &quot;Commercial Hindi Film Industry&quot; it&#39;ll include the showman Raj Kapoor, Tragedy king Dilip Kumar, Superstar Rajesh khanna, Big B Amitabh Bachchan, Dilwale Shahrukh Khan and the Raymond Shri Ranbir Kapoor ❤ RK

The beutiful line of Irrfan sir is  im not khan im just Irrfan

@<a href="">1:01:40</a>  waqt lgta hai pr ho jata

<a href="">1:01:10</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Someone plz cut Varun part
I am not Khan, i am irrfan. ~irfan khan

fabulous irrfan fabulous .....
I like how Akshay embraces everyone and watch other&#39;s work and appreciate ❤

In this entire talk...the one thing that i like the behaviour of akshay sir towards irfan sir. ❤ The interviewer could talk in their comfort zone. I don&#39;t think they were feeling comfortable.

Akshay kumar is hilarious in the interview

Khiladi is the real complete HERO❤,,,,,,aur industry main baki bohut toh overrated hain😊

&quot;&quot;&quot;TUUU&quot;&quot; and &quot;tuu&quot; ❤

Judwaa 2 was a good choice??😂😂 Lol and even it was not a choice iykyk

IRFAN SIR 🥹
<a href="">20:45</a> IRRFAN😂😂🙏

What is Varun Dhawan doing here?
Akshay Kumar is a best father as well ❤🎉I literally admire his discipline

Hearing varun and ayushman talking so much is so irritating!

<a href="">1:00</a>: 40 fruit spots😂😂
Sense of Humour of Akshay&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Varun dhawan, not the one to associate with these artists yet loud one

I don&#39;t what is varun dhawan doing there 😅

ye varun tok kyu deta hai bich main irfan sirr ko..sala bak bak

Varun Dhawan has acted in which movie of Badlapur Ko Chor?
Whats nepotism kid varun doing between this self made😂😂

Irrfan and rakumar❤

Varun dhawan talkin d most.... empty vessels make d most noise.

Akshay is naturally funny and Irfan is so deep and enlightening.. they r so damn gud ... love thm

I don&#39;t know why bt watching this on 2024 made me realize again.. previous roundtables  used to hit dfntly..I just finished watching All the roundtables of 2023 stil came bk hr to satisfy my self ❤

People will watch netflix... well said irrfan sir

this is not an interview or chat but an acting masterclass

Irfaan ❤ Loving the fact akshay is talking exactly looking at irfaan like face to face ! Closeness <a href="">#oldisgold</a>

I wanna add that I keep revisiting this interview and every other interviews just to cherish IRRFAN

I am not Khan, I am just Irfaan..... ❤❤❤
Varun Dhawan is busy licking Akshay&#39;s shoes through out the video, wish he was not invited to this forum

Way of talking of irfan sir , rajkumar and aayushman are very appealing.

Love it ❤

Why Varun Dhawan is here is he actor?😂😂😂😂

wow man....irfan sir just said the truth about films working right now won&#39;t work after 3 years.... people will watch it in theatres...right now in the period of multi star starrer massy films....these type of films of low budget but great indian house stories had lost its plot somewhere.....what a vision of this legend....hats off 💜

Then saw Irrfan again❤
<a href="">24:30</a>

Varun!! Shut up 😂😂😂😂 irritating as fuck in this entire episode

Remembering irrfan sir in 2023 dec and will remember him...(jurassic world , the amazing spiderman, life of pi) karvaan, qarib qarib single, hindi &amp; english medium...it&#39;s all love...🖤🌺✨🫂💐

Varun dhawan&#39;s talk shows he is not upto that level

Akshay kumar dialogue first 40 sec the way he said Sir apka kya plan is quite funny

Akshay is a whole vibe in this interview 😂

<a href="">29:57</a> Bhosadika interrupts sir ko
Irfan : no. 1 rank holder, 90+ avg score in every subjectsAksay : middle bencher, 60+avg score in every subjectsRajkumar : 1st bencher, 80+ avg score in every subjectsAyusman : back bencher, 50+ avg score in every subjectsVarun : rusticated from school

...

4 National Award winners  pretty crazy

inko😊
Atleast Varun don&#39;t deserve to be on this table

<a href="">5:31</a>

Varun and Aayushman kind of spoiled the roundtable. Irrfan sir, Akshay sir and Rajkumar make so much sense.

You people live in Hindustan, why do you give so much importance to English, are you ashamed to talk in Hindi, it feels like a low standard??…
<a href="">1:01:19</a> it all came true what irfan sir said 😊

Irfan Saab ❤❤❤❤
varun dhavan talks a lot :D such a wannabe

<a href="">24:16</a> rajkumar was asking to irfan sir but then he said you too to akki😅and just see rajkumar at  <a href="">25:14</a> he was tapping on table it shows that he was very curious to know irfan sir process of acting that after joke he instantly ask irfan sir so that nobody will change the topic

<a href="">28:07</a>

<a href="">29:58</a> I will never forgive Varun Dhawan for interrupting what Irfan Sir was saying. It was such a profound conversation and now we will never know.

Imran sirr❤ missing you
Irfan khan on another level

Why he didn&#39;t invite Sushant?

<a href="">28:08</a> Brother that scene is my favorite too 👏👏
Irfan khan: This Varun madarchod kitna bola hai bey Rajkumar Rao: Ye sala Varun, he doesn't even know how much he has said.
Varun Dhawan's bus remembers Badlapur. Brother, what is he doing among these people, I am not able to understand.
<a href="">5:30</a>....that control 😅

Irfan sir ❤

Akshay And Kapil&#39;s ENGLISH is Almost Same 🤣 .... Cringe

Everything is fine but this extra cow is being spent in the beach for a couple of days. That's also world no 1 actor with Irfaan Khan. Miss you brother.
Irfan 😍
Humbleness and Simplicity of Akshay Kumar ❤❤

Adhjal gagri chalkar jaat stands true for Varun dhawan.amonh exceptional actors especially irfan and rajkumar roa.He is the one sharing his views most of times

Irrfan was seeing the future <a href="">1:00:29</a>

Irrfan was audience is getting mature and industry is struggling

<a href="">1:01:53</a> golden words by Irrfan Sir

<a href="">24:16</a> Akshay was damn hilarious😂😂

35 : 33 bahubali telugu cinema 🔥 prabhas 🦖🔥
Bahubali🔥🔥🤙 mania 2017 and 2018 whole remakewood bollywood Mafia jelousey 😂😂😂😂

There&#39;s all these great actors. And then there&#39;s Varun dhawan.

Me to varun:Hurry in the car, quickly fall in the car
Let&#39;s be serious, does varun deserves to be here ?

<a href="">1:00:30</a> . . . its come true now

Irfan khan predicted about Bollywood in 2018 what&#39;s gonna happen in 2022 although movies are working now in 2023 but whatever he said was absolutely spot on regarding his Hollywood experiences

Varun Dhawan please shut up, you are disturbing us!

Irrfan Khan❤

Actors will always remain confused throughout their career pehle acting class mein bolte yeh aisa karo.....graduation mein bolte jaisa director chahata hai waisa karo.....ab kiski sune tisra tumhara kaun sunega

Who eats this wine, cake and coffee in one meal?
Can someone plz kickout varun or mute him!

Woh..irfan sir prediction became true..

People who are trolling and ignoring varun Dhawan have some little respect to that actor iam not a fan of varun Dhawan neither even i think that he is eligible to sit with these legends but that doesn&#39;t mean ki usko kuch nahi atha ..look at his performance in sui dhaga October badlapur he is improving and learning from his films !

Someone had to be made to sit with Irrfan Khan, he was on the table, Nana Patekar, Randeep Hooda, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Rajkumar, and Manoj Bajpayee... Well, all of them should have been made to sit on a carpet spread below, and listen to Irrfan Khan. It is necessary because when the Guru speaks, the disciples sit down and listen.
Brother, who makes that donkey Varun Dhawan sit with Irrfan?? The rest is at least fine, he is learning from Irrfan Khan.
OMG they all don&#39;t deserve to seat in front of Irfan sir,Irfan Khan is beyond all of them even any other Khan ,no one can touch his acting level.

From <a href="">24:15</a> Rajkumar was so keen to know about the process of Irrfan sir like you can see how he is so stressed and asks repeatedly like a child asking his teacher 💖

Irfan Khan comes from a royal jaipuri family and he didn&#39;t give a damn about lineage

Just went back to see this episode for Irfann Khan but I so loved watching Akshay and others as well ❤

@ 40.01 why not?
<a href="">51:30</a> - <a href="">52:00</a> This is a very dirty disease...the time has come to cure it in the next one and a half year... UP UNTIL 31ST DECEMBER 2024... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not audible
Irrfan Amar Hai ... Legacy cannot be replace..always in heart.

Four selfmade in one❤ seeing is worthy

If you think about it, this interview was conducted in 2018, the same year Irrfan was diagnosed with Cancer.So there&#39;s a slim chance that he already was diagnosed before this interview.

<a href="">44:44</a>

Varun ko nhi lana tha

It&#39;s ironic that Akshay has gone on record saying that Bollywood needs multi-hero films. After the treatment he&#39;s given his co-stars by cutting their roles in other movies (Phir Hera Pheri, Bhagam Bhag, Deewane Huye Paagal, Garam Masala...) can you blame them for refusing?

I came here for mr. Irfan.

Jhutha kumar from canada

Im watching again and again, bcz of Akshay&#39;s tremendous sense of humor!! 😆😅😅🤣🤣

I don’t understand why people don’t  talk about &quot;Madari&#39; much more. It was splendid

Varun worst actor here
<a href="">46:32</a> did u noticed he was tensed about his son Babil and Irrfan sir was so honest and gud hearted 😥

Here over rated is varun he is good for nothing jhst spoon feed hy his dad and he should tell govinda was one who gave 1st opportunity debut to his dad , and he is just coping him

Varun is so irritating asshole.

Film - illusion World. 😕
Why didn&#39;t they mention that Ayushmann also starred in Bareilly ki Barfi alongside Rajkumar? He was gold in that film

Akshay seems like such a misfit in this almost elite group of serious actors.

Varun chutiya shop of overacting what is he doing among the legends 😅😅😅😅😅
varun dhawan between them . really ?

Irrfan&#39;s laugh is really contagious for me

Akshay try to show more but actually he is not..

Rank of this table according to acting skills: 1. Irfan Khan 2. Rajkumar Rao3. Akshay Kumar 4. Ayushman 5. Varun Dhawan

Who called this warrior here?
<a href="">55:48</a> IRFAN SIR YOU ARE AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE  REMEMBERED AS A LEGENDARY ACTOR  ❤
Came  just for 5minutes but I have finished the full video.❤️

I don&#39;t know why but I always wanted to see irrfan khan in osho&#39;s biopic because they both have similar kind of voice and eyes. It would have been a treat to watch.

Akshay&#39;s comic timing is unmatchable 😂

<a href="">1:00:23</a> he predicted everything at that time ,he is the gem that we had lost

Varun talks too much
<a href="">24:16</a> lol yadav is so pissed by dhawan&#39;s nonsense answer he wants to restore some sense into the discussion &amp; asks bhatia to speak.&amp; again the same thing at <a href="">25:19</a>.he is telling the sensible people pleas speak so that this idiot doesn&#39;t keep yapping away

<a href="">10:59</a> lol dhawan bastard doesn&#39;t understand the difference between a cop &amp; a psycopath killer🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">6:10</a> marketing.chutiye you are still doing the same. Acting doesn't work
<a href="">6:07</a> Aaahhh the great thespian naseeruddin shah speaks

<a href="">4:10</a> he didn&#39;t mention which army. Obviously he meant canadian army

<a href="">29:00</a> both khurrana &amp; dhawan chutiyas r here to feel like great actors even though they r not

<a href="">25:51</a> when irrfan khan is talking about not getting a script even after reading it fo six months bhatia idiot points to him as if &quot;see even he faces the same thing&quot;.idiot canadian kuma. He was a true artist. He didn&#39;t open a puri bhaji dukaan of actin like u.u r a nonsense non actor. Dont even agree to what an artist like khan says

<a href="">30:00</a> look at dhawan chutiya. Firstly he is comparin himself to bhatia who has been working more than his age. Secondly he tells khan &quot;even you&quot; as if he&#39;d patronizing him. This is what nepotism does. U feel entitled as if Bollywood is your property &amp; others r junior to u

Who the hell invited Varun to the table!?

y&#39;all i&#39;m crying varun literally vented about how he wanted to make out with alia sitting beside irrfan who has clearly faced real life actor challenges

Irfan khan sir is a enlightened human being with a clear thought about his life, acting and family. 2.1M view for Ayushman and Rajkumar learning from Akshay kumar and Irfan Sir. Meanwhile Varun dhawan blabbering shit about only him, trying hard to make himself heard and not realizing where he is sitting.

<a href="">1:00:29</a> golden words
Irfan sir❤️
Where did you go?
Back when Roundtables where fun

Be like Irfan, listen everyone quietly and speaks only when it is needed and asked.

Best roundtable
I see this video in 2022 and what Irfan says at <a href="">1:00:10</a> is that OTT changed the type of movies it literally becomes right. Akshay old types movies have gone flopped.

Maqbul is the greatest 🔥

I am only here for Akshay and Irrfan 🔥🫶

After watching this we can say that akshay is a mega star and irfan is legend ❤

I really really wish Varun shut his mouth his a bit, so that other talented actors could talk? Always interrupting. Nobody cares about Badrinath when we&#39;re listening to Maqbool.

One of my favourite interviewWatched it multiple times

Men whenever Rajkumar rap sir speaks just pure knowledge pure talent giving us super positive vibes this men is on another level bro , much much love nd may god gives him so many success I wish raj sir get oscar one day one day for sure ❤️please god he is the only one who can get this his hard work acting level of acting bro he is gonna get it one day for sure I’m near future fingers cross

Would have been a better discussion without Varun and probably Akshay as well. They are pretty one dimensional actors in company of some amazing actors. They can talk about acting skills when they have earned that right to talk about it

<a href="">59:42</a>

Watched 20 times just for Irrfan sir 💫❤ <a href="">#legend</a>
Poor rajkumar, didn't get a chance to talk.
Rajeev Masand Roundtable:Varun Dhawan, Irrfan Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao.
VD nepotism

Bob Proctor is the King of creating results. He helped me manifesting my dream channel and reach millions of people.<a href="">

The only thing I hate about this interview is Rajeev Masand and his over pretentious Delhi or over sophisticated accent.

<a href="">56:15</a> 💔
Just saying Varun 🥴🥴 mtlab kyu.. he is a great actor that showed in October n badlapur but the movies he is here for mtlab kyu..

Miss you Irfan Sir!
Both Pathaan and Patnaik sitting together. (AAN)

I really loved this conversation.

Boycott bollywoodJustice for SSR

Akshay Kumar in logo 🤣🤣
Irrfan and Akshay have a great great comic timingSpecially Irrfan

Akshay is a so big superstar than all other but he is so humble and fun loving and made other youngsters comfortable

Irrfan❤
<a href="">1:00</a> Irfan knew about current situation of bollywood

Can we remove Varun Dhawan
Earlier Irrfan sir had predicted that this film will not run after 3-4 years.
Akshay Kumar is soooooooooooo hilarious

Varun daqan tlks lot
varun ur acting is mix of salman and govinda talking of an expressive actor like ayushmaan khurana like seriously

Literally Salman and Ajay were the two biggest stars in 2017.

gr8

All Hindi Actors are giving interview in English

Irrfan khan the legend

What is Varun dhawan doing here 😐

Akshay stopped varun mostly in full interview ☺

No disrespect to Varun but I wanted to hear more from others. Somehow I found him irritating here.

Provide us a option to skip Varun speaking😒

Akshay kumar jyaada energy lagata hai, he is not a natural actor

Why Varun Dhawan 😂😂😂

My favourite roundtable discussion 😁👌😍
That cheerful hug at <a href="">24:46</a> by Akshay Kumar was really sweet he was cheering Irfan sir like a buddy.♥️

R.I.P Irfan sir 💔
That&#39;s fantastic conversation i ever heard 🙂 i just love it how they praise each other&#39;s work ☺️

Best roundtable discussion ever, I&#39;ve come back to this interview so many times and always get amused. It has the right amount of intellectuality and humour. Also, the major factor of this interview is Irfan sir. I have immense love and respect for him. It is such a joy to listen to his replies 🤍

Great salute to Irfaan saab❤️❤️❤️
Rip💐💐💐💐
Rip💐💐💐💐💐
Ayushman is my fvrt actor and his voice ufffs lot&#39;s of love from Assam

The only 2 misfits akki and Varun..and they know it..

<a href="">11:45</a> ❤
1)Irrfan2)Rajkumar3)Ayushman4)Akshya5)Varun
Just for akshay Kumar I have watched it ❤️ he is literally funny and the values life he share ❤️

Every year round table,,, there has been ayushman 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Only one question Why Varun Dhawan is here?

<a href="">25:00</a>

<a href="">24:30</a>

Irfan Khan Rip🙏🙏🙏🙏what an honest man I always admire him Akshay Kumar is also great actor

All are best

What the hell is varun doing between such talented people?

Akshay Kumar being funny <a href="">24:16</a>.
<a href="">1:00:30</a>.....what he said is true......

Ayushman seems so fake at times, with his bookish one liners.

Varun is such an ass. He has been cutting out Raj several times. Once again I have to say that there is no peace in us too, to overconfident Varun - Raj is being punished!!
Canadian can&#39;t get a job in Indian Army 😂😂😂🤣🤣
You can&#39;t like not love Akshay Kumar 😍♥️♥️♥️
All best 👌

Varun Dhawan trying to be smart 😂

Varun dhwan is such a misfit in this show?like what dad and dad one of the top director???😏

What is the sense of calling Varun Dhawan in this roundtable.Instead of Varun Dhawan if rajiv masand called nawazuddin or Hrithik Roshan in this roundtable then it would be better.I don&#39;t understand sometimes the selection by Rajiv masand of the actors for the roundtable.

Akshay is a very good person in real life.Example of that was when once ouatim 2 flops so he returned his half salary 25 crores to producer so that he can recover certain amount of loss.Normally stars specially big stars doesn&#39;t do that but he did that and show his good side.Khans ke bas ki to Aisa karna bilkul bhi possible nahi hoga specially shahrukh and Salman khan ke bas ki to nai hogi Aisa kar pana because they only thinks about themselves not about the producer.

came here to watch irfan speak

Why is varun even included here. Bakwas actor

Ayushman told a fake thing and lie here that for starkids it is difficult to achieve a name and fame but for us the outsiders if we achieve the 50% then iska matlab isne kar diya.Actually the reverse is happen there in Bollywood always where starkids got each and everything very easily as compared to outsiders where only the outsiders struggles.Ayushman ne jhuth bola apne career ko bachane ke liye yahan.otherwise he knew that his career will also get spoil.

such a treat

Best roundtable ❤️❤️
The anchor is worst anchor i ever seen

I did not and am not going to watch this because Varun Dhawan is in it. I think he needs an acting class or he should look for jobs behind the camera. Ruined Sui Dhaga movie entirely, Rajkumar Rao would&#39;ve killed it in the role in Sui Dhaga. I don&#39;t understand what is wrong with casting directors.

Rajkumar Rao gave an example of Shahid, and Varun Dhawan used Badri&#39;s example. Still, Varun getting more time than Rajkumar to speak.

mark my words...Raj will be the next legend of indian cinema...❤❤❤...he carefully listens to everyone... doesn&#39;t speak unnecessarily

Love you Irrfan Sir

Vey jarraaaaa naaaaaz
Kamran sab laaaaaappppppeeein
What is Varun Dhawan doing here?
Varun Dhawan has made the biggest mistake in the roundtable.
Varun seems to be ODD ONE OUT 🤣🤣

*LESS BUT WORDS OF WISDOM *!!!

&quot; EMPTY VESSEL SOUNDS MUCH &quot;😀

Shakespeare ne to Irfan Khan ko bola Maqbool me tuney G..d faad di🤣

All of them are stupids

where did you go?
It&#39;s 2022 and what Irfan Sir said is happening. People are watching OTT like netflix, prime and have become more mature. His personality is so zen like. Legend!!

Irrfan is the brightest star in this group

It&#39;s like 🔥🔥🔥💩🔥
Fuck ads.

Irfan sir ❤️
Too bad I had to watch a show hosted by man who is known for writing blind items and for maligning names of good ppl

This is a sad coincidence, I don't know what it is, but at the same place where Irrfan Sir is sitting, Sushant Singh Rajput Bhai is also sitting in the same show, in some other episode, at the same place. Today both are not with us.
Rajkumar Rao is an intelligent nerdIrfan khan is a geniusAkshay kumar is hard workingAyushman khurana is talentedVarun  Dhawan is so wannabe !!!

Bouquet need to have a combination of beautiful flowers with probably one which is of least interest, and here we do have that Bouquet 💐. Anyways few years down the line I am sure Varun will realised where he should have shut up 🤐

<a href="">59:44</a> to <a href="">1:00:23</a> whatever Irrfan sir said is just the near reality I bet even big stars couldn&#39;t think of that time

Rajkumar only want to listen Akshay sir and irrfan sir&#39;s perception ..

Anyone watching in 2022

When ever askhay sir was talking he made every1 laugh with his story 😘

Only Two actors here Irfan khan &amp; Rajkumar rao.

Where did Varun stay?
Oh dear lord! Varun Dhawan doesn’t know when to shut up! One- He makes such little point. And sadly he doesn’t realise it. He thinks  blabbering is his entitlement!

Irfan sir ne sahi kaha that people will be watching films in Netflix......

love u all ❤ and missing u sir Irfan 😢

The way everyone listening to Khan sir so carefully, is very satisfying to see.

Irfan sir said right films that working today they will not work after 3to4 years

There is only one Irfan Khan !

why the helll varun is there?

What Varun dhawan doing in this table.. Any one had any Idea

Thank you for uploading such videos

Legend actor Irfan Khan We lost We really Miss you boss

<a href="">24:16</a> when rajkumar ask akshay u can see in his eyes how he wants to learn from akshay and respect him And Irfan sir will always remain alive in people hearts 💕

<a href="">14:45</a>  akshay laughing on himself

Just truth,One of the best moments<a href="">12:02</a>

Hindi me hona chahiye jb sb hindi film industry k actors h... Motu jada angreji sikh gya h
I am 5 years late but I will still give anything to see Akki, Sunil and Paresh Ji in another movie. I have grown up watching their movies. I laughed my a** off and still watch their movies when I am going through a bad day. I hope someday in the future they will come again for another mind-blowing movie.

I respect every actors who are on this table except for that coolie. He really is not a good actor, specially compares to the one he is setting with. Akshay is amazing. He is one of the very few actor who can do silly movie to funny movie to slice of life movie in one screen frame. Ifran sir is a legend. I miss him a lot. He had so much to give but gone too soon. Ayushmann, he is cool. Rajkummar Rao, I tried to watch all his movies because I love the way he portrays all his characters and his movies are good too with good story line.Kudos to all of them for being <b>so</b> amazing, except for the coolie.

Irfaan khan shab... ❤️❤️🙏🙏 Whole India miss you sir...
@<a href="">2:34</a> “crotch adjusting” ROFLLLLL 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
<a href="">5:30</a> - Irrfan Khan

Only for Akshay Kumar 🤘

It would have been more interesting if there would have been someone else instead of Varun. Like nawazuddin or manoj bajpai.

Some comments' are strange and those people forget Akshay Kumar. There is no need to learn anything from anyone, he is a class himself which no one can pass.
Akshay is so so witty 😂

Varun Dhawan talks too much. Alteast let us listen to real actors and their anecdotes.

<a href="">24:15</a> Akshay Kumar&#39;s acting process 😁😁😁
Three years down the lane <a href="">1:00:44</a> What Irfan sir said it&#39;s totally really in 2022 only Akshay Kumar has come up with a film and People are more into Netflix

Lovely video .... So enjoyable to watch. I really miss Irrfan Khan.... That poise and calm personality...

Irrfan 💙

watchedONLYforIRRFAN&amp;foundONLYworthyFORhin

BC Khali Hollywood ko copy karte raho

Watched this 20 times just for Akshay. Man, this guy is on another level of entertainment. He says Irfan just says his lines. But Akshay himself does effortless comedy that no one else matches.

What sweet voice ayushman has ❤️

At <a href="">5:32</a>, Irfan Khan: Mujhe sirf Maa ....😂 We all know what he&#39;s trying to say 😂😂

<a href="">1:00:38</a> 🤣... There is no danger to you
Varun doesn&#39;t deserve to sit among them

Rajiv has spoilt many lives.

The concentration on raj kumar’s face is just ✨immaculate✨

Varun has spoken so much yrrr.. he has irritated me.
<a href="">11:45</a>

Nawazuddin Siddhiqui should have been in place of Varun Dhawan.
Where are the actresses 🤔

<a href="">4:54</a> best line by great Irrfan khan sir..
Akshay comic timing and sense of humour is marvelous

Except rajkumar rao everyone bis talking
Where is sushant?

People in the comments are like no look at October Badlapur varun is a good actor bhai dekhi hn achae sae ghanta kuch achi acting nahi hn bus script achi thi he didn&#39;t do justice to his role

I found a resemblance in the faces of Akshay Kumar and Ayushmann

11.49 Akshay sir appreciating, Both Irrfan an Rajkumar Rao..Great People
But where are the actors

Many thinks that akshay is not good actor,acting is not only about serious roles only  few can match akshay in comic roles, comedy is also considered as acting, he is good in serious roles is well,watch rustam,baby,bell bottom,holiday,airlift, janwaar, yeah  irfan is better in serious roles but akshay is way ahead in comic roles so don&#39;t compare guys

Varun in k bich Kya kar Raha hai good for nothing

Watching Akshay sir he is so humble and down to earth i love his acting and in real life he is so good

So enjoyable to watch this! Miss Irfan though 😥

Odd man out: Varun Dhawan
Prabhas,yash,allu arjun ,rajjmouli and sukumar in a roundtable discussionAnd title would beBox office rulers of coming decade🔥🔥

Varun doesn&#39;t deserve to be on this panel. He is not on the same level as other actors here. Akshay so down to earth. No wonder he is very successful and has a long career in bollywood.

such a boring interview

I will never be able to do this with Kubrick.
Varun is just odd man out😑 couldn&#39;t he is invited for his  judwaa 2 movie

Varun shouldn&#39;t be in that place🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Who is this anchor speaking in so much English to make the VIP listen? Hadd ho gayi bhai, bhai we are from India and not from UK😁😁😁😁😁😁
I&#39;d like to thank Rajeev for this interview

Varun Dhawan is the odd one out of all these. I am really pissed 🤬😡. Why tge hell is he doing here among all these actors. The atmosphere of these talented is getting ruined.

<a href="">1:00:25</a> Irfann sir predicted... what will happen in 2021. It was true......

I still can&#39;t believe we lost this legend... Lots of love..... Lots of affection..... Tons of respect.... Love your Irfan sir....

Kia gand marai he jahan English ni aati wahan hindi boll rhe hein hindi hii bolo phr sirf yaan english hii bolo😡
<a href="">10:20</a>Irfan Saab be like: Haan pehle app karlo😡😡
Varun comes across as dumb
Why akshay kumar and varun dhawan are here in great actors

Woow irrfan sir....

Wth...what is Varun Dhawan doing here...🤨
Irfan khan is like the class topper whose secrets and triks every classmate wants t know

Akshays ability to show love to irfan and also really the whole table is amazing!

4 Gems around the table and one IronMan .. Lol

Irrfan Khan, Akshay Kumar and Rajkumar Rao 👑👑👑
<a href="">20:47</a>irrfan ji ne akshay ko troll kar diya😝<a href="">29:59</a> i was mesmerised by irrfan when suddenly this idiotic varun broke the beautiful      Communication

<a href="">1:01:34</a>Fav line from their movie

Am I the only one who thinks that this interview should have been in hindi....

Varun Dhawan why hey here
Irfan always...

Rajkumar Rao be like:- Where did you sit with the Buddha? Ayushman Varum Maze has made me sit here quietly.
Irrfan  💔💔💔
Ayushmann Khurrana
<a href="">51:30</a> the way Akshay laughed.... the heroine was Twinkle khanna 😅😅😅

<a href="">25:24</a>Rajkumar rao- irfan sir your process?Acche ki bhooki bhai ko.Acche actor ki baat sun raha hai.Varun to kewal bol raha.
Good discussion but would have loved to hear Irrfan more. Some of the actors on the table were trying to butter Akshay.Akshay is definitely very popular and a good actor but when it comes to acting there are very few people who can match Irrfan. Hate that some actors don&#39;t give due respect to Irrfan as he does not have mass popularity. When it comes to acting he is a legend.

When Varun gave that example of HSKD where he argued w the director over how there should be a makeout scene blah blah I got second hand embarrassment for him. Like why would you say that 😭😭😭

Varun har bar overacting Out Sushant singh rajput Sir ....( In )
Why Varun is invited ? Everyone else are amazing actors.

Varunardo DiCaprio has struggled a lot. Just look at his bat.
Legend predicted it before <a href="">1:00:30</a>Now we are seeing it happening

It&#39;s awesome this all we want back on again on this table

This episode is so good I regret not watching it before........and we audience really miss Irrfan sir and I m sure celebs too. Just see how these actors are listening to Irrfan sir, like they r in some classroom and a really great lecture is going on. Will miss irfan sir always ❤️

Varun bhai is saying too much...I am saying too much, listen too much!
Everything is fine why varun Dhawan is there

Men are handling the interview with more class as compared to female actress in the other interview of round the table who are just interrupting each other and doing all the talking instead of listening to senior actress.

Irfan sir, I can watch you all my life, I have saved 2 of your movies, I have not seen that movie, I feel that the day I watch that movie, Bollywood will end for me, that day there will be nothing left.
Varun talking about feeling the spirituality in his scripts...meanwhile me trying to find spirituality in judwaa 2 and main tera hero😂😂

I love ayushman
We miss you irfan sir..😭😭😭😭😭
Irrfan sir is real one😢

Why Rajkumar&#39;s question , shifted to Varun ? He was about to answer ...

I like varu the way he is

Everyone is coughing to let know that they are going to speak less except Irfan, this video is a great case study to study body language

Varun Dhawan kitna bolta hai be ??????❤️
Varun Dhawan should listen to gem,... Look at raj and ayush grasping the experience of veterans... Miss irfaan sir❤

All n alone came here for irfan khan sir ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
rajkumar is a great learner

wtf varun is doing here , even more shittiest thing is he is here for judwaa 2

Irrfan Khan Sahab go quickly
Who knew on earth that IRFAN would leave us

<a href="">55:21</a> Legacy gg
With all due respect Varun, plzz forget your dad brother your copied hits judwaa and all for a while. We are here to hear something that is to be acknowledged. And plzz let the legends speak and hear them for a while. they have definately times more hits than you but they are not mentioning their movies here. Its all about legendary talks and we want to hear that.                   Definately i appreaciate your acting skills, I love u, your movies but sorry to say that this is not koffee with karan. As your well wisher just want to request and suggest you to learn something from those newcomers rajkumar rao and aayushmaan khuraana as compared to the legends how u r supposed to be behaving.     Otherwise, appreciating you, all lots of love from NEPAL

RIP Irfan Sir

1 :00: the best prediction by Irfan and it&#39;s come true now people want goOd cinema not typical cinema

I don&#39;t understand where does varun dhawan fit in?...except him they are all self established people

You know very well that 55% population live in village I want know from you can you speak in Hindi

Why Varun Dhawan was there?

Why varun dhawan is there?

Why Varun is seated in this circle...?All are talented and self made actors...

Why are people unnecessarily hating on Varun Dhawan . He seems very mature and normal here .

Uploaded in Hindi Are you from Hindustan or are you from England?
Nobody wanted to know about badri and badrinath ki dulaniya...

<a href="">6:06</a> I just Laughed at it, I don&#39;t wanna be But it just came 😂😂😂😂.Ye kya hi bolega Struggle aur Acting k baare main 😂

Bahubali also likes the film, Karan Johar is the producer, what kind of mother does he make people like?
<a href="">01:00:31</a>Very Well Said &amp; True Irfan SirFilms Are not working..✌️

30.01 pe sahi baat bta rahe the irfan bhai, tok diye

Varun was thinking what should I say?
BadlapurDam laga k hyshashadi mein zaror anamadariand gabbar is backmy favorite movies of these actors

Too many addssss

Liked just because Akshay and irfan

Varun d like Kedar Yadav in csk
I m huge akshay sir fan but right now i really missing irfan sir and his acting and simplicity.

varun be like, aa log sab kya keh raha hai, saab ke top ke damag se raha hai !🙄
I like all of them but love the acting of irfan and Rajkummar so realistic. Rajkummar is the only one who is here to learn something.

Why is Varun Dhawan here brother?
only here for chakki canadian kumar

I don&#39;t what varun doing between all good actors.

Always miss irfan khan 🌹🌹🌹
Where did this Dhawan come from? It ruined my mood.
<a href="">#IRRFAN</a>

The best round table in a long time …

Rest in Peace the great Irfan Khan

Why Varun is sitting around this table.. 🤔🤔🤔

Why ayushmann is talking like in a very minimal tone🤷‍♂️
Why ayushmann is talking like in a very minimal tone🤷‍♂️
Ok where are the actors 🤣🤣

John o

John

If you put video title in emojis:🐐🐐🐐🐕‍🦺🐐
from stones.. 😂😂
what a great observer irfan was ..... he is absolutely right at <a href="">1:00:30</a>...hats off man

Varun ko kyu bithaya beech mr

<a href="">1:00:32</a> Irrfan Khan predicted right wowBut akshay rejected it lol

This entire conversation between both experienced and upcoming actors is just great 💗♥

Varun Dhawan doesn&#39;t belong there.

<a href="">55:41</a> he said i am not khan , I am just irrfan  and he meant that .

<a href="">55:25</a> thoughts on legacy

<a href="">46:30</a> child&#39;s bringing up

Ever since Varun has been the best performing actor?
<a href="">14:50</a> Akshay kumar funnny scene
Varun, where did you come from?
Its oct 28th 2021, still missing Irrfan 😢

Varun doesn&#39;t deserve to  be on that table

Whether acting is an Expensive Hobby or Part of  Academia is a Timely question, where most of our Society has no Geniune discussion about the Subject. What I know for Sure is Cinema has reached their Golden Era.

<a href="">1:00:30</a> Well its 2021 and he is God Damn Right!! Just that this guy isnt around, this time was suppossed to be his.😭😭

Actor&#39;s are double face individuals , Fake People.  👎

Aayushman is the only perfect balance of art and commercial!

Lol what the hell is Varun doing here 😂

Just to identify difference, I take this portion of &#39;Round the table&#39; when they are asked abt a line frm their performance that has stayed with them; Sir Irrfan remembers the essence of lines and all others are saying sentences, thats one of the examples how Irrfan sir&#39;s approach is towards his work on craft and how others go. To simplify, Its all about internal, not external.

Waiting for this round table:Manoj bajpayeeNawajuddin siddiqueNasirddun Shah,Pankaj TripathiK k Menon,Raj Kumar Rao

A wise man speaks the least, Irfan Sir ❤️🙏
Have u gone mad rajiv masand....how can u heap praise on judwa 2 actor varun dhawan.....it was slapstick comedy with bad performance.....it was just another typical Bollywood movie....chutiya ho gaya hai masand.

The bond between Irrfan and Akshay here is so beautiful to watch! ❤️

Watching this interview hits different now

It’s good that Rajkumar was constantly intrigued to know the process of Irfan’s acting💗

What Varun is doing here

Never seen Akshay show so much respect for anyone else as irffan khan

Missing mr irfaan. Khan
<b>Logical reasoning question:-</b><b>Pick the odd one out.</b>

why is varun Dhawan even there

Exactly that&#39;s what happened after 3 years 😳 ( <a href="">1:00:30</a> ) irrfan knew it before 🔥

Varun is sooo respectful❤️❤️👍
Varun is outsider here 😂

varun should have gone for marketing... acting is not his cup of tea

IRFAN KHAN 😭😭😭❤❤❤
actors bullshit alot

bhai sab kuch thik h all are very talented n irfan is lagend  .but varun kya kar raha h

Why Varun is there? Doing Judwaa 2 film? 😂 Wth ..  how he is even telling how he chooses scripts (hilarious)

Ajj pata chala varun dhawan actor vi hyy
Still missing IRFAN SIR R.I.P. SIR
IRRFAN IS SO TRUE NOW AFTER THREE YEARS ALL THE NEPOTASIM GONE AND PEOPLE ARE DIVR TO WORDS OTT EVEN MOVIES AND SHOWS ARE PREM ON OTT PLATFORMS

What&#39;s varun dhawan is doing in between legendary actors ?😂

😘😘😘😘😘

You are not an actor Irfan sir, you are a Legend..... You are immortal.

What is this guy doing here?
5 best chairs ❤️
Varun is odd choice as compare all above of them.

Akshay Kumar be like… Ye log ki bol rahe hain, paisa chaapo or go ghar jao
❤️ Irfan Khan
Bollywood Hindi movies interview in English wow bhai wow👏👏👏👏👏
Why are people so crazy about bahubali? The cgi is really pathetic and so many scenes are extremely cringey..its just mass hysteria..

Irrfan Khan❤️✨
No one talking about varun dhavan why 😂

@<a href="">1:00:30</a> little did He know that in the next 3 years He won&#39;t be there

This country will not have another Irrfan Khan! The best actor India has ever produced. Its extremely sad to know that we wont get to see him again

Varun Dhawan doesn't shine as much as he used to.
Mr Khan could share his seen from Khakee

@<a href="">1:00:30</a> it has been three years.. and he has been proved right

Paan Singh Tomar...a movie I can watch again and again ...miss you Irfan.

I wish we would have seen Irfan sir in more films. I so much miss him today after seeing him it feels like sir, leash aap hote, Kash humlog aapke aur films dekh paate, seekh paate, apki sarhana karte. He is genuine, so natural, so pure. He should not have gone so soon. 🤷 miss you Irfan sir.

Irfan sir really miss you 😭

Brother, who did you leave between these 4 actors?
Ohh really..!!🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱😱<a href="">
Very different atmosphere as compared to the actress roundtable.

I love varun dhawan
Varun does so many retakes whereas pthers disagree,showing the real acting skills,don&#39;t require much takes🤣🤣

Akshay showing how confident he is,just by wearing a tracksuit,hats off.

I hate this reporter

Cant find any actors..

Nobody wants to listen varun lol... And he is not getting that

Salman Khan be like: Itna kuch karna patta hai.
<a href="">24:16</a> 😂😂😂😂

Irrfan  sir said at <a href="">1:00:33</a> About future of industy in next 3 yearsAnd bang we are here (2021) 4 years laterSame thing is happeningMany people have shifted from the no Brainer masala films and million views wala musicMan had a vision!🙏Itni aasani se aur bina koi insecurity ke irrfan sir ne khud actor hoke bhi public ki tarh yeh baat boldiEnd me Akshay ko Industry ki taraf se bolna pad gaya ,inko business jo karna he logon ko bevkoof banake&#39;Kehte he audience ko mat bolo ke tum mature ho gaye ho&#39;Kya matlab iska!!True artist Irrfan sir.Jinko logon ke baare me pata tha aur respect karte the ke log kya chahte he

most of the Indian actors don&#39;t kno english. feel so pity on them.what kind of English does the akshya have, a candian citizen?😂

Why is Varun here? I mean compared to the other, he hasn&#39;t done much. Nawazuddin should have been invited. Even Sid Malhotra was a better choice than Varun.

Irfan khan legend RIP
Irffan, Rest in Peace, Sir.

Why Varun

<a href="">50:30</a>... Girl's circle babu bhaiya ???
Varun is very down to earth

Except Varun....all came from non filmy background and they are self made....thats the beauty.

Alia Bhatt is like this because of Varun Dhawan or Varun Dhawan is like this because of Aaliya Bhatt
How big of a actor irfan was u can realise when Raj and everyone started asking him the questions about acting

Varun Dhawan what is he doing here?
There was only one Irfan khan. One of best actor  I have ever seen.

This is the best round table till date!!!

Varun's place will be given to Siddharth/Karthik/Vikrant Messi.
Can we have such a round table conference with industry&#39;s actresses too!!

In this interview there are two most experienced actor and two who are going to be experienced actor soon and there is one who is trying to be a actor but he is unable to 😂😂😂

Everyone is talented except that fucking talentless dhawan

Where is Shahid Kapoor?
Akshay &amp; Irrfan ❤️
Varun wasn&#39;t needed here

Shut up rajeev let pepole complete 😤
Irrfan Khan sitting besides Varun, that&#39;s an insult. I mean why Varun?

Miss you irfan khan
Varun dhawan is looking like a 5th standard boy sitting with all college boys.

Almost good choices of actors .

Varun i think is outsider comparing other 4 legend actors🤣

Believe me or not , shahrukh / salmaan /aamir literally do not belong to this table , these are pure 5 legends praising each other !! I admire all of them

Only actor who had established his presence here andnin Hollywood was Irfan sir.. Still the most modest one. That guy was and will always be a legend. Loved all his movies especially Lunchbox, Pan Singh, Piku etc.. Loved him on screen.

In the whole interview I observed 3 things 1) Irrfan dressing😍..osm yrr ..2)the way akshay treat the irrfan ..and how akshay and raj sees the irrfan ...it was adorable ..3) the thinking of irrfan ..his way of speaking, calmness ...He is just simply amazing ...

<a href="">29:58</a>.... irfan sir❣️❣️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Raj Kumar rao was a better interviewer.  He was primarily interested in what irfan Khan had to say.

<a href="">6:12</a> he is lying

Irfaan was damn right! After 3-4 yrs. Indian audience won&#39;t accept your crap... They ll have their own mind... Choices ❤❤❤

90% of women doesn&#39;t use sanitary pads!? Like what he just said 🤣🤣🤣 ❌❌
&#39;I&#39;m not khan i m just irfan&#39; I think varun didn&#39;t get the meaning in it ...  But It has a big sense

And I am feeling very funny that Akshay and Varun have to act like this as they themself are always very funny humurous character

Brother, who placed Varun Dhawan among these legends?
Irfan khan... Akshay wow
Legends Irfan Khan, Rajkumar Rao &amp; Ayushmann Khurrana. The remaining 2 are tapori… one is doing chapsuli waali movies and the other one is doing overacting.
Irfan sir ❤️🙏
4 national award winners and 1 chuttiya actor.

<a href="">1:00:44</a> 😂 Akshay said it ….Bollywood in danger now , people not happy what Bollywood give them .

Irfan khan:- it’s so boring earning money for shake of money, wow, miss you man, we had always admire your acting and you will be always in our memories, love from nepal…

Aadmi jab tak haarta nahin, tab tak woh jeeta hua rehta hai..... Akshay s, one of the best lines

Canada kumar favorite line is aap aam kaise kate hai
You should invite Manoj Bajpai

Akshay Kumar is legend 😂😂😂

ache acho m ek chakke ko zaroor bula lete h jase varun ko bula lia isme 😂😂

what varun is doing between this gems?

If Language was in hindi.... It must better

Justice for ssr

Y they place varun over there. 🤭

<a href="">24:30</a> akshay sir
Why is varun even on this table ?? A bit disrespectful to the other people on the table ... 😑😓😑

Irrfan absolutely true legend 👌🏻 this interview gets so uplifted bcoz of him

E

I have tears in my eyes when I am looking irfan sir....!!! You was such a nice and true person ...

Varun should have spoken less.. he is speaking as if he is an great actor, infact I wonder what makes Rajeev Masand to invite Varun Dhawan amongst such talented group  of people.Nothing against Varun but he doesn&#39;t fit into this elite group of artists.He is making things worse by talking more and intervening constantly. Varun has a say in everything just fast forwarding whenever he speaks... ngst self made man their is a flag bearer of Nepotism spoiling the entire discussion.Rajkumar and Ayushman spoke Logic , intellect and seems respectful towards Akshay and Irfan.Akshay sir and Irfan sir thoroughly enjoyed their talks.. very mature and yet funny.Instead of Varun had it been Pankaj Tripathi or Nawazudin Siddiqui..Amo

Varun isn&#39;t capable of sitting with even Rajeev Masand let alone the others like Irfan, rajkumar, akshay

Rajkumar is learning..from legends..

I hope to see pankaj tripathi and akshay kumar together. May be in a movie as well

Akshay Kumar Canada merchant navy hotel 🤣🤣
Abe yeh varun sala in talented logon ke bich kaise baitha hai. Yeh na hota tho kitna acha hita, sala irritation hota hai isko dekh ke

I liked this video for Irfan khan

Irfan sir

Odd one out  : varun dhawan….All are great actors n he is just hopeless

Varun should&#39;ve become a youtuber

varun dhawan sitting among best actors 🤣 he must be feeling like a outsider 🙂

<a href="">1:00:31</a> Irfan predicted future

Who is keeping Varun here?
I don't know who to look for... woo man this big ball is still there :D
Akki the true king of bollywood

Why is Varun Dhawan visible?
Why do these round tables  always has one immature actor always interupting others.. even with the women..

Instead of varun there should be one from among srk or nawazuddin Siddiqui or Pankaj Tripathy or manoj bajpai🙂

Plz arrange directors round table

What is varun dhawan doing at this table??? Yah per nepotism???Should have been vicky kaushal instead of him!!!!

For those who are saying that why varun is here just watch his performance in BADLAPUR, SUI DHAGA

I heard Everyone except varun...because whenever he speaks,,, he talks shit

The way akshay sir &amp; irrfan sir respect each other ...I love it ...ek outsider hi dusre outsider ke sturrgle &amp; success dono ko janta hai ...both r legend ❤️❤️

Akshay sir is so down to earth &amp; make comfortable everyone &amp; he don&#39;t behave like a megastar ...he behave like he is only actor ....great respect sir ❤️

Nepotism

Irfan sir said very true line before 3 years that - after 3 years people choose Netflix above us!!! - he was the legend and  Astrologist

Sir mere pass work nhi bacha ....I m berozegaar... Let me allow some work

akshay sir is talking about whom in <a href="">57:50</a>???

Dude why the thing is Varun could have been good actor among them only but the matter is he got too much advantages in his career that made him eye sore as a nepo kids. His few films like October and Badlapur was amazing....he could have talk about those movies....but no he has to talk about those shitty movies which he got due to his being nepo kid...

I have loved Irfan sir so much..I wish i could just meet him hug him and tell him how much influence he has created in me 😭

Without ss?

please delete varun&#39;s scenes, tried of skiping.

Lovely 👌 experience
E varun actor hain

Omgg that lines said by irfan khan..about legacy.that no one is gonna remember you...and I am watching this episodes after his death..then after few sec I realised he also left us...how strange..is life...and but now I also realised why he said that..😭...Rip legend....

<a href="">1:00:36</a> Irfan sir was a visionary,Cause that&#39;s what we are doing today.

Irfaan that’s it for me

Sushant key pass is all zero
Miss irfan so much that I keep coming back to watch this video. Just to hear him out one more time

Can someone make a list of times Varun speaks so we can forward his part and watch the rest ?

Jst imagine how boring this episode will be without akshay kumar.

Wait.. Varun on actors roundtable for wht?? Judwaa 2???Like why??

I hate when varun starting talking about acting and Ayushman and rajkumar was silent rip Irfan sir 😭😭😭😭

What the Fuck Varun Dhawan is doing there??? Ab Ghodo ki race mai gadhe bhi daudenge??

I think everyone has found out the odd one out 😜

Why did l listened Sambit Patra’s voice at the start of this video 🥴🤪😂

Omg why Varun ..

They all r my fav except varun

Why is Varun dhawan even there ....😂😂 He&#39;s not even an actor😂😂😂

Leave the acting ...but Varun is such a nice person and i observed he always respect others!!!

Varun is so irritating

Why is Varun Dhawan among actors

I hate this Rajib masand

So happy to watch some of the best actors of bollywood together. Just one thing is bothering me, why invite Varun Dhawan for Judwaa 2. I like Varun Dhawan and I think he was fantastic in movies like October, Badlapur and Sui Dhaaga. But Judwaa 2 !!???

Lets be honest whenever varun spoke we all skipped!

Varun Dhawan was here for Judwaa 2 (as mentioned in the description). Just let that sink in.

After watching recent movies of Irrfan khan I would say he is the best actor in Hindi industry.

Varun Dhawan - Cool Nober
Varun here is like a black peppernin bowl of halwa!!

Varun seems like ilaychi in biryani
Wtf is varun doing here?!!

Varun why .. why .. why..  god. I really attention seeking

It was painful to watch varun.. and I was one who love varun in soty over Siddarth.

Why is varun here ?

Akshay and varun don’t belong here

<a href="">59:53</a> so true.... 👍
<a href="">56:27</a>❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel bad for poor Varun fans, apart from Badlapur and October, there is nothing else to worry about.
Wait!! What is Varun doing in  between these talented actors???? 🤔🤔

kudos to Akshay kumar, for addressing irrfan khan as Sir, tho their age is same

I have only heard the legend Irfan Khan Sahab, he is the pride of our Rajasthan.
Varun just wants to yak like a 8yr old &quot;Papa, Xbox abhi lekar aao mere liye&quot;, others are good at listening.

&quot;I never thought that I will become an actor &quot;  50 saal purana ghisapita sentence

Varun acted well in October and Badlapur

Akki the king

Varun itna bich me kyu bolta hai

<a href="">05:32</a> Akshay is the only one who didn&#39;t laugh at Irrfan khan. He knows the pain

<a href="">25:02</a> But Varun Dhawan didn't give it to me ???
judwa and coolie were worst movie acted by varun

irfan best actor
Varun is so talented but his choice of films is bad.. he should stop doing his dad&#39;s films

Varun was beaten and I was spoiled.
Who has brought this?
Kya woh wala? Bhai Varun Dhawan i Don’t know how you were selected to sit next to Irfan Khan.

What a talented actors rajkumar,khan and ayush,but hit heros akshay and dhawan,gems of bollywood ❤️

Sir IRRFAN ❤️🙏
The whole mood got worse when I saw Varun.
<a href="">12:43</a> learn something from Irfan bhai.  Salman khan and Varun always do same acting in their every film😂 chutiye actor.

Why is Varun Dhawan sitting like this...he is picking the odd one out.
see i will tell u something guys varun dhawan is an amazing actor.i also thought he is an overrated actor but after watching the film october  i became a like a big fan of varun. Go watch october he is an amazing actor.i think if he choosw correct films he will be the next superstar. He has talent

Loved this one bring more actor one&#39;s ☹

Varun Dhawan be like Main kaha agaya ! 😂 legends ke beech main  Main kaha agaya ! But han Badlapur is only the one Picture I like ! Rest all are 😂😂

<a href="">51:14</a>

Rajeev masand is 11 year younger than Akshay

Not medium 😁😁😁
How the hell varun made his way to this conference?

M sure these men finished every bit of the dishes kept unlike ladies round table... leaving it untouched

It was very knowledgeable to listen them, i would have imagine that they shoild be more. I would like to say about Irfan Khan Saab he said that after 3 years people will be watching Netflix and that whats exactly happening.  It shows how legendary he was I wish he could have stay with us more. Still always love you Sir and all the actors in this interview. Thank you for all who made this effort to present this to us. ♡

Varun dhawan ko le aye beech me ??? so unfit here.
Varun gave few good points but people just hate him as he works in commercial films only

The roundtable is like😎😎😎💩😎

Varun is king of over acting...throw him somewhere else

Irfan khan is a legend.. why varun is there in between those skilled actresses

<a href="">8:19</a> the most honest and meaningful answer!

Why Varun Dhawan? Ohh, Nepo Effect!!

It&#39;s very hard to believe that I will not able to watch him in movies, interviews, in real life and every possible tangible surrounding around him.  The one person I was ( i will always be) always mesmerized and looked forward to listen to him. I think there is no point in putting adjective before his name. The name is itself enough to call it as Class apart &quot;The Irrfan  Khan Shaab&quot;. I wish he was here with us and the worst is that I don&#39;t want to believe  that he is no more as a Tangible person but ya intangibly he will be there forever with us. I truly feels the Goosebumps when he speaks every single time. Hats off to u Sir And as his loved ones, if haven&#39;t checked &#39;Tokyo Trial&#39;, u can watch a genius in his aura.

What does Varun Dhawan do among actors?
Varun Dhawan is saying :- bhai kyaa baat kar rehe hai

Having Varun among these actors especially Irfan was shamefully at best

Why there is Varun Dhawan ?

Sushaant had to be on this table if Ayushmaan and Rajkumaar were there.

Iss actors round table mai varun kya kar raha hai

What is this Canadian and Dhawan's son doing?
Best part is a heroine teaching dance to govinda .and see the reaction all of

I don&#39;t know what akshay and varun are doing there😂😂😂😂

Irrfan sir is the best actor amongst them May he rest in peace❤️

Gandu Varun interrupted at <a href="">30:00</a> and spoiled it.
I&#39;ve observed the comment section..People praising akshay are akshays fansPeople praising varun are teenagers crazy about varunPeople praising Irfan and Rajkumar are people who appreciate great acting and true talent

Rajkumar is a keen learner

What is varun doing here 😑

Ayushman has been kept in the sets for a while now.
Who brought Varun Dhawan here, he is disturbing you.
Why can&#39;t you do it in hindi?

Why Varun dhawan is sitting with them 🤔

Varun is like a friend. He doesn't hold his own opinion..
Akshay irfan Ayushman n rajkumar rao they are comes for their actind skill bt Varun Dhawan dumb actor

<a href="">1:00:27</a> He predicted that, and now it is happening

🙏If you are reading this and you are an aspiring professional ACTOR I wish and hope and pray you have worldwide success!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💛

Why varun dhawan is there??

Korean

Varun dhawan 😊😊😊
Can&#39;t believe man Irfan saab is no more. Just one meeting with him would have made my day. From now lets all come together and ask him sir irrfan

<a href="">57:54</a> I think Dev Anand

Superb. v inspired
Varun here is like &#39;Elaichi&#39; in Biryani.

I have watched this episode so many times and i always thought why Varun? I always wanted to watch Irrfan Sahab, Sanjay sir, Pankaj ji, Nawaz bhai, Rajkumar sir, Manoj Bajpayee sahab, and Ayushman sir on a screen together ❤️ but now it could never happen.. You will always be misses Irrfan Sahab coz, legends never die

1 - Irfan2 - akshay3 - Raj4 - Anushman5 - Varun
After 3 years many things changed hunh

David Dhawan is one of the three best director in india.. seriously..??? Good joke..😂😂😂

Varun ko kyun bulaya tha....rajeev..karna kya chahte ho....best conversations ka cocktail ban gaya😉😭😭..The most intelligent guys like Irfaan and Rajjkumar  are most silent...and most charming Akshay sir were giving more space.... everybody respecting Akshay cos of superstar label and Akshay respecting God of acting Irrfan is humbleness and amazing!!

Roundtable ache talented actors ko bulata h magr ek chutiya starkid jrur rkhta h hmesha

Varun Dhawan Just waaakk thuuuuu

Who put Varun here??? He doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here. He is just throwing stones in dark.

Everybody talked about Bahubali.... a 2017 biggest film of India... But no one from the film was called for interview.

Rajeev Masand doesn&#39;t get any other industry actors....... He is bound to Bollywood only...

Ooo

Varun dhawan talking about scripts 😆😆
IRRFAN, IRRFAN AND JUST IRRFAN❤❤
Why does varun again interrupt others and speak in between

I really liked Rajkumar, he said only wherever needed and whatever asked to him. His respect was showing towards every actor. To know much about your crafts and you have an experiences and thoughts. You got succes and you want to tell everyone about your thoughts. Its a feeling like to influence others through your journey and to control yourself is very difficult. When you really want to tell. That thing i sawed in Rajkumar...❤And I also try control on myself.

Pls make a film with Akshay and varun

They all are My Favorites🤗🤗🤗
What happens to the food on the table?

Whenever VARUN open his mouth I wanted to slap him

First question is not for Varun so plz don&#39;t answer

Why varun dhwan here.। 😂
There is one imposter among us!

Listening to Varun and in the back of the mind remembering that he&#39;s here for Judwaa 2😶😶

Why sushant is not there as he was more established one than Varun dhawan and rajkumar rao

If Varun Dhawan was there for October, I would have agreed

What is Varun Dhawan doing on this table?

All great actors 🥺❤️Varun also
Akki what a simple guy🥺💗Asia's biggest actor is also listening to his juniors with respectLove you man🥺💗☺️
Why are there no female actors ever on this show?

Bhai varun pehli baat to judwa bht hi tatti movie thi. So itna khush mat ho uska naam le le k baar baar. You can&#39;t compare your judwa to their movies !

Varun tumko sirf tumhare dad used to say only not anyone else used to tell 🤣🤣🤣 for anything u r not self made u r made by your daddy.

Akshay 😍😂🤣bete😂😂irfan 😍🥰😘😊😇
Ayushmaan acting as aayushi...
Irrrrrfannnnn! You beauty!
Irrfan Akkhi Raj Aaiushman 🤦🤦🤦 Varun
When anyone hug irrfan .Thay are like grabbing Talent

Irrfan irrfan irrfan irrfan . only for him .

Who will tie Varun's mouth?
nobody acknowlede the ignorence and bad mental status of varun, for him if he has drunk girl with him, he has right to her. it might sound simple but this kind of behaviour is bad. teach men that if a girl is drunk be reponcible friend and take care , as u do to your male friend. looser

Not a single thing what Varun said made any sense...!

Irrfan Khan❤️
Blocked

Akashy only listening to irfaan

What varun is doing here 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Why are people being so mean towards mean VD? He is being so respectful towards everyone. He’s So sweet and funny. Throughout the interview he says such cute and relatable things are everyone laughs in a good way. I  love everyone in this interview. Guys please don’t hate Na. Love you guys so much ❤️

👏... To All
Mute varun dhawans part its irritation..

Irrfan Khan💔💔
Upsc qualified with one lateral entry

My expression exactly @ <a href="">22:38</a> every time varun opened his mouth

Varun is bad actor

Varun Dhawan 🙄🙄🙄Why

The way Akshay making irfan comfortable is so adorable ❤️

<a href="">53:26</a> hit hard
Akki is a legend

I really appreciate Akshay for reminscing Irrfan and rajkumar acting skills their craft ....... They are worth it.

<a href="">23:02</a> here rajkumar is talking about how he prepared for Shahid.Varun Dhavan immediately after that <a href="">23:33</a> follows up with badri ki dulhaniya. What a moron.. 😂

Varun is sounding fuddu

What is Varun Dhawan doing here?
I liked this video just for IRRFAN

Seriously? Judwa 2 belongs on the same pedestal as shubh mangal sawdhan, toilet and hindi medium? Like an honorary mention? Guess life is never fair.

I would have eaten the food on the table.

Ayushmann was my junior at St John&#39;s High School, Chandigarh. We are proud of him, creative powerhouse.

Irrfan asking there were many questions in my mind will people accept me as an actor. Sir Humara bas chalta toh aap kabhi iss duniya se jaate hi nahi 🙏🏽❤️

Varun is lol

I only here for irfan sir

<a href="">12:18</a> 👌👌
I miss my favorite Late Irrfan Sir❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
what is varun dhavan doing here?
Q.  Find the odd one out.Ans. Varun Dhawan

<a href="">29:58</a> Kya soch k Varun ko bulaya aur kya to soch k wo aaya... 🤪Even akshay is trying to behave 😜<a href="">33:00</a> But Varun 🤣<a href="">34:53</a> esa hi fuddu host 🙄

Varun Dhawan with these talented actors Rajkumar,Ayushmann,Akshay and the legend sir irfan khan is like “kahan raja bhoj,kahan gangu teli”.

Why is Varun here?!

Why is judwa 2 here?? Worst movie

Finest three actors. Irfan , Ayushman and rajkumar👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Look at Rajkumar, looks like he is in a acting class with Irfan and Aksay sir....thus he is a brilliant actor♥️❤️♥️

why is varun dhawan there among these fine actors🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">1:00:34</a> &quot;People will be watching it on Netflix&quot; - Irfan Khan

Raj is like pure fan boy of Irrfan!

Varun is not a good listener

love you irfan sir...😊😊😊😊
I wanted To Know  About  arushi Talvaar&#39;s Case And I watched His Film I was Like From That Film I got whole Clearity That&#39;s The powerr of IRRFAN and Script.💯

Best Thing about Irrfan That He himself don&#39;t he such a Great Actor.♥️

Varun is Such a Good Guy.I will Suggest Him To stop Being With Shitty Bollywood People And sit with Goof Ones.💯

Everyone is speaking in English except Irfan sir he is speaking little bit Hindi although he can talk in English better than anyone else. He is so so calm and positive. What a personality he has. Love this man from the bottom of my heart ❤️

Varun is only nepo kid I like a bit

Honestly Rajkumar is true fan of Irrfan  he literally analysed and connected with his movies

A man he who should be able to eat spice.

Don&#39;t know about others but Sushant deserved more than varun to be a part of this round table.

Varun dhawan is looking so cute and chubby♥️

Varun is the ilaichi in the biryani..

<a href="">2:30</a> kya beizzati kya sir.....wah🤣🤣🤣 bhigoke hura mara lol
I like how rajkumar wants to know the process of akshay sir and irrfan sir....... To akshay.... Sir aapkaTo irrfan.... Sir aapka

What is Varun Dhawan doing here 😡😡😡😡
Sab thik h but I don&#39;t like Varun dhawan&#39;s overacting ..... But baaki sare actors are just mind blowing and versatile 😍

Title says &quot;actors roundtable&quot; and then i saw Varun dhawan.......galati sabse hoti hai

And I am watching it 3years later

Itne  good actors ke bich me varun  kya kar raha h😜😜

Varun Dhawan bro you are irritating

best roundtable line up...
Don&#39;t troll Varun guys ....he himself says he is idiot and we agree with u varun 👍👍

Miss the legend irrfan khan so much.😢😢😢🥺

<a href="">55:43</a> best
<a href="">1:00:30</a> a true Genius. He predicted it so perfectly at that time .😱

<a href="">18:16</a>

Roleconfusion Vs identity

Why this masand is so obsessed with alia and varun. Everytime they are there in this interview.And varun you are so extra in this interview

<a href="">1:00:33</a> - Irfan predicted future which has became real last year after covid.

What is dancer varun doing here 🤔

When Irfan sir starts to speak  ... then all the everyone have become silent ...🥰🥰

Varun hasn&#39;t earned his place at the table yet.

ancor is so disturbing

Man the ayushman is just Blah blah ...At the least give the other guys To talk also...Soemtimes u just have to listen as well...

Akshay is like wat they saying!

Irrfan always looks like fulfilled/Complete..the way he sits, looks..So complete

Even after 4 years, me:-Varun, where did you come from and what am I??
Miss irrfaan so much
Don&#39;t like varun
Varun is right example for “ why you should listen more and talk less, especially when surrounded by legends “ like Irrfan Khan..

m so fucking surprised varun dhawan is here because of judwa 😂😂

Varun Dhawan in this roundtable. I mean like seriously?😳

Rajiv masand the biggest dalal of bollywood

Actors round table with akshay and varun

Rajkumar Rao is hanging on to every word of legendary Irrfan Khan. Trying to learn as much as possible. Such an amazing quality.

Dont you feel Varun is like elaichi in briyani

Hey God, reservation here too
Rajkumar Rao , sounds like , Ranbir Kapoor

Akshay And Irfaan sir are just awesome. But Varun ko criticise krne walo...acting chahe jaise v ho....bnde ki personality dekho...sabke sath involve hota h...sabko respect deta h...and ek calm environment create krta h...tum real life mein ek aise hi bnde k aas pass rehna chahoge

I am fan of all of them, of varun dhavan as well, I don&#39;t know he is a good actor or not but I feel he is a good person.

I think varun Ki jagah yaha shushant sir ko hona chaia ta

Varun&#39;s introduction 😂😂😂

Rip Irfan khan
<a href="">18:48</a> Ayushman trolling varun Dhawan over nepotism
Irfan: I am not Khan, I am just Irfan.Akshay: Ye add ho gaya tere legacy mein.👏🏻

Om shanti 🙏✝🤲️
<a href="">1:00:30</a> bang on 👍
What is Varun doing here? Who told him?
Why warundhawan

Varun Dhawan ....The perfect 💙✨

Varun dhawan trying to sound smart and trying to make others believe that he belongs there.

LOL Why Varun Dhawan is there?

Legend _irrfanActor _rajkumarVarun no one can say anything
Only for Akshay Kumar sir❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Has anyone noticed that he is a method actor, he is serious, he does not smile much, Irfan sir, Navajudin, Rajkumar, look at anyone, what can be the reason why he plays such a character, his effect is due to method acting. a little
Irfan Sir is the King of Acting but Ayushmaan has not studied Acting classes but this guy is also in the Singing Zone, Mtlb Ayushman is not less talented than Rajkumar and it is not necessary to be on top in any department. I will have to take his classes for this. Why do men go to the top even on their own? Because man learns more from experience. No, he will learn more from teaching. Varun Dhawan is also a good man but here no one is making fun of him because he is so bad. Varun is not a good person and he will become a good actor in future. Or Akshay sir did not take any acting class but in comedy films no one is his equal. Mtlb human being learns more from his own experience.
Irrfan the, hain, aur rahenge !!We miss you Irrfan !!!

News
This can be the one of memorable achievement of Varun Dhawan to share the table with these great ones.

<a href="">22:00</a> What Varun is saying here is that he is not himself 🤣
Why Varun ? Agar koe star kid nahi rakhanga to problem ho jayga!!!In 2018 none of them present 👍

Where did this struggler (Varun Dhawan) come from?
Even Akshay Kumar don&#39;t how big superstar he is.. Just see how humble he is. He is genuinely praising irfan khan and even rajkumar rao.

Most annoying thing in this is varun dhawn with these actors.And second annoying thing is Akshay kumar&#39;s fake accent.Rao,khan and khurranna are perfect.

Likes for candid Irfan khan!!
Varun dhawan has left the chat

Believe me or not I will literally vote for Rahul Gandhi if someone can tell me what&#39;s Varun Dhawan doing here

varun dont fit in these frame

Is this Varun Dhawan, what is he doing here?
Why the hell is Varun Dhawan invited to the Actors Roundtable if he isn&#39;t gonna speak. Plus, what&#39;s so special about Judwaa 2, it&#39;s another stupid remake, and watching it makes you wanna wash your eyes with bleach. Seriously, what the hell.

Each time Irfan Sir opens his mouth, you get to learn so many things. It&#39;s noticeable that others on the table are changing their views after listening to Irfan Sir❤️

varun dhawan why did you kill me here?
Why barun dhawan is sitting there?

What the fuck is varun Dhawan doing there dude they are all actors

Why Varun Dhawan is here... That too with such actors🙄... But this is also true in the film like JUDWA 2... This is a bad thing..
What is Varun doing here. .... in between such great actors??🙄

What's wrong with me 😏
What is this man?...
Varun talks a lot!😶

Aayushman khuranaš expressions when varun talks 😂😂😂

Irfan sir new the future that after 3 years these films people will watch on Netflix and that Is what happening.

Why Varun?

Mubarak ho apke ghar stress aya hai Akshay Sir 🔥❤️
Akki the  best

Varun interrupting in between conversations is the most irritating part about the interview 🙄

The fact is varun dhawan can act. He has shown it in Badlapur and October, but I think he rather wants to do commercial movies where he just read the script and overact at comic scenes and so far that has been working for him

Some stars are leaving...but they are leaving their own dreams...Irfan sir, you are an inspiration.
varun has a down toward the earth nature he always be the same

Miss you irfan khan .😥you were a legend 😍

es motu ne susant ke bare me blind article likha tha

Varun ko sharma nahi aati. How could he even sit there amongst talented people such as rajkumar, ayushman and need I say more about Irfan Khan (may rest in peace). How could he even face them after having no talents and bringing back the same shit or should i say ruining childhood memories. He is a criminal. Thats the power of nepotism, behsaram hai sab ke sab, rannu is an exception

What&#39;s Varun Dhawan doing here? Ohh yes bollywood and favorism 👍

<a href="">0:31</a> bablu bhaiya kya hai🤔🤔
In that table instead of varun Nawazuddin would have been a perfect table of talented actors.

Irfan sir say right people more see in future  Netflix😯😯😯
No one even once interrupted Irfan except for Varun... What was he thinking he don&#39;t even deserves to be on the same table as any of them.

Why Akshay and Varun? Although Akshay&#39;s movies are good, his acting is not even close to the other three. I&#39;m not even going to talk about Varun Dhawan 😌

Rajkumar oml he&#39;s so interested in craft n all. His attitude is so good. I love him. ❤️

Really its over all great meeting

I liked how the video started by saying few exceptions and showing golmaal 4 and tubelight clips..😂😂😂

Miss u legend Irrfan ❤️😐😐
Rajeev masad ghatiya

Rajkumar wanted to learn from irrfan 💔

loved this

Irfan Khan&#39;s pauses❤️
I just wonder if Irfan&#39;s son comes to the industry will the people still abuse him the way they abuse others... Or will they let him pass coz they have a soft corner for Irfan

Unlike everyone I enjoyed varun&#39;s presence also.

RIP legend Irrfan
Varun is talking of cracking the record of bahubali 😆😆😆😆😆. What a shit person he is!

Irfaan sir is legend
Irfan khan&#39;s fingers do better acting than varun dhawan

I loved when they ask about the process for big scenes n rajkumar rao asks akshay n irfan sir as if he is taking notes 😅😅

<a href="">54:00</a>

Taj Mahal ke pass KabristanI think you guys understand Varun Dhawan😂

Varun is the most irritating and noisy person in this talk show

Irfan Khan the legend &amp; Rajkumar Rao, the best ones

Miss you Irfan sir❤️
Varun is talking about script and still selects Kalank type movie.
Everything is fine but how can you call Varun for Judwaa 2?
Today 2021 we miss Irrfan Khan so much

Sitting legend Akshay Kumar with new actors that&#39;s suprises me

Rajkumar is so calm and during act he is just awsome Akshay always rocks whatever he does and Irfan is legend in every way i really miss him seeing on screen and Ayushman has a bright future he has talent and Varun is sweet

What a prophetic line by Irfan sir &quot;Netflix and OTT gonna outshades the bollywood&quot;..

wow!!!!

agar galtise galat jage pe beth gaye ho tu chup chap bethe rehna chahiye

Akshay and Irrfan 🙌🙌

Love you Rajkumar ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Varun : Starts talking Me : skips
varun had to choose mediocre films as examples because he has not done any good film yet

Varun talking about director&#39;s hunger 😂😂😂

Everyone is trying to have intelligent conversation and Akshay is just waiting to make a joke.
Not a lot of viewers wanted Varun to be there, but still the comments section is mostly filled with Varun like really?? 😹 Irfan sir had to be here today, he&#39;s missed so badly 😟

The man the legend the actor.... Irrfan Khan.

Why Varun? Seriously why!.!?

ha varun please stop interrupting eat your pista

2018  ok2021  purely just  not ok

<a href="">14:45</a> Man is Varun referring Hera PHERI as a small movie🤔

<a href="">1:00:00</a> omg ...after 3 yr here we r ... rejecting coolie no. 1🙌🙌🙌
<a href="">35:45</a> coz u guys are copycat industry

At last Varun realised...&quot;I have given you time to speak&quot;
I m not Khan......I m just Irrfan.....

What is varun dhawan even doing there its for the best not the best of the worst

Varun Dhawan cannot be part of this round table.....he just don&#39;t deserve it

Love the chat❤️

Everything is fine.. What is Varun Dhawan doing in the list of actors?
Arrey bhai sub log north jaate ye Varun to hamesha ulta south bhag ra 😂😂

Rajeev masand gadaha hai kutta kamina hatyra mauga hai

Hollywood is best

Legendary actor 10 times academy award winner 5 times golden globe award winner varun dicaprio should not sit their with these people he deserves better shame on u bollywood and Rajeev masand

Only akshay sir king of bolywood and best actor ever in bolywood

Varun is so irritating he proves that empty vessel make more noise look at the most talented people they are so down to earth and saying what they are being asked unlike Varun speaking on every question duhhh shut up

Why did you call Varun Dhawan.....Spoil it.....
I think Varun was forgetting whom wass he talking to

Leave Dhawan out and it becomes legendary

: Tell us also : Part bc
IRFAN sir iz ❤️❤️❤️❤️ RIP sir😞😞
Rajkumar &amp; Sir Irfaan was quite genuine on their opinion &amp; Varun was clear in his answers , on the other hand Akshay was &quot;amiable&quot; in his answers &amp; Ayushmaan 👌🏻

Why not call SRK!?

Man, it&#39;s so humbling to see everyone asking Irrfan questions about different aspects of acting. Rest in peace, sir.

<a href="">40:36</a> Akshay be like: Tuhadi family familySaddi family joke
&quot;Daal mein kuch kala hai&quot; proverb got real, you can see Varun wearing black outfit
Irrfan ❤️😔
Films Which Are Working Today, I Am Telling You Will Not Work After 3 Years.. People Will Watch Films On Netflix : Irfan 🔥<a href="">1:00:28</a>

Why Varun Dawan Odd one out

Varun Dhawan is like a horse in the race, he is also leading the team.
Exactly what Irfan said ...OTT platforms will rule 3 years down the line

Miss Irrfan Khan so much after seeing this again n again. He was such a gem in the industry

Ayushmann &amp; varun were talking almost same . Akshay kumar s thinking style is really good &amp; also Irfan khan

Boy has guts to speak about badrinath ki dulhania in a panel full of great, versatile actors. 🤦‍♂️🤭
For the first time  i watched a 1 hr conversation without fast forwarding 😝

I am only here for Irrfan sir.

Did varun dhawan just say that his father&#39;s name is taken as the top directors of our country? seriously?.

Most LOVABLE Khan...IRFAN KHAN🖤
i love the energy on this table! It comes from a place of humility, respect, and genuine fondness for each others work👏🏽

Questions in english and answers in hindi. I still connot understand why these people prefer english.

I still didn&#39;t get why varun is there??

Akshay must have scolded Varun very bad for the interview, asked what would you like, Rajkumar and Ayushman are a thousand talented people, they are trying to teach him silently because they are playing the knowledge as you have known, interrupting Irfan. he is very angry.
<a href="">22:54</a> Varun Dhawan talking about taking pauses between dialogues. 😂😂😂😂Ayushmann controlling his laugh be like “Chup kar bhadwe!”  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Varun Dhaawan destroyed this roundtable. by talking so much

Varun should be replaced by Pankaj Tripathi

To all the people hating on Varun Dhawan, just go hear what Paresh Rawal has to say about him. I&#39;ll say this one thing, Varun Dhawan has great potential, but he makes the mistake of choosing the wrong films which don&#39;t fully explore and present his craft, but he has potential and I know it!

But the actor missing in the discussion, the great SSR

Irfan Khan😍😍
Why Rajeev Masand talk like somebody has put something in his Ass.

Varun ???omg !!!!

Varun Dhawan ☹️☹️☹️..we are missing it somewhere..
Irrfan is adorable❤️

Akshay is funniest man on bollywood now

Me - Arey dost inn mahan actors ke beech yeh kaun pagal hai. My friend - Arey yeh toh Varun Dhawan hai.Me - Yeh toh Tatti hai 😂😂

<a href="">28:07</a>

Varun don&#39;t deserve here.
I want confidence like Varun Dhawan, Aata kuch nahi &amp; The world lived in the wise beach. Whole episode I was wondering bhai where did he apply this and how much knowledge he is keeping🤣
Hey, this guy on the bench has spoken so much. What has happened to everyone?
Legacy, Irfan khan said correctly no one today talks about Dilip Kumar.

I love all of them! So talented each and every one of them Even Varun tbh I really enjoyed his acting in badlapur, soty, and sui dhaaga. I recommend everyone watches them. They’re all pretty good movies of his. :)

Others (Double Tap) : N/AWhen Varun Speaks : Let&#39;s Do it to the Maximum.....

How many guys have touched Varun's ass?
Who so ever did know that irfan sir is no more ..2020 fuck u

Came here for audi add :)

Apart from varun everyone here won national award

Varun irritated with his judwa 2 Man look at them they have done better acting than your judwa 2 in advertisement

At <a href="">56:00</a> irrfan sir made me feel sad People forgot him as he was telling that people forgot dilip sir

Everyone is saying bad things to Varun, he is wrong friend, he also has bad future, he also has life, meaning, who will do this if he keeps himself behind and brings others forward?
They Spoke Truth About Future with Netflix

Rajkumar rao is kohinur Diamond of  bollywood .

Akshay sir  and irfan sir was like hum log aapas m baat krte h 🤣  <a href="">29:15</a>. <a href="">27:55</a>
