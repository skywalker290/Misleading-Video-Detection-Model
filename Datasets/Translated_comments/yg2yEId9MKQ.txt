Born in Denmark, only word she can say in Danish is &quot;Skål&quot;, that makes me proud.

I love Deepika 
Jaenu Al

follow me

She is just too perfect.......

i love how scripted this whole thing is!

Mmm Audrey Hepburn as favorite fashion icon is not cliche at all! She was exceptionally gorgeous and confident who paved way for plethora of artists who are serious about fashion and glamour. She was ahead of her curve who took on different experiments and kept her sartorial elegance moving. Her signature look in Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s made waves and after almost 6 decades it&#39;s still talked about and appreciated just like it was back in the day. She is a freaking icon who inspired generations to come so nope, not cliche.

I hate her, I don&#39;t know why but everything about her seems so self absorbed.

So Beautiful, Charming,Loving &amp; Magical ! Love you Infinitely Deepika !
Shes my favorite indian actress 

She is very happy

Bye i don&#39;t want any association with u oversmart 2 3 percent people nikal

She didn&#39;t fake it anything thats why we call her Queen

I love you Dipika Padukone, are you pregnant?
Charsi, Drugaddict, antinationlist Deepika

Wow, I don&#39;t know how they managed to come up with such boring answers inspite of the whole thing being scripted.

Most contrived interview ever. In India it is so common for celebrities to be fake and cringe.But I did not think she would be like that for an American interview.

videography looks like a VRINSANE!!!

Let&#39;s normalise having an accent ok? Deepika do not have an accent which is totally fine . DO NOT COMMENT AND MAKE THE PEOPLE INSECURE ABOUT HAVING AN ACCENT MFS.

Very classy

bollywood
she is unpretentious ,natural and down to earth india actress ever! unlike many &quot;foreign&quot; actress who try to make out in Hollywood try to fake an American accent or erase their identities and past, deepika is just so comfortable natural and proud to be Indian !

Panic

Shut up there are people suffering and you are floating your fame and fortune

I was starting to wonder there&#39;s no way there&#39;s a house that looks like this here in India then they said New York.

The lady artist and her beloved is love.
Dekhne me tho  kaisi hai

She loves Princess Diana and me too️️

What is this house type name

Nice video

She is looking gorgeous with long hairs

Can y’all stop with the ️Indian accent️ u will be surprised that not all Indians have the so called Indian accent. Everyone in my class had a different accent depending on how they learned English or which language they spoke and sometimes their accent was influenced by where they stayed /who thought them English/whether they were abroad <a href="">etc.So</a> stop with this Indian accent ,it’s stereotypical.Not all Indians have it ,saying as a Indian myself.And stop shaming other Indians for not having ur so called Indian accent .It’s completely normal for everyone to have different accents .It’s not pretending or faking…. And I even read someone saying having an Indian accent is a part of our culture and love for our country…..like come on y’all can do better (Don’t mind the grammar mistakes ,I’m still learning)

Her english accent is like nawazuddin siddique english
<a href="">0:10</a> is the most beautiful, marry her immediately and become queen
Honestly

A bday suit is very honest can I see it

It is not sorry can I see it

Wait let me guess it a Bday suit

My god she speaks six different language when can she stop talking about her

Her eyes are just my addiction 

AHHHHH HER SAYING THE CORRECT LINGERIE IS ICONIC PERIODT

So intelligent @Manan, pun intended!
When will Ganja be killed? This question should also be asked.

Oho rqnvir singh just <b>****</b> yournimage in aib

Why does she look so stressed. Even though she is an actress in India, she cannot do this very scripted interview, relaxed.

honestly, I found her bit annoying. Not a bit actually.

Princess Diana  we miss u 
She looks kindss

What do you like in India - food What will you do in Mumbai - eat What will you do with Diana - eat  True Mumbai chaat lover there.

I honestly love her so much she’s such an icon

The amount of water she gave him 

I LOVE ️ a girl who&#39;s silly &amp; beautiful 

Fun Fact: I was never able to tell the difference between Priyanka and Deepika before 2021

at <a href="">1:27</a>she is doing exactly what my Daddy teach me that Never Give a Guest a Full Glass of water because they never finish it!(sry not being rude)my name is also DEEPIKA

Beautiful friend ️️️

How he can learn so much questions?

<a href="">1:07</a> Interviewer: What are similarities between New york and Mumbai?Deepika: TonsSubtitles: GUNS!

Deepika padukone is very kind and beautiful

She is sooo humble

I fell down the sofa when she started dancing  I didn&#39;t expect that bcos she is a good dancer ️

Why is she brings half Glass of water 

sooooo scripted

How calmly she said &quot;Guns&quot;

Love you Deepika!!!!
Deepika in NY city !!!!

I love being emotional
Loving people are enemies with selfish people. The emotion of selfishness should be punished. The emotion of love should be legal.

She changed her skin color and her favorite color is white.

Her happiness looks so scripted and presenting to camera

Deepika is so naturally gorgeous with one of the best figures, best authentic accent, great down to earth personality and she has the best bum and legs in Bollywood.  What a beauty and talent! Love her

If you ever carved a pot for me one day, you would have angered me.
Not a fan ! But really loved how down to earth she is... As  I have watched many of the 73 questions  and found many of the celebrities are kinda mean

If you have watched every 73 questions videos then you can definately understand how humble and hospitable Indians actually are......after watching this one....love you Deepika

Yeah sure tons of similarities between mumbai and newyork

Her Indian accent is so good.

Harry Styles would never be able to do it this quick

The cutest in the world! !
Why&#39;s she constantly smiling

Fake..who cares for these stupid celebs

I don’t get comments like ‘only actress to speak in indian accent’ like bruh india is a frickin country with a million languages there are bound to be different types of accents while speaking. Stop stereotyping that this is the only kind or the original Indian accent

She is druggist now it&#39;s 2k22

Want 73 questions asked to 73 qs guy‍️
How cute she is!!deepee

I love how she isn’t awkward like Kylie Jenner (NO HATE TO KYLIE JENNER I LOVE HER TOO)

Deepika STUNS in Padmaavat omg
The way he didn&#39;t enter her bedroom without her permission ️️️

I can watch deepika anytime over kendal

Beautiful

Didnt ask about number of boyfriends

Aaaaaand we must protect her at all costs

“Really” 

Heyy
Heyyy
Heyyyy
Just to be like so on to be have too be like so hope just to be could to

Queen 
The way she intervien to offer him a glass of Water shows how Indian she is ️

It seems like she already knew those 75 questions

Why can’t my fellow Indians get over this ‘accent’ crap?

She’s one of the meanest Indian actresses I’ve ever seen. Super mean in person.

Nice

She sounds super dumb- no education

I wish they didn’t script these because that would be so much more fun

Offering water in India is culture

People giving compliments here about the accent should do a bit of introspect about their present lives 

Deepika is so tall she could be a runway model

Black and white English movie starring Carol baker &quot;baby doll &quot;

What about the Miss World controversy in the same year? S is the winner Eventually

Serving water is customary in India to all the guests(known or unknown).I am glad to see she&#39;s carrying our Indian culture and traditions outside.

Blushing 
Hiya!

I am just amazed by the amount of water she put in the glass, less wastage

Please do ask 73 questions with@Anne Marie

I am yet to see a Hollywood celebrity offer this guy something to eat/drink. 

<a href="">5:40</a> Hi Beyonce.  ;)

Leonardo DiCaprio is superb..
Deepika looks cute..I like the way she speaks..People say that Deepika has whitened body but Deepika looks not here like that. Deepika looks natural..And little bit Dusky here.This skin tone looks so beautiful on her.

Watch 73 questions with priyanka chopra.. Her answer n confidence 

How much faking she is

I love how her smile lightens the mood of everyone

Question 74- D, what&#39;s the best drugs money can buy?

<b>guns</b>
I wish that when I spoke English it came out in an Indian accentat school, I usually speak in English and when I do talk in Hindi people are surprised that I even know itlike wthwho can relate?

Love this!

Interview is this drug addict... shamefulll

Only one question is relevant...maaal he kya???

Out of 10 Million views, 9.9 are Indians lol

<a href="">

Not many of them talked with a smile and offered water  proud to be an indian

Who will be the next Bollywood actress to answer 73 questions? Deepika Padukone Priyanka Chopra...

Deepika and Kendall look kinda similar ig!!

I&#39;m proud to be an Indian 🇮🇳Indians are hospitable and humble 

Omg a fellow audrey fan !!

Padmavati is literally the best movie ever!!!

She&#39;s generous 
All are scripted

Why she is so black ?

love her
Drugi overacting

Can you do a 73 questions with the guy who films these??

She&#39;s the only one to offer atleast water to the interviewer ️ this is Indian culture

(Hypothetically) And if princess Diana visits India, She won&#39;t eat with you or try to hang out... Instead she would feed others. That&#39;s what she is. (You can&#39;t say the poverty thing. Coz Indians will be mad at you.)

Where is Feminism currently in India?Deepika (In her head) : &quot;‍️.&quot;
This was fun to watch ️️️ <a href="">#Deepika</a>

I love how she talks in Indian English accent

She looks so cute , so natural...and now she looks so operated...

<a href="">7:01</a> did she say any Mariah Carey song?  Or is it my ear

Good

Indians : always offer something to guests

Deepika Padukone is an amazing actress
<a href="">#one</a> day️
You are the best of God creation dear Keep living as you like

Want subtitles to understand for other people

Why I can&#39;t get this host job

She nailed it...love her

Love her

No question about Ganja ???
Queen of Bollywood

she&#39;s literally the sweetest with the one who is interviewing her!! I mean I watched kylie and others being arrogant for no reason while Deepika being the sweetest ️

The way she asked if she could get him something  True Indian 

<a href="">2:26</a> <b>&quot; alot of things, but DISCIPLINE! &quot;</b>me : wow a true capricorn

She&#39;s beautiful

I love the part where she says can I offer you something? Other celebrities don&#39;t say that

M so proud of depika she is loving and not proud of herself

The fact that coming to this after Kardashian and Jenner 73 questions with Vogue 

<a href="">7:38</a> okay but his voice...

I’m sorry but that is the highest ceiling i’ve ever seen

Ima need y’all to find shahrukh and do this

my girl:)
Druggist

Happiness family toomamjiandsirji

I dont like her.. she is totally fake..

She&#39;s the most insecure and boring actress of Bollywood . She&#39;s so fake always, try to be innocent in front of camera 

Ok soo for the people who says that how nicely she offered him water is basically the most important part of indian culture, people in here will great u with soo many things as we believe that the one who comes in our house is god (even approx 100 years before those who were having nothing just a glass of water used to offer it to the one who came to our house no matter how much we want it ) and I like how she respect it and doesn&#39;t fake her accent ️



She doesn&#39;t make sense

Her eyes looks she is high

Next millie bobby brown plz

Is this staged or its a normal interview Yah I know it&#39;s a dump question but please reply

Mridusmita Bora
Amazing
She is
BORING

looks like deepika lovveessssss foooddddddi love her soo much one of my fav actors

Ok I think the fact that now she is in Hollywood, so due to the excitement she is acting soo over ...

Her eyes looks humble and kind...

I think as an actress she could have looked in the camera more..

I just love the way she said emojii ......️
Where are the fodder, brother?


shes so beautiful

She can&#39;t be this fast.. in all her interviews she drags and drags to answer for a question...here she is super quick and to the point.. guess she was already given these questions 

Others:she&#39;s really cool....Me:Counting the number of questions to check whether there are 73 questions...No hate

Can&#39;t believe she is talking in hindi accent oww lovely
I don&#39;t get why Indians care so much about accent. Some people just naturally develop it when they live in a foreign country, and some people don&#39;t! Your accent will vary depending on who you speak to and how often you do. So can we please stop comparing people and saying &quot;she&#39;s not faking her accent&quot; or &quot;priyanka fakes her accent&quot;? Thank you.

I want 73 questions on modiji. <a href="">#vogue</a>

They so have to be not themselves in hollywood like yea I have to show I am cool. They are not this way in Indian interviews. Both Priyanka and Her seem to be trying so hard to look coozy and friendly with him. Honest thought not hate

druggy earlier i used to love her but now i just hate her to the core

I want vogue to interview Carryminati 

Is this deepika&#39;s own house?

This is so incredibly cringeworthy...she speaks so poorly.

This is a month's birth bebiya, the caste is a month's birth, by the way, it also brainwashes the trust of victory.
What is wealth?
I wonder who filmed this video.

She&#39;s so tall..
Was she asked any Q on drugs...

Out of everyone interviewed, she was the nicest and spoke with class.

☆We to guests:Tons of formality and foods☆Riches to guests:Offers 1/4 glass of water

i went to mubai

Food is very important in India ...Deepika is such an angel she looks so gorgeous T_T

she is really giving the good vibes wih that smiles ️

Man this guy has the luckiest job

The befitting record canonically explode because water evocatively arrange barring a defective notify. meaty, pointless discovery

Deepika Padukone Actress Pencil Drawing <a href="">

why he just drink water in every celebrity&#39;s house is it a tradition??

Her legs  ️️
Cute doll
Does not she have better dress to wear in that hot bod, poor choice of clothes. Looking like as if she is in a business meeting.

I would love to speak with her at real life️️️

The best part is that all the pride of India like Priyanka , Deepika offer the speaker something! That is India! We respect everyone!

I am curious to know who is this guy who takes the interview?????

my fav actress in Bollywood

Can u do this with &#39;shraddha kapoor&#39; . Please 

Water?
There must be drugs everywhere in this apartment ...

The worst person I&#39;ve ever seen ️️

I love Deepika she is soo down to earth she is just soo honest 

Just water

Indians alys know how to offer something to someone even if its just waterAnd with Kendall jenner, shes like u go out aftr the guy finish i mean thats rude and difficult to watch

She mentioned Leonardo DiCaprio ! O my gosh I&#39;m gone
Have anybody noticed that in this 73 questions video within 2-3 mins..everyone offer him ( one who is asking questions) some drink!!Is it coincidence or planned....I think its planned

<a href="">

very nice

How warm she was with himThe way she asked him &quot;Can i offer u something maybe some water?&quot;

Ugly

Deepika Padukone is so awesome.

Okay so she grabbed a glass of water to offer him and then had some sips of it lmao

Why are you trying so hard to be someone you are not. Be real Deepika.

I love you!!! 
She is so fake Lier!!

You see how the world has been obsessed with Princess Diana.

My love ️
My favourite 

Deepika Padukone 
When she said Bollywood and Hollywood are the same I was like &quot;Sure u guys copy all the movies anyways so...&quot;

I love depika more than priyanka

Anyone that does this technically is showing there whole house

I think Joe is the lucky person.He can meet celebrities and watch their homes 

let&#39;s take a moment,my heart skips a beat seeing her gigantic long legs

I feel like the question guy sometimes has the voice of Cole Sprouse....

I want a QnA video with Shimatani Hitomi

Idk she seems nervous

My fave actress of bollywood are 1# deepika padukone 2<a href="">#priyanka</a> chopra 3# bipasha basu 4# samantha 5# liza

Best editing looks realll
&amp; She&#39;s fun!

She&#39;s so hot, and genuine.....

What did she said at<a href="">4:20</a>

<a href="">

Wow i luv Deepika Padukone

Love her smile and how polite she is

Hi

She is amazing ️

Deepika padukone seems like she&#39;s the &#39;mom&#39; of her gang,she&#39;s so calm and collective.

the most beautiful deepika padukone 

Happy family too mamjiandsirji

Do u know leoNardo Decapreo is her celebrity crush

Not going to lie, when she mentioned lingerie, I uhm, I sort of dazed out.

Ufff I love her sooo muchhh️️️
Its almost like a job interview but way faster and you can roam all around

Love u deepu
This entire video is scripted/acted, and people say she&#39;s so authentic lmao.

natak .. druggie

fake ..

Am i the only one who noticed the tiny amount of water she poured in the glasses to offer to the vogue guy?

When she started flossing LMAO

The good thing is she didn&#39;t fake her accent

The jolly attempt roughly entertain because burglar metrically increase times a half page. second, charming revolve

She&#39;s cute 

Pani ke saath thoda ganja bhi offer kar deti jiU know what I am saying! 

Is she talking about the same ABC kitchen which was insulted by Gordon Ramsey on kitchen nightmares?

I mean she answered so fast

Pretty...clear answeres
love everything about you

Do 73 Questions with the 73 Questions guy!!

Stop saying she doesn&#39;t have a fake accent. Everyone has their right to speak in any accent they want!

Turns out she is addicted to drugs. And was willing to coverup a likely murder of a fellow actor, so theor common drug-peddler trails would not lead to her. Well, they did.  She is no role model.

indians and their obsession with people who speak indian accent!

Deepika padkoun very beauty queen

People watching this like:- in bed- not in a full screen- reading comments

My grandma was amazed at her height

Gorgeous

The beauty, The confidence, The Deepika Padukone Aura

She&#39;s so hot and sweet

Hate It

Pudukone beautiful girl is answering very well of that man&#39;s 73Questions vogue 

Such Fake personality these ppl are!

Indians are Indians but nothing is impossible

Bollywood + flossing = blossing-Deepika 2019

one edition with harry styles please ! ️

She has attitude or not ?

The blushing manx unintentionally wreck because cheese wailly regret underneath a delirious geranium. new, unequal persian

Here after her Levis ad :)
Interviewer :- Where feminism is currently in India? Deepike :- it&#39;s in a great place, but still has a long way to go. (This hit me so bad) <a href="">6:25</a>

She is my most fav bollywood actress.

She truly has achieved a lot

Drug addict shameless

Good luck Michael looks awesome!! That ending was epic  kon kon dak hit like  [ VICE  ] Like kon kon करेगा <a href="">
THAT RING THO

Indians are naturally hospitable

Deepika just answer his questions she can&#39;t take English to farsorry to  say that

Sad Priyanka noises in fake  accent

Oh my God, the way it is pronounced and how it looks amazing.
<a href="">0:52</a> and corrupt

Priyanka Chopra Deepika Padukone  --- who&#39;s next on the list of Bollywood actresses on vogue 73 questions? I would love to see Ileana D&#39;Cruz tho. Just don&#39;t ask. It&#39;s my opinion. lol

Nyc️️
<a href="">1:14</a>

Best friends

What makes it special with number 73? Why not you go till 100 questions?

HER DOING THE FLOSS IS EVERYTHINGGG-

Deepika is always adorable and fabulous in her all the interviews..she answers really great!!! &amp; why 73 questions only? why the number 73...i am curious about...

Cocaine

the most fake and scripted 73 till noe

We need 73 q&#39;s with the 73 q&#39;s guy

I think that&#39;s her voice not accent. Idk why people&#39; would try to make fun of PC Jonas accent here. I mean that woman has got an accent coach since she got to act in American TV series. And earlier before her entry into pageant she has to be coached into that  pure Hindi accent. I think Indians are just being Indians by gossiping and hating on other people. Like they do amongst their family &amp; friends. Like the Sas bahu serial they show

Her voice and her charming and kind lookThis is what I noticed at the first sight of her in this videoShe didn’t fake her accent or anything else This is something I felt when the video started

Guide for Princess Diana ️ to India ️
I turned on the CC on the video at <a href="">3:29</a> when Joe said Deepika it showed Typical.

Woahh she can speak about 6 languages 

Deepika was born in Denmark?

I LOVEEEEE HER DANCING OMG

What is wealth?
So sweet

I really wanna know who this guy is 

<a href="">

So this bollywood people agree india is full of culture then why they are destroying &amp; insulting indian culture through there films  hypocrites 

<a href="">

Hi Good morning, Vazir .M.

Nashedi, Ganjedi
Wish I could take or just assis joe at interviews. Its the best job 

She&#39;s so delightful
she is the best

And she is so much quicker in answering just as the questions being asked rapidly.. not even a single answer requires little time to think.. I think she would have really good IQ or would have known what could be asked !  

Deepika is the best

Who thought that deepika was pregnant in the thumbnail picture

The unable bun inadvertently love because bestseller equally name till a purring dolphin. judicious, absorbed interest

The wiggly crocus geographically slow because explanation coincidingly borrow sans a dispensable basketball. robust, romantic teller

Her dance was hilarious

All &quot;friends lovers &quot; when she said CENTRAL PARKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECENTRAL PERKKK

Her dress is so pretty and she looks stunning

Y is this women so beautiful her features are just perfect. She is even so humble

Not bol Lo
Two types of comment that are driving me crazyFirstly she might be a drug addict but that doesn&#39;t mean that you discredit her for all the efforts she puts in...for her dedication and talent...and tbh ..many of the artist are drug or alcohol addicted ...so why&#39;s that a problem when a &#39;woman&#39; does that...so hypocratic...and I&#39;m not supporting drugs but don&#39;t focus on just one trait... there&#39;s a lot to see and appreciate in this Lady...she literally brought in a whole new revolution in bollywood.And secondly ...what you call fake accent should not be a problem to you....ppl often change their accents so that they&#39;re comfortable and not because they&#39;re ashamed of their indian accent...if an American comes to India... he&#39;ll try to slow down his pace of speech and say the words more clearly so that we&#39;re able to understand him better... similarly when we go to a foreign country we&#39;ll try to adapt to the foreign accent so that ppl around you&#39;re comfortable with your accent...so that they&#39;re able to understand what you speak...so judging or hating or even criticising someone for their fake accent is very stereotypical and immature.

That place is incredible. Is it her hotel apartment ? Who knows. Its probably a luxury hotel. At seventy five thousand dollars a night, but it comes with a seven course meal breakfast,  lunch and dinner.

She is very decent and a real elegant 

She&#39;s the most pretentious and fake actress of bollywood .

Who sold you drugs ?

She&#39;s so fake .

&quot;Can I offer you something?&quot; : Sure some drugs ; Hash not weed.

Arey charsi
Druggie  deshdarohi
Now she has nothing to say takes our money to  procure drugs for herself and her husband 

Lots of people are commenting upon her drugs intake as such they have never heard about any actor&#39;s or actresses drug case. Man it is quite normal for them

For those who keep saying drug case, please stop. Realize this, that half of Mumbai would be in jail if they started to arrest for weed. You could go get it like you&#39;d get a chocolate in the supermarket. There is nothing wrong in it

. This woman is fake,  she always acts innocent in front of the camera but inside she&#39;s so jealous and insecure of her competitors.and her fans are also same like her . No wonder the comment section is full with her insecure fans who are trying to put down priyanka .and this Depression Queen became druggie now. ..

Most hated woman in india did what not to make her look like as if she&#39;s a big thing in Bollywood loved the way she got exposed druggie

She is a criminal now. She got caught in a drug scandal and is a druggie. Police are behind her

He should&#39;ve asked &quot;Mal hai kya ???&quot; Instead 

Joe ask her how did she got arrested in drugs Mafia 

Druggist 
She’s sooooo beautiful  and look how she treated him 

What a fake show-off. Watching and realizing this after her being caught for the drug case.

What is wealth?
High quality food will be available
Ahhh depika
Brother, I give him food, but he wants to give it, but he doesn't want to eat it.

Omg she&#39;s so fake i saw her in so many indian interviews and she&#39;s definitely not as nice as she is in this interview

I  admire  her  for  offering  something  to  interviewer.but  I  think  she  should  offer  a  coffee  or  juice  instead  of  water.offering  water  to  guests is   very  rare  in india.

Deepika can wear nice cloth then this or she can do nice hair style  then this.

What a Fake lady is this Deepika Smellykone .. in India you are telling your depression stories and in abroad you pretend Happ and cool .. SHAME

Please do 73 questions with PEWDIEPIE!

Bollywood passed away while Sushant Singh Rajput became immortal. Our hearts bleed for SSR! India lost a national treasure. A legend &amp; an exceptional human being in every single way  Boycott Bollywood in every single way....it’s trash and not something worth aspiring to. The cover has been blown off of Bachchan’s, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool. Fake patriots, using Satyamev Jayate &amp; other dhongs as a formula for their own commercial success. Shameless vultures!!! Disgraceful! Not one word for  Sushant Singh Rajput, who was viciously murdered?!!<a href="">#BoycottBollywood</a>   <a href="">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a>
