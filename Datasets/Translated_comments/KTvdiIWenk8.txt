Who all liked anushka&#39;s old face before her lip job

Anushka, my salute to your family  for serving india in best of ways ::1)Your father is a KARGIL WAR HERO 2)You became india&#39;s YOUNGEST FEMALE PRODUCER at age of 25....And an OUTSIDER in movies 3)Your husband being the CAPTAIN OF INDIAN CRICKET TEAM and BEST BATSMAN IN THE WORLD God bless you &amp; your familyüáÆüá≥<a href="">#RESPECT</a>

I dont think I have any seen any celeb who is as amazing, kind, honest, detached and real in life as is QUEEN ANUSHKA.... To see her evolve as an actor and person since her debut in Rab ne bana di jodi is such a treat in itself... God bless you always ANUSHKA Ô∏è

Wow
