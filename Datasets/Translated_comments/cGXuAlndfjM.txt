Waiting for yuvika chadary

Death to israel how is every1 doing

Beautiful

 lol
Princess
I don&#39;t find her pretty ! But she has amazing glow I wanna know how ?

What’s the point wearing such outfit which gives you a headache and not comfortable at all. These fashion designers suck big time

Just curious, but if she was going to wear this huge dress, it may have been okay to skip high heels, opting for comfortable shoes? The shoes don&#39;t show anyway?

Think about it also darling Deepika
Which wax they are using??

 beautiful
Dipika is soooooo beautiful and a brilliant acter of Indian sinema..

The dress is so preety and she is the preetiest ️

It's like these people are playing with a doll...
She&#39;s so sweet Love you Deepika 
She is looking like a barbie doll

I like her gown

The dress is quite nice... But she&#39;s looking weird. The hairstyle and particularly the makeup is awful and hideous

<a href="">

What gorgeous makeover

Super people! Top 10 amazing actress with amazing fans!<a href="">

she looks like ariana grande

Looking so amazing 
The makeup is so ridiculous, she looked better without makeup

Who is jealous of me! Abb too I am jealous of you!
She looking so beautiful In that outfit 

The bride's sister

She ruined the dress with awful makeup

I wish I could watch the video with Deepika ji.
Mokka fashion video

Wow respect to u .. ur the real world influencer.

Hello Sir, the above video is super, please teach us some ideas so that we can do something.
Get rid of this stupid type
She is lovely

Is it just me or did she look a tad bit similar to barbie in a fashion fairytale? She looks so good in that dress.

Love your look Deepika di
This dress so much beautifull

Great dress on a druggie.

After getting ready, the birds are falling.
Nice make up but she sometimes looks like bhoot copied Dua Lipa look

she shouldve been this year!!!!!

her hairstyle and lipstick color ruined her beauty, didn&#39;t fit her. She looked incredibly beautiful when her total hair was in a bun with the earrings

Indian women are naturally born with the hair, skin, eyes, curves we all want

She is looking really barbie

Just wow....

Beautiful &amp; attracted

top!

Yeah she really looked beautiful and glam without makeup and hair done

The dark lip darkened her too much!! They should have gone with a brighter lip to really brighten up her whole face and some skin toned highlighter!! Her face seemed way to dark after!! Also: HOW DID SHE PEE THAT NIGHT???

Phenomenal

This Outfit is perfect for 2022 Met GalaBut our QUEEN slayed it on that year too

Drop dead gorgeous ️
This look would have been perfect for 2022 met theme Gilded Glamour.

Gosh the dress is holy amazing 

Rose also went

Wow what a dress and make over just admiring the style 

how beautiful my skinny girl
What a dress

The lipstick and eyeshadow is  bit Low like they should make her more sweet but she looked gorgeous

She looked like a Barbie

She look more beautiful in open hair... The stylist could make her more beautiful but-

Am I the only one who got Ariana Grande vibes

She totally look like a &quot;witch&quot;

Who else is waiting to see her 2022 met Gala look

OMG she is stunning

Queen

Ranveer singh should have came, It would have been ICONIC

At this time deepika&#39;s eyebrows were not as lifted as now. Now her eyebrows looks double the time lifted and gorgeous when I saw her interview in THE BOMBAY JOURNEY, mashable India. Her eyebrow professional has done really good job with her eyebrow lifting.

She is full of grace...very grounded but she looks like a hanger..!skeleton bodies are not in these days

She looked amazing!  What a great bubbly personality!

I see u green colour
Omg I love her so much ️‍
She definitely pulled it off with graces

Dress is realy amaizing

Terrible eyeshadow and Lipstick choice. She is prettier than that.

Dress looks good but she is nothing like aishwarya or priyanka

Her personality 
She looks so beautiful 

<a href="">

cartoon

BTS army colour 
She was looking beautiful before make up and hairstyle

Jnu ma maja kari
She is so energetic...

Looking like birsa munda after makeup

note : its meant for cleaning the floor not for covering body...

Glad we have someone amazing representing us Indians 

Who is this gala, brother?
<a href="">

She’s a vision omg

Woww
her lipstick tho

She is beautiful but I don’t like the purple/pink eyeshadow.

I love how she talks about Ranveer and the way Ranveer talks about her!! Made for each other ️

On the Kapil Sharma show, she said that after wearing these long dresses, you have to keep some people with yourself . I thought she was joking, but now it is clear that was true.

Zac is looking so kind so calm he is really such a great artist 

BOLYWOOD AR PAGLI,RUBISH

The year Deepika was a part of Met gala, was the best Met gala for me. No doubt why my Indian friends call her a Queen.

I knew it that only when you put the lipstick the make-up is complete but today I got the demo too. And a love the fact that Cinderella  music when she was  on the carpet

she gives me Ariana grande vibes with the personality, the ponytail, and the poses I GET ARI VIBES YALL

Our Barbie 
Deepika is the best in Bollywood. Humble and classy!

Deepika overdoes everything so people don’t know what to focus on

ITS MUCH BETTER WITH CHOPRA MANY HAVE NOT SEEN IN MET GALA !
Oh my god hindi is so complicated language I can&#39;t understand their single word untile they started to speak in english. At first I was hearing just &quot;kachu machu pichi hae ooodbdbnsajnsb he he he&quot;

I swear whoever made that dress deserves an award!!!

Deepika and ranveer are so cute man. And watching Deepika and Priyanka together is a bliss. Both beautiful Indian ladies .

She is the most beautiful woman in the world ️

Have to show full make up .. can’t show whole tutorial makeup lol.. have to show her true face can’t show her true colour face lmao

Indian beauty 
<a href="">

And here.... 32-5 years.... dating.... ONE and Only!!

She is such a beautiful woman like Barbie  

Bhutani

How can someone hate her she&#39;s the most real and adorable person i have come across 

Her hair looks exquisite! Beautiful dress
At first she wear that dress without makeup looking naturally very beautiful. After that over makeup in her eyes are look like plastic doll eyes.

Dress makeup n hairstyles too bad

Priyu &amp; deeps ️🇮🇳&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Love u 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Itane dressing k bad su su aaya to
Oh! she looked so pretty !

Wow beautiful  
I wish for just once I could do that. The hair and makeup and dress. It’d be the greatest day/night ever.

Bollywood cinema white+white lady boys no black man Indian cinema no equality ?(NB Bollywood cinema no equality ?)

Too much bronzer and wrong lip color

Proud to be INDIAN

Looking so beutifull ️
Raveer should attend met gala... Seriously man

How bad her accent is!

katrina is more beautiful than deepika..

Wow I&#39;m so proud of her

Her hair gives me gigi vibes

Cute vogue with deepu.

Why do I feel like this is priyanka chopra and not deepika padukone

i was here

the dress is incredible

Woww Deepika

Without heels shes already freaking tall with heels shes F-ING tall and I&#39;m jealous of her height

Not bored of watching it repeatedly

Danm he rode her for free for SIX yrs? how embarassing to mention! Doesn’t she even understand what she’s saying.

She looks gorgeous as always!

Wow

Gigi Hadid’s hair inspiration for 2021 met gala is this

<a href="">5:01</a> &quot;One look is Bra and Panty&quot; HAHAHAHA LOL WTF Lady Gaga ke lag gaye! It&#39;s not &quot;Bra and Panty&quot; on the MET GALA, it&#39;s loungerie! &quot;Bra and Panty&quot; is so middle class! LMAO

Queen 
Kapil sharma, ranveer, dulhaniya le gayi,
She looks like a princess

She was looking good but that eye look was not suiting her dress actually

Worst look.ever

The dress is gorgeous, may be she should have gone without that weird makeup, especially hair

What is wealth?
She Doesn&#39;t need any Makeup, So much Beauty

I really like hear india accent 

nice video.  <a href="">#magnifique333</a>
Met don&#39;t want to down their reputation that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t invite these crackheads this year 

21 million views this is power of Indian actress 

Even without making up she is so stunning then!

OMG this dress is so pretty 
<a href="">4:52</a> <a href="">5:00</a>

She looks like a complete Indian princess

Woahh she&#39;s so tall and upon that her heels!!

Whhhhat she went?? That’s crazy cool

<a href="">

SHE IS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN OF THIS PLANET I SWEAR !
Gigi same style

She is such a gorgeous woman!!! Also mad respect for her cuz she had to go through headache medicine and numbing cream.

How does one sit in that dress???

Missed her !!!!!!!!

Amazing amazing queen
Gigi hadid looks
art hai art

This is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool!

Deepika looks stunning but why such a bold lipstick 

This outfit will suit my husband better.
Rubbish Styling…
Waoo wat a fab dress

Now this is called the Met Gala Look!!

This year Gigi Hadid did kinda same look in black n white

She&#39;s looks like kendall jenner 
can people sit in this kind of dresses or they go through the whole event while standing...... just curious

Did she meet Rosé blackpink?? Bc She was also there

Da heck Deepika with Rosè
I think Gigi&#39;s recent Met Gala look is somewhat similar to Dipika&#39;s

Did the Indian accent really need subtitles? Lmao, Vogue making Indians feel as if the English spoken here was unintelligible.

She looks like Ariana grande in this one

She is sooooooo pretty ️️
no Priyanka, no Deepika, no Ranveer for MET 2021....disappointed

I dunno why some  indian feeling so bad if somebody speaks in other accent all countries learn skills tat how to speaks in other accent but if an indian try to speaks in other accent some rookie indians be like awww she&#39;s speaking in aa faaaaake accent but in reality they always says this legendary dialogue man cause they can&#39;t speaks in other accent. well kpop alll artist used to speak in american accent but koreans don&#39;t have any kinda issue man they are not like yuh. indians who r changing their thinking about accent are so cooooool . some Indians who still do fake accent fake accent are <a href="">#WAA</a> ,means worried about accents

She was invited this year too, but couldn&#39;t go because of her so so busy schedule. She&#39;s continuosly shooting for 3 films simultaneously. Super hectic schedule.Missed her!!

<a href="">

Barbie gown was so amazing, but the eyeshadow and lipstick color I don&#39;t like it.

Omggg she is gorgeous

Too much makeup

SHES LOOKING WEIRD

How beautiful the dress is and how bad makeup n hair U do

Ugliest dress

<a href="">

The worst dress of met gala

<a href="">0:40</a> cute reaction 
She was one of the best dressed at this event hands down. Stuck to the theme in an elegant and beautiful manner.

Indian designer should design more fashionable dresses...

So pretty

She doesn&#39;t know what camp is

The biggest thing i don&#39;t like is her  lipstick i feel like if they make like heavy gown and heavy hair then shimmery eye look so they have to put light lip shade for her whole look maybe something like pink red mixture or add lip glosses

Solid solid
What was the theme for this gala?

What a pleasure it would be to dress such a leggy lass. ️

She is looking like as angel

I am a 10 years old girl and I am your big fan .... I want to meet you ... You are so beautifull . I will also try to be an actress .. You also look nice in movies And your dance and meakup is also very nice ... If my dream is possible then I will be very happy ...

Who is doing her makeup

Drugeeeee
She was my Favourite but I hate her only because she chose wrong side only to promote her film. It was not a wise decision.

She looked more beautiful when she tried her dress for the very first time without any makeup and hairstyle!

Hey Barbie Shantipriya
Who else is thinking exactly &quot;why on earth did YouTube recommend me this video?&quot;

Amazing
Weebee phobea is right, why so difference between them both

Hello, how are you?
This tells me how much actresses have to go through to look so gorgeous every single day. The way she said about having to take a headache medicine and applying numbing cream to her feet so that she doesn&#39;t feel pain... is very sad!!

I came here to hear her talk

Red colours

I wish her make up was not this much!She would have look more prettier with less make up!

<a href="">0:53</a> When she said art, my mind is &quot;yeh art hai art&quot; Only Indians 🇮🇳 can understand this! 

Why does her face remind me of Young Madonna at certain times?

At <a href="">5:48</a> that was so cute the way she was walking ️ and sipping some coke

B n D r j h

she  said the word &#39;literallay &#39; many many times.

Deepika is looking too beautiful, Her dress is best

She is beautiful

Accent is subjective. You can model it however you like. It isn’t about ‘abandoning your indian roots’ wtf does that even mean? First off, there is no indian accent. I’ll talk however tf I want. Stop hating on people who don’t have an indian accent. It’s toxic.

Being a celebrity is really so tough️

She is queen deepi

Hmmmmm
girls actually take a lot of time to get dressed........

Wow nice makeup
That bold pink lipstick has ruined everything................

Belkul achi ni lag rhi

With make-up or without make up she&#39;s so beautiful ️

Beautiful dress but no for the hairstyle

Yaaaak she looks yaaaak

Her hair makes her like like a glamorous barbie doll. So pretty

Sorry i don&#39;t like the make up is very scary and the dress is too mush....

Zac Posen ahhhh I esp loved him on project runway

Shes beautiful. I love how sincere and humble. The gown is gorgeous. I love how she said that its not just a dress its art. Fashion sure is art

How can she sit.. Or it&#39;s a standing dress

what i want to know is how do these guys sit?

beauty does not require make-up, dress or any artificial thing we use, its rather a natural thing. Even a little girl of a town who has not even listen about showbiz looks more beautiful than these kind of stunts performed by female actors,  wearing massive dresses and other stuff. These people are rented by cosmetic and fashion companies to business, not for the well being of society

queen i’m ur biggest fan 
Lipstick dark ha
Everything was nice except her hair

beautiful women wid dumb n stupid hair do .....

Beautiful video 
Deepika is the best girl,

That lipstick is horrible

<a href="">0:50</a> yup depika send her famous dialog &quot;art hai art !!!&quot;

Wait. I JUST LOVE THAT MAKEUP. I&#39;m more towards a natural makeup thingy but, her makeup was just sooo. What do I say? Eye catchy 

She&#39;s so beautiful :)

who else think the makeup ruined the beautiful dress?

Her reaction to the dress was so mixed that even Zac Corsen was confused.

The way she speaks about Ranveer is love 

Ewww Makeup was a bit off 

Deepika mam u are looking fab !!

Druggist!!!!! Chal haat
What is the purpose of these kinds of shows? still don&#39;t understand whose wearing these types of clothes on daily basis. .? I

“Some young women confuse their self-worth with their ability to attract the attention of men, and so pour all their energies into makeup, clothing, and jewelry. If only they realized that virtue, honor, and self-respect are the marks of a true beauty.”― Epictetus

Deepika is such an inspiration and she&#39;s way better than priyanka because she&#39;s such a diva

Ranvir Singh is like Bollywood&#39;s Harry Styles!! 

Chudail

this is where i realized male idols are very lucky...they nail it with just a tuxedo...but femal idol&#39;s clothing drag more attention so they have to be very picky

I like she dress style

Nice dress

He can&#39;t stop looking at Deepika

shes literally so beautiful

Is dress ko pehenne k baad toilet lag gaya to Kya karte hai?

Everything is fine. But if you need someone else for holding your dress. How&#39;s that even okay?. I mean you need a person only for holding your dress. That sounds soo dependent!!!..  Though I loved that dress. She looked pretty.!!!

She literally looks like an angle

She is enjoying this Bhosdiwali with her mother Bhosda...!!! We have wasted our time because of this mistake!!!
Dress and her own look itself is better than the make up

That squeaky bye. ( ._.)

I love Deepika ️

WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW she looks so beautiful and decent without makeup 

<a href="">

Shes the most viewed model in vogue

I think deepika padukone is not looking so beautiful

<a href="">

Adorable 
Dress axha Parr make up ganda

Sadhik

Amazing beauty

Why is makeup allowed in modelling?? when calculator is not allowed in exam halls, drugs are not allowed on Cricket/ football field...  !!!!

Cheao look.not elegant

Perhaps Ranveer Singh was not invited to Met Gala cuz they knew he would take all the spotlight of the day (no offence to any celebrity just my opinion)

I remembered that before being an actress she was a supermodel so she’s familiar with all the routine of working with designers

Dream girl️️️️ just like in om shanti om️️
&quot;What is food?&quot;
I think she looks more beautiful without makeup.....wt u guys think 

I like deepika without any make up

She looks good without makeup  and cute with denim dress

Drug didi
If you are reading this I hope you are a future millionaire  

Don&#39;t bash her for her beautiful look and outfit. This is exactly what &quot;camp&quot; is! It&#39;s all over-the-top and exaggerated. Look at her exaggerated eye makeup and hairstyle. The Barbie-like dress is designed in a way to give it a 3-dimensional look.

The dress omg ️
5.53.......
What would there make up cost.....?

It looks so funny whenever she passes a door

She looks like a troll

THE DRESS WAS NOT AT ALL EXPERIMENTAL AND WAS NOT MEANT FOR THAT THEME.SHE PLAYS SAFE AND I DONT LIKE THAT.

We love you khalid 
<a href="">

This was kinda Om shanti om vibes who all agree the whole dress and hairstyle?!!

Deepika looked so gorgeous at Met Gala.

dress amazing but the makeup didn&#39;t suit it!

Don&#39;t trust her she is the most fake person in bollywood and now she admitted that she is a druggist and her hubby too and go and watch what her bag contains she didn&#39;t shows the drugs and bottles of whines

Every girl expect this who are r right

It&#39;s a really off putting colour.. sorry for being negative. I tried liking it.

I love Dipika's voice n smile...
The dress was good but it didn&#39;t go well with the theme... It was out of the theme

Charas Ganja Mereko Pyaara

<a href="">0:41</a>Reaction of the man

Ur hairstyle ruined u totally

That dress was so beautiful on her,its so well made,it flows with her...she looks like a personified lotus.This would have been perfect for almost any other red carpet,but The Met Gala has a theme,and i don&#39;t think the dress did it justice...on the other hand she did look near perfect and the fan in me could not help but squeal with happiness 

She is looking so stunning  and obviously like sleeping beauty (Disney, berbie)....️️
So beautiful  maybe you&#39;re miss univers
chilling with our money..wahh

Ugly af

Movie tamil please

Inlogo is an Actor who is sick hein ce ?
Met gala is known for bizzare dressup..  I know she&#39;s looking beautiful but its a impropriet dress up according to competition.. I don&#39;t think priyanka should be troll for her dressup.. Cause she dressup according to theme..she&#39;s already miss world.. She know what to wear where..

How do they handle these kind of dresses..... I can&#39;t even handle my jeans all the time I use to pull it up by jumping even publicly.... I am comfortable in lower and the shirt.... People around me are always like tumhara kuch ni ho sakta

Nice

<a href="">0:53</a> art hai art kuch yaad aya ???
omg too much overacting....

<a href="">

She really looks like a Barbie ️️

She is literally looking like an angel

Wooooow. Stunning shapes and colour  Perfect to enhance her beauty

ok I wish someday i will be a celebrity

Is that the designer beside Deepika, he is just 

My hairs will fall so badly if i do anything like this to them

Deepika looks like barbie doll.. You are my favorite 
Why does she always wear full face even in the start when she saw her dress

Deepika has a natural beauty  please don&#39;t ruin her look by adding lots of products bcoz it ruins her original beauty. Anyway she is looking like a BARBIE doll

the way the designer looks at her omg

She can just wear block heels which  are more comfortable and gives desired height instead of those painful high pencil heels and using numbing cream...Anyway those heels aren&#39;t showing in that gown... Makes sense haina?

I just love her dimple .......

Cool

<a href="">

Deepika padukone is my favorite 
Her outfit is woooow!But her makeup not reallly good..

Itna makeup ka kya fayda jo sundrta hi khtm kr de... Bina makeup hi thik tha...
