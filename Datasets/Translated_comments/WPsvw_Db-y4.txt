Please is this phone worth buying in 2023

Price??

Utras for the s20

40% of the reason I love watching his phones review is to see his hands. Wow!!!😜

im thinking of buying this phone i at the moment have S9 plus be hones should i buy the S20 Ultra.

2020 released but this is my phone in 2022 :)

See carefully what things in his hands, its oneplus 8pro !! This video publish before its launching, hm

I want this phone but it&#39;s still expensive

im very much loving the s20 plus. its darn near a perfect phone.

Hello, I'm Laci, you're watching tech2 :)
FAILED PHONE

Hello, I have one question about samsung galaxy phone. I was thinking of buying an s20 ultra this year but s21 ultra is coming soon next year. Is it more worthwhile for me to wait for the s21 or is it more worthwhile for me to buy the s20?

This mobile spec is far more better then my laptop

Ultra

Theirs just no need to get it, computers drive forward because people build gaming pc&#39;s, unless you play games on a phone their is just no need to get something with those specs, takes nice pictures, surf web decent speed, good UI, thats all you really need on a phone.

Samsung used to be a market leading phone until they decided to give inferior chipset in European market now even the cheap Chinese phones are better than them.

Out of all the videos I’ve watched, this is definitely one of them

HA HA, funny start !

S20 ultra is a technology made for Indian aunty for snooping around the neighbourhood

He stills calls it mkbhd

Nammude mammokkayude aduthulla phone Alle ith
I really appreciate this guy, he makes things easy to understand for those of us that don&#39;t know a lot about tech lingo, but still makes it clear what the product is and what it can do

Damn, no phone is big in your hands.

Let me guess: he loves it?

PLUS

Budget

MKBHD elaborate please...

Now samsung has no more thing to add to the camera other than microscopeletsss goooo!!!

not too long ago (2015) flagship phone only cost 500-600, and then Apple sell iPhone X for $999, in the future, if Apple sell their phone for $19,999 samsung be like &quot;Our Galaxy S70 Max Ultra Only Cost $24,999&quot;

The s20 comes with the glass protector!

I bought the s20 ultra

Would anyone else like a phone without a slick/smooth back? Like a sticky side so you didn&#39;t feel like it would slip out of your hands!

These are getting more expensive by the year

S20 just does sub 6

Apple will have this tech in 4yrs and rename it some pompous ass libtard fence riding we discovered it 1st name. PS: I am team apple.

Just got my s20 ultra, first samsung phone i use after 6yrs of iPhone. Jumped from iPhone 8 to this one! Cant compare the phones but the s20 ultra is the best phone I ever used! Love it

Imagine this phone the same form factor only smaller with the same camera but with zero bump and the camera is in the center instead of being in the corner, the camera is behind the glass. That would be a piece of art. The only thing that is stopping so many people from buying this phone is the size and the large camera bump on the back, otherwise the phone is excellent

And he still uses an iphone

Who saw Supersaf camera tst S20U vs P40 Pro+ where S20 Ultra had faster focus

yeah so the S10 Series and Note 10 and S20(+) are better, because they have a normal 12 mpx cam, each Pixel is bigger and can Catch more Light: This is why iPhones e.g and Galaxys(before S20U) have such good Video footage! But 48mpx and all above doesn&#39;t make sense, it makes everything even worse!!! So Pixel Binning is a crime!

I&#39;ve got the UK exynos S20 standard but it feels slower than my old S10 except the 120hz when it works and doesn&#39;t slow down. What can I do to make this feel as fast as it should be and stop it slowing down frames automatically? I&#39;ve tried setting it to optimised and high performance mode. I&#39;ve tried disabling animations and 0.5 in dev options. I&#39;ve tried 120hz at 720p and 60hz 720p. I&#39;ve tried medium power saving mode lol. Can anyone help? Thanks!

What a beast of a phone! Makes me re-consider my iPhone..

Bruh the RAM is massive

Can we print true 108mp photos?

This is the best phone I&#39;ve had in years!!!!The only real competitor too me was my old lg stylo 3 wich was trash

With Ultra, I can really get UFO sightings as clear as possible.

s20+ and s20 Ultra are compatible with Mmwave 5G

You have become a &quot;pro&#39; Apple customer, I can see biasness in your reviews, you &#39;re just elongating the analysis of the phones, discussing minor flaws all the way (rather being general in reviewing things, you discuss how and to what extend you don&#39;t like a particular thing (we like to know those imperfections but not a whole video about it). Do justice with every piece of tech and please stop being cocky to every phone out there, make reviews in the perspective of a common user. peace!

Another giveaway bro 😊

I wonder when we are gonna get to the stage where you - as an average person - cannot afford a regular phone anymore because they all need to be super fancy which you basically don&#39;t need.

hey guys .please help me grow my chanel and subscribe.Budowlaniec w Anglii

does any body know how can we screen video from a samsung like screenshot but video...? i used to have this option in my iPhone but dunno how to do it in samsung...

the s20 ultra seemed great on paper but has too many issues. Exynos variants have garbage battery life, and even snapdragon version still lag behind the 11 pro max. The 8k recording is practically useless, and the video recording is once again behind apple in terms of quality. The 100x zoom is terrible at high powers and the fingerprint unlock is again slower than apples. As with samsung, only decent thing was the screen

Need your advice should I buy galaxy Note 10 plus  or galaxy s20 ultra.

<a href="">1:29</a> it’s kinda ironic that the app he’s looking at is plague inc.

I think the S20 Plus is the better deal, and I don&#39;t think the Ultra brings anything desirable to the table except the 10x zoom. The S20 Ultra camera focus system is Phase Detection AutoFocus,  which is slower and less reliable than the full sensor Dual Pixel AutoFocus on the S20 and S20 Plus, and does not work as well with moving objects.100x zoom is just a novelty due to the useless photo quality, and the S20 moon shots can be beaten by holding a $15 plastic telescope up to a regular phone.

FACT : if you rub the S20 Ultra , four times really hard it expands to the Samsung Wall MicroLED TV a whopping 292 inches !

Does the phone have headphone jack?

P30 pro: u can see the moon. S20 ultra responds: u can see a person on a moon. 10 years later: p140pro : you can see mars. S100 ultra: u can see the volcanos on mars. Iphone 21 pro max ultra s: hold my 2x optical zoom.

Who is watching in S😋20

Deep down you know you don’t really need this phone. Unnecessarily extra on sheet and practically you won’t be using as much spec as it has.

The Best tech Youtuber....

Hey Thanks for your video. I have three queries to you as I gonna buy a new device. Its very important to me....

1. Do you think Ultra&#39;s auto focus  can be fixed by software update? or its hardware issue? if it is hardware then whats the fate of this device?

2. Does s20+ have same issue? 

3. Whats the difference between Note 10 + camera module and s20 Ultra / s20+ camera module? Thanks

Watching  on my Ultra🤑
Tech2

Buying a phone + a portable camera  still less $$$ than an S20 Ultra... Thats sad!

actually, I planned to buy the note 20 ultra when it&#39;ll be released but there are two reasons for me to be scared:A. if the s20 ultra is priced at 1399$ minimum, the note version will be at least 1549$.B. samsung&#39;s 1399$ pricing reminds me of pewdiepie&#39;s 399$

R.I.P.          BROOOOOO!!!!!!!!

120hz only on 1080, why doesn&#39;t he mention that

Samsung is shit

S20 ultra gay
I dont understand why there is need of 12/16 gb ram on a phone ??

quick everyone.. isis is stood next to him whispering coronavirus in the video at <a href="">1:37</a> forcing him film this video, save mkbhd..

🔥🔥🔥  <a href="">1:09</a> 🔥💖💚   👇👇👇💗
12 to 16 gigs of ram Meanwhile my computer is struggling with 4 gigs of ram

I just canceled my s20+ 5G due to stronger frequencies. Any phones that have 5G causes cancer. I&#39;ll stick with 4G for now even though it&#39;s still harmful, but lesser than 5G.

It is absolutely no different then my g4 that I had last week..absolutely no difference..I still get no reception in my areas that I had g4..its all bullshit..I&#39;m no better off from g4..now that I went to g5..its all bullshit

No more smaller sizes? Like S10e?

Sorry to tell you. U are wrong about the 108mp camera makes a big difference. And the price is worth it..

Ok but why do I need to an 8k camera and  16 gigs of ram 🐏 for calling and scrolling through a site??

Someone needs to do a video on a pro mode camera test. I would love to see how far the raw photos can be pushed with a little post work.

You’re holding the phone over a high place. Makes me nervous

That phone is more powerful than my laptop sheesh lol

Samsung: 100X ZoomApple: <b>1000X</b> Zoom
still no review

1400$? I’m fine with the s10 plus!!!

HEY brother do you have a Samsung referral code that you will like to share please .

Ultra

What will happen if we try the 100x Zoom towards the Mighty Sun 🌞🔱 ?

2018: huawei 50 X zoom2020: Samsung 100 X zom.2025.....2030: Samsung : Built in celestial telescope.
When will we have night vision integrated into our phones?

Does the sd version work in europe?

I get the feeling Marques got tired of all the superlative high numbers being quoted, like, this seems a bit overwhelming and like some kind of marketing gimmick but here I am saying what they wanted me to say.

People  photography really did change actually

Man no 1tb internal storage on the Galaxy S20 Ultra damn but hey 512gb works too

Wtf 6.9 inches what the heck Samsung and 240hz woah

Samsung did what Apple did finally and bumped the price so high let&#39;s go

Ahaha S20 Ultra ad on S20 Ultra video 😀
I don&#39;t care if it jerks you off too, I&#39;m not paying $1400 for a smartphone

I might stick with my note 8. Lol first time not feeling that my phone is outdated after more than 2 years

How do you maintain NOT having any ads on your videos?? Please give @GrahamStephan some of those tips 🤦‍♂️

👍 video - which model comes with 16gb ram? ... the 512gb storage model in black only

<a href="">5:33</a> But you do Marques... Deep down you really do know what we&#39;re going to be doing with 100x outside our windows with a periscope lens 👀😂

Samsung is ass and is for poor people

this phone is definitely required to ... show you can afford it.

After ı lost a lot of earbuds and I discover this Bracelet earbuds and newer lost it recommend it to everyone     @t

marques brownlee is gay

It would be great to see a video on Vivo Apex 2020!!

Smh hear how u go in hard on all the specs like this is the only phone...the lg way better

Shit just listening to u talk about this phone and how u try play off all the shit about this phone jus show me u guys most be getting payed from samsung cause i see the cam bump and that shitty zoom and u play it off like its ok but make it was a LG phone and i know u would make it look like its the worse phone ever

I was gonna get the ultra but now I don’t think so.  I just can’t justify dropping that many greenbacks on a device.  I’ll stick with my s10 another year.  The cost just took the fun out of it.

I got a Samsung j3 $50. $1,400 u can buy a beater car 🤔🤔😂😂 4 dat price

Future : You will have many pre installed cameras in tourist places, Just connect to it and take a high resolution picture from your mobile. No more 50-100 megapixel camera&#39;s

$1400... It&#39;s only a matter of the only the rich can afford these phones

12 Gigs of RAM is already a lot. Now they wanna bump it up to 16. 8 gigs is enough for a phone. But it&#39;s fine either way.

Amateur porn is gonna look insane with these cameras.

My mind is into the Ultra, my wallet is into the s8.

Look at stars with the phone it&#39;s the best to show people the true about the stars so yet

I&#39;m not an apple fan but in my opinion iphone is the best phone at the moment and a long time from here on, we have to be realistic samsung has been and will always be under apple can not compare. The best performance the best camera , the best software optimized. The only thing that is currently a &#39;&#39;plus&#39;&#39; for the samsung is the &#39;&#39;zoom camera&#39;&#39; which is a crap, a marketing thing, totally useless. Don&#39;t waste your money on the s20. If you have the money to buy the s20 ultra do not buy it is the biggest mistake. Buy iphone 11 pro or pro max which is even cheaper and much better than s20 ultra. I am not paid by anyone to say this but this is the truth.

Z flip

I sold my winning iphone 11. because if i can get my need in about 200 dollars then why to showoff

On the real, if you work at a certain hardware and lumber store... you can save up to $400 on the S20 Ultra and Galaxy buds+...

How not to like YouTubers in 2020! I still don&#39;t get why so much criticism on Samsung and the whole Android phones? If it was Apple with 108 megapixel zoom, Youtubers will make it like the best thing in the world and say go with Apple.I am really impressed with Samsung this year, the price is high, but they have a reason why is so high. The best thing is that the price of s10 will drop😍👍👍

I saw you try to swipe back like it is on iOS. I’ve had an Android for 2 days and that’s my biggest issue so far

Apple gang round hea cuhh😂😂
Apple:We skipped number nineSamsung:Well we skipped 9 numbersHuawei:Lol we skip 10 numbers every year

It’s time to face the obvious facts, that phones have nothing new to offer anymore except better cameras. My best advice to you is pay off your phone and keep it as long as you can.

While Samsung makes good smartphones, knowing they don&#39;t support my two year old Note 8 (for $1000) by not giving it Android 10, I will not be buying another Samsung device again.Next phone:Pixel 5oriPhone 12 Pro Max Plus Minus Equals

Best smartphone

Korian and Chinies products are just crap and garbige

Samsung: Because We Can
win s20 pro or ultra from Mrwhosetheboss @t

Still the base model iPhone X costs more than this in India

What do you think would be for the Note Series. Maybe just add the S Pen to that phone

all I want from a phone is to make phone calls.🤪

My brain for samsung s20 ultra My heart is also for samsung s20 ultra But my budget is for samsung A10 👎👎👎👎

I&#39;ll wait till price drop

With the design of the camera and the bump, it looks like an iphone design, ugly and samsung looks like going back in time rather than moving on to future. I dont like it.

The way you talk about any other phones or gadget... You seems familiar to so called Apple&#39;Fanboy&#39;. 🤙🏽

I didn’t go watch the S20 video lol

SMH now people are bragging over zooming rights..... zooming...

Are you checking Sony Xperia 1 MKll???

That 16GB is much needed for GoPro 360 processing. My S9 is burning up from the heavy load of processing.

Watching a preview of a phone I will never have, ok I&#39;m done...

This phone price covers alot of my stuff for 6 month

Question do you think the new Note 10 is going to top this phone when it comes out in October

You are the American IKnowreview

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  <a href="">1:08</a> 🔥🔥❣   👇💝
What is the minimum focal length for rear camera? Will the hybrid zoom work well for macro shots?

I will buy this phone 2022 300 $

Waste of time a 120 hz phone review on 30 fps vídeo.

You Can use the 10x zooms to spy on people. Imagine if a paedophile get a hand on this device.

I feel bad for spending so much money on this phone. And I&#39;m upgrading from a galaxy s8

I though the s20+ also had mmWave....

Wow I love cool phones but, me still using my Tecno Y2

2020: felt like my s10 is old2021: felt like my s20 ultra outdatedMe using s8 &#39;)

iPhone is officially dead. Unless they come out with OLED screens, there&#39;s no way Apple can beat Samsung.

For sure the ultra, I can care less about the other two basic models. Go big or go home.

Neither. They fooled us with the note10+ giving us an already outdated speced phone for the price we paid for it. This was a huge insult to us note loyal customers. Thanks but never buy Samsung again.

I wish to have one of your reviewed phones as a gift to my son😥

Why TF do you need 12 or 16 gigs of RAM on a phone?? My gaming laptop runs on 16

I&#39;m so torn between getting this phone or wait for the iphone 12 :( What should I do?!

I think S20+ is practical if you want the best high-end phone. It has the same specs as the Ultra except for the 108mp and battery.

2030 - phone can zoom up to mars, so that you can see what elon musk doin...

Expecting a review of sony Xperia 1 mark2

Still has those home keys, wish they had the swipe up like BB10 or iOS.

watching this on my iphone 8

Please review the Sony Xperia 1 Mark ii...And compared it with other flagships

Oh yes, the useless phone

Ultra

Can you please do a review of the CAT phones?

I think you said the s20+ does not have 5g UWB, which is false. The s20 is the only s20 series phone without 5gUWB

Prefer the Ultra

I will definitely go for the s20+ .... the ultra is just too much and I am a power user so I will run that phone thru hell 😂

Disapoointed you didnt do any side by side pictures.

Just ordered the ultra, and going by camera tests that are now starting to come out, this setup is amazing and the others for now have been left in the dust.

My mom going on a air plane I am grounded playing on my ps4 my mom  takes  out her Samsung 20 ultra a and uses the 100 zoom camera and see me on my play station and then she messages telling  you grounded form longer amount of time when I get back home

Most expensive thing I&#39;ve ever bought... God, what have I done. This is a terribly mistake I&#39;ve made.

🔥🔥  <a href="">1:33</a> 💗   👇👇👇💖
I am at an age now where I wish smartphone manufacturers would make cameras worse again.

Is the &quot;screen protector&quot; the Ultra comes with out of the box, worth keeping on it? Or just replace it right away with something else?

Please do a review on the new Xperia 1 Mark 2

is it possible to zoom in and out with the frontcam ?

What will they do next year? 32GB RAM? It&#39;s insane. I don&#39;t think beyond 4GB or 6GB it makes any difference.

Iphone 11 pro max is better option rather than this tablet sized shit styled camera smartphone.If you can use this s20 utlra with just one hand I will purchase it right away!

Best phone ever ,I need for my job ,plus it will pay for it self I need that quality of pictures for my reports and get paid ,my galaxy 9 does great but the newr the better

So what is everyone  doing for the micro sd card.

1 weak late

for 108mp the difference is disappointing, its only about 10% visibly better

In one year that s20 will priced as same as the iPhone XS Max 😂😂

<a href="">1:30</a> Shit this isn&#39;t iPhone, where&#39;s the &#39;go back&#39; button?

Paused, watched earlier video as instructed. Thanks for welcoming me back. 😁

2013: bigger displays2020: bigger camera bumps
Roses are redViolets are blueThere is always an Asian company better than you

So I guess nobody went to see the S20 impressions video

It should&#39;ve been a 6000mah.

the best one in reviews ♥️

I did not see the intro song. which one is it?

Ok

Ultra  is what I&#39;m interested in

Please hurry with the review! Lol I wanna upgrade my Note 8 but stuck between note 10 and s20 help me :(

I got something else that’s 7” in my pocket 😉

Samsung only has one thing left to work on, the speakers. Having ok speakers is great but for 1500 dollars all we are paying for is the camera. That&#39;s kind of insane

Not joking I&#39;m still using a moto x2 which has 16GB ROM. LOL!!!

So it&#39;s almost as good as the ROG2 for twice the money.. only thing that&#39;s really better is the updated Snapdragon, screen res and the crazy camera.I still prefer ROG.. just looks better overall and isn&#39;t as much as a full gaming rig PC lol. But I do want that zoom.

Laptops be like , am I a joke to you

When are you doing a give away, cause that&#39;s pretty much how am ever gonna be able to afford such a phone😫 😞😔

I&#39;ve already &quot;SUBSCIBED&quot;  Marques :P

I think the S20 Ultra will suit Joe Goldberg

It so funny how scummy people are against Apple, everybody was calling Iphone 11 pro/pro max ugly and shit because of its camera but now nobody doesnt mind camera on samsung which is 10x times uglier

Mkbkd’s cool touch
I bet Samsung DeX with that 16gb of ram will actually have enough juice to give people a good experience

Apple watches the video 😛

Samsung is going to price itself out of the market.  I, for one, will never pay more than $600 for a smartphone!

&quot;ultra&quot; but still no headphone jack :&#39;(

I would go to non of new Samsung phones, but OnePlus...

Camera review?
<a href="">5:31</a> Alright time to climb a tree and take some photos of my neighbor 😂🤣😂

They Make fun of apple and copy apple. (Camera)

The specs sounds more like a decktop PC

I can officially say that person who give 1400$ for phone is an idiot...

Marques, I know it has single shot for capturing 10 seconds from each camera and photos but can you record just video from all cameras like you can in Filmic Pro on the iPhone 11? Also, what do you think of the stills you can capture from 8k footage?

Peeping at the magic
Image pointing the 100 x zoom at the sun or sky when planes are flying by lmao

Already preordered..gray 128
apple is out

now we waiting for canon and nikon to turn into mobiles.

Imagine how much MB that&#39;s gonna take for a 108MP Image.

Samsung: Its over Apple, I have the high groundApple: You underestimate my power! Samsung: Don&#39;t try it.

108MP?? I really want to know about that sensor size though. There&#39;s nothing weird for a Hasselblad camera to have those many MP because they have the bodies to hold medium format sensors. But, a phone?? Something seems fishy here.

The S20+ also supports both 5G mm wave and sub 6 according to Samsung rep I spoke to today.

Hey guys David here and this is the Samsung S20 Ultra
When a smartphone beats your computer in ram and storage size

Well since the note 10 got best camera, this is pretty much the note with a 108 mp camera, so yes it makes it the best

I just got the 7T Pro 5G McLaren damn now I want this lol

as i wondered maybe like everyone else how do these people get the new phones even before they are released to do videos on Samsung get me in on the game so i can do reviews on new products

Camera bump. Canada bump.
i preordered the s20 ultra black reading all comments and going thru all the youtube vids and getting well versed with the phone even before i get it so i can make my own video and unboxing when I get mine as im in Canada i paid ALOT more for my phone 🤑😀🙃🤑😀

So you&#39;re pretty much buying a $1400 camera.

Yes but no headphone jack

i remember holding my samsung galaxy note 2 with 16 gigs of storage

With this phone I guess you can peep at someone’s destiny

2020 samsung 💓💓💓💓
I want all these specs... but not such a big screen

where can i buy it?

thanks

Oled display???dynamic amoled

Should of used the phone to record this video, that would been awesome

If Samsung would guarantee three years of firmware updates, I’d buy the Ultra.

Then shoot in 60fps!

The S20 Ultra is by far the most beautiful and superior.  I&#39;m totally in love and wish it had an sPen...and yes seriously an sPen.  I&#39;m a Note series person, but the S20 Ultra is quite tempting and has me wondering what the note 20 plus/ultra will be like lol🤔🤔🤔

Does 120hz only work at 1080p on the ultra as well?

Apple could sell a potato for 2000 dollars and people would still buy it

I pre-ordered the S20 Ultra. Go big or go home.

What&#39;s the BGM of start

Ultra.. I&#39;m very intersted

Lol I can&#39;t wait to see what Note 20 Pro Ultra+ is gonna look like on paper.

Can I use it instead of a 100x microscope.

Can you compare it to the Oneplus 7T pro mclaren.

I guess this will be the most wanted phone of 2020

Start at 999? I&#39;d better get an iPhone 11

We are waiting for the ultra as I loved it and for the specs it provides it is future proofed too so what more do we need

Sorry I didn’t switch to the other video.  I’m lazy.

display - 6.9 inch<i>nice</i>

intro music at its best again

&quot;S20 Ultra starting at $1399&quot;Apple: Wait, that&#39;s illegal

I&#39;ll stick with the S10 + for another 3 or 4 years. Epic phone. No new innovation here

So I still have the note 9, I decided not to upgrade to the Note 10 plus primarily because I felt that it wasnt that much of a upgrade. But I just preordered the s20 and I love every feature of it. The s-pen is the only thing I&#39;m losing but I never used it anyway. My question to you is do you think that the s20 will be a good choice? Since the note 9 is still such a great phone

Camera is crazy... and ugly

My galaxy s10 plus is absolutely still amazing for me.

No matter how bigger space it will be difinetly shortage of space in future I mean when you taking lot of picture and video coz it has 108 mp resolution.  Samsung never make a new unique mobile phone.  It similar like Google pixel 4 or iPhone pro or something.  They just copy other&#39;s  idea and they try to make new phone. Sorry to say that.

I am a die hard Samsung customer but they are getting crazy with these prices.

Iphone &quot; bbbut we have emoji&quot;

Most interested in the ultra, but probably going to upgrade to the s20 plus model from the s8+

This phone is insane.

&quot;Subscibed&quot; 🧐 <a href="">7:31</a>
It doesn&#39;t convince me to upgrade my S10+

Instead of making &quot;smaller&quot; versions of their flagship devices (e, s or c), the normal ones are now the cut down.

Do you guys think they will make a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra

Its crazy how galaxy just said fuck it lets make the best phone in history

My favorite was the S5. I have the S10 now. Let me check out this video.

Flossy Carter&quot; S20 is a Certified Beast&quot;.

Can we see Galaxy S20 Ultra vs Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro

Do you all know it&#39;s not exactly a 108 MP AND NOT EVEN AN ACTUAL 10x zoom??

imagine spending over $1399 for a phone running android 🥴
<a href="">7:30</a> I&#39;m <b>SUBSCIBED</b> ! 😅

My brother's father wanted it, but it's very expensive, dude
The phone is ugly

Always check comment section....

<a href="">0:22</a> I&#39;m pretty sure the succession is:S10e = S20S10 = S20+S10+ = S20 Ultra

Whi spotted the neomorphism logo intro?

I was gonna get the note 10 + but I think I just changed my mind

This phone has 16gb RAM and 512 gb ROM, while my laptop has 4 gb RAM and 320 gb Hardisk. 😉 😁

I&#39;m happy with my galaxy s4

I think 100x optical zoom story is a hoax.There are various parameters like white balance, saturation level,colour gamut, sharpness and above all size of image processing sensors which has to be very carefully looked at before designing a mega optical zoom.

Me: thinks my 16 megapixel camera is goodMarques: 108 megapixels

The dislikes on this video are from people without souls.

Missing the side curves on s20

I want that 😭😭😭

Really we need 100 pixel camera in phone?  An ugly looking camera bump up..I don&#39;t see any AI features in this mobile...why people spending huge money on mobile?  Just for camera and 5g features spending $$$$$?

It&#39;s ok I guess.

its so fat phone

MB always hatin on Samsung, headed back to Lou peace

haha i didnt go watch the other video

My computer only has 8 GB of ram..

10 Years from now we&#39;re all going to be looking back at how ugly that huge camera is.

108 megapixels but shitty photos just like the iphone 11.  You CAN&#39;T HAVE GREAT PHOTOS WITH A SENSOR THE SIZE OF A CONFETTI.  Just don&#39;t listen to this commercial shit, and buy a Ricoh GR if you want a real quality camera in your pocket.

S20: 100x Zoom S30: Electron Microscope with Telescope

Can it run Crysis?

This phone is definitely for the perverts and peeping toms lol

I just want my headphone jack

I still have my S8 and while I really like it, I was over the curved screen reeeal quick 🙄 and I also don&#39;t want to upgrade because of the missing headphone jack, ever increasing prices, ugly notches or cameras directly on the screen (instead of being hidden in the bezel) and the removal of expandable memory to force me to buy a higher gb phone.

I just got the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G then they release this jesus.

Did he really think that we skip this vid to watch s10 vid!

Still not a fan of a front-facing camera cutout.

Galaxy S20 = Youtuber&#39;s must have item

I&#39;m still enjoying my note 8

When your phone has twice the RAM of your PC lol

It can Kamehameha the iPhones.....For now....And it will continue....This is the circle of life

If I was Brazilian, give me a like
Watching this on an A71. I feel poor.

Beautiful on the front... one of the ugliest on the rear... 🎛

The end of Nikons and Canons.

The greatest smartphone of all time by some distance

REMEMBERING MY NOKIA PURE VIEW 😖🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
apples 12mp camera still looks better than this 108mp bullcrap lol

Auto captions are missing?

Im using j4 ram is 2gb

2020 display for 2020 camera

Contact Chamatkari Maharaj to get solution of any problem.
Still nothing can beat the design of S9 plus. That phone was the most beautiful phone ever

MKBHD: pause this one, then come back i&#39;ll wait Me: <b>pauses video to read comments</b>

iphone xs max user, it’s it good to switch to the galaxy s20 ultra?

All smartphone reviews videos are : f**k you your poor im rich you will never get this

That zoom is fcking unreal lot of creepy dudes gonna buy it

Apple fanboy

Mkbhd love you respect best YouTuber
We only have 12gb of RAM here.. But, thats still fine with me 🙏 enough memory as it is with 12\128 &amp; you can always buy an sd card for more memory

Should I upgrade from Galaxy Note 10 Plus to S20 Ultra🤷‍♂️

Samsung with the Galaxy S20 Ultra just founded the Stalkers Club. lol

uh was i the only one that got really uncomfortable when he was spinning the phone around in his hand over the edge at <a href="">6:38</a>

2020: Galaxy S20 Ultra2022: Galaxy S20 Ultra Instinct2025: Galaxy S20 God Mode
I&#39;m ready to pre-order the Ultra, trading in my Note 10 Plus. I like the 5G speed I&#39;m getting on my OnePlus 7T 5G McLaren and I can&#39;t wait to see this massive 6.9&quot; screen!

or you could get a nice s6 or s7 and an amazing camera for photos

When people expected for s11, Samsung Made s20 :D

I am going for the S20+ because I think after awhile with having the ultra that HUGE camera bump will start to annoy the heck out of me but this is making me leave my pixel to retire

People need to stop throwing money at flagships. $1400 for a phone that will be topped in a year is stupid. At this point smart phones are commodities. The flagships dont actually net you anything than luxury and brand. Mind you, you can buy a used S9 for sub $200 pretty easily.

Why the fuck arent your videos doing 60fps?

Just give a thicker phone and remove the camera bumps? Could have been a 6000 amp battery they are already so thin k with a case sure it would be way to thick but not every one is so unlucky or stupid to drop his phone

I hope you do a giveaway, with my wedding coming up my wife to be will only let me get this phone if I win it 😂

Lol u are a Apple Lover !!!!!

when a phone has more ram than your gaming laptop

<a href="">1:28</a> nice
DeX?

Yo I&#39;m just going to wait until 2022 until the s20 ultra is being sold for $700

Man the audio in this is satisfying.

These prices are just ridiculous

This phone has more RAM than NASA had on all the Apollo missons combined...Its storage is also triple the storage the Soyuz missions had available until the breakup of the Soviet Union...

That camera thing on the back is hideous

Samsung s20: zoom 100xIphone 12 : microscope
<b>I doubt the battery would last even 15 hours. With 6.9&quot; Screen and 200+ Hz refresh rate, one would need power bank all the times</b>

My only issue is for 1399 you have to provide more than 3 years of slow software updates. It&#39;s ludicrous at this point to think otherwise! -still want the phone though

Pretty much $1,000 of camera and $400 of actual phone. This is made for women who spent their lives taking pictures of themselves and their meals.

Why didn’t they just add a pen and call this the note?

still wanna know where he bought this shirt

i wanna know where he got this shirt, its dope.

my samsung s8 plus phone is still best phone in the world.

Jordan 1🔥😍😍😍
It has 108 MP wide angle camera..u r wrong 🙄

Give away that phone to me please😂

Lens is irrelevant. It’s the sensor that creates the quality and phones can only accommodate a teeny tiny sensor.

So looks like samsung completed the oven range

Razer phone 2 had that display 1-2 years before the samsung s20 ultra!(Watching on my razer phone 2)

Honestly the only thing I&#39;m pissed about is the MASSIVE phone size.I wish the S20 Ultra came in a 6.1 inch size or 5.9, my current S9+ is already hard to use with one hand.I wish phones were more small-hand friendly, shit fucking sucks.

Used to be something called a 7&quot; laptop...

This one run AUTOCAD or ARCHICAD ?! Or maybe CATIA ?  LOL

I&#39;m not coming back!

I got mines pre-ordered through an upgrade program so I&#39;m getting the phone for like £800 because I can trade in my Samsung S9+ to get a £100 discount + the extra £200 O2 is giving me and the phone is like £1,200 here in the UK.

Everytime a galaxy comes out :This is the best display ever

Maybe the phone should be called the &quot;S20 Ultra Flex&quot;

I&#39;m still running my galaxy s8, but shes getting slow and the battery drains faster these days. Eyeing the s20+ probs keep it 4g too

Sounds and looks awesome, can&#39;t wait for it to hit the shelves!!!

Samsung: let&#39;s release a 1399$ phone to all these broke tech enthusiasts. Us geeks that wanna support advancements in technology: well that wasn&#39;t very plus ultra of you

Did NOT watch the other vid

do you think that the s20 ultra will work fine with the osmo 3 gimbal?

@marques: Please upload the Camera Comparison with other flagships!!! This would great help

I have noticed that MKBHD from an impartial assessor had become iPhone fan and Samsung hater. I watch the videos because I hope he would get out of this enchantment but I notice the opposite - the enchantment goes deeper.

Huawei : 50x zoomSamsung : 100x zoomAgain huawei : 500x zoomAgain samsung : 1000x zoomApple : hold my 2x zoom
when a phone gets better than your old shitty desktop pc, you might should upgrade your desktop pc :P

Can you give me this mobile i must need this

iPad will gonna be a pocket phone

Why don&#39;t you record 60fps for particular videos?

Please Give Me.......My Contact No.+91-9993275521 Please Sir

Lots of phone tech is boring. What will I be doing with 16GB of RAM on a phone? Crappy isn&#39;t it!

For me its Ultra

looks like a bad copy of iphone 11 pro

I actually did go watch the other video first lol 😂

I watch you as technical guruji is a b*tch and always uploads in Hindi

I can&#39;t wait to see phone in 10 years from now they are gonna be insane

You could strap on a $8,000 dslr camera to and android and the Snapchat quality will still be the same as an iPhone 3G

This phone can produce 120Hz (40 more than my monitor.)It has almost as much ram as my PC and it has 4k resolution. I might as well run BFV on a phone. Or I should get a super computer

Useless

<a href="">7:33</a> SUBSCIBED.. you mispelled subscribed :)

Honestly wish they would just let apple do their cameras for them just like they&#39;ve been making screens for apple.

wish i have one of that for free

The ipad mini was 4:3 . This is 400:9 hahahaha

Where&#39;s the health sensor? The pulse oximeter sensor??

Oh, a lot of camera together that looks like it doesn&#39;t make me wanna puke.

I will go from a samsung s8 to the s20+ i think

Im german and that camera can do 5x optical and 10x digital.

Them phone prices have gotten  ridiculously too damn high. 20 years from now people will have to make a decision to buy a new 📱 or buy a new 🚘.

8k vid when 4k ain&#39;t even mainstream

You get 6.6 million views and the only test you do with the camera which is the highlight of the model is zooming in on a book haha

Should i go for the s20 ultra it the iphone 11pro max? Please reply 🤔

16 GB RAM and all the latest spec..  Well.. Does it have a &#39;Snake&#39; game like my Nokia 3310?

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you do with your periscope&quot; 😁

they copied apples camera design

we are now in the land of diminishing returns with phones,    if you have the s9 or the s10 the update will not feel substantial.

Who else actually went and watched the video I clicked on this first because it had 108 megapixels in the title but MKBHD said go and watch the first one so I did and I am glad I did otherwise I probably wouldn&#39;t have understood it properly

Loving my M30s...

Watching this on my iPhone 7. I’m guud.

Yeh mkbhd ...........bhai bhai bhai

Maybe the s20+ is the sweet spot but why don&#39;t you try xiaomi MI 10 pro

ULTRA!!!!!

NOOOOOOO!!!! I NEED MY EDGE DISPLAY!!!😭😭😭😭😭
Instagram &quot;models&quot; everywhere are rejoicing &amp; running out to get this phone. Of course in payments. 😂

Marques talking &#39;bout the 108 mpix kamera, and says: &quot;I&#39;ve already made a whole video about this, and I&#39;ll link it below…&quot;Where do I find that link... Or even better the video itself?

<a href="">1:18</a> Materials are another same as s20 and s20+. S20 ultra have stainless steel frame same a iPhone.

This is not a phone 😳
No phone jack - deal killer
Samsung is desperate to keep up on apple

This guy is great. Unbox therapy started doing loot crate scams and other forms of blatant cuckholdery so it looks like this is the spot now

This is crazy af bro

Sounds and looks amazing, so glad they have moved away from the waterfall edge and upped their camera game... But what does this Ultra mean for the Note?

What you say about numbers is very true.

I&#39;m still super pleased with my Galaxy A70.. I&#39;m curious what will be out when it starts to fade on me..

Deez nuts goodem. <a href="">1:34</a>
Officiall end of headphone jack *RIP*.

I&#39;m going to wait for the final review to make my decision but I definitely need an upgrade.

You haven&#39;t actually used this phone. Everything you&#39;ve just mentioned we can look up. Sorry man but your review was now help. Next time actually try the phone out.

Why 865 and not 855?

Arun&#39;s video on Oppo reno 10x zoom too zoomed to moon. No no samsung, you&#39;re just motivating creepsters who spy!

Skip all the S20s go to the Ultra ✊🏽

Pollii sadanam
Samsung has been lazy for a while but man what is the point of this??? Who is this even for? How does this even remotely make my life easier/better for 1400?

The phone looks great but at that price there&#39;s no way.  Phone prices are really getting out of hand.

With all these useless upgrades, we cant even use it to show off over youtube, instagram, facebook, etc coz all photos or videos doesnt support high resolution upload..

No matter how good the hardware is but if they have junk processing   software, camera will still suck!! Biggesr regret is buying s9+ at launch instead of waiting for a couple of months for huawei p30 pro.

hey marques, gime the phone for free

This or Pixel 4 Camera?

Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. how&#39;s the big battery treating?

Is there an &quot;e&quot; version again? I really want a smaller phone and not an iPad mini as you described.

Nice, but no! It&#39;s over kill. However it still looks awesome!

100 times zoom is perfect for stalking lol

Is it a phone or a camera with  a sim option .

Suck next look like note 10 lol are you f*<b>***</b> kidding me Samsung S phones suck

Holy shittttt.....

I wish i could afford this device one day

i want it

Heyyy...it look like iphone 11 camera !😛
A 64 and 128mp camera with a 120hz quad hd screen and 128gb base storage etc. Yeahhhh the new iPhone is going to be shit in comparison

May I ask where did you get that T-shirt? Really cool! Great review

Why don’t you understand people. You guys compare latest 2020 flagship work last years iPhone and declare a winner. But them  releases their new 2020 iPhone they become king again. Lol sand for other companies hahahahahaah

Now Apple will release aphone for 2000$

Samsung runs the phone game, I dont know why everyone is so stuck on iphones.. I&#39;m planning on getting this phone even if it&#39;s more expensive than the best iphone.. it&#39;s worth it

He: welcome backMe: i didn&#39;t go nowhere😂

Please make a zoom video

$1400 but they are too cheap to put in a headphone jack.

I wish I am also the one you to give me at least Samsung S9 Plus..my phone samsung s6 is broke it touch i can&#39;t use it properly and its too old. i want to use Latest samsung flagship. i appreciate so much if you granted my wish..I am also your #1 huge fan always watching your youtube videos..

good one..the best review ever

<a href="">5:37</a>  Ohh, you know... You know exactly what they&#39;re doing...

This phone has more ram than my dam laptop what the hell

I used to be excited about new phones, now they all seem the same.

still not an iphone

The point is the price.. samsung exceeding their price Apple will increase their price of 2020 models aswell then and everyone will just have fun in comments for the price but the truth is these prices are crossing their limits.. no phone makes sense of this price range.

Yo bring back the histogram shirt 🔥

LoL Huawei. Is best
iPhone 6S’s base storage was 16 GB. And that was just five years ago.

Can you do a review on the new Galaxy Buds +

Ultra

100x zoom &amp; 5000mAh battery!! I hope it doesn’t blow off. By the way, you guessed it right, I’m an iPhone user ✌🏻

We need a camera test

So Samsung makes an expensive phone, people stress..  yet Apple has been selling over priced rubbish for ages.. hypocrites.

<a href="">1:15</a> I want this wallpaper

Please make a video for the best bang/buck phone, which one is worth the money in reality. Thank you!

Ohhh I hear the Xiaomi mi 10 pro is the highest ranked phone on DXO marks at the moment, hope this phone&#39;ll beat it!!!

So this is bigger than any note. Will the the note still be relevant? How can they make it different to this

Nobody got time for that , I&#39;m skipping your this video now .

Attach the phone with high zoom to a drone: pervs and pedophiles getting excited.

Marques The G.O.A.T.

This guy only likes Samsung and iphones if it was Lg with that bump in the back...

This phone got more RAM than my both laptops COMBINED...

Design mmmm going backwards...
The Galaxy S20 Ultra cannot do 960FPS super slow mo, but the normal S20 and S20+ can.

Your intro&#39;s always wake my kid up. -.-

I went to watch the other video then came back to &quot;ok welcome back&quot; Right on time 🕺🏾

I like your rainbow carpet

Dont tell me what to do, bitch!

Isn&#39;t it funny how they have such a massive jump in name from s10 to s20, yet it&#39;s the smallest innovation since the s series of phones 😬

It doesnt automatically mean the camera us better but it is better

Do you allow to record 4k video longer than 5 minutes?

The phones are fantastic yet i&#39;m still using a 512MB RAM, 4GB storage phone and i believe its the slowest &quot;smart&quot;phone in the world!!!

i am buying the ultra

S20 Ultra vs ROG phone II???
Lagai from Syria lost my family in the war and needed help

He seems salty he doesn&#39;t have 5G yet 🤣

i love samsung
I kinda like my &quot;old&quot; s10e, I mean I use the backpack for the laptop and all I have left are regular pockets...

The S20 ultra&#39;s display is 1 sq inch smaller than an ipad mini&#39;sLet that sink in

When note 20 ultra flip?

Can&#39;t wait to see what OnePlus comes out with this year

Can you give me that phone

Like Flossy says...the price IS TGH 👊🏼 for me 😟
I&#39;d stilkl choose my all screen mi mixx 3

In hopes that Samsung&#39;s software is even remotely close to the Pixel&#39;s, I&#39;m going to pick up the S20 Ultra... I may wait to see some camera comparisons though.

How about a telescope instead of 108 MP camera😇   &amp; Encyclopedia ^Encyclopedia instead of 512/T....😈&amp;&amp;∞

This phone already scores more than I did in my 14 years in school and 5 years in college

This dude is boring.... 🤷🏻‍♂️
&quot;It&#39;s a 6.9 inch [...] display, which is <b><i>nuts</i></b> ... It&#39;s just <i>absolutely massive</i> to have that nearly 7-inch screen in your pocket.&quot;Oh, Marques. 😏

In future we may have a phone that can zoom into other Galaxies

camera pixel 108 fake pixel just number I think huawei p30 pro camera is mach better 😏

Skeptical on the MP counts about how they perform. In-camera composites? Either way, it’s still on in a camera phone.  Not going to look at good as interchangeable lens cameras for DOF.

I didn’t know cameras came with phones!

Why stop at 4 cameras? Just go balls out and make the entire back a camera.

Good

Wow

Ultra forever
We No need 100x zoom
NO ONE realizes THAT THIS HAS SLOFIE?!?!?
I disable Bixby over Google

Nokia, Motorola did mistake not switching on anoroid. Samsung IPhone took all market.

This man is Anti Samsung

RAM byte is the same as my desktop...

MAN ITS UGLY.

I lovd samsung brand the best .but my money only cam afford a midrange Samsung  phone

i guess this is the first phone that actually looks huge in marques hands

1399 usd for a phone: No, thanks!

This back is really ugly

What a huge disappointment: No 4K video at 120 Hz!

What a huge disappointment: No 4K video at 120 Hz!

What a huge disappointment: No 4K video at 120 Hz!

This guy has more ram than my pc

Can phone makers stop adding more cameras and just start making a single jaw dropping one. DSLR level.

<a href="">0:44</a> aint nobody got time for that

My s10+ is doing great ill stick with it

Year by year , smartphones gonna cost same as your motorcycle

cile st

WORTH IT

Ultra

Does it have wireless powershare like the S10 and N10 did?

Unfortunately, Samsung is still married to Android. The only deal-breaker for all Samsung phones in my opinion. If they made their own software and convinced google to let them do it, they would have tremendous changes. Like Iphones, things like SnapChat and the front camera would feel extremely smooth. No matter how good the hardware is, there is always that &quot;Android LAG&quot; that feels disappointing.

Do a comparison vs the Xiaomi Mi 10 pro

Well shit. No more relying on samsung for the best phones while cheap.

Wait... Why 240Hz tho?

S20 Ultra definitely. Unless a better phone comes out from one of the other phone companies.

But can it make a phone call ?

<a href="">7:02</a> You wrote all that on the phone.

Apple : lets launch a $1500 iphone

<a href="">1:38</a> Whose foot is that?

I did not see the S20 video.........are you angry?

Why am I watching this when I just have an S7 with a cracked screen 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

In this case, rockstar please port GTA V on android

Almost as ugly as the iPhone 🤮

People in 2007: “oh my phone has a camera”2020:”oh my camera has a phone”

Thick phone for best battery

I better be able to call obama if im gonna buy a phone for 1,400 dollars

Well that crazy zoom will come in handy when you are travelling I guess - imagine, you can now zoom in properly and take a great photo of that iguana ;)

Very reasonable and unbiased points as always, this is why you&#39;re a great tech reviewer!

What&#39;s it with Pajeets and new releases   ? Flooding the comment sections with stolen memes

Marques “But” Brownlee
<a href="">5:55</a> when you cant point anything Samsung doesnt have Than you just dislike their developed featuresSmh

What I&#39;m more interested in is why this phone is dangling over the ledge at <a href="">6:23</a>... Just please take like 2 steps back, my palms are sweaty.

At school in the hallway I used wrap photo  film in aluminum foil set it on fire too create an awesome smoke bomb.. The whole school would get evacuated .... i miss those days

but does it have imessage

Great video 👍. I&#39;m going for the ultra or the note 20 if they make it. I have an S9 plus so I&#39;m waiting for Android 10 on the Verizon network. By August after the note comes out I will make the decision.

Ugh. This thing is hemorrhaging gimmick after gimmick after gimmick. Samsung doesn’t care about making the UX awesome. They only care about what their devices look like on paper. It still has a tiny sensor  so 108 megapixels is so useless. All it’s doing is taking up farrrrrr more memory on your phone. Or forcing you to pay for cloud storage, or buy a ton of extra physical memory for the thing. It isn’t a well thought out execution and it’s so obvious. Instead of packing a device to the brim with crap like ram and megapixels they ought to think about how they can make their devices more optimized for a better experience.

iphone 11pro max: no one can beat me Samsung s20 ultra: hold my beer..

Subsribe my channel please

2k 4k 8k resolution video Ram increased to few kB to 16 GB of ram, Camera resolution increased to VGA to 108 mp .Where will these rat race end in terms of insane specs.

6.9 inch display. Nice
welcome to ugly phone design ...
Fyi, Huawei and Oppo periscope lens are from Samsung Israel subsidiary Corephotonics

It&#39;s a very fast and capable spyware. People should stop for a second and ask why they (big tech companies) need to own so much information from us with such subtle details? We are we willingly giving them the access to own our life by supporting their new &quot;products&quot;

Love it

Apples got some work to do for the iPhone 12

Didn’t expect this from Samsung,now even they have turned greedy to attract noobs

who the hell is going to film their kids&#39; soccer game in 8K??!!

Samsung:We have 108 megapixelsNokia: 108mp, at $2000, we have 240mp for only $500

$2000,😣
The camera bump is a 💣

Can&#39;t wait to see how that Space Zoom perform, I&#39;m liking that 40 mg front camera and larger display. Samsung may get that 1399 from me.

Maybe someone will finally find sasquatch.

the phone is good just the colors can be better and the price can be lower

S20+ worth upgrading
Peace ✌️
I honestly don&#39;t like the way it looks and prefer the standard S20s. The Ultra looks chunky in the wrong places.

I know a way for you to show the refresh rate use a slow mo shot I am pretty sure your red can handle it

Nice Jordans!
Samsung: 16gb ram phoneMe: cry in 4gb ram laptop

Still no FaceTime

And everybody said Apple was gonna have soooo many cameras

Samsung Is GOD.
Any only apple users change to android? Considering

Can you still call someone though?

Please can you review the Samsung A71 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

It better take pictures the same resolution of my eyes or im gonna kill somebody

Ultra rules for me but first I need to see que Oneplus 8T McLaren edition

I will take one!You know as well as all of us.. if Apple comes out with the same cameras.. we would be praising it more then you are now.. I have a iPhone XS...if the iOS 12 doesn’t deliver... I will be going back to Samsung.Mahalo for the video

Cool phone but will be forgotten about because Samsung won’t update the software after 2022

My gf will need that 100x zoom

You need to get a normal sized hands person to hold this for you.

Damn your hair cut ugly asf

Fuck right off Samsung.

You talk about a mobile like it was a NASA spacial transponder...&amp; you know something? it is not.

I bought my Hyundai elantra 1.6 motor with 13000km on it with zero problems for less than 1300$   in sweden 🇸🇪 , phones are getting really expensive men thats alot of money for a fucking phone that just do the same shit that any other phone since 2015 does. We just keep buying just because of “” yea why not “” . That’s stupid 🙂

Am getting this one

They’re in the 20th already tf

$1400 and no headphone jack and IR blaster. 😒

Does this mean all Samsung users are now gonna have better insta stories or nah?

Google pixel and iPhone users hit a thumb👇🏾

It&#39;s the LeBron james of phones...A Locomotive coming at you at full speed!!!

Samsung make great phones and always new things add to their phones

6,9 inchesnice

Samsung: 16gb RAMMe: my phone 16gb storage am ok no big difference 🤔🤔🤣🤣
They should call it: Quick Flex

Once Samsung realized that customers would pay more than $1.2k they went crazy over the price of Flagship phones.

thanks Apple

it's expensive
6,358,240 - 4,439,796 = 1,918,444View for S20 Ultra minus views for S20 and S20+Looks like ya&#39;ll been cheating here.

Nice bro ...from 🇵🇰

Bro I use s3 mini, I follow it so much, don't you have a conscience, would you die if you gave your brother a nice gift 🎁? Hiiii
Nice

Hey Marques, nice one theres. What’s the name of your wallpaper behind you? Can I get a link to where you got it? Want to get some for my new place. Would appreciate the help. Thanks

<a href="">5:03</a> OMG...

I used to like it when the word to use before ‘pro’ or Ultra’ or whatever was Turbo. Everything was turbo. Even turbo sunglasses lol

100 times zoom to see the aliens

Soon if Samsung keeps on going the way it is we will explore the new galaxies with the phone but I have I phone just because the app and google maps looks too good in it..

This shit sick fham I rather get this not yeo

<a href="">1:31</a> oops it&#39;s Samsung 😂❤❤
Awful design
No under display camera, so old tech here. I&#39;ll wait

I&#39;d never thought that I&#39;d see 16G Ram, and 108 megapixel camera, 40 megapixel selfie, and 8K video on the phone in 2020....Samsung did again!!

S20 ultra HAS NO SNAPDRAGON 865 in Europe, it has Exynos 990 which is 20% slower (but is doesn&#39;t cost less money). Many europeans will miss that fact and wont understand why gameplay isn&#39;t stable and smooth all the time on their device. For Europeans, if you want the best, the s20 series aren&#39;t because of this.

Hey marq do you think it’s worth it to upgrade from an iphone xs max to this ? I like watching videos on my phone mainly youtube\snapchat and gaming so I definitely dig the bigger screen and I’m sick of the face lock and want to use the fingerprint thing like the old days

Honestly prices on flagship phones r getting bizzare...next gen price will prolly be within 3000 dollar range...

There is no sub-6 in Malaysia and some other countries in my region. Also, S20 and S20+ that will be sold in my region will not support 5G completely.

Still snapchat will suck on it

You know it&#39;s crazy tech when there is ZERO talk of call quality!

do you think that there is a note  version is coming?\

&#39;Ultra&#39; is Samsung&#39;s version of &#39;Pro&#39;, they dont throw that word around as gratuitously as some other manufacturers right now.Im dying😂

But it doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack..

I don&#39;t even use the camera on my phone that much...

15,510 comments - you will need an AI machine to read them.  Telephoto lens and 100X zoom is great for construction sites.

Don’t see the link to the 108mp camera video.

Yo Marques. Am a fan of yours but after watching so many of your reviews on Samsung phones I noticed a subtle sarcasm and fallacy towards Samsung devices. Are you on Apple&#39;s payroll? You should be grateful for how Samsung is pushing technologies forward unlike Apple. Your reviews used to be neutral and informative which helped greatly in the past when it came to packing that purchase decision. Now you seem very bias. Come clean to us please.

My brain-s20 ultraMy heart-s20 plusMy hands-s20

6.9 inches. Nice

Welcome to my channel that provides the best voices for the recitations of the Holy Quran.

Sniper version of smartphones camera

Does its camera look as good as a professional camera Help me out Should I get a iPhone 11 and a professional camera                 OrA samsung s20 ultra

I don&#39;t like big phones. One hand should be able to hold it comfortably while my other hand is busy. If you know, you know.

Why I have a feeling that MKBHD now-a-days does not recommend any other smartphone other than Apple iPhone.😜😜

s u b s s u b s here returned help
When phone getting 40mp selfi cameraAnd i  have still mobile with 16mp main camera 😂

16gb ram is a dream come true for emulation

The day a smartphone became a laptop in the pocket !

No headphone jack?
Finally I&#39;m going to capture UFO&#39;S now🤓🤓🤓

&quot;why did Samsung and apple skip 9?&quot;&quot;bcz 7, 8, 9&quot;

I only have one camera on my phone

I got to $1400... do the people who buy these lie/pretend they brought the cheaper verion to avoid judgement? Anyone on here thinking they need this?

RIP headphone jack
Not sure why mmwave is supported on Ultra but not on S20,althought both have same SD865modem

40 mp front camera? Come on, that&#39;s just retarded.

This s**t is getting boring. There is nothing unique at all just big numbers.. my s8 is still working just fine.

Will you buy S20 or face mask? Pick your choice.

And here i am with my galaxy s7...

Great 👍👍
One + 7t Pro is unbeatable

Add the word IMPRESSIONS at the very start of the video. Because as of now, it is worthless as it is. I am in for reviews and not for a quick glimpse and a tease.

Jesus they are making phones uglier each year

Why is Samsung more expensive then a iPhone?

2025: Samsung is more branded than appleMe with Samsung: I want apple!!

Me: is that a gas stove on the back?The S20 camera looking at me like wtf

The world of technology is more complex than medicine now

Dynamic amoled display

Hi Marques,You are very well explanation for all videos .Peace✌️ we are following @Turkey.Honestly,you are hearty video.

That phone chunky

Samsung Cheat .... they should have Samsung S11 first.. they jumped staright to S20

Hello everyone.. Good day.! I’m New on YouTube. I knew MKBHD most popular channel at all time. Thats why i came here for promote my channel.. Please check it out my channel &amp; subscribe for Logo Designs. I hope you support us.. Thanks👍🏽

Why they don&#39;t launches Samsung Devices with snapdragon in India even though exynos is a good processor still many people prefer snapdragon 😐😐😐😐😐😐 this really feels bad they are destroying their own market bcz india plays a big role in market shares as people are just crazy  heir in buying devices when they comes to market

Bring on the 7 Inch phones!!!

is &quot;Call&quot; feature still in there?

Might as well make the whole back the camera now, damn

In vietnam, s20 ultra only 1150$

i want that but idont have money

I read that Qualcomm Modem X55 used in S20 series supports all bands of 5G frequencies i.e. low, mid and high bands. Then, why is it that different models of S20 Ultra are offering selected frequencies only for 5G. Is the limitation due to the fact that different frequencies require different antennas in addition to the X55 Modem and there is not enough space in the phone to accommodate all these antennas? But, I see no such limitation for 2G, 3G and 4G bands as S20 series is offering virtually all the bands for 2G to 4G. Is it because only a few antennas are required for 2G to 4G?

It&#39;s here, it&#39;s ugly

No curved screen :(

In India s20 ultra is cheaper than 11 pro..lol😂When is apple going to do something about it🤷‍♂️

I had a 5100mah in the Lenovo P2... so this is the least they could do. Impressive nonetheless, what sucks with Samsung though is that we in Europe get the shitty Exynos. Snapdragon version is MUCH faster in multicore, as usual.

This guy is paid by apple to mock Samsung

P30: U can zoom the moon.S20: Behind moon.

Even tho the phone is so big, it still looks small in Marques&#39; hand 😂

I&#39;m still using my fkn core prime.

This is why I choose Samsung every time! And in my opinion, my s8+ s9+, and s105g all had amazing cameras. I was even complimented by an iphone user who&#39;s phone was six months newer. So there&#39;s that.

LMAO this phone has as much RAM as my gaming PC.

2019: Phone that comes with a camera2020: Camera that comes with a phone

Samsung needed that 45w charger money damn. I see a switch to the new oneplus in a few months when the hype dies down.

I like turtles.

Samsung releases phone with 16 Gb ramand My phone still has 16 GB internal storage : (

Insane

Samsung releases a new flagship:Everyone: <b>this is the best Display Samsung has ever made</b>

Go to r/android on reddit. Seems like people are finding out Samsung has lied about some camera specs on their new s20, s20pkus and s20 ultra. There’s a few upset people in there. Did Samsung lie?

In 2021 this device will cost adequate amount of money and we can talking about it )

Nice video

They should&#39;ve called it Samsung galaxy s20 + ultra ;)

2032:the whole back has camera&#39;s

Soon we r gonna see a camera with a “ calling option” as the highlight.

The hell you gon do with 16gb of ram? 8gb is sufficient, they should make the chips faster and more efficient in terms of battery consuming not stacking rams up.

Ouch, Samsung finally got 108MP.Xiaomi got a new challenger.

What about software support?

Until new iphone comes in

S20

OF COURSE ITS WORTH 1399!

I have an iPhone XR about to change to galaxy s20

S20 ₹67,000S20+ ₹74,000S20 Ultra ₹93,000iPhone 11 Pro ₹100,000And $1000 iphone 11 pro sold for $1500 in India.We must apperciate samsung👏👏
So no heart rate sensor
Next: Samsung Galaxy S80 with 8,992832 megapixelsPrice:$1293840Me: Ahh shit here we go again. I need to sell my other kidney, again.

So, basically they made this phone for espionage.

huawei: we are first to have 50x zoom into the moonSamsung: 100x zoom into the space, wow i see captain Marvel

Hi sir, i really like your videos and i really like the way you actually review the products. I just want you to upload a video on apple service. The way they take huge amount of money for nothing. Apart from that on their exchange scheme. Which we pay more than half the amount of the product to get back the same product. I really want a video on that coz companies listen to you. And Please guide me and contact me if you can help me with my iphone 8 plus issue.

Anyone have the link for the video he mentioned at <a href="">4:24</a> about the main camera?

<a href="">1:30</a> I saw him try to do the iPhone backswipe

did you changed your mic? it is very &quot;echoed&quot; (dont know the real term).

It all sounds delightful.but I have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking  about..I just dont understand interpreting specs!?! Is it just me? Im not tech savy and have a Note 9..er still not entirely sure how to use my S pen 🙈. Must be showing my age!

U need a stand for the 100 zoom..

i`ll wait till august or so for the price to drop a little bit and i`ll get the ultra!

is it me or galaxys phones are getting more expensive than iphones

S10 ke bad s11 nhi sida s20 Samsung things aur back camera ka design apple se Liya lagta hai

Meh

Now where&#39;s that winning lottery ticket?? Mmm...

I am sorry but this is the problem with society. Tablets dont emphasize their cameras. It is based mostly on performance. Why do cell phones make it a main focus to broadcast the capabilities of their cameras? Social media has forced phones to go into this direction. I purchase devices based on performance and functionality

Never count digital zoom as zoom. Ever.
It&#39;s less money than IPhone 11 Pro max and much better than IPhone too

Imagine 12/16 gb ram AND snapdragon 865

Ultra impression!
On October 4, 2019, the Dutch national newspaper Trouw published a report with the headline “Tribunal names China a criminal country.” 



The opening paragraph read:



“The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has seized power for seventy years. Let us review it together.”



The subsequent text described the CCP’s harvesting of organs from living Falun Gong practitioners and the final judgment of the independent China Tribunal in London earlier this year.





Dutch national newspaper Trouw carries a report entitled “Tribunal names China a criminal country” on October 4.



The article stated that the China Tribunal&#39;s investigations were based on solid evidence and firsthand testimony.



“In order to get live organs and kill people, CCP doctors select organs when the victims are still alive,” the author wrote.



“As early as 2006, there have been reports that the Falun Gong practice group is the main target. The CCP’s live organ harvesting crimes from Falun Gong practitioners was confirmed by the Tribunal. In addition, the China Tribunal also suspects that an ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that the killing for organs also occurs on Uighurs.”

My Samsung s5 cam zoom Donald Trump from Bosnia on toilet in White House

Are you are about only the Ultra having mmWave? I thought the plus had it too.

Fun fact: no one does zoom that much in any time in their life

watching this on my s8 plus any one ?

Glue on a domino.When my note 8 dies New phone&#39;s / camera 2023 imagine

Only MKBHD can hold a 6.9 inch phone and make it look regular sized.

The thing about Samsung is that, when you process the photos in a photo editing app the result is really bad. The quality is not good unlike iPhone, huawei and LG phones I I think they have considered this aspect.

I will never pay to a phone more than 700 usd. No matter how much i earn. I think its really a waste since there will be better version coming next year.

How ironic he uses the apple watch series 5 😂

Awesome video bro I like the way you do your job 👏👏

I&#39;ve yet to see a phone review where anyone actually talks about it&#39;s ability to make &amp; receive calls...

But Sony is freaking out about asking 500 for the PS5

You know what we will be doing with that zoom😎

All these smart “phones” are way too massive.  Cannot wait for these manufacturers evolve deeper into the 21st century.  I’ll wait for the new foldable flip phones.

I think phones are bad for your eyesight. When will tablets take over

Joe: you said 100x zoom ?
What&#39;s ur favourite phone !!?

Hi

When you take good pictures of someone but they look away because of the camera

You are always bias you never talk well about samsung .....unfollowing asap

<a href="">6:00</a> No Marques, Lumia 808 and 1020 had the BEST smartphone Camera for years..

if this was running win10, im in !

The S20 Ultra is overpriced and a niche product. And if you are using 100X Zoom that would be really creepy in most cases.

You are ugly as fuck marques

Marques can you please do a review on laptops that are suitable for students in 2020 please. Thank you I appreciate it.

Man, these phones are getting crazy. I love galaxies, but for me it&#39;s still simple, I like small phones with my goddamned jack! Phones are tools, they have to fit to my use and not the other way around.. so if new phones have 20 inch screens, fold 7 times and send signals to Jupiter, awesome! But I still want screens that fit in my hand and headphones that don&#39;t need battery. Call me crazy.

I just got a new phone 😢

Ultra

Ultra or z
just got the note 10+, wish I didn&#39;t rush out to replace my dying iphone. done with apple, love owning my files!

I&#39;m at the point with smartphones that I would rather get something like Nokia 7.2 because it has Android One and it&#39;s good enough. I don&#39;t like bloat, and I don&#39;t honestly see any reason to get flagship phones anymore. And I have had flagship phones since iPhone 4. I&#39;m just regular phone user,  though I like to customize my phone with nova launcher and such. I need battery life, decent camera and small bezels. Unless you game on your phone, you just don&#39;t need massive performance. Only games that need that amount of power are rpg and fps games and it&#39;s just crappy experience no matter how you go about it. There&#39;s literally no reason to get flagship aside from being amazed at it for a while and then you just do all the same things in it you could have done in your previous phone or some cheaper phone.I would buy Samsung phones if they made Android One versions, I would even be willing to even pay some extra. I think Samsung still makes the best phones. Though I don&#39;t think I would buy anything that&#39;s more than $600. As technology has gotten better, my priority has changed to OS and price. Because you can pretty much ignore specs and even low end phones have decent camera and small bezels.

In Marques we trust

Maybe hacker could do something with the zoom

<a href="">6:25</a> The moment you notice he&#39;s holding a $1400 phone over the edge of a balcony

Camera still sucks..even 12mp pixel and Nokia can beat this What a joke from Samsung just failed with the camera And the design so ugly almost like iPhone 11 even Im not Apple fansPls came out with your fresh phone idea of design Getting expansive same like apple U know smartphone price will drop  Samsung from top now at bottom So many model come out so fast please don&#39;t be like other smartphone (Chinese) brand Poor Samsung

after he said 1400 dollars I just stopped watching, no piece of crap that will be obsolete as soon as I buy is it worth that much

Killer camera
Here I am thinking should I buy S20ultra or a new bike.

Competition is great for business...I love the times we’re living in...

Camera looks UGLY.
This video has 6M views and that video @mkbhd is asking us to watch before this has just 4.3M views. People: don&#39;t worry we will understand what u say

At this point, Samsung is just coming off as try hard like redmi, OPPO etc, with gimmicks and marketing stunts. For one thing, Apple has done its marketing right.

I never left why are u welcoming me

I feel gansta when i did not click on the other video and just kept wachting this video

The camera bump should not matter, any sane person buys a good protective case anyway

Apple: this year we should make a camera which turn to a phone

Can you please next time talk about safety on Android phones

Wow! 100X zoom every stalker will going to love it..Love From India

I pre-ordered mine on Wednesday! I&#39;m excited. I currently have the S10+ so hopefully it won&#39;t be too big 😂

I&#39;ll wait some 5 years until this technology becomes commonplace and affordable

cmon bruh samsung isn&#39;t that bad they did perfect justice which iphone never thinks of. The price is perfect because these aint mi 108 cameras but they are samsung&#39;s. apple sells a phone at 1400$ with an 18 W charger. A note 10 or an S10 or oneplus 7t is a better buy then 11maxpro

All the phone upgrades of the last two years seems pointless to me except for higher refresh rates. I don&#39;t feel the desire to buy a new phone and my HTC U11+ is from 2017. It&#39;s not only that I don&#39;t need it, I just don&#39;t want to, whereas with cars and clothes and watches it always happen to me  that I&#39;d like to buy more. Phones used to feel the same way to me. I think that&#39;s a symptom of the smartphones companies not being able to offer significant functionality upgrades in the last two years.

Will apple in September able to show up?....this is big even though on paper...Cupertino hope u have smthng up ur sleeve.

WHAT????. My laptop is 8gb ram and this phone is 16gb. OOHH NOO

Regular S20 is going to be my way to go.

Hilarious a bit when a Phone gets 16gb RAM while my PC still runs 4gb RAM...Hilariously Painful though... 🥴

Well I guess that 100x zoom equals no excuses for capturing poor quality Cryptid vids.

This makes my iPhone 11 looks 5 year old. Good Job Samsung

MM
I think next nikon/canon will make phone better than Samsung and Apple

But apple have superior emojis 😂

Already pre-order my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra! Bye Apple 😌Apple Iphone X User
You can spot your girlfriend&#39;s pimples miles away.
Make your phone beach!

Wow I am the person who made this new word PHODSLR.

Just a few months away from making a phodslr.

I don&#39;t understand why Samsung copied iPhone Design?

The camera technology of this mainstream junk was stolen from Huawei p30 pro .

Pricey

Way too expensive, waiting for apples answer to that... i think will be much better option

Spec is insane. This might finally push me to buy a Samsung phone

Do ROG phone 2 vs S20 line

i could never spend that money for a phone with a giant hole in the screen

Wow! You talk so clear and educated!

They should have release this 3 years from now to early

Wtf 108MP

How did you get the phone before release date?

Wtf 16 GB ram???...my i5 laptop has 4gb ...

I am looking for kidney jokes in the comment section!

When phones have 16 gb ram, but my pc only have 4gb.

Dear MKBHD I am a Subscriber to you and a regular viewar. I want to know the problems that the Oneplus 7t pro mclaren edition 5G had?

Bring back taking video on pro mode please!!!

You guys are hitting all over the place
S20 Ultra- Im the Champ!Note 20 Ultra- Hold my lens brotha😂😂😂

India has been paying $1500 for iPhones since iPhone 8 launch so now same pricing model is being followed in the US as well

Samsung is the Fashion Nova of technology

100 MP digital zoom = 100 MP of BS.
Ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra! TJ Combo Wins
Samsung in 2022: &quot;Our phones are no more fingerprint magnet. We have achieved it by filling rear of the phone with 32 lenses. No place to put your fingers on...!!!&quot;

12/16 GB RAM? That&#39;s more RAM than my laptop...

I am in for the Flippy screen one!!

I don&#39;t like iPhones, but when other brands make ugly sensors no one says anything about it

Malayalikal undo
Show some pictures or images taken vs quality dumb.

16 gb of ram my phone calls are going to have insane fps bro

Why does everybody think Big screen = Good screen?

I need a new wallet its ripped( Literally) , I hope that they come up with wallet In ? Or On ? the phone, that will be awesome!!!!!

Im an Android user but somehow I agree on the 12mp Iphone vs 100mp samsung. How I wish Samsung make better camera than Iphone.

<b>Marques asks to watch his previous video</b>       <b>Literally this video having more views than his previous video*.                                               *Marques: Am I a Joke to You</b>

At this point I don’t even care anymore about phones what a waste of money now 😂 so much more you could do with 1500

im so excited for when the note comes... who knows what samsung has under its sleeve for that... im pretty sure the note20 is going to be a monster

Ultra

I&#39;m waiting for the next Galaxy Note Plus or the Galaxy Note Ultra phone... will probably be about $1,500, but I&#39;m still using the Galaxy S8+, which still works well and looks awesome, so I&#39;ve had time to save $$$... I&#39;ll be crying &amp; kicking myself once I spend it though... lol... I spent $1,500 on the Apple iPad Pro 12.9 256gb with accessories... it was almost worth it- minus the $180 dead beat keyboard...

It&#39;s funny how we thought the &quot;Galaxy Mega&quot; from 2013 was huge (6.3&quot;) and nobody would buy.. and now ppl are buying (6.9&quot;) phones for 1400$.What a crazy little world we live in. :/

Next year 144hz display😀

Remember when the most important part of a phone was the SOUND and if you can hear the other person&#39;s voice clearly 😂

Liked the new intro with neomorphism 😊

1400 euro for an mid end exynos cpu in Europe...

Nice intro. Airpods pro suck
what is that small black dot under the flash in the quad camera setup?????

Compare ultra wide with iphone specifically it has larger sensor check quality

Rip apple Samsung destroys apple
Now i will  see a lice for my grandmother using optical zoom galaxy s20 ultra

HAHAHAHAHA WHAT THE F

My parents live under the flight path of an Air Force base.  That 100x would be great to capture the aircraft flying overhead.

Just discovered your channel a few weeks ago...wish I would&#39;ve found earlier...great job~~ I was wondering if you knew the names of the companies making the cameras/sensors in the S20s? I know there are multiple camera companies but can&#39;t seem to find which companies are making the cameras for this galaxy version. Thanks for answering and wish you continued success on the channel.

where is the video about the 108Mp camera he&#39;s talking about at <a href="">4:32</a> ?

16G RAM or what?????

I phone 👉👉 copy Samsung
Dear Mr. Brownlee , please compare the photocapability to the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 . I like to know if it has the same edgeproblems with the quality in photos. Its the same sensor , it should ^^ . You know alot about camtech, please tell us why that is 👍🏿😁

Did he just say &quot;bleeding edge&quot; ???lol

S20 ultra
Sony used to rule all with image sensors.Now it&#39;s becoming yesterday&#39;s news

Please review Galaxy tab S6

Im going to wait for black friday 😑😏

Dood I&#39;d be low-key scared to buy this phone even if I had the money

Marques gets phones so early Samsung gave him an S20 but we have to go through S10,11,12,13.....

all cameras backsize10years later

i miss the headphonejack.

ultra of course

I noticed the breds before the actual phone lol

Who tha fuccckk puts a 20sec ad... Seriously man.. Wtf

Ask for one, dude 👀
Ah, and there we go with the &quot;Oh apple products are better&quot; and the &quot;Oh Samsung is the best&quot;Like y can&#39;t we jusSay that apple and Samsung products are good.

I need 1399 bucks :)

homie forgot about the selfie cam

What makes this phone expensive is just the camera, the camera that we don&#39;t need.

Just now pre booked S20 ultra ..very exticted to have in hands. Bye bye my s10+

And iPhone users will still beleive that their phone is better 😂

Hi Marques I asking you for a favour If you can give me this S20 Ultra as a gift And I will be appreciated that

Iphone 11 Pro or This Samsung?

So.. where is the camera video?

I&#39;m honestly between the ultra and the s20+. Not sure if the camera and battery will be worth the extra $200

You know you broke when a android phone has better spec than your pc😔

Xiaomi mi 10 pro half the money more beautiful design 💸💸

I still love ❤️ iPhone 📲
The Samsung software + bloatware is still terrible. I cant buy Samsung until they sort this out.

Support me 🙏

TRUMP will have this phone banned in the USA due to its 100x zoom. Will think its a spy tool.

hey please review about Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro.

Sooooooo the note isn&#39;t the ultra Flagship anymore? I don&#39;t know what Samsung is doing anymore with all the different phones that they&#39;re throwing at us but at least they&#39;re naming scheme is easier to follow than Sony&#39;s

Yeah the weird black rear camera bump is becoming a trend in the smartphone industry,like how fake exhaust tips on m0st cars now.

What brand watch are you wearing?

If Samsung Doesn&#39;t Release A Son Goku UI Themed Variant Of This, I Will Literally Buy An iPhone.

<a href="">3:13</a> beautifull shoot i loved it
Starting at $1,400 Samsung and I aren&#39;t speaking the same language at all also I intensely dislike the back design I hated it on the iPhone, on the Samsung it just reminds me of a six burner stove

Wait till xiaomi bring out a phone with similar specs but 1/4 the price

wouldn&#39;t it become 1 Gigapixel already?

how fast is the charging speed?

Why S10 to direct S20 because of its 2020 ? Just curiosity..

Talk to me when they make something practical like technology for having the camera behind the display and appear when you use it so they don&#39;t have that ridiculous hole punch at the top of the phone.

Regular S20

Hole punch still a fail

Watching this in my galaxy s8. Eeeeerrrrrr.....

damn ADs they are everywhere 🤯

&quot;Mark-ass Bownleyy&quot;

How does this compare to the Note 10 Plus? Is 120hz really THAT much faster, for example? I was really looking forward to getting the Note 10 Plus, but now, I am not so sure.

Without spen. It is Garbage!

This guy is so deeply in Samsung&#39;s pocket, it&#39;s not even funny!

Samsung is showing off now, finally.

Jahntu phone
No matter how much costly it is, we will be able to buy it for 300 to 500 dollars within year 2022.. 😄😄 I&#39;m gonna buy it than... 😄😄

I am waiting for Alon Musk to come up with his phone... it will be called PhoneX, and will be run by hydrocells!

You need it for fancams lmao

can anyone subscribe me ?

Because of this phone, you can just buy a GenAd seat on concerts and zoom in on the artists faces

2 months later: Oneplus offers 216 MP cameras in their phones, at half the price. 😁😁

) Forbes magazine published an article by Ewelina U. Ochab titled “Organ Harvesting in China and The Many Questions to Be Answered” on October 16, 2018.



In the article, Ochab stated that the claims that China&#39;s communist regime is killing prisoners of conscience, and in particular Falun Gong practitioners, to supply its organ harvesting industry, are supported by substantial evidence.





Forbes said that the Chinese communist regime harvests organs from Falun Gong practitioners.



She stated that organ transplantation is a highly regulated medical procedure, and the World Health Organization has produced a publication called the Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation to clarify international standards for organ transplantations.

Reminds me of them Chinese that put 100 megapixels on the box but in reality there are only 5.

looks like the smartphones technology reached its top

No jack no party
Nothing else to say, just ew.

So cool asf
&quot;6.9 inch which is nuts&quot; I like that part.

Samsung guyz are renewing interfaces and launching new technologies but why people are still fond of using iphones which have the same interfaces and technologies since such a long time?? The answer would be android still sucks and iphone rules the market😙😙😙😙

fuck what did you do to 108 mega pixel it will never be a great and nice picture 12 megapixel get the nice and great picture!  i dont get why they put 108 mega pixel hahah lol! iphone 11 pro max still the best!

seen and touched the S20 Utra phone .....wondering about waiting for a few month to get same tech as US gets?

Marques Brownlee Chipset? in New Zealand no full-fat Snapdragon 865 that the US and other regions get? NZ gets Exynos chipsets  (slighterworse battery performance/ day running? What difference to consider?  64mp or 128 GB microSD?

Which phone do you like?

Bro for a person who travels a lot is this s20 ultra phone would be good in camera context i mean

I know you talked about camera etc an number don&#39;t matter but would you rather choose a 64hz or a 120 hz screen i mean big numbers don&#39;t matter lol

xiaomi poco f3 hold my beer.

It&#39;s a flop. Samsung&#39;s trying too hard

How much price

None

the phone you need to run elder scrolls blades smoothly in 2020

Samsung is in race with NASA. 😅

awesome!

You should make a 60/120 fps 1080p video so that we can experience the smoothness of that display xD

still waste

Still cheaper than iPhone 11 pro max, which costs approx 1500 USD for base 256GB variant here in India.

I hope these phones don’t blow up like the note 7s

Koreans so exorbitant. According..their economy

Does it still have heart rate sensor?

It&#39;s not a Smartphone, It&#39;s a Superphone

Give me plese

IPhone looks ugly I hate iPhone even in s20 ultra there will be lot of fun to get 100x zoom

Yes it&#39;s better camera than iPhone make camera comparison with iPhone it&#39;s better than iPhone camera, display and iPhone is nothing in front of s20 ultra

Now canon and Nikon should add a mobile features on their camera’s

Best smartphone ever
this phone is a beast and also it&#39;s price

when will pocket sizes catch up with smartphones?

price plz

Played with the 108mp at Best Buy today with a few of the sale people. Tested out the zoom on the phone. Pretty good up to 20x after that pictures started looking like trash. At 100x zoom the pictures looked like blurry blobs. Played with other features of phone for about an hour. Difference in cpu speed was negligible. Screen didn’t look any more vibrant then the note 10 plus next to it. 120hz was good but screen lost some punch cuz well 1080p. Not sure if there is a real need for 120hz as there isn’t much for content that uses it. It seems more like a spec war like who’s dick is bigger. Compared some photos between s20 ultra and iPhone 11 Pro Max and didn’t see much of a difference. Software is still same as note 10 plus. 16gb ram vs 12gb ram absolutely no difference.  Then looked at price tag and laughed hysterically. 2500.00!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂. Wow Samsung. You didn’t just move up a bit you took a running jump. Clearly isn’t worth it full price. Asked about financing and at 78 dollars a month this is ridiculous. Gonna wait to see what comes out from other companies this year. Cuz clearly I want to be able to afford a couple mortgage payments instead of marginal upgrade. This is my true unpaid review of the s20 ultra.

Not enough storage space

Eventually I understood. I will have to wait for the launch of Galaxy S 40 and then I can afford this one.

Finally I can buy s7 now.

“So this brings us to the most important part of the phone... the camera. “. Why do we even call it a phone anymore?? Hahahaha

I’m xs max user and bored, will take this s20 ultra 🤩

Apple: when did you come out with thisSamsung: whenApple: yuhSamsung: no when did I ask

One day we gonna make a phone which has a fan,a mixer,a cooler,a oven,and a....a...bathtub everything in it.

Hole punch wtf? It&#39;s 2020 bruh

So does this phone have the same restrictions for refresh rate as the non-ultra variants? You edited in a clip for them, but not sure if it applies to the phone with more ram

Need advice. I got a student discount so I can get the S20+ for around 800 Usd and the Ultra for 1050$. I don&#39;t really need the 100x zoom but I think it&#39;s a pretty good deal?

No more Bixby button?  SOLD!!!

#3 on trending

! They keep on adding more cameras (its going to look Iike an octopus one day), keep on making the screen bigger ( will be a Wacom tablet one day)... But they should; focus on screen durability so we can rock these cool cell designs without cases, they should develop a all in ONE camera, they should focus on making the batteries thinner but with larger capacities... You know... They should PUSH THE ENVELOPE and CREATE! Yet... They just add more cameras, usually use the same battery capacities, fragile materials... BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!

Future : full of cameras in the back with 5000 mega pixel camera

No thank you, Im gonna stick with my s9 lmao.

The most ridiculous specs I&#39;ve ever heard...

Huawei/Xiaomi : makes zoom phonesSamsung: makes zoom phonesthen apple comes and creates their own and calls it new and innovative
