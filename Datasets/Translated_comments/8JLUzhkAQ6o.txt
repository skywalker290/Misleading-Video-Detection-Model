Notice the NSX has its antena up going over the hill and then all of a sudden its down...Wish we could have seen it and the trans am later on

Why couldn’t he get early parole? That’s horrible. He didn’t kill anyone.

That Honda nsx 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Look at the buster... still grannyshifting.

I love how this scene plays tribute to the 3 Hondas from the first movie as all the cars are black just like the Hondas and they in formation similar to the first movie

Why are Tego and Leo even here, they never really did anything.

Then it went horrible wrong in the 5th movie, gave the 6th another chance. But damn, even some of the worst Winnie-the-Pooh movies were better in my opinion.Will never understand why people keep watching.

That &#39;wheeeeee&#39; melts me😭😭😭

Why dom smiled?

F&amp;F 4 has so many incredible scenes. One of the best F&amp;F movies and criminally underrated

<a href="">1:13</a> that gear shift for..🙂❤

We not gon mention how Brian shifted into 1st

imagine adam and belle&#39;s joy when they know that eric ariel lumiere and cogsworth are going to break them out off the prison bus

I love the look on Jordana Brewsters face as shes shifting gears

<a href="">0:50</a> love Mia hairstyle.very hot❤🎉
Fast And furious - Dominic &#39;s Prison juvenile Connectional FelicityBy Los Angeles sheriff Department

That gear shifting from Brain gives me goosebumps. It’s 2023, still can’t believe Paul is gone .. may his soul rest in peace ❤

DOMESTIC TORETTO COPS

FAST AND FURIOUS 2009 MOVIE

They&#39;ve been making a fast and furious movie every 2 years. And this is where it started. The franchise has gotten really annoying in recent years. To the point where I&#39;ve become a hater. If I had a time machine I would go back in time to this moment and tell Brian and Mia not to break Dom out of prison. Because as hard as it may be to watch him go off to jail, it&#39;s ultimately what&#39;s best for their family and everybody else. Trust me.

one of my top ending movie scene of all time with a perfect transition to credits

There the knights of the round templar

He only has 11 more years to serve. Dom about to be free!

I don’t know if anyone has noticed but in the credits the charger turns into a challenger

I&#39;m gonna cry
4

I always crack up when Tego Calderon &amp; Don Omar are arguing in Spanish.

Fuck that lmaoo

Honda NSX,I love you Angel 👌😌💞🔱
Honestly I think this was my favourite scene. Jordana and Paul did an amazing job and I loved it so much my face literally lit up as soon as I realised they were here to save dom ❤❤❤ forever love this movie

Nsx

didn&#39;t Dom said that he&#39;s NOT running anymore? Here his crew broke him out to be a wanted fugitive in Fast 5.

We all thought that dom could go to no prison😂

<a href="">0:15</a>

Epic

Jordana Brewster driving Is the Best of the movie... Even better than Gal My love Gadot

<a href="">1:04</a> I like how Brian looks at Mia. He’s proud of her.

Am I the only one that realised Brian took the licence plate from his Blue R34 in fast 4 and put it on the charger that he rebuilt for Dom

Dom knew what time it was when he heard his charger switching gears yesss sirrrr

Better cliffhanger than Fast X

Lompoc is not a maximum security prison lol. The inmates are allowed to roam outside the prison walls 😂

The only time Brian drove dom’s car

<a href="">01:13</a> I like Dom&#39;s smile. He recognized his monster engine and realized that it was Brian because of that granny shifting(shifting too early).

Only time Brian drove a V8 supercharger 😂

This is the most underrated F&amp;F movie and my fave. It was all about Dom, Brian, Mia and Letty. And still had several racing scenes. The recent movies have like 30 different characters and no real racing

seeing Brian drive Dom&#39;s charger just put a smile to your face.

NSX ❤
I’m here for nsx 😮
Even Best Movie Got a Great Ending Keeps Coming Back
Mia in the NSX 😍

Are we just going to forget Leo and Santos in the Trans-Am?

that NSX.......................... (and the woman driving it ofc)

Toño, are you trying to cheer me up? I found mota's video funny😊
The film which inspired me to drive a car

ok its all good but lets talk about the fact he switched to first at 60mph &lt;

<a href="">0:30</a>

So badass seeing brian drive the charger here!

ill never forgive them for ruining this franchise.

That judge screwed up horribly giving Dom the maximum sentence even when he willingly allowed himself to be arrested.  The system only validated Dom&#39;s belief to keep running and breaking the law.  Just an epically bad decision.

<a href="">0:49</a>-<a href="">0:51</a> her smile reminds me how much she has an awesome taste in cars

To be continued to Fast Five

After seeing the trailer for Fast X I can assume FX will have a similar movie ending like the 4th movie since FX is only Part 1 of the finale

1,⚰️
My top five FF movies7, 6, 5, 4, 3...may not necessarily follow that order of preference

<a href="">1:15</a>

for normal people driving a car is just that but for people like us who love to accelerate and feel the power of the engine is a dream...

Mia&#39;s NSX is sooooo fucking pretty 😩

Love this scene

Top fast and furious 4 I love it I'm all a fan
There&#39;s a not so big problem I&#39;ve been dealing with this film for years now and yet nobody answered, so here is my question, how did Dom&#39;s Charger got rebuild from being exploded to perfectly conditioned? I know it&#39;s just a movie but how?

Imagine them waving at him goodbye and just drive off

Brian went from being the ‘buster’ to brother in the movie

Single handledly the best 3 car line-up in FF history. Genuinely impossible to chose which one to actually own if you could only choose one.

The Buster got him out of handcuffs. Once again.

B : I almost had you... D : Had me?You never had me,, you never had your car 😁
<a href="">00:55</a> Do they ever stop arguing? :)))))

While watching this movie for the first time I thought that oh no ....it shouldn&#39;t end like this ...but when these cars came into the scene ......daaaamn 🔥🔥

First two movie: bestTokyo drift: nice try!This one: not bad!Fast five: okFurious 6: not badFurious 7: great ending thoFurious 8: ok just stop9: enough!10: XD

And surround yourself with people who know the dangers and don't allow anyone to come near the area. He also describes the nature of the field of giving understanding.
<a href="">14:11</a> He was also attacked by a criminal because of itchy eyes, dry eyes, blurry eyes, itchy eyelids. But it makes me feel guilty. If you blame the circuit, why don't you remove the circuit? Why do it?
fast five is the best of all time

As what bernie mac once said &quot;the driver don&#39;t pick the car the car pick the driver, it&#39;s a mythical bond between man and machine&quot; never won&#39;t forget those words

I dont want to cry, why am I always crying …..

DEV

But how did the bus tip over the bus was to strong and can destroy the whole car nose

I love that Charger, but that Trans Am though!!

i&#39;ve learned that Mia loves Hondas. She drove the Blue Integra in the first movie, there was an integra in the beginning of this movie and now she&#39;s in a NSX

name flim plese?
Brothers and sisters did not abandon in trouble......this is how it should always be...
"You shift gears like my grandma"
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38

Mia driving that NSX 😍😍😍

You have to watch From this scene to the last scene of 6th part. Rest after that is bull crap!!!

Dom Coras, don't feel so good for me, it's very important.
This should have been the Sopranos last scene.

Please do not take anything to heart from the evil that the &quot;criminal group&quot; posts. because if they had at least one &quot; gram of mind" ....no, and they would have chosen Neacșu Gabriel Garcea as leader of the criminal group who led them to hell....so that it hurts you right in &quot; the slip from the shoe &quot; .....

The Hemi Charger is a signature car for the from franchise.

I saw this when I was in elementary school and the car Mia was driving was so cool! That's what I thought, and now that I look back on it, I realize that it was made in Japan, and moreover, it was Honda's famous car, the NSX.
How is the film called
You are right to be angry….
The beach is hot af

Hearing that blower whistle and that big block pulling numbers up alongside the bus when Brian chops to 1st makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up like a hardon every time!

My old love

where the Charger came from ?

Funny to think how Tyrese was supposed to be in the third car that Tego and Leo were in, but he couldn&#39;t keep his mouth closed about being in the film.

Mia looks sooo bad ass driving the NSX ..

Two comments:<a href="">1:03</a> Who the hell is in the background?  All those cars were together.<a href="">1:13</a> Shifting in to first gear at ~75mph would cause the transmission and/or motor to explode if you even managed to get it in the gear in the first place.

Brian driving the charger is epic, but still dom didn&#39;t drove an r34

sooo um where was the chase?

Then the start of the next movie was them rescuing him

Again no Mercedes or BMW? No why, it just doesn't fit because they are commercial cars. The NSX alone is so cool.
You insulted your great-grandmother, transporting so many prisoners in just one bus.
Wow @ Mia driving the NSX …

How did this get us to flying fieros in space?

Now that&#39;s the way to have a brothers back

The most unrealistic part is having California plates on these cars. You can&#39;t even install a aftermarket exhaust in California, yet alone turbos and other stuff.

Out of all the fast and furious this one is probs my favourite. Especially the ending! Goosebumps every time!

Its fast 5 not 4

In reality Dom would have died it that fatal bus crash, and the next movie would start with his funeral.

When you see O&#39;connor driving American Muscle, you know someone must have really messed up bad, and they are about to pay 😬

😂

Dom &quot;The Buster!!&quot;

It's crazy to see Brian in Dom's car, he's like his nemesis.

who need prison when you got family

Modern trans am looks lit

To be fair, the court did not hold up their end of the deal. They promised to clear Dom’s name for bringing in Braga, and they just said “No, no I don’t think I will” and sent him to prison anyway.

These movies aren&#39;t good.

Silly ending. Not a fan of the films, but it was the only thing that was on TV that was watchable and for something in the background. It&#39;s laughable.

That nsx is hella good😍

&quot; You are a Long Way From Home &quot;  &quot; this is Brazil &quot;

He said he did 2 years at Lompoc in the first movie and he was going to die before he went back but he was pretty close to going back

Miss you Brayn soo much
how the hell did brian get dons charger back after dom hopped out of it in the tunnel

I wish I had reliable boys like him

Fun to see a bus I built in a movie. It&#39;s a now outdated bus, should see the current models of prison coaches. Absolute tanks.

Family...

This is the exact moment F&amp;F started to be a nonsense action movie

Right before this scene Dom tells a wounded Brian leaning by a car that he isn&#39;t running anymore.This scene: <b>*proceeds to escape anyway*</b>

The law maybe strong, but not as strong as family.

Did that little old school drum and bass track hit anyone else&#39;s souls?

Why did Brian downshift to 1st 🤣🤣

that nsx 8=======================D

Family is the strongest element

Good thing he’s always got family watching his back.

Omg the ending😂

Lompoc prison security is strong, but not as strong as family

That sweet NSX daaaaaaaaaaambn

That nsx doe…

Dom did get screwed as he risked his life to get Braga

FAMILY

Don&#39;t worry dom, u have a family

That damn NSX honda is unreak

There nothing strong than FAMILY.

I love American muscle but damn that NSX is sexy AF

For family

<b>People who are watching this comments, I wish their parents still Alive for more than 100 years, God bless u and u r family 💚💛💗</b>

Best Final Scene

This is a very good movie

No need for escorts. Criminals like el chapo don’t get transport on buses you know

How the hell did he get 25 years to life?

Good night congrats go amen good work
Fast 9 Dom can break the chains with his bare hands

The downshifting in the Charger, Dom knows Brian is coming to get him.

It was at this moment, Dom joined the avengers

At the time I think I was back and forth, either they were just riding off with him for the last time or they were about hijack the bus like they have been doing with trucks. Even in the hijacking, turned out like nothing logically expected(movie).

<a href="">0:47</a> Mia and her nsx is my favorite part

And this mechanic Dom beats trained military officer Hobbs and trained assassin Jakob

R.I.P P.W.

Good god that NSX is breathtakingly beautiful. And so is Jordana Brewster driving 😍

That smile when you know that you&#39;re not going to jail     🔥👌🏾🔥👌🏾👌🏾🔥

after the end of FF4: &#39;&#39;man I sure hope they show what ingenious method they use to break Dom out of that bus&#39;&#39;beginning of Fast 5: &#39;&#39;&#39;oh they literally just tip it over and crash it. I forgot the &#39;family&#39; is made of supermen at this point.

Mia looks so badass here.... 🤘

Yes, he pulled off heists but a life in prison for that?

It&#39;s good when Paul drives the V8

What’s the name of the Honda

curious after shooting this scene for fast 4, they they already begin shooting fast 5 after? Because of the opening scene of Fast 5

I love this scene because you really don’t get to see Mia driving

Brian must have been like, This is very uncomfortable

I was surprised seeing Brian drive the Charger then i realised ... who else could even drive that monster

25 to life for not killing anyone. Fuck?

<a href="">0:42</a> The NSX has a fat radio antennae <a href="">0:47</a> it’s gone

Can some1 plz explain how Brian got Dom’s charger back when it was literally blown to smithereens in the cartel tunnel ????

Mia is beautiful in this scence . Lover her😍😍. Always come to see her .

Word of advice boys: don&#39;t ever stop your 69-70 charger in front of a prison bus thinking it&#39;s gonna stop 😂.

The fact that we only got to see Paul Walker in a Charger for just that moment was something we had to treasure.

This was the last movie in the franchise where it was actually believable and no outlandish gravity defying stunts.

I always liked the arguing brothers

For rescuing Dom, fuck the entire men on the bus. Yeah, that&#39;s the family we are talking about.

Dom: Looks through the window and sees car plate:Front Plate: EMRGNCY (backs up car)Back Plate: EXTNOWDom: 😏

The best ending scene of the series

Soon as he heard that downshift he knew who it was, “the Buster brought me back”

Theres only two guys Dom is gonna EVER let drive that Trademark Dodge Charger, Brian, and Doms son

Yo can someone explain how Brian is driving that charger? I thought it blew up in the tunnel when Dom switched cars

Anyone else just realized the charger was an automatic?

Can someone please temme, What Tego and Don were talking ?

Bro the best car line up ever

that ws cool

It mades me happy to see Brian in the charger

The thing that always pissed me off was that Dom had just helped nail a drug lord to the wall and instead of being given immunity was being sent up to federal prison.

That NSX🔥

Jos

This might be the only time we see Mia actually driving fast (and furious). She has had a cool Integra in F1 and a sweet NSX in F4, but no other prominent cars that were &quot;hers&quot;

The comic comedy of the two spanish is awesome

Should have went to credits right at <a href="">0:41</a> to keep it suspenseful and have people excited for the next one

<a href="">0:46</a> 🤔🤔 They are similar to PlayStation games, and the truth is that the games are derived from the events of the movie or films.

This was baddass

Yea right you telling that to toretto🤣🤣

What's the movie like? 🤦‍♂️🚬 No Arab is willing to attend
Such a horrible franchise! What started out as an undercover cop infiltrating an underground street racers, turned out to be street racers taking down drug lords, solving crimes that the FBI or local authorities can&#39;t solve! Don&#39;t get me started on these cars being able to defy the laws of physics 🙄

Dom Da Dom Dom Doommmmm

Vvvvv
I must say....I had a crush on Mia(Jordana Brewster) when I was young haha

Love that Trans Am

Great scene, but who on earth takes an nsx to an prison escape

Legend has it they were trolling Dom. They ended up just driving past him and going to party on the beach.

dom hears the downshift and is like &quot;ahhhhhh okayyy😏&quot;

rip 😩 this shit hit home
I’d take the NSX anyday

I love brian driving the charger 💙

Does anyone find it funny how Dom is sentenced to 25 -life without the chance of early parole but yet at the end of each movie subsequently he is able to gain his freedom by helping the cops, or Hobbs I should say, with some big issue. What happened to no parole? 25-life? Now I&#39;m not complaining I am just curious. Does anyone get to earn their freedom from that high a sentence in one fell swoop?

This is fast five

Already at highway speed, Brian downshifts into 1st? Lol

That NSX in this scene doesnt get enough credit

Dominique's expression of "I'm done" is also nice.
very beautiful and wonderful

Jordana and Paul look great

Love this scene! ~October 2020

Anyone else notice that the nsx had a v8 in n it during the credits?

so cheesy
There's no way a bus full of prisoners would overturn like that and only one would escape... they were all dead...!...and a film...!
dislikes are baby mama people

Seeing brian in the charger feels so wrong yet so right

That charger must have a long ass first gear

Dope scenes

<a href="">0:44</a> that fuking sound &lt;3

HARD AS FIIZZZUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!!

Let’s transfer prisoners to maximum security prison and let’s have no police escort or no ushers.......let’s go through open deserted roads so that others can just come and grab the boys, just like that.An awesome way to deal with the scenario.

HI please happy

Back when fast movies were about cars..

Super Dom sir

Good job success movie new
Deadily duo in Hollywood history in domnic toretto and Brian o corner they r cool asfuck as hell 🤩🤜💪🏻🤛🤘👊

Can someone explain to me how someone sentenced to 30 years in prison in a maximum security prison leaves court for prison by bus and without an escort? 😂😂😂😂😂
&#39;no wonder why this movie video with 2 black lines on the screen top and bottom...no full screen ??

&#39;ha ha copy from the movie MAD MAX in australia

after hearing the sound of the sound of his charger he knew that his brother is here

its not an ending scene bro...and its no f&amp;f 4 its f&amp;f 5 first clip....Don&#39;t try to fool us.

God, I'll pick you up in a charger.
hey man you make great videos
Love nsx

Baby Draiver Nothing to Invide Fast and Furious
I love these NSXs. Japanese 90s cars are the best.

I&#39;m glad Brian and Mia recused Dom.

bruh the firebird trans though.

I wonder if the NSX is the heaviest car out of all of those. It was an insanely heavy for being a sports car.

Who knows what the movie is?
After this or maybe even fast 5, I&#39;d stop watching any of these movies. Went down hill after that

Which team can stop these people when they are unleashed

since we're going out with the buffet like this now with 10 and lotto we'll see how it goes
Trans am bitch! 💪
Wow, NSX the best

Lol what a bullshit. No police escort at all ?

Trash....you edit and post like you wear socks on your hands, so you have an excuse why you post trash and lies. You lying sock puppet.

Two places to leave your brain at the door.    A church or a movie theater showing a Fast and Furious movie.    One will want you to believe in flying horses and talking snakes.    The other wants you to believe you can parachute a 4,000 lb car into dense woods, land on all fours and casually drive away.    Both are equally ridiculous.

Movie car chases
Car : NSXBike : NSRI love it

This video gives me a goosebumps

First and last time when we see brian in a muscle

America is a country of lies

Im not a thirsty guy but if i saw a chick in a nsx i would be lol

What is the name of car mia is drinivg complete name plz

does anyone noticed, brian reduce gear from 4th? to 1st? In real world it should burn gearbox clutch etc

When Mia Brian and Others were Chasing the Bus Then Dom Thinks that that&#39;s My Families

When Dom was being transported to prison, I thought there was no more hope til I saw the three cool cars chasing after the bus then I knew Dom was gonna be rescued. True friends don&#39;t run away, they come help..

Shankar

those cars are masterpieces. damn.  the nsx is a legend in japan together with those american muscle legends. damn.

I’m amazed that we finally got to see a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am in the Fast and Furious universe 😭

<a href="">0:55</a> i love how they&#39;re always fighting lol

Is no one gonna talk about how he was going like 60+ and throws it in like 2ed gear 😂

The first time and the last time Brian driving a muscle car

<a href="">0:39</a>  me and the boys going to the car meet in gta 5

What if the bus had just stopped when they saw suspicious cars driving around them. And then just used their guns lol

I always thought they were just driving by to give Dom some hope because he wouldn&#39;t be able to hear the sound of fast cars for a long time.....

Hi

Don omar ft tego pontiac trans AM funny

Like for Fast&amp;Furious lover

So a 4,000 pound car stopping a 30,000 pound bus without moving? Seems accurate

Honestly this is where the franchise should have ended!

Rip:Paul Walker

Man there&#39;s not one comment on how dope Mia is looking in this scene after stayinf tired and bored throughout the entirety of the film

That smile was the beginning of the fuck up franchise

One of the best endings in this series, damn r.i.p Paul Walker 🙏🏾

that NSX :)

Hijacking this bus on it&#39;s way to Maximum security seems much easier than the DVD Player TRUCKS ROFL 😂

I wish that NSX had more screen time

The most badass, epic scene of jordana brewster. She looks so cute, hot, beautiful and cool as fck here.

This scene alone changed me from a F &amp; F fan to a DIE HARD F &amp; F fan!!!!!

I remember when I first seen this. I couldn’t believe what they were about to do!!!!

Don y this 😍
Notice how Brian took the charger to first gear and Dom is like &quot;that&#39;s my charger yeah&quot;

Pffft uh huh
I would be happy for yhis to be the end of the series.Go out with the gang busting dom out dont show the escape just end on doms smile as he realises.Not f5 f6 f7 etc end on this movie

Uo

how can you travel a bus with full of criminals without a single police escort? 🤔🤔

I'm going to go to jail, please, please, for Mother Naet and Aishfang.
Well done for posting
<a href="">0:50</a> When you realize Mia aint even wearing her seat belt

I can’t watch anything anymore without rage shadow legends popping up

But if someone gets killed or raped they only get maximum 10 years

i love car..

lol its fast and furious 5 not 4

I salute the coolness of the car.......
I am ashamed of Brian Dom and  Mia all 3 should definitely be in prison for life with no visitation rights or release they deserve it for the bullshit they all have done

I love it

Where are they taking their hair?

Of doms charger have been destroyed on the tunel how brain get him?

Can someone explain to me why, when and how torreto got arrested cuz i have not watched this movie and i probably still wont understand even if i do watch the movie

VERY NICE MUSIC

his guys are so cool
Fast five opening :D

I have all parts of fast n furios

Just listen to that engine at <a href="">00:45</a>, music to my ears, I do like this Charger but it&#39;s nothing compared to the one in the first film, and it was rare to see Brian driving a muscle car, besides this scene the only other muscle car he drove was the Camaro in the 2nd film, and three black cars, reminds me a lot of the truck hijackings in the first film

Can someone explain how Brian is driving Dom’s car? Dom’s car blew up in the border tunnel when he switched vehicles.  Or did nobody else notice that...?  And yet it’s still here, and in 5 when Dom says to Vince - Mia thinks it’s a curse.  Am I missing something?

The link to the movie is as follows 😘

I like it a lot
