The Best actorThe Best action heroOne of the best directorsHere comes baap of all in acting and action AJAY DEVGN

I remember little Singham

Ajay Sir my favorite actor in hindi

Kajal Agarwal don&#39;t know abcd of acting waste actressWhat an acting by Prakash Raj sir 🔥

I love you singham

Shabash Singham

I can recall my father complete watching this movie at 3:00 am at night.. He is an extreme introvert type of person and his favorite actor is Prakash Raj.. If this movie is played no one in our family is allowed to change the channel😂😂.. We know these dialogues by heart but still we have to see this film..  So many memories ❤

indian guys must be very lightweight... getting thrown around like balloons.

Magadheera music
आता माझी सटकली 🔥🔥🔥🔥 dialogue has a separate Fan base 💯💯🤣🤣Dialogue writers : Sajid-Farhad should write these one liners more instead of the Crap they write now
love you ajay devgan
