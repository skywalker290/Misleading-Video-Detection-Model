For all backgrounds to the true history of the spectacular escape, read the article here: <a href="">

Why is it partially public?
Eh, I cried so hard -- Iranians have been fighting for their freedom for years and more intensely over the last year --- I hope they too will become free like East Germany at some point.
Seems like even in 2022 we cant have freedom and independence.

Why is this unlisted?

Tiny old cars are just the beginning now they are used as escape cars and BMW your isetta is perfect that it will never be forgotten Believe in BMW isetta

This ad is sooooo good. It is more than just a simple advertising advertisement.
Great  video

Are you trying to copy concept of TATA NANO ü§îBye the way this addvertisement is too boring

It‚Äôs emotional from <a href="">2:38</a> to the end

The legacy continues

It took like 5-15 year just to get a car so more likely it would be the 70s and a better plan but he could also get shot they had parties search parties looking tell me if am wrong

And just 20 years earlier BMW was manufacturing vehicles for the Nazis. My how the times change.

@bmw seriously i have an isetta nur why Hey say over and over again that this Car is stupid i think for the time it was a good and afordable Car.. Sure the Trabant Had more place but the quality is on another Level.. my mean and i saw a Lot of Trabants and Sometimes an another isetta

Fucking Hitler&#39;s laudus.

This ads reminds me the ads from Mercedes Benz called : Bertha Benz The Journey That Changed Everything, but anyway both ads were great...

Don&#39;t mind me i&#39;m just here to see the comments from angry commies

Bmw rests in my heart ‚ù§

A very sad historic moment, shows us how clever smart people will always fight for it&#39;s freedom. Iseta, a landmark on our history.

East Germans in the 1960s: check BMW&#39;s engine cabinetNorth Koreans in the 2020s: check BMW&#39;s grille

Maybe it&#39;s a side effect of my Astrazeneca, but i crying sooooo much when, Germans make (witty) films/shorts about their dark past, not a specific one, they have had many.Especially if it&#39;s BMW to do it ... since it has had a big role in certain dark past. When there are faults, it&#39;s better to avoid certain arguments, the past cannot be changed, but at least hypocrisy would be avoided.

East Germany kept most of the population on a strict diet which made the escape possible, today you would need at least X5 or X7 to smuggle two average weight Europeans

First, the USSR fought against fascism, then it created it itself.
What&#39;s the girl name? She is beauty.

That driver did everything he could to look guilty and give away his cargo, yet the Isetta still came through.

All they do now is hop on a Dingy and sail to England, no problem.

Where is that Isetta nowadays?

Thank you very much
Excelent

The help of an BMW driven  by a man with balls bigger than an Isetta

FCK communism and socialism.

This is now called human trafficking

In 2021 billions of people still suffer from hemorrhoids by 

Oil consumption and chain stretching in BMW engines.

And not a word about who that brave man was...As if the BMW drove itself

The things people did just trying to cross the Berlin Wall is crazy you could probably write a book on the escape attempts that people have done with the wall up

Wow its perfect

Smol indeed..

Can we use the bmw isetta to free Palestine?

A MOVIE IS WORTH IT üëçüèΩ
Facts: the Isetta is not actually a BMW original. It was first made in Bresso Italy by Iso Autoveicoli from 1953 to 1956, the BMW Isetta is a licensed version made from 1955 to 1962. The car was projected by Ermenegildo Preti and the design was from Pierluigi Raggi. It was also licensed in south America and produced as the Romi Isetta, and in France as the VELAM Isetta. Yes, all of this is a research. Yes, all of this is a flex on the fact that we actually made the Isetta, and BMW simply limited to build it under license. Yes, all of you BMWeirdos that thought &quot;the BMW made the Isetta&quot; must kneel before the superior original Iso Isetta

Saved 9 people?) And killed thousands. Supplied the Nazi. Produced bmw air planes, millitary motorcycles, cars. Renault saved few thousand lives with minicabs

Plot twist the dude that escaped Germany  was a nazi

Moral of the story:Border Walls Don‚Äôt Work

WOW the only car company  ads that makes me cry. From now on I will only buy BMW products.

And where did he put the tank? And spare wheel, none?
<a href="">1:02</a> Budapest, Andr√°ssy str. (Kod√°ly Circle)..
Spectacular story but the Isetta is not really a German car since it was a collaboration between BMW and Iso (an italian car brand)

You must to know that the Isetta is not really German but also Italian it&#39;s a collaboration with BMW and Iso. Otherwise it&#39;s a spectacular story !

Wow that‚Äôs just phenomenal !!! Unbelievable

Yes,but for all peoples of World,and without governs and without armies!No Masters,no servants,but only free persons.(A)

how dare BMW be anti communist.

Great message kids, now fight to stop the spread of globalism, and international communism from china. The whole reason innocent people had to cram themselves into the body of an Isetta is because of their desire to escape the insanity caused by the communist takeover of half their city as it spread across Eastern Europe like a cancer. The same harsh, inhumane beliefs and ideology that caused open escapees to be shot by the guards on the wall is the same thing currently eating away at our society right now. Also unlike back then, it doesn&#39;t matter whose trunk you hide in... there&#39;s little to nowhere left to run to. Communism and Socialism must be purged. Hell it should be illegal.

haha ... I know DDR germans who have the opposite vision of those historical situation ))

German engineering at it‚Äôs finest
Yeah, and tens of millions more died because someone thought they were better than everyone else. Caring ppts.
I clicked on this link because only today I was thinking the Isetta would make a great retro electric city car

Freedoms that are now under siege again by agenda 2030 and covid vacins...

THEN WHY CANT BRING THIS CAR BACK AND THIS TIME IT CANT BE PLASTIC LIKE ALL WAYS!!!!! IT CAN BE HYBRID CAR AND ELECTRIC CAR AND HYROGEN CAR THE GERMANS WILL LIKE THAT IDEA AND OTHE COUNTRIES!!! ITS A GOOD MARKET IDEA!

This is pretty good ad

The sequel to Papers Please is looking good lol

Nowadays BMW&#39;s grilles are larger than a issetta .

Bravooo
Cool video. I would like to see more stories about how BMW&#39;s technology has affected people&#39;s lives. For example, how planes with BMW engines bombed civilians or how &quot;valiant&quot; soldiers of the Third Reich rode motorcycles of this company.

In a word, CRANBERRY))
Well done, they dismantled the USSR, but all the Americans and allies had to do was abandon the occupation of Germany, which is what the USSR wanted, and hand over the reins of government to the Germans
Just say no to Socialism.

You guys should really consider relaunching the Isetta, Citro√´n has the AMI, Aixam is getting decent figures (where I live, I don&#39;t know in other places) and now Messerschmitt is back with their KR202. Microcars in general should make a comeback, they have a lot of potential, specially nowdays with cities becoming more crowded and cars becoming bigger, microcars could offer a small, cheap and easy to maneouver and park option for people without too much to carry. I really think you should try, and since you also make motorbikes, you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble finding an engine for it, specially if you use your boxer engines and, well, an EV option should be aviable as well, I mean, at this point such thing has become mandatory but nonetheless, both options should be aviable, it would be a waste abandoning the ICE with all of it&#39;s remaining potential, also, speaking of potential, you might want to check on a new rotary engine called liquid piston engine, not only for this hipothetical Isetta but for small motorbikes, I found a video where a 2.04 Kg single rotor engine produced 4 hp at 10k rpm, could be a real gold nugget with propper company investment.Also, speaking of investments, I&#39;d like to thank you for putting those 12.5 Mill into Prometheus Fuels and their carboneutral fuels, as a car enthusiast, and I think I speak for about 95% of the car and bike comunities, that really meant a lot for me and millions of ofther enthusiasts, thank you dearly.

This is nonsense, they escaped from the USSR on a top-secret plane.
But there is no video where people were transported on a single-seater motorcycle.
BMW know the ture value

Pure class.. no matter how old u r .. BMWe love it

Illegally occupied enclave of forcefully divided Germany is called &#39;freedom&#39; while Germany is still under occupation.Glory to DDR!Extra laugh for typical cliche propagandistic dark gamma when depicting DDR.

Germany should have remained partitioned

Germany sucks

You gave me goosebumps, amazing ad from BMW as always.

Actually invented and built by an old Italian cars factory called ISO, the name was &quot;ISO ISETTA&quot; and produced under license by BMW from 1955 to 1962.This is history.

Checkpoint Charlie

I wonder why BMW released this, especially since its new cars are very ugly and soulless
cool, but isetta was sold under license. it&#39;s not a bmw

<a href="">2:14</a> is when my mom found my zero point test

Those who dislike the video are the guards

Now that‚Äôs an advert!

Where is the BMW story?

Oil leak.

BMW, a very good film, you guys are great, I wish there were more such historical mini films. Escape from the GDR at that time was not very easy
DO NOT FORGET THAT ALL THIS HAPPENED BY THE GARBAGE OF COMMUNISM ... AND REMEMBER THAT THE SMALL DOOR TO COMMUNISM IS THE PROGRESSIVE SOCIALISM OF TODAY, THE COOL GUEVARISM OF THE PROGRESS THAT IS DOING SO MUCH HARM IN THE USA, EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA. DO NOT LET THE COMINISM OF CHINA, CUBA, VENEZUELA OR RUSSIA ENTER YOUR COUNTRY OR YOUR LIVES. LEARN FROM THE PAST. FORBIDDEN TO FORGET.

VW makes an ad like this:

yes big dick
<b>D E U T C H E   Q U A L I T A T</b>

The Isetta was not invented by BMW but comes from the ISO works in Italy.  Since BMW was in crisis, they took over the Isetta under license.

Thank you so much BMW for this video for showing what really possible is that people can get freedom from escaping from a car especially Isetta üòÉ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç. And keep on showing some incredible stories like this in future üòâ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Damn good job BMW!

BMW for ever üíôüíôüíô
looks like there is a traitor in our socialist state

BMW Forced labour from concentration camps, produced fighting sidecar motorcycles BMW R75 and aircraft engines.

From the zhezh scoundrels, they did not allow men from Germany to the GDR to visit girls! Or vice versa..?
We were lucky, the oil didn‚Äôt leak, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have been saved
The best car commercial I had ever seen.

Will they also make a film about emigrants ? What has Germany become ?

The wall was a mistake, let everyone who wanted to escape, the GDR would still be alive.
This is freedom?

&quot;If there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way&quot;  - Chicken on the run film

This video  means what

Do bmw still use slave labor?

That&#39;s why BMW is a Gangster üöóüòÉ

Is this apetor?

Anything is better than communism.
Now thats how you do a commercial...

Imagine someone in that hidden box sneezing or coughing when the soldiers inspect the car.&quot;DEAD&quot;!!!

Here&#39;s another reason to appreciate the legacy that comes from these companies that have stood by overtime. I wonder how many people owning such beautiful machines understand the history behind the brand.

Frau merkel floods germany with totalitarianist muslims.Freedom sweats in the corner nervously.

How many people were left out of work after the wall was destroyed?

<a href="">3:26</a> What‚Äôs it saying?

Wow

<a href="">2:03</a>Does anyone know what the music in the background is called?

What about nazis?

Cringe
I was stationed in West Berlin in the early ‚Äò80s and always love hearing about these stories how people escaped from the east to the west.

Another brand, if not Mercedes, is BMW ... haha

They earned their living from Hitler and the war

How did the DGR government not realize they were in the wrong by the fact nobody risked their life to flee into East Berlin?

Back then the GDR, today the Corona dictatorship is no different, even worse üòâToday people have to meet in secret because the government cares so much about our health üëåüòÇBMW after 30 years you can also make a short film about today's dictatorship üòâ
Remember, Sisters, never buy a BMW, not because I don't like someone, but for the sake of historical justice, so that they don't have to "suffer" again. in the GDR, they obviously don't know why, you, Justyna, already know very well what is due to whom and you know what justice is, you know what they did at Szucha, would you sentence an SS man to the gallows, yes or no? He would also suffer in the inhumane Polish People's Republic.
weird flex

I am a BMW owner watching this video in Budapest, Orbanistan. can anyone tell me why do I feel uncomfortable at <a href="">3:37</a>?

Fact, the current leader of Germany, Merkel never went against the communists in East Germany. She still refuses to release all East German Government files publicly and to charge those responsible for the torture and death of innocent people by the East German authorities.

The BMW Isetta was a cute small car and my father had one. I hope that in near future the microlino is ready to buy.

This is the most unique BMW ever built

that car can fit a lot of clowns in that car.

A pretty brave commercial all in all

I want to see &quot;based on a real story&quot; about BMW R-12 or about Dornier motors ... I think this is the greater part of your story =)

I believe this is the trailer. So where&#39;s the movie? This looks like a good movie.

What can we learn from this video is use BMW to escape.

Aka cold war

Please humans, don&#39;t bring that time back. Live with freedom and bring peace to all generations.

I think BMW its best company in Hollywood ,not in cars ;) how is the dirictor......

I was so touched by the video..

it&#39;s a real shame that there now is control everywhere over the internet.

That&#39;s it&#39;s such amazing story. Bmw made story to freedom. Lets play this movie nazi camp workers ,wich work for BMW in 2 war. Thats happend long time ago? Shure i can find somthing fresh. Lets play this movie in China. Big company like Apple or BMW gets profit for invigilation human. Maybe we shuld find few bmw isseta and give this people for free. For freedom. Give like to more range.

and in ww2 bmw was a motor for the nazi war machine

BMW member the old days when u wore producing for the Nazi war effort with airplanes and motorcycle parts using Nazi slave labor !!

Bavarian Motor Works
Many of the scenes were filmed in Budapest (Kod√°ly k√∂r√∂nd). You made more than a 100 billion EUR in 2019 and you were shooting a really Germany and within that Berlin centric video. Really shameful for you that you couldn&#39;t pay a little more to rather rent out a street in Berlin or at least a street in a town anywhere in Germany.

Traitors of their own nation.

Very good video. Also i wonder how the men fit in and out.

Lets be honest, those officer uniform is still sharp and badass, it is been kept ever since the founding of german confederation or german empire, considerably, my most favourite kinds of uniform

Capitalist propaganda.
BMW is my favourite car

I love this brand

I&#39;ve ridden an Isetta at a local car meet once but it was so tiny that it&#39;s incredible to find room for such a lot of passengers lol

BMW made aircraft engines too.

the silliest thing is that today BMW is part of ne dictatorship in europe and they didn&#39;t even see !!

Haha i got this car in forza horizon 4 and tuned it, i love it!

The German people have suffered a lot, I want them never to suffer more. I wish peace üëç

Most German thing I&#39;ve ever seen

Can you made a film, about BMW engines in german strikeaircrafts and motorcycles 1939-1945 ?

When German engineering is so good thst the video is un HD

Pls i need ost
i clicked for the isetta wasn&#39;t disappointed

Smol isseta

And there&#39;s still people who want to tell you Communism is a great thing and should be tried again. If it&#39;s so great, why do so many people risk their lives to flee such countries?

it is crazy how small things is big for other,especially those people

Should they (BMW) bring back BMW Isetta with new EV

Based BMW

I think it took years just to move and turn on the car

There is a name for what they didHuman trafficking

Fuck you, these same freedom-wishers bombed cities, burned entire villages along with their inhabitants, and then complain about why they were treated this way. Do you think everyone has forgotten about this? No, it's me!
You deserved Germany for your crimes
Not just a car companyA changer and a legacy

Wasn‚Äôt the isetta designed by an Italian fridge/motorbike company but was later sold to bmw?

I PERSONALLY FELL THOSE GUARDS ARE SEARCHING FOR A SPACE TO GET IN

The clip felt like a complete movie.... A flawless and a very realistic one! Great job BMW!

Very beautiful film, thank you.

Did you know that Isetta is one of the most powerful BMW`s ever? You may think it is impossible but hear me out for just a few minutes. So this is more than just a commercial. Inspired by true events it brings us closer to important history of this part of the world but it also shows the history of BMW. And the way it shows it! Legendary car that saved not only human destinies depicted in the video but also the BMW itself. And that is not all. Actually this is where it just begins. Isetta shows the spirit of BMW, it`s will to survive. Yes, it is a small, actually micro car, it doesn`t have that BMW grill, hundreds of horses under the skin, it doesn¬¥t drift, it won¬¥t have that angry face in you rear view mirror but it looks kind and saves. It saved a company, it saved those who escaped from behind the wall and, toady, it saves our emotions. It makes us grateful for those BMW leaders who had a vision, courage and will to fight for BMW. Who knows would we have a new 8 series or M5 CS, X series, or iX and others today without that little car.So, little Isetta has only one cylinder but millions of hearts behind it. That makes it one of the most powerfull BMW`s ever!

Really want to buy one, when grow upüòÅüòÅ

remember when you made tanks..

I can thoroughly recommend the ‚ÄúCheckpoint Charlie‚Äù Museum in Berlin when the virus allows us travel and freedom. It‚Äôs an inspiration to those that struggled in so many ways to find the freedom in the West.

Wow. I love BMW!

I had a right hand drive Isetta in the very late 60s and loved it. I often wish that I still had it.

Nice story

Speaking of escapeThe grills of the new generation BMW&#39;s is the same size as those vents where people escape prison in movies

Was is a big deal to stay in your own country?

touching.

Bmw be like ayyyyteeeee
Very cool, now we have Corona and everything our parents took to the streets for is being trampled on by the government.
Impressive video. I always liked the Isetta because it is so quirky. My BMW dealer has miniature versions of it placed near the coffee machine and everytime I look at them they make me smile. I never knew this little car had so much more to it. Respect for the Isetta in many ways.

Nobody is born of course, but except...

Not to get into politics but having my own family suffered from red ideology..I just wish the millennial Marxist would ever ask themselves if the communism is such a great system why every communist government shuts the borders for their own citizens?They wouldn&#39;t because typically communist supporters have poor ability for logical thinking.

This makes me want a BMW Isetta.

try fitting guys in a peel p50

Imagine how easy would had been with a honda civic

You should make a isetta 2 gen

The isetta is a small car but it doesn&#39;t look as small because the cars back then were small too

why there are so many dislikes

Introduce a new Compact SUV

Well actually the Isetta was an italian car but at the end it was sold to BMW so it isn&#39;t german engennering that made that car but italian

Saw the YouTube gallery. This is how you make a commercial, it's not by putting boring and unbearable videos interrupting my videos. While you (YouTube) irritate the consumer with your invasive advertisements, smart companies like the one that made the BMW commercial make the consumer want to watch the commercial.

It is really amazing!! to watch a BMW involves in a freedom movement... just not mentioning what they have done in nazi era... really amazing...

Is this still the same company who made aircrafts and motorcycles during ww2 using slave labour.

just bought a brand new m3 2019car is a rocket

Nice, now how about a series on how BMW is helping free Chinese dissidents :p

Pretty ballsy of BMW to make a video like this tbh

Hi BMW! I really need help. My dealer in Russia stole my darkened mirror. And he doesn&#39;t want to give it back to me. The service gave me the usual one. Support for BMW Russia does not want to solve this issue. Please find out the truth. I can send you the vehicle&#39;s VIN code to check the configuration.

i wonder how many could you smuggle with the new X7? i mean you could fit a family of four in the grille alone lol

I saw Clarkson driving that thing inside a British territory

One of those guys look like Vasily Ignatenko but older to be honest

and yet there are people who think communism is the answer for everything... morons

In 1964 bmw save the live of 9 people with an Italian car, but 20 years before... They kill millions of people with German engineering

the Isetta is a very cute and tiny car, it looks almost like a motorcycle like those produced by BMW during war times using forced labour from Dachau concentration camp, huh.

I saw this Isetta in the museum in 1989, while I was stationed in Germany till I retired in 1990. It was very pleasing to see the East German Trabant driving in West Germany before I left! I was an 11 year old &#39;Army Brat&#39; living in German when the wall started going up in 1961. I was a 39 year old adult when it came down.

BTW BMW independence also means independence from the EU and NATO and other organizations.P.S. although I myself am from the Eastern Bloc and see this as &quot;Western propaganda&quot; I have to say that you did a very good job with this video or short film. Thank you also that the GDR border guards are not ‚Äúassholes‚Äù. but were portrayed more or less like any other normal person, and were even very polite!

It shows what BMW stands for. That were the toughest of the times.

This story is heartwarming

It might not be the best car, or the &quot;quorkiest&quot; car out there. Even for its time, i belive that there were some other cars that were particularly better for the job. But that ad right there shares a part of the story in the east berlin. I am not German, I do not  live in Berlin and I don&#39;t even live in Germany. I don&#39;t have anyone lives in there or had lived there in the times where it was west and east Berlin. But, I understand that it was hard. It was chaotic for the people of the same nation and even the same city, knowing that there is something better out there and not that far away but you are stuck with what you have. And authorities shame you for not being grateful. Belive me I didn&#39;t live in the time, or didn&#39;t experienced the &quot;exact&quot; same thing. But I understand what it was, and I respect those people that used an Isetta to make people free.I know this comment has nothing to do with the car but knowing that it has a history like that, I just can&#39;t hate that car or make fun of it. I respect it and I respect BMW for owning that history instead of discriminanting it

i LOVE bmw!

she: Do you want to come to me?
Me: Sorry, I can't. I'm in East Berlin
She: I'm home alone
I:

Bmw should start making real movies about their cars

Nations divided by politics and ideologies one day unite....but nations divided by religion in never unite. Example India and  Pakistan.It is a huge learning for mankind how Germany rebuilt herself.

This is the most German thing I have seen

So no matter the clip.
My biggest respect for the hero there&#39;s bring germans to germans!This movie has a good transported vibe, sure!But I am shame for BMW to wear the jacket on the peoples historys back, like Mercedes-Benz in his Museum in Stuttgart weared with a german-german timelapse of history and tell a story like it&#39;s Mercedes&#39; hers.Maybe BMW tells in the future the history about EMW (red-white label) and BMW (blue-white label) in similar enthusiasm? That would be a story where BMW was actually involved.

when Australians want to travel further than 5km from their house

9 people found freedom thanks to hiding from the communists in the trunk of a BMW in 1964... Check how many Jews found hiding from the fucking SS men in Polish basements and how many people died because of it... Whoever is married doesn't laugh in the circus... knows history...

It would have been historically accurate if the cars engine overheated and broke down on the way out.

You just sell your car to the place where has no freedom and independence!

i have been to a car collectors house once and he had a purple isetta. and i have also been to  a collection building called the Midwest Dream Car collection in the Little Apple. it has Lamborghinis, Ferraris and my favorite, the isetta that has the body made entirely out of wine corks

east berlin was much better than west.

Love this car and I love this brand!! Come check out our experience at the BMW Ultimate Driving Experience this year. It was amazing!!

Can&#39;t wait for BMW to make another history-inspired video. That one time they used forced labor from concentration camps to produce aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe would be a great topic.

Don‚Äôt forget guys, BMW also helped build the Nazi war machine (planes, then bikes and automobiles)

they should show this to all this socialists dick wads in ever college and schools to show them how grate socialism is ,

And now we have Merkel &amp; Co.K.G. On neck...
Dear Germany forgive us for tearing you apart

In Weil der Stadt in 1964, in the camp, as it used to be called for emigrants and refugees, now asylum seekers, there were two BMW Isettas where we were abandoned and we refugee children then played in them! Now I know why, we fled with them to the west! Thanks to the BMW!

Great, you believe in independence, can you give Mini and Rolls Royce independence on developing their vehicles now?

BMW car quality surprisingly sucks !The BMW dealer (stevens creek) is selling you defective car with brand new price !!!I purchased a brand new 2020 X7 from this dealer.And the car was broken after 7 days driving:1. The touch screen is 100% off, I can not control anything on the display.2. The bluetooth wipe out my and my wife&#39;s phone (Andriod and Iphone both) connection 3 time a week, which mean we need to reconnect/reconfigure our phone connection every other day.3. The battery is dead permanently, the error signal was on when I purchased it originally, but the sales told me it will be back to normal after couple days driving. But after 1 week driving, the battery error signal is still there, and need to be replaced.4. The rubber seal on the frontend hook is coming out, and looks really ugly and do not match the BMW brand at all.5. The auto lock is not function at all. After enabling this feature, the auto lock still not working at all. This feature is very normal one on any premium brand car back to 5+ year ago.  I personally own another Acura and Tesla, all of cars have this function and there is no problems to use such function in the past 3 years.6. All of the cellphone app remote control function is not working on my car. I can not lock/unlock/flash/horn the car via the phone app.I drop off the car 5 calendar days (4 business) ago.And service department is still working on it, from the time it took, I can definitely tell this is not a small issue. Since the service adviser told me, replacing a new battery will only cost them half business day.So for sure, there is a huge defective on this brand new X7 car.I am really surprised that this dealer will sell defective car to the customer, especially on such high end/premium 7 series product line.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update @2020-06-24:After 5 days waiting, today afternoon the service department just called me back, saying the display is totally off, and can not be fixed by them. So they decided to order a new display from BMW, and the new part will arrive on Friday(so another 3 business days waiting). And then they will need to replace the display part completely!Can you imagine this is what happened to a brand NEW X7, with 7 days driving and only less than 200 mileage.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------update @2020-07-16After 3 weeks of review, the BMW North America customer relationship department called me and said they made a decision and will do nothing regarding my defective X7. I feel speechless and helpless. BMW is acting like a robber, who steals your $, with a defective product, and does nothing about the complaint. I do not see how BMW is caring about its customer. Really disappointment, and I will seek to sue BMW North America.

Great Advert

The car is too small

Lots of east germans escaping to the west, but no west germans escaping to the east, and there are still fools who support communism.

I find it audacious for a company like BMW to make such an advert, given that BMW became the powerhouse it is today by supplying the Nazis with arms during WWII and profiting from the forced labour back then.This advert is in bad taste.

So the Germans helped Germans to escape from Germany into Germany with a German car while getting searched by Germans.Seems legit

It's kind of funny that BMW advertises with such a small car even though their new cars are clogging up the streets today with their gigantic dimensions. It would be nice if BMW could go back to its old virtues. This millennium nothing has come onto the road worthy of a BMW.

If all the add were made lime this it would be a pleasure to watch.

Why don't you make a video of the Nazis driving a BMW into a Belarusian village and burning it along with the inhabitants.
An isetta like this is buried on a farm near Imr in the village... it would certainly be interesting to dig it up
Fucking soviets
the car is so small u need a magnifying glass to see it

a mercedes wouldve take 9 at a time no problem lol

I heard the Stasi were even more zealous than the KGB. One of the first ads on youtube, that I not only liked, but loved.

why don&#39;t they boast about greater achievements?

for example, thousands of successful three-passenger military motorcycles and many thousands of engines for fighters and bombers during World War II?

How cute is this? Commercial, based on history is always interesting to watch. May be next one would be about employees from Dachau?

This only makes BMW even more legendary

Can you shead some light on some BMW products from a few years earlier lets just say 1936-45 somewhere in that time period

It would by cool to see a modern version of the isetta

I would ho back and forth back and forth get people and bring them back i would not stop until I get caught

Bmw is a man
didn&#39;t bmw make vehicles for the nazis?

Anyone here?..2020?..anyone?

Bring Back the Isetta !

1200 Dislike from Soldiers

Lemme guess.....Recommended?
USSR : THAT&#39;S ILLEGAL...!!!!

WHO MADE THE SCORING FOR THIS AD?!!!AMAZING!

Since the Peel P50 is street legal in the US, ya‚Äôll should make a Isetta 2020

East-------------------------West

The people look like SS guards but thats probably me (ik this is set during the Berlin wall and things)

M√ºnich Edres Pavlike Pavlike...
What is the real pronounciation? Bee Em DoubleV as in English or Bay Emm Way as in German?

VIVA ITALIAN GENIUS.
What I thought of, is that the smuggled person must obviously only come out once the destination in West Berlin has been reached. That is, as opposed to as soon as they&#39;ve crossed the border. Otherwise, then the East German guards can see that, know that someone escaped, and know for next time.

Saw the Isetta two years ago in a museum in  Frankfurt. I just stood there and watched the car for 15 minutes straight. There was just something about it which made me feel... weird.

The isetta was scrapped and his students continued the operation with the same idea but different isetta smuggled a total of 9 after they got caught. While on the other hand not in the video a volkswagen beetle 1200 was also used smuggled a total of 55 people across the border.

I went to a human right museum in southern Germany and I seen the car model. The owner explains me that the car is the same BMW car that helped people cross from east Germany to west Germany in order to achieve freedom

BMW 1964 ‚Äî cool for spysBMW 2020 ‚Äî gay

one of the BETTER ads..as well as one the makes since.

East Berlin Propaanda
Uff incredible scenes ... Really adorable story. Insane part of BMW üöó... Hands-off

I saw that car at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. The fuel tank was relocated. Amazing. 1964 also being when I was born. My mother also had an Isetta, a white one.

BMW should do an all electrical remake of the Isetta for city purpose.

Communism are disease

I love BMW s1000RR

Russians will be back.

<b>sm0l*</b>

I&#39;m not supposed to allow to post this, but let me tell you something.Extreme exploitation capitalism and communism combined together, that&#39;s an endless nightmare.

Well, as usual. In the GDR they killed everyone, took away all their property, in short, stupid scoops, everything is clear.
Haylimin's brand is BMW I love you
One of the best BMW ads. Willingly watched till end stops

escaping to capitalism. nobody escapes to comunism.

East Germany is chill

The BMW  Isetta is today&#39;s Uber cars lol

Something new.....

1964 - Berlin is a divided city. 1989 - Fall of the Berlin Wall unites Germany. 2020 - Berlin is a divided city among natives and immigrants, rich and poor, far left and right wing.

But where was he hidin?

Capitalism, happiness, fuck you. BMW, well, we are scum.
Really a little big Car!

new moto : BMW , HELPED SMUGGLE PEOPLE SINCE 1993

Yeah you are right...9 germans survived from germans and some years before killed millions...

So BMW is advertising in which they show the inhumane role of a communist regime and how well a BMW product has helped oppressed people achieve freedom. How good that one of BMW's largest production sites is located in the exemplary democratic and human rights-accepting state of the People's Republic of China. You can always rely on German companies that did the best business in the Third Reich! Even if one or the other had to jump to the sword because he wasn't an Aryan and was therefore forced to help BMW with production until he died in a similar way to the opposition in Chinese prisons today. nice advertising!!! üëç
I made a LEGO model of the BMW Isetta. See video on my channel.

Can someone please post a translation of this?
They doing a commercial with they&#39;s car that rescued few people after the second WorldWar but they didn&#39;t say that they have build a war machines for III Reich... Who&#39;s beeen killed milions of people, that&#39;s commercial schould have never been relesed for popularity for this company.

They do better sales advertising than they do our films. Take me to your factoryüò≠I am a good turner with an education in design and architectureüò≠

Brainwashing and deceiving people again. Where is Hawking? He is the leader in all things on earth for generations,,,??.
In Tebessa Algeria hundreds of people still helping their families financially using Mercedes benz 250 and 300 1980-1994 to  smuggle gasoline and other products..

üîÑAll jokes are funny, but damm history.

Germans escaping from Germany to Germany from German shepherds and Germans using a German vehicle.

Press on the tears.... Just don‚Äôt forget that with your direct participation, almost the entire industry of the GDR was destroyed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. People from eastern Germany are still second class citizens.
Amazing story.
Meanwhile chevy with their &quot;real people&quot; ads

So touching!!!
I think they should bring a new isetta to the market

I hate how they say &quot;9 people found freedom with the help of the BMW issetta&quot; like BMW where freedom fighters or some shit back then  even tho just a few years before this they where making aircraft engines for Hitler

Imagine two of this coincidentally show up at the same stop at the same time

No doubt, the best one can get at slump time. A saviour..bubble üöó

the worlds smallest bmw.

that is a galaxy brain move right there, hiding people in an Isetta to sneak them over the border!

Beautiful!
This commercial is good but I have to say, BMW didnt bring those people across the border. BMW also used slave labour and supplied nazis in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. The sentiment is touching, but never forget the past.

Take him to Palestine, so water and food pass from Zionist-occupied Palestine. Take him to Palestine, so water and food pass from Zionist-occupied Palestine.

Most bravery and emotional ‚Äúclown car‚Äù ever.

It&#39;s definitely not about the car or thing that was used to escape, but about heroism and sacrifice of people who risked their lives in escaping to freedom.  What could BMW say about the infamous past of its brand during World War 2 in Nazi Germany?Greetings from Poland.

Back then BMW cars were not overpriced and disposable pits of money.

Let&#39;s not create another communist dystopia ever again.

I have a car which is similar

escape from german to german sweet video to try to sell crapy car bmw your are dead anyway poor car poor company made in mexico

I forgot who made the engines for me 262 again

I defend the socialism and the ddr system I just don&#39;t defend the Soviet intervention and demand of closing the border and making a wall the past acts of the world isn&#39;t fault of the ideolagys its fault of the ones that lead them to the wrong way and destroy them

didnt bmw made tank engine and rocket engine for nazis ww2

Escape using IsettaThis is your daily dose of Recommendation

2020 bmw isetta is basically gonna be a smart car but even worse

And this folks, is why any BMW fanatic must have an Isetta in their collection.

Those guards must‚Äôve been very upsetta

We all going to die

Where I can buy this car in North Korea please?

this is the original &quot;i guide others to a treasure i cannot posess&quot;

BMW safe someone life. I feel touched üò≠

The Isetta is a beautiful car, I never knew it had secrets underneath.

BMW settled down
BMW, human trafficking made easy.

i love how the bmw isetta design, i hope bmw made the reborn one, cute but modern with so many technology and front door

Imagine getting pulled over:Police: <b>step away from the box</b>

ENDLESS MONEY PITSorry

This must be a fake BMW, I don&#39;t see it tailgating anyone or cutting anyone off with their brights on.

The sad thing is that modern Germany unfortunately forgets that communism (today partly the view of left-wing radicals) is just as much a part of its own history as National Socialism. 12 years of school in Bavaria, almost 8 years of which were taught history and the GDR for over 3 weeks in the final year themed.. The rest? Ah exactly NS..And then you wonder why the German youth thinks everything on the right is ‚Äúevil‚Äù. and everything on the left is great..
wtf they demonizing DDR?

What can I say&quot;I set ta car&quot;

Who&#39;s here from YTK?

This is great at the time when u can put a man help him escape to West Berlin safe the issetta is the best

Dislikers are Audi fans with tiktok accounts...

At that time Mercedes build 300sl,not a small baby cars

Old models of bmw‚Äôs were much more cool than the new models. And the logo was better too. I mean i like also 2017 bmw but not the electrics

Thank God this is not like that shitty gay add mercadies put out bc here they actually talk about a car

This is about Klaus-G√ºnter Jacobi, the car is nothing without that man.

I know this car from Forza Horizon

Yes smol escape.
<a href="">1:25</a> wait isn¬¥t that actor Vasil from Chernobyl?

Can someone tell me the reason to dislike this?

My father&#39;s uncle had an Isetta! It&#39;s such a remarkable little vehicle!

You were trying to cross the border right, walked right into that &#39;Soviet&#39; ambush, same as us and that German over there.

Why don&#39;t they make a new isetta

Long live sacred GERMANY ! üòÅüçª
BMW This was Good I mean Like BMW at the Time on the east Might Have been like Sad They could not go To the west to work

BMW has always been good at creating ads that people actually watch.

Tbh BMW should make a more modern issetta that resembles the original really well but still modern

take me too, I&#39;m still in a totalitarian country

I have 2 stroke ddr wartburg üòä

Memories of my childhood, 1960s. Many of these cars on the streets of Buenos Aires- Argentina- thank you!

The BMW Isetta is suitable for Indonesia, where there is currently a corona pandemic, and if you want to go home you will even think you are going home.
A Car so cute
proud to own a BMW 320d

Touring will never be so exciting again.

Just wow! &lt;3

If we are talking BMW history let&#39;s not forget The role of BMW during world war II, and the history of the Quant family...

If bmw still made cars like that I‚Äôd love them much more

This car on Forza fully modded is crazy

so are you releasing a new isetta or not

What a good story üôÇüëç

Coming up next, how many jews can fit into an Isetta?

GERMAN SIENCE IS THE BEST IN ZA WARADO!!!!!!!!!

This bad boy can fit so much loops

Autocorrect messed up the title it is The bubble escape.

Smol karr flees from Germany to Germany

Now do the same to china

What they want you to think: I want to get a bmw now. | What you actually think: They want me to get a bmw.

Ah yes the Cold War is no more  THE BMW HAS STOPPED THE COMMUNISTS

The quote of Isetta would be : ‚ÄúA little car with big history‚Äù

He berlin wall
Thanks BMW

Now, let&#39;s talk about BMW &#39;s contribution during the WW2.

This is my favorite BMW commercial ever. Worked on it for ten years. I can't believe that the most touching thing was an advertisement.
Communism is the very definition of failure!

A BMW ISETTA?

BMW in 1964: we&#39;ll give people freedomAlso BMW in 1940s: let&#39;s built Flugzeugturbinenfabrik and¬†Raketenabteilung for¬†experimental weapon

From Kidney grill to lebron james grill!

My friend who has a motorcycle shop has a red isetta in the back I like to sit in. He also has a broken helicopter hanging from the ceiling that ain&#39;t his.

Brilliant re-enactment by all actors, crew, directors and producers.

Wow!  A television commercial that doesn&#39;t shout through the TV set, well done BMW.

We can also use this in the village..the brand is the same BecakRedColorHa ha ha..NgarepReally......
I proud of this moment

All Hale the isetta

This was the time when bmw built cars to last. Nowdays they just won&#39;t last. :(

My father and I have been on and off restoring a 1958 Isetta for about a decade now, it‚Äôs all finally coming together and it‚Äôs awesome to see videos like this which keep us motivated to finish the project.

What a very interesting story I would of never known about this until I watched this video.

The perfect add taking in consideration that during war they used to make planes that killed a lot of poeple, details....

Ohh that&#39;s cute. Why you did&#39;t tell the world how many peopel lost life because of you?  Why you did&#39;t tell with who you cooperate in 1939???

I used to have a 3 wheeled BMW Isetta - and as a bet managed to get 5 people in it and drive 100 yards ! No border crossings involved though.

Wow

Communism kills. Hurrah for Democracy and Freedom!

Heartwarming story.... Thank you BMW

I like that one escape story where this east german bus driver welded some steel plates and went full on through the gates.

Danger! A spy in Berlin. Go, go, move on

I&#39;ve been to that museum with the car in Berlin. Also had home made microlights

Whoaaa, Nice one

The best car advertising!
Freedom and independence for everyone Except Hong Kong

The Germans are again strumming the nostalgic notes of the GDR/DDR. It doesn‚Äôt matter, no matter what you say, it was better before, the grass was greener, the sky was bluer.
I thought the video was gonna be about a police chase of a BMW Isetta :P

What were they escaping? Communism, Socialism. Ironic, isn‚Äôt it. Guess I should buy one of these cars, just in case...

World‚Äôs fastest bean
The funny thing about today, is that every time I run into a person who lived the first fifty years or so of their lives under communism, they all tell me how much they miss it, and how better it was back then, be it Russians, Moldovan, Georgians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, or even Kazakhs.

Everyone gansta until BMW isetta comes
How about role BMW in 30s?

ILoved this short masterpiece!

sometimes a car can be Hero

Stop producing this crap petrol cars you are responsible for fires in Australia or hurricanes in the US! Change you are so boring and yesterday thinking no innovation! Do it like Tesla it is environmental friendly and so much more fun to drive.

And once again, Russians are being pitted as evil.

This is one of if not the most heart warming stories ever who agrees?

Why did they run away to the other side ? isn&#39;t socialism a good thing ? xD

bmw used nazi slave labour &amp; the irony here........

I have brought my 2015 335i to the Hilton Head SC BMW dealership with manager Mike and service person Brad, and Columbia SC BMW dealership with Daniel and his manager, at least 4 or 5 times while my implied/written manufactures warranty still had year left since the first time due to door rattles that‚Äôs annoyingly unsafe and distracting specially while on the highway. These issues were supposed to be fixed but they came back every time or no change at all. So I brought my car again to Hilton Head BMW to get the rattles looked at for the 4th or 5th time for the same rattle issues along other BMW cosmetics that was already breaking in a car with 36k miles and of course my ‚Äúcosmetics warranty‚Äù ran out, that same day I was given a BMW mechanic ride along  with 30 years (but not while under warranty of course) of experience and tells me and my dad that these issues are extremely common and that this and that would have to be replaced, that since my car is out of warranty and that we would have to pay out of our pocket and they‚Äôd be happy to take our money and actually replace the parts. Meanwhile Hilton Head BMW only put ‚Äúfelt‚Äù that was placed between the rattling pieces this whole time I‚Äôve brought it under warranty at least 5 times to both dealers ,but as soon as it runs out we can switch the whole door if we‚Äôd like to pay. Everything made sense when Mike, a manager from Hilton Head BMW told me and my parents in his office, referencing that BMW does repairs based on how much warranty you have left, basically, telling me that they‚Äôve only done minimal efforts to fix the problem under the implied manufactures warranty that still had a year left since the first time I brought my car to get checked.Had another incident with BMW Columbia in which my car was steering to one side, brought it over at least one in HHI to check the steering and at least twice in Columbia. After countless of excuses that it was the road conditions, I finally was able to get a manager to drive along with me. The whole ride while I was driving he insisted that it was the roads, he even suggested that I needed to drive fast to drive straight and that I drive ‚Äútoo conservative‚Äú, as if he really believed that I‚Äôm really driving that slow, being a 22 year old car enthusiast owning a 335i msport, a mustang beforehand and many of friends sport cars.I told him to drive back and take his hands and knees of the steering wheel as he was preventing the car from steering right, out hen I said to take his hands from the steering wheel for 2 seconds, FINALLY he agrees with ‚Äúok‚Äù after coming for the steering issue at least three times.and while replacing my passenger leather seat because the stitches were already coming undone (36k miles!) they broke the seats side panel as it completely broke off exposing the wiring. I also didn‚Äôt notice for about three weeks after my seat was replaced because I don‚Äôt sit there. I sent a picture to my Columbia BMW service person and he never got back to me, and I also told him the rattles we‚Äôre back, no response. When I brought it to HHI I was already out of warranty, but clearly they had broken the piece as you have to remove it to install the seat! What a coincidence! $65 dollar part was given to me but I still had to pay $120 for labor! BMW broke it!! The FTC has a whole list of regulations to protect the consumer from sneaky practices like Hilton Head and Columbia BMW, I‚Äôd like to suggest specially one of their managers, Mike from Hilton Head should read over these regulations. The warranty has to last and actually fix the issue as it is written and you shouldn‚Äôt be given less consumer rights because there is only one year of warranty left instead of four.‚ÄúIf problems arise that are not covered by the written warranty, you should investigate the protection given by your implied warranty. Implied warranty coverage can last as long as four years, although the length of the coverage varies from state to state. A lawyer or a state consumer protection office can provide more information about implied warranty‚Äù@BMW

Kind of reminds me of how BMW used slave labour in ww2 and enabled the nazis to build war machines which destroyed 90% of Europe. Fuck you BMW shut up and make cars.
