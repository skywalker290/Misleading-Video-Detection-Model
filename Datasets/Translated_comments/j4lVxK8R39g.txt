These were/ are not BLM protests 🪧. These were/are BLM RIOTS!

Seriously you couldn&#39;t just flinged a few more bullets into this low life?

I live in Whittier Rest In Peace Boyer

Wat this video says is fake

That was my uncle please comint

It&#39;s nice to see some nice comments about LEO&#39;s even thou there are some losers  talking trash about LEO&#39;s should die, I say one thing that before I see a wife become a widow or a family destroyed over a senseless killing as this  I rather see you riddled with bullets until you can&#39;t be recognized if we didn&#39;t have these brave men and women putting their lives in harms way where would we be.

I wish more cops would die like this, kill em all

Way to go California letting killers out on probation! Dumb fucks

That black lives matter was a real winner huh! Not!😏

So I instead of letting out a drug dealer or thief, they let a murderer out, bravo! You guys or the judge who released him should get an award for dumbass decision of the year! 😁😏

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! dead ass fucking cops !! best thing iv heard all day man this cop must of done some fuck up shit for karma to fucking take his sorry ass out like that ! thank you god for taking out this criminal ass cop ! man you see god works in mysterious ways you never know when a miracle will come ! hopefully he will bless us with more of these miracles because im sick and tired of hearing about criminal ass cops shooting handcuff faced down people in the back of the head because they felt threatened ! really you feel your life is threatened by a man face down handcuffed!!?? bullshit ! god place kill more cops asap!

Most of the states that Tomo news have shown about these criminals are GUN CONTROL STATES WTF? Tomo New?

blm is a joke. no, i didnt cap blm, its not important enough

I don&#39;t understand why you have to kill the cops I thought black lives matter was to stop violence against blacks when they are killings cops for no reason

Notice how all the cop killers are minorities. The white cop killers are not part of the plot!

RIP GOD PROTECT THEM ALL

This happened just a few blocks to where I myself protect a banking institution. Most of the peace officers at Whittier PD would wave at me when they drive by. Great department and officers. It saddens me when a veteran officer had his last end of watch especially when considering retirement.

The first one happened in my city only a mile away from my house. So sad

How dare you support Black Lives Matter

R.I.P heroes and some peoples should stay in jail

California is a piece of shit

Rip

I don&#39;t expect him survive.

he&#39;s doing football numbers

The cops family should sue the state for the new laws. This guy should not have been out on the street but was because bleeding heart liberals decided this guy deserved a &quot;second chance&quot;. His &quot;second chance&quot; cost this officer his life. This proof that the liberal government of California is putting officers and law abiding citizens lives in jeopardy.

sounds like justice to me

I blame the State of California for releasing these pieces of trash early. And as such the Cops family should file a lawsuit against the state for letting out these predators and causing an unsafe environment for taxpayers and innocent people who try to do the right thing daily

{[R.I.P]} The officers that lost there lives [God bless them]

yes they finally do a story in Whittier

If only mental health is free in the USA people can get the help they need

Deport him

Blood again on obamas hands

All cop killers should be hung in public.

eye for an eye

It&#39;s these kind of news that no one will listen to until you hear cops firing... and I leave out Back cuz most people will stop listening after the word Firing.

shout out to my Latin brothers black and brown pride

that &quot;activice&quot; is an idiot

should have shot dead the gang member for murder. why is he not dead. aim for the head....!!!!!!

First 1000 people who like will get sweets and chocolate today and tomorrow!
