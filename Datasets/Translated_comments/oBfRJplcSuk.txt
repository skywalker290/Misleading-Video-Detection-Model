She is his actual gf 😅

Yoon kapaate tere lips hain


A lot of things are said and heard from there.


Sirhane hath hai, koi to baat hai



Patience is on the wane




This wall is shining with light


Mehak is staying with you, this body is yours


Kuch aisa khaas hai, koi to baat hai



I am still worried




Vaise to tere dil se judaa hoon



I am fond of the hair on my forehead


I am afraid of man's thoughts


I want to live in my own way




Bas my, bas my, bas mine


You are the one who is in my heart


In the dark, in the dark


Nai rehna apne apne





How did your whole mood change?


Your attitude has deteriorated.


The entry of my house


Why did you meet me at the back door?


Why are you in such a hurry?




Tip tip tip is a bundle of rain


make noise waste electricity


Gum ho gayi kyun-o-havasein


I am still worried




Vaise to tere dil se judaa hoon



I am fond of the hair on my forehead


I am afraid of man's thoughts


I want to live in my own way




Bas my, bas my, bas mine


You are the one who is in my heart


In the dark, in the dark


I want to live within myself, in my own way.




Bas my, bas my, bas mine


I don't want to live in that base


Don't tell me anything in my heart


That you are bad, that you are bad chenp


Hussan di pari tu jadoo wali chadi


Professor Snape is angry at me




Alag vichitra si, Vinci ke chitra si


The wings fell like Bond's mystery did.


I am talking to you baby you said baby


Take me to a party lorry in a bailgadi



No one ever said tricks


It is said that we get the fruits of patience.




Par just tell me



What is wrong, what is right


Cause, I know this angel is my baby girl



Sungh ke bata doon



That's what keeps my heart moving


Pal pal gadbad


Can you feel the dhak dhak?



Tell tell bloody hell what the hell?



I want to live in my own way




Bas my, bas my, bas mine


You are not in my heart


In the dark, in the dark


I have to live within myself, in my own way x (3)
