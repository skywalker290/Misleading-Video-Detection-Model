I was right in the middle of it. Russian bullshit. Shariy will confirm.
wow wow! I’m embarrassed to ask, but how can you distinguish a strike against ISIS from a strike against Al-Qaeda? What is the difference between a strike on the armed opposition and a strike on civilians? Or can only a certified reindeer herder understand this?)))
Russian actions can be rated 5 for courage (former coward), but everything else is questionable. Where the target is obvious, there are no hits. On YouTube you can find a video where, for example, the Saudis get caught in a moving pickup truck in similar conditions and there is no doubt there. It is not clear why suddenly weapons from the Chechen war (which the Chechens stopped) should be better in the Syrian one.
We need to write a petition to the Moscow Region to get the ODAB-9000 removed
What is this, night photography? Why is everything in such a terrible color?

Ministry of Defense! turn on monetization, you will have money for additional goodies and buy a normal camera! )))

Why is there a sudden change of frame during the explosion?! I'm sick of it.
and where is the sign “fortified area of ​​terrorists”?
Handsome guys!

Tired little animals are sleeping...
Somehow no one is running around downstairs asking to go to the bar.

Someone put the sound of a predator on the video_)
When I read the description of the video, I thought that it was in the UKRAINE, it turned out that it was in the UKREregion)). Not bad in both cases))
Well done, but why don’t you sign the results, we don’t understand whether this video was successful or not.
