It&#39;s Feb 2024...let&#39;s see how many legend still listening this masterpiece?❤

At that time,  I was a student of college, and always used to listen to this song. When I went back to my home. ❤ Golden era of hindi music after 90.

I didn’t give any flash drive to anyone. Especially people like Harry or Togashi. It's a lie
Satan
If Putin is dead, who is still hanging around in the Russian Federation?
A nit
It's a lie to burn in the scarlet
It’s as if He had already killed me. Got rid of
Why does Putin lie?
Philip, why are you slandering me? It was Diana and Putin who handed over my flash drives and broke one. While I was at work. They came in and took what they needed. So why are you lying that I gave it away. Where I am. Philip. I can sue you for violation of private property and libel
I already made it clear. I&#39;m this kind of person. I have better things to do than getting involve in a love triangle, square or whatever shape. It is not wise for my age to be in a love triangle. If given a choice, I would prefer to walk away and donate the person to the other. For me, it is not about who I love. But, who loves me.

I am manifesting my real life Aditya ❤
I think i always be here 😁 ....if someone is searching for me can find me here 😂😁

i also wantbe geet in somebodys life...yar

Who is here after kareena and Shahid eye contact 😜

He come my life i believe 5.manifest ❤
My holl life,Lost my love ageing and   ageing broke my harte 😢😢😢

Why go time, plz stop time,, if i have that possible, so i rounded,back time, 20 year&#39;s, because not enough for me😢😢😢

Na hai yeh pana

No place is there
That's her Jane
Why is this happening?


It's a great day with you
Surmaiye evening aati
Tumse hi tumse hi


Har ghari saans hain hai
life is called
Tumse hi tumse hi


Na hai yeh pana

No place is there
That's her Jane
Why is this happening?


Aankhon mein aankhon teri
I have you in my arms
What's going on in my mind?
in the back of the body
Raatein saugatein teri
Why did all this happen?
what happened


I don't know where to go
I met you when I met you.
Tumse hi tumse hi


There is silence in the noise
a little faint
Tum se hi tum se hi


Aadha sa wada ever
never more than half
Jee chahe karlu is trah wafa ka

Never get fucked
Tode na tute kabhi

The thread that made you judge of death


Mein Tera Sarmaya Hoon
Whatever I found in it
Tumse hi tumse hi
paths meet
the destination has been met
Tumse hi tumse hi


Na hai yeh pana

No place is there
That's her Jane
Why is this happening? Thank me later 😊
2023 oct present!❤

Not everyone can understands the purest form of love.❤️Every day has a moment when I miss her. Do you know? I love this pain 😌 very much because it is the only way I can feel her presence. 💝Nothing is mine, except for her memories that we created.I will love her until my last breath.

Life was so awesome before , we used to listen this songs on 9x channel while getting ready for school , we never thought that we will missed this moment , sometime i realized why we grown up so fast but the thing is nothing is permanent in this world, life is like a river it keep going never look back , todays smartphone generation will never understand how we used to enjoy little things when we had nothing , sorry for such long message                          --Boy from old generation❤

Todays generation will never understand why this movie is a masterpeace🥺❤
