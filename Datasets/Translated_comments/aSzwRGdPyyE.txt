Did you stay until the end?

Thank goodness for fast forwarding, completely useless

No way I would have fed ex or any shipping service handle the shipment of a 50 million dollar phone it could get broke from bull hooks they use to grab boxes they can&#39;t reach up high and puncture box drop it or steal it

Proud Indian 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
That&#39;s a one damn gold spinner. It deserves more respect then that Gold iphone

A guy like you? With a phone like this? Willy doooo

Looks like crap. Seems tacky and cheap looking in all honesty. $350 next year at a garage sale

Proud to be an indian

i&#39;m surprised how nobody talks about how lame that font embedded in the phone was

Love from india 🇮🇳

Inception.

Girls: I want to see the phone!Boys: Ooh yes, keeps spinning!

Bruuuh ..i was soo high watching this it was the best thing ever😂

<a href="">3:43</a> ...... thats for everyone here on comment section ... the moment of truth

Unbox,therepy,ception

I can&#39;t be the only one that was very disappointed when it was just an iPhone box when he opened the amazing Indian box.

The box is more impressive than the phone.

Ith nmde Amada petti alle🤔🤔
U r in some else&#39;s dream. Wake up. That totem didn&#39;t fell

great

Millionaires : I want a Golden iPhone Max pro.Billionaires : I just need a good phone which will last 4-5 years.

I like how he added another guy because he is kind of annoying by himself you know? Like he just kind of talks to himself

<a href="">3:40</a> Hi

why other guy every timen with the macbook

Damn this is basically the same look as the iPhone 12 pro ( gold ) lol

I just watched a spinning top spin for 2 minutes straight.

2021?!

That seemed like a dream in dream , inception topple

That top was amazing.

apple is really making me hate this channel now.

This is dumb

Pelo chino kon che
Time I&#39;ll never get back
So they put an iPhone in a jewelry box.🧐

Looks like a Mongolian treasure

Nostalgia. Inception 😄
I&#39;m from India and we have 3 of them in our house, but we stopped the tradition of keeping iphones in them from 1977

We can buy this only for unboxing

Seeing such a beautiful piece of art from my country INDIA go abroad while the wealth of our nation keeps going down breaks my heart.

all that build up just for an expensive CALCULATOR

U can literally put anything in the box for it to make sense except a phone

Wait there was a phone I came to see the top😂

Should have ended it like Leo&#39;s top in inception. Still spinning so you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s a dream or reality. (Because that price tag? Buys you a house in a third world country -- I would know, cause I live in one)

I feel sleepy

The spinning top is mighty

I came here for the name of the video, it starts with a FedEx box. Bro that isnt fancy

<i>incetion intensifies</i>
I would prefer if it was a high end gaming phone

This should be called “How to extend a Video”

Do you like Indian food?Please reply

Shit when shitty 24k iPhones in a big ass fancy box from India is the same price as a non 24k gold fold 2

If it comes in a cardboard  box instead of being hand delivered by Queen Elizabeth then it’s not the fanciest.

The good old times when iphones had chargers in the box

The best quality thing there Is that spinning top

Inception

Now I understood why Nolan chose to end the movie before the totem stopped spinning that left the viewers intrigued about the inception’s end 😂🤣

The spinner never stopped he’s dreaming! Give him the kick !

That spinner though. new world record!!!

where is iPhone 12? you are the biggest review channel in YouTube

the case was made in the 1950&#39;s in india what do you mean &quot;is it hand painted&quot;

Yep have one of those boxes...

So that&#39;s why I saw it in my grandmother&#39;s house

Indian style baby

THE TOTUM DIDN&#39;T STOP SPINNING...HE&#39;S IN A DREAM!

Proud to be an Indian

Box is more interesting than that phone🤭🤭🤭😉😉
So it&#39;s just gold spinner and iPhone, fancy box and a bunch of papers, all for $3,000. Geez.

that top is haunting me

<a href="">02:00</a> music name

An iPhone 11 Pro in a 19th century luxury boxWhat a waste

<a href="">3:52</a> - <a href="">5:46</a>thank me later
Adipoli

To be honest with you, I like the actual Indian made box more than the phone.

<a href="">3:51</a> dont expect something new after this moment

Missed opportunity to cut before the top fell lol

Imagine buying this phone and its gets stolen

What are you gonna do with these many gold plated things 😂😂😂

This is just an inception parody

woww thats for rich people.

Tries to make it 5 minutes by spinning gold plated top

I loved Inception

Me : .........my bank acc : dont ever think bout it.

They say that thing is still moving.

It was all a dream. (I used to read word up magazine)

This phone does not deserve a box like this. Stay with the cardboard one.

<a href="">1:48</a>  from the movie inception 😂😂😂😂😂

Dumb

Proud to be indian

I am from India

i can&#39;t believe i watched a top spin on a screen for more than 2 minutes straight

Is there anywhere I can get one of them boxes

We have old box like this at home its called Aamadapetti

&quot;You&#39;re not good enough for this&quot;

<a href="">1:51</a> Crash Landing on You drama backsound

The Spinner made the mockery of the iPhone.

Iam an indian

legend says if you keep looking at the spinner till the end you&#39;ll be in the 30th Century

I LIKE THE MUSIC WHEN HE SPUN THE TOP <a href="">3:52</a>

One of the gift of the three wise men

It looks like a gift for an Arab king

Literally the freaking spinner takes half of the video

I’m indian
Just sitting here watching a spinning top

Bruh I needed this 15 years ago when I still owned beyblades. That thing spun forever XD

Love from India💖💖💖
Lol it&#39;s Davinci not DiCaprio

A Indianthing

How heavy is it :”yes”

2 adults staring at a spinner has never been so amusing

they should’ve put customized 24k gold airpods inside the box

R.I.P. 6 precious minutes of my life...

Okay, so it&#39;s a iPhone in a fancy box. Started to question why

he reminds me of the guy from dude perfect

<a href="">1:47</a> is this an Inception reference?

as far as &quot;gold plating&quot; phones goes, I really appreciate their consistency lmaoimagine paying 2000 bucks for a custom phone and getting the vanilla ass charger

So You bought fidget spinner

When you have nothing to say but you have to finish the video

I am lost for word&#39;s right now 😁

I don&#39;t know what magic you used. But Yes!, I watch it till the end.

India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Do u get to keep items on the show?

I think they forgot to breath while watching the spinner, even the other guy got his teeth dry

Someone saw inception

When my teacher asked me for my homework it’s ya

What a great ending 😂😂😂😂😂😂

That was awesome!

Lol

I am from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
India iam from bro

The music took me on some Buddha journey....

way too noisy for unboxing

It&#39;s the journey, not the destination

They should put an golden earpods too.

Someone robbed my house after looking at the spiner until end

Arrogant piece of shit

After this video...iPhone&#39;s value in our heart becomes zero...〒_〒︶︿︶(✖﹏✖)凸(-<i><del>)凸凸(</del></i><del>)凸凸(</del>_-)凸╭∩╮╭∩╮╭∩╮╭∩╮╭∩╮
Did I just waste my 2 mins watching the spinner? 😅

🇮🇳I Love India❤️🙏
I WANT THAT SPIN TOP! LOL I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED WATCHING YOU WATCH IT SPIN SO MUCH! LOL

India is all about design bro....

<a href="">1:19</a> that&#39;s revolting , never been more disappointed in my entire life

But here in Philippines receiving something like that was just a dream

This.

I hope that I received something like tjs

I physically felt the suspense (ps watch till the end)

The box is used in Kerala to be exact

I’m too high for this

At least you weren&#39;t dreaming

Without the music the video wouldn&#39;t be complete😭😭

Due to u sir we watch rarest of rare electronic

Wait isn’t apples boxes the most expensive

<b>how heavy is it?</b><b>yaaaaaaa</b>

It&#39;s so prevalent in India that every family especially in kerala owns a box like this to safeguard ornaments and jewellery

Idk why i saw that thing spinning until i fall asleep

5000$ to me  until the end

D

Yay. We are indian

<a href="">0:00</a> my box never comes like that are u vip to them

<b>WOW... That spinner is awesome</b>Literary better than the phone

Such a missed opportunity. Surely end the video inception style!

<a href="">3:52</a> Top spinning intensity

Human priorities before 2020.

Wtf😂😂😂😂

And then the cable get ripped...the power brick you left at your ex house and you put the phone in a case for protection and that a 2100$ phone who went straight to hell

Looks terrible. Also gold is not as hard as metal

I want the box. Can i have it?

casing cost 200$ in China.

12 hour loop?
It is the traditional jewelry box in Kerala. Noble family store the jewelry in there, sometimes used to pass family jewelry on and on. Malayalikal like adi 😜

jewelry box
who got the inception vibe?

fuck the iphone...the box and the spinner is more interesting than that...

Biggest waste of money lmao

You better have kept the phone

Thank you so much for that spinning little scene that was amazing lol as well as the video was

he just wasted my 2mins!!

Why are companies trying to pass off their product as if they&#39;re giving you a shroud of God&#39;s cloth. It&#39;s always fun to unbox things but you don&#39;t need to make it extravagant to make it cool or fun.

Big flex on android users am I right

Buy a casket and return a pearl
the box literally costs more than my life.

Not impressed but so stupid

I am from India

From india

Gaining extra 2min watch time  by letting your audience look at a spinner? C’mon unbox Therapy, you’re better than this! 😐

hey guys, what grade should i buy an amazing fantazy 15 for 38.500 usd ?

<b>it&#39;s ya</b>
I feel like you could do a good podcast

Hey your vids are very good and planned good too. Keep an eye out for this phone...PROJECT ARA

I like box not phone

Just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning

Lame mod

What this video is about, 10% unboxing, 90% watching a top spin

unboxing a spinner

When the spinner is worth than the iphone review...😂😂😂

Why did i just watch a damn top spinning for 2 minutes..

That is nettor jewelry  box

They plated the parts that get worn the most, with the softest metal. This will look like shit in like 6 months. idiots.

trash ass iPhone needs a spin top to sell ha

I want it!  ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
All of east Indian company thief are unboxing and like this

Anyone get coming to America vibes when he said &quot;what is that velvet!?&quot; Lml

Indians put like here

Bout 1 ish minutes of phone stuff and the rest is just instrumental music and inception reference lmao

The Totem from Inception! I love that movie! :)

kinda itches my brain when you put the screen of the phone up-side-down.. LOL

Will is like the father on Christmas and lew is like the child😂😂👀

not 19th centuary, since BC ,

Fuck iPhone... Jackless system...

How many of you took a deep breath when the spinner came to end😄

Well that’s one way to make a video longer...

Love the spinning top reference to the movie &quot;INCEPTION&quot;

The box is lovely but when the iPhone was in, can&#39;t finish just no

It&#39;s a Kerala traditional jewellery box.. 😇

I wanna it
Mad as shit 😂

You’re so boring
He is a man of focus...commitment..and sheer will

Their is a reason they call it an infinity spinner... <a href="">3:52</a>

I&#39;m from Kerala India 🇮🇳 and I&#39;ve got that same box in my grandparents house.That box is called &#39;AABARANA PETTI&#39; means gold storage box .

Will adds really well to the show

Any body Indians watching this?

This is a serious question. Why the fuck is there a spinning top in that box? I just.... I just don’t understand. 🤨

Eww gold plated im more of a solid gold guy

God you have the best job in the world

<a href="">1:41</a> he give something at his finger😂

*Came here from the Steve Jobs customized iPhone video*: So that&#39;s where the Unbox Therapy iPhone came from.

He should&#39;ve just kept staring at it even thought it stopped spinning lol

how heavy is it?uh yeah!

The charging cable is not gold prehaps alimunium because gold doesn&#39;t conduct electricity But thats how phone get carged the end conduct electricity the midle caries to the end to the phone

Who are watching from india like👍👍👍👍👍👍
they spend 5 minutes just looking at the spinner.

Damn that golden top has an amazing specs, Interesting

I can&#39;t even afford iphone 7 or 6, wait no i can&#39;t afford apple products.

Wow, Its an iPhone 😱

THAT BOX IS MADE IN INDIA,KERALA

And i feel broke now
Tank you for such an ending 🙏😂

&quot;how heavy is it?&quot;&quot;Y-yuh&quot;

I laughed so much watching the thing spin. That soundtrack tho got my heart racing in suspense.

I was really hoping that he wasn’t going to skip the spinning part while I was watching 😂

That is a pretty half ass&#39;d product. WOW, two microns of gold and a fancy box.

What a cruel joke. &quot;GOLD PLATED iPHONE&quot; with only the sides which are gold plated. Fucking lol.

Was that a dream? 😵💯

Click the Like button below if you dident skip the top till the end. Don&#39;t lie...😾😑Its from <a href="">3:52</a> to <a href="">5:50</a> just to be clear

Me trying to get to 10 minutes <a href="">5:22</a>

I just recognised the box immediately as my great  great grandmother had one like that

even I thought I was in Inception 😅

where are the golden airpods ??? 🤬

I watched that top the whole way 😂

I was so happy an amazed when saw the royal box and waited what cool and amazing phone and stuff...may be in there....then I saw a simple iPhone box 😑...like...REALLY!!??.. ....it ruined the unboxing..

What a waste. On an iPhone? Really?

Who are Indian 🇮🇳🇮🇳 proud feeling
That was intense

This phone should be kept safely in a treasure box rather than in my pocket.

How long even was that spinning for

It is Indian. I am indian.

i was high watching this, had a great time

The look 👀 over at :37 is life 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I am jealous of u guys🤯🤯
the top could have exploded into some mystic code by indiana jones by the end

Does there shop send the box and the top when you purchase an iPhone or watch ?

Who tf is jack

Most expensive fake iPhone

<a href="">1:50</a> : the theme tune used for Grandpa&#39;s kitchen funeral :(

I was hoping it would just spin forever

That phone is ugly

<a href="">5:33</a> Ah Finally....😒

First time laughing at a top spinning. 😂 Well done!

The music is soo...

Does anybody know what the music is when he started spinning the thing?

like iphone 11 pro isn&#39;t expensive enough

what do you will all this stuff you get!!! dump in a garage :p

I like how these companies send him these boxes but when you actually buy the device they don&#39;t give you that jewellery box

does anyone know the piece at <a href="">1:56</a>

This channel has become a joke frankly I’m disappointed. Escobar phone and now this

superb gamin pc

Indians are great and I am proud to be an Indian

IPhone clone &gt;:(

May i know where u buy this thing???

You just bought the iPhone 11 and putted In the box

That was...unexpectedly intense.

It&#39;s okay would have been better if it wasn&#39;t an iPhone

Nice! especially the last 2 mins.

was i the only one who heard him say &quot;it&#39;s cryptic.&quot; but sounded like crip di**?!?!?!

How much haking mobiles

Excellent bro
I am Indian
Damn that spinner

It should be &quot;The fanciest Iphone 11 Pro unboxing experience&quot;, not smartphone?

Imagine everyone who saw this Subscribed to My Channel. I wouldn’t know how to react 😭

Its like unboxing the Ark of the Covenant :P

<a href="">1:34</a> – me in an Auschwitz holocaust museum
At the end, looks so intense, spinner more attractive than iphone :D

I want an iphone 11 sir plz iam from pakistan i want a gift plz

&quot;How heavy is it?&quot;&quot;It&#39;s. Yeah.&quot;

Laughed so hard. Thank you 😂😂😂

whelp.... that warranty is void now... lol

“What is that? Velvet?” Haha, showing your age, Lew!

Indian stuff have their own vibe ♥

Yo you guys are nutz without bolts lol.

This whole thing seems extremely tacky.

Inception 😂

I am an indian

That is a South Indian Model Treasure box.

Anyone else expecting AirPods Pro in the box

I cannot wrap my head around the outlandishly conspicuous consumption this represents. Sure, it’s your money, set it on fire as you deem fit, blah blah blah. But to call this anything other than mindless waste is a fantasy.

Hey,  I&#39;m from kerala in India and I remember having one of those boxes in the house back when I was young. It had my grandma&#39;s jewellery.  It can still be found in some houses.

what&#39;s the music name at the end of video

Did you mean Leonardo Da Vinci?
I like this one is the box I don&#39;t give a crap about the phone I just want the box

Honor ur
did i really just watch a minute and a half of a spinning spin top...

Wow man get this 1% shit out of here

Take down the Instagram post. This video is from October. Fans already saw the video back then.

A cardboard box custom painted by a toddler would’ve been more interesting. All that for an iPhone.. the mind boggles.

Awwwww i was hoping the top would keep spinning forever

wtaf?!

Dude that thing looks like the ark of the covenant from Indiana Jones - don&#39;t open it or your soul will be ripped from your body. 😭😩

So disappointing when all that was inside was the custom iphone in a regular box.

Thank God Lew is on level one

OMG

That ist some &#39;day in the life&#39; shit

Exactly 2 mins 🤦‍♂️
<a href="">1:54</a> Which song is this ?

Poop

Yawn.......

for that price, i would want proper gold, not plated

Yes

I dont understand?  What exactly are you unboxing? Iphone in jewellery box?  Some limited edition iphone wtf?  Howd you get this box?

HAhahahaha lolx :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
The top was satisfying

iPhone sucks

If that spinner is solid gold...

I have one of these Kerala jewellery box. And mine is made of very expensive Rosewood or Teak wood.(one of these). It&#39;s also traditionally given to daughters to hold their jewellery when they are married off.

They were sitting way too still.

So I didn&#39;t watch the &quot;top sequence&quot; the first time I watched this video. It was fantastic lol. 💜

iphone sucks iphone sucks.  Every new phone always ends up looking just like the iPhone.

I like the box more than the Iphone.

Who would waste $2500 on an iPhone? 😂🤣

Basically we&#39;re just watching the top if it&#39;s going to stop or we realise that we&#39;re in a dream

The top does not fall. You&#39;ve been incepted.

The background music while the top is spinning is much more interesting than the phone

When you have nothing to talk about [!

wow luxurious..<b>takes out an iPhone</b>oh..

By far the best ending on unbox therapy

It&#39;s amazing what people waist money on, can&#39;t take it with when you die, there&#39;s no reward for who had the best objects while you lived, it&#39;s all worthless in the end, sooo what&#39;s the point when everyone can&#39;t own one and what do you gain from those who don&#39;t have one but someone who is less fortunate, it&#39;s all junk when a new one out does the next so why waist precious time, material and sight to make the best out of life. Everything is short lived. Period.

Thanks for stalling so the video is longer

Yes

Legend says that to this day... the top is still spinning

Wtf...............

It has a golden top, and a gold plated iPhone as a freebie! This is freakin&#39; awesome!

India loves you
What a joke

Its from kerala ..i suppose .

Yeah.I am gonna buy it just for the spinner.It doesn&#39;t matter if I can afford it or    not.I am buying

10% - talk about luxurious box5% - talks about customized gold plated phone85% - watches the adventures of the spinning top and sees how long it will last!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

<a href="">3:53</a> thanks

Should have ended it like Inspection.... Dislike.

I feel like how fancy the phone is. It should have had air pods in the box lol

best unboxing ever !! :D
I&#39;ll fight whoever chose that fecking font

Dude, 6 minutes long and at 3 you still had the fucking box closed...

I wish I had an I phone 😢

When it showed a iPhone I stopped😂

<a href="">1:52</a> Joker music😂😂
India 😍
<a href="">1:56</a>Could anyone tell me what is the name of the music in the background

gh

And there is legend that the spinner is still spill till the day and people are watching😂

3/4 of the video just watching the spinner

Bravo for sound effects!

Fancy box and iCr@p inside. At least he&#39;s got the keys to the box so he can use it. :D

&quot;It&#39;s yaaaaaa&quot;-Inbox therapy 2019

Lou: the keys to the box! <b>put the keys in the box</b>

It has that open ended fear to it because you never know what’ll be inside

wasted my time.

The ending was freaky...lol!

That was an experience of a life time to see a damn top till the end.

Lmao all that for a iPhone not even no EarPods with it

Soundtrack name?
Keep wondering what role of that guy at the back.

<a href="">03:40</a> lmao

The box loooks like a fancy panini press

Your videos are always the best

i wasted my precious time watching 😂😂😂

The dreams is collapsing

That box in like a heritage article in India. We uave it in our Showcase

This box was used for keeping precious ornaments in south india

Well they could have got wireless charging built in to that handmade box lol

who else had destiny 2 vibes with this music

Leo would be proud

Willy Du: Throws envelope like a maniac

Lol that was so random 😂

Just finished watching Inception less than an hour before seeing this. Good movie.

So apparently if you want a luxury phone you just put gold on it..

Imagine that ending to the sound of Hans Zimmer&#39;s Time.

How I gotta watch Inception again........... great video

Didn&#39;t showcase the iPhone because the screen cracked when he dropped the box. So here&#39;s 2 minutes of something that spins.The phone was honestly the most dissappointing part of this unboxing.

keep it weird, please.

Inception reference?

in its entirety

Literally almost fell asleep while watching

they cooouuuuld have chosen a better typeface for the logo stamps haha

<a href="">5:30</a> When im about to cum😂

Completely useless but a cool video indeed.

Waiting For The Spinner Stop 3 Years Later :

Yeah for all the guys who&#39;s racist towards India rub this vid all over ur face

Bloody DiCaprio had changed the way the world would look at a spinning top .....

I&#39;m proud to be an Indian....

the box looks like a Moroccan dish

Love from India

Super nice quality videos 👌 i love your channel
You are the best person in the world, you are good inarawend
sbscraib in canal

The ending was the most priceless part of the video

Can you demonstrate a durability test with that gold plated iPhone I&#39;d like to see you drop it from at least 10 ft

Made for the rich and Successful drug dealers.

So you get the best gadgets ever. Can I just be a terrible person and beg for you leftovers?

Wwwhhaat a soundtrack... Keeps thrilling me.

Meh.

LMAO one thing to complete is to have real luxury logistics, look at those boring   plastic bubble wraps and cargo box so not luxury. Again LMAO Real Rich We won&#39;t buy this kind of junk ;) yes, 4 seasons countries are fake rich. We are Indonesia, the ultimate richest nature on earth, world&#39;s stable climate, world&#39;s richest nature yet on center of equator line ;)

I&#39;ll be honest with u chief, that&#39;s a gross ass phone

I am an Indian.

I love the music....hehehe

India

When it’s gold plated but doesn’t come with AirPods

All that for a damn phone that won&#39;t matter in a few months

Basically all the <b>Luxury phones</b> just contains gold plated stuff , majestic box , some items. And that&#39;s it.

With the interesting spinner too inside???

Legends says : it&#39;s still spinning
It’s 2,0000 dollars o

why dont try a gaming test?

Is a gold edition

the spinner is there to remind you get to work and keep spinning to make money to pay for this iphone working at taco bell

These videos are hilarious 😂

The end😂😂

What would&#39;ve made this video super awesome, is if he would&#39;ve opened the box, took the iPhone out, chucked it behind him over the shoulder, and continued inspecting the box and the spinner.

Dig Will.
him: whoo my new phone with that gold lets put a case on it (case covers outside) ohhh

Inception spinner???????

Anyone else have the Draddel song in their head?

😂🤣🤣 Those face waiting for the top to fall!!

I’m not rich enough to watch this video

You think it&#39;s funny ?

ewww trash there was an iphone inside.

That phone goes with the $3000 speaker

What was the point of that last part like wtf LolXD

Wtf is the music 😂

Traditional kerala gold box/money box

Wrong soundtrack for the inception scene

Unboxing spinner 😮😮😮Wait why there is iphone on that table

India

So all of it was a dream @ inception 😂😂😂

this is bored

They should have included AirPods :(

The spinner was oddly so satisfying!

This thing with the top tho, lol

“How heavy is it?”“It’s yeah, yaw, yaaa”“Is this a new measurement system I didn’t know?”

But seriously, how can I get a box like that without the phone?

Forget the phone and top, I want the gorgeous jewelry box with key set! It’s so pretty! It’s dying to be part of my home!

(In voice of Tim Cook) If buying an inferior product for an outrageous price isn&#39;t for you, try Apple&#39;s gold plated line of products. These sleek new modern designs do absolutely nothing to amplify our already sub-par performance and costs 12 times more, but you&#39;ll still buy it.

anybody else remember inception movie when you see the SPINNER!!!

Go subscribe to my YouTube channel I do gaming videos and funny videos my YouTube channel name is excel gangMy sure you subscribe 😉

<a href="">1:53</a> ._. The song (hint kitchen)

He&#39;s in a dream!

If the box is overworked, <b>the product is crap.</b>

The spinner still spinning, they said

nice ending
I&#39;m questioning my existence this very moment

What do you do with all your stuff?

This is a dream....

You open up such an amazing box and just have the phone in its original box?!?!? Ishit

I feel jealous
I knew the design was indian i dont know how

How much is the spinner? 😂

I wish I could have any type of iPhone lol

awsome top thingy

@<a href="">4:40</a><del>INCEPTION</del>🤘😰👍
FUCK THAT IS ALMOST 2 MINS OF SPINNING TOP!

Van i be of help in anyway. Im from kenya no job no money no internet. I&#39;d go dig some gold for you. At this moment im down for anything for an extra buck.

How rich you are I wish I could have a gaming phone 😔

COME OOOOOOOOOOOOON. SOOOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTING

Legend says the top never stopped spinning

Proud indian🤩🤩any one from india???

He just pointed his middle finger to the camera <a href="">1:42</a>

That is one fancy phone box

<a href="">1:53</a>That’s the music that would go off in the morning for me to go to school

The spinning top is well balanced lol

I&#39;m so jealous of you but in a good way because you&#39;re a cool guy.

GUY! The dude said it was from india.

I cant believe I watched this till the end

Nobody Literally nobody Later: Hand printed.......loved you videos man

Plated? pfft. Next

How much for the spinner please?

that last spin round is awsm😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
This phone is for those who have more money than senses (actually, all iPhone apparently are lol)

Can I get the box and the spinner separately? They&#39;re amazing.

Would still pick the One+ 7T Mclaren Edition over an Iphone.

Hahahahaha STOP SPINNING ALREADY LMFAO
Yes.

How heavy is it?Yea!

aright we aren&#39;t in a dream

What a dramatic ending

Im about to steeeaaal

Im just disappointed that it was an iPhone just come on

How heavy is it? YAH! 😂

Did you mean Leonardo Da Vinci 🤣
It feels like it&#39;s  a holy box

Wow... great!!! Is this real gold??

My like goes for that introspective moment 😂

iPhones still suck

iPhone 11 pro sliver but 24 karat gold

So this is a top review...

Can i have it. I got a j2 prime
<b><i>IT&#39;S JA</i></b>

I want the top more than anything else in this video...

Aahahahahhaahhahahahhahahahahahhahahhahahahahahahhahahhahahaahhahahhahahahahahhahahaha...........It took a looong thyme for the top to stop

Moghul unboxing....
<a href="">3:53</a> is where it starts spining and <a href="">5:53</a> is when it stops . exactly 2 minutes.

The Aladdin Box 😍🔥

Bit too far.. haha

Do the skullcamdy sesh there in ear noise canceling earbuds

putting gold rims on an iPhone is like giving good clothes to a slave. Why waste money when you abuse both.

Why does it look like he sounds like chandler...

How heavy is it?Yeah

Are they high?  Cause i am

ok i decide i want that top.

You need to do a Figgers Wireless unboxing. One of the coolest unboxing experiences!

Unbox therapy: Watching the spinner with intense background score,....  Some in the studio fartsUnbox therapy: Yeah we are not dreaming.

<a href="">1:47</a> I understood that reference

i really just spent exactly two minutes of my life watching a spinner with dramatic music smh.

How heavy is it?Will Smith: Yaaaauhh!

Next video. Comparing a Samsung spinner with an iPhone spinner

I mean wow apple products still underwhelming and over priced even at luxury standards &lt;— not surprised lol

Just an Iphone Coffin that&#39;s all

2nd half of the video was a waste of time

an iPhone. and a Beyblade. meh

They should join Beyblade

Solid, Durable and classy.... receives an iPhone 🤣

That top is for the daber

Was anybody else curious if the headphones had been gold plated on the lightening connector too?

Hey robbers do you wanna know where he lives*yo mama*😂😂😂😂😂

“How heavy is it?” “Its Ya”

That&#39;s the top from the movie inception with leonardo DiCaprio

Tutorial:How to get money off a 3 minute videoJust watch a spinny thingy apin

<a href="">1:53</a> Grandpa’s kitchen 😭😭😭😢😢
Damn the Spinning top spent for 2 whole minutes

Lolol😂😂

In the end you put case on it

If anyone wonders if the Iphone 11 pro is goodHe cared more about the spinner then the Iphone

What happens with everything you open ?

And they say Indians r poor

Yo do you mind if I can get that iPhone 11 so I can have my moms iPhone 11?

Click bait
That is the dumbest way to package a product. The lack of aesthetic in combining your standard iPhone box (with a standard looking iPhone inside - yes, even with the gold rim and all the accessories that came with it) with such a box is mind-boggling.

Very common in IndiaWe have over too

Are we dreaming?
Silver looks way better so I ain’t every gonna get that

bro why the fuck did you slam the phone like that?

How do they get the money for all this😂

Holy shit

wow never thought seeing an iphone could be this disappointing

I came for the phone, I stayed for the top

Went to the bathroom ,came back and the spinner was still spinning bruh

Wtf

Fuck, that top is so satisfying!!

<a href="">4:13</a> willy face looks like hes falling into hypnosis 😂

it reminds me of Indiana Jones don't open
<a href="">5:13</a> and it finally stopped

What happened to the rugged iPhone?

For reasons I cannot explain, you are getting a like from me.

Ik everybody  felt that disappointment  when we saw thag iphone

@Unbox Therapy A yes, I have watched almost a 3rd of a video of some gold plated thingy spinning, which was included between the intro and Iphone unboxing. I am safe to say that this was the most satisfying video I have watched in a while, thank you :)

I wonder how many phones he owns

Yo I&#39;m from India ... I&#39;m was pretty stocked about this videoI mean it&#39;s very fitting for Lewis to get a 24k gold plated apple watch and airpods pro

All that just to end up with a shitty iPhone lol

Pls give me iphone 11 and i love your videos

I just want the top screw the phone.

Quite admirable...first time ever that comes to my mind about something..

This made my day hahaha

that spinner made me nap tho

Not good content...

How heavy is it ?YAAAAAAAA

How Heavy is it yes

Jack&#39;s face is like from Stephen king movie

You want that phone trying to buy something for son and he loves your channel

very interesting ending

.

I am an android person but that is the most absolutely beautiful thing, ever sent to you. ✨

They put the top there for a reason

What part did you like more guys, the unboxing or the spinning top (I liked the spinning top XD)

That spinning top put me to sleep

<a href="">2:44</a> song name pls

the thumbnail made me laugh out loud!

Unbox Vertu Phone
Me as a kid getting my third pair of socks at my birthday: <a href="">2:58</a>Me right now getting a third pair of socks at my birthday: <a href="">0:25</a>

Love from India♥️♥️♥️
This case costs more than the phone inside

Phonetherapy

That box looks more like a box where you keep would keep family cremation ashes in.

Can I have that box? Lmao

Nice

u GYS ARE SUPER LOVED WHEN THAT SPIND HAHA OWSAM ^_^

What was the song when the top spun the first time

Did you just spend 2 minutes playing with a dreydle? Also apple are a bunch of suck ups trying to buy your love instead of earning it with a decent phone 🤣

Is this hand painted?Yeah it&#39;s handcrafted.

I still have a 24k gold plated iphone 7 plus with a glowing apple logo.

Watching that spinning toy was relaxing.... I almost started dozing off!!! 😴😴😴😴😴

<a href="">4:28</a> me went the microwaves is on

Indian made
iPhones trash now
Watching the spinny top looks like me watching the nutcracker

That box is so tacky. The phone looks like something an Arab sheikh would love.

The day when unboxing becomes ...weird.  :(

I couldnt even afford the customized cable

what a waste of my time

The case looks like it holds a Faberge egg

gaudy trash

Now I wanna see inception fml😳

Ha ha ha the SUPER SPINNER
<a href="">3:55</a> is a whole experience when ur high

And if you do I could you it with my airpods

Box worth more and more useful than the phone

I would have make it my phone

My anxiety is spiking like crazy

Any Indians Over Here ??
What is the name of the box?

Top Spinning Therapy

at least they&#39;ve upgraded from shitting in the streets to shitting in a box.

the &quot;unbox therapy&quot; on the charger looks cheap lol

the spinner did not stop

&quot;how heavy is it?&quot;<b>&quot;YAA&quot;</b>

This man comment section so toxic😭😭😭😭

<a href="">3:34</a> oh no, is it a dream? ......😮😓<a href="">5:36</a> thank god, it&#39;s not a dream...

Expensive box for overpriced phone

Wow I’m glad that’s over

Yes yes yes
Stop spinning please

I didn’t have it before and now I do

I got anxiety

I couldn’t take it grab that top, pick it up do something

I thought is was going to be something special but when he opened the iphone box it was just a BRUHH momment

How to get Ur video over 5 minutes long

that just looks like a whole ass temple

More interested in the handmade box and top than the phone

the theory is confirmed , de caprio has been hiding in plain sight !

I want my 2 minutes back xD exactly 2 minutes watching that thing spin

Just bamboozled me to watch the heightened anticipation of the drop only to lead to the end.

Can you please write the link of this background music it&#39;s 😍😍😍😍😍

: How heavy is it?: Yaah.

The moment, when the price for that gold plated phone doesn&#39;t bother you, because it&#39;s not that much higher than the regular version.

He should’ve ended the video just before it stopped spinning with the dramatic music

Has gold but still no headphone jack

<b>&quot;The fanciest unboxing smartphone experience&quot;</b><b>Few minutes later...</b>Me: <b>Sees Iphone</b>Also Me: Oh shit

fucken iphone
At <a href="">1:40</a> he showed the middle finger

How much storage does the spinner have??

Nolan will see reality again

I would work for like 20 years to get this kind of phone I&#39;m for real I make 80$ a month it will take me like for ever to buy it

Hello brother I need this phone any how can u suggest me where i can buy it other wise give me this phone i will pay you

My favorite video of yours thus far! :-D The suspense was cracking me up!

Lol

<b>That top soon was crazy!</b>

What is the Background Violin Music played while spinning Totem ?

very very expensive

When the outer box is more decorative than the phone

wheres the pmw fans

Anyone else watch the 2 minutes of the  thing just roll? Cause same

I did NOT expect the entire last two or so minutes of this video be watching a top spin 🤣

I WANT IT

The best top in the world

<a href="">1:51</a> Carousel Sub Sub Sub Sub...
Sadly the half of the video is spinning the spinner🤣

Might b the best spinner of the world😂

Lol

It called  Nettoor box ...from kerala ..

Omg i need that box in my life!!!

nice box crap ass phone 😂

<a href="">2:08</a> bruh we never got to see if this reality is real or not

When you watch a tech channel and they spend 95% of it watching a top spin

<a href="">5:14</a>

Suck a fucking drag at the end

This video is too short. How can we make it longer?We could show the top spinning for like 2 mins?Brilliant!!

For those who are wondering, the song they play at the end is called Dramatic Swarm by Doug Maxwell.

when this is over?I&#39;m still watching it!I m not real?

send me a phone, my birthday is coming up this december

so dumb..... No one is buying gold anymore. BITCOIN IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD !

Everybody just paused is Thanos just snapped

I think the iPhone 12 will look like a spinner🤔🤔🤔🤔

Does he says it from India 😲😲😲😲🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This is not our jewelry box!!
That spinning top was so satisfying

Box 😍😍😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I came for the phone, and stayed for the top

The music is like in g-ni mukbang vlog

I hope to see you review the folding Motorolla Razor!

I was expecting a God tier phone. But then it was just a iphone

Yes, iphone is now manufactured in India too.

I wish the apple logo on the back of the IPhone was gold

Guys is called a Dreidel

<a href="">1:53</a> i thought i was watching grandpa funeral :(

Wow this video sucked

Man that top drama was really something

bruh the spin top was more interesting

oh man

Love from india

hi from 2050 👋

I &#39;ll report this video for containing porn. It is shameless what these people do!

I didn’t see this Coming

The rotation......the balance.....the wobbly wobble.....the end

Dude that&#39;s awesome

U r great Sir love from India

The video ended epicly 👌

Inception re-watch time

Rubbish
What do you do with all those stuff after you record the video?

A big hi from India 👋🏻

<a href="">1:52</a> song tittle please

What&#39;s that song called <a href="">1:50</a>

That box is much more admirable than the iPhone. Guess what it&#39;s from India 🇮🇳😃

iPhone inside. Stopped watching.

soooo why would someone pay twice the price of the asus phone for not even half the quality of it? just cause it has gold? 100% not worth

I really shocked when i see the iPhone...

this is just painfully vulgar.

Dun dun dun dun dun...hahaha
Wat a disappointing unboxing...sheesh
It spun for 2 minutes and 1 second

Who moved coments🚫

India

BROOOO THIS HAD ME DYING LMFAO NOOOOOOO I WASNT READEYYYYYYY LOL

fancy

...

As soon as I seen that golden top I was like &quot;I want to use that as my reality check&quot; then he said &quot;I feel like Leonardo Dicaprio&quot; and I was like 😮

Anticlimactic opening of the box; meh

That box is not widely used in India it&#39;s only used in south india mostly at kerala

<a href="">3:54</a> - 3-2-1 let it rip

That was the most intense top experience I&#39;ve ever seen... Besides when my friends and I &quot;Let it rip!&quot; At school

dude just made 30k from filming a spinner

For those wondering, the top is manufactured by the Canadian company ForeverSpin

<a href="">3:53</a> I want those 2 minutes of my life back!!! WTH...

UnBox the Horror Therapy begins at <a href="">03:50</a>. Enjoy... 🥶🥶🥶

The only nice thing I could have ever said about an apple product.... &quot;That gold spinning top was so beautifully balanced. Well done, apple.&quot; I guess I could also say that &quot;the new MacBook Pro&#39;s are also some of the most beautifully balanced paper weights.&quot;

What do you do with all the tech after you review it

Fanciest spinner unboxing experience 👏👏 love that gold spinner

That top gave me anxiety

<b>dubai stores be like</b>

INDIA

That moment we realised they sold a $2k plus Spinner &amp; Box with a bit of gold, only then we will understand something went wrong with our future, everything is so different from what I was shown the future would look like as a kid lool.

The music when he just sat there watching the spinner tho

Lol the ending was good

If there&#39;s a Gold it&#39;s from India.

Most intense thing I&#39;ve ever seen

Thank god it wasn&#39;t a dream

Like for the hilariously over played inception top scene... although I am aware it may have been able to spin that long on it&#39;s on.

<a href="">3:53</a> is this reality...

Where&#39;s the music from????

Our turtle box... In unbox therapy
256gig I phone 11pro Samsung users:those are amateur numbers&quot; I&#39;m not hating I love both but come on apple still 64 gig minimum really

Welp I just wasted 3 minutes of my life watching the top spin

Song at <a href="">1:55</a> ?

Yup I watched all of it!

Time just froze!

Things that we think one percenters would buy .. but they mostly don&#39;t.

its not a dream.

HOW MUCH DID IT COST

the music played is the same one played in grandpa kitchens passing away video. I cant watch the video normally

we don.t like I PHONE
When the box is more interesting than the iPhone

the ending was intense

thats a long of spinnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Give me back 2 minute

Better than A Space Odyssey

That spinner gave me anxiety

A wise human being would have to ask why have such a luxury unboxing for a 1080p overpriced ugly device this video would have made so much more sense if it was a golden Galaxy note 10 5g or even a gold plated one plus 7 pro phones that are actually worth the price sigh

The og beyblade

I started to think that they were in a dream which was in a dream.

No... nothing nothing... No... I don't regret anything...
Fonzi called.  He wants his shark jumping skis back.

I thought this is a clickbait HAHA

Guys Guys, you had the chance to cut the video before the top stopped spinning to the abrupt tune of the BG music and you didnt!?

Excited when I saw the title and the box until I saw iPhone then I paused the video to type this comment and will close the video now.

I watched till the end, I had to laugh at the fact the spinner was the gold in this video 😂🙌

The golden top casually spins

that reminds me of inception.

Bet you want give me that iphone

I want that spinning top

Ok

I got an i phone 11 proThats the dream    bye

<a href="">3:54</a> wtf

The title of the music plzzzz?????

UNSUBSCRIBE .L

How can we extend the video ???🤔🤔🤔Easy, by spinning a 24K gold plated top .. just an ordinary day at UT

Jeweller : How much gold do you want Indians : Yes

Terribly well balanced!!

Wth hahaha.i stayed till the end!!

This man just wants to make his video longer

The iphone in that little chest was O F F   C E T E R e d

<a href="">1:52</a>  Music reminded me of &quot;Grandpa Kitchen&quot; channel based out of India.

As soon as i saw iphone, i knew this would be garbage

Proud to be Indian

Anyone else got anxious towards the end of the video?  😂

This is art right there

It&#39;s a inception reference right

<a href="">2:00</a> same music used by grandpa kitchen :(

Inception ending
ok... its not a dream...

I am from india

Now we know the ending of inception

The box is called Nettur Petti.

<a href="">5:00</a> - Willy.exe not responding......

Man your channel is fucking awesome! My respect, you are such a genius

Ok...

This video&#39;s making me, want a 24-karat fidget hand spinner in 2019 for some reason XD

2 minute spend for that 24 karat thing spin

can you give me some phone because i dont have any phonefrom philippines

If I pay that much for a phone it better be a custom made phone from the ground up. None of this &quot;oh we took an existing phone and put gold or gaudy designs&quot; bullshit

How cute this spinner be

iphone sucks

Love from India🇮🇳

That spinning top is hypnotizing 🥴🙀

Indians Are Great
You have to review the Blu n1 it is a full screen phone and it is amazing for only $200!

Ok we&#39;re in base reality

Damn I thought I was still in the dream

Yeah it&#39;s yah LMAO
That short musical segment with the spinning top reminded me of an intro to to a death metal  song, I was just waiting for the drums and the squeal.

Disappointing video
I am dog song??

How can you make the video 5 min long? Just roll the dice.

<b>*gets gold 24k spinner*</b>Me: <b>it just got real</b>

Lmfao idk why that was so funny

Looks like my mom&#39;s jewellery box
Just curious, but what do you guys usually do with all the stuff you unbox in your videos. You&#39;ve uploaded so many, I figured there&#39;s no way you guys would just keep all of it, but maybe you could correct me?

That box is used for keeping jewelry in it. Basically Keralaian

Oh my god what the spinning fvck did I just watched :D

Congratulations: a certificate for unboxing an I phone 11 pro.
