Comunist propaganda everything is safe. 😂

Avoid rides in China.

I can not Here she screamed
My friend laughed so hard...😢 idk why this is disturbing

Natural Selection 😂😂😂

Poor girl 😢
what a way to go.. get flunged around 10 5 stories in the air, then get body slammed with proly 50,00 lbs of force to the cold hard steel.

The noise will forever haunt me😭😭😭😭

I&#39;m glad she managed to hold on for that long even after 2 spins

Oh my gosh rip who ever fell off rest on pace ur to young to die I&#39;m sorry

Good thing she didn’t die 😭

Wow

I felt bad for her and her family :((( she may rest in peace in heaven🕊🕊🕊
One day i fell off a swing chair ride and i broke my leg i was crying and i was thrown out off the seat it hurt me so bad

🥺🥺😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️ This is heartbreaking to see, this is really sad 😭
Something with this ride was wrong and if it had weekly or daily STRICT inspections this person would probably still be alive. This is why we have these checks in Germany. Parks are 40-50 years old and never had any deaths.

Back in June me and my mom went to the biggest city that we known and she brought her boyfriend and his daughter with us and we will in this ride there was four different places to sit on so we were just acting like kids and when we website down I felt like I was about to fall off so that’s why I hang down take pray to God because that was like 28 days ago from my birthday

I think when she was thrown off the ride her head hit the sign , fell and then the ride hit her. I feel so bad for this girl rip

Oh my

<i>________FLAWLESS VICTORY____________</i>

It&#39;s the fucking noises of the bodies slamming into the ground i saw another horrific video similar to this today about a 14 year old boy and it was not censored

It makes it even sadder bc she held on she didn’t want to die

Imagine this being the first memory you have as a kid that would be so messed up

Omg

It was a 14 yr but the captions said “woman”

YES :D

Holy shit

she didn&#39;t die i think

I’m so upset about this the way she was swung and then just thrown on the floor to be hit on the head snd die 14 is so young to die I would’ve been terrified if I was swung like that then thrown in the floor just to be hit and Parrish these rides need to be more surcure so things like this don’t happen!

I hate to see kids die on rides because it’s supposed to be fun but than it becomes so horrifying and it’s like your in a horror movie I hate it when this kind of thing happens and may the girl Rest In Peace and have a amazing time in heaven

some people were running away wtf

Brutal as crap. We don&#39;t choose our exit. Oh well

Wtf

what a shame to the girl who died she is stupid, the only choice was not ride duhhh

Never ride any amusement ride in China m they don&#39;t give a fuck about safety standards

at least it was a girl

I think the worst thing about this is, when the girl is being thrown around, the ride is still going!! what the hell was the ride operator not even watching?

I really hope her parents weren&#39;t standing by and seen this, it shouldn&#39;t be on YouTube either.

LOL Hilarious, You can see how she was hanging on for her dear life with that incredible pulling force. In the end <b>BANG</b> she dead HAHAHA the rail bent and im guessing that wasnt quick.

This is why I don&#39;t go to amusement parks. It&#39;s safer to stay home and eat.

She didn’t just fall, she got crushed twice.  Yikes!

damn shame
<a href="">0:06</a> me when trying to see dolls in etsy

rides are more dangerous now

<b>instant sueing</b>
I bet that happen in 2020 to because her arm was paralyzed because of the slam

Tf

Poor baby. R.I.P 😢😞
the railing was bent by how hard her body hit it.....holy shit. this is horrible. rest in peace.

omg when I hear her hit the floor and see her not moving just made me become so worried even more then i was at the beginning

This is why I dont like amusement parks.  People screaming for their lives and they call that fun.

My condolences to her family and friends. Rest in peace.

Rest in peace and fly high for that poor girl she must have been so scared and she hit that barrier so hard

First a clean BANG den a YEET
What was that bang

the sound....

People are acting like this is a regular occurrence at western parks. If you go to a park in a more reportable country (pretty much any western country) this is incredibly unlikely.

did she die or get seriously injured
yeet

YEET

Hahahahahahhaa

The video made me spit out my coke because that scared the heck out of me R.I.P girl

Omg nvm OMG :O

Is this an edit orr

rest in peace:( this is incredibly sad

Who tf forgot to put her harness on

China is shit

<b>Made In China</b>

That kid survived. According to Wikipedia.

Most of the comments on here are screwy. People saying they are afraid to go on amusement park rides yet they still keep going on them. Then saying they feel so bad for the young girl&#39;s family. Not to be mean but none of you even know her or her family. Granted you don&#39;t have to know someone personally to feel empathy over a tragedy but i know a lot of people including my own family, my husband&#39;s family, so called friends and coworkers that never expressed any sympathy over the fact that my husband passed away after being very ill for 2 years. He suffered horribly and not one of the aforementioned groups of people had  one compassionate or caring words to Express to me. I hear and see people at work taking up collections for this person that needs surgery and can&#39;t afford it..despite the fact that they don&#39;t know that person either. Every time I turn around they are setting up Go Fund Me accounts for disadvantaged people who just so happen to be people they don&#39;t know and having all kinds of collections for this, that and the other. That would be all fine and good if maybe at least one out of the bunch of rotten people I know had extended some common courtesy and decency to my husband and I when he was struggling to survive and we were destitute. People can feel &quot;so bad&quot; about strangers but not about people they know ??? Very weird, odd and strange in my opinion. I used to help whomever I could that was in need. But never again. Now I have no sympathy for anybody going through hardship and loss. Just like all the kindness that was bestowed upon my husband and I is exactly the same kindness I will show to all the putrid, evil, selfish, self centered heathens who watched me go down the drain and then had to struggle for years to work my way back up out of the quicksand I had fallen into. I had to claw and scratch my way out of a deep dark hole and I had to do it ALONE. No strangers or people who have known me for a long time ever offered me a helping hand. I was literally starving and they wouldn&#39;t even throw me a cracker.  No way, no how, no can do will I ever feel bad for another living or dying soul. You get what you give. I got nothing therefore I give nothing. And if all you people who feel so bad for the girl&#39;s family then go reach out to them and see how they are doing a few years after the incident. I&#39;m sure they would be thrilled to hear from you strangers

Oh my God!   Horrible!!   RIP sweet girl.  :-(
Bet she was too small for the ride and she didn&#39;t get checked

Did she die?
Lol stuff like this happens. I remember once at a six flags the thing popped off my chest like 4 clicks halfway through the ride and was so loose I could easily fly out.I was hugging the thing for my life, literally lol. I guess I got the adrenaline rush I was looking for?

NOBODY LAUGH

Poor girl :(
Oh my gosh poor girl
Can&#39;t imagine being in that exact situation, being in the same age. Imagine just having fun in the amusement park with your family and then this happens, rip😔

Oh damn did you hear that snap at the end?-

Poor girl, Rest in peace.. never trust cheap amusement parks..

The Wii remote when I don&#39;t put the wrist strap on[EDIT] hopefully she&#39;s ok...

Yee

Chinese manufacturer. Now look at Huss with their Top Spin and this won&#39;t happen

It always China bro

Epic video

Rest in peace

the fact that she bended the metal pole...this is why sketchy carnival fairs are scary

Fuck... It hit her so hard too wow

omg the ride crushed her rip

Jesus Christ. Getting body slammed by a ride is terrible

Omg this is so sad!! Only 14 and died trying to have fun. 😭

She do be dead thoOk ok im sorry

Poor girl she just wanted to have a fun day but it turned into a nightmare

Atleast it wasnt my favorite ride that caused this

That’s China for you, still sad 😢 though god bless her.

she really got yeeted damn

Oh my god imagine how the people on the ride felt when it went back down and squished her they were so close to her omg

Omg!!!

<a href="">4:00</a>

That was insane

I hope that that girls family feels better may she run with God in heaven... Amen. 😔

Poor girl rip to young😭, another ride I’m not going on .

For fucks sake people, she didn&#39;t die. She was knocked unconscious. Why yall so quick to assume?

Knock off Topspin be like

Omg thats horrible

Never gonna go on a trailer ride again

She might survive but when she hit the ground.   The ride hit her because it doesnt have much space at the bottom

This is why you should only go to amusement parks like Disney land, Universal, etc

Usa:about to falll but is safechina: people fall down rides and suffer because what Kevin said MADE IN CHINA

That&#39;s so sad it almost broke my heart how she is flinging that is very scary but I would like to say that she is brave

);

Some people are saying that she died and some are saying she didn’t. Is she still alive or what?

It&#39;s so sad I feel bad for her

Feel so horrible for this family. Rest In Peace.

Of course something was gonna go wrong the accident was in China

That think scraped her?! Rip

Bro did you see her arm?!?
Lol

Communist Rides

Ohhh darn China Always Killing People
Rest in pieces.

F

Why do all the amusement park deaths happpen in foreign countries

OMG... I feel so bad for her parents/family... Let alone her...  That was too young.. 😭

I&#39;m Not being mean, But If you play it in the slowest playback speed, It sounds like people being tormented in hell by demons. HORRID!

YOWWW!!!! I FEEL GOOD!

Yeeting the water bottle be like:

This is so scary the ride hit her when she fell thats so sad rest in piece

Thia is why I dont go one roller coasters. If you could controll how fast your car thogh that would be cool

So sad. It was not her fault

Oof

Is the back fence bent down because of her body hitting it? Poor girl. Just a horribly awful thing to have happened.

OOF

Horrific 😔 poor girl and her family x

3 reason why I don&#39;t like to ride the 360 Arrow at Kennywood.1. This video2. I can&#39;t handle being upside down3. I keep forgetting to take off my sun glassesIt&#39;s a fun ride though if you get rid of the glasses factor.

I&#39;m so sorry

I like that ride. Can I go next?

That huge bang was her body hitting something

That is horrible. So horrible.

Pay attention to the metal bars at the beginning. But then when the girl crashes.. OOF

Looks like she is stuck with her foot and gets flung with her head at everything to close before she is flung of and the ride hits whatever is bend into its path.

OMG as a mother this made me sick to my stomach!

OMG I HATE THEMEPARKS I WAS AT ONE TODAY AND I ALMOST FELL OFF ASWELL😔

I feel so bad bruh I hate those rides I just now wanna die and I notice she was black

OH fuck I feel like I fucking got hit bye a car idk if she r.i.p but also HOW THE HELL

Did that go the way you thought it would? I bet it didn&#39;t.😂😂

What&#39;s the name of that anime?

I&#39;m never going on a ride again

Now I know why ripsaw was destroyed at Alton towers... to stop this from happening, good on you Alton towers &gt;.&lt;

I refuse going outside ever again because i don&#39;t want any cancer in my life and shit like this.

Oh shoot

She&#39;s just from China who cares

That is sad she died from it

Well I mean... it is China.. never ride Chinese rides

Thats crazy.

Poor girl
Let the bodies hit the floor...

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

i was at a fair and i went on this ride called the ranger and it goes upside down and as i was going upside down the latch that holds you in came open and i was screaming and holding on for my life. people really need to make sure these rides are safe for people cause this poor girl died from a ride not being safe enough i been on a ride just like this at six flags i have always had the thought in the back of my head of something happening

lol

I don&#39;t want to go to to the fair anymore

this is why i dont like going on rides like this plus im afraid of heights

Jesus Christ

Gotta pay extra for that

RIP Rest In Peace/paradise hope u were alive

At chessington on the Vampire my seatbelt thing gave up and went up on the fastest part, bloody hell I thought I was gonna die but still one of my favourite rides

when chinese copy rides instead of buying the original top-spin from the german manufacturer...

Why do people like this video? Because the were amused? Just asking...

Omg! That poor girl 😱 RIP sweetie😢 what horrible thing to happen. Whe. I was 9-10 my dad put on this ride called the ring of fire and my seat belt was tight enough so my ass was off the seat so I had to put my feet under the other rides seat and my hands on the roof so I wouldn&#39;t fly out but omg it was scary I never went on again

R.I.P girl

A 16-year-old girl from Fengdu here died like this.
She died?....:(
omg the roller coaster hit her after she fall out rest in Peas poor girl💜

So sad. :(

Think the ride was Made in China... oh wait.

dam, that like bar. people make me sick

Love how everyone is scared of rides now after seeing this pile of crap obviously built in China causing this. Of course it&#39;s gonna happen. Not like it happens every second.

My heart goes out to the family.

I watched it in half speed and when she slams down it sounds brutal

MADE IN CHINA

You spin me right round baby right round 😂😂😂

Is that her body laying there on the ground at <a href="">0:09</a>? If it is I think that slamming sound was the ride hitting her body as it came back down, you can see it move after the ride goes past again.NVM, it was a coat or something that went flying behind the rails and that is the persons body laying there and what caused the noise.

A woman ?? Wasn&#39;t she a girl !?

I go to school here in CQ, and my Chinese-Canadian friend saw this happen

MADE IN CHINA

So tragic! she probably died the minute her head slammed into the sign !

Worldstar anyone?

I´ve worked as a ride operator and I´m thankful anything like that have happened while I was working...

I was on a ride at sea world and my latch bar popped up and cane undone while the ride was going. Things like this is why I&#39;m terrified to ride amusement park rides. RIP to the girl that&#39;s so horrible I feel so bad that that happened

this footage made me think twice to ride those thing

this is china so surprise there....

WTF CHINA

worst nightmare

How very sad. Thirteen is too young to die. Poor child just enjoying a day at the amusement park. My heart goes out to the family of this poor girl.

RIP

That looked like two people fell off? Or was it one?

Poor girl rest in peace
not ammused

nomames

This is why I don&#39;t do rides and I don&#39;t drive.

that&#39;s awful

DYAM!!
