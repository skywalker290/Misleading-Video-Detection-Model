I know this is late but, I believe; “F to pay respects” should be the meme of the decade. It’s the goto message for ANY sad moment on the internet.

Meme of the decade should be in hommage to the cancelled king of twitch emotes PogChamp. Pog will never die.

The news-article were hot for 4 hours and then vanished. Welcome to Finland. Every country has their effed up esssht, but Finland is on the next level because we have to look better than other countries. Napoleon flickery plus EU.

lol why would Meme Review be flagged for false information? it&#39;s MEMES. It&#39;s not even Pew News!After re-watching this...what exactly is the false information? Nothing was stated as actual fact. Are the fact checkers just not able to sense sarcasm or satire? Or was it the image of the morons Felix called out for being anti-vaxination morons? Their shirts definitely had false information.

The first math meme makes me wanna throw my computer. I actually like math but still infuriating.

the 6ix 9ine part of this video did not age well

yo i panicked because he&#39;s not on the floor anymore, until i realized this was a video from last year..... <b>i&#39;m disappointed in myself for not watching this vid then</b>

Out of all the gangs, floor Gang stands alone, the King

this  a weird time to be alive  why are they putting shit over a thumbnail saying false information of a fucking pewdiepie video it must be automatic i doubt anyone takes pewdiepie videos seriously unless hes actually being legit

Many of us use 3 in 1 shampos does that mean we can....Like if you agree

Press F for shitty Meme of the Decade

Imagine being a ceiling gang*this post was made by the floor gang

Doge..but pronounced Dough-g

Meme of the Decade imo would be Spongebob, Tom &amp; Jerry, Pepe or Rick Astley/Rick Roll, cuz people are still being rick rolled today.

Apparently, the Double Rainbow guy died the other day.

meme that started in 2000s, then became powerful in 2010s, and will go on for at least 4 more years.I say gotta be trump

out of all the gangs, he chose the mightiest. <i>floor gang</i>

This video got flagged for False information. WHAT....looks like youtube did an oopsy again

Watching this after double rainbow guy died

<a href="">6:58</a> little did he know that he would leave that gang to make his own. THE FLOOR GANG

Pewdiepie: &quot;I don&#39;t know what gang I&#39;m apart of&quot;Me: &quot;FLOOOOOR GANGGGGG&quot;

this sentence is false.

E

when u dont get the first meme because you are dumb: <b>sad noises</b>

Pretty sure PDP used to review “Bite of ‘87” meme before.

pewdiepie should have a podcast it would make secretly watching him instead of doing schoolwork sooo much easier

Spongebob should’ve won meme of the decade HANDS DOWN! He’s taken multiple forms over the years, he’s survived the golden, iron, and bronze ages of meme culture and will probably continue to prosper as a meme for decades to continue smh my head 🤦🏿‍♂️

<a href="">1:01</a> when you pay enough attention in math to know that a &amp; b controls the location of the thing, and x y z controls the shape. If more people payed attention in math class, there&#39;d probably be amazing potential for memes, just look at the batman equation.

IM CLICKBAITED

Why is this guy number one you tuber?  this is hands down the single most boring piece of crap I’ve ever watched .... ever ? And I watch trump speeches , he is not even remotely funny ?

Top 5 memes of the decade1. Trollface2. Spongebob3. Pepe4. F5. Doge (I mean, it was pretty influential to be fair)

ugandan knuckles should be the meme of the decade.

if keanu reeves had a biopic who would play him?

“Illegal in at least 54 states”

Gordon Ramsay memes were pretty strong for the entire decade, though I guess it has died down in the last couple years. I think it should be a meme that was used consistently over the past 10 years. Just like the previous decade&#39;s meme would definitely be lolcats.

Stonks

My meme of the decade is the trollfaces and everything like that (or maybe spongebob)BABY YODA

Do you know da fucking wae

MEME OF DECADE IS OBVOIOUSLY THANOS

Two years ago in eighth grade My friend and I started clapping and saying “meme 👏🏻 review 👏🏻” at lunch break over and over and then the popular kids started yelling at us “bum bum bum bum bum ur hairline” bc we both have widows peaks and we ignored them and still said “meme 👏🏻review 👏🏻” and then they started getting mad and reported as the principal and the principal called us to her office and we got detention for two weeks for harassing other students so we started doing it everyday after that until we got suspended moral of the story is if you wanna annoy popular kids yell meme  review

Not sure if memes are dying or I&#39;m just getting old.

Listen I think I know the meme of the decade not baby yoga not anything....... but prequel memes.....

<a href="">1:37</a> what ybox? shouldve been yboy omg

U seriously think scums who trashes public facilities/robs stores/attacks police and steals their weapons(and funnily enough not been shot to death like it would&#39;ve been in US)/setting people with opposite views on fire(if u haven&#39;t seen these it it&#39;s cuz western media is as biased)/geneally affects all residents peaceful lives and makes society fall apart should be person of the year? They are some of the more radical ones,  but other protesters agreed to their behaviours and let this happen, they even donate to them, they are as guilty.

Okay meme of the decade should be area 51 WE GOT THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVED AND WE ACTUALLY DID IT ON  T O P  OF THE FACT WE KEPT IT ALIVE FOREVER

<a href="">2:44</a> its a Scooby snack

Imagine....This post was made by John Lennon

Turning head blinking guy. He’s still going strong after like 4 years. Drake meme should get like 5th runner up.

pepe has been relevant since last decade when he was feels good man and feels bad man. Maybe wojak since he took off this decade.

JoJo memes prolly would&#39;ve fitted as well for meme of decade

<a href="">4:33</a> are we just going to ignore this?

Tom should be meme of the decade

Spongebob&#39;s been here for a hot minute, just sayin&#39; 🤧

The blinking guy

Big chunges

Putin...

Personally, i&#39;d choose the whole of gta san andreas as the best meme of the decade.

Its fine

SpongeBob

Baby yoda was best year of last decade let’s make it the best meme of this Decade too

The drake meme should be atleast top 5

Either F or pepe the frog or bee movie

DOGGGEEE

5 gum or confused John travolta

Me still waiting for a new closet tour

3 candidates for the Meme of the Decade should be: F, SpongeBob and Doge or Pepe

Meme of the decade - me, because I will live for years to come

Spongebob is meme of the decade, like common its common sense to have spongebob as meme of the decade!

Pepe, doge, or spongebob!

ROBBIE ROTTEN

“Why are there two of them”

Meme of Decade should be Bruh. It has  been there and will continue to be there in tinge future.

<a href="">15:08</a> spongebob has such a variety of memes and expressions and format literally any screenshot from a spongebob episode could become a meme so i say spongebob is meme of the decade

Dood Pepe is eternal...

Meme of the decade should be SpongeBob. This is because all of his memes have been relevant throughout the decade and are highly likely to live on because of their relatable-ness in daily life.

&quot;F&quot; for respect,LOSS and Ugandan Knuckles should be the top contestants

Spongebob is the meme of the decade!

Baby Yoda sucks.

This man is cute tho

<a href="">2:07</a> pewds its two of the stood up, like towers, with a plane in the background, PEWDS!

Pepe should be meme of the decade.

Bruh
The Drake Meme should be meme of the decade, cuz it won&#39;t <b>D I E</b>

Definitely has to be SpongeBob, dem memes continue to be funny and there&#39;s always new ones

<a href="">2:07</a> &quot;I don&#39;t understand this one, why is there two of them&quot;Pewds....the twin towers..

Pepe meme of the decade

The &#39;white guy blinking&#39; meme is definitely not the meme of the decade, CAUSE ITS THE MEME OF THE CENTURY！ THE IMMORTAL MEME :)

Probably the Rick Roll or Spongebob.

All your memes are belong to us

Doge

No review of......WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87!!!

I believe this is the first time I’ve seen a meme before Pewds has reviewed it

Pepe just makes the most sense to me honestly

this intro is such shit

Guys for memes of the decade, and we have to vote cat on table meme it’s quality

Meme of the decade is easily <b>Pepe</b> I had to edit this because he literally says it at the end of the video 🤦🏻‍♂️

PewDiePie said this is me when I wasn&#39;t born a trebuchet, but poppy smoria said the same thing.... Do they have the same MIND?

The two xbox&#39;s are supposed to be twin towers lmao

Who clicked on this thinking it was legit

When doge is meme of decade, press F to pat respects

F to pay respects should be meme of decade! I will always say it for the rest of my life! It has always been an amazing meme that’s still relevant

Meme of the decade has to be spongebob, kermit the frog or the star wars prequels

i must say: spongebob memes are overused as hell and will never be funny. this just in; memes about the pokemon noises in the anime (see figure 1.1- Victreebel)

uganda knuckles uganda knuckles uganda knuckles

THE BITE OF 87 WON LMAOO

Uhhh Felix the one you did not understand of the 2 Xbox’s they were supposed to be the twin towers that got destroyed

Stefan isnt the best meme of the decade. Stefan is the best of the decade.

Spongebob is meme of Decade

COPYRIGHT

Pepe all the way for meme of the decade.

definitely spongbob meme decade yes yes

Meme of the decade is Ricardo bro

My vote would be for Pewds vs Tseries

I think the &quot;DOUBT&quot; meme is the one that has moved into my language most... There&#39;s my vote.

Meme of the year: PINK GUY

No the -YBox

Pepe.

Y&#39;all mind if I self promote

I would have voted for Pepe 🐸 but the doggy is a good choice 👍

Yo everyone forgot about AREA 51! That was by far the longest lasting meme of the decade, and it physically got people together. Hell, people literally traveled across the country to be there. It also produced some really good memes. Meme of the decade definitely belongs to Area 51.Yo Pewds or Grandayy should really make a poll so we can vote on it.

For some reason i dont get your videos in my feed anymore and i knew something was up so now i just go to my subscriptions and check manually.

Spongebob should be meme of the decade

Hi Pewdiepie, I&#39;m from Brazil and my English is not very good, so can you add subtitles to your videos?

Spongebob is meme of the decade

pewds.  I have to tell you.  I&#39;m not rich.  But, for 99% of the world&#39;s population, I&#39;m RICH.  I can buy anything I want.  I can spend $3k on a fridge.  I&#39;ve spent $10k plus on computers.  But, I can&#39;t stomach paying $150 for pj&#39;s.  Tell me I&#39;m slowly saving the world by buying these moderately cute pj&#39;s.  And, yes, I love that I can buy pj&#39;s that match my wife.  But, I can buy that for $40.  I need a reason.
