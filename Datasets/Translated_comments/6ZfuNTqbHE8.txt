My god even the piano gives me chills

It has been so long since this happened. But it still gives me goosebumps. Whatever it takes

Those were the days.

2024 attendance folks .This is my fav movie .i know every character dialogues  i love you 3000
Best Marvel movie by far !   I don&#39;t know what happened between this and End Game, but there was a shift.

What Hulk is doing in this trailer? 

Its 2024, clock showing at <a href="">03:31</a> and my brain told me to check this vid for the only-God-knows-how-many-times have I watched this majestic art 

I don&#39;t know how many times that i have watched this trailer.Truely one of the masterpieces so far

It’s still the Marvel of this period. It’s good to watch.

Peak Marvel
The greatest official trailer of all time.

It was an event of a lifetime and now look at Marvel!

Anyone watching 2024?

Who else here in 2024?

feels  like jus yesterday i saw this trailer when i was  in the 8th grade. Now I&#39;m in college, nostalgia at its best , this movie will forever me attached to me forever 

Man to be in a theater and here that avengers theme starting a new chapter is gonna be awesome!!

Watching this in 2024

<a href="">2:00</a> Guys Hulk is literally running in his own look 

This will always be my favorite movie trailer of all time.

We need the MCU to be like this again!

This was my first ever theatre experience, what a masterpiece.

I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m crying ..

their purpose die with thanos

This trailer alone is better than all mcu phase 4 and 5

Time is gone 

This trailer still gives me goosebumps just like when I watched it at first.

Remembering the good old days before we got the marvels. Eternals and the rest of their agenda lead movies. What a time to be alive

lets just hope secret wars will also be endgame level

Kgf trailer 

I wish I could relive the hype for this

Listening to this bgm still giving me Goosebumps after freaking 6 yrs 

Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe……but this… <b>chuckles</b>…does put a smile on my face.

Take me back to 2018

Absolute/alternative/ultimate points of time.

Anybody in 2024

One of the greatest films ever

Idk how we went from so comic accurate and excited to scared and boring

Can anyone tell me why the hulk appears running with the Avengers when in the film he only appears as hulk against thanos

Watching this trailer in 2024

My childhood bro 
Peak Cinema right here. This changed lives and changed the industry forever. Shame it&#39;s in the past, but i&#39;m glad i lived it.

That scene where they’re all running rowards the screen with the Hulk never happened 

best of the best

Anyone come in 2024 to watch this trailer 

PEAK Era.
I&#39;m indian

This Definitely puts a smile on my face with some tears of joy n nostalgia (never been crazy to buy overpriced tickets first day first show expect here)

How do we go from this to what we have now. They threw it all away.

I&#39;d rather have teeth pulled without anesthetic than have to watch Marvel movies...

Wanda maximoff
Man I want travel back in time and I want to cheer for THANOS  in theatre...

6 years. Still feels like im watching the trailer for the first time ever.

LIFE WAS GOOD THEN

Hype engine blasts at infinity 

It&#39;s 6 years but Hulk was edited now also 

This was peak marvel everything fell off afterwards besides spiderman no way home

6 years?

Loved this 

I enjoy this trailer more than the mcu movie that come out after spider-man no way home

We need to ironman.Please

MARVEL JESUS&#39;S

Man that fake Hulk huhhhhhhhhhMiss savage HulkAnd shut up banner

“There was an idea” To create, a pair of movies, To see if they could become, the absolute best.

2023 is the worst phase of the mcu But am commenting on 2024 

mistake in this trailer hulk is not present in wakanda fight only banner is present in wakanda fight anyone notice this 

After watching a lot of crap from Marvel, I just forgot these movies still exist and are made by Marvel.

The only thing that would’ve made these movies better is having The Hulk be in them to his full glory … I’m still mad about that

I can&#39;t believe this is almost 7 years old and the movie itself is almost 6 years old.



Without a doubt the greatest cinematic event in history along with Endgame.



I was very fortunate to live this cinematographic experience back in the day.

This gives me so much nostalgia

I can’t believe it’s been 6 years already 

Nostalgic 
For those who didn’t experience the hype for this movie and Endgame a year apart and than go to the actual movie. Man those lines were long asf  glad I was able to see marvel since I grew up!

SIX years ago…
i still get chills watching this 

When is this movie coming out???

I miss the mcu...

<a href="">2:00</a> Hulk 
Gives me goosebumps every time I watch this

&quot;Ibambe&quot;
STILL GOT GOOSEPUMPS!!!!!!!

Peak MCU

Coolest trailer ever
Who are watching in 2024

omg i remember watching this for the first time

I like it  bcoz hulk 
Damm those days were literally gold  i miss those days

Cant believe its been 6 years already.

This trailer still gives me the goosebumps

Oh I didn&#39;t know Hulk was there in the Wakanda fight.

How did this appear in my feed after so many years

Marvel peaked in infinity war

6 years ago… feels like a month ago.

After 6 years youtube still recommends and We r still watching.. Just Masterpiece to the max..

February 2024 and still watching this trailer

6 years later still hits hard

It was still kinda terrible that hulk couldn’t come out

i cant wait until gta6 surpasses the views of this trailer

why is everybody getting like 

Waiting Avengers:Secret Wars

The excitement of watching both Avengers Infinity War/Endgame and Deadpool and Wolverine trailers are the same. I can&#39;t wait for another masterpiece. Thank you, Marvel! And I miss the OG Avengers TvT

According to my calculations, every single comment on here gets at least over 3 likes

Its 2024 and i still cant get over it

Remember when the MCU was actually incredible?

Best Marvel Movie ever made
I thought i had grown out of marvel and superhero movies but looking at the older movies and trailers i realise i am simply no longer a part of their target audience anymore.... idk whom the movies are for but it&#39;s kind of saddening

I still remember how I was hyped for this movie

I&#39;m still hyping
Anyone in February 2024?
Any dusted survivors?  IV
Another day, another time i&#39;m watching the top

453,714 comments and counting.......

Now 2024 and YouTube recommended the video to me again 

Oh god how amazing mcu used to be .

Who&#39;s here after Deadpool trailer

Anyone surviving in 2024?
Anyone else fricking depressed now that this is all over?

It&#39;s 2024 and this trailer still puts a smile on my face

Year 2024 : U can still find me here under this video 

Disney ruined marvel

16/02/2024

Unpopular opinion: Infinity War is not just better than endgame but best MCU film.

2024, still the best of mcu.

True heroes are watching this in 2024

Fun fact they started planning this movie since 2012 when avengers 1 came out that’s 6 years of planning it definitely payed off

Oh how far have we fallen

The good ole days 

Most exiting marvel movie
I miss this era so much️
Who&#39;s there in 2024

Idnt like this movie

<a href="">1:59</a> Sadly we didn&#39;t get to see Hulk being the hulk at this scene alone

Most number of views of a trailer in a single video 

6 years later and this trailer is still 10/10

I&#39;m watching this in 2024

Anyone watching in 2024??

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been six years, it feels like it was just one or two years ago, time passes by quickly

<a href="">1:59</a> hulk really wanted to be in this scene even though the movie directors didn&#39;t.

Peak of Marvel

Can’t wait for Avengers 5 and 6 trailers, it’s gonna be wild

Hello future people
Anyone in 2024 still comeback and watch MCUs most epic trailer?

Now Deadpool is coming ️
This was a special time what an event

Marvel comics yessss

This trailer is kind of a time machine. Whenever I want to feel the old days, I come here. And It works!

Ahh those days

Still the greatest trailer of all time

Its been 6 years and I am still trying to understand in trailer Hulk fighting in Wakanda but in movie there is no hulk Any logic behind this

Only the theme is enough for goosebumps 

When the MCU we all knew and loved was about to end

Anyone else here after the Deadpool trailer?

Who after the Deadpool 3 trailer?))

Who else wishes they could go back to this era of the mcu

I cant believe Digital Circus passed this trailer in views... I&#39;m pissed 

2024 and I saw it for the 6 time!  ALL OF THE MOVIES. From Iron Man 1 and also DC Universe Justice Leage. What our kids and will see in the future? Thouse are the best of the best!!!

God I wish could just go back in time!!!!

Hulk not came as in the trailer....

2-11-2024

Very fascinating

<a href="">1:47</a>

This trailer is unparalleled

 I love Marvel movies so much
Sometimes I come back to this trailer just to hear the music and MY GOD does it still hit like a truck full of concrete 

After rewatching this now i noticed 2 intresting things, they probably cut a dialogue between Bruce and Natasha at <a href="">0:25</a>, its her arm at the left, probably to get rid of their romance in a more satisfying way unlike the final cut version, wich was just them look at each other for 2 seconds and then a joke.



And the ending scene of the trailer, that its not in the movie as we all know, looks like a alternative fight were they all charge together against JUST Thanos, that is not the location where they fight the army, its that forest where they fight Thanos, and notice that Thor isn&#39;t in it because he was supposed to show up at the end just like in the final cut.

But instead we got the one where Thanos stops them one to one because they attack him one by one, which was a terrible strategy, it was very lame and without the Hulk too, probably Hulk was supposed to exit the Hulkbuster by smashing it when he sees Thanos, then to get beat up again, to make the scene even more desperate.

who in 2024

This was literally the last great movie made. And End Game was the end of an Era!! I still can&#39;t believe it&#39;s all over. Anything after End Game was straight out trash!

Good
Creepy monsters is a big battle
Everyone in 2024 feb 8

<a href="">2:13</a>   Thor: Who the hell are you guys? Pratt: It&#39;s a me! It&#39;s a Mario!

It&#39;s almost 7 years but it feels like yesterday I was waiting for the movie to release

Who is watching this in 2024

2024? Ya this still does put a smile on my face

The goosebumps, the anticipation, the hype… those were amazing feelings

Goosebumps 
i would do anything to watch infinity war and endgame for the first time again

Marvel was at its peak. I really miss the old vibe 

&quot;Final stage&quot; feel is strong in this one

anyone 2024?

6 years later and man! this Trailer still remains the best among every trailer i have watched

Anyone from February, 2024?

Oh my god, please take me back to this time
This trailer was amazing

The best movie in the world ️

Respect for marvel.. in 2024 it is still a masterpiece

Bye 
6 years ago........

<a href="">0:30</a> maaan! This part 

Hi

Casually comimg back to watch this trailer 6 years after

Bruh i still get chills from this man

Who is here in 2024?

I have almost watch this movie 20 time or more and it still gives me goosebumps whenever i watch this trailer. Russo brother you guys are legends, you guys are reason behind i and lakhs of pepole like me started watching marvel movies and regrets every single time why didn&#39;t i watch this movie in theater. But still i love you alot. Love you marvel for giving us this masterpiece. Even after so many years this movie feels like home... love you marvel 

<a href="">1:16</a> “Evacuate the city…engage all defenses…and get this man a shield!” 

Who’s here in 2024 to relive peak cinema

KGF CHAPTER 2 
Thanos is the messenger of Allah subhanwatala No God will improve His descriation reality will not go unpunished
Marvel. Please for the love of all that is holy, return to this level.

Come back now &amp; then. Most watched trailer EVER! It&#39;s buried down there somewhere but I&#39;ll gladly repeat it as best I can:<a href="">2:01</a>-<a href="">2:12</a>The moment DC realized they lost! 

Bro the best thing Marvel should do is have a repeat of Infinity war in Kang Dynasty (the hero’s getting whipped by the villain and they loose terribly ) and for Secret Wars they bring every single person who played a superhero role in Marvel or important role to fans back for the last time to defeat the villain and reboot the franchise at the end starting a new fresh universe it will be sad my brothers and sisters but this will still bring joy to my heart  a bitter sweet moment MARVEL 4 LIFE 

I&#39;ve watched this like 100 times and l still get the chills

Still get goosebumps everytime after watching this It&#39;s been 6yrs but still feels like yesterday

February 2024 Checking In
2018 was the peak of humanity

And yet I still get goosebumps and it 2024

Iron man
I LOVE U GUYS 3000
Marvels Peak right here.... I have probably watched this move 30x and still love it

Marvel peaked here

Still in 2024?
Now I watch this with nostalgia.

Its me on 2024 just visiting this magical moment.

I guess Disney was the Thanos if you think about where it all went wrong from here...

Goosebumps all over again,Is this last such Movie we saw?No Marvel please bring these avengers backs and use this BGM to create the magic one more Time.

Dread it , run from it , destiny still arrives 

at <a href="">1:50</a> there&#39;s hulk in the background, proving that hulk was supposed to be there, but marvel decided not to put him in for whatever reason. Edit: mb its <a href="">2:00</a>

This was the best Marvel movie ever made.

Wow 6 years ago

Crazy how marvel went from this to the crap we have now.

Best MCU movie to date.
Even in 2024 I still have goosebumps watching this trailer

I&#39;m from future MarvelPlz make RDJ back if u don&#39;t wanna loss

The last good marvel movie

Infinity War was such a legendary movie that people come to re-watch it&#39;s trailer 6 years after its release.

The four of you are excited with you hahaha 
There is no scratch on the avatar's beard haha
Yes, Thanos still entered for me, haha
Look at the entrance, hahaha
Dad, we ask your uncle's children, after the pollution turned into double Thanos, or is the pollution still modern 687!&quot;!_)[€[€}|}
The movie is nothing but the Avengers group, my God
God, I am crying
@<a href="">01:30</a>
<a href="">0:52</a> same feeling 
Who else has asked himself if he would do what Tony did, knowing it would cost him his life?

No One Can Match this Phase!

The start of this trailer is fire 

It was nice to see hulk in the trailer as he runs into battle
YOOO THE TRAILER IS SICKKKK! CANT WAIT
When I still imagine that if Star Lord had not struck Thanos, there would have been no Avengers: Endgame.
Only the ones who lived this knew what was to experience this

<a href="">2:00</a> Hulk was there 

When you watch this in 2024 hits hard the fact that Marvel is trash rn

Still the best trailer ever ‍

6 years ago 

Thats next level of Trailers

Still giving goosebumbs and still hyping us up. Thats how great this is

I laughed why Tony died.

&lt;/html&gt;

I don’t see marvel ever getting back to this but man was this perfect

Memories , Can&#39;t wait for avengers kang dynasty and secret wars it may not be the same but at least they bringing old characters back. Possibly avengers 5 and 6 will get pushed back because of what Jonathan majors did.

Memories , Can&#39;t wait for avengers kang dynasty and secret wars it may not be the same but at least they bringing old characters back. Possibly avengers 5 and 6 will get pushed back because of what Jonathan majors did.

Who are all miss the INFINITY SAGA LIKE here .

Miss when marvel was actually good 

how they show they hulk in the trailer then have him in the hulk buster the rest of the movie

2024 and I still get goosebumps.

Iron man 
For me , this was prime of marvel studios and the best movie they ever made

Till this day this trailer gives me chills..

@<a href="">1:09</a> reason for everything 

back for my usual viewing of the most amazing trailer ever

The Avengers 1 and this trailer starts with the same dialogue 

Who waited trailer of kang Dynasty and secret wars 

this puts tears in my eyes, why cant we go back?????

Goosbumps

Thanks for the best movie 
I remember being so cheesed that hulk wasn’t in the battle of wakanda 

Watching it again after so many years...still getting goosebumps

Now who&#39;re here for just see the likes and views 

Thanos real boss 
Me watching this at 21/01/2024 . 10.27 pm  And still feel goosebumps 

We used to have it all guys…..we used to have it all

Let&#39;s be honest,this isn&#39;t your first or last time here so I&#39;ll see you again soon :d

Who came here after watch the Dolby&#39;s trailer to test the deference between this two video&#39;s sound qualities. 

Who still watches this trailer in 2024?

6 years ago omg. The hype and build up for this was jus amazing

Making this comment to return to it after they release the Dynasty trailer to see how it compares. See ya&#39;ll then!

MCU&#39;s PEAK

one of the epic movie of mcu :) still favorite‍(2024).

Until they go back and see what they have done to from the past did keep people in suspense off the edge of the edge of the seat wanting more

You have to go back to school to get what you need so basically what the MCU need to do they need to go back to where they started to learn and get the idea and concept of what they have already done and add to what they&#39;re trying to do to make sure it goes what people enjoy and loved and add to what people are looking for in this time and what they&#39;re going to do to bring the same the Ed with the new that will bring epic enjoyable fantastic magnificent spontaneous

Until they go back where are they started in it all was just awesome Epic amazing fantastic everybody was in suspense loved it

Hi all.  I noticed a long time ago when the film and trailer came out.  Have you noticed that Hulk is running with the Avengers team against Thanos?

Hi all. I noticed a long time ago when the film and trailer came out. Have you noticed that Hulk is running with the Avengers team against Thanos?
6 years? In that time, I&#39;ve changed so much that I&#39;ve chosen the Tokyo Revengers over the Avengers. I&#39;m an anime fan)

6 YEARS!!!!

6 years ago...still feels like released yesterday 

In 2024

Back when they reached their highest peak

<a href="">2:00</a> v never saw this scene in the movie... Plus Hulk never turned green after he was humbled by thanos... I hate that moment.. <a href="">2:15</a> and guardians were not like that when thor was woked up ... They were holding guns &amp; knifes ready to fight.. They were like (anytime now let&#39;s begin)

Where were you the day Thanos...Snapped?

It’s 2024 and it’s still puts a smile on my face

6 years...

This trailer is perfectly balanced as all things should be

Movie name?????
Peak

goosebumps every time when i watching this trailer

Best Marvel&#39;s Movie of all Time  LEGENDARY FILM FOREVER

Did anyone noticed hulk at the end

Actual Hulk in the trailer... 

Hulk???? <a href="">1:59</a>

Hulk ???<a href="">1:59</a>

And get this man a shield. Goosebumps. Everytime.

It&#39;s been 6 years and it&#39;s still giving me chills and goosebumps.  Thank you so much Marvel for this

<a href="">1:30</a> epic soundtrack

Hard to believe it&#39;s been 6 years

Peak.

An era has ended
I still remember the HYPE about this trailer, the leaks and the first thoughts, even i remember going out from the second time I&#39;ve watched the movie, a kid was crying because Spider-man died, i tried to cheer up him and i told him &quot;he will return on the next movie&quot; 

Who else is here after 6 yrs??

It&#39;s 2024 and Marvel has still yet to put out something that is as hyped up or enthralling as this trailer alone...

Its 6 years ago

2024 and this trailer puts a smile on my face

6 years and still here!! best trailer- movie

all marvel movies are good and i mean movie after movie i just cant stop watching

It’s really sad watching this with the current shambles the mcu is in right now

Endgame ended this legendry movie with some sad scenes like tony starks dying

Nothing tops this. ENDGAME was good but we already kinda knew the ending how it would turn out. NOW THIS HAD GAVE ME CHILLS the moment the movie was over .

I refuse to believe that this was 7 years ago 

One of the most beautiful cinematic works with more distinction ‏
This Aged Quickly…

6 years later and the still slaps

This was the true end for the MCU

This show is still good after 6 years and man if only hulk and that ending scene was to become a thing

i will never forget this dialogue <a href="">1:00</a>

Am i the only one who gets teary-eyed watching this amazing trailer? Endgame was spectacular. Let me just say that. Absolutely epic! But Infinity War; well, that was something different. Something special. I loved EVERYTHING about it. The stakes were never higher. It was an event unlike anything I&#39;ve seen in theaters since Jurassic Park in 1993, Star Wars in 1997, and Titanic in 1997. Movies this good do not come along that often. And when they do, you embrace it. It was an event that unequivocally NEEDED to be seen on the biggest screen, with hundreds of people in attendance.

Who came back in 2024 to watch this legendary movie trailer ?

This is what Endgame should&#39;ve been. Not the time travel crap we got for a finale to the Infinity Saga.

2024?

I just came here to remind myself how glorious this franchise used to be before D+ and phase 4 sucked all of its magic out.

It&#39;s 12 January 2024 and this trailer still makes me feel good.

<a href="">1:42</a> Imagine you saw age of ultron and now you see vision getting attacked on his soul stone you will ofcourse go for the movie

Good ol&#39; Time

I watched the first Avengers trailer and then switched to this… i realized that it was an honor to be able to witness this all in theaters

This is by far the best marvel movie from start to finish

This trailer is so nostalgic 

Very excellent. I hope for more of it. It's okay
It's a great movie
Guys, just notice the theme song and background music in the trailer, i can&#39;t comprehend the amount of nostalgia I&#39;m having right now, I&#39;m so sad this is over, i hope the future marvel gives similar vibes to infinity war, this was ABSOLUTE PEAK

How is this 6 years old, crazy!

2018: Is there anyone more powerful than Thanos? 2022: Is there anyone more powerful than Wanda? 2023: Is there anyone more powerful than Loki?

how am i seeing this in 2024 rn lol

Anyone here in 2024

Once upon a time Marvel 

The quality is excellent and the transitions are good.
It&#39;s 2024, and this trailer is better than all the movies Marvel made after Infinity War

I can&#39;t remember hulk in this movie <a href="">2:00</a> 

That ending music… so good….
am i only one who notice hulk while they were running

It’s been six years and I think this Marvel’s best trailer ever. The hype was insane.

They want to see more new legendary movies from Marvel studios
I like this one ,thank u Tanos

2024, and still the most beautiful marvel trailer to ever exist

Watched 2024 6 years those days of infinity war and endgame peak mcu literally what happened mcu after endgame except nwh and guardian 3 all movie cringe seriously what happened marvel studios

There should be an award for &quot;best trailer&quot; category.

watching again ryt now!!

one of the BEST TRAILERS EVER MADE

Any one noticed Hulk in back ground

<a href="">1:30</a>
If you want to experience GoosebumpsWatch it again

Recommended to me after 6 years 
Marvel’s best movie to this day

: There was an idea.

Good video 
We all still remember when the world stopped to watch this trailer right

The film is, to say the least, one of the most luxurious science fiction films 
After watching every marvel movie I believe they can’t top this level what a masterpiece 

Excellent work
Good 
Even the trailer had a great post-credits scene  ... What a year

nice
The first time I watched this movie everyone left the cinema when it ended feeling like they had lost someone dear to them. For me it was like I had watched the death of the Incredible Hulk only it was a billion times more painful. I left that place knowing Dr. Strange had clearly given Thanos the time stone for a reason.

Masterpiece of a trailer! Masterpiece of a movie. The way they brought all those characters together. Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Black Panther, The Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Asgardians, Thanos and his Black Order all in one movie. Masterful storytelling, completely unprecedented.

6 years and still can&#39;t believe it has been 6 years !

fantastic
My friend : you in the premier night right spoil me something Me : everyone dies......My friend : come on tell me something.....Me : <b>look him in the eye</b>My friend : No.......

From the ingenious Captain America, tech wizard Iron Man, and powerful Thor to the always angry Hulk, immensely clever Black Widow, and conniving Loki, all the characters irrespective of being a hero or an evil villain have thoughts on how life can be and words that can get you through some tough situations.The end of Phase 3 brought all the heroes together to fight off one imminent threat. The Avengers banded together to defeat Thanos one last time and get back the blipped population. Tony Stark was the unnamed leader of the gang and always mobilized them to do their best, not knowing that this would be the last battle he would experience alongside his friends.

It&#39;s insane to me that this was 6 years ago now

Fun fact, they gave only Thanos the first 2 infinity stones just for this trailer and made Bruce being able to turn into the Hulk

For me this was the absolute best Marvel movie, even better than Endgame. I remember the unreal hype like it was yesterday!

Its 2024 and this still gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.

2024

The best comic book movie there has been.

&quot;6 years from now&quot;

Anyone in Jan 4 3024

Any one here in 2024

a hell of a run, marvel ...never get tired of hearing thanos’ “quotables”.

It could be the year 2050, GTA 6 still won’t be out, but at least this trailer will always put a smile on my face.

I feel so unlucky that i couldn&#39;t got chance to watch this masterpiece in Theatres   

marvel peaked here ?no, cinema peaked here.

Who&#39;s here in 2024?

Watching this again and I just realized the beginning dialogue of this is the same as the first avengers movie trailer

I still remember the hype of those years

Peak Marvel 
the amount of weight this movie had on release. how everyone tuned in for this, and both movies paid off. still chills

I thought this film was really good, I highly recommend it!
2024 and still can&#39;t get over the fact that marvel is over. The classic MCU experience was something else. It cannot be replicated.

Heck 6yearsago
hi iam thamilan

Sheeeshhhh

Yes, I adore 
Why in Agent Of Shield Season 6 doesn&#39;t mention about the Snap?

2024 2nd Jan bt this trailer amazing

Black Panther, we miss you buddy.

Who else is here in 2024? 

I wonder when the next big thing for a cinematic experience like this could come. For all I know, MCU is way far from regaining this kind of hype again.

&quot;And get this man a shield&quot; givies me goosbumps everytime

started 2024 with watching Avengers Endgame

Whos here on 1st January 2024?

Greatest part of the trailer is Hulk in Wakanda.

Infinity War was 6 years ago today. We&#39;ve.... grown up.

SddS

Happy new year 
First comment of 2024

It’s 2024 and this trailer still puts a smile on my face

Rewatching this era of marvel was HYPE but I hope they get better releasing movies like back then

Who&#39;s here in 2024

2 days till 2025 n still watchin this

Avengers: Infinity War is one of the biggest Marvel movies and one of the best. Everything like the insane budget, the huge amount of incredible effects, music used epically, the crossover of characters, and consequences for once.

<a href="">1:59</a> me and the alt accounts coming to defend one of my homies Also false advertising for the combined it with the hulkbuster made it seem the avengers were United here because it seemed Ironman was gonna be in black panther land (yes I know the name )<a href="">1:59</a> me and the children in my basement trying to escape the hurricane back a while ago

Tes

Hell no, not yet!

I&#39;m curious if GTA VI trailer will beat this in views, honestly I don&#39;t think so but we&#39;ll see, it beat the Endgame already.

Duffman said it best

Which is better Infinite War or Endgame?

Back when the MCU was at its peak 

My old friends, Og Fortnite, peak mcu, peak Youtube, Infinity war, and my youthful childhood energy, this will be a time to remember

It&#39;s December 2023 and here I am watching this, even though the years have passed, this trailer still looks amazingly incredible, I wish the MCU would once again excite and surprise like before

6 years of Hulk Scam in this trailer 

A very beautiful movie, I did not expect the ending 
What ever happened to Marvel……

Awesome high quality, continue your creativity 
Just end this awful multiverse saga and do the mutants like  the infinity saga

Without Iron Man Marvel is incomplete ..
This trailer will always be remembered as the greatest goosebumps trailer ever.

The MCU has a lot of potential to continue giving us tremendous gems of sagas but it has gotten out of hand
The Best Trailer of History 

This trailer is probably the greatest movie trailer of ALL TIME!!!

Infinity War -----------------------Endgame 
After five years things are not going well for MCU ... We re missing old times

Nothing in the MCU will ever top this point

I&#39;d Forgotten The Excitement Of Not Knowing, The Delights Of Uncertainty.

2024

Very good
When marvel its on peak.. ️

life will never be the same

<a href="">1:37</a> i used to watch that all of the time. I knew from that point the Avengers needed everyone.

6 years later and still the hardest movie trailer to ever drop

this trailer is better than 60 percrnt of movies....

Legend if you&#39;re here

Dread it Run From it Destiny Still Arrives Fuckin Goosebumps Righthere

Infinity war movie is a loop 

Peak movie, peak life
Pov: when marvel studios made good movies and not the crappy ones now
ANYONE IN 2024
GTA 6 is coming for this trailer next

6 years ...

I was so happy spider-man was in this movie

mcu

Who is here in December 2023?? 

nostalgia ;;;;((}}
Peak of Marvel.

Whatever it takes.....

Best film at any time (2 days to 2024

Its an emotion it will be forever

Still full of body getting goosebumps ....dread it run from it Destiny still arrives.....and get this man a shield ️...and that background score just elevated whole thing

Infinity war alone was better than every Avatar movie combined ‍️

Greatest Trailer Of All Time
W

After 6 years, it&#39;s still the best movie trailer I&#39;ve ever watched.

I hope Avengers 5 and 6 gives us chills like this, Kevin Feige is definitely working hard to get marvel back to what it was

Why is this so currently nostalgic? 

This was the absolute peak of Marvel, I highly doubt we will ever have something on that level
After 6 years I see the trailer for Avenger Infinite War again, which made me scream with excitement for wanting to see it in the cinema!!!
best marvel movie hands down
Who&#39;s watching this in 2023?

pure goosebump trailer

Thanos is arguably the most charismatic villain in movie history. “In time you will know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, that to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.”

 I remember when I watched this film in theaters !COME BACK 2018!

This along with endgame and spider man no way home were the best marvel films made back in the days .

 someone give me a time machine
The next one is endgame

I still don&#39;t understand why is there HULK in thumbnail...

&quot;...so when they needed us, we could fight the battles, that they never could...&quot;

I’m sad it’s over but I’m happy it happened. We will have many more great experiences in our lifetime. We just need to accept change. I turn 18 in 30 minutes. Im ready for the adventure.

Only thing that would&#39;ve made this an even better masterpiece is having Hulk run into the battle in wakanda for a rematch

To this day I remember the first time I saw this trailer and the first time I saw it at home alone, I looked like a retard screaming, I miss you...
&quot;As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist &quot; the last words of wisdom from Thanos who predicted even Marvel&#39;s future decline 

This hands down the greatest trailer of all time I don’t care

Peak of MCU  ... never going to get anything near anytime soon ... even Avengers 5/6 ... The way it goes seems like that....

MCU is dead, DC here we come

Bring back Jonathan Majors he did nothing wrong, you guys kept josh brolin and Jeremy renner

This is the best thing marvel did.

This does put a smile on my face.

Still the best MCU trailer

This trailer reached 150M in 4 months, GTA VI trailer reached 150 in 10 days. That thing gonna be the greatest game till date or the greatest disappointment ever, No in-between

Nothing will ever be this hype again

Clear Endgame

It’s been over 5 years since this movie’s release now in 2023, and it was the greatest superhero release of all time. The hype, the timing and the execution. In one word PERFECTION. Back when marvel had its own fan base and not everyone knew about it

Still miss the old Marvel dec 2023

almost 2024 still the goosebumps

<a href="">01:59</a> the green Hulk running with his alliesnever happens in the released movie.

Lol I never noticed that they show Hulk in wakanda, but hulk was no show in wakanda

This is one of the best quotes I&#39;ve ever heard from Thanos man. Why wasn&#39;t this in the movie???? <a href="">1:37</a>

To think that me and my older brother watched this trailer together when it dropped and watched it in theater and unfortunately he’s no longer with us. It definitely changes the dynamic of watching it again

I know people who watched Infinity War in the cinema and they don&#39;t watch Marvel anymore, I think they are doing the right thing.

I hate myself for not being able to watch this movie in the cinema

It was the best production I&#39;ve ever watched in my life.

It&#39;s almost 2024 and this trailer still excites me

GTA 6 will eclipse this

<a href="">1:54</a> - <a href="">1:59</a> - <a href="">2:02</a> Like bro it’s 2023 and about to be 2024 and this still hypes me up I swear bro like this trailer will never fail me and this is the best avengers  movie that was ever created 

I came here all along just to get some more of this

MCU died after Endgame period!

Bro don&#39;t be stupid he literally admitted dat in end game

Gta 6 trailer gonna beat it and become number one of most viewed  trailer of all time  its just matter of time

First trailer feeling after 5 years after the snap 

IM SO HYPED THIS LOOKS 
6 years 6 fricken years

Anyone help me with thisi&#39;m quite sure in this scene <a href="">1:49</a> Thanos had 5 stones?Did they not reveal the other 3 stones on purpose or am i wrong?

The world needs REAL life Avengers like this 

I want this as a tattooWritten in the font of everyone&#39;s linesSamuel L. JacksonRobert Downey JrPaul BettanyChris HemsworthScarlett Johansson

Its been 6 years,but everytime I watch it,it gives me goosebumps ️‍️‍️‍️‍
Mallus come here

Dear Marvel entertainment...We will see movies like this again??? Stop please with feminism fails

Still here
How is thanos hardest quote not even in the movie

Art of making trailers- Marvel&#39;s

Still all these years later endgame and infinity wars trailers give me chills

After this and Endgame, the MCU was never the same or as good as it was.

Please come back RUSSO BROS

I miss how I felt when I saw this

OV MY GOD 6 yearsssss i can&#39;t belive thisss

This movie gave Thor justice 

Dang we almost won this war

Re watch 2023 

The new generation of Marvel will likely never see another movie with this much hype behind it.  Sad

Nothing can match Infinity War, Endgame may have made more money but the hype that Infinity War created was insane.

Back in the day when all you could think about is when another Marvel movie was coming out

GTA 6 will break the record

Peak cinema

2023... Anyone here watching this masterpiece again???️

End game is better tho

Golden age of marvel

buuu
goosebumos throughout

Which is more epic, GTA VI or Infinity War? Apples and oranges. Also both insanely epic pieces of entertainment anyways.

End of 2023 and I still get chills watching this trailer

why hulk running out at <a href="">1:59</a> he ain’t want no smoke in the movie 

PEAK MCU

Anyone2023 December 
Here to reassure myself on how brilliant Marvel was, compared to the torture it has become now.

Still gives me goosebumps even tho I watched it four years ago

Avengers infinity war and endgame  were last best movie from mcu

I organism at the end of this trailer every time lol 

Have never watched this or End Game. Which one should I watch first?

<b>Ha, ha, Hulk...</b>

amogususimpostorssusususususus
Live peaked on Nov 29. 2017Nothing in life gives me the same chills and hype like this anymore

Peak MCU. Peak Hero’s. Peak Villian. Peak Cinema.

You had to be there to understand the hype...

The wisdom in this content sparked significant personal evolution. A similar book I read was critical in my journey. &quot;The Hidden Empire: Inside the Private Worlds of Elite CEOs&quot; by Adam Skylight

Here just to check the likes and views cause of GTA VI

Who else is here just to check the likes because VI became the most liked trailer ever on yt?

Jesus loves you!
Jesus loves you!
GTA VI &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

All time blockbuster trailer 
Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Infinity War Official Trailer is the first video I’ve seen from Marvel Entertainment and I WISH I saw all of the Marvel movies besides the Tobey Maquire Spider-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy movies when this came out. This was such an exciting time for Marvel that we may never get again.

6 years…

I wish a villain can come in and snap thanos back he was the real deal

Real data : KGF 2 is the highest ever watched trailer on YouTube 

I&#39;ll be honest, I cry every time I turn on this beauty after all these years.

GTA VI has like double the like count of this now.. how long until it surpasses the view count?

Who’s here after GTA VI surpassed the like count?

6 years ago 

This trailer will forever stay in my heart

GTA VI &gt;&gt;&gt;

GTA might surpass this trailer 

Gta Vi suprased it&#39;s like whitin 2 hours

Even now I am getting goosebumps in the final scene

GTA 6 now surpassed this and became the most liked entertainment product trailer of all time. All in just 2 hours

GTA 6 trailer just surpassed this in likes

The best marvel movie

I'm just remembering when I saw it for the first time and had that emotion. Now 6 years have passed and I long for the same emotion.
This is something that has only been done once and will never be done again, MARVEL THE GOAT!!!!!!!

hypes me up every single time

In hate how they show the hulk at <a href="">2:01</a>He&#39;s not in that scene in the movie.Scam

GTA 6 will beat this Trailer

Who is here in 2024

When Marvel is at its PrimeAnd Endgame being its last part of a golden age era for marvel

Stilll fire and hits you in the feeels

Now that it’s 2023… I just wanna say; I’ll never stop believing in that old fashioned notion, til the end of the line.Assemble.

Any know  KGF chapter 2 

The way Thanos drops exclusively cold quotes

I just realized the hulk is in the trailer during the last battle 

The best marvel movie of all time

6 years later I’m back just to watch this trailer again

Still gives me goosebumps after 6 years 

Even MARVEL&#39;s trailers are better than any other superhero movie But this is the end of the era after Endgame.... 

Good times :&#39;)

What a time to be alive, i miss them days sitting in a movie theater fully locked in on amazing marvel movies. Cant get the feeling anymore like how i use to them days was amazing i would kill to go back

The FilmMarvel Studios️ Avengers Infinity️ War (2018) OfficialTrailer The Full Movie Marvel Avengers Infinity️ War[2018] <a href="">00:00</a>Lego Marvel Avengers Infinity️ War{2018}
5 years has passed since this legendary trailer was released.

Infinity war and endgame was a festival

Damn,6 years

Happy 6 years to this amazing trailer!

Best film

Great movie 
It’ my favorite 
6 years later and this trailer still gives me chills

Is it weird that this was the greatest film of all time and basically the end of the Marvel and universe as a whole?

Unbelievably cool trailer
I return 6 years later to return to what made me happy as a child

Cool video! A sea of ​​impressions!
Great trailer. It's breathtaking.
6 years️
&#39;Marvel Studios Avengers&#39; left an impression with a mesmerizing preparation for an incredible adventure. Spectacular visuals, epic music and the promise of an exciting story make this film a must-see for all Marvel fans.
Hulk running in the trailer and not see him fight in this one killed me inside and then end game came snd im still death cause professor hulk is not what i envisioned but other than that best movies ever

Great
I love it 

Cool movie
They will never understand the hype…

Cool movie I recommend
Like!

 great
Very cool. Definitely need to see the film.

Cool movie!! I recommend it to everyone
Really enjoyed the trailer for the film. Thank you Marvel for another masterpiece.

Spectacular! Great movie!
Great story
No way its been 6 years since this trailer came out

It&#39;s time to move on from Marvel and Disney. They went on a path that&#39;s not going to change. Just enjoy the good times like this trailer. It&#39;s even better than Ant-Man 3 and The Marvels whole movies

The movie is wonderful
Peak of cinema

6 years is wild!

Having the hulk in the trailer is the biggest rick roll in Cinematic history 

No way it’s been 6 years remember getting the notification for this

I don&#39;t and have never fancied Marvel but this trailer is just peak

Today 6 years, wow

This trailer came out 6 years ago today and I still get chills watching it

Cant believe its been 6 years since this trailer came out 

Holy crap it’s been 6 years ALREADY!? It only felt like YESTERDAY. I remember sitting at home, going upstairs, and clicking on YouTube, and the first thing I saw on my recommended section was this masterpiece. I watched it and immeadiately it became my most anticipated film of 2018. Everything caught my eye and hyped me up, the visuals, THANOS, but most importantly seeing all of these iconic heroes finally team up. I remember doing the same exact thing for Endgame.Good times, back when the MCU was at its peak and we could expect something good out of Marvel. This trailer IS and WILL FOREVER BE apart of HISTORY for eternity.

As someone who watched the first main movies, and was only moderately interested in the MCU, believe me, I felt the hype and epic-ness when this trailer finally dropped! I worked at a theater and all of us were so excited to see what happens, and even more for End Game.

I’m still hoping one day, just one day. The MCU will gain this type of hype again

Can’t believe it’s already been 6 years 

Thanos&#39; words - in time you will know  what it is like to lose... I feel he presumed the current state of Marvel. 

It&#39;s already 6 years after this Trailer Broke the entire InternetAnd put the highest Peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe 

Still chills
It’s been six years since this trailer came out. I still, to this day, get a chill down my spine when Thanos shows up. We all knew he was going to be a major threat. And he delivered, in spades.

This trailer was released on birthday no way 

Can’t believe it’s been 6 years already

this does put a smile on my face

Some people in my 6th grade class at the time tried to spoil it and i got pissed so i moved tables and then went and watched it

Maaan leaving it with the guardians just standing there smiling to finish off the trailer is underrated!!!
