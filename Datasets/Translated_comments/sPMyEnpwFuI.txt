Ye itani masoom face wali actress achanak chudail jaisi kaise ban gayi 

Shithole bollywood. I don&#39;t support them.  She was really beautiful.

Salman is a criminal from backside. In movies or publicly he shows himself very charming cute sweet gentle and helpful person. But the truth is that he has destroyed the carriers of many young emerging artists in bollywud ( vivek oberoi/sahil khan). Being human is to show his good image in public or to hide the crimes he had done behind.

Mahesh Bhatt is the one who has ruined everyone's careers.
️️️️Oh my Almighty she looks so very beautiful n charming as before even after what she has gone through. I feel her successful period in her early life as a model n actress gave her so much confidence n determination to keep her alive up till this stage. And when she became over confident n egoistic, she was brought to face an accident so that she could come down to ground from the height of fame. But her confidence, determination and not over confidence helped her to survive upto this day. The support, love and care from her dear n close ones helped her in this process. The rest all is secondary n tertiary. This above claim is from a real-life girl&#39;s example  who had fallen from 4th floor, broken all bones, in coma for 3 months n who survived with confidence, determination n hope is now married with two kids n living a happy life. May Almighty bless Anu  .....

Is she Anu?

In this line, you have to be careful, because you cannot escape of selfishness .

U are look so pretty mam

She is still a beutyfull woman god help her to make again a good celebrity in bollwood ️️

stop using the fake thumbnail for clout

She was too attractive.  It&#39;s TRUE ,luck means a lot

Anu Agarwal was a model, a graduate in sociology from Delhi University and came to the industry by being begged by a hungry Producer who even made a film based on her personality, recruited Rahul Roy who didn&#39;t even know the story till later on, the film which became her blockbuster debut film, watch the interview with Nikki Bedi. Looks she had, talent she possessed and brains as well she saw life a bit differently than others in her time, actually, her mindset is more common in today&#39;s time but that&#39;s enough to tell you she&#39;s a smart woman ahead of her time. For those who just love spreading hate on certain celebs cause of the trend or your ego is jealous, or your specific fandom to certain celebs who got the backhand due to their career choices don&#39;t even comment it will be clear who and what you are. There was a reason for Anu&#39;s turnabouts and it is a simple task, take a look back in time, the audiences have to do this, watch Anu&#39;s old interview&#39;s, understand her behavior and character, her poise. Anu was brave to tell the world, what she felt and how she felt about her experiences but she didn&#39;t mention everything because of fear of death which left her so traumatized she tries to cope with it by behaving like her old self, dressing the way she did in her youth if she is coming out in 2020 and dropping these hints its because she believes in the power of the audience and left hints in this video but most of the masses didn&#39;t see the message, for those in the comment section bashing Salman Khan, yes he has a lot of controversies attached to him but nothing has been concrete enough to take him down, Law in India took down the likes of many actors senior and junior to Salman such as Sanjay Dutt but last I checked even he is still doing films and even bigger projects than before Jail!, so stop being a hater and throwing all the blames at Salman when all the crimes and all the murders are simply being done by a puppet master behind the camera people. There are stories about Big B and his co-stars especially Praveen Babi, and how many other stars, many stars are coming out and telling the world about the evil ones but yet the outcomes come as if predetermined, I grow very distant from people and their way of thinking, I am glad Rhea is in Jail and I will love to see what she says, who she will point out next. Sushant didn&#39;t deserve to die especially not by his dog&#39;s collar and have his neck punctured with holes due to the spikes, the man died with fear of death in his eyes, not suicide, I beg for this to end and the culprits are found and persecuted. Ek producer larki ke sat sex karke films banta hai aur ek larko ke sat sex karke films  banata hai. Betiya to depression mei chali gayi but budhe ko fursat kaha.

I don&#39;t understand what she&#39;s trying to say,If she&#39;s is saying that she was outcasted and no support after aashiqui then when I had paused the video after it look almost 10-15 years later after her aashiqui movie then why she came to kapil sharma show,and meeted shit bhatt after this much, She&#39;s playing feminism or victim card,if she was really very angry about this shit industry then why she was present in kapil sharma show,for just like common people 500 rupees she was present there

Anu ji - you are a real star for us n we adore you for boldness and strength, exhibiting the true potential as a human being, this what matters and inspire people.   My brother in law who studied in hindu collage talked abt your transformation n hearing from him abt you is like a human revolution.

You are actually a diva, that&#39;s proves you are still very simple mind and lived a silent life far from world. All women should learn little bit from you especially Cheater Chakraborty

Being Haiwaan
Mahesh Bhatt is a traitor
I am so sorry for what Anu had lived through. Anu , I wish you all the healing energies. thanks to social media, I always wondered what happened to her but never knew.

How can Anu look so different as she aged

Sad  I knew from long time that this controversy was happening... There were  patterns in the murder.. even simple people understood..but this evil minds closes case

Maheshwa Bhattawa would not have done it.
Anu Aggarwal at that time was most beautiful sad that bollywood cud not give her the good opportunity... Bollywood crush talents not uphold or develop it if she hadvbeen in Us she cud have been great model as Naomi Campbell tooo bad for india

Greedy gulper

This Anu Agarwal ruined her in such a way that no one remembers her, she remained blank for 20 years and was sexually abused, her success in making targets was ruined and she became a victim of exploitation at the hands of Mahesh Bhatt. She was not even aware of what had happened to her, but today her face showed that now she has a wrong life style, alcohol, cigarette, everything, she has become a clever woman.. How long has that innocence of her innocent face gone? The brave woman has taken care of herself and she is still alive like a lash, she has wiped away her sorrows and somehow she has run away from the painful memories of the past and in order to survive even today she has to cope with the situation that has ruined her face. At that time the main cover page was the most glamorous girl's look, I knew that it was Annu Agarwal.

# Boycott Bollywood 
Surprisingly Madhuri Dixit survived in this bollywood. How come, its a mystery

The Khan gang and Karan johar are the worst criminal. They should be arrested.

Please remove the music 

One out of lakhs are such honest ppl , like sush like her like parbin babi like jiah who were murdered

What works in Bollywood is chamchagiri...favours in kinda...drugs.. nepotism.. politics..power..D company..hawala ka Paisa.. selling porn.. and still audience made them billionaire... irony 

Boycott big boss..Salman's whole attitude will come down..
How beautiful was she .... but now she is more beautiful  and graceful both from outside and inside  ... love for u  ... stay blessed

Sab jagah likhte rho.... Extinct Bollywood. The universe will for sure accept our this request. 

Mumbai Muslim Bollywood mafia ne Anu Aggarwal ki life khatam karne ke liye accident karwaaya, but by some random freak of nature &amp; God&#39;s grace; she survived. Went into complete isolation for several years. And then re-emerged as a different person with tremendous exertion of will power. Perhaps SSR was murdered brutally because in case he survives by some random miracle of nature; he won&#39;t be able to walk again like before...this Bollywood! A place of cruel-hearted petty dictators. And this Muslim by birth, Hindu by name Mahesh Bhatt. He gives new young actresses &quot;break&quot; in films; and then exploits them...and if they oppose/resent exploitation; asks the mafia to eliminate her. Mahesh Bhatt is really bedfellows with the mafia...and this man needs to be punished by hammer and tongs before he goes up..

Are you there?
Mahesh bhatt murdered her

You aint no american old mama

She has good talent  but it&#39;s wasted by unnatural circumstances !

That back ground score is irritating as hell..

Why dosent sumone kill Aslam Bhatt?? He has killed so many.

Who says Indians are white they must be colour blind all INDIANS where ever they live maybe some of them are a BIT lighter skin but WHITE PEOPLE will Still say you are an INDIAN who are these LOW DOWN people who say all these things to their own country woman or men Cannot understand what is going on in India

She looks crazy from Shakal and Bol. Are you taking drugs?
Yes. Anu. Maam.. u r right... Salute you...
yea true u wouldve survived surely u wldve gon..lucky bt went to coma is pathetic i think u went by dru someone wldve ..so crimin indust.dont they think of wome is that so pathetic beyond religio.,god.

Kick out Salman from Bollywood..that&#39;s not a big issue..public power can bring ups and downs

Anu we missed you for a long time today I saw you and feel good n blessed.God blessed you

Buddhhee bollywood wale young talent per jalte hai.

God bless you Anu. We don&#39;t carry name and fame  or wealth property but whatever we do good or bad that is karma. Karma follows us every birth and the soul has to bear the consequences.

She was a vry poor actor ,that is definite

Hw cud u tolerate that buddha?

She was too hot..I really like her even now. So sad she faced so much ! Bless her

After watching this video I don&#39;t know why this thought came to my mind that you should become an international life coach and help people also can earn a healthy amount.  Give a thought on this and if interested can help you to become a coach.Thanks

Whoever being famous overnight Bollywood did same with them. Divya bharti, Jiah Khan and so on same story repeated over the years .

She looked extremely hot and stunning.

They hate brown but they pretend to love black. Black lives matter, brown lives don&#39;t ??

Please boycott khan JOHAR bhatt Big boss Bollywood.

She looks very different now OMG can&#39;t believe

Justice for sushant singh rajpot.. 
Love you mam
Mahesh Bhatt womaniser should be grilled by CBI too

She was good actresses

She doesn&#39;t look like a normal girl..sorry

Seeing this lady after a long time. Ashiqui was a lovely movie. Whoever the producer or else. And the songs of the movie

I truly believe in KARMA. These idiots may laugh it off right now thinking that they are way too powerful and can afford to buy anything available on this planet but believe me, their immediate family will have to pay for their misdeeds. We are answerable to each and every actions.........in our life at regular intervals we get chances to repent but when we ignore and move forward with our sins, it gets logged in his book where we will be answerable to it.....NO matter how powerful you are right now, one day u will become history. Ur legacy will pay for ur misdeeds. Anu mam, you are still so beautiful and thank you for being open to us about these retards in the industry.

Bloody  karan johar. Neither he is a man nor a woman what he talking about. When this universe was made it produced a man and a woman for further productions. It produced Adam and eve. Not steve and steve I meaning to say it didnt only created man and man.

From 1990’s to 20’s no change for outsider nepotism culture banned n erase from Bollywood see the future of Congress we want to see non filmy actors rooted with Indian values

U still very beutiful... no matter what is ur skin colour ️

Pls keep speaking nd bring all skeletons ot

Hatred for Salman is increasing. That's why Johar &amp; Salman ur finshed. We must eliminate them completely. So that this doesn't happen to anyone else.

He planned to kill her but she’s lucky to survive: but ruining her life

Whichever boy or girl rejects Mahesh Bhatt for a movie, there is news of his death or accident. Or there is news of his death due to depression.
She sounds delusional

BAP-BETA DANB SE VI HIN HE RANGA BILLA party Sibsena Baliwood Mumbai Police criminals THOKAI HOGA CBI ED NIA
I think Mahesh Bhatt has engaged people to kill you in an accident but God wants you to be alive. It&#39;s time now to talk and eliminate bollywood mafia. So, please expose bollywood mafia.

Indians are not black but brown skinned (different shades). Please do not stereotype about skin colour.

Anu she is beautiful and good

She.was so pretty feeling sad for her

Hi, wanna call u in my prog based on racism

Whose friend does this Buddha live?
Bollywood ppl are enjoying their life of ordinary people money but bollywood tread them with so hate

Brother, it is Mahesh Bhatt's hand in his accident or suicide (Bollywood) I am worried that this old man should be fully investigated.
Anu was also a target. They plan to kill her too.

She was a dusky beauty ...

How SRK survived in  this industry , he is an outsider actor why did they let him become a star ?

salman the white girl ambassador of bollywood

True....This is what happened to some hard working outsiders. I think media should support her

Anu Aggarwal is sounding very strangely and she has so much make up it&#39;s a shame!

I&#39;m NOT black but light browned in colour and I love my complexion!

Ma’am be strong we’re with u!!!

Maybe you would have been blind to Bollywood hypocrisy if you had been more successful..so maybe a good thing

Will have caused an accident
Wasn&#39;t mahesh bhatt ur godfather?U were wrapped around him like an unrelenting ivy!! 
keep it up anu. you are an inspiration! god bless you!

They gave you the wrong roles...but i can tell you...your performance was so genuine that I still remember the innocent anu...

I have to tell you that both you and rahul were a perfect couple but unfortunately these people speak in the name of the public

Aashiqui was beautiful you had an innocence in your face that could make anyone jealous

Dear Anu..I watched your films and when I saw how they distributed a talented girl like you servant roles I knew that this is the way they say go where you come from...

Mahesh bath did not cause accident
God bless you

She is still very beautiful woman

Gunda raj is going on in bollywood
Mahesh Bhatt himself lunched her without her intrest on movies and later destroyed her career. And her accident wasn&#39;t natural. Lot&#39;s of love to you ma&#39;am 

What have you said to yourself?
Karan johar, alia bhatt, salman khan, shahrukh khan, Shahid Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Sonakshi Sinha, Sonam Kapoor, ekta kapoor etc. Boycott off All these types bollywood actors n also bigg boss n kapil sharma show ka bhi boycott kro Kyuki producer salman khan hai

Is she retorted or what? Are you saying this or whose story are you listening to? Ise abaa sing thy firangiyu k pas ya amaa sing thi? When I look after my penis, I log in...

Yesterday only I was watching her song koncham nilavu.....wat a song

If people’s eye wide open now after the death of Susant and during the lone period of Corona, they should watch underrated movies made by underrated actors, if the story and acting are deserving . Guys should not be overwhelmed by fake advertising or shows or rumours created to fool the audience. It’s time to wake up to judge a book by its real contribution, not by the cover.

Bollywood completely worst in condition. All indians can close this horrible underworld activites before going battle inside our country. Horrible connection with servant,police, politic, hospital doctors, drivers, pakistan etc., Then why protect our nation from Soldiers? Without this environment all indians can lead life. First step SSR then automatically there is a lot of suffers can get justice according to SSR taught of changes. CBI enquiry will give justice soon.

Childhood memories of Bollywood completely destroyed! The way things are going, I wouldn’t be surprised if the international media don’t notice what’s happening in India!

I guess the fairness creams need to be banned ...

Salman - Mahesh - have destroyed lives of many girls &amp; boys. Now it&#39;s time karma does the same.

Bollywood is going towards doomed world

Annu is an elegant actress

Jees  wtf stop the botox lady. U can not  even  lick your own lips?? LORD.

The narrative of this video is so so apt..it just shows this actress was way ahead of her era

Salman meri jaan ۛ i love you today, tomorrow or forever
Thank u maam for telling about bolly wood by maanika manjul  manju shree

I hate bollywood industry

U r sooo Preety noww

True lines, live life your own way, don't think about what people will say.Superb lines
Yes yeah you  were never that popular . And didn’t know how to act dear

Anu i admired u den n now i admire evn mo n respect u alot.
Kahan bola accident karaya gaya??rubbish !!She said she took a breakShe said it was abt color of her skin..

After the entry of these 3 khans the hindi cine industry has turned to its present sorry state. Time to stop patronizing these viruses and their sidekicks.

Tamanna Bhatia 

Her lips hv changed...i think its a plastic surgery failure....

Sushant&#39;s death is a murder not suicide...

Anu you are amazing now and then.I love your movie Ashiqui and if remains as my most favorite  movie of all times.I send you my love from America and wish for you all the best in life with God&#39;s blessings⚘

Rhea chakrabarti karan johar salman khan mahesh bhatt kills sushant singh rajput 
Hindi me bolti to bohut atsha lagta
I believe every word this lady saying....I never liked Mahesh bhat, salman Aliya types fake famous people after money n sex, n murder!!!

Really I love an I&#39;m huje fan of her

Beautiful actree

Boycott Salman Mahesh Bhatt and Karan johar

Boycot Salman Khan And Karan Johar

What kind of words are you saying...so banatipan
Farming s better option for Salman

Anu Aggarwal, honestly was the sweetheart of all when Aashiqui was released. I remember the songs and the movie was such a big hit. She was so beautiful that I admit I used to have a big poster of her in my room. Today dumb bitches like Sonam, Swara, Kareena, Alia etc. have nothing compared to heroines of those days.

There shud b a movie made on you ma&#39;am.  Because it&#39;s quite a mystery. We would like to see .

What happened to this glamorous actress she became so old i think she was paralized

Today i hate Salman khan And karan johar ...
competly ban whole bollywood

Omg I love her movies song ashqui she looks so innocent in those songs

Awesome Anu  keep going strong
she was damn pretty actress

oh 90s era....... feels like im in 90s lookin at her.....after ages ....

Nepotism is everywhere....not just in your Bollywood...you cant do shit about it. Let&#39;s say you work at a company and a job opens up, and you bring your friend or your relative to take that job (cause c&#39;mon, face it, we all would do that): that&#39;s also nepotism, ta daaaaa! (you denied the job to a total outsider, in case i have to explain it)

<a href="">#zubitips</a>
Black truth of Bollywood 

There is retail going on.
Salman ,karan n bhatts
Please stop watching  salmans shows n kapil Sharma show is his .. I think we should  ban this too

Anu ji You are a very beautiful woman. When i saw Ashiqui i was a very little Kid but was completely attracted towards you and became your fan. I Still see your songs nothing compares to that precious look and skin tone you have that time. Its like Oh my god !! She can just kill with looks.

If u speak in hindi rather than barking in english...i think more than 85% people in indian can better understand about what r u talking......

You are so gorgeous even look at yourself still u r looking very beautiful..what dark skin they were talking they are just racist that&#39;s all we can say...u are beautiful inside outMoreover I can say u r a eye opener for all of us ..thanx for sharing this video

Thank u mam
Hats off to you girl that you survived , you fought.

dint u sleep with every x yz for the role ..kum on miss white...

She has a brighter chance to come back in movies. Face change in one life. Good for her. Use it.

Boycott all films of mahesh bhatt,Salman,amir,shahrukh,ekta kapoor ,swara bhaskar

Nice <a href="">#gypsymusafir113</a>

yaar humlog hi inki movies ko dekh kar inay stars bnate hay..Hum  public hi inko rich bnati hay...jab bhi koi movie aye inki cinema mat jayo totally boycott kro in logo ko..Salman khan jo baap bna huya hay is industrt ka...sab isko unfollow kro or inko inki aukat dikhayo ki hmari wjah se inka wajood hay...Mahesh bhatt to pehle parveen bobby ko depression mai btaya fer jiya ko fer kangna ko ab sushant ko...even his own daughter is suffering from depression.. jab 11 saal ki thi tab se....Kangna aisi bold nd brave hay jo sab ki sachayi la rahi hay sahmne...

I hate all of them who is responsible for sushant death  miss you sushant

Hate bollywood... Justice for all victims
I like her her English is o my god

Don&#39;t judge people who are severely depressed and take their lives... R. I. P Sushant

Justin for Sushant Singh Rajput . police kyu Nahi btaee last night Sushant kis k sath party Kr rha tha

She looks so pretty ho skti thi bt ugly hai 

Mahesh bhatt used this girl.he used parveen n thru her like door Matt.  Look at these girls conditions. How he made statement like sushant was on footsteps  of parveen  so he knew what he has given to these 2 girls. N he must had given same things to sushant

Omg black skinned . It&#39;s true many people don&#39;t accept black skin. It was a part of culture and society since long time . Now it has become toxic enough to make racism and racism started killing people . Change shud start from us . Opt always for good heart people not white skinned people .

Bollywood is corrupt that&#39;s why i can&#39;t sing in India. But oneday i will rock the place where my brother Susant was born. I am coming soooon to India to just sing for Susant Singh Rajput. Cause i can&#39;t stop crying until i sing where he was born.

<a href="">#boycott</a> <a href="">#Bollywood</a> <a href="">#Karan</a> <a href="">#Salman</a> Ekta and all the <a href="">#Star</a> kids

I don't belong to English society but I feel that you are saying little about Bollywood.
Aashiqui was one of my favorite movies from when I was a teen in the 90’s.

What would I say in Hindi, ma'am, if I spoke to you, I would feel better. Bhi smjh aajt
Bollywood family trying to monopolize the industries and saving it fot their own kids futurw that s why don&#39;t let others to come in real talent are push away. Don&#39;t watch their movie don&#39;t support such a industries that is filthy and dirty.

She didn&#39;t say anything about her accident

They try to destroy priyanka career but lucky her she get success at Hollywood&#39;s now this mafia can&#39;t do anything to her

Each life has a story, best of luck, God bless you

<a href="">

She too was a nobody and when she beat all records they decided to kill her. Not a single person in Bollywood tried to help her or find out about her neither her director nor her co actor. It&#39;s possible they might have tried to murder her but she survived and she is here back with a bang. Her whole life got ruined she had nobody.

Skin color . Cheap mentality. People s heart and intention that count not skin color. The body turns into ashes after death my dear friends. Have wisdom. Anuji you are very pretty.

Bollywood before I feel like dream and beautiful but now Bollywood is like dirty politics so sad 

I hate Bollywood. Karan, and his team

Hope god brings down the hell on earth the bollywood

Kitne

Salam khan n mahesh bhatt bloody basterds
Did she talk bout salman?

Oh my god. Can&#39;t even recognise her. God bless her tc

She strange and weird 

Because you had attitude problem at that time

She&#39;s beautiful but must do something to her eyes brows.

Ohh my godd... She looks so different ..

Say Hindi, why don't you say Hindi because you are 12 years old?
Salman, let's see what to do to everyone..
Hi

Abb Bollywood khatam ho gaSamaj lo rajput Bhai yo
She was a brilliant actress very pretty and she earned a lot of fame for her first movie aashique she was a super model dusky and gorgeous.. poor girl she faced a lot too like sushant.. thnk god she is safe now..

You will not be afraid to eat bakchodi here, at least before unfollowing instagram and facebook you log in.
Kangana you should join politics you have a good carrier in politics you have the courage

Good mam 
I love u mam  I&#39;m big fan of you

Is she a person who acted in thiruda thiruda movie in tamil..konjam nilavu..omg.

I&#39;ve stopped watching new Hindi films since last 5-6 years. Horrible movies. I do watch old Hindi classics, and they are so wonderful. There&#39;s a story line, a social message, wonderful mature actors. These days all you get is 10 songs with seriously deformed lyrics, and watch half naked actresses, with only made up beauty, and no talent other than showing off their bodies. Not watching Karan Johar&#39;s films anymore. He puts out only the garbage. Few movies in the beginning were ok.

Anu ji, you&#39;re very beautiful inside and out. Do not bow down to anyone except to God. He will take care of you, and watch over you.

Why you have not done plastic surgery

I always thought she was hot and i lived her eyes!

What has she done to me...how strange is this...how beautiful is this?
What a weird woman

You go girl thanks for sharing your story very inspiring. All the best

Salman is afraid that someone else would overshadow him. Someone younger and better looking. He is so insecure. This is why he tries to keep talented, good looking actors under his feet. Salman is worried he is getting old, fat and ugly.

She&#39;s talking about what?

Salman khan is a very hot actor
Hi Anu. Jo acting aashqui main ki thi aapne vaisi acting koi aur kar hi ahi sakta.tha. you are very pretty. Dont worry about people. Dont forget that aashqui was a trendsetter movie. I love songs of aashqui simply superb

She is so true...boycott this khan n Karan movi

Reality is coming out now..

It’s not about Bollywood even some ppl around are so cheap ..they calculate beauty with color.. I hate  kind of ppl who judge beauty in color..and also in marriage Proposals ppl what only white skin girl no matter she is Characterless or bad person  they call them has beauty and marry them..those nonsense ppl who   Never give importance to drk ppl they call them they are not beautiful..how  so foolish are  those ppl who are cheap and give only  important to color..who the hell has given them that right to judge beauty  in color

She was such a beautiful  doll ..pretty  heroine

All know about karan

Spirituality is life so development

I am a big fan of you mam....really nice to see you....Aashiqui 1 movie and songs....my favorite movie......Love you

OMG look what age can do to u :(

Sushant won&#39;t commit suicide. It&#39;s a murder. We miss you Sushant. The police in Mumbai is scared of dirty bollywood

She was incoherent in her thoughts!

So true thank uYou God blessings

She is out of the industry for ages now.Why is is now speaking so dramatic..??..Now..

Inlogo ko hindi bolne main itna sharam or hichkichahat kiu hai??..

She was also launched by Mahesh Bhatta. Something fishy every actors and actresses he launched have something mysteriously bad things happened.

Rip salman khan n karan johar mahesh bhatt
feels like she had coke.

Now this is the right time to change the host of (Bigg Boss14) we don&#39;t want to see Salman as a host..........

CBIINQUIRY for our beloved sushant Singh Rajput..unka murder hua hai ..aisha bahut logo ke sath hua hai

And got a proof, what else is needed.
Annu , we know you , studied together at Hindu College | You are a brave heart  love you n stay strong 

OTT is the future of movie releases. Once we stop watching the filthy sub-standard Karan, Salman &amp; Alia kind of movies and encourage real talent like Ayushmann, Vicky, Kangana,Vidyut etc, all these uneducated &amp; foolish so called ‘stars’ have to go home packing

She&#39;s still beautiful not like others actress who does plastic surgery n whitening skin

We are with you mam

Omgggg

Do support outsiders Ayushmann,Vicky Kaushal, Vidyut Jamwal,Raj Kumar Rao,Amit Sadh,Bhumi Pednekar and Nawazuddin siddiqui

Bollywood to tatti nikli sabhi khul khul kar bol rahe hai tatti hai

In white total kiara advani
Madum you are so brave, how you survived and managed difficult situations is highly appreciable.

Behn he didn&#39;t sucied,he has been killed

We boycott Bollywood you Indian&#39;s should too

Stay happy and blessed

Bhosadi's Kagwan said that he had caused an accident to the boy... he had worn out the chappal and put a wrong thumb nail on it.
But the salmon boy has done charity
Most of the Indians realize the facts at the time when it is very critical.

Miss u SSR...
Sushant's regret is that ALLAH is just, Aameen, how lovely a human being is in this cruel world.
I hate all the KHAN&#39;S bull Dogs

Anuji ur so beautiful 
Its better to be on your break even <a href="">now.No</a> charm left.

Know how many lives have been destroyed in Bollywood  Now is the time to destroy Bollywood  boycott Bollywood 
You are still so beautiful maam

Everyone's favorite sadist is Mahesh Bhatt.
Salman Khan promoted nepotism way more than Karan Johar, and yet nobody is blaming him. Bhai hone ke fayde....

Buycott bollywood they all are criminals...

Guys we should stop to watch all movies and shows like big Boss of Salman khan.

Everyone is talking rubbish about salman khan so here i request all of u to plz show me some evidence and truth that salman is the reason for shushant&#39;s suicide and if u don&#39;t have reason so plz don&#39;t blame him and his suicide is his own choice and may be some other reasons happen but still if u guys want to blame others then first of all blame yourself for not being a true fan jb shushant sir itne din se TV m nhi dikhte the to tmlog kyun nhi aye unke support m unke agar suicide k bad hi tmlog sbko support aur pyar doge to half bollywood to suicide krne lagenge so jo jinda h unke lye ab fight karo aur unhe unki jagah dilao na ki kisi ko blame kr k

Inki to bf bhi dekhi 
Anu ji we believe in your words
This is a very dangerous Buddha. He has spoiled the lives of many people. Jiya Khan, what is his age? 16 years. This Buddha has not stopped showing his anger even on him. Ban this Buddha and his daughters quickly, otherwise they will kill so many people. This bhatt kandi family
You ain’t making any sense

Exactly life is God given and no one has a right to end it.We must wrestle with the enemy until he’s defeated looking at our endurance.

Please  arrest that budda .....

Boycott salman khan
How terrible this looks!
anyone noticing the number of face surgeries she&#39;s gone thru?

As she&#39;s aged she&#39;s looking more like a man

Fact :- first love name is always our passwordDo chk my channel and ur support appreciated.

These lark's legs are here 
she is our fav

Thts truuu..coz aftr ashqi u wer superrr hit and hot..most beautifullll actress..

Dark indrusty
Main culprit is Bhatt family..

Pointless words.... just siding problms buy focusing on styling video making... evryone knows .. problms occurs on eachone of us

Ghatia buddhaa harami sala Mahesh  bhatt

Let us change our bollywood from nepotism n boycott the gang like Mr.Bhatt n Karan johar n also like Salman khan bhaya ji haha

Why she seems psycho

Your accident was not an accident it was a pre planned way to get rid of you with a closed case, but it went wrong when God decided you need to survive that , even your doctor that said u have 6 months assisted you coz the mafia backed of from killing you in hospital coz they thought you would be gone soon.Yet you survived and I think it&#39;s coz you needed to expose them and bring justice to <a href="">#SushantSinghRajput</a>

Love u Anu ma&#39;am .. Boycott bollywood.. Only support to outsider Straggler actors....

We HV to follow the below thumb rules..1. ban any movie produced/directed by Karan jahar where the actors are from any Nepo family / star kids..simply boycott them 2. Only watch films by him where actors are from non Nepo family and   non star kids..

Dil Bechara is the last Hindi movie that we will watch. Fell in love with Bollywood. Respect and love for you mam<a href="">#SSRCaseIsNotSuicide</a> 🇮🇳Insaaf milna hi hoga. There is respect for those actors and actresses who have committed injustice and demand justice. If RIP Sushant sir gets justice he will get the chain.
She was so beautiful 

It&#39;s disgusting that people are still discriminated based on their colour in India. Being dark does not make you unattractive.

Tap the like button to smash karan a million times:....

Meaning whoever wrote the dialogues of Sultan movie was an honest person. Salman really turned out to be a shit guy 
Now everyone is remembering that I have started eating all this to divert the mind from Sushant ji's side so we all are his servants, tell them everything but please pay attention but sorry only justice Sushant sir.
She still  look beautiful , i love her english accent , much better than other bollywood stars

<a href="">#BOYCOTT</a>  EVERYONE  THE  POWERFUL  <a href="">#CRIMINALS</a>&#39;S  RUBBISH  <a href="">#BOLLYWOOD</a>  <a href="">#FILMS</a>

Ya bosdika Salman, yrf, Ekta, Sajid ya sab toh mohra hai is the real khiladi of the Ganda game toh Dubai Mai Mai hai hai
I knew it! I had very strongly felt it

Mahesh Bhatt is a sex maniac. He can marry Alya if he wants to.
Oh God how much lg rhi h y

We want CBI enquiry

Is she a american? Looks  n  way of talking is like foreigner

 BOLLYWOOD MAFIYA'S GANG HAI....KAMINA HAI SAB STAR KID AB Nahi Chale Ga Tumra Mafiyo
Poor lady came back from the clutches of death literally n survived

Fuck Salman madarchod and Karan chutiya

I don&#39;t know much about you but I&#39;m just curious when you talk your mouth will fall down no bad intention

Hi! Welcome.. Nice to see you after long time . And hear all. Whatever you said was right. But I hope you had met Earlier Sushant Singh Rajput.  Then he could have not done as people say Suscide?? As he been so Educative and only one year Left to complete his Engineering.  Sushant could have Switch his Brain signal back to Engineering. Well like you mention earlier what you did after your Accident.  But this time you have not Mention Mahesh Bhatt  team of your Success in Movie  Aashique  Why! Did you also get same treatment like Kangana Ranaut  get??? Please Answer now is the time to speak up!London.13-07-2020.

Richa Chaddha look like her
She looks like a man

You are really great ma&#39;am

Dirty bollywood shameful

c was really beautiful..but Bollywood kicked her out too

Boycott boliwood

Before knowing about your accident i was missing u a lot

My god how they are doing on girls coming from outside .....they must be exposed now

They murdered SSR manager 1st because if would have killed SSR 1st Disha would have told everyone everything

Omg..what has happened to her??so sad..

I’m sorry, but she sounds like she’s high on dope. But I do remember watching couple of her movies growing up in the 90s. She has potential for acting.

You did not tell anyone why, Ekmatra Kangana raised the voice of nepotism in front of others.

Appreciate you sharing your views. But expose the names  as well to save others. Sushant didn&#39;t take his life. He was murdered. We need justice for Sushant. Please voice for him. Thanks.

Bipasha is gorgeous

Very good

Shame on Alia Bhatt father going after young girls, daughter n father have shame ,what will people think,one side alia against Sushant,other side father flirting with Sushant girl ,really ashame to see how old man with young girl

All need to be investigated and put them in jail as it is happening in USA

I hated SRK, SALMAN AND KARAN AND MAHESH BHATT, SOONAM KAPOOR and more

More truth and sexual abuses will be explored and come  out.  They will be nailed

Her talking style is not good .

Love you mam. Miss you
Still gorgeous!
Can&#39;t hear her over the music

Why is she talking like a psycho..no sar pair..she has lost it!!

What has she done to her face..her fillers shows ugly..chill girls..u r not even able to talk proper..why does she take out tongue while talking..eeewee

What does this video have to do with the title you&#39;ve given? You are just trying to hog views by misleading people. Cheat!

At least don&#39;t attend their first day first show

Hats off to her for her sublime, sensuous role in a big banner movie like &quot;Khalnaika&quot;. That&#39;s one of the best movies of all time...

U are a brave lady ️

Haan Mahesh Bhatt me hi Inka accident karwaya <a href="">tha.jo</a> Ye aa gayi to death.
Mahesh Bhatt produced Murder movie acted by Emran Hasmir that promoted CHEATING. Shows his true character.

Why did u put music it is not clear what is been said

It&#39;s a reality btown is filled with filthy basterds

Let&#39;s take a pledge, to not watch any star kids movie,karan johar movies or any of his production,nepo kids . But let&#39;s watch only struggler&#39;s movie , outsiders with real talent.

Bhatt booht bekar hai
Achaa kia Bollywood chood dea take care Anu

She was damn gorgeous wen young!

I guess people are still blind to see what dark side does Bollywood have. Jab SSR nahi bol paya toh people were questioning his murder mystery. Watch this and tell me what that poor guy must have gone through.

Bollywood is being controlled by Pakistan and Dubai and for that a friend star has been hired who operates as if any police officer makes phone calls from Dubai...a parallel gang is running...the underworld has started its operations. Has kept weapons and is also a jihadi
Anu I know you very well  if you remember me I had came to your house in worli

When did you came back from aashram

Mam you are not dark you just a beautiful person

Mahesh Bhatt will soon burn his butt ..he will go to hell ...karma doesn&#39;t spare anyone

God bless you

She has a posh accent.

Sushant's manager Jan said that Sushant Singh will be killed so Disha will be killed first then Sushant, this is not suicide, it is 100% murder.
Spot on
Now all the motherfuckers are coming out of the blue, all are drunk, they have created a drama of the death of an actor... and by speaking in English they can understand the public, they will sympathize with you, you bitch, son of an Englishman.
Actually I think SSR know their dirty bollywood that&#39;s why they killed him.

If shes so easygoing about her colour ....and criticizing......why is she wearing loads of foundation to look fairer...strange!

MISLEADING TITLE

She looks like a gay ...

Why is she overreacting like that? Look at her body language 

The DON of Bollywood (Salman khan) n the Nepo father of Bollywood ( KJO) both should be put in jail along with Rhea, her brother, Mahesh Bhatt ( the master mind)  Shame on all of them....they will have to suffer a huge time!!!

Very beautiful woman!

If you watch sadak2 even then you are a moron. We need to prove our power as audience. Please let&#39;s stick together and make our points. Please please Baad me dekh lena tv pe. Not now.

Anyone who saw Sadak 2 has forgotten Sushant. Not watching on TV right now.
i really don&#39;t thing she is annu..

Why is she talking like she&#39;s trying to seduce someone

Puri changed ho gayi he ye to
Dirty bolly....

justice for SSR

I agree what you say...life is precious for each one of us. One shud not give up easily and Sushant was forced to go this way. Life is a miracle

Anu , really appreciate you being strong. Keep it up. You are in every way beautiful today also. The great work your doing nobody will think of the same .God bless you happiness and good health always.

Hey little one
Mahesh bhatt the psycho

What a learned and lovely woman who is at a different level altogether.. Spirituality is the key....To look inwards is all that matters... Sushant could have done the same... He could have fought these battles which all outsiders face and could have even been in touch with people who were not from the industry to gain insights and become a stronger individual....Shes so right when she says that we have no right to take our lives... If things dont work out, take a different path....look at her... Shes an inspiration and been through so much....and the hope and peace that shows her inner reflection is something to look upto....especially for a person who tragically lost her looks in a near fatal accident.....and in an industry which doesnt look beyond looks....... How she turned it to something good.... May God bless you Anu with happiness and success.....

You look so beautiful 
Anu Agarwal is an honest person.Bollywood is a dirty place.

Ban Him Soon from the Bollywood Industry  <a href="">#BoycottMaheshBhatt</a>

Inka b accident krwa dia gya... Because she was awesome.. And people were jealous of her... Thank God she is alive.. She can say out openly about everything but this is the truth.

Inka b accident krwa dia gya... Because she was awesome.. And people were jealous of her... Thank God she is alive.. She can say out openly about everything but this is the truth.

Yar ku krty ho esa kya kasor tha shushant ka .

She was so beautiful in her young days...

Thank you Ana
Boycott kareena, sonam, Ali&#39;s, karan ,salman etc
Sushant was not an actor alone so tat wen bwood boycott him he cant survive..he s an artist n scholar n hardworking n easy learner so he can survive in any situation than a nepo kid cos he was from middle class too so  he cant suicide anyhow so pls ind gov help him getin justice

simple solution to all this bollywood industry madness  = completely stop watchinf their damn movies

Anu had a wonderful style and grace.....Stupid people.talking about color...

She&#39;s a beautiful soul ️

I think people who r actually  shown as villian in d movies r real heroes n people who hv heroic image r real villian of d bollywood as well as society....then what&#39;s d profit of earning good image by playing goodie woodie roles.

Oh all it shows how filthy place bollywood is...gutter is less to say

So many bad and dirty ppl in Bollywood  industry.

Now she remembered all these.  After two decades... 

Yeah, even some educated Indian guys too care about skin color rather than the accomplishments that the girl has. I am glad my mind has come out of the stress of what people think. Sick, judgemental people. It’s really sad that girls especially have to suffer more in Indian society where parents also sometimes think more about “vo chaar log,” and not for their child’s happiness. I don’t know why we are always told to compromise rather being confident and self sufficient.

I have always admired or hated watching these Khans and kids stars…Karan Johar Bhatt and Yashraj and all Bollywood…I have never watched Movies…
She looks so clumsy and ugly

I don’t think so she is Anu

I hate.. fake.bad indian stars.

I JUST VOMITING AFTER SEEING THIS PERSON

YUK YUK YUK SHE LOOKS LIKE A MAN

EWW ANU LOOKS SOO DAMN UGLY AND SCARY FOR GODS SAKE GET OFF THE SCREEN I WILL PAY YOU TO

Anu Agarwal was most sexiest actress during 90&#39;s...

All crimes lead to Mahesh Bhatt camp....

yes i agree karan and salman but dont forget the people that never acknowledged him like alia tiger ranbir ranveer akshay ajay varun aamir they all where jeouls of off sushant and never once acknowledged him

Bollywood is such a shame to India 
We shouldn’t trust cbi to do anything because the famous actors can buy police then they can buy cbi the only change we can make is FROM US WE NEED TO STOP WATCHING MOIVES STOP TREATING CELEBS LIKE GOD AND RESPECT REAL TALENT

Gosh she was stunning! Still is

Good English......
She was such a gorgeous woman and she still is but it&#39;s sad to learn what all happened to her.

Good on her for speaking up

Mahesh.bhatt is behind her accident..he killed Parveen bhabhi..

Please all boycott bollywood mafia koi bhibinka movies mat dekho please 

i don&#39;t like her accent.

Boycott Mahesh bhatt films.alia bhatt,salman khan,karan johar,sonam kapoor
Yar sach btaun toh ye jis tareeke se bol ri h itna cringy lag ra h na  in black dress she was just doing overacting I don&#39;t know why

Jaha jaha Bhatt’s ka , Salman Khan ka naam aata hai, murders and crimes are just synonymous

People in this country do good things like being kind,helping others ,needy people just to hide their worst part of life. Never trust anyone.

She is very brave lady

Anu I know ur msg is more imp but I love how uv aged, beautiful and spiritually victorious.

Horrible

She was a star... It is sad that Indian film industry lost such talented actress... We could not see her more movies...

Sab se jyada ghtiya mahesh bhatt hai....kamina tharki buddha

Bollywood is run by khan cabal.. Yash johar and yash Chopra can&#39;t do anything as they everyone loves lots of money which gives lavish lifestyle and power

God is great

People say that I did not adopt Bollywood, but those who did not adopt say that it is their father's Bollywood and the first person who wants to become a law should be educated and talented.
Not bol Li kro
True....

Stop blaming Salman for someone taking they own life there&#39;s always a choice also these people speaking now could have spoken before if they cared so much!!

The film industry all actors only look nice on SCREAN behind screans and really they are selfish, big-headed, arrogant who only think abt them selves!!

200 dislikes by Sallu Amir and Sharukh Khan ke chutiye fucking fans from mmahim and bandra

Wow  seeing her after so long, she was amazing in her first movie

Wao mam I like the way u speak.. Ur great admirer.

Boycott Bollywood

Don&#39;t come back coz no one is going to watch you and you will be too disappointed.

I support you Anu mam 
These things will never change until unless we change by boycotting there movies .thats called people power .ssr sacrifice shouldn&#39;t go in vein

&quot; the life was given as a gift&quot;( to much nice and inspiring word!..thank you mam...

I feel for you Anu and can understand what you must have been through, All i can do for you is hold you in my thoughts and prayers, God Bless.

Karan johar should soon be banned from bollywood


Yes---------like 
No ---------------------comments 
complextion discrimination aise country mein jahan par 85% people are brown dark color So what is the point of discrimination??? Obviously you are not foreigners so you suppose to have Brown or dusky skin tone so why having so much obsession about Gora complex?

Next ban bollywood nepotism terror

I wish all these people who have ruined the industry have never joined the industry and remained alive.
May God bless you , I feel your pain ! May you find justice !

Same happened with Tannu Shree Dutta but no one supported her.
To think that I actually liked  Salman khan ‍️
She wasn&#39;t depressed bt Bollywood made her stay behind close door by giving her a new face ..Bollywood took her identity from her Al da biggies of Bollywood she was so famous wid one movie ashiqui just imagine how far she cud have gone if dat accident was not planned against her ..ethng is planned in Bollywood it&#39;s more like underworld I wud say

Fake industry

I JUST LOVE ZEENAT AMAN and  PARVEEN BABI

Guys .. we the audience are also partially responsible for existing community. Today so many are feeling low due to Sushant&#39;s death and nepotism and what not.  Agar sab kuch normal hota ..then comments on those so called stars would be &quot; awwww.. kya body hai, 6 packs, bhai bhago bhai k movie h..1st day 1st show chahiye&quot;. What is the point in blaming these stars or starkids or anyone for the fact. Put your emotions in your thoughts, put your thoughts into action. Only then, you can find change ! Jai Hind..

They all say that if you don't spend your money watching these movies, you will make everyone rich.
Ban bhatt camp n all big banner
<a href="">

U know these bollywood mafia club movie should not be in Patna at all.

Sarkar ko pura bollywood ko boycott karna chaiye yaar..Kya fayda eisi gandagi ki..chhee chhee...
Why didnt u people watched his movies when he begged. People also like bakwas n dirty movies

This case is cold blooded murder nothing else. Give and take is everywhere, like you scratch my back I scratch yours . This is all B S about nepotism. It exists in every aspects  of life. Heads off to this actress she is brave and she didn’t give up. I am pretty sure everyone is proud of her and she is not coward. Jai Hind

Too much powder n its too white ur beauty the wsy u r brownie

She met with an accident, even Mahima Chaudhary met with an accident, Divya Bharti was murdered or committed suicide.. Same is the case with Sushant.. all were outsiders and doing well..

Kal nayka brilliant movie. You are beutyful you are who you are.

I don&#39;t wanna see any bollywood films .. bollywood industry is disgusting 
Anu Agarwal is so pretty ....
Mam please justice for Sushant ...we all want CBI enquiry

Those who discriminate on the basis of complexion are most sick people.. for me you were and are very beautiful.. not so called fair like that two faced alia or other ridiculous people... Neither fair people have any good features and this is 100% true

Karan Johar is crazy...
People how much more proof do you need against these Nepotistic people of Bollywood.BOYCOTT them

Bollywood ma pakahai sex activities ka karobarr chalthai

Yes Mam...

Yes mem need to CBI justice

This is truth I don’t understand why they get jealous of each other why can’t be they happy for their happiness I just hate please kisi ki khushi mein  khush howa karo inshallah Allah day ga both Zeada ..

Anu ji Y this drama? Accent that doesnt pull off too well with U? Ur eyes look so drugged or tired. R U saying U didnt sleep with the big boys in the past to land an opportunity for urself? Been there done that eh! U R just an older version of Rhea now. U girls give em all they wanted then complain about them one fine day. Check ur own karma first.

Mahesh Bhatt and Rhea Chkrborty were killed like they killed Sushant. Salman Karan and many stars are boycotting everyone... Get C.B.I checked.
Ok

CBI INQUIRY

Annu….What are you saying? It is true that Bollywood is a complete disaster….Stop watching dog movies and ruin your hard work.
What is that irritating background music

Boycott Karan johar n salman movies
Great life, I am sure God is a able to bring beauty out of ashes.God bless you.

He's not the first one to come in front of me.. a man has come to eat Jane's bad dick.
Listen to the music or talk to you, what is your intention, make a log video to take it out in this field, there should be a community for the video.
I don't know how much life is worth it...
This is the real face of bollywood...... Pathetic even in 2020&#39;s it&#39;s happening... Can&#39;t believe

Mahesh butt is Evil, and this Actress should shut up , we humans don&#39;t want to listen to your story, just tell the truth about evil of Mahesh butt.In 1989 You came to Bollywood and after what happens,  you came back to the world again ; because you have to speak the truth about evil Heart people, you are hiding evil inside mahesh bhatt,  you  change the story to change humans mind. People are not fool , you and mahesh bhatt in same evil world. It is the evil plans of murder of Sushant singh. May the soul of Sushant singh RIP.

So why did Mahima Chaudhary also have an accident, because at that time she was also at her high peak, most of the movies passed her.
The underworld......most likely are the culprits.......&amp; people still having connection with them are the perpetrators......most likely,.....wish C.B..I....probes this angle more than anything else....people having links to the Mafia ,underworld ,to be precise must be shown no mercy......they must be imprisoned.....if the government can go after corruption ,non tax payers do seriously ,why are&#39;nt they going after the underworld.....something fishy about Indian politics.....the polititions most likely have underworld links themselves.....the Indian citizens must look at this angle &amp; be alert to such polititions.....!!!!!Such polititions must be imprisoned!

No one likes you

everyone relate somewhere with mahesh bhatt had to pay price ... which doesnt seems coincidence at all ....

Sooo cute n talented actress of that period.

Some of her words made me cry.

Glad she spoke up. Very brave of her.

Don&#39;t come anyone mallu wood, no chance ok, full here ok ok

What is it that keeps kissing someone?
Gunda Bhatt

Boycott these idiots who did this let them get a taste of their own medicine karma going to bite them in their arse

Such a beauty! Always back then and today! MashaAllah

Guys, not only Salman khan and Karan, don&#39;t forget Shahrukh khan how he treated Sushant at an ifa event or so, he made fun of him.. Boycott Sharukh khan too!

Koi jana mana actor ki sucite, murder at young age m kyu nai hota ....why only out sider did this.... harasment

Very sad 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yes they hate dark skin because their brain is not functioning right ,look at salman khan and arbaz khan who both have foreign girlfriend with sooo fair skin and iulia had even blond hair ...

Needs justice for ssr. Boycott Bollywood

What condition has nepotism created for the poor girl? Yet she remained alive, otherwise she would have died.
Yes muder muder muder  muder please justice sushant sir

U look like richa chadda
Verar ka Chokra ..Govinda is the multi talented perfect complete hero who has been giving the movie release for many years, toh screen na ke bar dete hai producer' Earlier, Nilhani had said a few years ago that some heroes are handicapped, they have to take the help of Eid, Diwali, Christmas to make their movie a hit and even now few people ask Govinda that if Govinda's movie is released. Then they will eat everyone when Govinda's AEG will be 55 but still his movie has not been released, they are plotting that this is the new hero who is coming forward on the basis of his talent, who will punish him???
ANU, God bless you a tonne

Very Sad

Dirty bollywood 
This is the reason I never watch movies, I always felt wasting my time watching movies

Bollywood Industry hands are full of murder blood.Bollywood is being cursed by public

We missed you mam
Thts when i used to wonder wr u have been there was no trace post those superhit movie mam....

She was so pretty 

Anu agrwal you are my fev thi

I hope this once beautiful actress is okay Why is she so dramatic Lady be yourself please So artificial

The level of any nation&#39;s mentality shows how ignorant they are still talking about SKIN COLOUR SERIOUSLY. Get a life there are so many things going on in this world. SUCH A SHAM. .From UK

Boycott bollywood

Watch only new struggling actors and actresses movies and boycatt all over others movies of dirty actors and actresses who have God fathers in bollywood

Bollywood is a hell for outsiders who have no godfather, whore house, full of nepotism...Hence boycott bollywood mafia gang...show them power of a common people

Salman khan is not dabang...he is a coward

Mahesh Bhatt has no idea what to do if you look at him, he is hugging some girl, he is kissing someone
We love you
Sushant Singh rajput  it&#39;s planned murder we want CBI investigation

Is this a woman or what kind of animal is this?
Karan aunty..Salmaan dogi...thuuuuuuuuuu
Love u

Thanks to Pandemic!

If salman prevails anymore in this industry there would be more suicides and murders. He has destroyed most of the lives and carries in the industry as well as outside.

Now what does it sound like in the language of heroin, we can understand from the way how it is happening.
The world is taught to sin. There is only one true God. I am not talking about dead people. I am talking about the truth.
dont know why but am finding her fake

Bollywood is now going to finsh

Sushant did not commit suicide but he was murdered.
Old pictur look like divya bharti

you are cute

thank god ibeen only watching Govindas moves ..Salman is mafia ov Bollywood..never enjoyed srk n Karen&#39;s moves....

He himself did not know what the pain was, drinking gave him the opportunity to reach the society.
But her talking style
Feeling so sad fr jiya Khan ,divyabharathi Sushant , May b many more we don’t knw wht actual story of many ppl in Bollywood 

All indians are brown skinned ,few of them are dark skinned.Mixed Indians are pale skinned,thats the truth.But we Indians are rediculously obsessed with pale ( white)skin.what an irony.

You are looking gorgeous

Even Salman ruined Vivek Oberoi...now vivek Oberoi is working down in south Indian movies...I had stopped watching Bollywood movie for last 10 years...only watching south Indian movies which is far better than Bollywood one....here only star kids r promoted....they even forget only becoz of we people the r star....all Indians should boycott Bollywood then only nepotism will come to an end.....

BLOODY NEPOTISM! THERE WAS THESE DOUBLE STANDARD&quot;S SOCIETY! SHE WAS A FABULOUS STAR! ANOTHER STORY OF BOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY THAT REVEAL&quot;S THE REALITY OF BOLLYWOOD! HOW BAD IS OUR INDUSTRY TO OUTSIDER&#39;S! NEWCOMERS FROM SMALL CITIES AND TOWNS. CRUELTY IS REALITY OF BOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY!

You are a beautiful lady forever mam keep it up
Ur a natural beauty diva

Mahesh bhat is bad director.He kiss to everybody.

Annu ur the best and ur movie was a hit

Mahesh Bhatt is womanizersHe destroy the outsider celebs life and career.

After some time you will see Bollywood people also working in call centers...if it continues like this
We also watched your Aashiqui movie in our childhood. It was a very hit movie of that time.
People plz stop taging salman for every thing salmam can be a bad ass sometimes but he has helped so many people financially  he gave work to so many unemployed please stop dragging his names everywhere shes talking about the industry&#39;s conspiracy which is going on from decades so stop fooling around and defaming salman

She&#39;s looking like dimple kapadia sister she beautiful lady loved  watching her in movie&#39;s so sorry to hear industry&#39;s conspiracy against talented people hope this all stops no more lives anymore please   

Kareena, how useless was this when I started acting, even though I got few chances, now see, I learned acting too.
Very unty

Mahesh Bhat &amp; Reha Chakrabarty r the killer..

Show Salman and Karan their status
Bodiii hona ka bd iska to taver e bdal gia ha

Even the gutter is ashamed in front of the filth of Bollywood <a href="">#CBIForSSR</a>
Sushanta singh&#39;s death case investigating officer is corrupted by nepotism gang. If it weren&#39;t for that then why the investigator doesn&#39;t make any interrogate with them.If Sushant&#39;s fans want justice then the Case need CBI Investigate

I miss you so much Sushant Singh Rajput.... RIP

Ye sab ke pichhe mahesh Bhatt ho sakta hai ...wo ek silent killer hai ...usski mansikta bann gayi hai achhe logo ko marwa daalta hai

We did not know until recently that Salman Khan is such a dirty guy.

Hii

She is talking like Pooja Mishra.

Mujhe Anu kafi achi lgi thi ..or dekhna chahti hu

I believe her definitely
Jastice for Sushant. CBI enquiry

Her acting was pathetic in ashique..the picture was hit only because of Kumar Sanu and Nadeem Shravan...Both hero and heroine were super duper flop show..She was lucky to be acting in a super hit film in bollywood..

Speak Hindi, I don't understand what you say on the log.
No matter how dark, fair , brown or black some is, no matter how handsome or beautiful someone is, at the end, you die with nothing and everything is burnt into ashes..It’s easy to judge others, wait until you get judged by the king of kings (Jesus)

What is this Hindi?
Best is to ban completely new movies of few people who has destroyed others’ lives and public is best media to punish them if they stick to their sentiments.

Bipasha was discriminated by kareena calling her black cat

Boycott bollywood mafia, Boycott Alia Bhatt, Karan Johar, Pooja Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor, Salman khan, Ekta Kapoor, Pooja Bhatt, Rhea Chakraborty, Sodumb Kapoor. We want justice for Sushanth Singh Rajput CBI inquiry requied 

My God...what a horrible industry!

Boycott Bollywood

First time watch you...I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s you

Best Punishment is to Boycott the Mafia Actors. This is the right Choice baby..... Because the Investigation will be going for years and years. If u r poor and u do crime u will be behind the Bars within 24 hrs. If u r Rich then u r investigation and case will run for years and years. And u can enjoy the life.

Now every is coming out talking about nepotism, maybe if they had the nerve to do something or say something He would have been alive .. shame Bollywood

bollywood is bad
The name of Bollywood is being spoiled for people like Salman and Karan. Now see, the age of poison is gone. Is it true that Salman is acting?

Salman was always bad. He got in trouble with law repeatedly but people simply overlooked it all because he was a superstar. Wake up people....don’t make someone your god just because he comes on tv. So what?

I am going to give you water in my hand.

I was scared after seeing aunty.
She used to be so beautiful.. what happened to her face and mouth now. I guess she went through cosmetic surgeries I think. Her face is so still can’t move her mouth properly.. it’s looking like plastic doll talking.. how old is she now? She looks much older than her age..

Ban salman khan movies in all states I hate him kachra mind dirty minds

Why you think he had done suicide it is murdered

Salman Khan has no need for any kind of path or hatred, what kind of place does he need to create?
Gheeeen aa rahi hai bollywood due to some scoundrels...the world will kill the dogs who are responsible.

But I don&#39;t like your acting skill..
Very true Anuji. Meditation does help tremendously. I&#39;am into it as well. I wish all the yougsters should follow Meditation it  helps you to be stable in every situation. Shushant singh was a great actor, and wonderful human being.

Is she is the same???? I Can&#39;t believe 

Thousands of films are made in bollywood but no Oscar why ??? Because there is 0 content 0 story and 0 casting ,most of the films are meaningless ,they are made to clear up the image of some wrongdour or proving him not gultee just like sanjay dutt or ajher Khan

Now people understand why Salman unmarried,  Because nobody wants to live with bad person,  Right decision  Aish  mottu, abnormal sallu  
These are the lover&#39;s of Anu since Aashiqui film ️

These are the lover&#39;s of SSR RIP and haters of Johar ️

Bollywood is a dark PLACE inside....unfortunately!!!This platform is just for star kids. Outsiders suffers Alot  such That this lady, SSR And many more.

After long time nice to seeing you Aashigui actress love your movie ️️️

ea butni ka folwer  kon he

rascall bollywood who destroy many talented actors nd acteresses life should be banned karen johr srk salman khan Aliya sonam nepotic kid

that was i am saying every victim actor should raise their voice against the dark system of so called Bollywood

I dont know y but she so strange

The Bollywood industry is controlled by Salman and the underworld. Talented outsiders are targeted and murdered and they call it suicide. The Maharashtra please has the highest statistics for corruption. They are paid off to shut casesDown. We need to take a stand now. Boycott Bollywood, support new talent,There is so much to accomplish in life than watching these pathetic so called actors. Fight for Sushant, speak your voice and be heard!

She is right .....This is the true story of Bollywood if they can&#39;t able to make them down they do something like this

Let me die like these people.
She is speaking her frustrations, nothing else! This is not how a fighter speaks!

The living people died and the dead people came alive. This made everything better as I went ahead with it.
Boycott salman.sonam
Bringing justice to Sushant is only in our hands..just boycott bollywood films...salman karan n star kid's films, this is our duty to bring to the ground..public's memory is very short..Radhey will be released. All of you will do housefull murder movie...remember Sushant's face before going to the BT film...theatres should be open...even a dog will not be seen, only then will the sanity of these bloody people be restored...
boycott karan johar and all its brigade

We want Justice .

I think I&#39;m a hero

Yes go girl
Sushant u r d best
My god
Kill  Salman  quickly , kill  draqula  kill

I&#39;d been seeing so many videos after Sushant&#39;s unfortunate demise about other actors who&#39;re completely destroyed in their struggle to make a great career &amp; those who already got the status through their promising works, all of them had the same tragedy happening in their lives, every now &amp; then they commit suicide, they die in car accidents, they get falsely alleged for either raping a maid or harassing a girl etc etc .. How?? We could&#39;ve never believed it until Sushant has to die, it&#39;s now all infront of us &amp; what we should be doing about it, glamour industry is worse, worse than anybody could even imagine. We should &amp; need to boycott all the things that create discrimination, that isolate one better thing from the other. What should matter always is humanity, being devoided of propagandas/ distinctions against each other. I pray he finds eternal peace in heaven!!! (Ameen) 

Hw does she survive now,I mean money

You only actress have courage

What did you do to the poor girl?
Jitne days shushant ko Gaye hue ho Gaye hen utne nafrat Salman Khan, Karan johar, alia bhatt, Mahesh Bhatt, ekta Kapoor wali se barhti ja rahe h completely bycott nafrat khoon m phel Gaye h

Parveen, Kangana, Adhyan Suman, Shaieny, Bipasha, Sushant, Rahul Roy, why were all these lives destroyed after Bhatt's Samparak?
I am all the time ask why Indian actress all white skin?

In bollywoodYou never take a break In bollywood there is racism against hindusNow people will say I am crazyBut that&#39;s the realityIn bollywood they only promote muslims and  sikhsThere are no hindu actors from bihar or UP Soon kartik aryanWill be destroyed by the pro muslim pro punjabi\payndoo people

Boycott bollywood boycott nepotism boycott salman khan<a href="">#justicetosushantsinghrajpoot</a>    
Buddha did not suck
Suddenly all failures gathered and sharing shit on YouTube to get some limelight shame on these beggars as they are cashing someone&#39;s death as a promotional tool.Sushaant was real talent and still believe his case is not a suicide.

Sorry for my comment but she has aged HORRIBLY 

Hahahaa chutia banari ha
Sushant Singh is so handsome, I feel so sorry for him because I constantly watch Indian TV series, I think they were jealous of him, he was a talented actor, I cried when I saw him.
Now I get a feeling ki Anu Agarwal ji ka accident karaya gaya tha. Just like how they attempted on Govinda’s son the other day 

Yes Anu I was remember that move aasiqui

I hate Salman Khan as much as I respect him

ab har nakam admi bolne peh agaya hahaha look at her how she&#39;s talking .every1 want to become shahrukh khan or madhori in one day.come on guys its not work like that. stay in ur place nd work hard.i dont think so someone was judge sushant singh becuz he was the best handsome acter

It pains to  see very  terrible and lonely life  of most artists .Perhaps  glamour  and money  prompts  so many  young people run  towards  Bombay. May God bless all a family  to  fall upon...

Ye sab jo aj bol rahy hn video bna bna k ye sb b sulman ko chatty rahy hn karan johar ko chatty rahe or b is trhan k logon ko

Yr jo b bat krni hoti bina style mare b kr lo ta k zyda easy hmn smjh aye
Soo ryt she is.. Our greatest hell is sucess..

Jb is famous for his accident
Such loss and unfortunate thing that we missed you on screen. Wish you never met with that horrible accident...like Smita Patil, we love your screen presence.

My god this must be stopped

Miss uSSR

Anu,  I want to say that You are looking so beautiful before  when you are actress, Today in India have the big doctor. who can do something about your face, so many artists is going over there. Kuch lorg apne naak ko thik kiya, lips choti hai to barha kia. to  aap bhi  kion nahin jate wahan , lips ko phir se choti banaye jaye  jaisse pehele aap thi, kionki wo doctor to hai na India mai

How many people's career has he ruined by being here, hate all nepotism
I am getting more and more intelligent

Everyone associated with Mahesh Bhatt seems to end up dying or psychlogically affected. Why is that, has people of India taught abt it? Including his daughter Pooja Bhatt. Crazy people.

He didn’t suicide...he can’t...it’s only murder..why don’t people understand...why people believe in fake news which is given by police who are underdressed by mafiyas.

Mahesh bhattche kam ahe heu

This is what we did. Kapil told in the show that he has caused an accident!!! The whole country lay in the sun.
WE WILL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU JUSTICE SUSHANT SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING YOU DAY BY DAY THROUGH YOU WE WILL DESTROY THE STARDOM OF BOLLYWOOD MAFIA
Sushant Singh Rajput should be investigated by CBI. I am praying to Narendra Modi that he should please conduct a CBI investigation so that Sushant Singh Rajput gets justice. request CBI investigation please please please This should not happen with every person please Narendra Modi ji and give justice to the boy Sushant Rajput
We want justice for Sushant singh, boycott Karan and his friends and salman

why was dark skin so hated by them. the whole indian population is black.

Before leaving this world, people have to suffer the consequences of their actions. Papa's mortar falls flat in one day. Salu Buddha, Karan, Mahesh Bhatta Aditya Chopra, he also started falling down due to sin. Many people are in tears
I am ashamed to speak Hindi.
Mahesh bhatt kiss a lot hain shame u buddha
Dirty Bollywood . Afer seeing all this i dont want to see any movies.Except watch 4r sum ayushman rajkumar rao movies. And abhay deol.

Covid-19 is not going anywhere. It&#39;s going to stay for a while to deal with these ruthless Bollywood folks. I&#39;m sure, God has better plan to deal with these..... Corona is one of them:) ha ha .....

My hate is extremely increased for salman day by day

Like yesterday or did an accident happen…did this child try to kill Govinda's son…or did his hands get stained with so much blood…will everything be accounted for or will he be on this earth?
You are so beautiful and my favorite .I wish you luck.

I can see tear in her eyes

Susant Vai we are all miss you 

I am sorry, but I have no sympathy for these kind of people. Just look at them, simply just look at them. They all want to live on their glamour and flesh. What do you expect.

Wellsaid

Mahesh batt criminalKilled many

It&#39;s not suicide

Sushant Singh sir Ka pre planned murder hai..

Susant has been murdered

True Bollywood actress help among you and stand for your kind then the others will be around. Stand for your kind Thank you to her.

Mujhe aisa lgta h ki shushant sir ki manager ko bhi phle mara gya baad me shushant sir ko kyuki agr wo usko phle wo log nhi marte toh wo sb kuch bta deti

Why now you should reveal it before. May be sushant should get something support from you

BLACK YEAR 2020 HIT LIKE IF U ALSO AGREE 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAD HUGE RESPECT FOR SALMAN BEFORE. BUT NOW AFTER KNOWING HIS TRUE  COLOUR HE LOST HIS RESPECT. HOW CRIMINAL HE IS,  Bloddy fellow , SILENT KILLER He is.. Just think Guys. How Katrina and other women&#39;s must have surrendered to him. Wat all these women&#39;s underwent because of salman and others... we  People made him hero. And he is dominating u and me only . plz guys dont watch this kind of people movies in theaters plz. Let us all teach them a lesson for star kids... Join hands with me plz.

<a href=""> watch this video The Indian army soldier heart touching words And the fact spoken by him will make u cry Don&#39;t ignore guy&#39;s 🇮🇳🇮🇳

If you can&#39;t believe on her, then you are such a dreamer which can only see that bloody Karan, Alia, Ekta Kapoor and Most Talented Killer of Real Talent Killer Salman Khan.
