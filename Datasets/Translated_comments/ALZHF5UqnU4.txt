World of masks!!! We live in a world where admiration is dressed in hate, you who are reading this message never allow the emptiness, screams and hatred of others to affect what you carry inside, never wish them evil, just what they carry in their hearts is enough. , just stay away from them and be happy. No to discrimination, No to bullying for a more humane, empathetic and happier world.
I remeber in kindergarten I was vibing with the boys with this fire song

Its so Nostalgic

last time i play this song 2018

Total banger ‍️
I have ever felt like this, the description is the one that best represents me.
hauntingly beautiful melody, right? i’ve been experimenting to evoke something similar. would love your feedback on my attempt.

when this song came out i was 7 years old now im 14 years old i miss these times man why cant  i just rewind time and go back to 2016

this song&#39;s got such a feel-good vibe! aimed to bring that energy to my tracks. keen to hear if it vibes with you?

a classic vibe that’s inspired my mix too. if you’ve got a minute, i’d love for you to check it out and see what you think.

their unique style is inspiring! i’ve infused some of that vibe into my music. interested to hear your thoughts?

this song’s special, inspired my own work. keen to hear if i caught some of its magic. fancy giving my tracks a listen?

the emotional depth here is something else. tried to capture that in my music. if you have a moment, i’d love your take.

rhythm’s addictive, right? it influenced my latest tracks. if you’re into this kind of groove, my music might just hit right. feedback?

Marshmello songs I watch in movies he had the sun and the marshmallow son and then the dad open sizes room he like that song so he kisses someone on the cheek and then he would love forever

this track&#39;s a masterpiece, inspired me to push my creative boundaries. if you&#39;re up for it, i’d love to hear your thoughts on my latest.

love the vibe of this artist! tried to channel a bit into my music. worth a listen? your feedback would be gold!

the lyricism here is on another level. it’s what i aim for in my own music. got a sec to listen and compare notes?

these lyrics hit different, huh? i’m shooting for that kind of impact. would mean a lot if you’d listen to my work and share your take.

can’t get over this vibe! it’s got me inspired for my own music. keen to see if it hits the same for you. mind giving it a go?

feeling the depth here too. tried to weave that emotion into my tracks. think you could take a listen and let me know how it feels?

right? this beat is everything! inspired my latest creation. fancy checking it out and sharing your feedback?

Ohohohogohhho
God music and me

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better.
