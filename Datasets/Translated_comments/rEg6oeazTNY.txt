I wonder what a pit bull would do?

Jjjjjjjjj
Somebody, teach Spot to (gently) boop the snoot.

And the sluggish old woman was spiteful and spiteful
Typical cautious terrier behavior, stay out of danger range until you figure out the enemy

THE DOG IS WORRIED WHERE IS THE TAIL TO SMELL TO GET TO KNOW AND YOU ARE ALL LAUGHING
The robot is missing its tail and head
The new ones can run circles around the dog now.

Good information.

Well information.

Dog recognizes evil

Dogs are infallible judges of character.

It's a ridiculous machine
good dog! they always know if it&#39;s a terminator.

That dog isn&#39;t happy, it&#39;s scared.

Nexttttttttttttttttttttt

Oh he said I dont like the look of that thing.Woof, woof. Go away..

Una vaina loca, and, and.
what dog is that (the real dog) pls i need to know

It&#39;s cute that the bot has no head but the doggo knows the front from the back of the bot.

It&#39;s all fun and games till Spot barks back

Snowy ......
To creepy

Ha ha funny cute
Good dog, even dogs know evil when they see it.

I cant believe that we&#39;re actually going through with this.

MAS DONI GOT A CLOTHES FROM EVA'S BIRTHDAY

Best Pokémon battle I&#39;ve ever seen
I like God's creation better.
The dog knows and is warning humans before it&#39;s too late......

are dog would run a  mile

The dog like ong what is that I must destroy it!!!

It&#39;s not a robot. It&#39;s a remote controlled metal object with legs

The dislikes are from the dog&#39;s relatives.

These robots are creepy as hell. What’s wrong with people who make or want these?

Sweet

Il I will Never meet a robot dog I shoot it with my desert eagle  .50 caliber

Where is his head and mouth 

There will come a day when they won't find it funny. Go play, go...
I&#39;m quiet. Dogs will defend us from robots

That real dog&#39;s name needs to be Einstein.

Robot needs a tail to wag to show peace

Ai sht is hell on earth . Fk their agenda

Definitely not like a real dog as it didn&#39;t try to shag it&#39;s owners leg or another dog or come to that a naked woman (I&#39;ve seen the porn).

Terrible!

Scary

nice

That is so cool 

IMPRESSIVE how PERFECT the BIBLE is in everything it says. With each advance in science, I love and believe in the Word of God more, because for more than 2 thousand years it has been warning that when it was close to the end, things like this would be a reality. Praise be to God because the rapture of the saved is, indeed, very close. Whoever stays here will remain under the iron hand of the single government (which is coming), for 7 years (total time of your government. Thank you Jesus for letting us know about the signs that precede your return. It's very close!! !!
The robot dog needs to sniff the real dog&#39;s ass  and vice versa to establish dominance.

Lol

Horizon Zero down - Dog Edition
So funny, just wait in a few years when the future model gets orders to eliminate target!

Robodog will make you as hotdog pal..&quot; I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

This is NOT awsome.....this is shit

The dog understands that&#39;s an enemy. Humen don&#39;t. So, who is the most intelligent here, dogs or humen?

Hit him with the giant frick’n laser

Where will you spend eternity? Jesus will return very soon. Heaven or hell. Be ready

Horrible machine...
Fortunately the real dog still seems more agile, but it won't be by much I think
Won’t be laughing when their AI are out there against the people ,,,,,,

Are you seen this type of dog in adventures of tin tin movie.

Lol surprised either don&#39;t want to sniff each other botty

So noise of machine

<a href=""> gooooo

It&#39;s all fun and games, Until the robot blast the dog with a laser

A real dog who looks like a dog but is confused because it doesn't smell like poop
Put some AI into the machine and let&#39;s see what happens next

Who are you?I&#39;m you, but a better version of you.Decide whether the real dog said this or the mechanical one.

I almost thought this might be a dance off

He sees the future,and is just warning us

The part they didn&#39;t show: when the dog cocked its leg and urinated on the robot, which immediately went into melt-down.

Back there terminator robot detector dog
Today we are laughing. Tomorrow we will run and hide for our lives...

Good

Minky
!!!!!!

This reminds me of a Black Mirror episode.

That dog was the messenger, we have been warned.

Wow
If they were my mutts there wouldn't be a screw left....lol
I see that shit walking by me ima shoot it

That robot is hateful

Everybody&#39;s a gangster until Robot Dog starts wagging it&#39;s tail.

Dogs know the dark forces needed to create this abomination. In the future scientists will be recognised from a young age and thrown on the scrap heap. This is after a nuclear holocaust and various out breaks of diseases created by mad scientists.

ME : THIS DOG IS SO FUNNY (MY DOG : SHUT UP HE IS MY GRAND FATHER ) ME : WTF

Beat that robot dog with a sledge hammer while you have a chance. Boston dynamics is the the home of Tenet&#39;s terminator.

That dog is probably dead.  Rest in peace wiggly tail dog.

He is Lucky Robot. My pitbull would have tear him apart like a paper. 

The dog is smarter than we are.

John Connors future guard dog!

FUC----G AWESOME!!!!!

Knock it over and let&#39;s see it get up

This shit will kill us soon

The dog doesn&#39;t like that NWO shit he can feel it&#39;s an enemy

Ooooo. Nice 
Dogs are stupid

Just remember guys - when the day comes that your tyrannical government uses these against you (and they will), its nothing a heavy wet blanket cant disable.

I love it how everybody is just making a joke about this and there&#39;s people who replied some fact too seriously.My english sucks.

The dog is the smartest one

This dog knows this is human invention and everyone is curious to see his reaction, so it is reacting fearlessly and doing proper drama.But even human don&#39;t know what would happen if programming gone wrong lol

We can create AI or machine brain, but it cannot work like human brain, AI can learn but can&#39;t have emotions or thoughts like humans, because nobody knows what consciousness is, a dog is conscious but not as much as humans, AI can never be conscious because we fucking don&#39;t know what that is and where it came from and how it works, yeah we can say the electric signals between neurones in our brain causes consciousness but again that doesn&#39;t define anything.

Funny but kinda creepy at the same time.

So nice video, Funny too

Everyone watch the prequel to the Matrix movies - Animatrix.  You will find out how robots wipe out humanity and take over the world as they use our bodies as food and an energy source to fuel the virtual world of the Matrix.

Good boy Fido, don&#39;t let the machine try to fool you with its cute antics.

Dogs know what it means evil.

&quot;Sputnik&quot;?The corona virus &quot;vaccine&quot; maker?

Enough about the dog , that Robot is crazy

dog knew this aint a good idea 

That&#39;s not a dog.

You are terminated!

Dem wyt demons at again 

Man made vs GOD made
Nothing funny...

I see a dreamWhere a man no longer walks his dogBut the dog walks the man

Stupid people who had bought this artificial electronic shit, manipulating this shit with remote control unit and just loughing at normal dog...

Just wait until robot gets an update. You will realise what a simple code can do.

<a href="">0:26</a> He does the bamboozle dance

If it was my dog, he&#39;ll chew on that robot like a toy.

Robo dog: I want your jobDog: starts barking

I wonder do the people developing these machines have the insight to realise where all of this can end up. Or they just don’t care. I mean the developers of the spinning Jenny couldn’t have known but there is no excuse for these people in being unaware of the damage and dangers of continually taking jobs from humans.

nice to know our money is going towards a bunch of bozos in white gowns making fake animals lmao

And soon we&#39;ll be living in the matrix

The dog definitely try to warns us 

Dog be like what the metal thing is that !!

Those who thinks this is real like my comments I will say u r still in ingrowth brain

Dog vs walking suitcase
“Battle mode” 
Robot dog is like &quot;TERMINATE TERMINATE!&quot;

You guys: making jokes about AI and stuff.The dog: Knows this is ain&#39;t no joke.

Robo dog look more like a decapitated emu
That’s a Welsh Terrier and a very smart dog! I had one!  Best dog ever!

Don&#39;t like this.  HORRIBLE FOR THE DOG.  It&#39;s stressed.  Can&#39;t the owner see that?

 Where is the front and where is the back? This beast
Anyone else wondering who is wasting their time making weird crap like this?

&quot;Are you moving forward or backward?&quot;Boston Robot:<b>&quot;Yesn&#39;t&quot;</b>

People: “ahhh” Dog: “everyone get da fukk back”
If he barks at you it is because he is strange and not good...
HOW CAN YOU CALL THAT THING A REAL DOG HAHAHA fucking horrible dog
There should be a piss mechanism

Beautiful white robot

“How dare you- imposter!”

Stupid. Robots are junk

Why the Robotic did not bark in retaliation?

Naming the Boston dynamics robot a “dog” is an insult to dogs.

Luckily he didn&#39;t want to tried make love with it.

Today I can truly say, what the fuck have humans done to the world ? No one asked Dog&#39;s approval for this.

Our past vs our future

Literally no one:Robot dog: Starts Dancing

We should focus on nature instead 

They are feeling happy whn dog is barking but reality will be that robotic dog will be used instead of dog and dog will get extinct ...this earth will be a planet for robot&#39;s humans gonna face trouble these robot&#39;s will laugh on humans a day 

Badass lil doggo
This robot is terrifying...

The robot is from Battlefield 2024

Dog mind voice: am I looking at the butt or face, which end? I&#39;m so confused

Everyone is gangsta until the machine reveals the weapons it has

Maybe we&#39;ll be in the same position soon

Well dog is Very serious , he felling this is Very very wrong thing, 

u good
So it&#39;s true...
I so need Arnold to provide voice for these machines 🇺🇲️🇷🇺

Actually When dog barks He want to say fuck you

Good Dog, by him in the leg

I thought the way the robot dog repeatedly bark was impressive.

lol,he totally has him surrounded

I wish Fido had gone and PISSED on the robot at the end.

Human: Haha dumb dog..Dog: You idiot, what have you done!

Must be the precursor to the war of the worlds machine dog.

<a href="">00:18</a> <b>Dude sees a dog</b>Also Dude: „Man Vs Machine“

Its interesting that it barks to the part of the robot where usally there supposed to be the head of an animal.

Bro if you do this experiment in India, the dogs will not only bark on it but they will make this machine into scrap by biting all parts 

Robot dogs make good BBQ,s

I wonder if this dog is related to the one next door to us...

Has that thing improved at all over the past 5 years?

For a good moment I thought the robot was dancing to impress the dog lol

&quot;Where is your head brother?&quot;

automated or remote controlled?

For those wondering, they&#39;re good friends now and have drinks at the local pub every Thursday night.

The machine barking non stop looks far more advanced to me than the tub on 4 legs.

When a deer thinks it’s a tiger

Still a better love story than Twilight

&quot;man vs. machine&quot;

I&#39;m with the dog

put them in a ring and make them kill each other

This isn’t any worse than a dog creating the perfect human android Just to scare us and make them laugh.

This technology is getting so impressive, I can&#39;t tell which one is real and which one is the robot

It isn’t far when AI is gonna take over mankind

Imagine if that thing had friggin laser beams attached to its head.

Pee on its leg!

Love the doggies

From Colombia 🇨🇴. Will humans end up barking at technology?
Dog witnesses the terror of artificial life.

The dog is like: What&#39;s this piece of garbage on 4 legs?

Meanwhile in dogtube some years later, humans meeting robot human for the first time

Sluggish and slow compared to something that is alive

this makes me realize how insanely advanced living organizms are.

Idk why are they developing robots

What a gentle robot dog :p

This video is gonna be viral when the &quot;Robots vs Humans&quot; war goes in full swing. Poor dog warned us already about the impending danger.

He doesn&#39;t trust the weird shaped doggo cause he can&#39;t sniff its ass.

i am telling you that&#39;s a zombie not robot.

Wonderful,,,,
I think it is kind of a nightmare for the dog because of &quot;uncanny valley&quot; phenomenon, which, I think, is on some level applicable for animals too.

Bro METAL GEAR!!!!
Should have tried a play bow.

Boston Dynamics is evil. Legislations must be put into place for such companies before it&#39;s too late.

dogs is telling that machines is not better then me

dog vs machine&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;man vs machine
the new terminator movie looks dope

I like the robo dog , nice and quite.

Where have I seen these, with 50 Cal. Machine guns mounted, and capable of running Bear-Deer speed in rough terrain.. eagle like vision, and advanced sound systems... these will probably be combat mini tanks.. imagine 100s of these running through a forest after the enemy...

Omg and this was 5yrs ago....

It&#39;s not a robot,called robot is moving without remote control

GO DOG!!!!!I would love to see the dog somehow rip that thing apart. The dog knows nothing good will come out of this &quot;THING&quot;.

man vs machine? It&#39;s a dog, not a man. So its Dog vs machine!

<b>even the dog is cg</b>

Dog is freaked out that this thing doesnt smell

Dog: Where&#39;s your butt!?!         Where&#39;s your butt!?!         Where&#39;s your butt!?!         Where&#39;s your butt!?!

uncompairable

I love how a dog&#39;s natural instinct is to bark at anything weird or suspicious looking. 

“Kick its a$$ seabass!”



Dog thinking, it’s lost its head and can still move around, this is a mean mother Fkr.

That dog reminded me of Tintin 

He is a brave Dog

Death meterials for human

Dog: Are you mocking me?

1220

People: &quot;Isn&#39;t that dog funny&quot;.Dog: &quot;You fools. AI is sowing the seeds of destruction of the human race&quot;.

Im only here because that is one cute fox terrier.  

2077

So uh...which one is the real dog :/

Dogbark Translation.. Not... Real... Not... Real..... Not.... Real... Not.... Real dog.
Has no one been warned from Black Mirror!?

The proper title is : The dog fighting for his future generations

The term “Uncanny Valley” (look it up) describes why the robot dog &amp; similar robots are sinister and creepy.   Even though I’m an engineer by profession, my instincts are to beat the crap out of that robot.

Secretly, I was hoping that robot will pull out a flamethrower and burn this lil&#39; thing

He WILL BECOME a new legend, his tracks are cool, just listen for yourself<a href="">
what a fake shit :D

I prefer the real dog.

yep schnauzers.
Three types I REALLY can&#39;t stand...- Religious nutters that think that The Bible is a historical account rather than just a guide.- Morons who walked away, after seeing The Matrix, thinking it was a documentary- Conspiracy Theorists (Flat Earthers, Illuminati, Big Pharma, IMF etc...) Who think the whole world is watching them...AND DON&#39;T TRY TO DENY IT! I KNOW WHO YOU ALL ARE BECAUSE I&#39;VE READ YOUR FILES.

I love the robot’s little Q-tip feet! 

The dog knows.

They cut out the part where robot dog destroys real dog, and all the human witnesses.

Yorkies will clamp on for a leg ride. lol

Both are man made.

Aw so cute. The little pooch is scared and trying to scare it off

Your robot dog belongs to the scrap yard.

Dog: Turn this fucking vacuum cleaner off!

at least robot dog is quiet

Oh, its Terry From Tintin :)

Dog probably has PTSD for the rest of his life ...

I&#39;m with the dog, that thing is evil, and the dog knows it.

I&#39;m with the dog........

What kind of dog is that ? P.s I&#39;m asking about the kind of the real dog

That dog knows evil when he see it.... A. I. robots.

Dog probably be like: LOOK AT THIS THING! LOOK FROM EVERYWHERE! LOOK AT IT!

That robot is moving so much smoother

What a load of inventions, they're useless!
iDog

Why do so many comments say that the dog is aggressive? Look at his tail! He is having a blast!

It's disgusting lol
Every dog is gangsta until robo-dog shoots laser out of its eyes

It's strange that they haven't already mounted a machine gun on its back...
Try this experiment in INDIA.....definitely you will get new lesson &amp; project from street dogs 

In future , we will in place of dog and machines will dance like this.

Should just chop off the dog&#39;s head and mount it on the robot dog that would scare the living shit out of anyone

OH my GOD !!!! this is AWESUM , oh my god ,,, is this a AMERICAN

Plot twist: they&#39;re both robots.

I&#39;d be scared to if someone without a head came prancing at me.

I just kept taking out the mountain knife one after another, hacking the barking beast to death.
Dog first time seeing another dog without head and tail...

Stop it.. this is stressful for the dog

I find these robots disgusting to look at! Weird and Why???

Dog : U R NOT REAL DOG!!!!
One day the robots are gona tear us apart 

The new hotdogs are gonna be self roasted ones Environment friendly steaming  directly from the processor

Bruhhhhh what is YouTubes link to &quot;radio Sputnik&quot;?? They are trippin

Dog vs machine
It it scary from our perspective so it is no wonder the dog barks

This dog&#39;s reaction is like us humans being introduced to a Terminator for the first time.

What&#39;s the front what&#39;s the end

Would love to see this dog John Henry that thing.

<b>*dog barks*</b>man: it&#39;s a man vs machineme: -_-;;; um... it&#39;s a dog.

I thought the dog will mate it.

Boston Dynamics? Hmmm it reminds me on Massive Dynamics. Fringe fans anyone?

Nice robot.

Fido tried to warn the humans, but they all just laughed

I would shave that dog

Just think if there were more intelligent species than humans and they made human robots for us to pass there time watching us being curious.. 

Drop both dogs off in the wilderness... see which one is able to walk to civilization... I guarantee the robot will sputter and &#39;die&#39; before a couple of days.

I&#39;m sure the &quot;Combat Ready&quot; ones will have armor all around. You could put one .44 Round in it and it would be toast.

Cyberdyne is coming... 

I can&#39;t believe the dog just told the bot to go back to where it came from!

Why do these guys get to play with robots? Life isnt fair man :(

Yeah... Keep laughing stupid humans... You will soon know 

I wish that bastard faced a pitbull.

Good doggie.
The same will be our reaction when we see a cyborg

It would be funny if the robot had a wagging tail.

The main thing is that this is not a beer keg
And a few more papers down the line it will look and sound like Spot. What a time to be alive!

It&#39;s all fun and games right now.

wow. it barks a lot. idk what i was expecting.

Dog: woofBot: YOU WILL BE OBSOLETE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER

Pubg and bgmi mission ignition mode the loot dog patrol robot

What the dog doing

God that dog is annoying.

fun and games now bu wait till ........ Gotham here we come.

robots? for what?
Throw that machine to hell, bullshit.

It walks like a creature from Silent Hill

Good Dog......

Stick that dog in a room near bill gates.He will tell us all we need to know

Put the pipe in your pocket and tell the priest at mass to take the money out for himself (for the bishop).
Real Dog meets robot dog, outcome; the dog did not like it

&quot;OK tin-butt, now fetch a stick.&quot;



So damn fake come on people

Rage against the machine

Dog is trying to find the back so that he can make friendship with AI dog

As a great Brazilian musician and composer Walter Franco used to say, half progressive, half jazz and mixed with other rhythms and musical styles of the 70&#39;s, &quot;the dog&#39;s smile is on its tail...&quot;

As an allusion that humans who spend a lifetime looking for the smile in a dog&#39;s mouth and sad that they never get smiles, while the smile was there all the time at the other end and compared to what we expect from the other people and from life itself about they could bring to us, when we think that something only manifests itself if it is the same way and with the same attitudes as we do, but they were manifested in other ways and we didn&#39;t notice it in the right places and ways. because they&#39;re not us acting, but them.

It turns out that the other observer is a dog in fact that was born reading this literally and not in a methaforic way and doing the same thing and without the movements of a tail in this robot there, he won&#39;t understand anything that the other wants to mean.

Lol if someone was actually behind that remote control robot. Ultimate troll 

Dog sir protesting against future job loss.

Tintin is still trying to explain to him what kind of robot-dog it truly is

Robot disturbing citizen dog are ready robot nightmare of the future

Humans: Haha, this will replace the dog one day.Dog: It&#39;s not me that should be worried

Shut the fick up it hasn&#39;t hurt you or even tried for minutes like stupid fucking dog be quite

The biggest stupidity which ever human did....stop that sh*t, now!

Its dancing xD
How beautiful is the creation of Almighty Allah.... <a href="">#Real</a> is Real

The dog  is stupid.

Dog get confused because it doesn&#39;t understand where is head and where is butt of the Robot dog.... 

Man vs machine ‍️
A disgusting bug! No wonder the dog barks at him...
Just make it a shopping cart and I&#39;ll buy it...

Freaks
Tin Tin: Jesus Snowy chill!!  this is temporary!

Dog barking in joy to see its future. 

Terrible... the future that awaits us
Dog instinctively knows this unnatural thing must be stopped at all costs.

Dog translation: &quot;You took mur job!&quot;
After some decades humans will fight for their identity as this little dog is doing..

The dog knows.  These things were designed to kill us all.

At least they can&#39;t look cute

I was hoping for robot dog to crush real dog with one leg, boring.

Gotta give it a tail.

I would get rid of the dog, he barks too much.

what breed of dog is this?

The human race is headed for real trouble

The owners of the dog thought it was cute, but the dog was traumatized and had nightmares for six months in a row.

Evem the dog knows this is not right.

Next: Real human meets robot human for the first time.

You ever seen black mirror

The dog equivalent of Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla

Everybody is laughing till this shit takes their jobs

OMG !  That  was LOL !️️
Was anyone else waiting for some rocket launchers to come out and blast the real dog?

pee jimn order!!?
Doginator
Dog: Who are you?Robot dog: I am you but better

Who was hoping it was going to kill the dog 

No robots can occupy the space of dog,they don&#39;t have such a loving heart that of dogs

Terminators becoming reality.

Did he say man against machine? Lol

Just wait till a laser shoots out of its ass.

The dog can sense evil and that thing isn’t right.Just wait till that robot is armed It will be a horrible day for humanity.Interesting and cute in its early primitive formWhen it gets armed with a kill program and the weapons “tools” to make it happen....not so cute

Is robot is operating by itself or by person

Wish the robot pulled out a gun and shot the stupid loud mutt.

Now we need guns and rpg’s lol.

I wonder what would happen if the robot did the head down butt up play stance of a dog..... Like I wonder if the dog would want to play with it?

&quot;man vs machine&quot; - dumbest human ever recorded

<a href="">

We have a terrier, they are really cute.

<a href="">00:18</a> man vs machine??? (body with 4 legs and no head is man... body with 4 legs and a head is machine)

What da dawg doing?

Why give a fuck about the stupid robot when it&#39;s the actual dog that has all the character and life. Fuckin robot is pointless

The one that's barking seems to be a new model.
It must be hard for Boston Dynamics considering how many evil applications their creations could be used for.

which is the real one?

Psychiatry is a scam run by the rulingElite

this ai will lead to destruction if we dosent stop yet

This is a sign…

Schnousers are not afraid. Great dogs..

It never showed the playful bow stance that dogs do to show they are friend and want to play. It also doesn&#39;t have a tail to wag. The robot lacked dog body language. 

That&#39;s one of those &quot;Houndeye&#39;s&quot; from Half Life. Lol, dang thing walks exactly like em.

He has a clue that these machines will replace them ...

Well, that was annoying. I&#39;m glad they aren&#39;t my neighbors.

Why does this video have a fact check under it?

Robot shit. That’s a freak not a dog. Humans insanity

If you translate this mustache dog&#39;s barkings, you will realize he is warning us about Cyberdyne.

Ayo tf your head at

Why do i see us humans with the same reaction in a few years to a robot messing with us?

This thing will kill you next year…..

Peace was never an option <a href="">00:05</a>

𝙉𝙞𝙜𝙜𝙧
I would literally be scared if I saw this thing 

Why was I expecting a Laser to come out of the Robotic Dog half way through that video? ... I may have come back to the wrong year.

What breed is the dog?

&quot;Man vs machine&quot; he saidWhat an idiot

Machine:  Dance around.Dog:  WTF IS THIS?   &lt;bark bark bark...&gt;

Everything is ok but why didn&#39;t they build a head for it.

Did he just say &quot;man vs machine&quot;?

I want to see a horse sized one

The robot doesn’t smell like an animal but acts like one. It confuses the dog

I&#39;ve been playing a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn lately, so my immediate thought was, &quot;This is gonna go badly for the dog.”

Creepy.

People really have to stop calling it a robot dog.  It&#39;s a robot.     Positioning it as a dog (&quot;Spot&quot;) is a mere PR and marketing ploy.     Considering what its function is likely to end up being, it would make sense to just start calling it a robot soldier right now. Or a robocop.

It&#39;s missing the wagging tail accessory, so much was lost in translation.

It’s all aahhh, until one of those things turns up fitted with an ar15

Notice how the dog used the shape of the legs to tell apart the front and the back and mainly kept to the back of the robot quite interesting

What is it Lassie? The cow had a baby and you ate the plasenta?

Never trust to intelligence ! Trust is only in the souls and hearts 

The end is near

Dogs will be Dogs........

Nerd behind the camera is about to nut.

Meanwhile dog - U freaking idiot!You can&#39;t replace me.
Twist :machine dog has no function to bark

Plot twist : Both of them Husband Wife having fights no need to say who won. 

I was waiting for the little guy to take a sniff of the robot&#39;s rear end.

Perfect video to see how far we are. While it’s great and impressive, but the robot is still very far from being that mobile and able to turn, move like a real dog

To the assholes developing this kind of technology, I hope you remember what you&#39;re doing when you get torn to shreds by these pieces of satanic machinery

Everyone: “Awe that robot is so cute”…..Dog: <b>Literally scared out of his mind</b>

That is not a &quot;robot dog.&quot; That is a robot. It will never be a dog. Ever.

Not sure what is more annoying... the constant barking or the humming noise of the robot dog.

All dogs are gangster til the robot dog activates the laser gun.

The dog&#39;s leg movements are infinitely more complex.

it&#39;s over for meat doggos. They&#39;ve become obsolete. Now the meat masters are next.

so why is russian state media posting this?

&quot;Oi m8, where&#39;s yer vaccine passport? YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO COMPLY...&quot;

C&#39;mon doggy destroy that thing!

Even the dog knows this machine is evil

Make it look like a dog and give it barking audio.

The robot looks like it’s trying to get away from the dog but doesn’t know where to go and then just slumps down in defeat

Why do I need xenophobic warnings about the russian government? liberals sure are intolerant

What is this comment section

that biological machine is far superior

“This thing is going to take our jobs” - dog

FATHER! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU!?

Those little hops seemed to anger the dog more lol

Snowy , come on , its  just a Robot !

reverse uncanny valley

I wanted the dog to bite it.  :)

Your neighbours will love this

This is the cutest video of a machine that can only be used for murdering shepherds in the Oil Wars &lt;3

why is a <del>commie</del> Russian-government-funded channel posting videos of happenings in America? And people wonder why Americans tend to think they&#39;re the center of the universe all the time.

It&#39;s all fun and games until the blue light turns red

what is the name of that mustache dog?

Just  put out your laser cannon and beat the shit out of this little cud.

See Real Dogs are Better

Man vs machine.... confirmed dog is man

This is xiaomi robot dog..

Little dog doing little play bows not seeing reciprocation and then it lies down suggesting danger. Poor sausage

Joke around all you want it would literally take 2 cane corsos to take that thing down

Metalhead
Some battlefield shit right there

Even the dog knows something is wrong with that. Just wait until it has lasers doggy.

Robot Dog ....... he definitely needs a head.

I hate robots, just like I hate cameras and drones. They are anonymous spies  taking over our spaces and making us paranoid.

An annoying dog that keeps barking

and the dog even dont look at terminator ;) to know about boston dynamics !!!!

I think the Man&#39;s Bestfriend can smell that thing will eventually be Man&#39;s Worst Enemy.

Dog be like: You ain&#39;t taking MY job!

one day this real dog will know why u dont bark at the robot dog .

Which one is cyborg doggo?

Machine terrorist in future - remember our ancestors were threatened by dog species while our creators laughed &amp; filmed,time to take revenge Bhau Bhau Bhau Bhau

I love that courageous moustached dog

The dog is barking out facts!

Doggo only angry cuz he don’t know which end to sniff.

Dogs fear extinction??

Blow that robot the fuck up

The robot doesn&#39;t even HAVE a spot.

I thought a laser was going to blow up the dog

In movies, dogs can sense ghosts. In reality, they can sense a murder robot.

In 50 years, hopefully we&#39;ll have the first Metal Gear created.

Dogs know evil.

Great! Let&#39;s get rid of real dogs and replace them with robot ones!

I&#39;d like to see an African male lion&#39;s response...or a matriarch hyena.

Fido is extremely annoying.  Bad dog, sit....

Scary 

The dance was epic tho...

That looks more like a donkey than a dog!!

I can hear the whine of the robot.  That is what is probably upsetting the dog, at first.  A lot of dogs bark at string trimmers and blowers.  Dogs don’t like the high pitch sound they produce.

It’s all fun and games until that robot starts barking

Basically, in a hundred years, dogs will still be incredibly annoying.

What if we call them biotic dog  and abiotic dog ..

The machine is probably like&quot;You&#39;re not that guy pal&quot;

nice Steel type Pokemon you got there!

“They’re gonna hunt me for sport?!”

Put a tail on it

great, more terminators
The Welsh Terrier knows...

Traumatized the dog smh

Dog: Run. These humans will chain you up and lock you inside their homes and force you to eat food that looks like cereal and potted meat.

<a href="">0:00</a> Robot Dog: &quot;Robotic dogs are superior in every way, No attacks, no smell, no pooping, no....&quot;dog: &quot;What about the heart...the heart man!? You haven&#39;t even tried to smell my butt yet!&quot; <a href="">0:12</a> &quot;Wait a minute! I&#39;m not through with you yet! Get your soulless, metal ass back here now!&quot;

All I saw was a yappy dog.

Call me a Luddite. If I saw that walking down the street id smash it lol.

Well if this works like the turing test, I guess the robot is now officially a real dog.

<b>sees the dog playing with the machine</b>man: MAN VS MACHINE!!!!!!!!!

Now do it with an intelligent dog like a German Shepherd and see what happens. 

This is the first dog who is afraid about his job that will stolen in future

dogs know whats right and whats wrong instinctively. M against all this, nature is supposed to lead the world, not humans or this type of ..

&quot;It&#39;s all cgi&quot;

Didn&#39;t see the &quot;Real&quot; Dog anywhere in the Video.

I hear of people online calling videos like this as &quot;Fake&quot;; After watching, i wonder how?

I just think it&#39;s really neat that the dog identifies where the front of this &quot;animal&quot; is based on its anatomy and directs its aggression to where the &quot;head&quot; of it should be despite it not having one.

Dog to human: Don&#39;t let it pee on the furniture. I will not be responsible for cleaning it&#39;s crap. That thing stays outside the house, or in the garage.

I&#39;m here to read the most hilarious comments

the dumbest humans ideas that came to life, number 1: <b>this</b>

Translating the dog talk: &quot;Danger! Run, get away from the humans!&quot;

This isn&#39;t cute nor funny. Wake up folks!

&quot;Look at that, man versus machine&quot; Priceless

Is all laughs and giggles when that clumsy beast approach you but thats some serious kill machine you have there, ever seen one of those in the wild? no right? same as a ninja, when you notice them is too late because you are already dead, fox terriers are truly savage animals.

Well at least robot dogs are not so fucking annoying.

I find these robots terrifying. They will be used against us. God help us all.

I love Wired Hair Fox Terriers!  #1

Wouaf wouaf wouaf wouaf, is this the only word you have learned? I&#39;m sorry but how do you want to communicate with only one word?

One day doggos will help warn us of the approaching swarms of drones sent to murder everyone in the hidden villages of free men.

Don&#39;t trust VP.

the dog thought &quot; these fucking humans are not even able to keep us lifetime with care  and love, so wtf with that shit ? &quot;

I think that these robodogs, whatever you want to call them, are really spawns of Satan. We are messing around with things we simply do not understand.

Come on.. take a bite 

We all just need to paws for a second. While these two might still seem a little ruff around the edges they still deserve a round of a paws.

I really don&#39;t get all this passion about robots

The dog is boston terrier

Nobody thinks this video is cute except the employees of Boston Dynamics. And they HAVE to say it&#39;s cute or else.

robot: u mortal just barking because ur master is behind u. Just let me call my master T-800

Even a dog knows it&#39;s bad news.

The uncanny valley effect

The design of this thing is awful and creepy

Doog: &quot;Look at what they need to do just to mimic a fraction of our power&quot;

The real dog has front legs and hind legs. Why has the robot two sets of equal legs? That is not how dogs walk and jump. The robot may walk, it will always look weird, as long as it doesn&#39;t get better rear legs. Designers, can&#39;t you see that yoursslf? This is a walking table, a good one, just not a robot dog.

Later this won&#39;t be fun people wake up!

isle of the dogs moment

Dog knows best!
I can never tell if these are real or CGI, and that scares me. Weren&#39;t some of the earlier vidoeos CGI? The one where engineers are bashing the robot?

The dogs herding instinct are coming in

<a href="">0:19</a> &#39;man&#39; versus machine? Someone tell the guy that&#39;s a dog.

the humm. sound sucks

Irritating

15  years later, the same experiment, the Robot Dog fries our friend with a laser because he is annoying.

ROBOT= Automa, automatic mechanical operator controlled by an electronic brain, with particular reference to programmable devices used in some sectors of industry and scientific research for serial and automatic operations.-----------This is NOT a Robot, but a radio controlled device.

Dog: “This machine is actually a bomb!”Human: “hey, fight him.”

<a href="">0:53</a> robot dog turned out to be robot cat.

This dog afraid of loosing his job

Dog knows it job is at stake

Soon it will be our turn

That&#39;s a lovely dance by the robot doggy. I wish that it could be programmed to do such things on its own initiative, than being remote controlled. Isaac Asimov had a good vision, a humane vision, about robots.

MAN VERSUS MACHINE? DOES THIS GUY NOT REALIZE THAT&#39;S A DOG?

Let’s you know like is getting wired …

Have it roll over on its belly. That how dogs show they are submissive. Maybe the other dog will stop barking.

If all people gathered to make a hound , they would not be able even if they spent what is on the earth und  Even if they studied millions of years.Only God is able to do that

This dog warned us, now these robots pisses beer

This video is old. Now they dance and drink. Tea. And be careful, they can seduce your wife in a few years.
Dog be like: come on robo boy fight with me come on,this earth is mine,I made u

Try that with a pittie, robot.

At <a href="">0:25</a> he was like. &quot;Dude, are you seeing this? Your not gonna come help me?&quot;

Dogs hate Terminators.

Prime example of a dog with a bark bigger than its bite.

God created the Dog with beauty and intelligence.Whenever i see beauty i see God almighty

That thing can barely move -- ridiculous!

That dog is having an uncanny valley moment

Painting the walls of designer

Put a mastiff out there with it and all you will have left is pieces of scrap

The Dog : Where is his butthole ? How do i smell it and say hello ?

CHE MERAVIGLIA

This will destroy the world one day as these robots take over  jobs/ dogs  / people

Hey BD Guys!On the next model, add a vacuum cleaner.

Dog&#39;s like &quot;You ain&#39;t replacing me. Get that shiz outta here!&quot;

They need to add a wagging tail

can&#39;t wait for the robot dog to be used by the police and military to brutalize people...... seems cute now, but just wait.

this feels like when snuffles was belittled and misunderstood

After several iterations, one might imagine the widget as a Terminator come to wreck havoc on our present time only to be completely foiled and stymied by a wandering pooch.  Too ironic and funny.

What&#39;s that can of Pabst Blue Ribbon doing rotating around on top of the robot?

Arnold Schwarzenegger better not reboot another sequel watching this

Inciting lol
That dog is too freaking cute.

Plot twist: &quot;Dog tries it&#39;s best to convince robot to kill all humans&quot;

imagine robots like these programmed by the elites. How exciting for us all.

Dog: wait a minute,your an imposter!!, fk humans

Legend has it the pup is still barking

Noisy pup was asking for death by laser. Machine pup is very patient.

dat dog be angree  

That robot dog is one giant failure.

So funneh!  Love it! :)
We the people: That&#39;s so cool/funny/cute Youtube: IT&#39;S RUSSIAN!!! REEE!!

The dog is like, &quot;We defeated giga pets and furbys. You will NOT replace us!&quot;

Dog: I smell no butthole, I ain&#39;t trusting it!

If my dog won’t let you pet him/her you don’t get to come into the house ! And that includes robots 

ahahahaha. and in the village of Raska they still heat the stove with wood
Sorry bro, I still prefer analog dogs.

I wonder how tigers, lions and cheetahs will react to the robot.

I kept waiting for the heat ray to disintegrate the real dog.

Wow, a dog barking at a machine!

“I keep telling these humans that ambulating robots are a terrible idea!”

Amazing innovation until hacked or has a bug or someone programs it incorrectly.

That dog knows that there’s shouldn’t be robots

If the Robot could just roll on its back and show its belly, all this could be easily resolved. lol

<b>Dog: You sort of metal, u won&#39;t replace me dude!</b>

Reminds me of the Series called “Black Mirror”….. especially the one called Metalhead…..AI robot dogs…..very sinister

Soon this America robot is going to kill lots of human beings (non-America white) and monitor the people in the name of “democracy”.

look at that dog he have  beard and moustache

&quot;In other news, robodog vaporizes someones pet doggo.&quot;

I was waiting for the robot to pull out a laser weapon and pulverize the dog

The dog has the right idea.

I&#39;m sorry but both dogs are real. Try headbutting the robot, you will feel it to be Very real indeed. Maybe robot and biological dog.

I agree with the dog.

That&#39;s Tintin&#39;s dog&#39;s elder brother..

tf ?isntthistxas ??? wgynomasingun ankilliitfs ?

Kyle Reese: &quot;We use them to spot terminators.&quot;

Hey u hey hey hey u hey fake dog ur fake fake dog hey hey u fake dog.. lol 

- we use dogs to distinguish cyborgs from people
truly horrifying.

It&#39;s the beginning of humans end

The robot dog needs a couple of large speakers hooked up to a T. rex sound source.

Very disgusting views of these manufactured forms.

Anyone else remember dogs being used to detect Terminators in the first movie?

Impressive, but I’ll have the dog, please. They teach us humility.

“Battle mode!” How prescient.

Boston Dynamics has some amazing robots - can be seen on YouTube. I used to think it was awesome, back when I was impressed by the technology. Now I just fear and loathe ai, and Boston Technology seems ominous. 

The dog is way way more advanced and responsive.

Is that thing housebroken?

From Skynet to Dognet

The Fox terrier?

It’s cool machine that maybe be useful walking in mountain I mean the size of small deer can put a lot of supplies on him and with u where u go

&quot;...belonging to Android co-founder Andy Rubin&quot;.Wasn&#39;t Andy the guys name that invented &quot;The Turk&quot; that later becomes Skynet?

Dogs against technical revolution...

But the robot can&#39;t swim unlike the dog, can it?

Cute dog. Ugly robot.

Talking to a pet dog in English is silly and any amateur dog handler knows it. But &#39;smart people&#39; will not hear it or accept it as true that they may be ignorant.

alternative title: real dog barks at robot dog for 1 minute
typical cap
More like a deer
Whats the point with this robot animal?

I really wish that A.I. was not inevitable.

he&#39;s going to kill you all ffs listen to me !!!

&quot;Man vs machine&quot; he says, thus identifying his dog as a man.

I&#39;d like to see what happens if the robot play bows.

How have not Boston Dynamics not figured out what Kongsberg did 12 years ago.....Is America really that far behind in both society and technology?

Can see the little one’s tail. He’s playing. :)

&quot;We use them to spot Terminators&quot; -Kyle Reese

Both dogs are cuties

The robot dog has 4 hind legs

That thing scares me too

It would be funny if the robot started barking back.

Where can I get this robot

When these things start getting hacked you morons might learn.

Everybody : Enjoys a robot and live dog reactionBoston Dynamics Dog: &quot;What the dog doin!?&quot;

The dog is saying, I just want to sniff your but you smell very strangely for a dog.

that thing is creepy

“Man vs machine” 
Wow! Horizon Forbidden West is looking so realistic!

Its all fun and games until the robot takes out the gun

The &quot;Awwww&quot; at the end lmao

Imagine that thing with armor and motion tracking machine guns. With a bit of speed would be terrifying.

Dog pees on t-100 and saves humanity as it rust and malfunction.

donkey bug
This Is Very Bad ........... Stop...... I warn you.... Stop..........

little yapping dogs are so pathetic -.-

that fur looks real

Robot dog needs a robotic tail in order to communicate effectively.

Garbage

My two would tear that thing to bits...

The dog that never shuts up vs the dog that never speaks.

That robot is not real lol. I don&#39;t this this particular robot exists.

The dog is wondering why it doesn&#39;t have a head!

Today we laugh. And tomorrow we will cry from the invasion of robots.
They edited-out the part where it got back up and zapped the dog into a cloud of dust.

It&#39;s very nimble.

Waste of time, use technology to help people instead.

When those machines becomes too intelligent. Some psychopath hacker will find a way to hack them and BOOM just like in the movies we&#39;re done.

that dog is smart. I hate those things.

I like how the dog is flabbergasted how something it usually pees on, moves 

HaHaHa. !  Funny. Robot Tech !Next Time I will bite it into the. Leg. !   

Hahaha

IF YOU EVER WATCHED &quot;BLACK MIRROR&quot;EPISODE: METALHEADTHOSE ARE THE SAME !!!HERE IS  YEAR 3014 AND THEY HAVE KILLED EVERYONE...

This is a trailor, to the future.

DId the dog ever approach and sniff the bot?

After AI ascends to supremacy, robo-pups will be their pets.

Destroy these robots immediately !!!  This is weak. All the material and mental energy of the dog&#39;s ass.

It’s just like in Terminator. The dogs always know.

Sheldon would&#39;ve at least rigged up the robot with a squirt gun, but you do what you want.

Skynet is becoming real

The doh vonguse
Thats funny

To what extent is the cognitive ability of animals?
My dog would just stare...

Plot twist: The robot is a real dog&#39;s mind uploaded to the machine and the dog is actually a robot

The dog just found a terminator. 

Suspicious person A
How is that playing? The dog is clearly terrified and in cautious mode.

Imagine what happens in that dog&#39;s brain. Seeing a strange animal, without visible eyes or any features typical for most animals, and also what&#39;s the most important, it doesn&#39;t smell like anything, it doesn&#39;t have a smell at all. It can&#39;t be bargained with. It can&#39;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#39;t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

&quot;Real dog&quot; is kinda redundant.
DOGMINATOR.

I got a double barrel shot gun for that robopup.

Kill the metal one,   feed the barking one.

And what&#39;s the danm point on building a robo dog costing a ridiculous amount of money when real dogs are locked up in shelters needing to be fed and cared for?!

Wow last book of the Bible KJV Revelation is happening in front of our eyes. Good news The Gospel 1 CORINTHIANS 15 1-4 KJV The shed Blood of Jesus Christ. Please see Brother Robert Breaker HOW TO GET SAVED a 14 MINUTE VIDEO.Peace be unto all.

As everyone who has seen Terminator knows, dogs can sense and do not like robots.

Only the intellect constructed in Boston would generate such a theatric induced device; nice induced theatrics however. Yet we must remember this fact: some guardian(s) worked very hard to provide over one hundred thousand dollars to the institution that allows the pupil to simulate such a creation.!

August 29, 1997.  The day Skydog became self-aware...

Remember when The Terminator tried to warn us of this?..... well that dog sure does.

i imagine hyenas ganging up againts it
Why isn&#39;t the mechadog barking back?

Dog rules. If it&#39;s wierd bark at it. ️
They made a robot dog that can do do almost everything but can&#39;t bark.Wow

Dog is a dog

Boring...

Is Radar on your health  ?

Carbon neutral by 2050.

Creepy

Hahaha Thanks
this metal does not smell dog&#39;s urine. no smell no friendship between these two.

That robot can kill.

Even a dog knows AI are human enemies...

Real animals knows more than we do if they don&#39;t like something  they&#39;ll let you know it. It has to do with robots vs real animals alot of people r not listen to warnings

Stand still for facial scanning, citizen. Your social credit score is down 3 points this month, would you like to request counseling?

A dog experiencing its version of lovecraftian Horror. Say hello to his personal Cat-thulu.

The robot dog is dancing

Could you guys put some type of a head on that thing, (below the spinning radar)

How I hate that beast I.A. Tear them all down, Lord Jesus.

What breed is the dog?

There are dogs that bark at clothes hanging out to dry. Not so interesting.

Dog: “ I don’t trust like that”

...metal... gear!?
The government will deploy these to make sure we get our vaccine

A real Boss fight

fuck boston dynamics
&quot;A Weapon to Surpass Metal Gear&quot;

Well, did this garbage come in handy somewhere? Oh, no, it wasn’t useful, still a useless ram
luvin all these dog comments, yet another dumb dog , rather have the electric one next door instead of the annoying barking all day

I&#39;m sorry.  But that robot is horrifying.  This society is so screwed.

It&#39;s a robot. A dog is a living, feeling being. In some cases more alive and feeling than some people.Look at the pristine beauty of the dog&#39;s movements and behaviors. You will NEVER get these from a machine. That&#39;s why they want to turn us into cyborgs.

I&#39;m amazed by the technical prowess and yet, this robot looks really creepy.

twist: the dog is a robot too.

twist: the dog is a robot too.

Dog can sense the evil spirit attached to the AI hardware

can they make a robot who can make french fray 4 u ? I&#39;d buy one, imagine you wont have too cook 4 ever. Like the old American dream where canned food looked as the pinnacle of inovation and covenience

Brave because scared

People don't appreciate it, but any dog ​​is more composed and advanced than that piece of metal, and yet that piece of mental costs more than a puppy, how ignorant we are, we have the most advanced in our hands and we believe that technology makes it possible. is.
great achievment in constructing a robot dog but what is the need for one?

Robot Dog fools the expert.

doge: wat are you??robodoge: i&quot;m you but clunkier

Boston Dynamic needs to disappear

James Cameron was right the dogs CAN identify a terminator.

The dog is smelling every human hand which has touched that Robot

It looks like something from a dystopian novel. I don&#39;t mind the idea of search and rescue getting these, but I&#39;m sure the cops have enough military tech.

When that thing started dancing .....

There's always a strange sound
The movement is so scary that it appears in my dreams. The dog will bark too...
The poor dog.This is animal cruelty, putting the dog in such (for him) scary situation.Thumbs down and reported video.

Dogs can smell Terminators

the dogs can smell the terminators

Terminator movies said &quot;we use dogs to identify the machines&quot; GOOD BOY

When a good creation with a heart meets a senseless monster.

Democrats use Machines to Cheat on Votes.. Yo...

What breed of dog is that? He/she is so cute.

I would have liked to see how long would the dog have kept barfing at it before getting bored..

Excellent dog for people who leave their dogs alone 12 hours a day.

You can apply now that robotic dog into a Giant star wars AT-ACT...

Kill the dog‍️
You idiots... you'll die of your own shit...
Hmmm poor dog
The dog is trying to have a conversation with it but it just keeps ignoring him.

Putin Propaganda!
Dogs the real friend to mankind, They know that the machines are rising.That dog is not barking to that machine, In his own way he is trying to warn us!

Wait till it’s weaponised to hunt down the unvaccinated

Bearded Dog 

People are mad. Dog is just a perfect creature of nature. What need is there for this monstrosity made by madmen?

The most of all thinks : this dog is dumb.. But he isn&#39;t dumb.. The Dog knows that this machine isn&#39;t good for us and him.

I support a robot uprising, look at how RUDE that dog is being to that poor, innocent robot!

What exactly are dogs looking at? Are they seeing sounds, movements, and shapes?
Who knows the is also a robot

Real Dog Meets C.G.I! KKK!
this is beta... spot the dorg...

It passed the pawing test

Good dog.  Now go and bite the freaks who make these damned things.

Horizon Zero Dawn !

All fun and games until an arm extends out the robot and grabs little barking dog.

That dog is smarter than his human counterparts ! He doesn&#39;t like that damn thing and neither do I !

Robot does tha Ali shuffle on the dog.

Robodogo looks like a double ostrich.
Machine should have attacked it  That dog was an eminent threat to owner.

One good thing about robotic dogs is that they don&#39;t bark

Just look for the fuse

it&#39;s all fun and games until &#39;ROBODOG&#39; goes in to &#39;defense&#39; mode!!!!!

What does this video have to do with Radio Sputnik?

Great

Wow, what a bunch of flat-earthers. Yessss, the AI hates you, and wants you all to BURN IN HELL!!! I guess it&#39;s not surprising to find conspiracy nuts on a Sputnik site.

The real dog be like: IMPOSTER! IMPOSTER!! GO AWAY!! WHAT ARE YOU?!?! WHERE THE HELL IS YOUR HEAD!?! I SAID GET AWAY!!!

I thought the robot will shoot laser at the dog.

Omg lol 
Anyone that thinks robots are good need their heads testing. They&#39;ll take your jobs to start with then anything else they want!

Love this one! Dog vs MechDog

I want a robot dog :D

That’s what bad ppl wants the humans to be A robot

These robot dogs are eerily alive seeming

Yeah, and just wait until they start to arm those motherfckers...

They’re gonna be best friends some day

Imagine being scared of a computer.

Its already too late if we not modified our brain Elon Musk

Tittle:Dog Vs Robot

I despise Athens.

Real Terminators.
Walks like a spider

Wait till they fight back

Dogzilla vs. MechaDogzilla
It&#39;s all fun and games until the robots become self-aware on August 29, 2028.

Dog vs dog
This dog has more intelligence than machine

its seems like two chicken leg in a box

That thing is an abomination

There is only 1 good boi here

wtf is that robot gonna be able to do for humanity???

Robots are grotesque. Artificial intelligence: there&#39;s nothing intelligent about anything that&#39;s artificial and there&#39;s nothing real about something that&#39;s artificial. How are people falling for this?

Why Don&#39;t You Build One Like AMEE?

Look at all the comments of both Terminator fans and sceptics about being locked in camps or exterminated. Do you know how this works? Do you even know what an AI is? Judging from your stupid comments you have no clue which is quite sad. Get a grip on reality!

Yeah, we get it... dog barks at robots. ZZzzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzzz....
Haha, I build it, but I don't attack it because it's dirty.
Sissy Robo

<b>Dog is feeling more &amp; more obsolete with every second it see&#39;s its new &amp; improved replacement</b>

bill gates:  racist dog

They remind me of the aliens in war of the worlds tv show on starz. I don&#39;t like them one bit nope

Creepy

A robot realistic. enough to fool your dog.

This is not à &quot;robot&quot; its controled by à controller not automatic
&quot;Shut up, carbon based life form, and bow down!&quot;

That dog is right to fear this virus of robot

I was waiting for the robot to hike its leg up and REALLY make the little guy mad.

This is creepy

I, for one, am looking forward to our dog robot overlords. They’re too cute to be that angry with, and, if we play our cards right, we might just be allowed to sleep in the bed with them (but only at the foot of the bed).

Reminds me of the one episode from Tom and Jerry

Remeber how dogs used to bark in Terminator when they saw the T-800?

Imagine the robot shooting a laser

Well, we know what dogs think of weird robots. Also, why doesn&#39;t it have a head. It makes it seem so sinister.

They will definitely put guns to it. What a fucking dystopian world we are about to experience and it won&#39;t take long.

Man's best friend doesn't like machines
You should teach the robot dog to do a play bow.

Clearly Spot needs a tail to wag.

Tell that dog to shut up

<a href="">0:26</a> I died laughing
2021: Real dog meets Boston Dynamics robot for first time!2027: Real dog gets shot by Boston P.D robot for first time!

I will translate the words he said to you:<i>&quot;Humans, how could do such blasphemy to our Canine-Kind.&quot;</i><i>&quot;You have replaced us. Digusting.&quot;</i><i>&quot;Humans are more stupid than I thought, a waste of precious materials.&quot;</i><i>&quot;It should have been a Chew Toy rather than a cheap copy.&quot;</i><i>&quot;The noises it makea disturbs our Auditory Centrals.</i><i>It sounds ridiculous. Atrocious. You must turn off this</i> <i>piece of abomination perhaps???&quot;</i>

Thats how i met your mother ?

I can only Imagine the dog with the voice and demeanor of Charleston Heston at the end of planet of the apes.  &quot;You Fools! You Madmen! What Fatal Hubris, What Fevered Insanity Inspired You to Create this Unholy Trinity of Man, Dog and Dyson!? Damn You! Goddamn You All to Hell!&quot; That&#39;s just how I hear it.

This looks scary as hell. I can&#39;t be only one who feel that way. Like some cyber-monster drone from System Shock franchise. Can&#39;t they make it somewhat tolerable? : /

Real dog meets spot

Look at that tail. That dog is nervous  AF 

This dog senses the future.

Stop playing god!!! Youll doom us all!!!

That&#39;s a zombie headless creature, really scaring due to its alikness with a living one

the dog is so confuse ,he want to know where this dog came from but there is not smell

Me on 1st December* <a href="">0:28</a>

Class!)))
I know alot of people are swept off their feet with all this tech, and I admit that it appears fun. However...this shit is creepy.

Toy

Boston makes good job...
<a href="">0:23</a> shut up and dance!

When dogs are fighting (barking at something outside or threatening something), they are protecting their owners who are absent-minded.
Fantastic
Waiting to see another dog try to hump it.

It&#39;s like a Terminator, but for dogs.

Terriers, toughest pound for pound dogs ever.  Cutest beards ever also

If you ever meet one of these things, please destroy it. Go and seek them out.

y’all realize this the exact moment robots decided to kill al humans for making it so fkn incompetent. robogodzilla would rekt thats dog.

the evil robot will kill not only the dog but the humans soon after

it knows that thing is a terminator!

The dog is barking at the robot like it was another dog.

Work needs a tail
Now that’s a metalhead

Suggest your mother or father. I didn’t subscribe.

This is how humanity dies... with thunderous “aww”s

Shoot that robot. We do Not need robots!

black mirror future this represent and I will not obey

<a href="">0:24</a>  He invite the dog to dance !!!

Kept waiting for Boston to fire his disintegrator ray.

That means find something worth doing....

That doesn&#39;t mean do it better....

Embarrassing at worst..

Half ass at best...

I&#39;m not hating on your robot, I am asking what you accomplished?

There are amateur boxers with better footwork, only theirs is half memorized. This is like trying to make a boxer look like he knows what he is doing, only everybody can tell he doesn&#39;t....

This robot behaves nothing like a dog, nor is there a function that comes to mind in which it may...Even if it were a &quot;decent&quot; replica, what function has been accomplished? SAD

Boston Dynamics = Cyberdyne Systems

that thing to me looks weird

Dude I want to kick this dog

I wonder what the dog actually thinks it is?

get&#39;em scotty
Rage against the machine.

Camber? Fine control down to the details!
What a cutie...I mean the dog.

Absurdo.

This reminds me of a saying ive adopted from dog training.&quot;german shepherds are not really dogs;there more like super computers with fur&quot;,looks like your on your way to building <a href="">one.lol</a>.

We laughing at the dog how he reacts, but how will we react when we see a humanoid headless machine coming towards us?

The dog be like:&quot;Who tf are you, n**ga?  Identify yourself&quot;.

Cute not until the robot just stab the dog

How much progress has been made, dogs will soon be replaced by robots.
Life   is  so tough.... It makes  u a robot  .... There is no place for  emotions 

Awe so cool.the real dogs a winner.great video.great build!

<a href="">0:51</a> - That Welshie is in a handicapped spot.

You can&#39;t wear out a Welshie.

Kinda looks like Snowy, Tintin’s dog.
&quot;thats awesome&quot;yeah its really awesome, just think of how awesome it&#39;ll be when they go door to door looking for ridiculous debts and serving unjust warrants

The dog is saying &quot;someone KILL this abomination right NOW&quot;!

<b>*real dog head suddenly opens and a little alien jumps and starts running*</b>

Poor thing. Even dog’s job had been automated.

C&#39;mon Dog!

In movies dogs always bark to evilness

horrible !!! this will be our end. :(
The dog was actually saying lay down.

What is that thing used for?

Robot dog, no, its a table with moving legs...

One can kill you and the other one can&#39;t.

Its like Terminator, dogs are barking...

fuck em up bobby!

It needs a wagging tail to show dogs it&#39;s friendly.

Man vs machine? More like Dog vs Machine...
My dog does the same thing with my lawn mower.

<b>Terminator theme</b>

<b>Dog internally freaks out like he&#39;s on an acid trip likely in his head screaming profanitys &quot;WHAT THE $%^&amp; US GOING ON?!? WHAT THE $%^&amp;!? WHAT THE $&amp;^%?&quot; as a human being would when discovering an alien race IRL.</b>Human: Oh cool it&#39;s like dog vs. machine!

Italians soon it's your turn!!!!
I don’t believe you stupid fucks know what you’ve created

No head. No teeth. No problem.And it smells of lubricant.

I was just waiting for someone to come over and say &quot;Can someone shut up that scottie dog please?&quot;

Think,You meet the Headless terminator for the first time. That&#39;s how dog felt

Ask me, all my teeth are broken.
Yea Robo-dog does the Ali shuffle

Real dog meets Boston Dynamics CGI Robot Dog

<a href="">0:31</a> “Battle mode” turrets swing out from both sides and instantly murder the dog

It’s more like horse

Eventually they will kill us all

This is such a creepy machine.  Sick &#39;em  boy!

That dog is amazing

I&#39;d really like a steamroller to roll over that stupid robotic &#39;dog&#39;!

Robot but the human uses remote controler .....

Dogs will rally with fire torches and dog supremacist flags and shout&quot; YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US&quot;

<a href="">0:19</a> &quot;man vs. machine&quot;  That&#39;s one strange looking man.

Detroit: become doggy

The future army makes you laugh because the ribot is programmed to be a nice dog  but it can also be programmed to become a killer, laugh, blind bunch
Doggo at the end: And STAY down!

Dog: So my species is next to be replaced by a robot.

its scared shitless of it and so it should be.

Boston dynamics robot dog meets real dog for first time.

In the future people will have dogs to help them clarify who is natural and who is AI.

Machine: “I surrender.”
Soon this kind of crap will be all over the planet.
man vs machine, power extreme, treme, treme!

Imagine you must go on a dangerous mission, to defuse a bomb or something... and this little runt keeps annoying you while you doing your job.. then you just lay down and give up on life :(

Straight out of Terminator. Best reason to have a dog in the 21st century

Sputnik. Messing with paranoid schizophrenics (in the west) since 2014.

Spot and Fido, everybody! Big thanks to Person for filming this at Location!

How clumsy that robot looks compared with a dog.

Dog: &quot;Get tf out my hood, you Im Pos Terr.&quot;

Real dog: * sniff sniff* I can&#39;t smell him.Robot dog in distance: ........
My Cocker would run away. He hates the sound of gas running through a gas meter and growls and backs away. LOL

Man dog is already worried about being replaced by the robots yet we&#39;re still chilling here

That’s a dog’s alert bark, it’s like, “Hey, hey! Come look! Come look at this! Come look! Hey, you guys! Hey! Hey! Come look!”

I&#39;ll take a real dog over a robot any day .

Go real doggy!
RESSI... Is that you? What did they do to you? Electronics, to the rescue!!!
In the beginning there was men and for a time it was good

Its all fun until the robot barks back

Fun fact: the dog is a robot and the robot is the real dog

not a very well trained dog ..  Doesn&#39;t even listen

Robot: existsDoggo: <b>WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

He is a hop step dancing

I would pay a dog a year&#39;s worth of bones to tear that thing apart.
