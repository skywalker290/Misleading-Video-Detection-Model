Turkish title

I just realized how much autotune he used. He’s not talented when it comes to singing but he’s good a rapping and roasting.

<b>OO MA GAWD U CAN SEE HER BOBS</b>

Whats wrrong

Is this a joke?

In 2021 this is very cringe to watch

Cool 😎
Looking back at this and remembering that I actually liked this song says a lot

im 13 heard this sog when i was 8 or 7

why do i remember all the lyrics

I remember when I watched it was right on the day it came out and it was right before I went out to get my new passport

i loved this song. made me feel like a baddie. but now logan paul sucks

2015 to 2019 were the best days my life and probably of many others

Imagine taking this song seriously lmao

The joke 😂😂
I totally erased this song from my mind 😂

I remember when I was younger I was proudly part of the logang, watching logan Paul’s vlogs and loving his music and memorizing the lyrics to every song I still remember the lyrics and realized I was a weird kid but I don’t regret watching his vlogsI regret not cherishing the old days of YouTube

That fact that I still remember all the lyrics to all of his songs

Hello

Hi

no one :   the girl : emo/broken/likes jake/never talks/werewolf/vampire

Omg remember when this first came out!! These days man 😢😭👏🏾 the songs still 🔥!!

This song is still kinda good 😭

I feel the same way

I wish you would see my comment and help me with money, 💔

I used to love this song like 3 years ago now it’s so weird

Very educational

That ending do
I remember when I first watched this when I was 12 and was really fascinated by it (I dunno why) and I would always watch it at midnight so I didn’t get caught watching it by my parents lol

Have say that both of those brothers have most idiotic hair.

Greetings from Turkey LOGAN PAUL

Logan Paul sure enjoyed having the woman in his music video as he enjoyed touching her as he was singing in which part of the music video is in a dream sequence.

This is the most cringe thing I’ve ever seen

i didnt know that was bella thorne-

This song should have been made by Justin Bieber in 2010 He only wishes girls were outta his hair

This is a work of art. I miss this period of time

dont ask me why im here

Logan Paul was so cute back than looked like a big teddy bear he’s so different looking now I miss this him.

Logan looks exactly like Jake in the thumbnail.

Logan looks exactly  like Jake in the thumbnail always thought it was jake that’s I I never listen to it until now cause I don’t listen to Jake only Logan,

I remember being 9 years old thinking he was better then Justin Beiber. Now as a 12 year old I think back on what the FUCK was I watching ?

So cringe
Idc what y’all say Logan Paul is probably the only youtuber who has good songs

I do not know what is this song but i like this song is good good jod jake paul

Anyone in 2021

2021?

Who is here after paul&#39;s entry into wwe smackdown

It started spicy and ended up horror

The acting is so bad

Ok but he probably already forgot this girl 👧

pov: youre here after 4 years bc you cant remember if this song was good or badedit: its a horror movie

Let’s be honest here, this is genuinely a good song to listen to when you wanna vibe, despite his career, this is actually good

Who&#39;s head in 2021?! lol

Did this show up in anyone else&#39;s recommendation??

God please forgive me for giving this a view

Helli

Oh lan
2016 and 2017 were the golden years. now we are stuck in our home trying to get a throwback to those golden years.

this song = worse than trash

Logan looks like a pimp Hahaha
I like the song but best part is <a href="">03:08</a>

2021?

I never knew this song existed

S*<b>*</b> adammm

2021 listening here 👀👀👀
WTF

bad

when you realise its not out of my head, but out of my hairwat?

Ph my gosh dis song..
In Arabic in the video
Omg this just came up lol I can’t believe I have been a Paul fan for 3 years lol

So weird but funny 😆

Oh what the fuck how much autotune do yo useOh mierda cuanto autotune utilizas

ARE YOU A PERVERT? WHAT ARE YOU SHOWING PEOPLE? DIRTY PEOPLE, DISGUSTING PEOPLE, DISPARSE Enes Batur Fan klab Enes's followers know
At last be serious in a music video

i don’t know why i actually like this song

wow

Deli

Wtf

Holy crap, I remember watching this and truly forgot about this song. Also the concept is to funny. I can&#39;t BAHAHAHAHAHA

Me three-ish years ago: <b>Singing along to this while probably wearing a logang shirt</b>Me now: W h a t  l a  f u c k

This is the dumbest song and video I have ever seen. Stop singing please just stick to being a sometimes funny idiot!

is she adult strrr??????

lmao I forgot all about this song but the beginning sounds like M.I.A by Why Don&#39;t We lol it sounds the exact same

Oh god, a deleted episode of shake it up...

Samantha

<a href="">0:43</a> ewwww... 😶
i was so obsessed with this song

who in 2021?

I forgot about this song

Logan Paul, aren't you exaggerating a bit? Looks like he's a pervert?
I just noticed now that that’s Bella Thorne

We caught up with you
Cringeeeeeee
I forgot- is bella wearing a shirt or nah

2021 any one no just me okay 😂

this song is shittt

Now i&#39;m concerned about the old me that likes logan.

Wtf is this

Now i know why my father would get mad at me whenever I watched this💀

😠

bad

What a lovely vanity project for Bella and Logan. Can we stop with these &quot;music&quot; videos where we just watch youtubers stroke their egos by portraying themselves as sexy and hot and cool? Can we have music where the singer has something to say besides &quot;LOOK AT HOW COOL AND HOT I AM!!&quot;

Im just here to tell you to leave and listen to real music

Still Listening This in 2021

TURK UM ALHA SHUKUR
Holy shit what was i listening to?

I remember when this came out and me and my friend where so excited.

HOLY SHIT I FORGOT BELLA THORNE WAS IN THIS-

L. LIke. YOur. VIdeo. .Logan. PAul

Exactly like Red Beast
At least she'd wear a bra for the sake of decency, it's not for nothing that she'll lose her tit
“Duh Christy even vegans like pizza” lol 😂
I never inre this was a song

<a href="">0:48</a> wait hol up i just barley notice is that bella thorne?

I&#39;m both a Loganger and a Jake Pauler.

Bad song.
No.

Same I remember when this came out and I couldn&#39;t stop listening to this

Can’t believe I watched this in FRICKING FOURTH GRADE. What was I thinking?

bullshit

........

It disturbs me how much I  like this song even though the meaning is so damn weird

Not me listening to his music 3 years later bc I&#39;m bored

Is this a joke?

Friends, I&#39;m the one who subscribes to my channel.

I just realized its bella thorne

He sings good though but the videos really disgusting

I remember watching this when it just came out but I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s already been 3 years.😂

So hair
this is one of that songs where I don&#39;t see people saying &quot;who is listening to this at 2021&quot; lol

I feel so bad for Logan that girl is crazy I would not be able to get her outta my hair ether

Okay but Logan is a really good singer

Hello I love your video so much🔰🌻🍎🌺🍍🐹

Now i know why people hated Logan Paul 😂😂

this song slaps

2021?

I can’t get how trash this is outta my hair.

Logan is this fake?

Bruh why the hate, I&#39;d party to this banger

The Oh my god at the end

Was that aboutttt...

please give me a subscription, I&#39;m filming a lego battle it takes us a few hours and it doesn&#39;t have much success please support me thanks

Why is there a bald girl in a song about hair?

Here Quarantine vibes he a talented singer when he not rapping these songs is more his brand and even some the rap one are low-key fire 🔥 but not like his pop song&#39;s here in 2021 who agrees with me on this one...

Actually kinda funny

Poor peep had to see this..

I just realized it&#39;s Bella thorn

Okay why is the song actually catching tho

The fact that I just sat down and watched that entire video means. Somethings is wrong

I only remember this song because i was looking through my old ipad and found a video of me lypsincing
