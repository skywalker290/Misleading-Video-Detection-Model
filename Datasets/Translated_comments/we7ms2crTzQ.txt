Hilarious, they should give these cars away in the middle east.

You are right!!!! I&#39;m alive thanks to a VW Polo 9N lie theone on this commercial.

Germany above everything!
This ad is excellent. Too bad we don't broadcast it on TV.
My Sense of Humor is better than all of yours, and im fucking german.



This Vid rocks!

xD im german, and i find it fucking funny. im sorry for this xD

This is not a Volkswagen commercial, in fact VW HQ doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s very funny either, if ever they find out who&#39;s responsible for this, they&#39;ll sue him or her.

So, Germans have no sense of humour? Well there&#39;s is a current VW commercial on German TV showing a group of scientists trying very hard to be funny and failng miserably of course. The punchline: Germans aren&#39;t famous for their sense of humour, but then, who wants funny cars?

Get it.
I love it!!!  The commercial and the car....wish they would bring it to North America

nice!!
