I love horror movie
Pennywise was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died

whoever is watching this teaser 4 years from this release is a real one.

<a href="">2:45</a>

I watch both my uncle and my dad said it was super scary and I am five years old and it’s not scary just kidding I am seven and it’s not scary

The dancing grandma is funny af but I still though it was a little scary. But then, at the theater, when she comes as a monster.... Bruh the face is literally a joke wtf, not scary at all

I Love the two movies, Bill Hader is there, i Love so much the two movies but the first movie will always be the best

<i>ooohoohoohoo!</i>    <i>ooohoohoohoo!</i>                                                  
Does <i>anyone</i> talk about how amazing some actors who are only ever in some short scene like this old lady, are?.... She is FREAKY and it&#39;s because of her mannerisms and expressions and timing etc etc

<a href="">2:17</a> On September 6 THE SECOND CHAPTER OF IT ARRIVES

<a href="">2:49</a> IT Chapter 2 RATED R September 6 2019

This is one of the best movie trailers ever made bro still come back to watch this so underrated

No.1 scariest movie ever
This movie was a comedy

<a href="">2:45</a> it can&#39;t be an It trailer without Pennywise.. Loved that

It: Chapter Two continues brings the Losers Club back to Derry, Maine to reunite and defeat Pennywise for good. It’s pretty frightening at times, emotional with it’s music and scenes, and gives me a good feeling once it’s over.

This is a brilliant trailer as it builds up with adult Beverly revisiting her childhood home and the old lady reciting lines that would imply that Pennywise is back, then into other parts of the movie with the rest of the Losers Club reuniting. IT’S ALL AWESOME!!!

I like that trailer. It was creepy. <a href="">1:58</a> even that old lady is naked 

<a href="">2:46</a>

<a href="">2:30</a>

I’m afraid of old people now

When I am watching this I watched it at night and the grandma dancing in the back kinda scared me ngl

Man these McDonald’s commercials are really getting out of hand.

<a href="">2:45</a>

This is horrifying and terrifying that the five nights at Freddy&#39;s movie

<a href="">2:29</a> <a href="">2:33</a> Thursday September 28th 2023

IT and The Shining are some of the greatest horror movies oit there. Well done, Stephen King.

Spectacular It Chapter Two

Very Elegant and Strong Warner Bros Pictures

Wonderfull It Teaser

Just rewatched both. I remember the hype for the sequel. Good times.

Mrs kersh la monstruo
<a href="">2:30</a>

if you pause at <a href="">2:24</a>, you’ll notice that (for some reason) the main cast is replaced by completely different people in the shot. i wonder why they did that.

I love Bill Hader.
Great movie, great actor, great scene

“Name something a burglar would not want to see when he breaks into a house…”

<a href="">2:24</a> Wow. The Scene with Heorgie gave me Goosebumps.

Bruh, these McDonald&#39;s conmercial are getting out of hand

Wooh....what a movie

no bad cgi 
Came here to watch this in 2023

<a href="">2:13</a> I hope you were wearing headphones. Brilliant usage of the running sound.

<a href="">2:16</a>

Why is adult Mike so jumpy and nervous in this, he was the calmest of them all.

The nostalgia I’m getting from this trailer

Everything about this trailer is amazing. The music, the editing, the tension, everything.

Tim Curry did it better!

Please make a it chapter 3

It’s so funny how most of this trailer was one scene 

I’m soooooo glad my Nan isn’t like this one 

<a href="">2:34</a> if memory serves this small clip was never used in the movie, and I wonder why? I’m in the middle of reading the book so maybe I’ll come across something like it, but I feel like if I do I’ll end up wishing that they kept it in the movie

no

I AM A GOD! I DON&#39;T BELONG HERE!

I am in the middle of reading the book of this. I have had many dreams about it, but it is a very good story.

Still watching this trailer in 2023! It&#39;s that good. No pun intended.

The old lady is more terrifying than Pennywise.

Got this on dvd...love it...the guy who plays the clown...he is really good...the rest of the cast...also...first class acting

IT Chapter One: IT Chapter Two: 
I&#39;m surprised Bill never won a oscar from his performance.

I rewatched it, and it&#39;s better than I first realized

Let’s just kill Vecna now when Stranger Things 5 comes in 2024

McDonald’s commercials are getting ôut of hand

No one who dies here ever really dies

Excuse me sir, Do you have Prince Albert in a can?You Do?Well you better let the poor guy out!

IT duology had the best trailers

Such a shame this movie wasn’t as good as the trailer made it out to be

One of the greatest trailers you’ll ever see.

I think since Andy muschietti did so good with it 2017 and it chapter 2 2019 I think he should totally make an AAAHH real monsters live action movie and make more sequels to it

You ll float too you ll float too you ll float too you float too you ll float toooooooooooo️
Fax

<a href="">2:16</a> ahhhhhhhhhh yeah

Just watched it and as I felt…they always mess up the sequels. I know many people loved it but for me it was a miss. I REALLY LOVED the first movie - the plot, creep, child actors and specially the romance b/w Bill and Bev. This movie was not that good. I felt the casting was not good and overall story was just okay… like the way they defeated it - that I felt was kinda miss

2;18 to the end is give me …. Weird feeling

Always that same evil grandma actress

Chapter 3 plz

I remember the day when this trailer dropped. I was watching the countdown for the video, waiting for it to come. And when it finally did,my WiFi was acting up. For like 10 minutes.

Holy shi it&#39;s scary sf

Love how finn wolfhard couldn&#39;t come back again

Boring and long sequel

This will hit hard after 27 years! 

chapter one is also great

awesome MOVIE...must watch ....i feel goosbumps

<a href="">2:30</a>

the best part of it chapter 2 was when he was flying and singing that song

The best teaser for horror movie ever

Who&#39;s here after they announced a prequel series?

No one ever really dies lol

Is it me or was naked grandma doing the floss in the background ?

He’s a good boy :)

You like It Chapter Two

SYETE TRESE

Kelly kelly has been a very popular and most beautiful person for all years

(this seems like SPAM, but it is necessary to make this clear to whoever it comes to) if pedophilia is the loss of the parental instinct in men towards underage women and even girls, and in women it is the loss of the maternal instinct when their attraction is fixed in young children, it is illegal, immoral, incorrect, and although it hurts that it is valid in extreme cases of discomfort (because there is no other visible option), it is better not to feed that. From this same analogy, the person who was zoophilic is practically the loss of the aptitude and reproductive capacity of that human or human, and both things are wrong. Improve your behaviors, learn from science, the damage is irreversible, but it can be reconstructed Only if you learn to manage yourself well as a person will you be functional, this goes for both people who have been victims and perpetrators (who should be creative and look for an ingenious solution that does not involve hurting others).

<a href="">2:34</a> when he jumps out the vents I can’t remember this scene what happened there?

It&#39;s not that much of a &quot;teaser trailer&quot; it&#39;s not scary at all. What a rip off of a movie! But it made money right?

Iiiiiiiiaaaaaaa

Turned this one on after the new Pennywise show announcement!

<a href="">2:34</a> that is definitely a scene that was cut because it’s not in the movie and it’s not on the blu ray which is annoying. For people who have read the book i think it’s the scene where Mike faces off against Pennywise when he takes the shape of a giant bird and Mike is able to yell at it until it goes away. I wish it was in the movie cause Mike did barely anything in these movies while he was one of the best characters in the book

It&#39;s a pity the movie didnt have the trailer quality :(

Love this flim it peenywise

Glad l don&#39;t have to wait 27 years for this.

These movies are more sad than scary ngl

at <a href="">1:01</a> why does the old woman just idk make it so obvious that pennywise is in her soul and the visitor has the brain as small of a peanut not looking how obvious it is she has seen pennywise before why does she not see that the old woman is pennywise.btw I have not seen all of pennywise

Best trailer EVER...
Should of given the old spice guy his old spice would of beatin pennywise by himself

The thumbnail for this trailer is beyond creepy

Is it just me or does Pennywise sound like Winnie The Pooh at the end of the teaser trailer?

Man I remember being so hyped for this movie when I first saw this teaser. However, I then saw the actual movie when it released and MAN was I so LET DOWN

<a href="">2:16</a>

SYETE TRESE

What happened to the deluxe or director cut version that the director supposedly promised was coming soon but never happened lol.

The sound of the clown laugthing is not great.

Really this is so scary️
I love itgood film
i can&#39;t forget his laugh

I saw the first in the cinema and didn&#39;t think it was scary, thought the second may be better, waited til I got it with prime, but not scary at all , bit cartoonish,  well made, though  some of the special effects/make up are a bit iffy, kinda like from night of the living dead but still with the same special effects/make up tech from back then . But not scary at all.

<a href="">2:45</a> why does this sound like Voodoo Dolly by Siouxsie and the Banshees?

I feel pretty lucky that I have no fear.

How to defeat pennywise. “You’re a fat loser and you have body odour!”“NOOOOOOOOOO”

I love this movie

<a href="">2:20</a>

Part 1 fear of creepy clownsPart 2 fear of creepy old people

Polka ch yandere the tráiler

I will never visit my grandma anymore

WHAT HOW IN THE WORLD IS IT 2 YEARS LATER I REMEMBER PUTTING THAT COMMENT WHILE AT MY SISTER&#39;S HOUSE  AND I REMEMBER EATING SPAGHETTI TOOOO WHILE WATCHING.....IT.... DAMN
iwant to be actor now

Fantastic movie 

Make a prequel pls!!

<a href="">1:59</a> LMAO GRANNY

Remember the hype for this movie? good times 

Dear Warner bros I would like so say you that it chapter could become more awesome if you use old cast in it

only climax is good in this movie

He showed them the movie through Google Drive
Me praying for it chapter 3

Sound effects were damn good!

I will never visit my grandma alone after this

My top 3 fears of these 2 movies 3. clowns2. Librarians1. My grandma

Bro the long pause <a href="">1:03</a>

<a href="">2:42</a> huh, I won’t reply.
Disappointment

Trailer Movie 
Best followup film ever absolutely amazing you just a clown whaha  said to my self now I gota go get guns and kill penny-wise when he said to little girl cone closer and I&#39;ll blow it away then bites head off granny with 3 mouths very scary trailer starts at 1 hour 41 granny opens door this is amazing 

<a href="">2:17</a> this music  gives me chills

I would rather marry pennywise (which yes he is my idol) than be in Beverlys place watching that grandma I&#39;d throw up

Remember when we all thought this was going to be a good movie?

<a href="">1:12</a> i find its quite funny after i saw it again 

Why does the clown at the end sound like Winnie the Pooh, its slightly disconcerting

2 years later I&#39;m still here

Georgie:-Who are you?Pennywise:-I am Pennywise,the dancing Clown.Then,A voice comes from behind,And,WE ARE VENOM.

This trailer played when me, my dad, and my sister saw Godzilla King of the Monsters. I find it ironic this trailer played during the previews for that movie because one of the forms Pennywise takes in the book is Rodan, a monster in the Gozilla franchise (which was also in the King of the Monsters movie).Also, Pennywise is the reason why my sister is afraid clowns, so she had to cover her eyes when this trailer played.

I don&#39;t like the fact that beverly is ended up with ben!wtf!...bev&amp;bill should&#39;ve ended up together 

Dr.Zola!! <a href="">1:58</a>What do you think?

IT 1 was funny 

That old lady look creepy and funny creepin&#39; through the hallway like that..

Part 1: <a href="">2:16</a> jokesPart 2: <a href="">1:58</a> jokes
Another case where the trailer was better than the movie itself, how disappointing.

Why would they show the grandma&#39;s full body without her braw. This movie should be 25+

<a href="">0:34</a> <b>the grandma in the background looks like me when I’m trying to box but I’m failing</b>

If an old lady I just met says “my father joined the circus” I’m gettin tf outta there

The bet trailer i&#39;ve ever seen

I remember watching IT Chapter Two in theaters and this scene legit creeped everyone out, lol. The entire movie was great in my opinion! ️

The first Arabic 
The whole time I was screaming <b>&quot;WHAT WAS THAT!? WHAT WAS THAT!? WHAT. WAS. THAT!?&quot;</b>

Well i&#39;m scared of old people and the sewers now

You would think spent all those 27 years getting ready to kill that clown but I guess not.

This movie was actually good , there&#39;s even a short scene with STEPHEN KING in IT .

I remember seeing this I remember the hype and everything is now gone the only thing to be excited for is the it supercut

Bill Hader was unaware that Bill Skarsgård can actually move his eyes in two different directions. Hader asked Skarsgård what kind of editing was done to achieve the effect in the first movie. Skarsgård, in full costume and makeup, responded by saying &quot;Oh, you mean this?&quot; and doing it, causing Hader to freak out.

Still frightens the crap out of me that trailer

It&#39;s fascinating how the scene changed from heartwarming when Beverly was reading the poem to freaky when granny went Joker in the background.

<a href="">1:51</a>When you check the coast is clear to get your clothes

At least we can all agree the acting in this film was brilliant

Hard to believe the sequel sucked this bad after the first one.

It cz 2 is the end

in it 2 everyone became so big it would have been much better if they are like 17 or 18 u know like teens

&quot;We all float down here&quot;

Gee thanks for the trailer this is how im scared of my grandma now

did i just see a naked grandma ?

RIP Richie
For me they dragged chapter 2 out. Some parts I could of lived without and they overdid it and made it too long. I literally fell asleep in the theater. Chapter 1 when they were kids was way better than them being adults but that’s just me.

Who&#39;s here in 2020 and waiting for the 3-rd chapter.

Don&#39;t worry guys it&#39;s just a movie just because you watch it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s coming for you or is going to happen to you ok?

Ummm, I had a feeling she was gonna be pennywise as soon as I started this. As soon as this ended I just started laughing like when I drew on my sleeping bro’s face. The second one already looks scarier and I’m going crazy not being able to watch it yet. My parent have held off for MONTHS and I might just get it for Christmas

Hi

me watching the trailer in 2020:*still gets excited*

well this movie was a huge letdown.&quot;Well at least we didn&#39;t end it like the b-&#39;&#39; the book ending was an improvement over this

This trailer alone was better than the entire movie.

Grandma dancing was scary and confusing , had to go back and check

I was always daddy&#39;s girl, are you?

do you want to float to? 

Who seeing this trailer in 2020

i will stick a blade in the clowns face with me wearing joker mask and i will say &quot;why so serious&quot;

<a href="">0:33</a> when you’re peeing and you suddenly get the chills

Honestly, I have had a severe fear of clowns since I was a kid. Saw Chapter 1 in the theaters and I loved it. But obviously it was pretty intense for me lol is chapter 2 scarier than the first one? Im watching it tonight, ive been putting it off a couple weeks lol

The cookies in the oven...kinda reminds me of Hansel &amp; Gretel story.

Why were both remakes total crap?

These movies and the cast mean so much to me

<a href="">1:11</a> I thought my screen was posseded

Only if the movie could have been as good as the trailer . Movie is complete shit compared to the first part .

I WATCHED IT MORE THAN 4 TIMES

<a href="">2:17</a>

Me anytime someone says or even thinks the word &quot;IT&quot;:

Make a movie about how he become clown....

Yes but see Billy &amp; Georgie that make me so sad I hate pennywise he killed a little innocent kid

shiver me timbers

it makes me sad that people only see this as a horror movie, i see it as my reason to live

We can all agree pennywise is basically gordon ramasy who specializes on human flesh. He even runs his own fast food chain.

Dude when I saw this trailer in IMAX and the woman started running and you can hear it on either side that shit sent chills down my spine

<a href="">1:48</a> that sounds liek bendy and the ink machine kind of music

PLOST TWSIT: PENNYWISE DIDNT DIE

One of the my favorite muvie

I kinda felt boring watching at some point in the film..it just felt too slow..and also isnt bev really a slut?  A married women, kisses his childhood love, and then kiss another guy to whom during childhood she rejected prolly coz he was too fat but now is a multi millionaire handsome..

Never been to McD since this movie

Who also wants the third chapter of IT?

Y granma walking round naked

Those foot steps man. Wearing headphones and watching this was a bad idea...

<a href="">2:42</a> HOLA NINO AHHHHHHHH

Interesting, scary, but somehow funny.
Ok, so I am wondering...After all of these years of penny wise&#39;s disappearance, he was buying more balloons?

Bro I want to see it again

Why isn&#39;t in Netflix this filmmmmm

I still think the movie was good, but it sure as hell didn’t live up to this trailer.

That lady when she ran that sound make me to throw my phone before the scene change. And when she gazed at Bev for some time I was wondering some scary is going to happen but after sometime the sounds of running made be 

The fact that i saw mrs kersh stare at bethany when she was looking at the pictures creeped me out

What the nice movie.

<a href="">2:45</a> god! That sound. That theme is what I&#39;m looking for since past 4 hours.

Too horrible movie I didn&#39;t sleep after watching this movie at night

The normal grandma already more scary than Pennywise

The new joker movie looks great so far!!!

This is the reason why no one likes to visit their grandma&#39;s

Just watched it...like I am blown away even looking for movies just like it. Part one was levels and part two is on a whole other level...I love the fact that it also deals with how one can be a loser and still make it...losers are cool...

The better the video quality.

This is literally one of the best trailers of all time

<a href="">1:30</a>

God Jessica Chastain as Beverly was a great freaking choice. She is still beautiful and a badass.

Honestly I Liked 2nd Chapter.. I know some scenes were disturbing.. But the concept was really good.. Felt Bad for Eddie and Stan.. It was scary plus full with emotions

No one who dies here ever really diesMe:bish run bish run BISH RUN

<a href="">2:47</a>.   HELLO THERE

THATS PENNYWISE HE WANTS TO PLAY JUST SAY NO AND THATS MY COSTUME

This movie was more funny then scary

It 2 feels more scary than it 1

This movie was shit lol

I can’t believe this was a year ago

People that watch this movie will be like the old  grandma is penny wise one of the best movie

It&#39;s been 1 years old already wow time flies so fast

&quot;NEKKID GRAMMA&quot;

INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO BEAT A IT:if you find a It under your bed, in your closet, in your cabinet stuck between the pots it can be a pain in the neck. Here how to get rid of it.1)Find where it hides(it usually leaves huge amounts of filth)2)Stay still and do not scream(it is used to enjoy people that run in circles shrieking like bitches)3)Make a joke on It(despite the appearance It is more sensitive)4)The key is to make him unhappy, if the third point doesn&#39;t work you can make a joke on his mom.

Moral of the story: don&#39;t fuck with gram gram.

<a href="">2:56</a> minute video: most of it being Beverly and a old lady

<a href="">2:42</a>

I&#39;m gonna watch this in a few minutes after I shower. I cant wait part 1 was pretty good I&#39;m excited. I know I&#39;m behind but that&#39;s ok. I got a lot of catching up to do on my firestick

If pennywise would actually win and kill all the kids. Then it would have been a horror movie like other scary movies you saw as a kid. When only 1 made it out, but not in every case like the movie Descent. Damn movies were good back then.

I'm shit, talk, don't speak English.
it was uploaded may 10 2019and now is may 10 2020yesterday is 11 months

HELL NO.

These McDonald’s commercials are getting out of hand.

How about another joke pennywise? What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandon him and treats him like trash? I&#39;ll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserves. Pennywise: joker, you&#39;ll float too.

Scary

I’m about to watch this for the 1st time I procrastinated for the longest timeWatched the whole fast and furious saga including Hobbs and ShawWatched jokerUsJexi The intruderJawsEct.Wish me luck

super cool &amp; scary as heck bruv

<a href="">2:34</a> i want to know what scene this is from cause i watch it a couple weeks ago and i didn&#39;t see that scene in any part of the movie? 

<a href="">2:47</a> Hello.. This wasn&#39;t scary, it was cute!!

Worse movie I have ever seentoo predictable and too long

The teaser trailer scene was better than the actual movie.

What’s grossers than gross mama grandma

she&#39;s the gramma from the visit isn&#39;t she? damn she has a thing for psycho demon shit

<a href="">2:15</a> &#39;&#39;NAKED OLD LADY&quot;RADAL : CHILL OUT BABUSHKAA

My favorite part <a href="">2:22</a>

If you guys didn’t know, the “tea” that Pennywise gave Beverly was actually sewage

My mind : iTs a GiRl

It chapter three: Bill skarsgard in the movie but he can transform into pennywise like vampires

This sequel was more like <i>Evil Dead 4</i> than <i>It 2</i>

Anyone else notice Eddies face bandage switch sides of his face when they descend into the sewer beneath the house??!!??!!

And I&#39;m not talking about having a crush on the actor who plays Bill, I&#39;m talking about the character, I fell in love with his personality he is such a strong and free person.If you haven&#39;t read the book you don&#39;t know what i&#39;m talking but if you did please comentOkyy bye

<a href="">2:31</a> He finally floats after all.

The most stupid spend time with this shit of this movie.

Of all the horrors movies I&#39;ve watched, this has the most spectacular ending ever. Like.. a hundred percent legit I recommend you to watch it.

It 3 what ?????

Here to relive the excitement and contentment I felt while waiting till two in the morning for this to premiere. The countdown, my eyes bulging out my head from being so invested in it, finally seeing and hearing the content I&#39;ve wanted for two years, thinking the music was the most awesome thing to reach my ears, rewatching it at least ten times and then finally going to bed, coming up with ideas and theories as to what is what, the visuals and audio were so astounding to me and I felt so intense but in a good way. When it came out in theaters, I waited a week so I could enjoy it without a crowd and went on a school day (I graduated last year), a couple people said they wanted to come with me but I said no because I didn&#39;t want to associate my new favorite movie with another person and I also wanted to just enjoy and soak up the experience. I loved the movie (still do) and although it was a bit disappointing in some regards, I&#39;m still hoping for a directors cut or a prequel.For a long time THIS was what I was looking forward to.

<a href="">2:02</a> this scared the heck out of me

After watching IT CHAPTER 2, I always kept thinking for an idea for IT CHAPTER 3 { Which I think will never come out }... I obviously love this movie since 2017. Been waiting and- I cry myself to sleep every night thinking why IT has to end..anyways, idea :1. Pennywise comes back..      [ Head : Okay so, they will be old but uh- why not make them like..after 2 or maybe 3 years.. ]2. Maybe Eddie comes back cause  of Richie being traumatised Eddie dies [ Just like me, my favourite boy died. I had a mental breakdown about him dude. ]3. Georgie uh- returns.. [ I have seen The Prodigy and Georgie acts in that movie as Miles. And I found him way handsome than I thought. I am 11 years old and- I probably just should like him as a character. He is my everything. :P ]It is fine if you cant do this, I understand.

That grandma reminds me of my grandmaShe always be naked chasing me

Is this worth watching?

that grandma tho...

Naked Granny

Who else came back to this trailer

Right when she said “joined the circus” at <a href="">1:51</a> bev should’ve knew 

Richie Hiding: Hey losers, time to float! 

<a href="">2:53</a>

omg

From September Ah shit, here we go again

What a shitty fuckin movie... dog turd on the curb could be interpreted as a better story... absolite rat cunt of a movie....

RIP Steven king
Please upload this.full movie on you tube

I  cant tell if it is scarier or if that naked granny who forgot her towel is

The trailers were better than the movie.

PLS MAKE CHAPTER 3 I THINK WE KNOW IT DID NOT END

Grown Beverly role should have been done by Scarlett JohannsonEarlier role was well played

<a href="">2:41</a> Minnie mae!
Bored to death. I don&#39;t like everyone pointlessly swearing constantly. It doesn&#39;t add anything. Nobody can act, except Mike Hanlon...I hated the CGI in the fortune cookies. The 1990 one was way better by a million times. Everyone looks Hollywood. Too clean and attractive at all times (unlike real people). Relying on jump scares is a lame move,  also. I&#39;ll give you Mrs. Hirsch, tho...needed more ancient body parts flying around for the full effect, tho...and less light. Beverly as adult going to her old house. Old lady announces her father&#39;s death. Beverly (no change at all), &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, you didn&#39;t know...&quot; Once found a dead centipede in a bag of sugar. That was way creepier than this whole movie. I didn&#39;t like the the way they used the words &quot;crackheads&quot; in the paper. They NEVER use that word.This movie was supposed to take place in the 1980&#39;s, with the kids in the 1950&#39;s or so. Not crazy about the idea that the only black family in town is OF COURSE a bunch of crackheads. Why not just use the N word as originally intended? I don&#39;t think they even HAD crackheads in the 1980&#39;s.They have to have used the F word 100 pointless times. And blaspheme &quot;God dammit&quot; at least another half dozen. Pointless to the story; added nothing. Of course, it was obvious Hollywood condoned child molesting when they used Gary Glitter&#39;s &quot;Rock and Roll pt 2.&quot; That POS is a SEVERAL TIMES CONVICED child molester! And they GIVE HIM money???Myra Kasparov is that &quot;pretty&quot; Hollywood fat. Not like a real person. The Eddie hypochondriac with the fake inhaler the pharmacist told him about is very relevant to the story. They leave it out. Henry Bowers is killed very early on, leaving out the conflict of a real threat.I didn&#39;t see the point of Mike with the Indians. Added nothing. And all the silly babbling that had nothing to do with the book. Along with the burning of artifacts--also not in the book.

WAOOOOOOO

These Mcdonalds commercials are getting out of hand

This is sooooooo good I watched it at midnight.

It&#39;s laugh is peace to my ears

<a href="">2:34</a> Waited for this scene in the movie and it never came. Wtf?!

damn what did you do with the end of this movie??? ruined :/
What would happen if George was alive?

Dat nekkid granma stole the show!

<a href="">2:45</a>-Tic tockers

Is is highly recommended or not???  From where I can watch it???

Sorry ,but it chapter 2 sucks , I prefer the chapter one ,they were kids  and they had dreams , they wanted so badly to end this things and they did ,but the old ones they were so boring I just did not like it , and what about ritchie being gay ,I mean the whole time were talking about getting layed and stuff of straight people and then in second chapter turn out to be like that , and what about all of them forgetting what happen and they did not met since that time

I&#39;m so scraret
How did I just realize “it” is crossed eyed!

<a href="">0:07</a> Big Mouth Billy Bass on the left side of the wall.

This movie is so underrated

IT chepler 3

<a href="">2:40</a> Pennywise <a href="">2:44</a> Hello<a href="">2:50</a> Laugh

I dont know what the first scene in the movie has to do with the whole story..two gay guys beaten up i thought there will be some probable cause

These comments are why I searched for this vid on yt

Malarda is skinny
Any Oscar for this movie?!

What a bust!! Smh ‍️
BRUH. WHEN THE NAKED GRANDMA WAS RUNNING TOWARDS HER I ALMOST PEED MY PANTS-

The movie is not skary at all

I am terrified of clowns

<a href="">1:14</a> very scary

This movie was fucking amazing I don’t see how people didn’t enjoy this it was never a dull moment and was shot beautifully ...

<a href="">0:43</a> I don’t know if anyone else saw this besides me but there are six bugs forming an almost circle-like shape on the window. Six members of the Losers Club come back and they perform the Ritual of Chüd. The seventh bug isn’t on the window because Stan “took himself off the board” or in this case I’d call it a “window.” I was just thinking about it and I thought I should share it.

that freakin&#39; old lady made me Laugh My Fuckin&#39; Ass Out

I have a movie

6,5/10 imdb....

I can&#39;t even describe how much I loved the movie it totally blew me away.  Total masterpiece 

How can be scard  of penywise if you know who is under all that make up

Nick where are you my love 

chapter 2 was a funny comedy =) specially the dog scene lol

<a href="">1:58</a> why is that grandma dancing like a fortnite character on steroids?

it isn&#39;t the clown that scared me, it was the old lady running around naked that scared me.

I didn&#39;t like this one. The first one felt like a comedy with a killer clown that somehow fits in the movie, the second one felt like a budget rushed hollywood movie

He can teleport and make you see anything he wants, yet he can&#39;t stop 6 humans.... Horror movies at its finest, he could have easily trapped them all in an illusion and bitten their heads off

So, the naked old grandma is the Scare material this time* S A V E M E I &#39; M S C A R E * @@

Im very happy that the homosexual persons at the begining ot the movie died

<a href="">2:02</a> the grandma was dancing

Holy crap the sound of her footsteps will give me goosebumps

I was shocked at the end the old lady was pennywise daughter

this fun i love IT
Benny’s grandma
Scare me
IT : I am a scary clown that will scare the bollox of you....Naked Grandma:.... Hold my beer.

“Name something you would not want to see when coming into a house”“Naked grandma!”

I watched this movie in theaters twice I wanna do it again it was so fun and it was funny

may 2019 me wasn’t prepared for what they did to reddie

I thought this movie was scary and tragedy but after watching i realized it&#39;s a comedy.

I would have liked the creature to appear in its true form in the last scene of the movie, because in reality I did not like its shape with the spider&#39;s body and the face of its clown face, and I also felt that the director of the movie tried to end the movie quickly In the last scene

The naked grandma was to mention Stanley he died in the bath tub

It&#39;s a funny movie!

I&#39;m just gonna say something, On Sept. 6, This movie was released,On Sept.6, The movie K-12 was ALSO released.The Trailer Song for K-12 matches the Trailer here.

This is a best miove  of my friends

The trailer was scarier than the movie.

Use the youtube app find my videos on directing. <a href="">

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This movie was predictable, corny and not the least bit scary.

I didn&#39;t like the ending Hehe joking 

don´t click more...stan dies
This movie disappointed me the most Not even a single moment scared me 

Grudge Red Band brought me back here. Anyone else?

Ay one

These McDonalds commercials are getting intense

&quot;No one who dies here ever really dies&quot; says the entity that murdered thousands of children

This movie was so boring .. the first one was way better.

I usually don&#39;t like remakes, but this was a damned good one!

Ive been waiting for 10 years to watch this clown pennywise 2

I hate it when they do remakes of a &quot;good&quot; movie!  This remake is stupid, not scary, and Pennywise looks like a funny clown!  Omg, the original IT was so much better!!

Rosés are red, a violet is blue if you come with me you float too

they became stupider tbh

CaPeta

The scariest thing about this movie was the run time...and the Pomeranian *shudders

Does anybody knows the soundtrack of <a href="">1:48</a>

My fiancee husband movie this fav

I remember being in class when this was uploaded and being scared, excited, and creeped out

I have this movie

The movie was gayyyyy

Please like me

Pennywise is not scary at all, it&#39;s just a big-headed clown who walks funny. The old lady is doing a better job at scaring people. I hope there will not be a chapter 3, or else it&#39;s going into a shithole.

Havent seen the movie e

You guys should make a chapter 3 of it

That smile 
Just saying that IT 2 was released on September 6, 20199(the month of September) +6(the day in September it was released on)+ 2+0+1+9(the year),=27 years (the time when IT returns to Derry)<b>mother of god</b>

I came after watching this movie last night .

I’m sorry but every time  that old lady says “my fader joined the circus”  I start laughing so hard cause she says fader instead of father 

Dam

Ooooooo ahhhhhh
When he said hello at the end it sounded like Winnie the pooh

Are you still his little girl. me: oh hell nahhhhh

I just finished the movie spoil alert:stanley and EDEN DIE

The clown sightings should&#39;ve happened again because of this movie.

Well hello there

Bruhh I got on ear buds

<a href="">1:58</a> OMG

Thrillering

what a fantastic movie

I have the movie and the end WILL MAKE YOU CRY Tough or not its more of a emotional movie than a horror movie

why is grandma naked

THIS MOVIE SUCKS

If I'm going to see her
Not bad.  And - Spoiler Alert (Minor) - the writer character catching grief for the bad ending of his book was very appreciated self aim humor from King.  That was awesome and unexpected.  And funny because some people thought the ending of the IT book was weak.

<a href="">2:46</a>

<a href="">2:45</a>

Lol I would be screaming cause she naked not because she his daughter I would be like “AGHHH SAGGY TITS ATTACK”

These McDonald&#39;s commercials are really getting out of hand.

Good job
Seeing the grandma in her underwear is scarier than it

Hello <a href="">2:49</a>
Omg scared as hell

I like the old one as a kid

Does anybody have a link to a version to watch without those stupid, intrusive, highly unnecessary Korean hardcoded subtitles?

Naked Grandma- Scare 100
ohw

so that&#39;s why we don&#39;t see Ronald McDonald in the McDonalds commercial

The film has very sad ending

Hey why is everyone comments, líke two years ago, is there any body from 2021

Hello Vicky.....
They showed almost the entire scene here. This was probably the most effective horror scene in the movie too, in the sense that you felt some tension and unease.

Pick a grave but not the least one it&#39;s taking bobi bobi bobi Billy lol

I love the original one

Where can I watch it online

When pennywise kills someonePennywise: look att me! What did you expect?

Legit the worst movie ever made

Wow amazing. Nice director look like real
The best movie I could ever see.... Awesome...

seriously though the grandma is scarier than pennywise

It chapter two lives up to It one in every way

<a href="">0:44</a> anybody gonna talk about the fact that they&#39;re in Maine

Pennywise is McDonald&#39;s ice cream machine cause it gets fixed every 27 years.

1999 : Granny&#39;s cook pies2017 : Granny&#39;s cook cookies 2019 : Naked Granny&#39;s
That grandma only wants her clothes.

<a href="">0:25</a> this is so cute

<a href="">2:17</a> this trailer is basically me and my freinds finding our last LEGO piece

It’s  what everyone can have happen to and why # IT’S friends want to play 

<a href="">2:42</a>

I should   dress like the crown in halloween

Disappointing and awful... Not scary whatsoever and FAR too long...

I  am  crying  right  now  
I do Pennywise makeup for halloween.<a href="">

Uk that grandma slick when she doesn’t get u the cookies she insisted to get

<a href="">#Save</a>_lraqi_people

When u forget ur towel she runs to get Beverley clothes

It chapter two is 2019 new

Why does Pennywise sound like winnie the pooh when he says &#39;&#39;hello&#39;&#39;

This is the best horror movie trailer

Secretly the grandma is dramatic

This movie was horrible I regret wasting my time watching it. When a naked grandma running is scarier than any of the monsters you know it&#39;s bad...

Fuck you all asshole

You guys should see what she looks like. She was so tall and was straight up naked. I will be tripping if she came at me

This movie was so dam good

oh g
Aah shIT, here we go again..

When he says hello he sounds like Winny the pooh

Introducing:pennywise the dancing CLOWN!!

YES I am commenting so I don&#39;t have to watch this on full screen

<a href="">2:44</a> was when i was like: oooh this might be worth watching

B

REEEE I CANT WAIT FOR THE FILM TO COME OUT OF SKY CINEMA AND SKY STORE REEEEEEEEEEE

Why in the starting of the movie starts with two gay couple dies you know I&#39;m gay and I just feel so bad for his lost

You eat kids, Pennywise! Not adults!

Well, the movie wouldn’t show up for me anymore on Cineplex anymore now that October 22nd is when the movie ended. Now I cannot see the movie in theatres which is a shame and sucks majorly. Fucking hell with movie dates though. Now I have to avoid even more spoilers for the movie and need to get the Blu Ray version which won’t have that same feeling of being in the movies ffs. Edit: Never the fuck mind. Thanks Knightwing for spoiling the movie’s ending you fucking asshole.

This is scary AF !!!!

I&#39;m terrified but I wanna know what happens in the so please could someone let me know what happens?

Hi

These McDonald&#39;s commercials are getting out of hand

I watched this film eariler today and I personally think it try&#39;s extremely hard to promote suicide it talks about it, shows it and even uses the number 27 which is a very high age for suicide and I&#39;m personally sick of it, why do sooo many film&#39;s, tv shows all promote suicide??? There&#39;s a Whole show called &quot;10 reasons why&quot; or something, aswel i think it&#39;s a Joke they can promote it So openly like its fine because it&#39;s not!!!

i would play a videogame version,like from IT&#39;s perspective :X

Just watched it chap 2 Hate to sayFull of shit

They should call it awwww shit here we go again

<a href="">2:36</a> me when I need to wake up for school

The old lady is just the slightest bit creepy

I can’t believe the voice at the beginning is Bill Skarsgård it’s so weird listening after my friend told me

Who&#39;s Beverly&#39;s actress , billy  , richie and stans?(like both of them)

The deleted scenes are still here lmao

Going to see this today...finally!

The most disappointing movie of 2019

Amazing !! Lovely
That “Hello” sounded like Winnie-the-Pooh

I watched a different trailer and I Ike when George said Bill lied and I died.

I was thinking we should do a it parody with arthur cast members

That frozen  stare! Creepy. 
[Spoiler]It&#39;s interesting to see the director add a sub-plot of beings accepted as gay in this society. I actually smirked when the gay couple kissed, but for a completely different reason. A family decided to bring along a 7-9yr old along. First thing I hear behind me is &quot;eew&quot;. I get it, he&#39;s (somewhat) innocent about these types of things. Yet, I hope the parents acted mature after the movie and explained this scene to him.As a side note I haven&#39;t read the book so I don&#39;t know if it was mentioned or not, but I was intrigued by the subtle message that Richie was gay. I also noticed (by the end) that the first death (the gay couple) was foreshadow and an exact reflection of how Eddie died and Richie feeling the most pain from his secret love towards him.

<a href="">2:46</a> hi so... do you want a botato?
hello vicky
I am not gonna continue watching after <a href="">1:50</a> sounds scary please support me not to get scared 

&quot;Hi-Ho Silver! Away!&quot;   Remember growing up in the 80&#39;s and being a Lone Ranger fan who rode a Schwinn cruiser instead of a BMX/freestyle bike?! haha

IT Chapter 2 was a fantastic movie and wasn&#39;t as great as the first IT Chapter 1, but it was still a badass  film. It chapter one and chapter two were one of the best horror films of all time. Who cares about what &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; has to say about IT Chapter: 2. I&#39;m almost 36 years old and both movies gave me nightmares.

I just watched the movie a while ago. The almost 3-hr long is worth to watch. The jumpscares were on point especially the Grandma scene. Hahahaha! I love how they included comedy. Hahahaha! But terrifyingly good.

The Warner Bros logo for IT that has everyone asking: Wait, is this in 3D?

Boy it feels good to have finally watched the Chapter 1 and now watching the trailer makes fucking sense HAHAH

The price was more scarier than the movie

<a href="">1:57</a> thanks mr later

Film was rubbish, soooo boring and Not good like previous IT movies.So Dissapointing, nearly fell sleep 

Who wants to take my friends and I too see this around <a href="">9:45</a> in Winthrop?? Lmk

Did Beverly even know Ben wrote the poem and not Billy?

The old lady is the dauter of pennywise

Pennywise: <b>Here Penny</b>
I loved the old lady but THEN WHEN I SAW IT I WAS LIKE HELL NAH HE HAS A DAUGHTER 

No one who dies here ever really dies 

No one who dies here ever really dies 

There was laughing in theatres during this scene... 

this is by far my favorite film I loved every second of it
