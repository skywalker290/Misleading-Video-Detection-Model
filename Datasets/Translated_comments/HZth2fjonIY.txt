Good acting by kareena kapoor

You are saying this for the second time, I hope you told me to save you if he did not give even then what difference will it make to you? Being pregnant, why is it such a big deal to carry the child? Just a little bit of trouble is there, but the hair is stuck, face. Boils are coming on the body, rashes are on the body, thousands of injections have never been done, urine is coming out rotten because the bladder does not hold the baby's face, no matter how much fever, cold, cough occurs, medicines cannot be taken, because what is the difference if it has any effect on the baby. Yes?Can't wear clothes of your choice because it doesn't fit because you don't like your favorite food because it's not allowed?Depression mood swings, everything has to be lived quietly so that our mood gets spoiled. Our system sacrifices the entire body for delivery in nine months. You can't even imagine the pain you feel during this time.
Actually, there&#39;s a device that simulates the pain a pregnant person goes through especially during labor that can be used on people with penises. Some have even tried it and it was highly unbearable for them which made them realise how difficult pregnancy and childbirth is.

Konsi film he

At the time of pain, you cannot even imagine, but we bear everything with a smile, because we know that when we see the baby, it will all be worth it, what is the contribution of a father in the whole story. ? ki aahh baby ive come! im sure you have never realized this varun, because you have never been here
Real life dailouge😭😭
What's the title of this film...really related
I am 6 months pregnant 😭😭😭...husband is sleeping day and night...really a woman can understand. A woman's drd...Mai 6 months rote rote bita di.....plz pray my baby safe.
Her acting ❤️‍🔥
Deepika should do this scene then let's see whether she is able to match Kareena or not....overrated Deepika
Kareena is The Best No Doubt Stunning beautiful and Unstopaable

What an actress wowwww 😘

Kareena mam ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow, what is natural acting, my lioness has given life to the dialogue.

Tears

Itna sb kuch sehne ke bad bhi  agr bacche ko thoda sa bhi kuch ho jae to ek maa ko yhi sunaya jata h ke tum laparvah ho tumne care nhi ki is liye esa hua

kreena&#39;s = legendary acting .. ...akshay&#39;s = worst acting

Sorry to say but from which angle this Akshay Kumar is looking like 30 years old Varun till now he is yet to have the first child...he is already looking like the father of two children...these heroes should still take roles according to their age. ...when will the heroine of the middle age start doing heroic deeds...
Silly

Love you Mom

I felt a lot for the baby.
Kareena kappoors best dialogue ever
My husband also same careless husband

She&#39;s so natural in her character ....... 🔥 she&#39;s absolutely right men can&#39;t even imagine how difficult situation we handle in motherhood period

Love from prayagraj 😊
This scene I can watch a 100 times everyday. Wat an actress … I want her to keep working in films for the next 30 years.

Its true line

Reminds me of her brilliant monologue in 3 idiots in front of Virus

This is the best scene in the entire movie ❤️. Every one can feel these dialogues in this scene

Am a tamil women I donno hindhi but i understand she&#39;s telling about women after birth n pregnancy struggling... I donno my eyes full of tears I didn&#39;t know y

Pregnancy is something that should be romanticized; Kareena Kapoor proves the same.

I also felt crying because I am also facing this situation 🥺🥺and this man will never understand

You tell him, Deepti(Kareena)!
Beboo ❤❤❤❤
Let’s be honest majority of bollywood movies smash when she’s in them , she’s tooo talented idc nepotism or not you won’t see most actresses with the emotions she brings. Period

Kareena ,again wow!!!  Fab in this movie...her expressions ,dialogue delivery that too in one single take with full conviction is applauding 🤗👍💕

The most lovable part of this flim. Good newwz was just fab flim and i liked the direction of this flim. All the characters especially kareena was just awasome. Thank you @Dharma Production for creating so beautiful flim. We hope that you will be making more flims like this one.

Kareena ‘s expressions 👌in single take .. wow is superb 😍

And how
She is the only one I love besides as a nepotism product Because she is all worth it while acting so damn good❤️❤️

Love you so much kareenaaa❤
Happy birthday Kareena

It is right 🙂🙂
Kareena ❤️❤️❤️❤️
😻😭💞 my bebo. She is the best.

Kareena is the most talanted actress I know . Alia , Deepika , Katrina , Priyanka lie no where in front of Kareena 💅

Can she just stop being Soo amazing 😻

Kareena has proven her talent again and again but stupid haters can&#39;t see that. Kareena is the only actress who can give so many expressions in few seconds. If u see her &quot;fevicol SE&quot; it&#39;s just marvelous. My words fall short for kareena❤️  Kareena is the actress who can give a blockbuster movie without a male superstar . Katrina, shraddha movies go flop when there is no male lean In the film but not kareena&#39;s ❤️

I am fine with nepotism when it&#39;s Kareena.

Kareena Kapoor is the best actress till date 🤟

She is the ultimate queen and there is no denying that. She is here to stay and kill it for all the years to come.Haters can roil and rot in hell!

Bestttt 💗💗💗
Bollywood drugs lo drugs lo drugs lo
Most of it shot in a single take!!! She is absolutely outstanding!!

Best performance of Kareena in this film it&#39;s makes us emotional

Really? so many dislikes??????n that too on a pregnancy&#39;s related monologue?bcz it stars kareena n owned by dharma?god damn! Sushant didn&#39;t deserve this blind idiots as fans at least

Kareena very beautiful actress. Happy birthday kareena kapoor Khan.

Her expression is always high on point and this dialogue is superbbb....always slaying🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️
She is undoubtedly the most talented actress ever! Whether its k3g, chameli, omkara, Jab we met, Talaash, Herione, ki and ka and good newwz, she has proved her talent in each and every movie and is the best example of nepotism!

Drop a ♥️ below to send all the mom&#39;s some pyaar! <a href="">#GoodNewwz</a>

Happy Birthday Bebo 😍♥️
Kareena kapoor is also deserving nepotism product and I love her acting from my childhood where her overacting is also such natural acting as poo from k3g, geet from jab we met, deepti from good newzz,anjali from hulchul etc 😍😍😍❤❤ Happy Birthday Bebo 🎂🎂🎂😍❤❤❤ and guys please don&#39;t include Kareena kapoor in non deserving list .she is deserving actress product ❤❤😍😍❤❤❤

Blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing.”

Why are you wasting time by commenting?
She is the best!!!❤️... the best scene of the movie♥️

The best movie....one cannot be even bored off a minute!💓🤩

Love this dialogue from the movie!🤩

I wish haters get some kindness,softness from this video towards pregnant celebrity instead making sort of fun from it!

Akshay Kumar is best ❤️
Happy Birthday kareena Ma&#39;am 🥳🥳
I support bollywood and dharma productions......let these stupid modi morons shout at u......without u guys bollywood is nothing......Karan johar+king khan Jodi is a legend Jodi.....salman Khan rocksss.....amir khan rocks.....akshay Kumar rocks.....inhi kuch actors ki wajah se bollywood jaana jaata hai bahar ke desho mei bhi.....inko fasane ki koshish b mat krna modi ke Chamcho drugs or kisi b racket mei....Pura desh tabah ho jaega yaad rkhna meri  yeh baat.......it is only dharma productions who gave us masterpieces like bahubali 1 and 2.....i will fight for whole bollywood.

That random person who,,,&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; Liked my comments 😔 || i pray &#39;&#39;&#39; may you and your parents live more than 100 years 💥❤️❤️😔⬇️👇Friends, my father does farming, and mother remains ill more than usual, and we are three brothers and sisters. Had borrowed some money from the village. Now they are saying that if you don't give the money, we will take your farm and house, this makes my father very upset. When I told all this to my friend, he said that you should make a channel on YouTube and earn money from there. And he gave me his old phone to help me. I uploaded many videos but no one watches my videos because I am from a poor family. I told all this to my friend and he said tell people about your problem there. I said--Who will help me there? Friend said - We live in India and there are lakhs of people here who help people like us. I said---Will I be able to help my father and cure my mother in 4 months? Friend said - 400 subscribers will be required and this will also show how many Indians help people like us. If you don't help me today then who will?| Today one of your subscriptions can save you from the stumbling blocks of the rich. If you all want, you can complete 400K subscribers. If you feel like it, help me. ||Mera name ---Deepak he gav se hu..
