Srk beard ke sath ache  lagte hai  ese nahi 😅😅

This movie is truly beautiful

I respect SRK because although he is a superstar but he still interested in such type of movies and roles as this type of drama movie usually don&#39;t get appreciated by Indian audiences but still SRK try every genre, my love for him is always increasing day by day ❤

2023 nov 14  again and again i come  what movie for teenage

It&#39;s my favorite movie

This is true srk ❤❤❤

Best movie

AL WAAJID👁🔥👁
This movie is my heart to me ❤

I still remember when this teaser came out I was just so much anticipated with this film

I loved Sir..really great acting❤❤you are at the top..and sometimes we seem to find the SRK who speaks about life❤❤🎉
After watching jawan

As the youngest child of my family (im 29 years old), I&#39;d love to protray myself like Alia Bhatt.She has the duality of being cute (attractive), and at other times being a cute cinnamon roll.For example she&#39;s being a TOTAL cinimon roll, here 🥰.  <a href="">0:38</a>

The actor... said this man is crazy about the path.. do such roles.. will be remembered for the next 1000 years.
Srk fans ❤️
Hope they make more such movies and thanks for making this one.

Somewhere i found, alias is overacting.... otherwise a great &amp; a truly relatable movie ♥️

Faltu movie bakwas

In 2016, as a teenager I wasn&#39;t matured enough to understand this movie, today realizing it was truely a masterpiece 👌🏼

This movie gives  me positive vibes ❤️😘

Font used name

Cheers to all the broken people who came here in 2022 to mend themselves.🤍

Where can I watch this movie?

This movie helped me to forget my X

It&#39;s beautiful movie ❤️
My fvrt aliya ❤️
The movie is beautiful indeed. Love it how it is teaching a very beautiful lesson for life. For a person who has suffered from trauma and had bad mental health this film is so relatable. I&#39;m glad to see it.

Due to this scene Para coconut road is getting more crowd

Most underrated movies of SRK,  we demand dear zindegy 2,  from Bangladesh 🇧🇩

That evil laugh though...

People thinks that it&#39;s Sharukh who is therapist, People in our circle play role of therapist we even knew it that it , that who played a positive role in our life &amp; who plays a negative Role. 90 % credit gos to the writer , story matters alot. Highly Appreciated, everything. Inshallah my short film will be released to.

Excellent Movie , Some time Some questions are answered by someone&#39;s thoughts , brilliant idea for this move. Really liked it &amp; highly recommend , Dear Zindagi !

Ali Zafar was also in this film. Bollywood uses all the Pakistani talents and don’t even give them their deserved credit. PATHETIC

I just want to be free😊😊

I hate fake people

fayssal vlog family 😘😘

Alia is so beautiful

Anyone watching this 2020

The best movie I have seen in my life

Why did it have to be such a joy kill!! Why couldn’t they be together for the sake of it😫😫 why ????

I hate that yashaswini dayama is playing second fiddle to Alia she’s more talented and cute her acting is effortless while Alia seems just mediocre in front of her

who is here after hearing SRK and Alia&#39;s next movie???

Beautiful movie, I identified with that movie, thank you
Full movie chahiye yrr
I watched this on Netflix and wouldn&#39;t believe it. This movie is kinda similar to my life. Like I was shocked to know about this movie.    The girl is kinda similar to me like  I hate my hometown,  I have problems with my mom,  I always wanted to become a cinematographer ( I dream to have a fine camera), and I almost went to a psychiatrist because I can&#39;t sleep and focus. Feels like I can&#39;t control my self.  But there&#39;s no boys around me. I mean no cute guys went to me not like in the movie. And guess what, my real name is &quot;QAIRAH&quot; pronounce as kaira.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  I learned a great deal from watching  <a href="">0:52</a> 💝🔥   👇 👇 👇🔥
Please upload this movie it&#39;s a humble request. However hard we tried but never found. If anyone knows other way of watching this movie except tv please help me .

Tried to watch this movie for the first time and can&#39;t even bear it for 10 mins. So much of overacting and I felt still Bollywood is so many decades behind to global cinema. It was my Bollywood movie after 10 years. Grow up your shit guys, the world has changed. Love from Paris.

Anyone in 2020?. Kindly like it. ☺️☺️

I know none of you cares but i will try to look at life with more postivity now and i wont be afraid to take steps just because i am scared that the past will hunt me ... i will try to let go of everything that is not good for my health and everyone who i think doesnt deserve my attention or what i have to give beacuse i am worth it .. And I believe in myself and i will be able to achieve every dream I have and i really really jhope everything works out for me and for eveeryone reaading this comment ! May God bless you and I hope you find your happines !

Seems I stepped onto the indian side of YouTube.

2016--- the year Hollywood and Bollywood both have come up with movies with the same theme. &quot;Dear Zindagi&quot; and &quot;the edge of seventeen&quot;

love SRK

Beautiful
I LIKE KAMWALI OF FILM MORE THAN ALIYA BHUTT.....GHATIYA ALIJAFR KYA KR RHA HAI BC ?PAKISTANI KYU LETE HO BC FILMS ME...100% BAN KARO PAKISTAN KO..BC YHA ANA HAI PAISE KMANE HAI..VISA WHO HAS BIG MANGNI FIRST BOMB HAS BEEN THROWN??MC SALE
The best thing about Shah Rukh Khan is that he puts his character, which we love, into all his roles, then he takes on the character for the movie and does not change his character in each movie separately, which makes him wanted in all movies.
It's a very bad movie, I think it's just that the lead actors are acting very well, it doesn't have a good ending.
What A Badddddddd Movie !

Please release the deleted scenes.....!!!!

who had watched this movie? I have and this movie is so inspiring

Heroin is looking like a Characterless girl, She met Ali zafar( RUMI ) in same day she kissed him and in the front of SRK she is acting like innocent WTF LMFAO :D :D :D

For some people...this movie might be boring because it&#39;s not actually a movie type &quot;movie&quot; like you know, but for me it was freaking good and great message.

I like Alia Bhatt very much....😄
I want know name of this song 😢??

This film disappointed me; I’m not used to seeing Shah in such boring films.
25th November is my BIRTHDAY

i thinked that dilwale was the last movie srk... erm

dear boring movie

I would have liked this movie if I haven&#39;t seen GOOD WILL HUNTING. It&#39;s so similar

Wow! SRK name is so HUUUGGEEE any movie he acted on seems doesn&#39;t need full trailer video anymore.

I love this movie

Just finished watching this Movie, it was amazing, loved every scene of Shahrukh in it,  can&#39;t expect anything less from SRK he is one  in a million, bytheway for the confused people out there he is not playing a lover&#39;s role in this movie. Great movie, give it a try.

It was a really good movie. Must watch.

love u aliya and ur movie dear zindagi is fab....i m from pakistan😘

I mean wtf sharokhan i don&#39;t know if I spelled it right nor spelled looks like her father

a very good movie great job

awesome 😍

awesome 😍

Bahut video movie g
such a good movie ,gauri shinde and team deserves applause ,film makers do this experiment but not every film maker could make audience understand their story

yeaaaaa love you zindagi 😘😘
What thought did you make this movie? ...watch this sad movie vomit aa gyi thi
owu really nice song. you are my best favour hero of bollywood. I love u forever.

owu really nice song. you are my best favour hero of bollywood. I love u forever.

This film has a beautiful consept inside it❤❤

What a movie! The scenes with SRK and Alia Bhatt are the best in this movie

this is a bit awkward cuz most psychologists irl are not really like this.

alia👍shahrukh 👎👎
I'm a big SRK fan,,, but this movie doesn't have as much fun as it does in Chennai Express, happy new year,, Fan mein aaya.. In my opinion, even Shahrukh Bhai himself may not watch this movie full.. Why would they waste their time in its preview show.. I found it so boring in the opening, I would get bored of Alia's Mokka dialogues in just 5mins.. Big thing is Masha Allah is a successful party too.
nice videoanyone who likes this comment and sub me = sub back

bakwas lgti movei

For the first time, I felt like SRK is an actual actor. Thanks to whoever recruited him for the role. Alia&#39;s performance was undoubtedly mesmerizing.

best story &lt;3 it :)

best video

in the movie it shows Alia&#39;s character went through a very tough time... but just don&#39;t get it..was it really bad!!!?? She is going through nothing when compared to many youth in India.. so just one thing...her life issues were exaggerated for nothing.

He just keeps getting hotter as he ages lol love you srk 😘

it&#39;s a fab movie. loved it  alia was phenomenal too brill actress.

I loved it!

Over rated movie. Its another useless movie from Bollywood as expected. Girl faces some stupid circumstances in childhood so she  behaves like a child and opts for Therapist. Bakwas Khan is just here for Time pass to increase business

Good

just shit tatti

dear zindagi is totally flop it&#39;s super hot jst because of srk if he won&#39;t be in this sequel then definitely the Alia bhat is gonna failure with this also. so must thank full for king of khan n bolywood .

h

please tell me where is this location in goa???... cycling wala...

I love nivi

Best Film 🎥 i See IT in The Cinema

Goat and she-goat.. perfect goat combination...

Amazing movie................. Just watched it yesterday!!!!! Love you Alia and Shah Rukh!! 10 stars on 5!!!

Best movie ever
love you life really love you life thanks srk .Sir I liked this movie so much that I have been feeling like I am going to the tent door many times because there are so few problems in my life that I have been facing since childhood. Rahi hun but no answer came to my questions today I am happy after watching this movie I hope so I am very happy, I hope so in future I feel like this, love you all😊

bakwas ladki bakwas movie..

im gonna watch this movie tmrrow night.. hope this movie will not make me upset..😞

awesome movie all ppl should go theatre and watch

chutiya movie. dnt waste ur time nd money

totally bakwass movie

Such a crappy movie!! Please don&#39;t go. Alia is annoying as hell, shahrukh again becoming god (as he just can&#39;t be a normal person); not a single person who acted well. They tried desperately hard to evoke emotions in audience by playing same familiar KJ style flute. Half way down the movie you would seriously wonder does this movie has ANY STORY AT ALL or you have come to be told how hot Aaliya is and how boys line up for her despite her rudeness and indifference towards everyone? I went to watch it with really low expectations, switched off my logic button but it still managed to beat me. Hats off to the director!!! Shahrukh told media in one news conference that this movie is not a preacher instead that&#39;s EXACTLY what this movie is. Entire story/plot (IF THERE IS ANY) was probably thought BACKWARDS with certain preachings in mind.

Now onwards I won&#39;t watch any indian movies. After longtime I have watched 3 indian movies (ae dil hai, shivaay &amp; dear). All these 3 movies hugely disappointed me. Not anymore.

hey man don&#39;t cheat ur fans. sheer Waste of time and money. Omg the female lead is horrible.

Awesome movie

Very good movie. I will watch it again. I love the humour, the story, the script and everything in this movie. Good job.

appreciated boths perfomance

She is not in the position witch make har work with some one like shruk Khan this is a  problem of indin film industry any one agree with me

The best film i have seen in my entire life which is totally related to real life

really waste of money...boring

Love you srk

Awesome movie

I liked this movie...I missed SRK on a soft movie

finally srk done it ✌❤

You srk

for

just
kya chutiya movie full sar dard. Gandu director, script, story, everything. Shahrukh Khan also satiated with Umar
: A silent masterpiece

love u srk😉😉
Flop

It&#39;s just a shit movie..... waste of time and money

SRK My Best Freind
Watching Free Movie&gt;&gt; <a href="">

Can&#39;t wait to watch this in cinema today 😍

rubbish movie
I.hope that this movie.breaks all the records

You <a href="">will.be</a> happy after.watching this one if you watch it with a good heart ready to accept positive thoughts 

same old boring concept....alia did well...yet one more disappointment as usual from bollywood....

lovily

bekar hai movie....... is movie ko dekhane se tho acha hai ghar me betakar serials dekhe.....

i het aliya i love anuska
the title theme resembles fifty shades of Grey&#39;s

behkar movie

king khan is a real hero we love srk.

Shamless old man.

Shahrukh the father of Alia bhatt in da movie ...

Guaranteed class quality cinematic experience  perfect &amp; awesome movie.....with perfect performance given by all actors...Alia&#39;s best acting skill movie till date....<a href="">#SRK</a> done tremendous job....once again <a href="">#Shahrukh</a> back with wonderful dialogues  with good emotional acting skill.....really 51yr is jst a number for him....looking damm handsome in beards look.....love u &lt;3 <a href="">#shahrukh</a>......#jabrafan hogaya...!!<a href="">#DearZindagi</a>

I liked the &quot;Are you a Lebanese?&quot; dialogue....

I just came home and reviewing this movie,it was quite deep , and every viewer will relate himself/herself why we are so desperate,sad and angry,short-tempered &amp; why we all are become ALONE these days, I was seeking my answers and I have got all of them while leaving the theatre.thank you, Jehangir khan, aka Shahrukh khan.                                                                                                                                                                                           NOTE : Alia tore her well-known image in this movie,and brought her best in this one.   :)

srk is the best

wing
sharukh... same expression..same idiotic smile.. same fucking attitude like a very wise experieced fellow.. tired of him... one of the most overrated actor...so very political mentality.. paneling up with directors and producers...how can I get rid of him! even if I don&#39;t watch his shitty acting still come across posters.. his fans bark so loud..! the disgusting  part is that he thinks himself to b a teenager.. please don&#39;t spoil the lead roles just to play with young new heroines..take a note of ur age and choose some good side roles if you are confident to do justice to even those side roles..

Land movi good movi hrami moivi  best movi

Wao!!!!! Its an amazing movie 😘😘👉💝💝💝 I LOVE YOU SHAH RUKH KHAN.... 😪😘😘😘😚😚😚 AND FOR THIS MOVIE ALSO ALIA BHATT😍😘😘😘😘😚😚😚😊 AWESOME DIRECTED

WHO IS GOING  TO WATCH THIS ON FRIDAY EXCEPT ME?BATAO BATAO

good trailer

No new story !

Dear Zindagi and Pink. Two movies this year that shows Bollywood still has hope. And Shahrukh....words can&#39;t do justice to his acting. He taught us how to feel and emote, so who better than him to take us through our journey from angst to liberation? I say &quot;us&quot; because all of us would have gone through the levels of emotional despair that Alia feels. If you thought Highway and Udta Punjab was good, then you should see her in DZ. I can&#39;t believe am saying this but watch this movie for Alia and not SRK. SRK maybe the cherry but Alia is life incarnate. Wonderfully poignant movie, just watch it.

People go blindly for this movie only for SRK!!!

beyond everything going on loc ! i want to watch Ali Zafar in dear zindagi because he is one of the handsome man in asia

F U zindagi
because of alia bhatt it will be blockbuster👌👌

Another cliched shit movie
Nice

What the hell is this?

next flop movie of srk ,fans gonna cry now ,dont reply my comment before watching one week&#39;s collectin .

Alia oh shit ....
flop for sure

O Shah Rukh Bhai, what kind of work are you doing? O.O
WHAT IS THIS DAM SHIT YAAR

omg this better not be a love movie between them. thats sick.

My favorite alia bhatt

Ooh !!Really wanna watch this one .. but ryt on 25th I am going to be in London for the very 1st time !!!(not on the land for at least 6mnths)Any solutions??

very boring..

i was expecting MAIRAY DAD KHA KRTAY THAY......?

looks pretty good this movie

thankfully shahrukh is playing movies more suited to his age these days..

Can&#39;t wait to watch this movie

So does he tap her in the movie? If so i m gonna watch it

love u srk
Good film

wowwww!!!!!!!

Please someone tells me what&#39;s about ..I still not sure what its about? 😊

gauri shinde roxxx...
This movie looks good!! But the 500-1000 Rs note ban might effect the collections. People would like to save money for eating rather than watching movies.

waiting......
All d best  SRK and Alia ull gonna rock👍

Very creative ..!!

SRK is a best actor in world and he is a like family love u boss

Last movie release in 2016, so hit this movie

just wow

waiting for movie and loved that scene kabaddi one

kabadi kut kabadi kabadi
srk always proofs that life is mirical he acts too good

Eagerly waiting for this movie.. cuz it seems very refreshing n uplifting. :)

The dialogues are a little cloying. Clean frames though trying to portray a &#39;slice of life&#39;. I think SRK and Alia Bhatt are exuding a bit too much charisma for what should be a simple, understated film but it&#39;s too early to say. Fingers crossed!

after a long time a SRK movie which looks interesting.

SRK ki almost hr movie achi hoti hai... but not impressed...with this 1Raees kb aa rha hai

bakwas trailer

love you dear zindagi! srk!!!!!
supbbbb

lol.....alia with old men...........!!! bad chemistry .......father with daughter ..............!!!

so many mistakes in font editing of video

Happy birthday king

25th November is my exam and I&#39;m going to watch this..!!Thankyou SRK

who the hell extends left hand for help if he is right handed.

nice

fadu trailer and so confident movies to all people

even meaning :(
this movie is u turn for alia for sure

superr

hmmm aha haai
Alia looking younger and fresh with SRK Uncle...

what the f**k is this!! SRK instead of making shitty movies don&#39;t make movies... we all know dt u are finished. u are not anymore &quot;KING&quot; p.s father and daughter😂😂

I think Alia Bath and Srk aren&#39;t a good combination, because Alia looks too young and so crazy-cute. Srk is the King of Bollywood, emotional films are her strength, and I think Alia isnt the typ for sad, emotional and for big Lovestory like Srk Lovestorys. She is from the new and the young generation, Srk is from the older generation. I love him. But alia and he dont match together.

srk your the best... love u

it&#39;s amazing

am seeing this in theatres

I love this yrrrr 😍😍

must watch

love u sharukh
itne likes..... what do you think of this trailer main? ...one or film starring other actors is still there in life... or people will watch your life the way you like it... ..Manjhi the mountain man jaisi
So lovely
which is the best movie of srk?i have seen chak de india.any other suggestions?

happy birthday Ariyan khanna
hbd king of bollywood &#39;shahrukh khan&#39; thebest friend for fan 😍😘😘

happy birthday baadshah
happy birthday dear
shahrukh is worst actor

flop moive
It&#39;s going to be indigestible, if they have played lover role. The pair of 51 and 23 years old people, not worth it, it&#39;s crime in real life.

srk is back

so beautiful Alia and ShahRuk Khan Alia was so simple and crazy ❤❤❤

nice

bakwass

Infinitely cute face SRK, Alia charm also ...

this will be a cute movie

y alia told shah a last????

KING KHAN

looking so good

It look like an Old Truck Batra for latest 4G Mobile set. No Matching Promotion.

SRK will always be SRK! One and only! If I would have taken that beard, ppls will assume me a beggar! And look at SRK! With the same, he looks like a rockstar!

Who else thinks Shahrukh&#39;s Hair style for Dear Zindagi and RAEES is same?

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... | Main Hoon Na | Swades | Don &amp; Don 2  | Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi | Chak De! India | And Now DEAR ZINDAGI and RAEES!!! Love SRK ! Keep doing these kind of movies.

Wowww Awesome

nice

doesn&#39;t seems like it will good movie

SRK looks way too young and sexy. And what a natural acting. I keep watching this everyday!

Srk is Alia&#39;s mentor or life coach in this movie... not her boyfriend!

This couple looks absurd...Shahrukh pls work with actress who suits u not with the age of ur daughter...

alia is like &quot;kappadi kappadi&quot; 😂😂

nice trailer, I&#39;ve enjoyed seeing it much. I laughed by seeing at this trailer and enjoyed. It&#39;s fabulous, awesome, cool and laughing trailer.

looking like father and daughter

Thumbs up if u feel that this film is gonna be a blockbuster!

this movie was not loud as FAN or any other SRK movie when used to know a year before that this srk movie is realising MADE A SILENT ENTRY ON YOU TUBE

this part was film in Trinidad

waiting for this film
a car Arab
That laugh...

alia lost her boobs o.O

BIG FLOP

Dear Dharma Productions.Let Jaby React to your Trailers. He has a lot of fan following outside India and it&#39;ll just help you&#39;ll get a bigger following. <a href="">#LetJabyReact</a>

I watched this teaser already 5 times ...full of life 😀

pathetic couples -_- though i love both of them individually

Looks like a lovely clean movie from Bollywood finally

So basically they get high

Srk sound so sweet when he &quot;oh wow&quot;like if you agree. At <a href="">0:55</a>

Seeing this, people are feeling good, positivity is alive, they are staring at the sky, everything is happening because you have mummy's food in your tummy. Those who are living hungry, they never say that they love life because there is so much left to help them. Grab this chutiapa and go feed some hungry people. Meet him and your life will become lovable. Bharat Mataki Jai!
Dear zindagi background music: love u zindagiMy life: fuck u zindagi
How can anyone dislike her..so cute
Shandar 2 :(
she is too old for him.

SRK kk k k .. Without your Film&#39;s my zindagi may be become boring..

which year is this  releasing 2016 or 17

That&#39;s Seem To Be Interesting 😇😇😇

documentary

Just ostir

Beautiful trailer...srk ur d best
love it...desperately waiting for the movie

May not be happy with this..😟was expecting something better..this isn&#39;t the one i was waiting for..😣Upsetting........

looking fresh movie with fresh story

I dnt wTch this movie

&quot;SRK fan club&quot; whatsapp group (7806006446)

so now i get it. she calls him &#39;jug&#39; at the end 😂

Is there is any actress crisis in India :3

I can&#39;t wait!

srk always best hero in bollywood

SRK the bestyou&#39;r the best SRK

ALIA BHATT BEST IN THE WORLD

ANOTHER FLOP MOVIE OF SRK FANS GONNA WATHCH THIS YEAR 2016 ROCKS......||||| FLOP ACTOR OF BOLLYWOOD....

This trailer doesn&#39;t really give me any hurried urges to want to go to the cinema to watch this! then again not many srk films have that effect anymore!online job lol

Wow srk always nails it ❤️
positive vibes

Wah father daughter jodi is still a burden. No doubt Alia Bhatt is amazing in the role of mom but SRK will be in the role of hero after 20 years lol...Bachi aur uncle ki jodi bana de
After My Name is khan this is the next big film of Srk waiting :)

like wtf they look like a father and daughter relationship how do u people find this interesting!!!

karan johar shot a movie in india???

Kmn.use a blunt one.

nice

listen to alia how she says kabadi  kabdi kabdi lol flop

The only man who can look more cute and adorable than Alia 😛 😄 😊 <a href="">#SRK</a> <a href="">#DearZindagi</a>

Seeming to be common concept but guess it would be entertaining (Fan Love :- Alia &lt;3) ..!

srk an alia looking cute and a cute teaser like them

I love the music

flop  ..bcoz of aalia...........

classy trailer... wow 100000000000000+ likes

Flopp movie only plastic fans will watch

The simplicity of this movie reminded me of Piku. No unnecessary fights &amp; no crap item songs but an emotional one. Comprises of simple little things happening around us, that gonna teach us something good for sure. I&#39;m very delightful to see SRK doing such a great movie after several shitty movies like Ra.One, CE, HNY &amp; Dilwale. An old SRK is back again whom i used to be a huge fan!<a href="">#FDFSforSure</a>

movie achi hone wali h hope for the best awesome trailer

They fucking uplifting who already uplifter srk band kr chutiya

its gud to see srk acting in his natural way..waiting for this movie

What is the font used?

Finally a good director can get good out of two good actors

Now we know, its &quot;Jug&quot; that Alia screams at the end! Not &quot;Shah&quot; ! :D

father &amp; Please join me in watching my daughter's movie....😁😁😁
Finally SRK is back to choosing films for fans like us..:) Tired of Chennai Express &amp; Dilwale...

Fuck man
LOL!!! my name is Kyra too which is Alia Bhat&#39;s name in this movie😂😂😂

I wish it&#39;s gonna be viralllllllll. love u srk

this will be an awesome movie

love you zindagi , love you shahrukh.
srk you r king

This is gonna be a good one

it needs SRK laughing

Why did she fell down though the road was smooth like her cheeks?

music is so good..

not a great fan of srk but dis trailer gives a plot of a srk&#39;s good film ...wish it will

0.50 to 0.54 !!!! That&#39;s called acting !!!😲😲😲😲😲
Ali Jafar ...bhi hai movi me ...what the fuck ???

looks like her father

Shah rukh khan is so handsome and sexiest in the world....want to kiss him.....he is having so much of sex in his voice...i love you jaan💖😘

This is good to see that they use deshi location for shoot. Truly it is far better beautiful then the rest of the world to see the own beauty.Hoping It will be a great movie like kal  ho na ho.

kabadi kabadi... :D :D :D next time going to beach definitely playing it.. :D

I need SRK&#39;s glasses! soo cool..
Ye movie bilkul v superhit nehi hoga,...hit v nehi hoga... lekin &#39;&#39;Blockbuster&#39;&#39; it will definitely happen..
Positivity around SRK after a really long time !!

Just for Gauri Shinde n Alia 👍🏼 for the ddlj guy 👎🏻

This is going to be some awesome movie! Like if you agree. 😂😂

everybody put your hands up.... BczzzThe King is Back....

SRK&#39;s fake laughter is so annoying!

really lovely...😁

365❤❤
nice song foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
LOL! baqwas teaser...I&#39;m sure this movie will be also flop

7k dislikes..7 thousand devotees of mtlb have seen this

Is Alia Bhatt playing as daughter role or Heroine  to sharuk khan  ? because seriously if its daughter role movie will become hit... ok lets all just hope its like that  !

DEAR ZINDAGI WILL BE BLOCKBUSTER

nice



srk always great

Wtf is this?

cant wait anyomre 😍😍😍❤❤❤
first day first show pakka.<a href="">#FirstDayFan</a>

I liked Kabaddi wala scene in this trailer.....

simply the best.. seems silently heart touching n heart teaching to live ownself politely

Looks pretty cool...hope it turns out the same.

nice very
The BG score is a bit like Titanic title.

srk rock&#39;s

its so positive!!

its so positive!!

not srk fan..but i really like the teasers..good background music,looks like it will have fresh story and a perfect role for srk....best of luck

no offence to SRK fans, is shahrukh playing alia&#39; father here? or something else

yes ! I HAD THE 7000TH UNLIKE !!! FUCK OFF SRK !

is the movie about father and daughter relationship???

Looking very nice both
srk chutiya hehit like if you agree
take 2 is rolling guys

Finally mystery solved at <a href="">1:05</a> Alia said &quot;Jag&quot; (SRK character name in movie)... Such a beautiful chemistry between Kiaara and Jag.. Dear Zindagi Take 2 is out.. Cant wait for this movie now...Seems like November is going to be a huge treat for all.. 2nd Nov SRK Birthday &amp; 25th Nov dear Zindagi...

Love you zindagi
This kind of film is rare in India. it looks really interesting
Somebody explain to me what this movie is about... surely not a romance between Shahrukh and Alia?? :o

Alia 😍😍😍😍
She called Jag not shah

If Shah Rukh Khan has million number of fans i am one of them .if Shah Rukh Khan has ten fans i am one of them. if Shah rukh have only only one and that is me. if Shah rukh has no fans,that means i am no more on the earth.if world against Shah rukh,i am against the world.i love Shah Rukh till my last breath

This movie is gonna be a flop  coz indian audience is not mature enough to understand such brilliant movies

simple n mind-blowing trailer

#<a href="">1:05</a> So Alia shouts Jag (jahangir)  SRK&#39;s name in the movie

this is very charming, I like it

<a href="">

it will be a best movie of 2016 love u shah

superb king

I want shahrukh to work with Anurag kashyap.because he is awesome

luv the teaser frm a tamil people  i liv lot

this movie is blockbuster

the trailer is too short!  i want to see more shah rukh

great

hm so met bhe. yrr
What a stupid trailer!
which place ?????

For some reason this movie seem like finding fanny

80k likes for this kabaddi scene nd feel good moments 💕💕💕✌💕✌💕✌long days i hvnt laughed just want to watch this movie nd enjoy life💕💕💕💕💕
time&#39;s up💕💕💕💕
just wowwww!!!!

Goa + SRK = totally my kind of paradise/heavenly experience😍👌

waw srk just looked fresh n that old charm.his back.even a cameo I think he will impact in this content driven movie.

Boycott dear zindagi SRK is Pakistani. Long like Thackeray
finally a quality film meant not just to make money but to also entertain

wow !!! Amazing trailer

some good movies are coming :) looking forward to DEAR ZINDAGI, DANGAL AND RAEES &lt;3

suck😫
I want to be free.....

plz nov25 come soon
Ok, so from the trailer, i understand that alia doesn&#39;t know how to ride a cycle and strangely i am not surprised

Honestly if you look this good, of course you&#39;ll love your zindigi. Such movies are really good, but they also leave everything in the rosy picture wanting us to be like it,so much that we loose out on the main thing.I could be a geek and still love my zindigi without having to go to some road trip to feel free. Its personal. And we ought to love.<a href="">#just</a> a opinion

owsome

Who is very excited to play kabaddi with <a href="">#samundar</a>👦👦👦. , me too
i&#39;m firm waiting............................................. Dear Zindagi............................. love you SRK......................................................

best od luck for the movie

love it Shah bhai

1000 crores srk will earn this year

Love you... Dear SRK &lt;3

in love with this teaser it really bought a smile on my face...hope the movie will be good!

This movie is written ny gauri shinde then definitely i have to see this!! The movie is gonna be awesome!

Ha Ha Ha, nothing from the sea.. Ha Ha Ha, nothing or nothing found.. ha ha ha
This movie also seems to be a flop, SRK is not doing even a single interesting role, it has been going on like this for two years, it will be very difficult for SRK.
another flop of this year

SRK has reached the age of seven
whoa.... srk love u man... how&#39;s he&#39;s charming face always.. boots mee.. too😍

jai style star Allu Arjun fans srk teaser super

jai style star Allu Arjun fans srk teaser super

Style star Allu Arjun fans waiting for srk Telugu dubbed movie&#39;s
WTF is thi?s?

flope

I could watch this teaser over and over again. I can&#39;t believe that 6K people disliked this?! Why? I guess they don&#39;t know how to live life. Maybe they need an life teacher too 😉

SRK is a true human being,  simple and loving so as SALMAN,  where AMIR is little bit egoistic! Amir may think people  like the way he carry himself, seems he&#39;s someone special but come&#39;on....that over attitude ruins your personality!  Love for everyone  ♡

Srk plz come back soon with big hits...Love u lot, dont want to hear any bad comments abt u...Plz show the world what u r?

SRK is back..........

its gone a be mad aliya amazing

iam not a shahrukh fan but will watch this... great teaser sir... :)

srk is the best actor in the world only No more

Srk is playing the role of Alia&#39;s life mentor in &#39;Dear zindagi&#39; but looking so much young dat ppl are considering him as Alia&#39;s lover😍😍......Nd Den der is Salman who played the role of Anushka&#39;s lover in &#39;Sultan&#39; but looked like her father😂😂😂

Subscribe here!!!
