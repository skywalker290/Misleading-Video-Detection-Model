There is no disease in this world which is not curable . Except death . Our beloved prophet Muhammad ( pbuh) said Allah sent cure befor that disease . Allah is most merciful and most benificent . But people themselves responsible for their causes . These people forget and turn their faces from the poors though Allah has given them alot money . Our beloved Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh) said donot turn away from the poors even  if u have half dates
