What is this less in the world? Why are we sad? Why are we sad? Senorita Listen, listen to Senorita, what are we saying? [Señorita]Jamas podre (I will never)Interpretar (understand)El sentido de las palabras que me dedicas(the meaning of the words you dedicate to me)[Señorita]Pero el calor(but the warmth)De tu mirar(of your gaze)Me hace sentir como la mas bella senorita(Makes me like the most beautiful miss) [Hrithik] Senorita, this is the story of love through my eyes, this is the only language of desire, of love in the whole world, senorita [Abhay Deol] Do not look away from me, come and pass me [Hrithik – Abhay] You are in my arms gheroSamjhi na Senorita[chorus]Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paayeDuniya mein kya yeh bhi kum haiDo you come to my friend, what do you miss?

Don't find the sky La gazade Quedate cerca de miMujhko arm mein mein gheroSamjhi na senoritaChahat ke do pal bhi paaye haiDuniya mein mein yeh bhi kam hai kya haiDo ko toh aao aao kya aayeBhoole hum ho gaya hai kya senoritaSoono suno senorita kehte hain hum kya(Spanish)Jamas podreInterpretarEl sensido de las palabras. That dedicated to me But the warmth of your gaze Makes me feel like the most beautiful senorita The eyes told me the story of arms Senorita This is the language of desire, of love In the whole world senorita Don't look away from me now Come pass me You surrounded me in my arms Understanding the senorita The two pals of desire What is this even less in the world? Why do you come to my friend? Why am I sad? What is senorita? Listen, listen to what the senorita says, what are we saying? Hey senorita, every friend in your life has won my heart. Bus this much is so much (Spanish) No desvies la miradaQuedate cerca de You are surrounded by me in my armsSamjhi na senoritaWanting to meet even for a moment Why is this too little in the worldDo you come to your friend, why are we feeling sadWhat is this sorrow?Wanting to meet even a moment Why is this too little in the worldDo you come to know your friend? Are we feeling sad? what is sorrow

Con tu querer (and give meaning to my life with your love)[Farhan Akhtar] Na main samjha, na main jaana Jo bhi tumne mujhse kahaa hai Senorita Magar phir bhi, na jaane kyun mujhe sunke, accha laga hai senorita[Señorita] No desvies the glance (do not look away) Quedate cerca de mi (stay close to me)[Abhay] You are surrounded by me in my arms Samjhi na senorita[chorus] Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye duniya mein yeh bhi kam hai kya do pal Who will you come to? Do we forget what is sad? Senorita Listen listen to senorita what do we say[Señorita] Jamas podre (I will never) Interpretar (understand) The meaning of the words you dedicate to me) [Señorita] But the heat of your gaze Senorita This is the only language of love in the whole world Senorita[Abhay Deol] Don't turn your eyes away from me, come near me[Hrithik – Abhay] Encircle me in my arms Senorita[chorus] Don't look away from me even for a moment Hey senorita, every pal in your heart has won. Baat hai[Señorita] No desvies la mirada (don't look away) Quedate cerca de mi (stay close to me)[Hrithik] You surrounded me in my arms Samjhi na Senorita[chorus] Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye mein duniya Is this also a flower? Do you come to your friend, do you forget? Are we feeling sad? What is the sadness of wishing? Is this also a flower in the world? Do you come to your friend, do you forget? What is this sadness?

What&#39;s the use of PLAYBACK SINGING when these actors themselves  can sing so sweetly and awesomely ?

There is one story behind song..Hritik, Farhan, Abhay came to studio and they were given to sing the song...None of them was aware that they are going to sing the song right at that time..This is totally candid performance of all three!!!Which is awesome..

<b>It&#39;s 2023 still the magic of this song never becomes old </b>

I love myself a lot !
This movie is so real yaar

Good 
Can I know the name of the song?

This song is very sweet voice

I literally had dance this for my school concert like 10 years ago ️

very good song great actor hritik roshan ji,.abhay deol ji, farhan akhtar ji many blessings 
This is my favorite song in childhood The memories of childhood

If you want know some meaning of life and wanna live it then should watch 1. Zindagi Na mileage dobara 2. Wake up Sid 3. Ye jawani hey diwali

You can clearly see Abhay deol struggle to dance So cute!

Legends are watching this video in 2023

There is pain on the edge!
My low mood up song .Since childhood. It came 10 years ago it since thrn

Anything else that Hrithik Roshan has not done

This is my favorite song !!!! I can&#39;t express how much I  love this  !!! Hrithik , Farhan and Avoy Deol performed wonderful  !!!

Did you notice that Farhan is now also inspired by this movie?

<a href="">0:51</a>

Golden Time 
ITS 10 YEARS AND I STILL LISTEN TO THIS SONG. THE NEW SONGS DO NOT BRING THE JOY THIS SOGN DOES

Prune 
This song never gets old 

Gotta  all the bits in Spanish in the movie! Hrithik speaking Spanish to be more precise... Gotta  him in those goofy glasses and the stance right before the singer says &quot;No desvies la mirada.&quot; (Don&#39;t look away)️‍️‍️‍Also,... Did Hrithik really fall, or was this part of the scene?AND!  The little bit from Ek Pal Ka Jeena at the end... PRICELESS!!! 

Abhay Deol&#39;s voice is quite good
This song emits freshness, brightness, hope and happiness.

Fallen in love with this song. I so can relate to the movie as iam too a cancer patient so please everyone keep me in your prayers.

Excellent song
Abhay deol is much better than Bobby and sunny deol

While Farhan danced very casually, Abhay was just joking around lol. But Hrithik! Boy did he just nail the performance! All three danced very well

Anybody noticed the boys doing Hrithik&#39;s Ek Pal Ka Jeena hook step??? What a funny, cute little addition! This is a lovely movie with great songs and a well-written script. Simply lovely!

Kon kon 2023 meh e gana sun raha hea
I heard this song when I was in 3 class i didn&#39;t know the name or what movie it was from stumbled across this many years later it&#39;s still as good as it was before.

the  two very old my fav songs &quot;Senorita Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot; and &quot;Pyar ki Pungi&quot;

Hrithik is on next lvl

Farhan Akhtar danced very naturally without overdoing it . I feel Hrithik Roshan overdid it a lot in this film including this song with his dancing . I pretty much didn&#39;t like his acting in this film .

Kl mera exam mind fresh
what a beautiful song, greetings from Peru
Wow what a beautiful composition I couldn&#39;t live without commenting here

hritik is a great dancer!

Which dance is this?  Is this flamenco?

This song is having a seperate fan base...may be we Indians not understand the lyrics of this Spanish girl but it&#39;s so amazing...

No Spanish version in senorita from zindagi na milegi dobara.

Hrithik Roshan is at the crossroads because he stole Shahrukh Khan's style.

Na maim samja na main jana :- me to my english teacher

Neither do I understand, nor do I know Whatever you have said to me, Senorita But still, I don't know why I feel good after hearing it, Senorita You surrounded me in your arms Do you understand, Senorita? If we can get even two moments of desire Is this too less in the world? Two moments Come on, let us get lost, do we feel sad, Senorita, listen, listen, Senorita, what are our eyes saying, through the eyes it is the story of desires, Senorita of desire, there is only one language of love in the whole world, Senorita, don't turn your eyes away from me now. You surround me in my arms, don't you understand, Senyorita? Is it too little in this world to get even two moments of love? Come for two moments, let's get lost, forget about us. Is it sad, Senyorita? Listen, listen, Senyorita, what do we say, whatever moment? Bitahey Senyorita, every moment you have won my heart, this is just a small thing, you have surrounded me in my arms, don't you understand, Senyorita? If we can meet even two moments of desire, is this too less in the world? Come for two moments, let us get lost, is it a sorrow?
