Off topic but I always loved how effortlessly Teena caught the scarf.

That duptta scene actually meant &quot;ja behn tera red flag terko mubarak&quot; 

I try to forget, but not

Tinggi manusia karna otak main to ok

The first movie to make me cry

In 2024 I still cry for this scene. I dont know why this is so touching. I was only 5 or 6 years old the first time I saw this scene and I cried at that time. How could I feel the emotion at the very young age? LOL

Srk his eyes . He is a energetic guy



This generation never get this type of movie still  seen this movie

Pyar sirf ek baar nahi hota hain anjali

Heart Touching Scene ️️

SRK

Nggak mudah loh melewati hari demi hari untuk menjauh dari orang yg kita cintai, dan memberikan ruang kpd org yg kita cintai utk bersama orang lain. Sangat nggak mudah.

Watching 2024, this scene jst

Rahul hi

MissuVikramjikiran

No other movie can never ever hold the emotions of this scene in the whole Bolly industry.Bollywood just peaked here &lt;3

Do pal ka khabo ka karwa 

Aku pun pernah rasa cinta pertama tapi dia memilih wanita lain hingga kini 2kali suda aku kahwin namun nama pilih dia tidak kan sekali

Rahul has FOMO

Bye Rahul next junum milenge

I have exactly the same outfit which I wore on the 1st boat party at university 

I don&#39;t know why people doubt whether Rahul really loved Anjali. This scene says everything to me about his deep feelings for Anjali. Running after train, telling her needs her and he will fail his exams without her, and not being able to look away, even after the train left the platform. He also never forgot about her because her last name was the 1st thing that came to mind when he played Neelam&#39;s game with his daughter and was always practicing basketball. He also had tears in his eyes when he saw her again after several years in 2nd half.   He also didn&#39;t develop romantic feelings for another pretty woman and showed no interest in seeing another woman after Tina died so I don&#39;t think he fell for Anjali because she was more beautiful and attractive in 2nd half. Rahul only realized the extent of his feelings for Anjali after seeing her again in 2nd half.  Srk and Kajol showed their heartbreak perfectly in this scene.

Very Heart touch scene tears in. My ears in last scene. Awesome milestone movie.

Can&#39;t stop crying 

Arhanuddin sayang selalu padamu sayang(numberwan)

I really cry for this scenes

is video ko dekh kar aaj apne best friend ki bahot yad aa rahi hai

Is this the same train where Kajol ran  to SRK in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge

This scene always hold my breath 

Tina could have told Rahul that anjali loves him 

I love this movie

The way srk realizes Anjali will never come back and the violin starts is just perfect...no matter whenever I see idk why I cryThis scene is a masterpiece

After watching this movie I became Shahrukh fan.. and trust me I watch this movie in 2010 and after that I watch his all movies.. before that I was always thoght why so many people like him.

This movie outstanding 

Recollecting it.........     without notice

SRK deserves to be King of bollywood..

My all time favourite..

<a href="">1:48</a> to<a href="">1:56</a> 

Forever fav



tbis scene is so special for me. I remember, i have already watched the movie for so many times. But once, many mamy years ago, i just sat in front of TV ans started to watch this movie , suddenly when Rahul turned back and said &quot;Shit, Anjali, Anjali, dont leave&#39; , i started ti cry so deeply and so painfully. Which btw, i have never cried for or due to movies. At that momet, i understood that, i have grown up myself and this movie will not be in my childhood any more , but will be my memories , and i will change , as Rahul and Anjali&#39;s lives change suddenly after this train leaves . I don&#39;t know , will anyone understand me or not, all i want to say is that, as she left, the same way, my childhood left and never came back ..

<a href="">0:51</a>











<a href="">1:12</a> Emotional scene

<a href="">0:30</a> Memorable scene

I hate Tina because she knows and she feels from first that anjeli loves rahul but Tina broke their relationship.. how stupid she is

This movie and these 3 actors what bring Bolywood to global stage. As non Indian, I still admired, Shahruk khan, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee untill now.

Evergreen movie superb movie

Ma kolfi Sy boht zeyada payar Karti hu magr usy bol nhi pati hu, or wo kesi or Sy payar Karta a

Bro this scene proves that Rahul saw Anjali as his dearest ,closest &amp; best friend. He didn&#39;t see her as his gf or love. He did love her but as a best friend. He loved Tina as a bf. He didn&#39;t ignore Anjali for Tina! He just saw Anjali as his best friend and Tina as his true love. He didn&#39;t even know that Anjali loved him! You can see the pain in his eyes when Anjali was leaving. Anjali didn&#39;t even say correctly where she was going. She stopped contacting with Rahul &amp; Rahul couldn&#39;t find her anymore! After Tina died, Rahul fell in love again but with Anjali! But it&#39;s true that Aman deserved better.



best seen 

Srk king of falling in love 

Main ladki to nhi hun lekin phir bhi mai anjali ka dukh jerur samjh sekta hun 



Sometimes what our heart truly wants is in the deep inside of the our heart ,we realise it in critical nd choosable conditions . Life

This  has  nothing  to  do  with  the   horrible  life   Today 

Like Anjali or other girls/boys never fall in love again after having this kinda pain into their heart. Actually I can&#39;t describe Anjali&#39;s pain, but may Allah it never happens with whom, who has a soft heart please 

This scene was so tear-jerking

3.07

srk srk srk srk srk srk die hart fan

Their acting .. That&#39;s why they are running nowdays also .. new commers should learn from them

The difference between us is I ignored other for you &amp; you ignored me for others :)

Omg this is very painful! Makes me cry.

Payar and dosti m hamesha payar he jitta hain real life mlost my friend forever.. where ever you are stay blessed and achieve what ever you want.. just want to say &quot;tujhe yad na mera ayi kisi ab Keya khana?&quot;

Hi

this scene always make me cry. how emotional this movie

Indian No 1 emotional movie SRK

Rahul to Anjali.

Kisah kite bersama allahuakbar asma allah he kien.. Sejen.. Arep.. Hahaha..

Es film ko ajj tak dekhne ki himmat nhi hoti bhut hi emotionaly h

Fghc

When I first watched this scene I cried so hard

Love you so much more than ten thousand helicopter , srk and kajol

2nd Day....200️️️️️ so Laal dupatta.... Lagee tu batanaa

Md.sahil

Very emotional scene same situation I faced when I realised I love someone but his already in the relationship with another

While watching my parrents why are u crying

I really believe saccha payar hamesa harta hi haii

Vaay nə gözəl günlər var idi internet yox idi ama həyatımız gözəl idi

I love the way this story is made! Every single scene.. like she threw her dupatta towards Tina which is the only color she has ( rest of her dress is white) like she gave all her color in life (Rahul) to her …literal swag to the film team!!

&quot;Всё в жизни бывает&quot;

I love you Kajol ,I miss you.

I really cried in the last scene after see SRK&#39;s eyes

Kuch kuch hota hai....tum nahi samjhogi....

And Then Happiness

really sad to watch it.

This was the same year when I introduced one of my female friend to my guy friend, and they both fell for each other, sidelining me totally. I disconnected from both together and realised I lost two best friends at once, I was in huge depression and this was in 1998, when this movie released. So this scene made me cry a lot as identified with Kajol&#39;s character.However, as karma would have it, these two so called friends eloped and married, the  poor girl who enticed my rich friend with her sweet talks and looks threw in a divorce case and asked for a hefty alimony in just four months after a court wedding. That is when I realised that God blessed me with sanity by decluttering these people and Karma gave them a lesson.

2005 me bhi wahi feel hua, ab 2023 me bhi fir seemotional

Ya Allah lama lama ikhlas gw

Even though SRK is my most favourite actor but I really don&#39;t want him to end with AnjaliIn childhood we love RahulIn 20s we understand him It&#39;s better if she choice Aman 

Still now this scene brings tears from my eyes.....



Its very hard to बीयर that situaton Losting a freind

<a href="">3:07</a> Those who say SRK can&#39;t act...Just show them this clip and let them know what real acting is.......

अब ऐसी फिल्मे कहा बनती है

Kon kon hai jo 2023 me bhi is movie ko dekh rha h

I cannot stop my tear

nice dil

My childhood memories My all time favourite movie

Legends of 90s so heart touching scence  . All time Blockbuster movie

From future 2050 watching grand kids and remembering some resemble stories with this scene and tear on my eyes

Masterpiece 

This scene is only relatable for those person who only faced it in their life. Yeah, feelings can fade the beauty of friendship.

When  he  said ,  aur  mujhe  tumhari   zaroorat  nahi  hai  ,   I  literally   cried

I’ll never forget this movie

Mantap sayang ku mlm jga cntk

This scene is well crafted, When Rahul was saying he doesn&#39;t care and all, He thought of he said these She&#39;d stay. But when the train horn was pulled Rahul realised she really is leaving.

रोज़  तो  तुम  हारते  थे  ,  तो  तुम  क्यूँ   जा  र  ई  हो  ?अबे  तो  तुम  उन  स्टूपिड  लड़कियों  के  पीछे  भागना  बंद  करो हाँ  ऐ.... ऐ....ई.....

Mantap sayang ku sore jga cntk

It hit him hard when she left  you never knew what you had until you loose it

Us din ye ahsas hua sayad mai rahul aur anjali ke bich aa gayi thi . Damn line ...............

My fvrt movie

<b><a href="">3:07</a></b>Thats what you call emotion, you cant beat srk in that

Masih disini

FREINDSHIP

When Anjali throws her red cloth towards Tina.... what&#39;s that mean?

Mujha chodaka ja ra ho,but ma tha timro lagi akho theia tada bata tme na vatha ma tha thau tha k  desh 13 barsa agadi chodi sakta,cricket khelkako khla herxa,tme gayi paxi,timro momi la herera muska maskakunuthau aba khale alhikathi va ni kushi dinxa,bhaine haru gayi sako,umm college lagxa vanara timro mamu la akho vare ashu parnu vako theio,asthi audha hasnvo vako theio herera,but igorned garak pne hoina,toucher vako theio paap naglas,i rescept ur mom, mero late vo sab kura,feri tme la wait nagarako pne hoina,but yar bad luck,but herna tatro vara pne ash lagxa yar,walla.

After going anjali rahul was happy with tina.. But anjali she completely changed..

Did she leave her education for a guy/friend like him? Seriously? Nibba Nibbi shit!



It does not happen exactly in the real world !

Very Hart teaching istory I m very emotional love you sharukh Khan and love you kajol Rani Mukherjee  RJ Army Lover ️🇮🇳 love you indian Army 🇮🇳

Tina me anjali ka live cheen liya, bhagwaan ne uski life cheen li... Rahul ne anjali ka mazzak banaya aur bhagwaan ne uski life ka mazzak bana diya.. KARMA HIT BACK

My favourite scene 

This movie, especially this scene, is very much related to my school life. Miss those days. 

My favorite movie 

So am I

Just look the eyes of srk <a href="">3:08</a>

And the time when Teena realised that Rahul loves Anjali.....so muchBecause &quot;pyar ek dosti hai&quot;

Iss film ka best scene Jo dil hilarious deta hai



Kiya pary ya Mary I don&#39;t  on only ding dong that&#39;s its

This scene clearly explains that we only understand the importance of someone in our life when we are separated from that person but then it is too late.Only only rare the cases  are where we get back the chance or the person again in life which is almost impossible.️

I miss you yaar wo time ke liye 

In this movie the biggest sacrificer is. Tina but in Real life of srk is man Enocently said many thing in this movie . Which helps our 90s Batch kids on Thier Journey of Life

The best film ever made

Even shakib al hasan cried while watching this scene

This movie made me angry He didn&#39;t truly love herHis daughter actually found a mother He forgot about his &quot; best friend&quot;



How perfectly their voice blend

Rahul + tina ++ anjali = Love

LOL her dad’s health is bad and he’s like “who cares, why are going?” 

There. Rsaer. Bas. Vadi. Sanajay. Dks

Kon bhool skta hai ye movie kon .. ye to meri bachpan ki yaadein hai.. yadeein.. L.G ka rangeen tv..kodak camera..polo tshirt ️

Izin share booss

this movie is Amazing bhai ye tho super movies hai

The absolute look of understanding that passed between Anjali and Tina sends chills down my spine, they were never each other&#39;s enemies and never wished each other ill. Just wrong timing

I am loner with no friends or lover. I can understand the pain of seperation. I cried multiple times to this scene. But no one sees me crying

Miss those watching movies in ,,, nostalgia

Jab Dil tuta hai to awaj nhi hoti,

How did two women fall for this jerk. I don&#39;t know!! ( I love SRK but Rahul&#39;s character was a jerk certainly)

Так я плакла

I faced the same,Love bear all things and sacrifice 



Her eyes : Rahul I am going home, Please stop me, I want to be with you as we used to be..!! Its hard for me to see you with someone else..!! Have a good life Rahul, I will miss you forever..!!

Ky daour tha wo jb esi movie bnti thi aankhe bhar aai yar   ......kon rota h kisk liye yar                                                             ankho me aansu aaya kuch apna yad krke

Today even in 2023  this is the best emotional scenes by any movie in Indian cinema..best scene..

Same situation with me

If Tina is not there Anjali would propose Rahul ️....

Always crying  whenever I see this schene



Tina Should Feel BAD  Bcoz she came between Rahul &amp; Anjali 

<a href="">

Omg very emotional seen this isGoosebumps 

yar scene dekh  kar rona aaaaaata hain

after one year before I used to cry for my best friend and now I m crying for my love who left me without any reason everthing is temporary nothing is permanent chahe Wo  friendship Ho ya relationship

But I miss you yaar ️

Bhai acting mein koi actor takkar nhi de sakta srk ko️️️

Chod diya use...kyunki main Teena ban na nhi chti thi

reality of man, they usually  fall for woman&#39;s appearance but they get trauma  they suddenly need woman&#39;s who truely understand them.

The day of pathan m watching this scene and cry for his fans today I realised fan k power kya hoti h mohabbat k aage nafrat kbhi nhi Jeet sakti h

2023 love you khan

I hated Tinaaa, I just hated her

️️

In my childhood I always used to hold my Tears, During this scene. So that i don&#39;t embarass myself infront my Parents. LOL :)

King of Bollywood

This movie sha....my childhood 🇳🇬

Not the best acting, but this is still so romantic 

can this scene get any old...

90&#39;s kids please like 

Rani mukherjee just 18 yo on this movie.

A very flawed story. The character of Rahul is not even likeable. He was an ass. He went after the chamri and only wanted Anjali later because his wife had died and now Anjali looked more attractive. So Rahul can have whatever he wants when it suits him? Realistically, Anjali should have married long before or at least stay with the other guy. Stupid film, nice songs though.



Who watching this masterpiece in 2023 january

When ever I saw rani mukharji i always see she came between someone relationship 

After this incident I and anjali were met with with husband.......this is happening in only in film only....

I cried like a hell when I watched this movie for the first time

The great scene of Bollywood.

My childhood memories  love 20s bollywood from South india.



What does it signifies when Anjali throws her dupatta ??

He never loved her hmmmm she was only second fiddle

Ох севгини дўстлик деб қабул қилган бечора қалбим, чушинганингда эса кеч бўлди.

childhood memory ...realy emotional

What if Teene didn&#39;t die? Rahul will not even remember Anjali. What if Anjali&#39;s appearance hadn&#39;t change? Rahul will not fell for her!

Decades later and this scene gets me every time I watch it

Stop cutting onions mom please. 

Kajol bgitu cantik dan  peran nya bgus sy trus ulang nonton nya

No one can compete with shahrukh khan in Bollywood. Excellent emotional expressions he will completely involve into the role and can do any role like Kamal Hassan in South industry.

Beautiful



After 22 years miss you yash

This scene just shows Rahul realising his best friend is leaving him, but I wonder how when Tina and him got married, they never tried to search for Anjali at all? Tina also realises she might be in between Rahul and Anjali but she still chose to marry Rahul and only tried to reunite Anjali and Rahul despite not knowing if Anjali is already taken or not. While Anjali is having trouble forgetting her first love after so many years…. I am sorry I can’t. I just can’t- How is this even considered a beautiful story? This whole thing is a mess and I am so bothered with so many things!

<a href=""> movement behind the chip

OMG beautiful

কেবল লজ্জা, ঘৃনা বা ভয় নয় ভালোবাসা থেকেও মানুষ দুরে চলে যায় কখনো দ্বিগুণ গতিতে।

Kchch Kchch Hain Pyaar Meiin Congrats tsar thanks for letting me help thanks 

Always cried during this scene

️️️️️

Tina knew at that point when Rahul started chasing the train that he actually loved Anjali first but didn’t realise until she was going.. he only realised it himself.



One of my favourite movie

Very emotional scene 

Mujhe aaj v wo fairwell party yaad ata hai jab ham apni jaan se bichde rhai. Isi tarah hamdono ek dusre se lipat kar rooye thai..us tym kisi ke pas phone v nahi tha..or aaj v ham fb insta me usse dhundte hai...but afsos aaj 16 year ho gaya aaj tak nahi mili wo

When I watched this scene for the first time, never in my entire life did I think I would cry so much from a movie scene lol. One of My favorite movies

I really like this scene

Sam &amp; Bharti ️

<a href="">3:17</a> is .............painful

i love this movie..  

No word ....  Just .....

Kar diya karo

wow

I don&#39;t know hindi but i understand

<a href="">0:42</a>

This scene never gets old

This gen kids won&#39;t understand the worth of this movie when they are watching and praising movies like student of the year , kalank , Kabir singh etc.... Only 90s kids would understand the value of movies like kkhh ,kabhi kushi kabi gham, kal ho na ho, etc

KJo love his moviesKuch kuch hota haiKabhi khushi kabhi ghamKabhi alvida na kehnaKal Ho Na HoYeh jawani hai deewaniAe Dil hai mushkil️

They did Anjali dirty with that ugly wig 

<a href="">1:40</a> All living creatures wants to be remembered. That&#39;s why Anjali threw her signature towards Tina.

Those eyes in tears...  Remainds myself

When his earlier movie Dil To Pagal Hai was released, I was extremely disappointed when his best friend Karishma who&#39;s in love with him leaves and goes away when he falls for Madhuri.  Shahrukh and Karishma looked so good together, did a lot of masti.  She says that she&#39;ll be back, but she doesn&#39;t get his love even when she returns.  I had written a letter to Shahrukh telling him how I wished he had fallen in love with Karishma in the end.  Then this movie released with a similar story but different heroines.

Never love a girl again 

Jab koe apna chahne wala choed ke jata hai to pura jivan barbad ho jata hai.

Tina&#39;s character is super selfish in this movie. She saw with her own eyes the true love between Rahul and Anjali. She even knew it. Yet as a good friend of Rahul she made no attempts to make Rahul realize where his true love is. Instead she selfishly married Rahul for her own happiness throwing Anjali&#39;s love under the bus. Only at her death bed, she is asking her daughter to do something which ideally she should have done long before.

Kiya chiz hai Sharukh khan

So cool dailogue..yaar wat a chemistry...grt actors.......dailogue delivery...anjali

<a href="">0:43</a>

Oh i love this movie

Still alive in 2022️

When I see this sence so it began to happen magic in my whole body  and not able to stop tear from my eyes...... So painful.

Bolywod se char aye hain koun sa movie hai inke 

Best scene till now.. can&#39;t stop my 

<a href="">22:22</a> ON THE CLOCK AND THIS MADE ME CRY BECAUSE I MISS MY TRUE LOVE ALOT TODAY

هفضل اعيط ف كل مرة اسمع فيها المشهد ده بجد

<a href="">

Only who understands bond of friendships can understand this scene, created such a beautiful way !!

Movie is shit but this is a legendary scene

Why does this scene always make me cry even being a boy

This scene never gets old. Always get goosebumps and teary eyes. Anjali️Rahul

Hollywood-Rose and JackBollywood-Kajol and Srk.

One of my favorites movies. When I watched this as an adult made me realize the whole situation was kinda toxic lol

Rahul is a play boy type of a guy who fell for Tina&#39;s appearance. He married her thinking that&#39;s his true love. It&#39;s something happens in common in this world. Two good looking people falling for eachother and getting married right away. Thats the main reason for most of divorce cases nowadays. He was happy with her and had a baby too. But there was only LOVE between them. It was only romance. No FRIENDSHIP no fights no fun just a boring relationship. He thought he took the right decision. But in deep he&#39;s missing his best friend. He was clueless and his feelings for Anjali were vanishing by the time. But it was like a rubber ball under water. His inner feelings for Anjali started showing when they meet at the camp. First I thought Rahul is selfish to get both girls. And felt sorry for Aman. But then I  realized that there&#39;s no reason to hold a relationship when the partner is in love with someone else. Love is blind. 

I have seen this movie.. i don&#39;t know like 1000 times... But yesterday I saw this movie after a long time on Netflix I just got emotional to this scene ( I don&#39;t usually cry while watching a movie) but idk what happened yesterday my eyes were red &amp; I was into tears... when Anjali leavs Rahul and he don&#39;t even know why this is happening... I felt that..this is year 2022, yet &quot;Kuch kuch hota hai&quot; is my fav movie and it will always be ️

SRK 

Ys

I were on place of Anjali i would definately  choose  Aman because for me self respect is more important than love anjali was rahul second option after tina

Comments and video both r awesomeKon kon chahata hai k kuch kuch hota hai 2     bane️

Even after 22 years so I love u

05/07/2022 Still it&#39;s a very imotional Moment Tears come out

What I can understand from this movie is that Rahul really love Anjali , there are many hints like this train scene and Tina&#39;s letter also when Rahul and Anjali meet again in summer camp and when they were playing a game with I love you scene is best example which shows that he love her from beginning

This is my one of the favorite movie

Sonuaaaaaa

Almost 24 years and this scene breaks my heart everytime. It&#39;s really difficult to leave your best friend. 

Kajol is a legend all her movies was blockbusters and Brilliant we need her to make more movies in 2022.

️



SRK longevity is insane. A true legend.you&#39;ll always remember as the best.Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩

Wowww 

Still i am crying after this scene showing again :- 

The golden days  of bollywood.Kuch kuch hota hai.Pyar karne ke bd sach mai kuch kuch hota hai.

Sedih

SRk super roal Kajol

Rani played a legendry role 

Kajol is Black GirlBut Kajol Acting is very Perfect

Selfles.bhagwan.ke.bharose.aur.koi.maksad.bhi.nahi.

xRx



Really good 

Man.hari.

Look at the outstanding acting of srk     at the end.. his eyes welled up..so emotions acting

Whenever I watch this movie always comes tears  in my eyes lovely seen

This scene

I feel deep feeling on kajol shawl why i dont know️️️

SRK Fan

Such  me  hear  touching  situation..god  ..face  to  dificult

Never come between two best friends 



Is this scene possible without kajol

<a href="">3:09</a> This is the moment Rahul suffered his very first heartbreak!

Facts =You will watch/remember and watch this scene and cry but it&#39;s too late. You feel the value only after you lose him/her.

Tina had realized that Anjali loved Rahul right then and there, but she was in a quandary. if she rejects Rahul then rahul will be heartbroken, but if tina tells rahul that anjali likes her then it will bring down Anjali&#39;s self-esteem as a woman. meanwhile tina herself may still love rahul but in different feelings before knowing this fact

Tina looks after and keeps the red sari so that her child can take care of it, it&#39;s really amazing



Mene jindagi me  Amitabh Bachchan ko &quot;manjile apni jagah he raste apani jagah&quot; song pe originally hard touching  imotional  expression dekhe the or ek bar fir is film me Shahrukh khan ko.Verry genius.

Flim indrustry me ye pal hamesa yad rahegi...

Yup. I still cry every single time. 

Yr ye kya bnaa diya tha 90&#39;s ma.....just amazing



My favorite film

I 1st watched this when I was 17.. Now I&#39;m 40.. And this scene still make me shed tears..

Kutch Kutch Hota Hai... Abhi tak koi samaj nahi paya ki ye Kutch Kutch Kya Hota Hai??



Anjali and Rahul are never ending emotions of bollywood

i am that kind of person who likes kuch kuch hota hai more than dilwale dulhaniya le  jayenge

Oh gosh.. this scene 

Rahul realize he love his child friend not rani

My favourite movie.

Movies of that time 

Childhood memories ️

I am really very obsessed with angli&#39;s character in this film...i wish if karan johar make part 2 of the same movie then i want him to make 2 hero&#39;s and one heroine just like in this movie there were two girls....and i want him to cast me as on of the two male actors️

This masterpiece never forget everyone watching movie

The films of these two kings will remain in my heart forever

Vry emotional  swsame 

It&#39;s 2022 and these moments are immortal ️

Watching it again on 18th April 2022Masterpiece movie

Iam crying after watching tis sceneanybody here to wipe my tears

There&#39;s a deleted scene where Karan wanted to start the movie with Tina in an emotional state at her wedding. She was aware that she had little time left. And remember the scene on Friendships Day where Mr. Malhotra explains to Anjali that his wife passed away a long time ago, it makes sense that Tina could&#39;ve inherited a genetic trait from her mom that puts a lot of strain on her during a pregnancy. So Tina knew she wasn&#39;t going to be alive to care for her daughter. Other producers decided against the scene that&#39;s why it was cut.

R AOnR Jan

Yeah dono real life me bhi bohot acche dost thhe..  Lekin Ajay Devgan ke wajah se sab khatam Ho gaya

Even I to ..

Really a heart touching moment

<a href="">0:44</a> song name?

20 th brlalu,,ngeling masi mbalih ne ,,, emg legend film e ne 

Pain of one side love...90s it&#39;s just movie but now I realize Anjali feelings 

Anjeli hijab mu ku simpan

Anjeli......

King cobra



Just for a man, she didnt complete her college degree. She wasted her parents money just for a man. Lol

Sobbing 

<b>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</b> :- Kajol Diserved ShahRukh but he went for Rani Mukharjee.<b>Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum</b> :- Rani Mukharjee deserved ShahRukh but he went for Kajol.

Sedihnya saat Anjeli mencampakkan hijab nya.....

Sedihnya Anjeli......harus pisah sama seorang sahabat kecilnya......

Sometimes I feel Shahrukh is selfish, he wants both kajal and raani, i loved Kajol&#39;s role, many scenes of Kajol made me cry

My heart is broken 

Igjhi️️️️️️

<a href="">2:36</a>-last Power of background score with pure and soulful acting makes it so emotional Everyone must be crying

Anjali kahaan rahegi it&#39;s your decision Shahrukh Mujhe to Mehdi ghamandi lagtaa hai shaayad yun kah lo Anjali ko chhorr ek din Tina ke saath tum aur Shayad Mehdi bhi Mujhe chhorr kisi aur ke saath kharraa hai he has no emotions I like Memnon vo jaisa bhi hai Roxxanne ka Patee hai.

very emotional the seen 

Omg ️

Jo JO 2022 mei dekh rahei hei wo lagends Hazeri Lagai   ...............

Kuch kuch hota hai ki ye scene bohot emotional thi

Going back to the time when trains were red.

Ro para main...

Rahul  Anjali

best scene ever make i miss those day i am crying

I can&#39;t stop crying

Childhood love️

Awesomeness

अंजली और टिना और राहुल की लवष्टोरी मरते दम तक नहीं भुलुंगा

Even after 20 year&#39;s,this scene still bring tears into my eyes 

I&#39;m crying I&#39;m crying I&#39;m crying 

Tina knew they loved each other but were too honorable to hurt her yet she deliberately kept them apart which in my opinion is selfish and inhuman....Tina knew Rahul never really loved but still chose to punish all of them and making everyone miserable.

Heart touching

I cant count how many time i watched this movie years ago..and stil i loved it though it s been yearssss ...

23 years ago but 

2022kon hai?this story was amazing

Even after 23 years,this scene still bring tears into my eyes

I literally start crying whenever I see this scene ... Only true friendship can relate this scene ..

This movie has something in it.. Now also it brought tears in my eyes.. All time favorite

My favourite couple kajol n shahrukh khan ️️️



Even afyer 24 years

Such emotional sence

<a href="">

2022 k k dekhcho???

Pehle ki ur aaj ki ldkiyon me bhot hi mamuli sa fark h,,,,, phle ki ldkiyan dard sah leti thii dukh jhel leti thi,,,pr dusron ko dard kabhi b,,,janbujh kr nhi diya krti thii,,,, but aaj ki ladkiyon ka toh moto hi dusron ko dard ur takleef dena h,,,,,

 it&#39;s give me great imotion to watching this seen 

Still in 2022 is hearts touching 

Really heart touching seen  

One of the thing i got to understand from this Movie is that... Rahul only started loving the girl when she is too hot or beautiful like Tina or Anjali in second phase or when they started leaving him ... And that&#39;s the Nature of Every Men and Boy!!!!.....

&quot;<a href="">1:17</a>&quot; Am I the only one whose eyes are teary after listening to this BGM? 

Crying 

Yeh scene meri life me real me ho gya  i can relate how much it hurts

Ye hoti thi filme ️

2022  the Epic Scene ️

&quot;Love doesn&#39;t claim possession, but it gives freedom.&quot;Rabindranath TagoreHere Anjali doesn&#39;t claim possession of Rahul rather leaves him at Tina&#39;s disposable. Love demands sacrifice, Anjali does that, she is the genuine lover. So at the end she smiles.

I hv seen this movie n number of times

Kajol and shah rukh️️️

Who are here to watch this masterpiece  in 2022 ️

Hi by

On..on..



A throw back to some memories

Amazing

But i don&#39;t like the end. Kajol shouldn&#39;t marry srk as he got feelings for her by seeing her beauty that&#39;s too after Tina&#39;s death.. Whether tina alive he can&#39;t and won&#39;t marry Anjali

Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani......

Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani......

Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani.......

Hijab itu punya Rani.......Hijab itu punya Rani......Hijab itu punya Rani......

Cerita singkat nya......Kajol mencampakkan hijab garis garis tiramissu Tina.......

Sedih nya cerita Sharukh Khan ini......Antara Tina dan Kajol tak habis habis........Akhirnya si Kajol mencampakkan hijab garis garis Tina.........

Di indonesia Anjeli tetap pakai hijab hijab Kajol..........

Kalau di indonesia.....Kajol itu tetap sama aman........Rahul tetap sama Rani.........

I&#39;ll miss u K

Even after all these years I still remember him

when i was child i feel happy for Anjali get Rahul in the end, but now when i adult i feel bad that she choose Rahul over Aman 

Main meri best friend ko kal I love you bolne wala hun I am so nervous 

Good 

Whenever I see this scene I cry

Anjali&#39;s dress is same as like my college  wahi kahani chal raha kuch kuch hota hai 

this scene never ever fails to bring tears in my eyes :)can just never be over of the goosebumps that this film gives me everytime i watch it. FAV FOR A REASON ️

Still with tears in my eyes





The real love 



Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but FRIENDS are for life!!-Phoebe

That &#39;shit&#39; from SRK when he realises this is really happening

The most painful scene...even after all those years I am yet to come upon another heart breaking scene like thus one. I could feel all that needed to be said between the 3 of them. Anjali knowing that she has to go away so that she hides her feelings and avoid heartbreak, Teena knowing why Anjali is leaving but she can&#39;t do anything for her friend, Rahul finally coming to an awakening of the deep connection he and Anjali share. This is the best movie in its genre and given the standards of those days, I&#39;ve ever seen. It has everything.

I cries like a baby during this scene

Just Love 

Now a days i am in this situtaionreally pain apna love apna bestfrnd kisi ko dena bht mushkil hogya ha bht 

Please Subtitles.

Amazing 







srk perfect in all roles.And happy 56th birthday of srk..today..

Kkhh ..Bible of love....

Though  rahul and tina are the couple in the movie... i think kajol is the main charector and reason of the sucess of these movie

,

কি কারনে ওড়না ছুড়ে ফেলে এইভাবে চলে যাচ্ছে কিছুই বুঝলাম না Really so bad স্টেশনের ৭০% লোক শুধু তাকিয়ে থাকতে পছন্দ ও ভালোবাসে।বিশ্বাস না হলে রেল স্টেশন বা বাস স্টেশনে গেলে দেখবেন

Sonny tsanglao. If you are reading this. I have loved you and take my love for you till my grave. I may be bad but I truly loved you. You know it. Pyar is not always about staying together.

Pardon faîtes quelques choses

Pourquoi il y&#39;a pas les films indiens en version française

I am crying while watching this scene

बँबई माफिया का सारा पैसा,  पाकिस्तान के नियंत्रण मे जाता है .....फिर, सितारों (Hero/Heroin) के भेष मे छिपे जिहादीयोँ को पहुँचता है...जो हिन्दूस्तानी भावनाओं को फिल्मों मे डालकर,  जिहाद का जहर पूरी दुनिया मे बाँटते हैँ।

JAwani yaad Dila di   my BRTH 1984

Agar tina nahin marti to rahul ko anjali se pyaar hi nahin hota. This is called true love?

Kya moment tha

We all know Tina was selfish in this movie  that&#39;s why she get the reward of death at the end 

Chup rh pana,sob ki baas me nhi hota...️️

Rona ata ha bhot 

Kajol is best actress in Bollywood

2021 still watching 🇵🇭

<a href="">1:30</a> rani caught the love in anjali&#39;s eyes but Rahul can&#39;t

Just bcoz anjali use to dress up like tom boys rahul didnot have feelings for her. Suddenly when he sees her in feminine get up(saree+long hair) his affection for her arises. What a shit. I feel sorry for anjali. She should have chosen aman. She deserved a person who loves her for who she is.

nothing is more important than self respect to me,,I

I watched this movie in 2016. It&#39;s been my favorite Bollywood movie since.

This secen is very emotional my favourite film

Yar ye Pyar be bas chiz hai

আমি খুব কেঁদেছি



Every time I see this my heart melts what a great movie Everyone knows what a one side love means ️That pain you have to hold in your hearts regardless others know it or not This scene resembles that

Kisi ki khusi ke lie bhut kuch chodna pdta hai kya ehi pyar ka mtlb hai

que pena que Anjhali se fue

Bollywood ne 1980s kids ko pura bigaad dia hai… actually this is a super stupid movie…

50 Years later;My son :- “Dad who was Shah Rukh Khan?&quot;Me :- “Sit son, I have a story to tell you&quot;..

<b>This was undoubtedly the most painful scene of their untold story.</b> The way he wants to hold her tight, don&#39;t want to let her go but he&#39;s still letting her go because he doesn&#39;t seem to have many reasons to keep her by his side. The way Anjali knows how much she loves him, but he&#39;ll never see her with those love eyes like he sees Teena, the way he claimed he loved Teena when she was about to confess, and the way their friendship took a big turn and ended with just small words of how they&#39;ll miss each other, never knowing when they&#39;ll meet again, it&#39;s all hidden in their actions how much they care for each other.Yet Rahul doesn&#39;t love her. And she knows that. And she wants to forget him now. Of course, she never does that because it&#39;s hard to do that. Because he was her first love. Much much harder than anything ever. It&#39;s toxic and exhausting but its addicting at the same time. What makes this scene harder to watch is that they really didn&#39;t meet each other for at least half a decade because at that time, there really wasn&#39;t much ways of communication as there are now. Only a person&#39;s viable phone number  or a present address was all that a person could obtain in those days. So when Anjali said she was going, she really was going. Forever. Leaving him. That&#39;s what she decided. I still can&#39;t say whether I totally agree with how Rahul falls in love with her later, or how some people claim he&#39;s already in love with her. &#39;Cause Rahul was so carefree, careless, impulsive for the most of the guys of his age. So can&#39;t really say what changed for him. But the role of Anjali always pricks thorns at my heart, it&#39;s so real, so alive, raw and breathing (Kudos to Kajol Mam) that one can really relate easily to her on so many levels. To those who think that &quot;if you love a guy and he doesn&#39;t give you the same attention that you want from him so later when he comes to beg you to take him, you&#39;ll rather marry someone else&quot;First, it wasn&#39;t his fault that he didn&#39;t see you the way you saw him, at first, (believe me when I say I have a severely broken heart on this matter)but now that he sees you (never happened with me), atleast give him a chance. If you claimed you loved him, you should learn how to forgive too.I don&#39;t care how short, transient and baseless relationships are now at this age and era, but if yours is a true love, you shall never be able to forget him. Even if you move on from him, be with someone else, you&#39;ll still feel regret and sense of loss of your other half. It happens and it&#39;ll keep happening anyway. That&#39;s what true love revolves in your heart. <a href="">#kkhh</a>

I remember how much I cried as a kid for this movie, this brings back my childhood.
