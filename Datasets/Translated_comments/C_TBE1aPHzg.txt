And still got it wrong.. HAHA<a href="">

None of these people are Republicans, guaranteed.

what&#39;s the cat music at the end? I like it.

The original video is called &quot;Interior Semiotics

&quot;, this is a reupload version

Eh I couldn&#39;t cook anything but sandwiches and spaghetti till I was 20

I still couldn’t open meh spaghetti Os 😢😂

Idiots!!

Smells like 2010

Epic fail, yes America is doomed.

After 10,000 years of evolution the human race is FUCKED!

Better fan base than any democratic that ran in 2016 and so far for 2020!

<b>cries in bed</b>

This was painful

They are with her...

<a href="">

You get a Spaghetti O, You get a Spaghetti O,You get a Spaghetti O,..YOU ALL GET A SPAGHETTI O!!
Yo, how are you going to cut out the best part of this dumbass performance? Which part? The part when she rubs those black O’s on her body. Also the part when the camera pans across the invested and (somehow) impressed audience and you see a single female soul who is giving the camera a look that screams “wtf the actual fuck?”.

Next time get a pop-top can! I didn&#39;t watch the whole video because I have better things to do with 3 minutes and 23 seconds of my life. Like watching paint peel or grass grow. Lots more entertaining.

We are in trouble, these kids are going to be taking care of us..scary thought

?????

I bet if it was a can of soy it would be open in 0.01 seconds

Was secretly hoping the can would explode and blow them up... but in all seriousness Is this or is this not an autism awareness video?? ..

Somebody please tell me this is a joke

I am pretty annoyed by looping the cat piano song over and over

That cat is a superstar

Lambs to slaughter. If he did not want them sheared, why did he make them sheep?

I found my ex girlfriend

Omg My Generation has to depend on these people where f*<b>**</b>

So this is the next generation huh smh we are doomed ....

Semiotics... Dang people are morons, no wonder Trumptard won... It&#39;s not Art, it&#39;s Semiotics... Look it up... By the way there is no such word as gullible in the dictionary...

Can anyone tell me exactly where this was? Thank you

This isn&#39;t even the full video.....  =[

I could have open it faster with an old Swiss Army knife with much less struggle

Art? So, this was on purpose? I was latchkey. I&#39;ve been doing this since I was about 6. :/

Heave ho

So Ann frank and her Jews watching her open dinner 😂😂😂

Maybe it&#39;s best they do starve.

Useless people, they need to learn the old fashion way...they screwed if there&#39;s no power

Wait I bet everyone in that room knows how to hold a picket sign and yell things they don&#39;t know what they mean and I bet they all know how to get lit on some illegal substances js but hand them a everyday task and they can&#39;t do it 😂😂 I hate to be young these days I&#39;m surrounded by brainless cry babies 😂😩😭

I wish somebody had the balls to stand up and tell her this is bullshit and she has zero Talent

I heard this was edited (obviously) and in the original she fingers herself and pees in the can - which makes more sense, but I can’t find the original video. Does anyone know if there’s any truth to this? Judging by the reactions I would say it’s entirely likely.

wow...no safety glasseshow dangerous,and I felt that lid was going to cause some real damage.

What art school is this. Did she earned a B.F.A  haha

Wow!! My 8 year old daughter can use a can opener!!!

Holy cats man...smh

The fact it took damned near 3 minutes to open a can .....blows my mind. I would love to see these shit birds play with an MRE...or better yet....C rations with a John Wayne. ...high-quality entertainment right there.

This is just sad.

I dont wanna do art anymore

is this like some art project or something ?edit <a href="">2:55</a> YEEEUUUUPP i hope that place catchs fire

This is in many &#39;art&#39; spots/warehouses/houses in every major city. All art school kids find this as &#39;expression&#39; I hope this person opening the can is just exploiting how dumb these white millennial art students can fill a room and get applause for Campbell&#39;s and get inspiration for their thesis. *Seen this dumb shit in Philly. *Waste your (parent&#39;s)money going to UArts. *Go to the actual Art Museum that Rocky ran up the steps and enter the front of where actual art lives.

and they all got a trophy

Opening a can after getting your buzz on  and you and your friends think you&#39;re cool .

Open a can, get applause. Here&#39;s your participation trophy, a safety pin, crayons, play doh and a puppy. THIS IS PATHETIC!

Is this real? If so this is the most pathetic thing I have ever seen.

😂😂😂 OMG, someone should drop a grenade in that room and clean up the gene pool a littlebit...

What a bunch of tards.

Is this a bath salts addict support group?

and these idiots are watching from the side...
They are quite polite, giving her space, respect, etc, and definitely hoping she won&#39;t engage in an EPIC FAIL!

Awww isn&#39;t that Special, I mean her talent that is..... Just Special.

Can they tie their shoes? JEEEZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!

Use a pop top can :P

Really?! I can&#39;t even invite my friends to watch House MD..,

No... just no.

so apparently i do art when i try to make a snack while really drunk

that cat has more skill than you

and millennials want to go to war with republicans ....who have guns...............oh yeah.

. . . 😬 Wow. We are so screwed. They&#39;re going to be running the country some day. No doubt in my mind that room is one of those safe place things and I&#39;ll bet dollars to do-nuts every one of &#39;em voted for Obama twice. I&#39;d hate to see a try at using a P-38 military issued container opener. They&#39;d all starve to death. .

Millenials are so fuckin stupid.

WOW ! I wish I could achieve like that. . .

The entire room of people are thinking how stupid this is but are afraid to say anything. That&#39;s funny.

Uh Oh Hipster-o&#39;s!

are you serious with this shit

Dahhh Fuq?? Art??????? Get that birch some crayons!!

Check out the &quot;people&quot; watching. All social rejects and retards.

America is doomed...

you can do it!!!
And I suddenly realize why the Muslims want to cut our Fucking Heads off... Can&#39;t say I really blame them.....

Freshman Orientation

Leafy anyone ?

HISSSSSSS

Oh... What&#39;s the original title for this video? 

You have a spaghetti o&#39;s fettish?



You need to get your head checked out.

&gt;implying that&#39;s disgusting



nigga u gay
Wtf

Chilled chaos......

whats the vid?

xD

Actually, this is not a hipster thing, its more a combination of Valie Exports &#39;Genital Panic&#39; and Carolee Schneemans &#39;Internal Scroll,&quot; both are controversial performance pieces dating back decades before any of these people were even born. I was forced to watch films on both in an art theory class. Either way this is not particularly original, try explaining that one to the doctor when you get an infection eh? lol.

xD

Why didn&#39;t someone burn that building down? That many hipsters in one spot...who could pass that up..

@ancientpatrician WHY WHY WHY Did I NOT remember to never follow what someones says! This is tub girl,girls  cup all over again! only REALLY FUCKING STUPID!

First women expect us men to open their pickle jars, now their spaghetti hoops aswell... Ughhh

I am scared of stupidity...

@ancientpatrician whats so gross she opening a can?

This is what passes for fucking art these days?

@big2000dave Indeed. The edit is totally understandable. :D

@5seymour5 don&#39;t forget to put spaghetti o&#39;s on it before you do.

@ancientpatrician yes, the original is pretty tragic compared to this one.....lol

@trytolearn not any harsher than what really happened in the original vid......bllllaaaaahhhhhh!
