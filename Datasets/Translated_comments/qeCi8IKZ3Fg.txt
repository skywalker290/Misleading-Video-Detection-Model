Worst film of this planet

Spent a lot on star kids, set, clothes, jewellery. Consider to spend some on story line as well, then might cause less headache.

Happy birthday Madhuri Dixit Nene
Congratulations for 4 years of Kalank

Happy birthday Aditya Roy Kapoor

<a href="">1:55</a> Arijit Singh  goosebump 
Happy Birthday Madhuri Dixit
Congratulations for 3 years of Kalank

Agar ye trailer abhi launch hota toh pakka sadak 2 ka double record todhta Dislike me 

Ayushman khurana,Raj kumar Rao,Devendu sharma,others talented guy should get opportunity in Bollywood for Big budget,ignore Star kids, Otherwise Bollywood industry will be destroyed

Varia 

Someone just give Mr. Karan Kumar Johar a reality check,launch star kids I don&#39;t give a single fuck but make sure that you don&#39;t destroy the lives of upcoming self-made actors while you do it. Bollywood is a whole new world and you don&#39;t get to rule it ,you&#39;re just a fucked up gay producer who thinks he&#39;s the king

Best acting all  character master pice movie

Pls

Update full series

Good morning public all I need to watch this series

Thank youVery nice

Fan of Adito.

Amazing year

I see this film it&#39;s windfall i give him 10/10  but the end is not good

First of all.....Thanks for subtitless......

Hollywood could make realistic looking dinosaurs 26years ago but they could make a realistic looking bull in 2019 with 150 crore budget. ‍️ But the grandeur and opulent sets are breathtaking.

Best

Name ki Tara film b kalank he hai

Bakwas movie hai

Nice

I actually love this movie

Bekar film

Oo

Owsm 

People after watching trailer : epic awesome excited to see it People after watching movie : what a piece of shit was that Bollywood never gonna be good

It's a great film...but only 1+ M views...
Modi establisment is sponsoring to these kind of scripts, which degrade Muslims and ISLAMIC civilization, fact of the matter is HERA MANDIES was ESTABLISHED  by Ranjeet Singh who was a DAKKO of the Gujranwala, and SINING AND DANCING is HINDU CULTURE, In Islamic there is STONE TO DEATH PUNISHMENT   for  people who runs brothels or commit adultery , Muslims women are strongly order to cover themseleve from head to tow, like Hijab , there is no way  any Muslims can be allowed to drink wine or commit adultery under Islamic SHARIA LAW,  all these kind of Movies are propaganda of  Modi&#39;e establishment to degrade Muslims and Muslim Cultrue,

Finally the Rumors are true...This movie promotes Love jihaad...

trailer is beautiful superrrr️

totally the movie is of full of bull shit the only pillar on which its still standjng is arijit singh each nd every single moment he proved that without his contribution nd obviously shreya ghoshal&#39;s ghe film is rubbish( ek ka biwi bolta hai dustri aurat se shadi karo aur jo dusri biwi woh ek affair karta aur jiske sath wo affair karta hai uska maa ke sathe pehle wale ladke ka bap ka affair rehta aur woo lady purane pyaar ke liye conspiracy karta aur beh*nc*od ye dekh ke sala ladkiyaan roh rahin rahe...) * dont want anymore kalank on bollywood

Dharma productions should hire movie experts from Hollywood to make big movies.... this movie is shit basically

Bakwas tareen movie. Karan you are a flop director and a flop producer. Your dad was good and u will never take his place. You are just a wanna be English person.

It seems there is competition between Thugs of Hindostan and Kalank which one is worst film?AdityaCand KaranJ are definitely chaddibuddies.Sirs script script script please

Agar movie mai alia nahi hota to ajj cinema wale ko mardeta hats off too her performance movie ki story to

Adis Urdu ...
Controversial scenes in every movie, keep the chain alive...you live between security but I am a human being...painting a picture on Hindu-Muslim as if you are a friend, live till you die. Show me one and make a picture of a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy, that girl is married.... Why do you do this, everyone knows.... Those who feel scared, print your blank note... ...Thank you, you will improve Bollywood people...Tkt n lekar......Why are you doing this...Why are you doing this, making such a picture that you are united in Hindu-Muslim. .....Not a single thousand movies will be made but......Tolerance type of movies will not be made...No lesson will be taught............<a href=""># JAI SHRI RAM..... JAI HIND
And love u karna sir this my content number 7460947817 hellp me sir plz plz plz plz

Plz help me sir
Hi good work sir
Damn, this would be good with Shahrukh or Hrithik, the settings &amp; vibe is cool, but the actors are just below average.

Without Srk Karan johar nothing

it&#39;s copy or similar as movie laal pathaar (1972)
Just 1 million views, the film is still enjoying 
Very bhansaliesque

Alia aditya varun madhuri mam sanjay sir It was brilliant trailer best of luck for movie

Can&#39;t wait for dis!!

90% of the comments are about Aditya.. ..nailed it 

Adity roy waiting

I m waiting this movie for sanjy dutt...super hero in Bollywood

i saw Kunal khemoo&#39;s one scene but very intense and strong!! his name is not appeared anywhere...sheer unfair

Bc...love jihad dikha rhe h ye Bollywood wale
Aditya Roy Kapoor and kunal khemu to be the take aways!

<a href="">1:56</a>,the best scene

Where in India does this take place? Is aditya kapoor married to sonakshi in the movie and then takes a 2nd wife.

I have seen the full trailer and the movie will flop.
Varun shouldn&#39;t be in the movie.

Mind blowing Super hit

Last train scene amazing pore trailer me this scene heart touching 
Woww

There is no time, this is Kanjar Khana, Karan Johar is the generation of GAY.
<a href="">0:09</a> Alia looks so beautiful.

So the movie is basically aditya gets married second time to alia after sonakshi for some reason..and alia falls in love with varun..seems like they gave out the ending in this trailer where aditya is uniting varun and alia

Excellent all characters so fit in their so tough roles...Big movie...wonderful story of love and pain but lot of gain....Aliay, Madhurii G., Sonaskshi, Varun, and great Sanjay Dutt....super hero and heroines .

who else is only watching for aditya

sanjay baba 
Im ONLY watching it for the legendary, Queen, Madhuri.

Aditiya Roy Kapoor&#39;s acting skills are on another level. He&#39;s the best in the whole trailer 

Best scene from <a href="">1:50</a> - <a href="">2:00</a> ! The train scene, oh my goddd! Goosebumps everywhereee! Adityaaa  and arijt too! ️

Best scene from <a href="">1:50</a> - <a href="">2:00</a> ! The train scene, oh my goddd! Goosebumps everywhereee! Adityaaa  and arijt too! ️

<a href="">1:54</a>Thanks me later
Wow 

Ranbir se acha varun ki gf ban jati .. pagal...
Adi ka expression
<a href="">#shankymusic</a>

I still can&#39;t figure out what kind of movie is this?....A fiction film? drama or musical? looks dope tho....I will watch it anyway for Aditya 

Super rbbb
Varun Dhawan ... One of the most overrated actors in bollywood

Tajmahal Of Nepotism...

&quot;Naajaiz Muhabbat ka Anjaam aksar Tbahiii hota hai.Whole story stands on this dialogue.&quot;Phenomenal line

Last train scene heart touch 

Varun acting is same in every movie 

Another karan masterpiece after a very very long time

I think Sonakshi has some serious disease in this movie.. Maybe that&#39;s  why she wants to find someone for Aditiya,  before she dies..  In the train scene Aditiya,Varun and Alia is there but Sonakshi is not there.. So maybe she was already dead...

aditya roy kapoor is fabwhat a scene in end of trailer its amazing

<a href="">1:54</a> vfx fail
I m waiting this movie for sanjy dutt

<a href="">1:40</a> is that kriti sanon?

vry boring

<a href="">1:39</a> is she kriti sanon

Only for <a href="">#Varundvn</a> 

Karan the gay say kisi baghairti ki he umeed hy.

Biggest Disaster of 2019

alia tanted

Wow must be a clean hit of aditya thank god k koi achi film mili usay wrna to kafi badluck rhi uss k saath bollywood mn pechly Kuch arsy mn

Last part when I saw Aditya Roy Kapoor <b>boom</b> goosebumps ll watch for him

Aditya ,varun and alia

Dunia barbad h pyaar me bc  hattttt chutiyapa bc

Nice cinematography experience. But not a nice story i think :/

who else thinks deepika should be in this movie

Arijit and aditiya the epic combo. Dont forget &quot;kyun ke tum he ho&quot; was hit because of both.. 

The last part of the trailer is a rip off of DDLJ

Come-back of Aditya Roy Kapoor 
flop  Movie is out of touch.  The audience has changed.

Kamalka trailer hai
typical love triangle...in a different way though...hope it has a story...

These are flop movies, read this story and see, I think these movies will not be released even if they start, these movies will remain around 30cr.
The trailer is like.......
<a href="">

<a href="">1:56</a> is just love

Just a bogus story and bogus film

Why did I bawl??? Its gonna be a box office smash!!!!

Alia not only have beautiful looks but also showing acting skills after raazi.

Oh Kunal Khemu
Song is very well but i think this movie is flop

Alia , Vaurn nd adi bhaiii &amp; Madhuri mam. Just stele the show man. Awesome.trailer man ...  Surely gonna supershit. Nxt srk bhaiii nd kajol  mam. (V.D BHAIII &amp; ALIA MAM)

after watching it seems like Aliya is the centered character

yeh movie bakwas hai

Karan tried very hard to keep his favorite Varun in the main lead role. Even in the poster, he used him in the center. But Aaditya Roy Kapoor's amazing come back gave water. Because in the pure trailer, he is shown in the trailer and maybe it is his. Please log in again to see the repeat.

OMG that last scene was amazing nice thought...I just loved it.

Climax DDLJ ..?

OMG Aditya Roy kapoor left everyone behind by his expression 

Most of all comments are about ARK just love him 

Aditya Roy  Expression + arijit voice is love 
High budget Ae dil hai mushkil

Kalank trailer



Alia is looking angel 

This trailer... has cooked and drank.
Supper I want to see this movie fast waiting for it

What if you get bored in half the trailer and have to watch the entire film? This film is a super flop.
Varun +alia
A try hard

Wow awesome
Aditya Roy Kapur ️
Nyc

<a href="">1:54</a> For those who are here for VFX

Varia forever

this movie is gonna be
Wow 
Kunal khemu role is too different and better than in other movies..

Who&#39;s come to see the VFX error 

Wow amazing 

Wow

I sort of like the concept of the story of this movie.... But, I think the audience won&#39;t like it.... We are bored of love stories... My prediction is that this movie is going to be a flop

I had a tear in my eye...at the end...when he holds , and she wanna leave ..All I wanted was... Varun to catch her. Roop ki mohabbat   Mera haq h aur ye haq Mai le k rhuga. ..

osm trailer

Flop

Beautiful graphics

trailer looks very similar to upcoming Pakistani film The legend of maula jutt mahira khan fawad khan anyway this film looks very interesting and different story

I can’t handle this intense depth love story

Bund mrao fudideyo. Nikkami film

The last scene...

Love only sunju 
@<a href="">1:55</a> Alia&#39;s hand

This movie will be a megablockbuster

This movie is meant to show love jihad.
I think the four directors competes with S .Rajamòlli ..But brilliant work ,our support is  for such creation not for Race 3 ,and zero type movies .

Kalank nii ishq h kajal piya Nice trailer 
Boring movie

Omg amazing
Another Love jehadi propaganda film from the horribly mediocre  bollywood

Waiting to be released

Last train scene superb 
the story is quite good
What did you make of Devdas 2......hitttttt...hai
Last scene was too good

who is the biggest fan of  alia and varun jodi 

I loved how Aditya Roy Kapoor saved Alia from falling in the end clip

My question is if Aditya’s character loves Sonaski’s then why is he suddenly showing interest to Alia?

Super duper Flops sorry yaar flops sai bhee badthar

Flops

Soonaa ajyega theater main bakwas picture

Super duper biggest biggest biggest flops
Kalank is not ISHQ...!
Total chutiyapa

Bakwas

Oh bc wow

<a href="">1:50</a> ddlj again

Wow... Amazing ...the film will be awesome

So this movie is going to be love between Hindu and Muslim..i guess Partition scene in last.. Epic

Looks like fancy dress competition... I don&#39;t think Indians dressed like this in any era... Especially not in the pre independence era as shown here...  Looks like k3g

Confused

Please dubbed this movie in telugu

aditya is best

Is saaal ki sabsey behuda movie hogi which will earn crores. Likh k lelo bhehenchodo.

How many of u think this film will be a flop!!!!

arijit singh and aaditya are just amazing

brother what era is this from?
aditya fans because it's like karo 
Wow

Roop and Zafar! Stole my heart. There is no love in time.....
The stupidity in the train of DDLJ is back in Kalank 

Thank you for the subtitles! Looking forward to this move!!

All the best of KALANk .  Bollywood thumb up . Is saal ki sab se badi Hit hone wali hai Ye Film.  Kuch Naya sa hai.  Is film K waiting list me kon kon hai like karo

another extra marital research of Karan! are koi intense Kahani par kaam Kro yr... n stop copying bhnsali way of screenplay..

Who knows what is the story of kalank?

Who got the feel of padmavat?

Bekar ha

Last scene was epic man

Luv u aaditya 
Kya movie hogi i want watch this movie any how..superb trailor

Baba the great

best of luck Aliya diii

Madhuri and sanjay in a movie again
Often TBAI happens.
I&#39;m here for only Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sonakshi sinha!Varun Dhavan on the other hand might ruin this film! Directors should have casted an other actor 

Bokwas

Kalank nahi ishq hai kajal piya
Bakwas

A Threesome drama....

varun u beauty.
Boring !!!

Again creepy bollywood secular Hindu (woman) muslim (boy) love story?I don&#39;t understand why always muslim boy? Why not even cristian or sikh boy?The way bollywood promote islam, Never going to watch this

Only for ADITYAROYKAPOOR AND ARIJIT SINGH

Waiting full movie

Alia will reject Varun Dhawan in the end by rejecting his hand and going inside train to Aditya Roy Kapoor

Kya bakwasss chutiya movie hai bakwas tralier no sense

The ending thoughhh BESTT

You couldn&#39;t stop yourself from putting a DDLJ reference. Could you? Also why should every drama have an affair as a plot device. It&#39;s boring. We&#39;ve seen that a hundred times. Portraying Muslims as this womanizer/seducer in the name of LOVE is just boosting  islamophobia from Aditya&#39;s perspective and Hinduphobia from Alia&#39;s. It&#39;s not cool. Mah boy Varun has to face tough life because.... Reasons?  Same thing with Padmaavat. Remember that debacle? You can&#39;t make good stories and promote hatred? The trailer is trash...  Clearly. I wonder how the movie&#39;s gonna be.

it will be a history of Bollywood

During the Cheenal Partition, when you get off the train that was going to India, you will see Pakistani people... <a href="">#louvzuhad</a>
Movie superhit Jayegi Madhuri dixit Sonakshi sina Alia Bhatt
Gak sabar nonton film ini

So, if you being hindu ,love muslim by converting into islam , then it is called love! If  It&#39;s opposite, then it is haram!

Last moment in trailer and Arijit&#39;s voice ..... 
Worthless
Chutyapa
Aditya roy kapur is best

osm

Please dub in tamil also

I love adi bz of last scenes 
Varun Dhawan's overacting has spoiled the film
Superb...!!

Ready for another superhit of alia and varun 

Firse hindu Muslim love story wli bakchodiiThis shows Bollywood is shit

Varun 
The last scene just hits my heart!!MAGICAL!!!

Who is waiting for endgame after Kalank?

I think this will be the best Varun&#39;s movie I&#39;ve ever seen!!

&quot;Kabhi alvida na kehna&quot;Similar storyextra marital affairsWohi porani fazool story.Kuch to new dikhao BollywoodKaran johar rapit his old story again n againWriters ko pesy ziyada do 

Sonakshi u r really a queen... If agree then hit like...

Varun Dhawan is the new star of Bollywood acting tremendously
Who wants to see this Ghattiya movie? I don't want to watch this at all because I'm sure it's just a Hindu-Muslim thing, or it's not worth watching, or a stupid love story
All the people talking about Aditya but iam not because varun my favourite actor and varun very handsome nice and beautiful

Friend, please call Varun's acting too awesome.
Another love story on a bigger scale!

I am so excited the this movie. Aditya Roy kapoor is super talent. Love you all &lt;3&lt;3:-):-);-)

Pritam da ne phir churaya game of thrones ka music starting me 

The panty is full...
Blockbuster movies i Love Aaliya bhatt
Karan johar's film, train scene, arjith and shreya's voice, aliya and varun's diwangi, film hit to be heard 
bgm is copied from game of thrones.

Akshay kumar pani hunuparxa yo flim maYo flim flop hunxa
I&#39;m waiting for that movie <a href="">#varun</a>

spot kriti sanon

Biggest flop of the year,only good thing is  Aditya roy kapoor

Jai Shree RAM 
RAM RAM Sbko 
&quot;The end of true love often ends in disaster&quot; what a dialogue
Is that kriti at <a href="">1:40</a> or <a href="">1:41</a>?

Ye trial to poori story hi kr raha ha...kunal khemu and madhuri 
That train scene literary gave me goosebumps

Aditya&#39;s will steal the show

so a slut&#39;s decision ruins everyones life...where have i heard this before

E movie Pakka flop hogi.....
Wooow

<a href=""> if you’re a DJ snake fan, then do watch it.

I think Varun is Sanjay Dutt's innocent son Nd Aditya is Sanjay Dutt's real son Nd Madhuri love interest of Sanjay Dutt
everyone neglected Varun praising Aditya Roy Kapoor  he deserves it and  Arijit is  the reason of its hit

<a href="">1:33</a> kunal khemu? Why his name not mention in starcast!

I requested to Bollywood don&#39;t show Hindu Muslim marriage.. Nhi to kedarnath ka Jo haal huwaa whi hoga ye India hai Pakistan nhi

Did anyone get goosebumps in the end?

Whose kiss ending scene did you watch again and again??
Saala once again  Hindu Muslim marriage...
Just going mad to see it.....
The country is so big, its population is so big, its film industry is in the city, take it out or take it to other centuries, there is a story in it, I am tired of seeing the love triangle.
It should be directed by Sanjay Leela bhansali

Aditya superb
Aditya best
Aditya rocks
Love you Sonakshi. So beautiful 
Last scene 
bollywood mumbai or kuch log ki dasi bankar raha hai
What a movie

Infidelity - the fav. subject of Kjo now in a new (?) movie. hope this survive.

Alia bhatt&gt;     I love you 
Soils 
<a href="">1:40</a> I'm not sure what to do
Same old shit....

Another shit Karan Johar romdrama.

Flash ke background music chudane walo..janta kabhi maf ni krega!

Waiting for that day 17th april

Awesome trailer

In the full trailer I was like ummm
Bakwaas, watch this best south movie 
Jo jo manthe hain kalank hit hogi WO like karain
This Varun Dhawan is showing that he is a bastard &quot;How did you marry me?..&quot;
She could&#39;ve jumped off the train, it&#39;s moving so slowly.

bapre trailer ekdam khatarnak hy

We expected a <a href="">#VARIA</a> show but Adi roy kapur just stole the thunder !! Btw awesome BGM

And Again That Voice.. Love you arijit sir 
Students of the year 2 teaser upload Karo

yeh movie RSS vivad kerayga Varun ko Muslim dikhaya he Is Liyey...
Aditya
<a href="">1:39</a> I love this song
Last seen was killing

Wow Arijit Singh voice  movie is awesome 

I thought I heard this background music and score, I had 20% confidence in myself that the music is a copy of Games of Thrones and DC's Flash TV series. Then I searched who is the music director of this movie and found out that the music Director mr. It is Pritam, as soon as I saw it, I had 200% confidence in myself that it is definitely a copy.
The last scene

<a href=""> Watch this beautiful beautiful video

Flop movie.... don’t beat me please 

Kalank movie best dialogue Sanjay Dutt //Roop aur Dev ke shaadi se Dur Ho Safar Varna Anjaam Bura Hoga :: how did Sanjay Dutt's dialogue//.??????
I will watch this movie only for aditya roy ashiqui boy 

Love you Sanju baba very beautiful teacher kalank and you are very good acting Baba bollywood superstar Sanjay Dutt you are great Baba kalank teaser excellent

Masterpieces
Varun again win our hearts soo nice love you varun you are my favorite
Routine shit...

I must watch this movie

Dami.,.,Babbal.,.,.Aago
No one is here for veteran cast of this film. <a href="">#Sanju</a><a href="">#Madhuri</a>

I like alia but not in this movie.. she is not looking that gorgeous yet aditya looks amazed.. nice scene..

What is this story of India Pakistan Batwarey?? Burning the city and running away to Chad in Hindu log train
last scene is so much beautiful with the song ,  alia , aditya , varun nailed it ...waiting to see the movie , love from Sri lanka

Super flop movie, sounds like shit 
Aditya is the best part in trailer he looks so handsome dashing cutest royal...and his expression..mar hi daloge n what a acting...and his chemistry with  alia as well as sona....is best

<a href="">

The last scene stole my heart !

Why Bollywood never make movies with content.always the same old love stories...Totally disappointed 

Kunal khemu role...just wow..better than varun

Aditya&#39;s expression at the train scene is the best. You can see the love in his eyes.

Aditya look like royal prince how cute he is... love you so much adi...I am falling in love with you

Aditya&#39;s performance is too good.but adi ka koi to song hona na is movie me

Another one
i am very very excited

Dilogha Joredaar movie Rawan is the story of killing antha khatam karaneka kalank. After watching the movie you will know whose kalank it is and whose story it is.
hello!

Got goosebumps...cant wait <a href="">#kalank</a>
At <a href="">1:39</a> I think she was kriti

Reminds me of Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam

Omg varun u rock
Zafar and Roop!!!  Kalank Nahi.. Ishq Hai!!!!!!!!!!!  they fell in love and way their lives are. Its not wrong.  (its just the labels)Varun and Alia have so much chemistry. Cant wait to see them again on screen together

This movie is a kalank on bollywood ‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️‍️
<a href="">1:30</a> agar PUBG mobile India Mai ban Ho gayi na to.... 
Cello piece looks inspired from GOT

Movie super hit
Ark expression yr...isne to aasiqi ki yaad diladi

varun
Big flop coming soon!
Alia u r the best

How long will you keep looking at that old, worn out train scene?
So is Sonakshi Sinha pointless in the movie??”

alia and varun look amaaazing

Aditya Roy kapoor......Superb expression and background score of arijit

Hi- I dont mean to be a party pooper. But why have all recent films around the topic been solely around romance. The partition was an event that caused mass destruction and deaths. You do not see western cinema creating romance stories around the holocaust- and if they are, the movies are ignored. I would prefer, if for once, the partition can be seen from different perspective- i hope a new movie can be made that doesn&#39;t revolve around love. Otherwise I appreciate how beautiful this looks- taking nots from Sanjay Bhansali aren&#39;t we? :)

Who is waiting for the movie?
Bollywood new movies uploads why can't you upload all new movies please. Cheat IndiaJungleTotal dhamal hd meURIKedaranath Kashi search in Ganga KaalaAur bhi hai all uploads please brother
Flop movie.

This looks amazing! And I haven&#39;t said that about a Desi movie in YEARS!!!!!

Why Bollywood does movie more in green room??? . This movie is trash!!! Bajrow mastani was epic deepika and ranveer ️️️ this is piece of shit by Karan

I think that alia meets varun and sona meets adi, sona and adi are married but alia gets trapped into marrying adi, sona is also ready to divorce adi. Adi loves sona but bc he&#39;s angry at himself he distances himself from Sona, bc he wants her to be happy. Madhuri and Sanjay also had a tragic past in which they avoid each other now. Sona eventually dies then in the train alia unites with varun finally.

Dialouges could have been better yar...jinna intense music hai unna vazan hi nhi pad rha

Sounds like Game of thrones music in the beginning 

Kunal khemu 
Ark is giving same expression from last few years

<a href=""> Look what happened..Assistant director created a ruckus.
Why is this uploaded again?
So aditya is ajay devgund and varun is sallu

The actor who is living in the character -Aditya roy kapoor

At first I thought the ending of the trailer will be like the ending of DDLJ or Padmaavat.

The bastard who love jihad in the movie
aditiya sonakchi beautiful couple
i wish if the director was sanjay leela banshali of this movie!

Everyone noticed Aditya over varun, cause he&#39;s looking superb
Not so impressive trailer but it&#39;s a Karan johar movie with his favourite kids so definitely people will treat it like a Blockbuster and worth watching while the plot is looking very boring...!

Alrdy confused ‍️
Its so sad to see sonakshi seeing her own husband getting married to somone else why does he leave such a beautiful women.

Madhuriiii

Chemistry of Aliya and Varun 

Varun and Alia best couple in movies

One word: complicated! Let’s hope it lives up to the cast and hype...looking fwd to it. Aditya Roy is such an underrated actor.

I still remember the hype Created By the debut of Aditya Roy Kapoor in Ashiqui 2 .....Everybody Was Drooling over The Deadly Combination of Arjit&#39;s voice and Aditya&#39;s Expressions. Reiterating This Kalank is Already a Hit 

Now Please Don&#39;t fill this Comment section again with the name &#39;Arijit Singh&#39; 

Amazing
train scene was the ecstasy point...

Ek dam bakwaas movie hogi dekhne layak nahi ,biggest flop of the year, coz of floppest actor aditya and madhuri <b>RADDI</b> <b>BAKWAAS</b> <b>FLOP</b>

Aditya Roy Kapoor 
Aditya Roy kapoor my favourite actor. .I don&#39;t know y he has not done more films. .is movie me shradhha bhi honi chahiye thi. .beautiful pair. .Adishraddha. .my favourite

What is this boring, I don't understand it yet
ARK ️
VARUN DHAWAN Overacting ki Dukaan
that train scene at the end is just 

Bsdwalo bas teen char hero aur heroines ko leke threesome karo

no 1
Don&#39;t know why it gives me got vibe

The train scene was sooo epic, specially when Aditya saves Aliya

Looking at the Kalank trailer, it seems that it will be a blockbuster when it is released on 17th April. Dharma production hit like 
Aliaaaaa Looks kind of a royal n rajput type movie Seems to have Lot of suspense n twist  <a href="">#waiting</a>

Why it&#39;s always a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy  why not a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy

Aditya Roy Kapoor will steal the show..Take a bow aadi

The last scene gave me goose bumps

What a phenomenal trailer <a href="">#waiting</a> for KALANK...luv from Jammu

Superb Drama Superb Story Superb Action Superb Emotions   Five Star rating movie Trailer 
If you see me in Theatres for this, it&#39;s Aditya 

After many days, I got to watch such stories. Brother, the fun in watching films is not in anyone's mind.
Last ending is the best in this movie. I think everyone love this scene. Egarly wait for this movie.

nice

Kalank ke ab back to back part ayenge ,,,,all actors my faforit

Max payne

Varun Dhawan alia ek no...Blockbuster movie hogi10M like ️️️
The last scence man!

Awesome 

Proud of Aditya again.. 

Everyone is talking about Aditya , Varun , alia but let&#39;s not forget kunal khemu was looking dope and the intensity on that dialogue was awesome

Where is Salman Khan ! Oops it&#39;s not PRDP 2 ?!?

Oh mannn....this film is gonna awesome

Hit like for Aditya&#39;s lastscene 
Shawkat shows this for a movie
awesome

Eagerly waiting.. I hope it should be A Blockbuster 

Aditya Roy Kapoor will rock mark my words

Only aditya is worth watching.....  Baki sab bakwaas h.....

The entire trailer is tarnished. Nonsense.
What is the benefit of removing this thing from the channel?
Sanju welcome comback
Aditya + Arijit = Awesome 
who noticed Kriti Sanon&#39;s item at <a href="">1:40</a>?

After Aashique 2 he proves! 
Yaar I really liked the end scene, maybe it&#39;s going to be a love triangle

Aditya Roy Kapoor ️️️
Accha laga in the bracket hey sab kuch  .shaddi  ke baad extra marritial affair.hey asa log bolenge .per pyaar to hey . Jo sab rishte se uper hey.koye dharam pyaar ke aad nahi aur pyaar apne aap me ik dharam  hey.per iske matlab pyaar ke vaje se jo kuch hua  bura hua .vo hey kalank.sahi hey trailer movie dekhunga

I SO WISH it was Sonakshi in Aliya Bhatts role... Then all the scenes wud have made a much bigger impact... She is SO NOT WORTH all the blockbuster movies of dharma production... SO HAPPY TO SEE KUNAL KHEMU BACK... He deserves much more....

Did anyone noticed kunal khemmu?

At <a href="">1:33</a> Is there any Kunal Khemu also comment please 
Ddlj ka scene yaad aaya in last part with some twist 

This movie promotes Love Jihad..

Loved Aditya Roy Kapoor.. specifically The ending scene

I will go to Theater only to see the  aftermath of the last scene of the trailer .

Thank you for the English subtitles &lt;3 You made foreign fans of Indian movies really happy :) As a Polish girl I could only understand simple sentences such as &quot;I love my wife very much.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m married&quot; without subtitles. The trailer is really good. I can&#39;t wait to see this movie! The visuals are amazing! The last scene with a train reminded me of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. But I think here it won&#39;t end happily... Somehow I can feel the tragedy in the air... :(

only varun he is a batter than others

bakuwash trailer
Real feel noo language matter its trailer too tha full movie feel super trailer waiting for a movie it&#39;s tamilan

Arijit Singh + Aditya Roy Kapoor is a combo again . And at last the scene of train just awesome

Never say goodbye part2.
The new Kalyani jewellers ad looks amazing.

Great acting by aditya Roy kappor. What an acting sir. Hats off to you.

Typical Indian love story and movie ... ....ku6 to Naya dikhao
Aditya nailed his role !!! Was Bollywood sleeping all this time ?  He should get more opportunities.  Adi

I love varun and alia . I wish movie ke end me in dono ki jodi bne na ki aaditya and aaliya

Trying to copy Sanjay Leela Bhansali, thumbs down to karan johar!

Any malayalis???
There is no trace of time 
Aditya Roy Kapoor such an underrated actor

Luv u varun dhawan
Finally the wait is over...

I shouldn&#39;t have watched this trailer..it almost reveals the whole plot! ..Kya stupidity Hain!

Be a great movie

Love jihad
Dilwale dulhaniya le aayenge?
sanjay leela bhansali movie+karan johar movie=kalank..
Amazing trailer i love it.......bohat vadia bs film da wait aa

Is sona the first wife?

Last scene was much good when adhitya Roy protected her to fall from train and Aliya was trying to hold varun&#39;s hand with eagerly.

Wow,  all the best

Everyone talking about aditiya roy kapoor, this is insane, i mean his expression are awesome at the end ...

Flop u dog
Only fan of Varun dhawan...

Why they have uploaded again this trailer?

Last scene though.... Paisa wasool

Lgta h ab ke fir jalegii 

Varun
When this movie is releasing..??

Kya bakwas hai

Waiting for iiiit

Thooooo.... romba kanraaaviya irukku!!!!! 
In Bollywood if the character is muslim he should apply surma in his eyes or else he won&#39;t be identified.

KANK was much better... I mean Kabhi Alvida Na kehna!! I remember that time Nick name of that movie was KALANK and both movies are from Dharma productions!!

Hijra has brought another film which aims to disturb social harmony.
aditya!!! Joss acting!

Good to see the Indian culture reformed again in nowadays movies in terms of dressing and choreography! Hats off to the directors.

Invest your money in something better then making triangle love story type sh**s

Incredible alia
Aditya n Kunal khemu 
<b>ANOTHER BOARING LOVE JIHAD STORY</b>

Another flop on it&#39;s way 

Its going to be a Super hit blockbuster Film

aditya roy kapoor is gonna still the show.........

I don't have it, I don't have it..
boring trailer.....waste of time

Amazing!Last scene is fabulous with Arijit Singh&#39;s voice!

really nice one...eagerly waiting for the movie.

Last cien is super

Omg Aditya&#39;s expression and arjit&#39;s voice️️️it&#39;s such a delight.
love from egypt

The lageng of Maula jutt ki look a rahi ha

Bakwas hai

I think Another flop movie
Big time flop
Last part was mind blowing...

Roop and dev jodi is best . I hope at last there love story will complete.

Varun and Arijit fans like here....I expect atleast 100 likes

cutiya hindu Muslim issueMuslim as a hero , hindu as a villainghanta bollywood..

Every time the girl is Hindu and the boy is Muslim 
Only excited to see Aditya and Kunal in good roles after a long time.

Aditya overshadowed everyone
We should also try to make some films in such a way that there is no discrimination between anyone and can give a clean message to all the people!! Although such films are also made, there are more than them.
Dialogues are just fantastic , even many of us would be using also.

Have you made Bawaseer? Oh yes... Bakchodi also has bones.
<a href="">01:55</a> when aditya holds her hand when she was about to fall... Man that scene was kind of touching. And arijit&#39;s voice made it 10x more intenseWaiting for this movie️

Trailer was underwhelming. People are going on about that last scene between ARK and Alia..not goosebumps inducing at all for me. But overall I&#39;m more interested in seeing ARK + Sonakshi&#39;s pairing. They both seem solid here.

Aditya superb
Game of thrones music

<a href="">#Amazngggtrailer</a> <a href="">#the</a>_last_is_scene_is_just_phenomal
Sridavi were to be in this move. So sad

tried to copy bhansali theme..still love to bhansali sir..no nepotism

Kalank nehi ishq ki kajal piya..........This line on Aditya Roy Kapoor and Alia Bhatt just killing me...

Rahul Gandhi  The Next PM of India We Youths Are With You Rahul Sir CONGRESS PARTY ZINDABAD

Love the visually appealing aspect...

Congress Party Zindabad Rahul Gandhi Jindabad
Will be one of the best movies of 2019.

In Bollywood, films should not become a means of providing employment (like continuously giving work to new people), this will reduce the quality of films significantly.
Aditya roy kapoor is so amazing. He is natural actor.He deserves more good movies.

Aditya roy kapoor amazing! No words

Too excited to watch  ...who else like n show ur excitement... 

Aditya kapoor and sonakshi sinha looking awsome together... 

Was she kriti senon at <a href="">1:40</a> 

Gussay me liye gay ek fansla Is not a fansla it’s an over reaction which is what these characters are based on just like all of Bollywood. Who tf cares anymore

Pr team shitting like hell in comment section

Waiting to see Sunju baba in KGF chapter 2...KGF

Aditya Roy is looking different !
Very good alia keep it up

Damn that train part is lit

I got goosebumps!! The concept is unique.. I think I&#39;m gonna watch it nd love it 

Nice

Alia Bhatt is so beautiful. Although I can’t understand Hindi or English, it doesn’t stop me from loving Indian movies and Alia Bhatt at all, haha
Kunal khemu is also in the movie
aadi very good
Karan copying SLB, i can bet this movie cannot do more than 185cr. 

The graphics of the film are attracting people!! However, there is no difference in the <b>story</b>, like in the films of this era...
Damn... Can&#39;t wait for the movie like fr fr 

Ye to &quot;dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge&quot; ho gaya akheer mein 

devastation
I think it&#39;s like gadar movie

2 hours of depression

I feel that <b>Bollywood</b> films are losing their shine not only in <b>foreign countries</b> but in our own country!! Now these people neither have good names nor good stories!! Love-triangle is being served in most of the films, it seems that this is a planned phase...
I think big blockbuster movi hoga

1 number ki movie hone wali h boss
Arijit voice down everybody in this trailer

Aditya Roy Kapoor 
flop movie rahengi
They never learn.... Get inside the train through the nearest door

kis kis ko pasand aya

Alia 
Just missed Ranveer, Deepika and Sanjay Leela Bhansali

Outstanding trailer 
FLOP

Again d concept is on xtrA marital affairs...After marriage only dey fall in true love..

Once again! Varia is back , guys love you both and very much exited for &quot;Kalank&quot;

Did SLB posses Abhishek Verman?
Varun you best hero
last scence gave me gousbams

Varia
So nice i have nothing to say just woww

Awesome...wonderful..this type of movie should be made

Very pathetic 
This film should be make im direction of Sanjay Leela Bhansali

GOT ka background copy kiye hain

So many kalanks in one movie.

Super

<a href="">1:30</a> Varun looks like Shahrukh here
Dialogues delivery just like Sanjay Bhansali films very poetic and dramatic

Want actor and actress for my first utube video!! U will pe paid ... Reply me

Outstanding mind-blowing fantastic kuchh unique dekhene milegaa maza ayega I am full excited ess movie kee liye

nice movie

Expectations are high!

full emotion movie

Here's the focus on Varun and Alia, what else can you do to pass time in the movie?
Aditya roy Kapoor u beauty!! If u will work like this ,u will beat every if and buts of acting!! In such a small glimpse i am impressed by ur acting... Great work

Indian movie me hamesha same story hoti ha try something different like Pakistani films br br ik hi story bored now yar stop it
What is the trailer Osam?
I am so excited for this movie...

Aditya Shona
This film will be a blend of Hum dil de chuke sanam and Devdas.Larger than life sets, pretty faces, same old story with few twists here and there, dramatic dialogues, perfect costumes &amp; jewellery and goddamn music &amp; dance. that&#39;s it.. that&#39;s all it takes to make a blockbuster film and rob all the award shows.

Good nice
I was waiting for the title track from the beginning of the trailer .... And yeah it&#39;s there..... 

The main attraction of the trailer is the last partArijit Singh&#39;s voice and the chemistry between aditya and alia is just awesome 

Sajid nadiadwala shoeing love jihad and hindus clapping and whistling in cinema. I bet and u all knoe that if a muslim Girl was eith hindu l, a fatwa wud have been issued.

Such a waste of money done by dharma 

Ham dil de chuke sanam+padmavat+devdas+Bahubali= kalank..will definitely live upto its name.nothig new..doesnt look grand at all

Those Hindus are like this, they keep promoting stories of love jihad. First of all, if this Muslim girl is talked about then till now the fatwa issue will be raised about the neck of Johar.
One more film showing Hindu Muslim fight..... BTW all actors performance are best

Emotional attyachar.... Tharak se bharpur

Fav. Part kumal khemu... super hit loaded...
Chutiya Movie
I&#39;m very excited 4 this movie 

For aditya roy kapoor&#39;s character,n bigness look of movie 

Anyone noticed that after kedarnath, again a LOVE JIHAD story. Why can&#39;t the roles be reversed ever.

I think you guys forgot KRUNAL KHEMU people only talks only about aditya aliaa...But EAST OR WEST VARUN IS BEST... I WANT VARUN AND AJAY DEVGN TOGETHER IN MOVIES HOPE SOMEONE MAKE THAT HAPPEN

Another LOVE JIHAD story by shitty Bollywood.This time married woman with a zafar. Why i say why couldn&#39;t the roles be reversed ever?? Why this appeasement of minority is there?Does karan johar fear that muslims may fuck his life if boy was hindu and girl muslim because it is clearly stated in islam that a girl can&#39;t marru a KAAFIR.FUCK U BOLLYWOOD

Always Hindu girl and Muslim boy. Only after the film is released, here I am again. Shame Bollywood.
kunal khemu is way more better then leads <a href="">1:31</a>

Why did he marry her if he loves his wife?

Aditya and arijitPerfect together

Two Raj One Simran DDLJ return
Love jihad, watch it guys!
chutiya movie
Puri movie me starkids ko bhar hai
I&#39;m looking forward for kunal&#39;s part. He&#39;s such a good actor 

Rank in order after watching the trailer.1. Aditya (need no explanation why he is in top . he is rulling the comment section)2. Kunal (one of the best performance of villain n justifying with his role)3. Alia (her style her focus)4. Sonakshi (she is the sweetest character good work)5. Sanju (He is amazing)6. Varun (makers just add to put glamour hunky desi style , acting skills we already saw in Badlapur and October)7. Madhuri (just a big name old aged)

Dharma (Melodrama) Production 
Adi....Rockzz

Bollywood = <b>Randi rona</b>
Pakka 1 and Muslim boy and Hindu girl's love story
<a href="">1:54</a> ️️
Movie seems to be very nice and beautiful looking forward 

Sonakshi, aditya and madhuri stole the show for me !  this is called acting 

Karan johar ka movie always love mashed up hoga hai...haha
The entire movie is made on antihindutva and hinduphobia.
For the first  time i am shipping   ALIA AND ADITYA in a movie of which VARUN  is also a part of

Epic background music..Loved it..

Flop hone wali h movie....kyuki 6 stars ek saath h...isiliye movie ka budget high ho Gaya h..and  budget se jyada nhi Kama payegi ye movie...this will be the disastrous for sure... Pta nhi Karan johar ne Kya soch kr itne sare acctors liye h is movie Mai....

Arjit Singh voice attract
Shitty old school gisi piti love stories. Why bollywood&#39;s  every second film is on love story they should know that today&#39;s generation is bored of such things they need new concepts based films . I must salute to films like kesri , uri , the Tashkent files, padman , parmanu , badla and the same categories films which are better then this gisi pitti same kind and always boring hindi love stories .

Ab drama production ne shah rukh ko chor k varun ko pakr lia ha kb h releases
Where is sex scene

Picture hero heorine entry 30.00 minSongs 30.00minAfter tha story will run

Aditya Roy Kapoor 
1000 percent block buster hogee
Kis Kis ko lagta hai Kalank  super hit  hogi

I think they made things clearer in the trailer at a very large extent, when I saw the Train sequence, it seemed like it would be like DDLJ, but a sudden twist made all the difference, and increased the beauty of the scene. But still, the film should be way more than a love story. I like whole messed up relations in between the characters, I think that&#39;s the film about but it should be really surprising and extraoridinary to be called a Masterpiece, otherwise just simple bollywood love story type!

It sounds like the BGM of some other film...
Super hit

Varun&#39;s mind blowing performance .......

The last scene 

This going to be hit for century

Love it

Loved it yrrrr.... I don&#39;t know why I always get goosebumps when I listen this  music

Translation is here 
flim main 6 celebrity hai Lekin main  Arijit ka song pasand ker Raha hoon  ye  kalank hai...

I dont know why .. but Aditya seems excellent of all..wow

As always varun is going rock 
who started to saving money for  watch kalank

Background music is too much can&#39;t hear proper dialogs

Train scene is touching

The last scene was just phenomenal I can&#39;t wait to see this film..All the very best Team <a href="">#kalank</a> 

hit like for varun

Omg!! It&#39;s really going to be super hit movie of the year...Loved it !! What a fine and beautiful plot with amazing actors &amp; their emotions..

Okay. So here&#39;s a story of a happily married loved couple Sonakshi-Aditya but Sonakshi can&#39;t bear children so forces Aditya to marry Alia. Alia agrees but later realises it to be a mistake when she doesn&#39;t get the love of her husband. So she starts going out with Varun and they apparently have an extra marital affair. When Alia finally stops waiting for her husband and decide to elope with Varun, Aditya realises his feelings for her and stops her from going. Sanjay Dutt is probably playing the father of Aditya Roy Kapoor and Madhuri must have been his mistress/ girlfriend from his youth life. Here&#39;s story simplified. They basically gave everything away in the trailer. 

Wow Aditya Roy Kapur is gonna be awesome in this film. His expression was fabulous when he held Alia&#39;s hand at the train scene.

SOO EXCITED!!!! ADI AND ALIA TOGETHER️️
Wow trailerWaiting for the movie...Best wishes KALANK

Why do these Bollywood people show that the girl is always a Hindu and the lover is always a Muslim? This is why girls are becoming victims of Love Jihaad. May God protect Hindu girls. Jai Hind from this Jihadi atmosphere.
Arijit + aditya roy kapoor in 2014 =super duper hitNow again Arijit + aditya roy kapoor in 2019 = ?Vote for 2019 

This  film  is  totally  classy and  love  triangle  movie  hai  Shahid  let&#39;s  see  what happens  and  kash  iss  mein varun dhawan and alia  ki  love  story  dekhe  

Brother it was fun
Sanjay and madhuri ek sath

Wtf story is this? Some one please explain

Sir, no other movie can be made except this love story.

Superb trailer
That train scene at the end..Adi and Alia...I got goosebumps...

Very excited 

Great...it gonna be hitt

Last ending ADITYA CAUGHT  ALIA  WHAT e Epic
Full of asshole actors!!

Bakwas

<a href="">1:56</a> gave me goosebumps

Trailer is nice but me getting bored after watching this type of movie...

goosebumps &lt;3

Last session there was hope but it was wrong... If someone has taken the data of someone to wear it, then it will be on the train, then it will be possible for the mother to wear it...... or from Film 10 of the film. There is a copy.
Same bridge from saawariya 
Why would u distribute the trailor in two channels and the views also gets distributed ...fox star studio was enough for this

Anyone noticed all actors in this movie are Starkid..Nepotism on its height..Karan johar

Kalank

T series sucks
Nice trailer 
Wow such a beautiful movie I think this year also alia will only get the best actress award

Last seen was amazing.....

Aditya Alia 
Oh my God!!!! I can’t wait to watch it!!! Ahhh! So intense!!! <b>hyperventilating</b>

That moment when dady johar wants to promote his daughter and son but audience choose Adi s performance and Arijith s voice instead 

1 taraf Hollywood &quot;End Game&quot; bana rhi h, or ye sale &quot;kalank&quot;Avengers please thenos ki jagah inko nipta do

Who saw Kriti Sanon? :P
Aditya Roy Kapoor is the best in trailer
<a href="">1:55</a> aditya roy kapoor chaa gaya

Karan johar's film stupid film

Brilliant beautiful heart touching dream film.  LOVED IT.

Grand sets , costumes, dances, music,  copied bhansali style period film making.

Aditiya roy Kapoor on fire..aditiya roy Kapoor&#39;s giving his best performance in this movie.

Looking forward to watch it

what a scene of train wowwwwwwwww

Lovely

Another bollywood conspiracy to promote love jihad.We should avoid watching these kinda films.

<a href="">1:53</a> this scene was so mesmerising and arijits voice was magical enough to give goosebumps Kudos to all especially arijit 

Is this abut Hindu muslim love

Pc extra merit affaira we enna ne hi karna ne, naale fer ladiya we ehna ne hi karna ha
Aditya Roy Kapur
What is Sanjay Dutt's use in the movie?
Omg!!  Aditya so freakin handsome
Aditya nailed with his stunning acting

My word.. Arijit Singh rocks again. But Aditya Roy Kapoor stole the show here..

I don&#39;t like this trailer, too much drama.

A.T.B. hogi ye film
The last train scene was the highlight of the trailer. Not to forget  Aditya Roy Kapoor just nailed it.

flop jaaegii 
We took a xerox copy of the heart
varun has committed murder hahahaha
Why should Karan take his daughter and destroy the entire film?
Arijit 
Music like taken from GAME OF THRONES.

Sonakshi 
Why kunal&#39;s name is not mentioned ?????

Alia madhuri and varun  your performance is  always  fabulous i am biggest fan of you love you to much 

I think the story is in 1947

Best of luck kalank team

<a href="">#varia</a><a href="">#varun</a>_alia...love

THIS SHITTY INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE HYPOCRITES THEY TALK ABOUT EQUAL RIGHTS,INDIAN VALUES AND ALL THE CRAP AND STILL MAKE THIS KIND OF A MOVIE WHERE ONES WIFE HAVING AN AFFAIR WHAT EVER MIGHT BE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN THESE PEOPLE IMAGINE THIER PARENTS IN THESE KIND OF ROLES PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE AND MOVIES LIKE KABHI ALVIDA NA KEHNA CHEAP HYPOCRISY THEY ARE MESSING WITH YOUNG MINDS

Is this a love triangle movie?

No matter how many times the trailer is released, it will remain tatty. Icecream will not be made.
<a href="">1:55</a> Advanced version of ddlj

After watching that last scene, I feel that the movie is a super hit.
movie is purely based on luv jihad, hindu girl and muslim boy why cant they reverse

Aditya
Would it cross 1000crore box office collection

A trailer just 6 seconds longer than it&#39;s teaser. OK, great!

I am writing 17 April
Hum jante the ye sale bollywood wale Hindu ladki or Muslim ladki ka pyar dikhayenge . Fuck u bollywood salen madarchod..

Best run up 2019 working like this only Karan Johar

That train scene......adi killed it...

very grateful movie ..varun , Aliya aur adity ki acting ek dam no.1 h kalank ka trailer ek dam mast h ..

Did Anyone Else Felt That Background Music Is Similar To GOT? ️

Aditya Roy kapoor&#39;s expressions of emotions is on another level

I hope it wouldn&#39;t turn a movie with a superb trailer and a movie like crap

Anyone noticed kunal khemu?
&quot;Unjust love often ends in disaster&quot;Not a good rule to live by.
kriti @ <a href="">1:39</a>
oye its was Kriti Sanon  in <a href="">1:39</a>

Last seen in this video is tell all about .... Kalan nahi ishq hai kajal piya
Sala Kuch Samaj Me Nahi Aa Raha Mein Trailer
Smart move dharma productions

They doing early release bcs next week avengers end game is coming up no body gonna watch this for sure in front of tht

Who liked Aditya Roy Kapoor's last scene the most? Comment by liking.
Why same trailor again and again

Same old shit. Just have good vfx

Can clearly tell who&#39;s the nepotism products and who&#39;s the self made outsider from their acting

Triangular love story barun alia and siddarth between also Hindu and Muslim

just amazing..soulful voice arjit singh...luv from tamil nadu

I am here only for sona

Karan is trying to make Varun and Alia the next Shahrukh and Kajol but its never going to work

Omg Kriri Sanon is in the flim

But where is sanjay n madhuri&#39;s chemistry?

Avengers EndGame LikeKalank Movies Comment️️️️️️️️️
varun dies? 
Arijit 
Fans hit like Aditya roy kapoor 
Excited for this one

......And again a trash generated from dharma.

Last screen so good...
For how long has Bollywood been selling itself as a bitter or a Hindu girl's mother's sister, so that I can think, this is what should be followed.
aditya roy kapoor mind blowing

Why karan johar only works with particular fixed sets of actors like alia, varun, kunal roy kapoor etc etc. earlier it was sharukh. I have never seen him giving role to a rookie.

Arjit + Varun Arjit + Aditya One of the very rarest and deadliest combos...

<b>Finally there will be a content movie</b>

That shit bro , not hater just true review , first of all wrong character to play.

Alia's acting is amazing and because of Alia's talented face, this film will be a big blockbuster, please pray for me. Love you my sweetheart alooooo.
Aditya ... Perfect!!!!
This looks like a solid 6/10

I never expected Varun, alia and aditiya would be in a same movie and that too in this kind of movie I can&#39;t wait for KALANK I am so excited 

Ye to blockbuster movie h

attack on Indonesian cinemas
200 carore india me kr legi...Kon kon agree haine hit like

Why Alia Bhatt out of the million awesome actresses Bollywood has to offer! I was really looking forward to a good drama, and now she just killed my interest. So annoyed.

Love you Madhuri dixit
Alia bhat looking great 

Full classic film , yrr

is this Kriti Sanon @<a href="">1:39</a>  ?????

This soundtrack suits  so much more better than AR Rhamen&#39;s song for avengers infinity war. Who else agrees

Section 497 on Grand scale 

<a href="">1:50</a>-<a href="">1:59</a> Train and its scenario makes me believe that the story plot is based on partition time 1947 India&#39;s partition Because appearance of the train and clothing style says it all

Adi looks fabulous
<a href="">1:54</a> was the best part of the trailer.... Arjith Singh ♡

Superb movie

Wáïtiñg before thìß............

Till the climax of the movie the trailer told me what to watch now.
Ultimate CHUTIYAAP 
was anyone able to spot kriti sanon ?

Alia bhatt is the puppet of karan johar

Wow another story of a hindu married women alia bhatt and muslim boy Varun <a href="">dhawan.So</a> sexy.Hindu women muslim boy couple should be show in every movie.More and more films should be made on hindu girl muslim boy love story.Its so sexy to watch hindu women muslim boy love story.Its a kind of inner excitement cant tell.Hindu girl muslim boy always been a hot couple since 1000 yrs and its now common everywhere u can see hindu girl even married having affair eith muslim boy having sex marrying running wandering doing parties together

I don&#39;t know why I wanted Fawad Khan in place of Varun Dhawan in this movie?
