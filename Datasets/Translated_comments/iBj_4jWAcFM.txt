Watching this video on a Moto razr 2020 HAH . It&#39;s an amazing phone, very user friendly and i haven&#39;t faced any problems so far. So 10/10 

Incredible offers in the mobile equipment wholesale market- solely in GoCartopia.

I swear you sound so much like David cross

As an original user of the Razr motorola v3 this is the best video I have seen reviewing a phone ever, i laught, i got excited, I want to have it NOW (i Can&#39;t now) but I will someday :D thank you!

Commenting from RAZR 2019 

recently purchased this phone, and I love it!

Fast forward three years and here I am getting this as my first foray into foldables for a mere $200. It arrives tomorrow, so excited!

it doesn&#39;t seem like the specs are impressive

Phone is now $250 on ebay actually might be worth getting now.

That focking weeze was money 

I love that old-school skin that you can set its so dope.

I&#39;m glad I own one currently  it&#39;s a big differences and a new era than my previous flip phones .

The crease is noticeable.

The crease gets nasty

Oooh yeeeaahh. This razor is sharp

Two words, <b>sleek phone</b> @<a href="">9:34</a> ...
That’s as PC as it gets “ each individual hair is represented “… your face rug

MUSIC AT START ANYONE

What&#39;s the music in the background????? Anyone????

Selfies are way overrated. In 10 years I’ve done maybe 2 or 3. On for my passport photo and a couple of the pups.

Made in India lmao

I so want one!!

<a href="">1:09</a> <b>baby penguin noise</b>

Do not buy this phone as the screen peels off within 2 months of use, don’t waste your money, see the reviews as it is all over the internet about the screen issues, would suggest don’t buy as it completely crap. I have bought it and it has been replaced by Motorola twice but still the issues persist

I love it! I can&#39;t wait to get it! Love the fact I can put it in my pocket. I&#39;m a woman that HATE bags and purses. Fitting a phone so easily in my pockets will be a treat!

You got that cherry blossom phone? No? How bout the dragon?

ONLY GOOD LOOK8NG BUT NO GOOD BATTERY CAPACITY CAUSE ONLY 2800mah

I wouldnt even dare putting the phone in my pocket . Its so awesome though!!!

who&#39;s here contemplating whether they should buy one now that it&#39;s on deal for £400?

Just ordered mine today!! Excited!!

I just bought the new version of this phone. It fits in my watch pocket

Dont root for that phone. We all know its terrible .

I want the future in my pocket asap!!..&quot;its the way of the future, way of the future&quot;

Remember when then trend was to make smaller cellphone devices? And the bigger phones were called phablets? Isn’t it crazy how humans are? Never satisfied. Hinges were never a problem in the past, we had hinges before lol, instead they should be more concerned on how the folding screen should behave.

Good innovation foaldable moto fone but design is not good enough too old classic.

Neeh , not for me! Think of all the dust or sand that would go inside /around the hinges.

Hello moto
I wonder how changing the battery would be like.

When I see the design: “Hello Moto”When I see the price: “Bye Moto”

<a href="">1:10</a> <b>wheeze of death</b>

Po da komali
my excitment overs when I see its indian made. game over, no urge for this phone

It’s a nice phone, but it comes with a huge price tag. T Mobile sells it for $1,449.00 That a real insane price. I would rather pay that much for an iPhone 12  pro Max.

Seems like half of the price is due to the outrageous packaging.... It looks like a piece of shit.

Where do you get a protecting case for this?  Do they even have one for this model?

let me buy this off you

Tf was that laugh <a href="">1:07</a>

Yes it might be $1,400 but If you trade in the smart phone you already have it takes $500 off

I want this. I’m sick of Crapple

Razr 5G not yet for sale in Canada Contacted Motorola CA.

Question is there only 1 razr flip phone that is 5G or are the two razors 1 not 5G and 1 5GReason I&#39;m asking I went to my provider to purchase the Razr 5G but they told me the version they carry is not 5G Then I called provider main line and they told me that the razr they carry is 5G and that there is no razr flip phone that is not 5GHELP

Wow. Loved the Razor what feels like 20 years ago. This thing is epic.

That wheeze though...hahaha

This guy sucks

I&#39;ve had Motorola for years and this phone makes me want to stick w/ the brand! 

I showl ain&#39;t flipped in a while! 

Omg a razor i had the pink one  t mobile baby

Well yeah, that&#39;s what we expected

they wont sell any razors with this idiot video...nobody will pay for dark sarcasm

What I&#39;d do for that phone 

Bruh why they bringing back the early 2000s I thought we were all supposed to let those trends die the only modern trend it has is the price why tf would I spend 1000 on a flip phone when I could buy an iPhone

Does this razor phone do Bluetooth?

I’d like to get this for my grandma. Cause she’s old school with the flip phone. It’s time to bring her up to date..

So made in China to made in India. Call Motorola President Trump.... I’ll buy one when it’s made in America.

The wheeze was my favorite

It&#39;s to expensive

Been using a cheap $174 Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 since Jun 2018, still don&#39;t find a reason to shell out +$1k for a flip phone when all my basic needs are already met with bonuses.

The problem is there&#39;s no phone case available for that nice phone 

The nostalgia

This is why moto is my favorite phone brand

Too badass!!
Give me a shit recycled box and cut the price 60 bucks...is what im saying 

Chinese phone is good

I don&#39;t really like the chin part of the phone but I still want it

They should have spent on the phone to be developed rather than spending on box 8ts the worst phone ever built

It is a very nice phone, but the price is insane and unrealistic. In today&#39;s tech world, any phone is obsolete within a year...maybe a bit longer.

Im definitely getting on the upgrades of the razr 5 G

His name is Moji , get it right.

I concern about its poled screen，is it durable？

scp!!!!!!

Go VOTE for TRUMP

Thanks to 5CODEHACKER  on iG I successfully got my blue tick verification done 🇺🇸,  🇨🇦, 🇧🇷, 🇬🇧, 🇲🇽, 🇩🇪,   🇪🇸.
At the current price no, but I want flip phones to make a mainstream comeback sooooooooooooo bad. Sadly Motorola has been out of the flagship market so long that their software is way behind. Fingers crossed that they build themselves back into a powerhouse, I&#39;m loving what they&#39;re doing hardware wise these days!

My whatsapp number009203337803608

<a href="">1:08</a> that laugh Doe

Oh my god I really what this mobile . Gonna buy it soon 

Okay...that’s sexy 

Too proud n happy to see MADE IN INDIA 

What a joke

how do you turn off the feature so the external is always off unless I tap the screen? I don’t like it always on when I move the table or when I just carry it.

After saying this, I might need therapy. I so have a crush on this man. He is such a beautiful person. I love how you know your material and based on that, you can sell me anything 

All of these old model phones are coming back in style. I think I need to look for my Nokia from 2005 lol

This phone made me interested in phones again.

I fold my wallet when I heard the price

I want this 
I come back to this video just for wheezing Lew <a href="">1:08</a>

<a href="">1:09</a> when you accidentally sit on your dogs squeaky toy

Use a brush to clean your clothes... (and your phone case too).
Glad he went over all the features that he could use to advertise himself

That laugh
Excellent phone

omg please i need thisno shit i watched the trailer of that motorola and i got fricking goosebumps

May be in future it may become a standard model phone for all...

I expect more! The phone is 15 million dollars you trash!!

all jokes aside, this phone is really nice and i hope other phone companies dont steal this idea

Nays

The future is coming!... with insane prices slapped on them!!!

I want a pink one 
I&#39;ve seen a few boxes in my day 
If I would be a YouTube channel that test whether or not you should get a phone, one of the test would be taking out your frustrations out on the phone being shown. I mean smashing the damn things on my head to see how durable it is, never mind smashing them on the edge of a desk or corner. I&#39;m pretty sure this wouldn&#39;t last with one headbutt. Lol

<b><a href="">9:34</a></b><b> MADE IN INDIA</b>

Motorola has always been my favorite phone.Pity South Africa is not supporting this brand .

Folding tablet

I feel like this was a big downgrade from my Samsung Galaxy s9+.

Oh my god, I want this!!!

can we play pubg???

Was the smartphone made of flip phone, or was it a flip phone made of  smartphone? <b>They scream, for they  do not know.</b>

When will the motorola z5 come out in 2020

Oh yea I&#39;m buying

iPhone need to release a slide up phone with keyboard like the old SideKick. That would be a dope ass phone  plus it would be so nostalgic asf ☻︎

God that an expensive one doe reeeeeeee

This guy looks like a budget david fincher

This phone feels outdated already

Hi Motorola.. My name erywans and I am deaf hearing... I like the phone Motorola... I am from Malaysia kuala lumpur... HELP YOU... I want to buy Motorola and long time see MOTOROLA

<a href="">1:09</a> by the way

Waiting for the price to drop to buy this.

When your parents say your first phone is going to be a flip phone

<a href="">1:09</a>

I still dont understand why the flipping action is necessary

Here is a good question, can it be used without having to have head phones on. It seems like companies just worry about making it a TV then actually fixing the one problem and it&#39;s when the caller on the other line says they can&#39;t hear u clearly and u have to put ur headphones on to use its mic.

This phone might be the only reason ill go to team android

<a href="">1:09</a>

Pay over a 1k for a phone and no cases exist.. just like the old razor, dropped once and it’s DONE

<a href="">1:10</a>Don&#39;t make it a song!!

<a href="">1:09</a> his laugh was just the best thing I heard all day

the flip phones are coming back, now its no longer a roast to tell someone that they have a flip phone

What this phone needs.... Is a gimmick!

My parents you can pick out a flip phone me:

Oh snap! The leather cases are coming back.

The U.S. ban really stifled this phone. I would of been all over that if it had Google services.

Finally a phone made for the tiny pockets of women’s pants

Z flip is better

<a href="">9:35</a> made in india Haters gonna hate this

E ink still not available
I have

<a href="">3:37</a> he can tie his shoes Standing up 

Yesss back when phones had me on my toes, now do over the atrix, droid and razr hd, time for blackerry, htc and nokia to bring something unique that people love about there phoes and build on it

can&#39;t believe this video was made before the world got lit on fire

<a href="">1:08</a> WTF WAS THAT LAUGH

He said &quot;it&#39;s to your right&quot; very annoyed and confused 

<a href="">1:10</a> Click repeatedly. Have fun. Baby chimp calling his mama. 

If I was to have a smart flip phone I think I would definitely go for this one here

For 1500 this mfka better came in a space ship‍️
It&#39;s  made in India

At <a href="">1:07</a> is that a baby dolphin

no thanks its to over priced&amp; it seems like it brake easily

How much does constantly bending the LCD smart screen damage it?Doesn&#39;t snapping it closed risk cracking the screen?

when she tells you to go deeper <a href="">1:09</a>

Not a good idea for a flip phone. Wear and tear is much on screen.

Why is this barely recommended now ‍️ 2020 this is bad

I DONT LIKE IT

Motorola for businessIphone for my privacyAsus rog phone for gaming
Finding it in it’s small form when u lose it n dead

I think as technology gets better this idea will too. But for now even the s9 is better

This guy isnt really having fun.

They may have some sweet packaging but that&#39;s not going to enhance the performance. S9 is better even. But for a fun looking phone it&#39;s right below the s9. I love my s9.

God this guy is annoying af Look that asian dude is like holy shit when will this be over.

Tbh.......that shit look stupid as hell

It costs $1600... the most I would pay is $400

<a href="">1:09</a> He sounded like one of those toys you squeeze and make a noise 

Anyone else try search razor x?

<a href="">9:33</a> oh my god what did I just see. Made in India.

Moto focused more on packing rather than on phone itself

Flipping a phone was an inconvenience to begin with. This phone will not sell alot

I miss the man stfu flip

Tbh i wanted this but its 1500 imma just stay with my iphone 11 pro

nice try moto but i&#39;ll pass, at 1499 this stinks of failure, i&#39;ll keep my rock solid 11 pro max for another year

Nobody:seagulls: <a href="">1:10</a>

The most futuristic phone ever..this what we need in the future..this what smart phone should’ve be...this is 2025 smartphones..

What about games

<a href="">1:09</a> yes

<a href="">1:09</a> nobody gonna talk about the noise he made 

if only iphone put this much work in their phones

Nobody wants this shit I’d play with it on display but I’ll never want to actually own one

<a href="">01:09</a>- seagulls at the beach.

No one wants Verizon&#39;s service ..deal breaker

<a href="">1:09</a>

I’ll sum it all up for you: <a href="">1:09</a>

<a href="">1:09</a>That sounded like a door creaking

It&#39;s a good phone, I&#39;m satisfied

Proud! This thing is made in india!

This definitely brings back 2007-2008 memories for me, when I was still in grade school!

I&#39;m 16 and I like Flip Phones......Is that weird?! lol

this is the only phone that excites me for long time ..I will buy it first day it arrives !

That wheeze at <a href="">1:08</a> caught me so off guard. I had to go back cause I was like tf???

I like it a lot but damn. . . . .that price though. If I could get it for 11k or 12k, it would be acceptable but I&#39;m fully aware that this is the first generation of new Smart Flip Phones so I think I&#39;m going to wait the the second Gen Moto razr to come out 1-3 years from now with presumable better battery life and an audio jack and slightly better price tag. But I am so glad people still like retro tech and are improving and modernizing such concepts. Can&#39;t wait for what the future holds.️

Damn Motorola never giving up the flip phone phase 

<a href="">1:09</a> sounds like a dolphin lol

China mobile
In recent kdramas they are using this phone in their shows and I was intrigued

Anybody know the make of sweatpants he&#39;s wearing? I dig &#39;em

i love that &quot;Whoa.&quot; in the title

At <a href="">9:36</a> you see RAZR , Designed by Motorola, Made in India  🇮🇳

<a href="">9:02</a> finaly someone who cares about that, and motorola there to solve the problem.

This smartphone is the future. Ones more everyone want to have this phone like in 2006.

<a href="">1:09</a> screech of joy

Very expensive I can only watch this expensiness only

Sir you are awesome but the only thing I wanna know how much do you earn can you share it just a Rqst.

that intro is sick haha &lt;3 that should be an official intro of your channel

Did anybody noticed &quot;made in india&quot; mark.

This phone is such a game changer! I remember when we had so many options for phones, and now they’re all the same... honestly this is definitely the future!!!

This could be my next phone

The guy more handsome then this phone.

As cool of a concept as this may be, you are paying only for the foldable screen. Everything else about the phone is dated but the price of the phone is 2020 flagship

The best part-- <a href="">9:35</a> Made in India!

Love it. Too bad I’m too deep in apple.
I would switch to this from iPhone for the flipping alone.

Guy like you.. 

if it was a bit bulkier and super tough it would be my dream phone

i love how everyone is like motorola is dead but actually it&#39;s not like the moto g series is really great i own a motorola moto g6 and it is really a great phone

Made in India? Not China? I want one.

“Oooh that’s fun, that’s fun, I’m having fun, isn’t that fun.”I’m sold

I was a huge fan of the original razr.  Had the razr v3i that I thought was so advanced back in the day lol.  I was so excited to see a new one coming out because I miss smaller phones.  Then when I saw the price I almost threw up.

<a href="">1:09</a> Looks and sounds like Zach Galifianakis

Watch me dance with my juke..

62.99 a month. I guess they figured every person who lived in 2004 would be going crazy and flocking yo the stores to buy this phone. What an absolute rip off. Awesome phone but 63 bucks a month aha 

Motorola woke up with a great wonder
Bro, i love motorolas, i have a Moto E5, love em a lotEdit: also, i think all of the Motorola&#39;s phones are made by ofc, Motorola, but the software are made by Lenovo, basically, 2 companies make phonesI&#39;ve had a Lenovo too, it was kinda fucked up because it was already used, but it&#39;s really good tbh

I just flipped my wallet back in.

For your information nowadays :Motorola is under Lenovo companyBtw support my channel

How&#39;s the durability of the screen? Has it worn down much?

Watching this on my motorola razor 2019 feels so satisfying

That’s an ugly A$$ phone.. why am I even watching this?

<a href="">1:10</a> when e tell a joke to that annoying friend

Motorolla they only sell the motorolla sleeve case in US only but they sell the phones to other countries and not allowed to distribute any accessory outside :( any suggestions to get a case to protect this investment ....

&quot;Made In INDIA&quot; 

Capitalism b.s at its best.

Beauty! unfortunately it probably runs on Android.

Impressed by this phone. Looking forward to the moto razr 2 tho.

8 months and its still not here.

Made in India,Proud Indian

What do you call the smart screen on the front when it’s folded? Used to have an old phone back in 2012 or so that had the same screen and trying to find it

Made in India 
I’m usually an iOS guy, but this is pretty good

It will feel great to slam the phone shut to end a call so the other person knows you&#39;re pissed again.

I am big fan of old Razr but I just dont like that camera in front it just looks so ugly:(

When the tea is ready: <a href="">1:09</a>

I used to be a big Motorola guy back in the day.  Now, I stay true to my iPhone.  I wish Motorola luck.

Far better then Appel

$1500 though?

My dog actually managed to crack the sapphire display on my $400 Duraforce Pro 2. Took it as an opportunity to order this phone. With Verizon having sales with covid-19 going on, I had to.

Finally something that can actually fit in girls pockets

Only if it was samsung it would be better.

i one one

The real question is which phone odes he actually use?

The best part of this review comes at  <a href="">9:36</a> 

I hope they design second iteration of this phone once they work out all the bugs that the first gen will find

The fact that it folds up also save the main screen from getting scratched up in your pocket if you ask me to put like keys in your pocket with your phone which I&#39;ve done

SAMSUNG. Hey I foldMOTOROLA. Hey I flip APPLE. Hey I do fuck all
It&#39;s Manufactured in India

The price tag is way more expansive than I expected, I will definitely not pay more than 500 dollers for this.

1946 british pounds here in the UK right now with EE and the shittiest plan ever of 4gb

<a href="">1:09</a> he sounds like a kid about to scream for something

I wish my IPhone XR had this type of box in it but Apple Also I do want this phone for whatever reason

Motorola&#39;s still around? Damn.
Sexxxxxxxxy phone...a must have.

Anyone know if this is available in the US? Every time I google search this phone it pulls up a phone from Motorola called the Razer 2 that is definitely NOT a flip phone!

that guy looks like he dont wanna be there lol

Where is Motorola made?? Looking to buy the moto one vision.

APPLE=EA RAZR =2K GAMES

2019: &quot;Man, 2020&#39;s gonna be a great year!&quot;2020: <b>laughs silently in the corner</b> &quot;Yeah&quot;

No one will buy this shit

<a href="">1:09</a>

sorry this is it !:09

That laugh though <a href="">1:19</a>

You just made me wanna buy this even more. I’m changing in my iPhone X and possibly leasing this till I buy it. I’m of age when this phone makes perfect sense to me. I need this now.

20 year olds are like what the fuck is a razr

Is this phone compatible with the Snapchat app?

Funny thing is in 10 years this thing will be obsolete just like nokia flip phones 

pls... ask moto to emerge

Motorola went all jon snow on us...

TOTALLRipp off in uk Will cost you £3k £100 quid for a month contract

Had Motorola for last 5 years.. not even interested in the competition.. fantastic products

Can I talk with it while it&#39;s folded and make phone calls and do vedio while it&#39;s folded,if it does I&#39;ll give it a try.

<a href="">1:10</a> wtf was that laugh bro 

I Had one at one point! But Motorola still makes great phone just not flash back one’s.

I make minimum wage...should I get this phone?

I love it I want one but I remember the original one I had one and the hinges were not good

Scared that it&#39;ll just break when you open it really hard

I would like one
I want one

<a href="">0:27</a> Ahhh, sudden mannequin
Better than a Samsung Z flip

You sir are the reason why soon I&#39;ll be on the way to get me a Razr phone. Did not hear any complaints, just excitment.

He sold me on the Box though

Hey, this expensive phone.... What kind of life does one have to use on such a phone?
Oh yeah check out that pose looking like yeahhh my mom just got me this Motorola

Can you please review any games

&#39;Unboxing experience&#39;Fuck sake how is unboxing an experience!?The world has gone fucking mad.

Ok but what about the specs and the battery life i&#39;m pretty sure you wont be able to game on this phone and what about the video quality of the smartphone i&#39;m sure it&#39;s not 4k useless device cool hardware but that&#39;s about  it.

This phone companies releasing all this FLIP design again, should consider using separate screen or 2 screen display as 1, and not a single foldable screen its not as promising

<b>ah... What a nice phone...</b><b>Wait... I need a case and screen protector.</b>

I want this brand in my country...

All mobile phones are same after 1yr of uses...fcuk

Moto is the future of mobile phone

<a href="">9:37</a> Its made in India. That i didn&#39;t know

Woow that is amazing :D

This will hit the market, welcome back razr

Can&#39;t believe I actually paid $1571.24 for a damn phone, and $100 for a freakin case. never ever even paid that much for a pc/laptop...trust and believe I didn&#39;t do it for specs. The old Razr had a special place in my heart. and The new Razr put a hole in my wallet 

Looking Great. Excellent.
This is what a folding touchscreen should be

You talk too much mate

Supports 5g?

Rahne dijiye hm nhi lenge dal lijiye
The first smartphone that fits in a girls pocket

I had moto

Bb luv loop . Mtv

WTF ....$3K...I gotta sell one of my nuts for that .....

I was a Verizon store the other day and they had this phone.  I asked the sales rep how many they have sold...zero.  no one wants this phone.  Especially at its price point.

is it a mono or a stereo speaker?

1500 for a phone with inferior ram and outdated snapdragon

Me: Mom, I want a better phoneMy mom: Fine, but I don’t have any money so I can give you a flip phoneMe:I want an iPhone!My mom: Just wait for itThe next dayMe:AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!My mom: told you it was a flip phone, a 1,500 dollar flip phone

brand dsn need advrtismnt

Did you see that made in india. Yeah 

Dramatic phone calls, here I come!...I, uh, think I&#39;ll just get a Nokia instead.

lol, not the kind of phone you wanna give a child to play with, i see them breaking it into two lol

When I can’t buy this ?

I&#39;d be scared shitless about dropping that thing while it&#39;s open. I&#39;ve gotten away with dozens of drops of my OnePlus 5, that&#39;s probably why I&#39;ve had it since September 2017.

HELLO.. MOTO..

I had the type C to 3.5mm jack cable with my Moto Z and lost it immediately :)

Now my wallet feels flexible too ...

1500 bucks wtf no lol. Not worth that.

<a href="">9:33</a> Made in india 🇮🇳
This kind was my first phone lol

That&#39;s made in India

<a href="">01:09</a> The best Baby Laugh ever kkkkk

<a href="">1:09</a> What a fuck ?Stop smoking kkkkk

I am gonna get the next improved version of this, kinda sick of iPhones

I want this phone so bad

The Winking face just sold me on it @)

Z flip is better

Jack needs a cup of personality

<a href="">0:27</a> - that guy face xd &quot;uhm&quot;

Yesssss

Can&#39;t wait for eSIM to be supported in my country

Wow, amazing creativity
<a href="">1:09</a> it sounds like a screem

it&#39;s clearly, CLEARLY,  the future of smarTphones. Or at least it should be. this is great. GREAT.

Why no gaming review

That wheeze at <a href="">1:09</a> had me rollin

Phone case companys:<b>CONFUSED SCREAMING</b>

Can we get a more upgraded version just like with the regular razr .... Like the v3/v9 ect

Its a pretty nice device... but the price its to high, i mean the characteristic are   from a medium device and the price its for a premium one

Its ok for the simple folks that want a simple but fancy phone. Ill stick with my note 10 plus superior just about everything.  But come out with a foldable note and im sold.

We can see now the mama Cheetah calling out for its cubs that are hiding from predators. Instead of roaring the mama Cheetah gives off a chirp and a laughter mix. <a href="">1:10</a>

Dude never seen unboxing like ever .Full of Joy.

Finally a smartphone that fits in a women&#39;s pocket

I want this phone so I can flex on everybody

Seeing z flip this looks very very bad

The Name Says it all guys, cutting Edge

MOTOROLA IS BACK!

When u want to buy the phone, because of the box...

Made in India !  Like the apple

It&#39;s .... Good looking ???

classic razoris  got great design. even compared to new razr. i love the metallic  keypad . this rzr amazing too, but still the classic is the best model

Stop beating your flip phone.

Bro.... I want one so bad ahhhhahaha lowkey want it in pink like all the 2000s mean girls had in movies 

I&#39;ve still got my original Motorola Razr. I wonder what they are worth?

I would get this in stead of the z.

<a href="">1:09</a> good material for meme

Made in India 🇮🇳
Nowadays we are getting very expensive futures.

Watching this video because Samsung just released the Galaxy Z Flip

Made in India luv that

<a href="">8:31</a>  Y U Disrespec my home?!?! xD
It is just 2012 phone folded

I want it but also don’t want to get rid of my iPhone

Not the same without the sharp glowing physical keyboard.

You know. The reason why this phone is cool it&#39;s because it was released by Motorola. Samsung copying this is just ridiculously awkward for Samsung smartphone fans.

Best android phone ever..

He can&#39;t even afford youtube premium
hey dude i have found someone here in Albania it is like your twin i swear it is you sozi  it has almos the same voice he sell t-shirt when i saw him i said with myself how is that possible oh god im shocked really

this phone just good on businesses and reading new . just for regular used .

Thx but no thx

does anybody know the name of the first song? starts at like <a href="">0:07</a>

All idiots out there: &quot;Iphone (best software optimization and performance strongest SoC out there) is just overprized shit.&quot;Also all idiots out there: &quot;Wow Motorola brings out a Smartphoe which is more expensive than every Iphone out there with just a shitty Midrange SoC. I must have it!&quot;All people with more than just three brain cells: Facepalm

two years ago  I got tired of always dead iPhone battery and skyrocketing price. I switched to Motorola 6 only for $200. It has bad camera but all other things ok, it really reliable phone. Now looking for my next Motorola.

How does this phone feel now that the Samsung Flip is out...

Rip headphone jack. We will miss you so much..

I wonder if there will ever a sidekick phone smartphone hybrid would love to flip a side kick open again 

Lou so faithful the to pixel. I salute you for that.

Omg at last a phone that fits in the pocket. Thought my iphone5 would never last the waiting time. I used to buy the latest iphone on release but stopped after the door in pocket insanity started with smartphones going giant. Finally we can get back to reasonable pocket size. Yes yes yes.

Made in India

I’ll be switching back to the razr for sure. So sick of the large plus or xl mobile phone sizes. I just want something comfortable to carry in my pocket. Thanks Motorola!

Awesome I loved that phone and I super love this one!, even when I’m an Apple user 100%, this just brings back cool memories when phones were part of your personality. I WANT IT!!!

<a href="">1:09</a> when she keeps suckin after the nut..

Did someone noticed “made in India” wtf

Made in india...shieeeet

its a gimmick and i know it but i want it so bad

iPhone 4 was the last time I got so excited about a phone. I. Want. This.

<a href="">1:05</a> how the he’ll did he make that noise

I like the design, but I don&#39;t like the price, and I also don&#39;t like the verizon exclusive.

z flip is better

I need that phone

This phone already looks outdated compared to the galaxy z fold

Wait isnt this phone shit? Like really really bad?

Who come here after samsung z flip ?

Sick video as usual !! 🇨🇦🇨🇦
Made In India is Satisfying to see than a Made In China

<a href="">1:08</a>

Motorola: hello motto Samsung: sorry it died, sorry for your loss

<a href="">9:19</a> “ Made In India “

Ok waiting for iPhone flip Fones now..lol iPhone user here..

This one is way better than Samsung or iphone

Feel like Samsungs gunna steal the show with this one

Motorola: 2009........ wait for it.......... wait for it.......waiiiit for iiiiiit......2020..NOW! ladies and gents Alien Technology.

For that amount of money it should come with so extras.

Now if they could bring back the sidekick 

I like Motorola phones but is the face glass or plastic?

Bit bias
Video over, I&#39;m satisfied. <b>W H E E Z E</b>

Top Statement:Bottom Statement:

I hate flip phones no matter how nice they are, it can be a 12.3 inch display with a 700 MP camera and even a 20 TB internal storage (actually I don&#39;t think they have phones this big, not yet anyway) I still hate flips.

What a beauty! Samsung is in flight (which is strange, because Sams made amazing clamshells and sliders). But, very expensive and very flimsy.
Most innovative phone of the year period.  A great idea updated.  I loved my original RAZR, loved hanging up with a flip, will love doing it again.  Well done Moto!

Samsung is savage lol. They literally just ended Motorola&#39;s short life span at a come back.

Samsung Galaxy-z flip would destroy this phone.

this guy is too dumb to know like most of his subscribers that MOTOROLA invented the cell phone in 1984.  Look it up on Google.  He have car radios because of Motorola.  Not that a bunch of millennial douche bags care but they invented the space radio&#39;s for the astronauts and 85 percent of all technology we have today concerning communications.  Police and all military and coast guard radios are theirs.  This gray haired fool doesn&#39;t know dick except for the ones he sucks.

Leu, please change the aspect ratio

I had rumor by LG I wanted a razor back in the days I couldn&#39;t afford it 

I don’t care about St Louis!
So now does anyone think this still looks better than the Galaxy ZFlip?

Jajajajjaaj pice of scrap

I&#39;m just waiting for next gen pagers to come out

Very ,Happy come back. Also so proud to see Made in india on the phone.

I&#39;m dissapointed that he didn&#39;t knock the knockable things on this phone like the picture quality, speakers system, and the fact it&#39;s not a premium device seller for a premium price

Samsung:Z FilpMotorola: <b>dead</b>
Jerry Rig broke this phone....time for you to break it too

Who is here after the trailer of Samsung flip z and dead of motorola razr???

I loved  my old razr and had the Razr V3 i would use now if the battery charged, as it had 3g i think from memory

This phone is gonna fit really easily in my pocket now that there&#39;s no money in it 

Had they added a headphone jack, wireless charging Or an SD card slot (or all three) they would have dominated the foldable phone war round one.

Not a fan of this method, but i keep watching lew later (not as often since this unbox therapy INSULT!!!) good day

too bad it&#39;s only for verizon.

Super soft screen, exposed hinge gears, dirty pockets, what could go wrong.

Damn, the end of flip phone jokes.

Mass entry with flip open... hope they spread it out in colours...

wtf you are see on this its baisic shit mobile with that you can fold that thats all)¨

Holy fucl i jist noticed it&#39;s made in india. We&#39;re getting ahead in electronics manufacturing huh.

Plz switch to this phone!!!

im honestly more interested in the brand of pants the commentator is wearing?

Motorola is fine
Trash!!

This is gonna be my cheat phone.  Side bitches only.

He didn’t do classic mode
You forgot the hidden Razr menu ;)

OMG! made in india

Fun fact: in the secret settings you can change the format of the phone to be the iconic original razr display.

There is no way in hell I would buy that overpriced phone the camera sucks the hump at the bottom of the phone gets in the way after using it a while it will get creases in or near the fold my brother has one a he hate it after he let me use it I can see why if you only care about looks and not function this may be your phone

Just got a phone call after watching this and wanted to flip close my LG V30 :(

No 3,5mm audio  no buy,   sorry iFruit following bastards i&#39;m not buying into the push

But battery is too low

It is the most waited phone of the decade! And its predecessor was only launched like a decade ago.

Everyone on the entire planet owned a razor in 3rd grade

Too positive view, overly appreciating everything

What a software made which gives a button phone setup to this phone which will be really super cool for old people

all they have to do is make it pink and I&#39;m sold

its just a gimmick..not many people going to buy it..those chins &amp; bezels looks ancient

Verizon?!! Oh yes!

Unless Motorola drastically changed their software issues, it&#39;s just a flashy and vain show.

Am about to get one of these bad boys flip it on yall 

its miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine..this Valentine&#39;s
See, THIS is the sort of phone I&#39;d be happy to have! Unlike the previous ones I used to have which were shit lol

I bet sheared screen will get stuck

I want one.

I love moto

If you had the original razr, this new razr has a Easter egg to make it look like a original razr

<a href="">1:09</a>

Looks cool but what kinda case would you use??? Nice phone

<a href="">1:10</a> attempted Mariah Carey whistle note

The fact that you’re able to use the main camera to take selfies is gonna be a game changer.

Sooo boossy looks

Dude it broke- like the new test online shows that it broke after a couple hundred flips like the Samsung fold it failed  which kinda sucks cuz I liked it

$1500.00 worth of fun

John wick 3 : I came back from the dead. Motorola: I was never dead.

I want this phone

...definitely want 1, but cnt afford as they are now,  hoping in a year or 2 or 3 the pricing drop to acceptable level ($900below  ) , hope it follows what happened with pop up  cameras.  Remember findX hw expensive and now u get pop ups with huaweis mid/low sample phone Y7prime,  price very affordable.

I am all for the flip phone revival

Just use 2 screens please.

<a href="">1:09</a> Did anybody let the air of a baloon out?

<a href="">0:03</a> How many phones do you need!?

5 mp 16 mp disgusting and 2099  dollars 2500map battery ridiculous

Bro, you should hang up angrily with one hand then toss it on the table!

Happy to know that it&#39;s Made In India and moreover it&#39;s unboxed and reviewed  by &quot;Unbox Therapy&quot;🇮🇳 🇺🇸 🇨🇦

It&#39;s a shame. These phones are beautiful looking but at the end of the day they are just trying to cash in on the popularity of the old Razer. They are so poorly made. The ones at Walmart didnt last 3 days on display. Some people have even reported owning it just one day and the screen has broken already. Such a shame to release it before its ready

Ever since I got the g7 power I&#39;ve been a huge fan of motorola more than any other brand. I was a huge fan of the Google pixel series but the phone quality went down

If we&#39;re going back to foldable,  is BlackBerry keyboard, next? ... would consider this in Canada, if it&#39;s not on a plan.

Thank for the efficient review! It only took me <a href="">2:23</a> minutes to learn that I’m not buying this phone (no mini Jack = no money from mee to Motorola).

If you go in the secret settings, you can turn the phone into it&#39;s retro (2008) skin.

So... it’s a flip phone.

Rarely and I mean RARELY do I get excited by a new phone release, in fact the last time I showed any interest in a new phone was when the iPhone first came out,  but I have to say this looks quite interesting . The future has arrived it’s here...one to beam up!I guess the big question though is how well the screen is going hold up over time.

I like it. I want one.

I want one now !!!!

made india?  no more china lol
6gb ram? What? Imma wait a bit until the price drop and get it since no one really cares for this hype so i wont look like a douche buying latest iphone soon as it dropped

Damn if I didn&#39;t preorder my note 10+ I would&#39;ve definitely bought this. I had an original razr and it was by far my favorite phone ever.

update the phone can fold 27000 times before breaking up with clicking noises...in other words overpriced garbage

The plant is so famous

What a garbage phone. $1500 for a phone with $300 specs, a screen that can scratch with your fingernail, and dust will get into your device without effort. Over what? &quot;Uh, it folds.&quot;

I&#39;m fine wit my galaxy fold... I&#39;m always watching your unboxing videos you my favorite Youtuber

I missed this kind of unboxing :)

Made in India, whaaaaaaattttt

use METRIC pal, what the F are iNcHes?

...but 1700 - 1900, that&#39;s ridiculous.

Everybody gangsta until motorola wakes up after an eternity

This is a rip off if ever I saw one. It is a 300 dollar phone, but you need to pay another thousand plus because it folds. It has a mundane camera, a boring chip set,  a narrow screen, for close to fifteen hundred. If and when a new form factor arrives make sure the specs are solid. I understand why the other foldables are popular, you get top specs and a phone and tablets in one. This is like a mid range Nokia with a gimmick, it folds. There&#39;s no new form here, it just folds for no other purpose than it&#39;s not so hot, looks

Coolest phone ever
So do they use KY jelly when they fuck us on the $1500.00 cost on buying that phone ?

You didn&#39;t show us the retro mode

Dava Jonas stonks
I hate this Razr. Better, I hate it&#39;s price. I need one!

I don&#39;t think your employees like you very much. Imagine working for someone that full of himself. It would probably be a nightmare.

<a href="">2:28</a> <b>Are we having fun yet?</b>

If that phone was a woman I&#39;d kiss her!Only gamers get it

I love it

how much motorola pay you?

My Phone My Phone This is What I Call I PHONE.

that box looks like a speaker

Heap of shit lol

The only thing i dont like about this phone is that it is has an only 2510mAh battery

<a href="">9:10</a> obligatory double tap

Wish it was cheap enough to be my trap phone

An SDM710 processor though? Flagships should have flagship processors. Clear compromise there though this piece is catering more to style than say gaming performance.

Android users put up with the biggest piles of shit?! 

If someone not noticed “ITS MADE IN INDIA” bitch!!

Honestly cool phone 

Wish it wasn’t made in india. would have bought two. made in india is worse than made in China. Already it was sad that iphone was made in China. Can anyone confirm if any other country is manufacturing moto razr apart from india?

Just like the prices of all these unfinished, poorly optimized and micro transaction filled AAA games... We just need to refuse to buy this thing until the price drops. I get it wasnt cheap to engineer but $1500 is stupid.

$ 1600 for a Snapdragon 712, only 128gb of storage and one single miserable camera on the back, Motorola has oficially gone nuts ‍️

I hope this works out for Motorola, I mean i want them to success lol just because they are such a nostalgic brand

You buy it, then you flip it.

Hhhmmm nice like a new throwback... Awesomeness like the look and the performance (“

But can you hang up by closing it

<a href="">1:09</a> wtf was that

Cool vids

Relax its just a phone nothing special you only use it to call people, And what idiot would spend $500+ on a phone for 500$ you can take a nice vacation to EU people are not smart this days stuck up!!!

Ok but how do you use snapchat selfie on there? That’s my only question 

Motorola Made in India... Shiiiiv..... Sold ..dyamn!!!!!

When the phone is open, does the screen click/lock into place ?

I would buy that just for the box.. that box looks so cool

Okay, I've decided on this! If it’s 500,000 won!
you can literally lift a side of the screen off with your finger tip by the hinge with a big opening since the the screen is not attached to the back. This is a massive problem for any dust. Way worse than the Fold. I don&#39;t know why no one was talking about it. Probably because it&#39;s an American company. But I highly doubt this will ever hit the market before any major redesign. I think Samsung was right.

I had the Motorola v3 and the v3i and v3x and v3xx and v3 Max I had them from 2004 two 2007 then went to the Nokia n96 from 2007 two 2008 till the iPhone I love the nastolgia off phones I’ve had as a very young teen just like Nokia 3310 but I don’t miss using them I’d rather the iPhone because that Motorola is more expensive then iPhone 11 Pro Max top spec $200 more expensive then iPhone  I like the look off the retro design but I have not looked back I’ve stayed with Apple since 2008 never going to another brand ever

i&#39;m not sure this kind of &#39;folding&#39; is practical.

Moto Razr 2020 is just stupid chiness cheap pone!! there is noting to Look Forward to

I heard this is $1600 

Has this phone got a Force Field to keep drunken fighters away on a Saturday Night.

This phone is 2700 AUD (1800 USD) NO FARKING THANKYOU. For that I can buy 2 s10+ and still have change left over

2:3:5-1 8k is the future. But not for another decade!

The new &quot;scoba fold 2&quot; is an almost exact replica of the famous &quot;galaxy fold&quot;.

girlfriend call: hang up

So why don&#39;t you spend the same amount of money and get an iPhone 11promax?

Breaks fast
WANT, WANT, WANT...

I want it with a pocket clip

Price?

is it true that only Verizon has the privileges?

How is the screen work?

Made in India. Where is China?

Would love to buy this phone but it just feels so risky to spend so much money on a screen that folds. I&#39;m still not convinced on their reliability.

Funny when the razor first came out I was too poor to buy one, nice to know nearly 2 decades later..<b>I still can&#39;t afford one</b>

beautiful

Do I want this as much as I think I do?

I’ll probably get the second version of it but I like how you can use the main camera as the selfie camera like eff a selfie camera 

I want the razor SO bad-

Wooooooow

Loved it up until <a href="">4:29</a>, then it was ugh! 

revolutionary...hello moto !
Thats so cooooooooool!!!$!!

I had the very first Razr when it came out as a kid....I went from that phone to an iPhone 4....9 years after that I’m very tempted to go back to this beauty again. It was a magical phone growing up and I can feel the magic again as an adult!

Can I please have that phone

Apple 2025: the all new iPhone XV with ground breaking new foldable screen tech and USB C (dongle).Apple fanboys: OMG, it&#39;s amazing unlike any Android!!!....$3500.00

I really don’t have much confidence in the screen design for the razr, I’m not being a hater, I was actually rooting for this to be a hit but after what I saw with the display model they put up at my local Walmart, I can easily say this screen is just as bad if not worse than the galaxy folds, they literally just put the razr on display at Walmart less than a week ago &amp; the screen is already broken at the hinge section, it even makes a weird noise when you open &amp; close it, I can’t be for certain if it’s the phone’s design or if it was a faulty model or if someone intentionally messed with it so much it broke but if you were thinking about getting this I’m gonna be real honest with you, it’s 100% not worth it at all not even for the flex factor, I’d say the galaxy fold is a far better option, this is coming from someone who wasn’t very enthusiastic about the fold to begin with, but after they’ve made some tweaks to it I think it’s worth giving a second glance at least.

<a href="">1:09</a> that silly look  because we know he need to monetize it  so let’s go to 10mn length 

He squealed

Its made in india 
Made in india ! Nice !

My Note 9 still rocks.
The only problem I have with this is that you can actually lift the display off the hardware with your bare hands from the hinge. There are no attachments or dust proofing what so ever. It’s bound to break when stuff get in between, like the first galaxy fold that went into recall.

Made in India - but it&#39;s not available Indian market

If it was 600$ then maybe

The past and present is here...

Thumbs up, Awesome!

Android user will say &quot;Still no 3.5mm jack&quot;.

The form is bad
wow wow wow.. i absolutely want that beast

Kids these days will be thinking folding phones are a new thing 

He is consistantly making us stare at someone else&#39;s package, this time for a prolonged period of time. lol

And there is one feature that everyone missed: it&#39;s also a money clipper

Does it have desktop mode like the dex

Don’t waste your money  1600 cos it folds ? Get a life .. made in India for 10$

that guy in the background knows everything about the phone. why isn t he making the review? lol

I wish they&#39;ll make a 16:9 screen version. Waaay better to watch movies, videos, or any content in landscape mode.

What is that  @<a href="">1:10</a>

They should make a rectangle version and not rounded or sum

UGLy

1500$ for that?Hell no

Made in india wooo that looks pretty awesome  I

$1500?!?!?!  No thanks

...until the Galaxy Z flip

How about video calls with it? And wireless buds

I think I want one

cool

Genuinely the most interesting phone for 10 years.

Nice music in the end: The 126ers - End Of Summer (Instrumental)

You’re such a shill it’s embarrassing.

This vs lets say..a note 10 plus or 11 pro max or the new galaxy line about to come out ?? Nah..I&#39;ll pass

Surprised you didn’t damage it chucking it on the table lol

OMG 
I actually want this past-future

Damn!!! I thought Motorola was as dead a Palapatine from Star Wars but I guess not. They both came back with a little punch. Too expensive for my taste though.

Super old school phone in 2020

Given that I no longer have a packet of cigarettes or an iPod .....I wonder what I’ll do with the extra pocket space.

best phone

Hmmmm, i think it&#39;s kinda hard to touch around the chin area. Especially you need to swipe from the edge.

Need this unlocked.

i have a feeling this phone will be the best for cheating in a test...

The phone costs way too much! I will just remember when I had the raspberry one when it first came out! Someone stole the phone but the joke was on them because two numbers didn’t work on the phone

You gotta have a big ego to play a video of yourself in your own tutorial  video lol

&quot;Verizon exclusive&quot;Yeah that sounds like a big &#39;fuck you&#39;No thanks &gt;.&gt;

Recreating an old phone is a prefect idea, well done Motorola

Does Lew wheeze ironically?

Forgot 1 thing old school style

<b><i>Apple: Flip phones are outdated</i></b><b><i>Motorola: Hold my beer</i></b>

<a href="">1:09</a> i thought that was a koala.

This phone is almost 1600$ no way. Just no way.

In the words of flossy carter,  that price is TOO GODDAM HIGH!

Had a razor years ago, was by far the most convenient and easiest phone to carry!

I love this. I will buy this phone in 2030

Production is not possible due to display issues.
Hello Moto
It&#39;s cool but I&#39;m still sticking with my unfoldable phone

Me: Mom I want a new phone....Mom:  okay... But I&#39;m gonna buy you a folding phone thenMe: Ikay deal. Buy me a Motorola Razr Mom: 

It&#39;s not $1500 fun though..

expensive phone on midrange performance.. single camera.. no GSM... still sucks though.. but has future potential

Motorola is taking over!!! Their features and functions are second to none. They are constantly innovating, I will forever be a Motorola owner.

the device is brilliant

<a href="">5:19</a> - That&#39;s what she said.

I just love this phone! I&#39;m al nostalgic since I&#39;ve had Motorola StarTac a long time ago and this phone is something i definetly want... Will It be available for Europe? Thanks for answer...

I like how the other guy just sits in the chair ever video and only ever says 1 or 2 things the whole time

Yes yes yes yes!! Phones have been getting so BORING lately, this is exactly the kind of drama I need in my life. Bring me that fucking flip

Snapping the phone shut when someone fucks you off. Fuck you! Snap!! Reason enough to get one of these!!

&quot;Made In India&quot;

My local Walmart just put one of these phones in for display yesterday and the screen is already broken

As I&#39;m watching this in my new Motorola razr

That’s tight

What a shill!

Damn that looks like a flip phone from the 80&#39;s. Probably the ugliest phone on this channel.

Woody: Cum on guys! Wheezy: <a href="">1:09</a>

Samsung is still better. Lol

<a href="">8:10</a>

Welp. I know what I&#39;m upgrading to.

<a href="">1:10</a> 

Want to see effect of fold after a few months... drop test

I like it

Razr....when I left you I was but a learner....now I am the Master..

My first smart phone was a Blackberry Curve

The only thing that is the same is the shape and the chin.

It&#39;s a flip phone but bigger

Good job on reviewing. Its a reasonable phone that folds into a tiny device, which is its main feature. Most reviewers forget this aspect.

May i have the wallpaper seen at <a href="">4:30</a>, anyone knows where I can get it?  Thanks.

&quot;Thats the whole pocket&quot;

Omg I always loved razor phones I&#39;m so old school I want this lol

His laugh tho I thought my mom was cleaning my window 

Where can I get it and how much it cost

The Visual OCD is satisfied 
i need this

This phone cost as much as the iPhone 11 pro max 560gb and this phone has 126gb...

Now this is the first thing motorola has done right in the past 7 years.

This does look amazing as hell. Price is so high though. Wouldn’t it be smart to not have it be so expensive

Remember when bar phones were basic phones and flip phones were king?  We’ll......

Flip phones in 2020 is tight.

Are there compatible cases for this yet? Also, did you use it for a regular day type use, if so how was it as far as use and durability?

Moron.

This phone will cost at least Rs 20 thousand.
Wow .. I just love it

Lew and Will sittin in a tree......

I had a black berry when it came out I remember the commercials saying “ SMART PHONE “

You better care about St. Louis. My dad wants a touch screen flip phone bad. He thinks he came up with the idea lol

Bro watch at <a href="">1:09</a>

Dear Sir have you know that  wifi calling feature will not be available for 6Z in any future updates because, it&#39;s hardware not supported that feature. I got confirmation from Asus technical support team it&#39;s really fell cheated

Bring back the SideKick

You have to kidding me

is there an actual internal camera? Looking for ability to facetime or duo an older relative.

Ooooooh am felt so happy that even lu gets to see his own channel adsThese things are becoming soo annoyingBasically ads are taking over unbox therapy Not just ut but the whole YouTube itself

Will this phone work on Sprint network?

Yeah but the annoying thing would be your finger will be pinched in the part that makes it bend

Unbox the LG rebel 4

Well no more iPhone gang

I soooo want this phone...

$1.500 for this Motorola made in india owned Chinese ? U gotta be kidding!I’m happy with my iPhone 11 Pro 

Number of demand for this phone = 0

How about for gaming??? How does it feel on the hand??

I think I&#39;m ready for this. I spend way to much time on my phone already. It would be nice to have something far easier to carry around that makes me think twice about pulling it out to look at some bullshit.

$1600, For 1/2 the phone as a Samsung Galaxy 10+ feature wise at $1100. Pass. As a gimmick it&#39;s a neat device, neat to show your friends etc . But after the newness wears out, and you begin to see where it folds in the center of the screen? As a practical up to date device, nope. You&#39;ll be happier in the long run with a Samsung Galaxy or an I-Phone for 2/3 the price.

<a href="">1:10</a>

$1500 and only available for Verizon. Stupid

<a href="">3:10</a> what was that

Business Insider already reporting this phone is sold-out and backordered until February 18th. Looks like A LOT of interested buyers already!

Lovely 2×Galaxy s 10+ for the same money

I did have the original Razor and it was a fantastic phone.  I&#39;ll wait until Samsung introduces their version of a foldable phone but for now I&#39;ll keep my Note 10+

Can u game on it
will this be available for T- mobile eventually?

I like how you can tell what this guy thinks about these gadgets by the look on his face in the thumbnail! Like an emoji!!

What good is any review without a price?

I’m buying it!

Samsung:man this foldable screen cannot be done. Motorola: hold my beer .

I would rather a slide keyboard

A couple of boxes 

Slamm shutt end call....flip phone open BUSTED ASS SCREEN!

Battery has to be crap. Too small phone.2. People will hate you if you have a folding phone in 2020.3. The tact does not feel nice.

Now available on Verizon pre-order, for the low low price of 1,499 bucks, or 65ish a month....got daymn!

I hate how you mention all specs for the big name brands but I watched this whole this and got no idea still how much ram it has. Or the resolution or anything.

Consooooooom hnnnnnggggg I&#39;m consoooooommmmiiiinnnnggggg

REAL NICE...

I love Motorola, not for inventing the folding phone, but for perfecting it.

Pls bring this to Philippines!!!! Pls pls pls waAah

how is gaming on this device ?

Verizon is the deal killer!

If the foldable screen technology was matured a bit more this would be my dream phone.

How would you protect this phone? What case? Screen protectors? Like how? I can&#39;t imagine me buying a brand new phone w/o protection? Verizon only? PASS 

Use it as your daily driver

Everyone gangsta til someone has a Moto razr 2019

Grandpa don’t feel bad about your flip phone, I just bought one too !Thank you Motorola for re- introducing a modern 2020 flip phone which is comfortable in the pockets once again !

The only thing bugging me are the bumps on the screen...I really want it though!!!

What about a video call???Do you have to close the phone to do video call. ?? Not good.

Is my video quality good, or is the phones camera quality good?

I hate when he says jack

I will only buy if it is from Apple.

Motorola: ......mic drop     
omg yes

<a href="">1:09</a>

<a href="">9:23</a> ...exclusive here??? Where this guy at?

I want one...! Badly...

I love it, I want one.

Cool!

Made in INDIA

FINALLY a made in INDIA Product @ <a href="">9:33</a>

This phone is awesome. 

Made in India and still no launching in India

2020 - crap

Made in India!? I don&#39;t think average Indian folk can afford this phone

Google needs to1) hire new designers to design a really good looking2) focus more on the design than inside first.. 3) try to do the same price with iphone or lower google is good at making money on advertising and their stocks are going up but they have no good team on phones.. they need to focus on this sector more if they want to compete with iphone or samsung

The phone is Ugly and Expensive. It is 1,500. I dont know what are they thinking. If google wants to compete with Samsung or Iphone, THEY NEED to fire old designers and HIRE new designers.  If u look at all Google phones, their designs are ugly. That is why i never touch it at all. I do want to support their phones but they need to redesign it.

Just ordered one. Done. Can’t wait!

I&#39;m tired of the slick phones that slide right out of your hand ...2  what about internal memory and external memory?

this guys a fucking moron

So its future&#39;s Past huh!

foldable for retards

It&#39;s not 2019. It is the cellphone to have in 2020

Rip kobe

Say wat you want I&#39;m getting one‍️
Screen replacement for &quot;only&quot; 300 buckaroos? Dude, that is literaly the price of most non flip phones that have all the functionalities anyone could look for in a phone. Either way, the big question is: how many folds and flips can that screen take before you need to replace it for those measly 300 bucks?

Wowv

That has got to be the most badass smart phone design ever! I love how it folds and protects the screen. Omg I love it! I miss slamming my phone shut in a fit of rage. Buh bye! <b>snap</b>

Motorola has postponed the Razors release four times. I don’t think it will be available till 2021.

I want it.But it&#39;s too expensive...

Having to advertise ur own 12$ case u sell for 50$ ur just a fucking loser I fucking hate this guy Fuck u

Im not a fan about foldable smartphones, but this is dope

<b>This is the future of the past</b>

Its like my grandmas phone but better

iPhone 7,8,9 or aka 12,x,xr,11.....same fuckin design.all year same shit phone -iphone

So bitch ass dumb fucks Motorola is a great company no fuckin iPhone

Ok mfkers who smart ass know when was created as a company “Motorola”, and why the police use it.

<a href="">1:10</a> What does the the Dolphin say?

When she sucked you dry <a href="">1:09</a>

that&#39;s actually sick asf

<a href="">8:17</a> Ultimate Satisfaction.

Tell me what this is <a href="">1:09</a>

I think for the price, given that others similar are now over $1,500, it&#39;s doable. However, the exclusive Verizon launch is not something I like. Well, I guess I will WAIT!

Hinge design was done really well.

we know jack now

If got 1

Apple will bring foldable and slim phone probably in 2050 or even later because their development has gone with Steve, after the whole year they brought stupid shit that is more like baby toy phone which is also from 1800 bc or whatever. I loved iphone but now that they have gone dumb what else to say. RIP iphone

I want 1 
<a href="">1:10</a>

He should admit how much he’s paid to pretend he likes a product.His loyalty is for sale.

would definetly get it if it was half the price

The razr should make the <a href="">1:09</a> sound everytime  you open it.

I wish Apple would make something like this.

I&#39;m worried about software update reliability. Motorola is k own for having one of the worst update track records.

<a href="">01:09</a> Ivan Dorin ? Is that you inside him ?

You haven’t flipped in a while... I felt that!! I also had that same reaction! I loved my razr, that one handed flip was everything!!!

It’s very nice and have cool features but I’m not switching from iPhones. $1500 or $63per month. I’m good.

Omg im now Razer 2 and i eould own this so soon

Moto razr 
Razer should make a phone called Motorla

unfortunately foldable screens are all oled and oled have problems with burn in

When will it be available in India????

How would you put a case on it?

<a href="">1:09</a> his laugh can cure canser 

Recently I got a cellphone and I want to have one 
made in india?

Made in India shit wtf That’s gonna be bad quality

<a href="">1:09</a> <b>that wheeze tho</b>

<a href="">9:19</a> Made in India. Great

Wow 
This guy clearly got paid for this by Motorola.   for you sir

No one:My door: <a href="">1:09</a>

Why the hell does such a thing as e-sim exist? It&#39;s sounds so stupid. Why do consumers put up with this stuff in the US?

I just see this thing and I&#39;m worried it&#39;s going to snap in half

They should have put a wireless charger in the dock

I wonder how much $ razr sent for a good review

All of them are making very good inovation, expect Samsung... They dont have good ideeas, they just sleep, afk... Something like that for over 3 years.

I cracked up when he puts it inside his pocket 

Wow big companyOf Motorola

Who wouldnt love to pay 20  usd more for his phone because it comes in a fancy box, right?

Looks like I can only buy shaving razr

Damn that thing looks good

Siiick

<a href="">1:09</a>

Motorola always have amazing packaging skills

stop testing the sound with your f videos man!

that phone would be toast if you dropped it

Slip phone omg.. reminds me of the erricson slip phone

<a href="">2:07</a> first mistake ever made by you...

I wish I could Hv a tab for college notes on my B-Day this MaRch but m broke 

Apple: We’re making a come back with a phone with 3 camerasMotorola: Bet

Is there going to be a case for it?

Wow I’m so excited I love this Motorola Iobile I have coming soon

Meh I&#39;m waiting for the Microsoft Duo.

If I was on Verizon and wasn&#39;t on the Apple bandwagon for the last 12 years, sign me up. My only questions are if it&#39;s compatible with wireless charging or bluetooth headphones

<a href="">1:11</a> his laugh sounds like a teapot

I want it
I have a Motorola which I got for Christmas

is this fone is launching in india?

Made in india. Proud of it.

Hai, whats the price?

Shitiest phone I have ever seen look at the display <a href="">5:20</a> yakkk . I feel sorry for mot at least make it cheap .

They don’t means em like me no more.

Now incognito has been better?

Man I love it..................I want one!

<a href="">9:46</a> Those measurements seem awfully familiar to something... Can&#39;t put my finger on it.

Can that stuff use a tampler glass or anything else of screen protectors ???

:/

Made in india are u kidding me I am not able to find this in indian stores

I want it so much.  But price! Wtf

Only one camera in 2020 ooouuuuhhhh :(

<a href="">9:36</a> made in India

this is just next gen of flip phone

Motorola are the pioneers in cell phones

Why does the camera guy sound like bootyclapkc

Price iss availability in Pakistan

Can screen guard be installed to that? Or there&#39;s no need.

wow, I thought StarTrek the first few movies were wrong!  But now we find they really did know the future.

The correct way to pronounce “ hello moto” was “ herro mottoh”

In 2004 I had used Samsung flip phone and in 2003 I had used Motorola razor.

How to put some jelly case ?

<a href="">9:34</a> made in India!

How much is it. No more Galaxy or iPhone for me. Went back to Motorola a yr ago . Love it ! Awesome Battery life. Killer Pictures. Video not to good .

Getting the GBA Sp vibes here

I love the sound in <a href="">1:09</a>

I kinda really wanna cop this

It will be flop cause of battery mAh

When opened up,,does it go completely flat? IT didnt look like to would.

Its ugly and impractical lol

I wish I can have this phone. But I know it&#39;ll only happen in my dreams tho.

Android ?
Ok. I love it! I hope they release it in more colors, I’d totally buy a neon green version of this! I’m hoping that the second generation of this version comes with better hardware and additional colors so I can buy it! AND WE NEED THE HELLO MOTO COMMERCIALS PLEASE!!!!!!

Me:sees the Motorola razr 2019 s price. Also me:buys a Motorola razr v3

the only thing that worries me with this phone is that the pixels on the folding part will break after a couple of years.. .. .

Your laugh 

Where is my iPhone

If Steve Jobs was alive. We woulda already had a flip open iPhone by 2020. Mark. My. Words!

Motorola: Omae Wa Mou Shinderu
Who else was randomly recommended this video, btw it is so satisfying to watch.

Wow... I 
I was so envious of kids in my elementary school who had razors.  I want this phone but I have AT&amp;T...

But it would be problem for gamers... When we play...it will try to close

How the hell did Motorola beat Apple to this?!?

I had the Original RAZR (before I started going crazy for BlackBerry). Great phone for the time of flip phones. Nice up to date version.

What’s the price tag? 13,000 dollars? Like most stuff on this channel lol

“It Feels like the Future”No I’m pretty sure Flip phones were introduced in 2006

This phone is very hot  would like to try it out

When person come from stone age to 2020 his reaction would be same as him......

Motorola is back at the game 

Love that phone !!

Ye yea I haven&#39;t flipped in a while 

Makes sense pain in the ass putting big phones in pocket

Maaaan because of your overaction i didn&#39;t even watch the video completely, now i have to find another video of this phone, A hole

$700-800? maybe. $1500 ?  No, thanks!

Everyone: I thought you were deadMotorola: My death was... merely exaggerated

It feels odd Watching On IPhone11

Price???

GB SP like shit

After very long there is something new in phone world

<a href="">9:35</a> I am proud of an indian 🇮🇳 (and Love to all other nations)

<a href="">1:09</a> the sound then the face he makes after realizing he made this sound kills me :D :D

When I slowly let air out of a balloon <a href="">1:10</a>

ı like this phone

Made in India

Motorola and Verizon have been stating for months that this phone would be pre order Dec 26 and available Jan 9. I have been trying and calling Verizon weekly trying to get an update to buy one. Their delay is seeming to be a blessing in disguise!!! I have just heard and seen today that Samsung is coming out soon with a flip phone that is claiming to beat the Razr in battery life price and quality. I am now on hold to see what is coming out. I think Motorola dropping the ball on their release date is going to bite them big time as I would have bought one in a second but now major manufactures are coming out with flip phones, I&#39;m on hold to compare.

its made in india

What&quot;s the song name at the end ?

Made In INDIA.  
I read &quot;made in india&quot;

Allot bla bla bal worse unboxing ever

<a href="">5:00</a>-<a href="">5:20</a> That&#39;s it, I&#39;ve won by that.

Its made in India. Now thats cool 

When everybody is laughing and u don&#39;t even know what they r laughing at but u try laugh as if u know what&#39;s happening <a href="">1:09</a>

I can&#39;t find this phone online, how much is it?

Good thing, its not made in China

So is this the same guy who ripped off people with ripped off phone cases?

Definitely getting one of these! I’ve been itching for a RAZR for a while now!

Does anyone have this phone? Do you love it? Should I get one?

<a href="">1:10</a> what animal makes that noise

Did this ever come out or did it flop ?

Go subscribe to my YouTube channel I do gaming videos my YouTube channel isexcel gang make sure you subscribe

For around 1500 dollars not bad

The best phone in the world

Generation Z does not know that flip phones existed in 90&#39;s . RAZR is a hybrid.

Too bad only Verizon

fuck you samsung, and fuck your bixby

... but that gigantic notch (especially in landscape mode)

Will there be a smart watch with this?

This will definitely be my next phone in a year or two when the specs will be upgraded

Made in India.

Its the future in you pocket....durability of 12 months?maybe smartphone flat rate new trash every year or so

Proud to see the made in India symbol 

So what phone do you own right now? Im trying to get a perfect phone but dont know wich one

What&#39;s the price??

I think it safe to say that 1, I had a razor phone and the the mototorola flip phone that came before it. But 2, me and Doctor Disrespect needs 2 razor 2019s in red and mabe a gold

JACK!!!! <a href="">7:31</a>

That&#39;s a Made in India phone. It has to be ergonomical!!

If u close it to fast it will just brake

Yes but does the Razr still have the capability to shut off a phone call as soon as you click it shut? This is the million dollar question here ladies and gentlemen

..im getting one

The future for fold phones should be like this, rather than Huawei nor Sumsong.

What a load of bollocks. People getting all nostalgic wanting phones like this to come back...may as well leave it in the past.

good luck with chinese BOA display, this phone will have same faith as huwawie mate x.

I want one 

AHAHAHA

YO THATS SO SICK!!!!!!!!

everytime it opens i just expect there to be this nasty crease through the middle.

<a href="">4:48</a> Not even 16M subs youtubers are paying for Youtube premium xd

Cynicism made man
OMG that dock and the cable case is so thoughtful and coooool!!

If only MOTOROLA teamed up with IOS :(

Nice phone but the problem its android IOS is the one and only good operating system :C

How i wish this phone becomes available in the Philippines as well. That phone is ONE IN A MILLION
