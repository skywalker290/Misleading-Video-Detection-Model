Anyone here watching it during the 2023 WC?

Qdk is an underrated wicket keeper

Fantanlous faf
Du plessis and de Villiers 

Heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to Faf du Plessis from our country for his brilliant innings.
eNGILSH

Very good match
Unluckiest team ever in CWC history..SA.

Best World Cup To Date 
SA is like Pakistan, they play their best when no pressure.

Morne Morkel took retirement in 2018 along with ABD, the next year there was the World Cup and Steyn played 2 matches as a starter and then got a shoulder injury. What is his luck?

De cock is the best wicket keeper

Van der dussen ,tristan stubbs and dewald brevis and bavuma are the future of sa . Quinton de kock is the current best batsman but he cant do alone anything as du plessis is not playing 2023 wc too

Van der dussen sixes are ️
<a href="">3:40</a> quick stumping
Miss you faf in csk
<a href="">5:18</a> That six from starc

I was literally watching the session of faf&#39; s batting. I wish SA cricket could have utilised him better. He is simplified classic

Nepal will never forget the ACC contribution to Nepal cricket

My second fav team ️️
<a href="">4:42</a> that catch faf

I love SA cricket team 
faf is also a one of the good pl ayer for sa but he did not get that kind of honour in sa team

I am watching for faf

Please ab devillers come back for south africa top order really needs you 

South Africa batting fledging awesome

South africa played very well in this match I think faf du plesis is very defensive captain like Williamson Sometimes South Africa played Orthodox cricket in world cup matches instead of play extraordinary game because you are playing in world cup matches .I feel said for south Africa for another failure in world cup I hope they will back in 2023 world cup with solid team and give tough competition to every opposite team Love from india ️🇮🇳️🇮🇳

Who cares about this win. I’ve been an SA supporter since 92. And we are shocking at WC. Especially this World Cup. It was our worst. And this game just rubbed salt In the wound

This match South Africa performance is good

Plz upload  2015 wcw semifinal match.

the end of sa

How khawaja got out ? 
I love indian cricket team 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Van der Dussen is underrated.
Some great person said once: &quot;All well that ends well&quot;

Tipical south africa 

He came in the era when ABD and Hashim where on the peak of their careers and simply he was overshadowed

Match that caused wc for Australia and India, if Australia could have won situation could have been different 

Nice

<a href="">5:18</a> this dude can do anything 

Let&#39;s take a moment and appreciate Alex carey for his innings

Warner&#39;s hundred was a great knock..

<a href="">4:03</a> flying  Great

<a href="">3:00</a> what happened to Khwaja ?

<a href="">2:54</a> Express on its way

Fad wicket

AUs

Ven der dussen is well well played
South Africa always shows their real quality against Australia

Sa are wasting faf he should defenetly be in the odi side .he is fit and can play for 3 more years I think.they can build a team around him probably.bavuma is not having a set team.

so 
<a href="">

Van der also a impressed batsman

<a href="">4:03</a> That catch 

Abd ex titan
Warner,s 122 is super batting

Faf du plesis fav player  oll tym
South Africa will definitely Bounce Back no problem if the legends have retired the youth will definitely come up...

<a href="">3:38</a> skills of dhoni

SA is always a nightmare for Australia

South Africa &#39;s feliding is always amazing!

Nice match ️
I wish van dur dussen was in his early 20. Cause would have loved to see him play the ongoing decade. He is my favourite batsman of SA team.

Pakistan is a best

Love from india.

South Africa you have disrecpeted Hashim Amla in his last cwc why you didn&#39;t add in the team instead of makram we could see the last match oh him

Why khawaja gone

true op bhai bilkul sahi kha
I think SA loves to beat Australia. Even 438  target can&#39;t stop them

<a href="">1:43</a> Why is Alex Carey standing close to the stumps when a fast bowler is bowling



Where is the wicket of duplesis

I like the way markram plays he is so confident and aggressive

New Zealand ️
The bat sounds 

Faf du plesis very good batting
warner loves to score against south africa isn’t it?

This was the last match of JP Duminy

This match changed the semifinals situations...

Bro but ma chahata tha ki amla uska wc ka last match khela because he was a very great player

CWC - Cook with comali 

According to my opinion man of the match goes to de cock because sent pavilion to both hard hitter Stoinis and Maxwell very brilliantly.

If abd was there then it would be 375

Faf duplesis we miss u sir
South Africa . What a match

Rassie van der dussen is best odi test batsman ️️️
SA the only team in the world cup who find it difficult to win matches but found it easy to win the against the five time world cup champions

thus man threre  thus man there... So 

this is the last odi of faf du plessis for south africa. after this he was never selected in odi team of africa

South africa is looking incomplete without stey, amla and superstar ABD

Sema match

Fabulous faf hitting back...to..back...
faf you are my fan and i was wondering why have yo never made a hundred in ipl history

<a href="">3:40</a> what a run out I remembered ms dhoni.

5.25 khwaja fir se waise hi out jaise vs India hua tha

Faf beauty with beast

Wish aus had won d match,then india wud hv faced England in semi final

Van der dussen 2ñd abd
Congratulations South Africa team but I am unhappy that Van Der Dussen couldn&#39;t complete his century.

South Africa missed Ab devillers Hashim Amla and Dale steyn

Look at England crowd cheering south African boundaries!!

<a href="">5:50</a> ENGLAND???? Australia

Faf
SA is ZERO without ABD. There is no match winner

Kya 2019 wc mein sabhi 10 teams ne ek dusre ke against match khele the kya?

Feeling so bad for vander rassi

Easily was aussies game

The innings of van der dussen was next level
Barring those fugging cancelled matches due to rain we&#39;ve seen really a quality worldcup with many interesting matches..

sa is good play

Awss

What happened to Khawaja , anybody ??

Fabulous innings by faf

Sa continue with decock,markaram,faf,dussen,Miller,phelukwayo,Morris,rabada,Steyn,tahir,standing.

I love tahir running after taking wicket
<a href="">5:22</a> This is what it means to hit an ax on your foot ???
Rassie van Der dussen is also ab devlliers for south Africa
Roses are Red  Violets are BlueThe moment you are here for is <a href="">1:22</a>

Well definitely one of the best and specially the tough  World Cup matches of all time South Africa always like to defeat Australia especially more in ODI rather than in tests this was one of the tough and likeable match of all time Australia would have also won this match like others but Khawaja who had an excellent partnership with Alex Carey in previous match against New Zealand at London in Lord&#39;s  but this time he got injured so that&#39;s why Australian chances became lower  to win  everybody did well Warner and Carey gave their best with David Warner hitting third century of the tournament right behind Rohit Sharma who is having 5  David Warner hitting third against South Africa but unfortunately all gone in vain as all matches were loss by  Australia faf du plessis and Rassie Van dersen did very well for team having 325 on board and in  reply Australia scoring 315 was definitely awesome nice match               Edit :                                                      Once again Starc - get bold by rabada as Boult against New Zealand.                                                        Starc : I feel it once again that when I get bold how others feel when they get hit by my yorkers

<a href="">4:41</a> Michael Clark: Get over! GET OVER! GET OVER!!!
<a href="">3:38</a> that&#39;s run out amazing

What happened when khwaja came at no. 3 and then i saw smith at 3 can anyone tell me?

I like the wicket keeping of decok

Sad for friend derDussen
Brilliant run out by de Kock

no danm reason of celebrating the century if can&#39;t be the match winner, i really hate warner

Tahir target to complete infinite km in ground

If warner didnt get out then aus would win that

I like faf batting style
If ABD Joins With South Africa Team (1) Auiden Markram (2) Q Decock (3) Faf Duplessis (4) AB De Villiers (5) Vander De Dussen.(6) David Miller (7) Chris Morris (8) Andel Pehluckwayo (9) Kagiso Rabada (10) Anrich Nortjea (11) Thabrej Shamsi
Dear South Africa, we are going against this too.
South africa won the world cup in this match by making them play England in semifinals!

<a href="">1:21</a> Charge! Yes and got him. Took a punch and it paid off big time.

Khawaja absence lead australia lose in semi

Ni cemathc

I remember when SA won the match all Indian fans were excited cuz we were versing NZ and it would be an ez win. But the rain had its own plans.

The catches were sooooo gud sa outstanding  innings

Hi ss

Van der dussen what a great player he is love from india

What a catch by de kock

Where is faf du plesis* wicket

No one is talking about Warner’s amazing hundred.

Pride was all they fought for in this match️

Faf du plessis  I love your batting and your  family  and baby  I am van der dussen I  live in  South Africa 🇿🇦

South Africa played well when they are tension free

Sorry no team has scored 500 in white ball cricket

When did Faf Dupleshi come out?
Whoever needs back support like sub quickly
These highlights by ICC make cricket even more fascinating game.

Legends watching 2021

Wow you plessis

Miss you legend Hashim amla
Good work
In 
X

that last ball shot from van der dussen was so good and inspiring. cummins bowled that short bouncer outside off stump just so that he couldn&#39;t hit it, but van der dussen judged it perfectly and timed his shot well just needed more power.

Marcus stonis should dive

Vander dussen ️
Brilliant contribution from de cock

How can a team like SA with such big names performs that poor in WC... This Match is a example what this team can do..

000001 you missed ab

<a href="">2:55</a> someone stop him

<a href="">2:31</a>
South Africa needs amla and de villiers

SA missing ABD very Badly 

<a href="">1:21</a> that shot reminded me new zealand&#39;s mccullum

why why sa you play like this during the whole tournament ??

I also

stoinis runout was awesome <a href="">3:45</a>

What happened to khwaja??

As a Pakistani I like Africans than Australians

Du plessis shots are very clean, pure and full of class.

Very good batting Faf du plessie
Wish abd and steyn were there

Thank You Faf...

Faf Du PlesisWorld Cup - Through the yearsThey say timing is everything in sport. It was timing that didn&#39;t allow Faf to go to England as a Kolpak player and it was again timing that got him a ticket for the 2011 World Cup in India. After marking his ODI debut against India with a composed 50 in January 2011, he continued his good form in the World Cup, notably steering his side to victory in a high-pressure run-chase against eventual World Champions, India.However, Faf is more known for running out his best mate AB de Villiers in the quarterfinal against New Zealand. The game was in the balance and de Villiers was set on 35 when Faf called him for a risky single. That wicket changed the course of the game and South Africa fell apart in their pursuit of 222. The C-word was once again thrown around.In 2015, Faf scored 380 runs and was only second to AB de Villiers for South Africa&#39;s leading run scorers. Even in the heartbreaking 2015 semifinal against New Zealand, Faf was the top scorer with 82. However, he could not prevent his country from being knocked out as Dale Steyn failed to defend 12 runs off the final over. Another World Cup and another opportunity missed.The 2019 edition saw Faf lead South Africa for the first time in the mega event. However, the Proteas had a forgettable tournament as they managed to win only three of their nine matches. Faf, personally, had a decent World Cup with the bat. He was the only South African to feature in the top-20 run-getters list. Faf amassed 387 runs in eight innings, which included a match-winning century against Australia in the final round-robin game of the tourney.

I took the risk dealing with Luiz to be in charge of my trade and finally end up with perfect testimony.his platform is amazing and very straightforward..

Nice performance from SA but VDD was so close to complete his century. But FDP completed his century. Australia has also played well but soo close to win.

<a href="">4:02</a> I see again again again and again what a caught by d kock

if ab de Villiers and Mark-Boucher   were there  then it was sure that south Africa will win the world cup or qualify to the semi- finals

When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2015 because the market outburst in December 2015 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2015 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this EXPERT KIRSTYFX DEAN  so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.I will advise all traders or newbie to invest in his amazing platform.Here is his contact via Tele gram: @Expert_kIRSTYFX.

Dussen underrated player
Please upload journey of Saturday double header matches in cwc 2019

Quinton de Lock and underrated WICKY

I loved this game despite mighty fall of PROTEAS IN THIS WC AND POST THIS.

How faf gone

Average australian side... Not good enough to retain world title....Previous teams hold record unbeaten from 1999-  2011 Beaten 3  times in world cup after 1992...?

I m happy for faf and sad for varden dussen

Decock well catch

A much needed win for proteas

I am sad of van deer dussen miss hundred
Hi

Proteas always give to tough time to Aussie in each single matchBut well-done proteas end with high node

South Africa is my favorite team

No one talk about Carey&#39;s 85

What happened to Khwaja?

and because of this we faced nz instead of england and we know what happened later

Fact :they did not show how faf du plessis got out!

I miss ab de Villiers my favorite batsman this world Cup and full time

<a href="">

<a href="">0:29</a> is very good shot

I want tell you my friend 2023 world cup SA 100%

Had Australia won this, they would have won the worldcup easily. They would have faced New Zealand in semis after winning this match.

Markaram for Amla was a better replacement, that changes there match

What the they won hahah are you kidding me

Duplesis  Great player
Hashim Amla and faf at top order, Abd and Miller at the middle order The Steyn gun and Imran Thair at bowling... Imagine if South Africa had this total feature together in 2019 world cup... Winning is secondary but how hard it is to the other teams

Warner played for century not for team. No players celebrate like this when team undr pressure.

<a href="">

Centuries by Warner &amp; du plessis. Nice

Carey missed his century most underrated batsman

WHERE IS FAF DU PLESSES WICKET IN THE HIGHLIGHTS??
Imram Tahir runing like a cow

for some reason australia beat teams like eng and nz but they struggle against sa i noticed in the past couple of years

Yaar who did not like over celebration of Tahir 1 wicket leta hai aur aaisa daaidta hai jaise worldcup kiya diya

AUSTRILLI IS BEST IN THE WORLD HE ALSO BEATS AND CLEAN SCOOP INDIA IS NO 1 THEN SOUTH AFRICA IS BABAIES  STEVEN SMITH IS YOU

Faf is just underrated

Is every South African player a superhuman ? 

Should Africa,  newzland take trophy

Why most of South african players play with GM bats

Yes we won the game

We

Van Dre dussen he is blood in his chest

I think Khwaja got out vs India in a similar fashion against Bumrah <a href="">5:23</a>...

World best player is barber like if you agree

Great Match

2 :22

Imran Tahir is the fastest runner

Van der dussen is the future of south africa and Alex Carey is an underrated player but it&#39;s true that he is one of the best wicket keeper batsman in present

95% viewers are indian

This worldcup was full of suspenseEvery team was beatenSuspense till last over

Faf showed in this match who he is.

Iam so happy that faf plays for csk

I love to south sfrica &quot;(FaF Du Plesis)&quot;

who is best wicket keeper de kock likecarey comment

India is cobra - NZ is mangoose SA is  - Aus is deer

Sad moment at end of south Africa batting because van der DUSSEN DID NOT complete his century but faf made his 12 century

Feel sad For SA and Specially for my FAVOURITE FAF DU PLESSIS THEIR CONSISTENT AND BEST PERFORMER

Imran tahir after taking wicket: let&#39;s got world tour

Biggest fan of south africa teamThey are a good team but have bad luck

South Africa performed really well in Odis till worldcup but they slipped there but still faf and ran vanderdussen and Imran tahir performed really well

My team wons. I love south africa

I think it&#39;s fair to say that quinton de kock is the best active wicket keeper out there nowEdit maybe butler can rival him

SA cant win under pressure. When they know they have nothing to lose then they start winning but cant win when it matters. Bitter but true.

We will three best players of south africa jp duminy ,hashim amla and i&#39;m ran tahir

Wow

Australia beaten with two teams 1.India2.south africa

<a href="">4:41</a>

I think the wicket keeping of Quinton was very good

Phenomenal catch on <a href="">4:03</a>

Amazing
Sa  cricket team have huge talent always but never have luck.

South africa team is always lion

Why de Kock is not wearing pads while keeping

Great win by south africa and my fav player faf du plessis completes his 100!

I really wish that Rassie van der Dussen could have hit a six for 101*

If AB de Villiers was in this world cup, South Africa could have reached the semi-finals.

I like Aiden markram..he is beautiful classy batsman...️️️
Please upload the 2015 World Cup  matches sir time is minimum 15 minutes

<a href="">1:09</a> If Van Der Dussen hadn&#39;t wasted so many balls he might have completed his 100

Africa played superbly in the game but I very disappointed to their poor performance throughout the event.

Bhot. Acch. Laga  soth . africa. Ka. Match

This the south africa we know, and we are looking forward to in the future.

De kock  has also  done a great fifty.He&#39;s so much underrated52 runs,51 ballNot bad

Faf du plasis
Australia has lost its hand .

That was a doni style stumping

How Is Here In 2020 After The Excellent Chase Done By Australia Against England In The Same Venue Where They Lost Against South Africa In Last Year

Hmmm south africa has imoved their game

South Africa also ends in proud way in ICC tournaments but won any world tournaments. 

What a wicket keeping by de cock

I guess it was the last time SA played WC, since they will be able to play no more cricket aimed the dissolution of their cricket board by ICC due to SA government interference.

<a href="">3:38</a> that run-out ️️
Who love cricket

For criket lover <a href="">
Upload highlight for ipl 2020 also

Abhi Facebook and

I like south Africa after Indian team

De cock had the best wk in this series

South Africa be like us to dub Sanam tumhe bhi le dubenge
Fake du Plessis's best innings
<a href=""> MUST watch - - Pakistan vs England 2001 natwest series thriller match at Lords

Very good runs south africa

<a href="">4:19</a> I think if he would&#39;ve ran and dived, he would&#39;ve saved that boundary.

Grant Elloit, Kevin Pietresen , Jason Roy, Sir Andrew Strauss , Jonathan Trott, Colin Munro,Tom Curran These are all south africa players these are all in South Africa Team Means Defenetley South Africa Won World cup Before 2019 World Cup

I wish they had done better in the World Cup. Hopefully they show themselves as a better team whenever the T20 World Cup comes

Why not faf wicket showing

Waovdr

A wonderful win by south africa Iam very sad that vander dussen didn&#39;t complete his century 
There are 6.5 k dislikes from Australians

<a href="">03:07</a>Very similar fashion to how Bhuvi got him out , his technique gets exposed for this type of delivery

If and was there south Africa would go to semis

I thinks that in ipl 2020 in UAE Imran tahir go to Abu Dhabi from Dubai

South Africa is very bad team because they have been defeat against Australia then India have to face Australia in semi finals and England have to have new Zealand in semi finals

Always South Africa 🇿🇦 loves to beat Australia 🇦🇺!!!!  Actually this rivalry started after 1999 wc semi final.

Alex Carey Is find of Australia

Wonderful hundred for David warner

I very well remember I was watching this match at midnight when everyone in my home was asleep I was watching it just make sure Aussies lose this game as india will proceed to 1 rank and all of a sudden my father woke up and sat besides me to see the match and literally we both were so pumped up as it was pp3 and Carey was remarkably showing some great batting display and also hopes of taking Australia over the line but as Morris took his wicket I was relieved but the shot of Lyon really made anxious af bcoz if it would have gone for a boundary Aussies still had a chance of winning it but finally it ended the match as markram took the catch and the Men in Blue proceeded to the top of the table

You can be a muslim



Sharpen?
Very nice  performance   South Africa

<a href=""> check
I wish that This match won by Aus after the result of Semis.May be Aus at top n Semis: Aus&amp;NZ  &amp;  IND&amp;ENGMay IND prepared well!!!!!!Hope so..

South africa is a legendary cricket team

If cricket enthusiast, then a must watch....<a href="">

South Africa is finished in thillering great.

SA is a best team

<a href="">

<a href="">5:24</a>

Revenge taken by South Africa of 1999 WC

Nice vid

If amala or Abe De divillers in sour Africa is the strongest team in the world

Mitchell starc...the best bowler

South Africa&#39;s fielding was outstanding !?! 

South Africa best fielder

De cocks run out though

It&#39;s a great match whenever there is SA vs Australia it&#39;s always be a great match to watch and talking about vd Dussen he&#39;s the next SA hero he had some skills

Nice

Brilian catch teiquen by Q diecuke

i love the stoinies out its superb

Had South Africa played the tournament the way they played in this match, they could have won the tournament. Isn&#39;t it ?

If you want to win then India will win the World Cup.
Leaving now and I will call you in the morning and let and see if

this match made us no. 1 and we had to face nz how awkward is thissame ground 325 and 315 scored2 days later even 240 is too much difficult

I have a notice on du plessis he his hiting centurie in icc but he is not hiting in ipl no centuries

mitchell starc nice bowling

<b>Two teams good batting</b>

There is some kind of curse over the South Africa cricket . May be they are under Heavenly God&#39;s judgment for th discrimination against the Black . .

Guys Don&#39;t You All Think Though Australia Is a Toughest Team But They Didn&#39;t Played Any Match Seriously

South afruca khalna pa ay to bari bari team ki baja da

Van der dussen just missed his century
Alex Carey miles ahead of big &quot;flop&quot; show Maxwell.

Lol, SA trashed the so called best bowling attack! Mauled !

I am very sad that van der dussen not make his century But I am missing my favorite cricketer 360 batsman Ab Deviliers in 2019 CW Missing so much ab deviliers and SA also missing ab deviliers but he was retired in 2019 CW before missing ab deviliers and missing Dale steyn also and SA also missing Dale steyn

I miss world cup it was so thrilling waiting for the next one

Khaweja:Im in pain warnerWarner:Ok Let me call themKhaweja:Ok byeWarner:They got rid Of my Friend i love toGet revengeDavid warner:Hits 122Morris:Just wait HereMorris:SEE MY CATCHWARNER:WHHY!!!

Australia lol

ABD is the best batman of sa

That&#39;s very very super fast century I like Sun TV

Had Australia won this match , I m pretty sure they would certainly made it to the finals And probably India would also have defeated eng in semis bcz bcz eng was only side which defeated India earlier , this time India would have managed 🇮🇳🇮🇳And probably we would got to see Ind Vs auss final and we would have won it 🇮🇳🇮🇳But this match result changed everything but it was a wonderful final and heartbreaking  ( NZ ))

<a href="">1:21</a> What a stance 

Kock is turning out to be a brilliant Keeper.

Who is watching cricket during lockdown

<a href="">4:41</a>= OMG HOW DID HE CATCH THAT

Du plesis was sa to victory

Cannot  remember  a  match  where  sa  lost  to  aus

SA missed De Villiers badly at the 2019 WC.Edit: Thanks for 1.1k likes!

Goodbye duminy,Tahir and Hashim Amla

I don&#39;t like the celebration of warner.Worst celebration

When Australia loses from South Africa ( memorable matches)Australia- 434/4 South Africa- 438/92. Australia - 370South Africa 3713.South Africa- 325/8Australia- 315/10 these 3 matches broken my heart

Fafulous Class.

Imran Tahir wicket lene k baad nanga naach karta h
I am very sad carey can&#39;t  complete  century

Bowled him .(Commentary is )  <a href="">2:26</a>

South Africa wins match

Australia has lost many times to South Africa...Recently in 2020, only two series have been lost to South Africa...South Africa has defeated no one but Australia has defeated them...like NZ has defeated India...
Even after making 325, they won by just 10 runs, what team is South Africa?
Warner tried much , but could not take his team to victory....

SA V AUS is always nail biting

Dhoni who?Watch de cock keeping in this match

south africa team is mangoose and australia team is cobra

They should have payed the whole world cup this way

I love my Indian team

One man can change history-ABD
Steve Smith

Sorry for dussain

This was actually a big gift to India presented by South Africa.But Kohli still messed it up in the semi finals 

I will always remember that <a href="">2:55</a> &#39; The Tahir Run &#39;

ICC uploads worst highlights

I am from South Africa

I miss Hasim Amla

Who else is fed up with Tahir&#39;s celebration?

Why do we always fucking lose against SA

Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand didn’t win the cup but left with their heads held high and left on a winning note.

The way Van der dussen hitting six ...am just said Ufffs

SA FIELDING WOW

Wrong team selection for Australia.....another all rounder should have been there

Well done  RSA
<a href="">3:40</a> Dhoni Cameo 
When Australia team thinking we the best in the world .that time SA team said hold my beer

Sa is a greatest enemy to aus

Very good match David hit century but he is not able to win Australia and faf 100 but last ball van der dussen hit six but there was a fielder

I love Mr 360

I wished abd was here 

What an inning? Really thrilling.

Once Spain will be hosting cricket world cup South Africa will win it

We want SA back as it was earlier..

If Abd played , then match result will also win for SA but plus runs

Hi

SA Showed how african lions roars

Who should imran tahir pack?
Australia need 326 from 300 balls

Nice cover drive from du plesses
Every time lost the show

Every time lost the show

Poor south africa

south africa is such a good team, so sad that they havent won a world cup yet

Remember 2015 world cup.... SA best team 2015 world cup
Is

Can we all appreciate David Warner and Alexander Carey? They both played so well even though their team wickets fall down so easily.

Even though I was supporting Australia, I felt upset for Van Der Dussen he had been playing so nicely he deserved a century.
