This is the best workout I found here in youtube. I managed to finish Bipasha&#39;s Dance workout everyday for 2 consecutive times  so I can burn more calories and do 1 hr workout daily. today is the first time I tried this cardio workout of her, and I can&#39;t believe that I almost faint in 20 mins. I stopped and I can&#39;t force myself to finish it. I&#39;m sweating all over my body and my heartbeat is pumping like crazy even while resting and typing this now. I&#39;m so excited with this and I will make sure that I can finish the whole routine the next time. but I will give my self few tries, do not force yourself if you will try this one it&#39;s really intense.

I lost 8 kgs in two months by doing this and dieting...I have been doing it for 2 months without fail as part of the 75 hard challenge. It helped me lose weight and get into shape as I put on so much weight during pregnancy. Tried so many things and finally ended up here. Feel great and more confident now. Don&#39;t worry if you couldn&#39;t do it in one stretch. Just keep going. Consistency is the key. Trust me! You WILL see the results!!!

I started doing this workout when i was in 9th std  i was not overweight but because of my height i used to look fat I lost weight and my height was also greatI did this perticular workout for 3 years and felt really good my body and myselfAnd the confidence, the positive attitude is just so great Now i have started doing this again This comment is just to motivate you guys and feel good about yourself❤&amp; Yes , You can do this:)

I am 190 I always been 145 my whole life at one point lower than that I&#39;ve gained over 50 lbs in the last 4 years and now that I am engaged I am wanting more to be healthy again. <a href=""> I am not fat but I am thick and have muscle. I am very close to how you were but a lil smaller but I am so sick people making comments to me like I&#39;m huge or like you said having shorts that used to be so cute on me and now I can&#39;t even find a pair to fit me. I used to love shopping now I don&#39;t even want to go to the store and if I do I pick the biggest size don&#39;t even try it on and deal with it. I went from size 5 to size idk because I don&#39;t even want to know the real number. I hate looking at pics of myself now or me before. thank you for your video it&#39;s time to make a change.

One of the best workouts. Super effective. Thank you so much for this session ❤

It is such a great workout that you don't need to go to the gym, you don't need to go to the gym, you just need to spend 30 minutes a day.

i love this so much

Yesterday I workout till 10 mins and today 15 mins🤟 i will not stop doing it till I&#39;ll get my weight 10kgs down and more🤟

Amazing work out for weight loss

✅✅✅✅

I have completed the workout with no problem. I could easily be part of them, I followed them effortlessly. Those less than 30min passed fast, next time I ll do one more round.I think cardio was missed in my workout routine. I do strength training, but somehow over the time I have omitted cardio altogether, and most likely that was the reason I couldn&#39;t get ride of remaining body fat. Hopefully this will do the job, especially because I loved the routine! Hiit cardio is too intense for me, this aerobic style is my more of my cardio type

I wil back after 1 month with result from today ❤

Ith dance
Is this workout strengthen the body ?

I definitely today complete...

I started...my target is 70 kg ...bt today my weight is 100kg....God will help me💪 Thank you bibasha..

Just woooow😍

Is this really effective

I used to love this routine... It is a good one!  Soon I started to lose fat from My lower back!! Besides other benefits....

I started the workout from yesterday ✌I did only for 7 minutes....but today I&#39;ve done for 16.26 mins...o god....i can feel the pain...but i know I&#39;ve burnt some calories....so guys do it regularly....today is my 2nd day...will see...what will happen...

Super super super
Very effective workout ❤

i start 31.10.2022

I am doing this for a week with non oily low carb 1200 calories diet. Not strictly following but counting my calories. I took a day rest. And trust me guys I have lost 2.5 kgs. If you can&#39;t do on first day at least manage to do first 19 minutes and second day you will be able to do it. Just this 29 minutes routine and I am amazed. Everyone should try this. Take lots of water during the day and don&#39;t drink too much water on water break during exercise it will help immensely.

This one is one of the most trusted video. I recommend this to all who are trying to loose weight or are in the process ❤

Very good workout🌹ningal cheyyunnatha kandal thanne    cheyyan thonum 👍

Yesterday  i started this workout. Could only do warm up but it madr me really sweaty.  Rn its day two and 15 mins before i couldn&#39;t anymore

Damn only warm up and I&#39;m sweating rivers

Just resumed this after 4 long years, I had to take 1 min break after every 6-7 min to catch up with my breath. Drenched in my sweat in the end, all worth it!

Amazing👍 thanks🙏
I&#39;m gonna start doing this😁❤.....anyways she&#39;s so pretty❤❤
I could hardly comply till 12 minutes. And I was sweating profusely.

I lost my 2 kg weight in only 20 days with this i walked 1 hour in evening and I followed a healthy diet ..this is great go for it 🧚❤️

Me listening to <b>that that</b> while doing stretching

Love this I haveDoing this on and off whenever I need a good sweat with other workouts always a fav!! I wish she could do more then 2

Let me srt today😋

Wow I don&#39;t know what to say

Honestly as a person who loves to exercise but lazy at the same time ,this workout was not as hard as I expected it to be and I can feel that it will actually work (cause I sweated a lot ,normally I don&#39;t sweat that much with my other workouts)I actually enjoyed it since it didn&#39;t make me feel pressured and I didn&#39;t have to set a timerNormally when I exercise I set timer which leads to me thinking &quot;when will it freaking end&quot; but in this one there is no timer its only her telling when to start again and moreover with only one break and a lot of breathers I don&#39;t feel lazy (Once I keep a gap or break between every exercise I tend to stop it there and not go all the way through) Thanks for this vdo I feel like it will help me a lot....I am actually greatful for this one cause this must be the first time I actually enjoyed any workout 😺

Visually it looks doable now physically that&#39;s another story.Let&#39;s give it a try slowly slowy

Bipasha you are the best

Finally....after 10 days i complet this ex 😊😊.
Wow, what a wonderful class 😍
2022 🙈

Are you feeling bad within 10 minutes or are your eyes happy?
Is there anyone who reduced weight only with the help of this excercise without going into a diet??

And Side to side is my favourite part 😎😎😎😎😎😎

Marching is my favourite part 😀😀😀😀😀😀

my crotch would stick out if i wore those sexy leggings

Trying my best.✊. I think it really hurts when you are doing it for the first time😩

i love you ,beauty

This exercise is very tough to perform with 96 kg. Yet i started to do it regularly with restrictions on outside food or beverage. Wish me best luck guys.

Father 😝😝😝🌹
The thing is if you are doing it for the first time then you don&#39;t need to push yourself so hard...Take small breaks between the sets if you need to &lt;3

Wow I did this when I was like 14, it didn&#39;t do much because I was eating trash. Now i&#39;m (19)in a fitness journey and tomorrow I will do this to bring back memories😂

6 years ago when I weighed 55kg I was familiar with this exercise but I could never complete even one round. Just getting half a turn felt like I was almost dead. Now my BB is 58 but I've been doing weight training a lot and for the first time I can complete one lap. I feel so amazing.
nice

super love u
Day 1 - able to do 15minDay 2- complete set

This is a killer workout! It feels amazing after you complete it.If you are unable to complete it in one go, just do it till the water break and then do the stretching which is there at the end until you feel you can do more. After that do the workout till the water break and take a 10 minute break, then do the rest until you get comfortable with it. And one day you will be able to do the complete routine at once. Don’t be hard on yourself, this work out is a really hard one and certainly not for beginners.

Day. 1 : done in <a href="">6:25</a> minutes

Yes this is extremely tiring...if you do it perfectly you can see results fast...

Superb thank you ❤️

Hi, what happens to our weight if we stop doing this workout suddenly after some days??

Never loved marching this much.. 😂

Day 1 = 10 min only Day 2 = 15min 55 sec Day 3 = 17 min 24 sec Day 4 = 18 min 54 sec Day 5 = 22 min 33 secDay 6 = 30 min Day 7 = 30 min with correct posture 😁 ND I lost 1 kg happy to see results ...it&#39;s really worth it...improvement every day I will give u information ND progress of my weight loss Journey 📉

Good 😄 thnx
If you use some light dumbbells with some of the exercises the routine is even better
This is the best exercise I’ve done so far with visible changes EVERYDAY ! it covers everything . My legs hurt like crazy in Day 1 with cramps all over .. but then that subsided and now I feel great after doing this..

I did it for 21 days, and lost 4 kgs, with controlled diet.

Knee high lateral jumps is my favorite part

Bipasha mam give us 1 min brake bit we get 3 brakes because of the two ads coming between the video 🤣🤣🤣

Great

This is one of the  best workout on internet.I wish they could have come out with more such fitness gems

It&#39;s super i did I I get result in 30 min I lose 1 kg
Started yesterday and I feel stretched a lottt so I decided to keep an update of this.. Day 2-easier than yesterday (obviously no changes)Day 3- felt easier than before (could do the round kicks even more higher) :))Day 4- ✅

Too much helpful. Thank u.

I was on the part doing squat the round kick, had cramps near buttocks I had to stop. I wanted to finish this routine though I think I might just settle on the easier workout, the other workout which is the aerobic dance

How much calorie burns due to this workout ?

O God, I have been doing this for 4 days now and I am still suffering 😭😭 plz help me.
Really amazing😍😓😫

Holy crap it took me 30mins to reach the <a href="">10:39</a> mark ! I wasn&#39;t just breathing I was gasping for breath... 😂😭

I hate this exercise 😠😠😠😑😤😥😧😢😢I lost my confidence
Superb , I love it

I SURVIVED😩
How much calories you burn with this workout? Anyone got idea?

I&#39;d recommend doing this to all the beginners. I lost 75 lbs by doing her workout (20 days a month, I did not do exercise during my period time) and by following the keto diet. It took me 8 months to lose the weight. I started in October 2020. Even though it&#39;s 30 minutes video, for the first 3 months I was taking longer breaks to finish all the workouts and I almost gave up. But I followed the routine. It took me about 2 hours to finish working out at the beginning. But eventually, I got used to it and it took me less time to finish the workouts. By the end of my 8 months journey (May 2021), I was able to finish the workouts without even taking short breaks. I will be working out again to lose 30 lbs more. Just so that, I can reach the ultimate goal of my weight loss journey. So, yeah good luck to all of you who are trying to lose weight!!!

Fantastic ☝🏻👌👌👌👌👌👌👌

How many calories does this exercise burn?

Excellent video, the best by far, but change the thumbnail that does not attract attention
The only time you thank YouTube for adds😂😂😂

bro the warm up is harder than the actual workout itself!!!!

I&#39;m here resting just after 5mins 😁and I want to lose weight 😅😅I&#39;m not reaching anywhere with my lazy attitude 😅

I recommend this workout for those who are suffering high blood sugar and high cholesterol.i am diabetic and i have cholesterol as well.since i started this workout my blood sugar level is becoming normal or sometimes it below normal.if we will continue this workout concentrate in the blood sugar level.the sugar will go down and there is a chance to collapse

Woooooh... Very good... Thank you so so much... Today I did... Full I burned so many calories 👍💪💪👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️😌😌👍👍💪💪👏👏👏👏👏💞💞💞💞💞😘

Very nice and good dear 🤗🙏

Did 15 min proud of myself

This is incomplete information and dangerous to obese people because by doing only cardio you can loose your weight but skin will hang ( check side effects of only cardio in weight loose process) second weight lift is more important and protein intake as per your weight is mandatory.otherwise you will face side effects.all the best.

Finally ,I have completed

I couldn&#39;t finish this workout yet. I am trying it years before 😢😢

Nice

Heyy!!  Guyss!!  Maybe you all be not knowing but whoever is completing this workout. Congrats 😘.Becoz U have done 155 squats in this workout

Thanks Bipasha mam it such a wonderful 👍👍👍❤️❤️ It help me to burn my belly fat ❤️❤️🙏
Hi everyone... I&#39;m doing this workout for around 15days and I&#39;m losing my weight. I suggest everyone that don&#39;t try to do the exercise in one go at one day...instead do the entire set of 30mins slowly but you can take the break or rest if you are beginners... later after one week you can do the complete set whenever its break time in the video.

After a workout .😣😩 paining like a hell 😖
It&#39;s really works. I feel the change

How much calories burn in this video

It&#39;s really good 🤗

Mai to yaha English sikhne aee hun😛

and which exercise
I am very fat, what should I do?
in the rotune my fav part is ... water break and march  and side by side :P ... i hate the rest

This is a simple but powerful routine that you will sweat good and will not regret to try it as I do too. It will toned your body. And feel you confident. Just be optimistic and determine with mental discipline when you promise yourself that you will do it and make a change your lifestyle to live health and stay beautiful inside out because you believed in yourself and be proud with your accomplishment from a tiny steps. Once your body can get to the routine you set yourself everyday, you will amaze that your body will teach and push you to get up to get to your groove in this body workout. I use two videos for two weeks now. I feel like a superwoman and sexy  lol lol in my age at 57 years old. Take care everyone. Have a happy day, go go go!

Advice from my side is if you doing this for the first time don&#39;t try to complete the whole workout  instead do every exercise only once rather than repeating it twice as done in the video but you have to do it till the end( till cool down) because it is very important to cool down your body. then after some days you will gain strength and will be able to do the whole 30 minute workout.

This routine is the best cardio in youtube 🌋🌠🔥🔥🌪️🚀

Way more challenging than the break free aerobic dance... but worth it!!

Best workout i ever found .. seriously too effective if u do it regularly i lost almost 1.5 kg in a week but only problem is i stopped after a week 😐 but if u seriously want to loose weight w/o gym this is the best option
