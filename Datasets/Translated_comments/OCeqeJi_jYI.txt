Bro last ka part achha tha you are right

<a href="">4:10</a> here in 2024 after jadoo and simran ki engagement

The last scene was mind-blowing and true to the current education pattern 

Ashi bhai this AP has given the correct details. Nice  videos of engineering walk on you.
Story of mechanical engineer 

It&#39;s been 4 years and still we are seeing this masterpiece

Maja nahi aya Ashish bhai
Ashu bhai, think about the name of the child, you will be blessed with magic.
Kya ashu bhau 4 saal purani video dekhni pad rhi h
Bhai Jo aapne apne education system ke bare me bola hai na sachme dill ko chuu gaya

Still valid today

Amazing monologue by Ashish Bhai well done

Best relatable monologue on YouTube

<a href="">5:27</a> ️
I like this video 

Ashish has suffered lot 

<a href="">3:52</a> Jado jado ke hai
All the sons of Randi, TEACHER, PROFESSOR, everyone should understand, all the marchers are playing with life only for MONEY, pray that such people die soon.
The ending is reality i am feeling it now 

Not engineering but all education system

<a href="">2:51</a> whaiattt log
Video  Reality  
That's right brother, the education system is a drain on the top, intelligent students have no value.
Any one in 2024

Wax 
There is a dam there
<a href="">9:15</a> Brother, please show me the reality
<a href="">4:04</a> kya fayda simran to jaadu ka gya

Same bro 
Relatable video yaar
This is what happens in our place.
The ending was reality 

Yoyo

<a href="">7:05</a> he said &quot;i want this money&quot; instead of &quot;i want this job&quot; 

The end..... Express the feelings of all the students.. That&#39;s the reality of schools colleges and Institute Really the students have so many pressure on them .... And teachers only see that we are not competing there homeworks asingments Or projects they really don&#39;t know that we learning max 10 subjects and daily we get homework of each subject  .... If they can teach only one subject then how we can learn 9 to ten subjects daily Those who are agree with this comment and ashish bhaiya

the last scene was too relatable

Bro that Id part was sooo relatable I cannot 

<a href="">12:33</a> Brother saint ho jaoo 
2024

This is the voice of millions of Students  being a average student it hurts a lot when u try ur level best but the teachers taunt u instead of appreciating ur efforts. Due to this many students are suffering from anxiety and some are having sucidial thoughts. We badly want our Indian Education System to change. Here they only brainwash us that more marks = more intelligence.

 heart touch video last scene

I love last 5 minute video on education system

Beautiful content

Brother, I am also a student, the last Bala part hit my heart

Legend Watching In 2024 

Sahi bat hai brotherhamari education system sabse vahyat hai



Tears on my eyesso much worrying about carrier and family..

Practical knowledge=0 Truly said 

The most Epic part of the video starts from <a href="">2:08</a> 

The last one became much more relatable.
Legend watching after 5 years

Brother, I am the last one to talk 
2024

Ye to mere college ki baat kar rha h

When I saw you 4 years ago, I still couldn't understand anything. When I went to college, did I understand the whole thing?
The pain of every students No one can understand this without students 

Last Ka Student Of The Year Ka Speech Aaj Bohot Relatetable Lagta Hai

Soooooooo good 

Finally after coming to college after 4 yrs this video is so relatable as an engineering student.

i understand the videojai hind

What will you do Aashis bhaiya...if you make a video today...old video is ready to be seen....you are the Amir Khan of YouTube..that's why I made a video in the last 1 year.
Ending best of all

Brother has come back after watching the story on Instagram and watching the video.
Bhai when did the new video come? Old video when did you see it bro?
What benefit did Simran get from this magic?
<a href="">3:56</a>  cut gaya ashish ka

<a href="">8:32</a> thats reality

Watching from 2024

Watching from 2024

Indian Education System
<a href="">

Bat to sahi hai bhai

Bhi you can express all the students life

PTA never celebrated in our country when this very serious matter was presented only on comedy platform because it was impossible to take pure action.
The lesson behind this is absolutely overwhelming for students like us. The ones who care deserves success but the ones who suffers deserves a salute because even after facing drawbacks they keep running no matter how much the wound of teacher&#39;s, parents and world&#39;s taunt for not being better or as so called smart and intelligent like others pains

Im still watching Ashish vdo in 2024 ️️
This is how a student's life is.
Reality of your dailog

<a href="">1:20</a> 

I just cried at the end 

the pain of boys

My favourite dialogue jcb ki khudai  woh bhi bulldozer 

I cried brother in the last breath.
My condition has also become like this after writing
Ashu be like :mene toh bachha ka nam select kor leya

Asish wasn&#39;t acting in the last part

4 years ago when I was at school I was laughing at this video, today I am at college, I am crying to this video

Last scene was relatable to every of any class or college...

Your student monologue reminded me of Kartik Aryan's PKP monologue.
Brother, in the last part I have told the absolute truth, this is what happens with everyone
FUN FACT:-&quot; This isn&#39;t your first time watching this video&quot;

Video, that's also true but what difference does it make?

You really need a Oscar for last part I can totally relate as humanities stream student we also got project and the pages nd content are so much vast how to cover in that file after writing I don’t remember single word what I have done in the file

This is the reality .Jab sunday ki chutti hoti ha tu physics ki teacher itna kam de deti ha or test me choti se mistake per kehti ha pora din tha kya kya jase ham ne baqi 8 subject ka to parhna hi nhi tha . Tum to bs physics karvati ho hamne to 9 subjects parhne ha .Samjhati ase ha jase koi news par rha ho kuch smajh nhi ata jo likha hota ha vo parh ke suna deti ha are yar itna to ham ghar me bhi dekh ke parh le ge agar ase parhna hota to school kyu ate sach me zaleel kya hova ha .  Really this is the video in which someone tell the reality of Schools and Students .

According to me Simashish must have come to this world 

<a href="">www.youtube.com/@ballteam-gj7sy</a>
100%Right

Besically i had watched the video before but now I am watching again the only diffrence is now I am at college and this thing is now hurting a lot. You travel 30km only for attandance because not a single teacher knows fuck about teaching, but the lecture gets cancelled and you now have to travel again with only disappointment and anger.

I love this video  very nice Ashish I am proud of you

Brother, this is what happens in India, now I am in 9th and eleventh class, I have come to give lectures and I am only writing. In school, fees are charged for practical subjects like chemistry, physics, biology, computer. But he never does his practicals, he just makes notes and talks. Sometimes he feels like he is in 9th, what will happen next?

Hello Bhai, I have joined this school, I am currently studying in 4th class, the name of the school is sunrise international school.
<a href="">4:15</a> good

Last seen was not a joke . It is serious. 

All people see is us just playing and doing nothing they don’t see the reality of the amount of stress we have nothing can overtake the stress on students 

It&#39;s harsh reality  of education system not only in India but in mine Country Pakistan too. Where only Grades matter to institutes and parents as well. It dose not matter what is your Practical knowledge

Vah brother bahut he Maja aaya All the best brother 
3 idiot 
He can understand us

All YouTubers can change milke India education
Feel this

<a href="">11:20</a> hats off 

Relatable

Last wali line dil par lagi.I relate this line.
<a href="">2:43</a>

Really Ashish Bhai, you have spoken the truth. Practical knowledge is not there at all, they run a business in the name of engineering colleges by charging lakhs of rupees.
its true

At the end, sir you spoke the utter truth. A truth that everyone knows, but it remains unspoken. What an irony, where our education system asks for us to be vocal, it self suppresses our voice.

Bro at <a href="">11:50</a> whatever u said it&#39;s like so TRUE

@ashishchanchlanivines
Why did he bat?
It&#39;s a reality not joke 

Real bro
Real hai ashish bhai absolutely true
true i want to die

ID card wala ghatna roj hota hai hamara sath  .now I am in college and I can really feel the last part of this video.

Reality of life

Ashish sahi bola yaar , me ravenshaw college, odisha me padhta hoon,ek bar chemistry practical me titration karte samaye. Maine galti se ek burette Tod diya , maine kharid ke bhi Diya us chutiya sir ko sala madorchod practical exam ke samaye jo external teacher aye the unse ye mc teacher meri backchodi karne laga yaar,maine practical exam me sab kuch thik Kiya tha but the examiner cut 5 marks due to my negligence and I was so angry I could just fuck him out after result I got 93 in chemistry which I hadn&#39;t even expected in my dream. And I after that I fully fucked that teacher&#39;s life by getting into AIIMS bhubaneswar

I saw last seen and I cryed

I&#39;ll vome back when i become collage student

Ashish Bhai really great message you give to all people Great bhaiya

It is absolutely true. Realtable 
The last one was so true that my eyes bursted with tears 

<a href="">8:07</a> To <a href="">12:30</a> Was

I Watched this Video 10 Times !Relatable Bro !

Real baat kahi bro
Dill ko xugayi <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/7cIfY5niDOmSkNAP08CA6A4"></a>

Wow!! Thank you so incredibly much for understanding how it feels to be a student. Because our life is, tbh the toughest. People may say it will get harder once u grow up, but the amount of stress and anxiety given by school is the absolute worst. If we don&#39;t submit our work on time, then teachers humiliate us and say that we will never achieve anything in our life, even though they are the ones who are teachers in a random school.

Indian education system kills productivity
Hashtag humane ya aise he hota hai
Hashtag humane ya aise he nota hai

This video is deeply about students every students must watch this

Last reality felt like Kartik Aryans dialogue from &quot;pyaar ka panchnama&quot; But it shows the reality man.

Bhai maroo

The indian education system is so fucked up thay Over 30 students in IITs alone suicide every year. Damn this fucking colleges I am from india and i dont want to live in this hell of an education system so this is an advice to everyone if you dont feel good at a college confront your parents dont be afraid its better to live in happiness than to rot in this ugly education system.

He is holding better acting capacity than today&#39;s nepo kids .. life of students 

<a href="">6:52</a> RCB pr lgana tha paisa
Final line was ture

Magnificent acting by Ashish and this topic is reality.

Rula diyaa yaar  only student can understand her pain
That what top g said



The monologue is best

Whether a student is of Maths or Arts or Science, the student's M.T.L.B is a human being due to stress.
As a MBBS student,I cried by seeing the ending

Truth is, our (student) life is not easy.. sometimes I have to make my phone, download TikTok and make videos.
Very nice video Ashish Sir  ️
Ending is not a jock . They actually played with students future 

Brother, I am not shocked that I am going to college in the morning.
Bitter truth of Indian Educational System

Sach me reality be like ...........................mm

Same meri life 
Absolutely true brother, this is what happened
Full related video bhie

<a href="">12:53</a> this image is reality of every school student/college student

Ambani my lode pe...
Hello
Why do I have tears in my eyes lol? This was supposed to be a funny video, right? 

Hahahah

I have no words 

lets see how many legends are watching in augest 2023

the real story of every students life ending was very sad and Heart Touching

My friend is true. Same thing happens in my college also.
Op

Yes bro it is relatable

Content 
<a href="">11:20</a>
Ek number

the last one was heart touching

Like I&#39;m noticing, everyone here is going through the same frustration...inter college politics is biggest threat to talent...in my college too, when they put the internal and practical marks, students who get passing marks, suddenly their internal marks goes to 95-100% and those who study thoroughly and sincerely, they get less marks and when someone argues then they say that this is based on internal performance, like this is beyond limits, they blackmail if we go against them...like i can&#39;t even explain inter college politics

Who is watching in 2023?
yes last one is correct

<a href="">11:20</a>

This is what happens in real life
Harsh truth 
Ending scene was litetally harsh reality of our gutter Education system .

Brother, I have made a much more relatable video or given the last words of reality to the students.
I started rolling, just finished 2nd semester.
What is the truth my . Our education system is getting worse day by day .
Abdullah:Maths:theorem 10.1 Phy:ch:1 branches of che and introduction to phy

reality entry is 

g**d has worn out but still got less marks
<a href="">2:05</a> <a href="">2:08</a>

Studied computer science after 12th but did not get much benefit for 5 years, those who did college for 1 year charged 2 lakh fees, then applied for the job, those companies do not have the same age and experience, sorry we will not give the job. Brother, then I decided to start a business and took a loan of Rs 5 lakh from my uncle at home. Started the business in December 2020 and the loan of Rs 5 lakh was completed in 7 months. Life setup or marriage is yet to be done till 2022. Ashish bhai, please watch 3 videos on my life story. My thinking is that after 12th, if you have daddy's business, help him in that business. If not, then start your own setup.
i actually started crying at the end...

Who is there in 2023

True
<a href="">0:42</a> track name ???

<a href="">9:00</a> my be say for fun but every word right

Hashish bhi nai nai science liya hu boot hard yaar motivation achha
Brother, what I said last time was absolutely right, the education system of India is very bad, change it, teach people skills that do not provide employment.
Education system----}Education ministry-----}Government of India ???(Jobs for experience ------or experience for jobs) ???We don't even know that we are under Dictatorship. it's over...
Who is this parson...???

op
You touch my heart

Last wale to mere sath roj hota hai

The video from <a href="">8:43</a> hits different 

One dam is right, brother!
i.e. Pakistan's education system is also like this.

<a href="">11:20</a> completely true Even though i am in 8th class i always think that the school lost golden teachers  bcoz the reality is that they dont want that children should understand they want just the children to write notes These type of teachers say that if we don&#39;t right notes eventhough did not understand anything we will remain failure  the last one was very emotional 

Bhai mast thi vedio

Brother, my 11th college is going on this month, my ass is getting fat.
Watching is 63 milion log  but like 3.5 milion and 122k comment

It&#39;s said that student life is the most beautiful part of life... but actually the life of students ( especially good-medicore science students) after 10th is an application made of tension, competition, criticism, Jealousy, stress, depression and sometimes SUICIDE...

This is exactly what happened
Joke+reality= that is ashish chanchani ️

HATS OF TO YOU end wasn’t a joke it was reality

Dark reality

Would sound weird to someone but I really don&#39;t like my college and college life. It was the toughest period of my life. Neither do I miss those folks (i don&#39;t call them friends) with whom I used to sit in classes. I&#39;m happy now and earning enough to eat and survive on my own.

as a science student it&#39;s true....n when someone ask job experience the fire from my heart rise up

The ending we wasn&#39;t a joke it is reality

What is the matter brother?
The best scene is 3 idiots one job interview 

<a href="">10:30</a> was related evry students 

From <a href="">8:08</a> To <a href="">12:29</a> This is what we call &quot; REALITY &quot; ....

I agree this video is full of comedy but the last scene was not, it was the absolute reality of our Indian education system. These bloody Kisika fathers are killed, even if the earth returns, still why do they need 75% attendance. Homework, while writing, the dirty ass is running in my hand, the pen is running, the copy is being consumed, this is the whole time, the project is being done, assignments are being made, the project is being done, the dirty ass is also decorated, what are you writing in your hand, the bird is not talking to anyone. They will check the entire project and give marks on decoration. You also know how much research is required to complete the project but you do not need decoration. You also know how much money it costs you. This burden will still be on your back if you do not get the correct answers in the class then you will have to leave the class. Have you ever said that your light is flickering? Install a new light. Have you ever said that the current is flowing again and again? Bandh ho ja hai hai nahi kuch nahi aur nahi inko kuch farak part hai .par saara kam to hame par karna hai assignments journals projects homework hai jakar tuition coaching class abe saala padhu kab us bachche koi robot thodi hai hai to do so saare kam Despite this, we should not sleep or eat, we should only eat while eating and take rest for some time and then if any parent sees that we are resting then the situation will get worse and they will taunt them. What should I do, what should I do, I will die 
The reality 

Bhai mujhe rona agaya

 I like this video

TRUE 
Hi

It&#39;s a true think

Well said brother, this is the life of a student 
The Last part was soo touching it&#39;s actually true I just finished my 9th finals and will be going to 10th and there is no drawing subject and sports period will be taken by other teachers and I really want to be an animator it feels hard

That's right bro, the letters are written on the hand of the writer.
His last dialogues were justttt awesome real

This video deserves 300 plus million

Well done bro
<a href="">11:20</a>

<a href="">8:48</a> Generally cbse need 75% attendance but in our school need 100% attendance I don&#39;t know what the f**k principal do with 100% attendance

Great ending 
Yes he photo is real life

Endiing wasn&#39;t a joke 

This video is 100% relatable with students life

Absolutely true, the last one was great..Our education system was not like this before, since India has emerged from the sea, we have created such a system 
bhaiya ne actual dil ki bhadas nikal di, felt really happy, our whole system is based n the way that if u try something new and different from others everyone else will pull ur leg in such a way that u won&#39;t be able to stand up ever again, they start to doubt themselves and that&#39;s when they lose half-way, i want to be an engineer myself, not bcz of others but bcz of my own choice and will, what i want to do is far away from what will be taught to me in the process, never really understood the concept of learning organic chem for becoming an engineer but find absolutely no other way other than that, trying something new is way hard than any one can even expect, people focus tend to focus on the one red rose growing between the bunch of white roses and they try their best pluck that flower and murder its existence.

This is boys

And there is so much drama in big schools that the pressure of studies is put on the students. and Students can go into depression due to high pressure. And such a meaningless book is given to read, there is no use of reading it. First of all our family puts so much pressure on us regarding our education. The school pays more attention to our marks than our learning If you get good marks then you or if you don&#39;t  then you are very bad. Our teachers tell our future  seeing our marks.

Hiiiiii

This was shot in my school 

This is called reality

Yaar actually you nailed it  literally loved this video related to every science students 

Tell me about your heart, brother!
The end was not a joke salute to you bro

Well u said the truth bro My life story is also kind of same tho

Students like karo , share Karo , comment kro Or education system wale : thodi si sharam kro  dhandha bna rkha h education ko ajkal jiske fees 2 lakh thi ab sidha 12 lakh kr di ?fees sirf itni honi chaiye Jo bache khud part time krke de sake these days even parents ko loan lekar pdhana pdhta h . Learning ke liye udhar the person who discovered education must be ashamed of the system now !

Very relatable

It seemed as if I was telling you that you are good.
Engineers students understand 

My favourite part was last part

Liking this vdo only becoz of the last part . It is a fact 

brother super video
Being a mbbs student, this video kinda hurts

You said the truth in the end but you don't even give me any feelings and everyone goes to kill you.
