Namastey London deserves Award, what a composition ❤️

Kisi or ka award tumlogoku mil gaya

This log is so fake my friend 🤦🤦🤦
Balls that play the clock get awards. It is necessary to start ringing the bell from now on.
Gully gang for life Hip hop on top

All awards are made by Karachi Pakistanis for their own people like Akhtar Bhatt Kapoor Khan Deepika Paanu
There is nothing bigger than the country, O mother, why do you care about me, why do you have rivers flowing from your eyes, you used to say that I am your moon and the moon is always there. Is there any doubt? We have to think that we will help the country. Where are you taking me?
Alia didn&#39;t deserve. She was the supporting actor in the movie and her part was so short. Unfair totally

lauda ka Filmfare awards hai

I that way even i think that khilji performance by ranveer deserved to be awarded because historical film is anyway tough and when ranveer played sanjay it was a biopic

Coclusion:Bollywood was garbage, is garbage and will always be garbage.

Shahid deserves the best actor who agree 😎😎KABIR SINGH WANAWOON✌️✌️💪💪💪
Himesh please stop wearing that Pathectic wig.....better start wearing cap again

Kangana is the best actress... Alia is nthg in frnt of her.

Himesh has said damm correctly.....Great Words

Award on sale to nepotism

Kangana renaut deserve the best actress award for her movies

Himesh ji, what should I say?
Bollywood acting has become very popular, music and lyrics have also been added... out of 100, only 4 or 5 films have been made, but everything is added..
Those who support Aliya and Ananaya for award they are being brainwashed or brainless.

Wow Himesh Reshmiyan 👏👏👏
Im only sad for Shreya Ghoshal 😍😍😍

I  hate star kid,  stardom  and nepotism, specially  karan johor  and it&#39;s  students.

Nepotism will not be eradicated but Bollywood will occupy the niche, listen to the stars of nepotism now and learn better acting.
Himesh was right. It&#39;s just point of view. If you deserve, you will get your due sooner or later

Taapsee was &#39;preparing&#39; for the award ? For giving constipated expressions in brilliant film ?  Or turning every character into something like her - dilli ki tomboy muhfat ladki

Hrithik Roshan deserved filmfare for super 30

Himesh Reshammiya said well!!!!!
I m A huge fan of arijit singh... But this time teri mitti singer B paraak deserved filmfare...

What are the awards?👎👍The real thing is where the heart feels ❤️❤️
Taapsee kya hot hai yaar
When I feel like a human being, I meet Rani and meet Shahid Kapoor.
film fare gives awards only stragglers😂😂😂😂😂 and oscar give awards without any struggling that&#39;s why joaquin phoenix winns oscar😊😊

Alia Bhatt winning best actress award is shocking

Himesh said it well..🤘

The Kesari song deserves to be found in your soil... its time will come for the bad song...
Apna time aayega what song will he sing or who gave him this award…..who gave him this award….
Best actor - Vicky Kaushal

Teri mitti should have been awarded as the best song.

Even rishi kapoor once said he paid to Filmfare for the award for movie Bobby in his autobiography &quot;khulm khula&quot;.

HIMESH RANDUUU MONDOL KA LOVER🤪🤪🤪
Parasite won 4 oscars (really a great movie)Joaquin phoenix won best actorWhereas Bollywood keeps fukin&#39; with nepotism

Aise award shows fake tv shows h,sponsored shows hote h,sponsor decide krta h kisko dena h,apne fayde k anusar,...organiser ko paise chhapne hote h....inko jyada value dene ki jarurat nhi h,Govinda,amir ,salman ,akshay ,kangana,or john ne apne shabdo me in award shows ki sachchai batayi hui h..Or rhi baat is saal filmfare ki, to sponsor tha amazon or gully boy ka streaming partner v amazon ...Aap chronology samajhiye😂😂

I stopped watching filmfare awards years ago

Award function fake hai

Film awards endorse Nepotism , injustice , partiality.
This is all Modi ji's lack. Whose match was there. We are getting nothing but we are getting nothing and we are getting no use.
Hitesh spoke quite well, its diplomatical and smooth.. 😊👍. In the talent industry, if you have reached the nomination level then it&#39;s TRUE that no one can take away what you have, and achieved. The due shall be paid in time.

Now bollywood is group of jerks.

Whoever su*** Karan johar&#39;s they will get awards, kangana was true, awards will be fixed by Karan johar

What fun these slutty girls now have in showing their breasts Bhosdike
Amaal&#39;s reaction is priceless❤️
Whole bollywood is overrated.

Himesh is very happy. I thought how much such a ball would go to hell.
No one has set the right bc they have to do online voting only to see how many votes they have. Hogye ho bc sb farzi hai bollywood wale
Failmfare is fake

There are fake awards because there is a ninja technique to make everyone happy. Apna time aaega best lyrics? seriously?? ??? never.
Filmfare got scared so much and gave the award to Alia.. if they didn&#39;t give then she would have told&quot;Mere Ko award nahi Mila toh DHOPTUNGI Naa&quot;

That one line people are making fun about, the song doesn&#39;t end their &#39;parvaz dek parvane ki aasman bhi sir utayega &#39; &#39;jitni takat kismat mai nahi utni rahmat mai hai &#39; this lines have deep meaning and other lines also just go and read lyrics.

Sabke apne point of view hai like himesh reshammiya said. Totally agree with him. For me, gully boy was an exceptional movie and I loved it. Admittedly it didn&#39;t deserve 13 awards, proves it to be a set up but the songs and lyrics for every song of that movie touched me deeply, much more than other songs people are talking in comments like bekhayali and teri mitti. These songs were also really good and I liked them a lot but I absolutely loved gully boy doori azaadi and others too.. it&#39;s just about point of view..Apna time ayega became kind of an anthem.. people been making t shirts and mugs and whatnots about it.. it is going to stand the test of time too.. I do not think it was an undeserved award. In the end u have to choose one among many good pieces.

1.56 and 2.10

Indian actor really good actor when giving interview

Himesh spoke truth

Rani mukerji deserves it the most

Alia should return the award

This is how it feels like they have it.

Himesh reshmiya have a good point.. sensible guy

Everyone is double-minded, y log award that they got in a party, where everyone fucks and eats and comes, everyone keeps telling their point, double standard totally. Who care's.🥱😴
Gully boy tatti

I really want south india to be ahead of bollywood .....are we not tired of seeing this kids in limelight always  while talented actors are treated like 2 degree actors

I agree with himesh the songs like gully boi has no significance will never run such songs on any platform.

Taapsee looks like prostitute

Hritik deserved best actor award♥️...Like here
For the 1st time Himesh made sense.

Divine ko pehle se hi pta tha ki usko milne wala hai

Akkkki sir deserves acting or music of your movie too.
Audience Loved Kesari, they give Award To Gully boy, may be this award is for Organiser Choice based.

What does this Himesh Reshmiyan want to say, he is not a fool, he is a crazy man🙄
Don't gift any bra to Urvashi this year???🤣
Aamir was the first person to boycott filmfare awards from 92 when he didn&#39;t got award for well deserve performance in Jo jeeta wohi sikander but that is not a reason he stop it was after that he came to know from inside source that Awards was fixed by the person production  who got best actor award that year by paying of the editor of filmfare during that time.

Bindass girl tapsee panu my fab

Axactly ...Himesh sir is right.

Bollywood trying it&#39;s worst to imitate Hollywood and failing miserably every time.

Alia doesn't deserve that and even the best actor does that, Ranbir doesn't care about filmfare.
Sab chor sale . Meri mintti sab se best song tha

Filmfare faltu hai chutiya hai

Tapsee is reaaly horrible.

Totally agree with himesh👍🏻

Everyone is crazy
Award is for sale
Filmfare awards are all a game of money..real acting is not even oxygenated.
Bakwas award function

Every year there are popular actor and actresses only as the nominees

1990 - Talent was everything not money2020 - Money is everything not talent

What is this...what is this?
Himesh was absolutly correct 👍

Best debut actress should be goes to Ankita Lokhande instead of struggler &quot; Ananya Pandey &quot;.

Paise ka khel hai.... Paisa phek ho aur tamasha dekho.... Making a FILM is a beautiful art... for future generations these films will be worth nothing to learn....

No one has the courage to speak against him.... Your brother will close the shop.
Himesh Reshamiya Has The Best Answer...

himesh chutiya

I also got to eat grapes
Why tapsee is so rude and frustrated soul??!!! She thinks she is very bold and in real she is oversmart and she gets offended every single time. So irritating to see her speaking like that. Really liked the way himesh spoke. That is called humbleness. People are not because of you, you are because of people, don&#39;t forget.

We all are the children of English and we don't understand anything...😆😆😆

Best female playback singer goes to shilpa rao for the song &quot;ghungroo&quot;. Really?????😑😑😑actually the winner is shreya ghoshal and vaishali for the song &quot;ghar more pardesiyan &quot;. Shame on you filmmfare 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Filmfare awards are decided by Dawd Ibrahim.

Why this Bollywood heroines want to show their boobs ?? Their boobs aren’t so seductive. Very small like oranges only .

Ye sab bhi to tatte hi hai

Well said Himesh 👏🏻👏🏻
Himesh put it so eloquently

Himesh and his shitty thoughts :)

Himesh in short : Be positive 😉

My heart is always awarded mile after mile, no difference is made between the hours.
Who is at <a href="">1:06</a>

Himesh is rite

Film fare was completely bogus and stupid gully boy was good but not this much that all award can be won by it....

Nepotism ka nanga naach ☹😡🤬
Himesh and Tapasi should interchange their clothes.......... .

Sholay -1 awardLully boy - 13 awards

Bakwaas Filmfare, super 30 and kabir singh  are eligible for more awards,. Just bcoz all these are produced by Amazon prime and Filmfare sponsored by Amazon given to Gully boy... Sad..

What did Himesh say? Bhai tell me in short.
Best actor-- shahid kapoorBest actress-Kangana ranuatBest film-Super 30/kesari
Mad man, you show the mentality of people by not playing music for the country, the issue is love for the country, you guys are just fooling the public.
Never heard such a pure song than Teri Mitti .. Agr yeh gana deserve nhi krta toh bhai ek baat clear hai.. India me desh bakto se jyada galibhatk hai !!!

Shahid Kapoor should have got Filmfare for best actor... He was fucking best for Kabir Singh.... Shahid Kapoor deserves the award...

Himesh ji answered the question very wisely otherwise one wrong word could&#39;ve caused a very big commotion in the industry and Filmfare would&#39;ve been doomed.

<a href="">1:31</a> pe yh kaun h?

How cleanly are the jhooth bolts sold?
Perfect tha best actor Mai Shahid Kapoor for Kabir Singh Kyun ki woh deserve karta tha

Bakwass award

Who thinks that Teri Mitti should get that award?
They all spread filth.
Bollywood awards: Too much manipulated fixed racket

All the evils that used to exist in the society are being filled in a constitutional manner by creating a democratic system in the country. For the last 70 years, those same holes are being filled by these vulgar, leftist ideological directors, actors like Anubhav Sinha, Taapsee Pannu and countless other names. Together they are busy digging with shovels.
Amaal or Armaan jsa koi nhi both are best 🥰🥰😘😘🤗🤗❤️❤️
I saw Honey Singh in black cap 😲

Best actress, best singer, best comedian, best director Filmfare goes to Alia Bhatt &amp; Ranvir Singh

Acha he ki dhire dhire logo ko filmfair awads ka such pata chal jaega, or eshki value khatam ho jaegi.

Who is the favorite jury of the film unfair?
Himesh said a lot of things
Main dekha filmare award 2020Aisa ​​lag raha tha ke shadi chal rahi hai jaldi mehndi sangeet hosted by chakka sala karan johar
Jab Tak Karan johar hai bollywood me aisa hi hoga
Boycott will not stop these awards
Ye nepotism bahut jaldi Bollywood ko leke dubega , only showoff no talentTamil Cinema takeover Bollywood

Well said Himesh

Best answer given by himesh <a href="">3:30</a>

Gully boy was out of the race for Oscars, that's why the film industry did not give many awards to him
Best chootiya Katwa award goes to Gally Boys.

Himesh Spoke very right..awards dont have validation in long run

Ek tumbbad ke fronte pura bollywood pani bharta h... Chutiya industry

i thought ranbir will receive best actor award total  shit awards

Amaal said true
Best actor should goes to Akshay Kumar for Kesari ,Lekin kya kr sakte hai , corruption sirf politicians hi nhi bollywood me bi hai

Because TRP on YouTube was interrupted, I took Asim Sid first and after the film fair, no one brought any news, I watched the news, I didn't make any bastard, what did my father do to me?

Amaal had a great point
Rap can never impress me even in the next 1000 years ,Teri mitti deserved the best lyrics for sure And gullyboy was a super average movie

Dil jeetna zaruri hai award mile ya na mile..Then yaha lada chusne aya hai at the award function..Come out again..
I understand what Himesh is saying and awards are pointless in the long run but when these awards are blatantly given to someone simply on the basis of pure biasness and nepotism, then it becomes a slap on the face of all those who truly worked hard to get the recognition for it. I feel like not only did these deserving people not get an award, but also did not get any form of recognition for the effort put into their works. They need to change. Period. And until they do, people should stop watching these biased waste of time shows and nobody should attend them either.

&quot;Strong REACTION&quot;

Dance, enjoy, take half the money or flatter them, spend one night under them and take away the award, here brother, there is mud everywhere, the basic thinking of the people here is mud, this country will never change.
80% of Bollywood is dung.
I should do the work of showing my boobs.
Me to My friend about Himmesh :Paisa kat iske overacting ka🤣

Friends, just take a minute to read my comment.. I have not come here to earn money.. If there is any need for money, I keep working but I feel like I am dancing in love with someone else. I have made videos and I am not taking any money. You can do it. I have not monetized it. You have also learned about ads. I have not come here only for love. You can do it. Watch the videos. Malum ho jaya ga I love so much from India.. Jai hind friend's

Looks like it&#39;s a regular practice now to flaunt cleavage even Himesh isn&#39;t shying away lmao

These award functions are so lame... So are the performances.

Himesh is looking very strange
Gandu arman malik
Only Himesh made sense.

No one dares to talk about these shallow paid award shows except for few actors who r all by themselves.... Yeh sab janate hain kuch aisa waisa bol diya toh kahi apna kaam na ruk jaaye kyunki khudke dum pe films main aana is the rarest thing in bollywood... why to be the rare tiger in the jungle and earn ur meal if u can be one of the sheep in the flock and get destined meal everyday...

Best song award=There's nothing like it
all is sold boycott filmfare
Why alia keep winning awards everytime award show happened?

&quot;FO&quot;to Bollywood and nepotism and KJO ...the mother and father of nepotism

These whole milkmaids are driving us crazy...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seems like BOLLYWOOD HEROINES are getting carried away by HOLLYWOOD HEROINES for exposing and funniest part is BOLLYWOOD HEROES are getting carried by BOLLYWOOD HEROINES in showing of CLEAVAGES. Wah bhai wahi . MEN EMPOWERMENT by following WOMEN EMPOWERMENT.  BOLLYWOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Who else think that the awards were biased😑

I tried to keep it in the last hour
Himesh - mujko 6 dikhta Hain to kisi ko 9,  par hame to award dene wale chutiye dikhte hain

Himesh nailed it🔥❤
I never ever thought I&#39;d say this... But, Himesh was logical!

Spit on gully boy thu..thu..

Ananaya also did not want to be found
I still can&#39;t believe that Ananya Pandey won best debut award.I know its too late but i still can&#39;t get over the fact that Aish and Randeep didn&#39;t win best actor award for Sarabjit. That movie is a gem.

<a href="">0:30</a> who is this so ugly
Best move of 2019 is KGF BAAP OF OLL BOLLYWOOD

Mitti song deserves more🙄Indian movie awards suckkkkk
Is bar awards bht bkwaas thy ananya panday deserving nhi usy awars de dia ye award sirf sara ali khan deserving
To be Honest these so called Trophys and awards have somewhere lost it&#39;s importance because of what ever reasons. Every non deserving candidate is getting awarded for no reason. It&#39;s a trend now, just like Shukla got awarded for his arrogance and violence after a 4 month show. Ab toh logo ko aadat ho jaani cahaiye hypocrisy ki!😂

Actually, Himesh is right and has logically proved his point.

Sb khareed rahe h bc

Urvashi Rautela ko koi goli maro, itni aachcha acting karne ke liye in comment to reporters. No knowledge, no sence, hypocrite.

Anita lokhande didn&#39;t even get nominated , and Ananya won the prize for best debut 👏

We love you amaan malik😘😘😘😘😘

Jab tak ye Chakka (meetha johar) rhega bollywood mein tab tak Rajkumar Rao, Ayushmann Shahid Hrithik, Ajay insabko ko wo jagah nhi milega jo wo deserve karte hai.

Flopfare awards sab dekhna band karo flimfare itne ache classic song chod kr jhaatu raps ko award mil rahe

Alia did so many great roles but I don&#39;t think she should have got an award for her role in gully boy hee other roles are pretty good but not this one

Himesh bhai, why are you there my friend, what are you saying?
I don't understand anything about the society, why do Bollywood people make remakes of Tollywood? Or why do the public watch them by remaking old songs too? This means that the public is here, why do you guys make movies for yourself, why do you come to the south, how many good songs can you sing? hai aare kisko south language nahi ati vo bhi sunta hai Orrr tumlog wahi ek song ko remake karke hai kapo hai tumlog. Where is the name of Bollywood, all the movies from Tollywood are becoming world wide famous?
That&#39;s the very reason these Indian awards will never ever be able to find a spot near oscars or golden globe.

Saath milke dekho toh &quot;69&quot; it is visible
I think the award show was organised by Gully boy team 😄

KY yr ye saal Mai bs dhon movies achi thi tanaji or Simba baki sab bakvas thiReal actors in bollywood for this are Akshay Kumar, ranveer Singh &amp; Ajay devgan Orrr koi nahi

Ankita Lokhande actually deserved BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESSAlthough SIDDHANT CHATURVEDI was deservingAbhimanyu Dasani should have been a tie with Vishal JethwaAlthough the jury awards that were given to Ayushmann, Bhumi &amp; Tapsee were really good&amp; Geetika for Soni &amp; Sushant for either chhichhore or Sonachiriya deserved an award&amp; why the f was ananya Pandey given an award🙂

Sister-in-law Tapsi Pannu is comparing her movie with Kabir Singh.
Nepotism At peak🖕🖕
Bollywood walo tollywood walo se kuch sikhoOnly south😎🔥

<a href="">3:41</a> man and woman takes a long run behind him😂😂

Where is Kangana?
Filmfare has sold out
How is this Himesh Reshma talking about so much samajhdari?
Y the media is asking such question, talent is something that matters

Tapsee is love ♥️

Only for  gully awards...  Nt for thumbad

Who is this third guy wearing jacket n white tshirt can anyone please tell me

<a href="">1:54</a> to <a href="">2:08</a> fakeness overloaded

Gully Boy was good movie but not that great to receive 13 awards. 2-3 awards at best it deserved. And sending gully boy to Oscar is pathetic.

Himesh da nee solid bola
Has the path to Filmfare been opened?
Chutiya award show bc

Those fuckers want to meet Mondal🤣🤣🤣
Best actress award to Aaliya for a 15 min role BC MJAAK is going on, oh brother I love you
Filmfare is not landfare award but this is BC
Himesh said it all.

Every single actor is FAKE IN REAL LIFE....they r actors everywhere in front of camera....

Wt d hell band award karo ye tamasha atleast akshay n kangana deserve krte the year for kesari n manikarnika aur bhi log hai jinko milna chahiye tha saale chutiye alia bhatt omg isko mila n wo ananya better than us to tara sutaria thi n sabse badi chutiyapanti main jaha rahoon song aj tk nominate ni hua mtlb hadd ho gai
Tum he ana deserve....bc best song tha yeh

Bollywood has not come out since the last hour because only then Oscar's ass is available.
<a href="">0:27</a> she should&#39;ve been nominated. Such a graceful performance she gave!

Gullyboy&#39;s any rap song could be given award in lyrics but music , there was no music in gullyboy

very well said himesh !

Galat mila actor ho ya music bht galat h
This is what... I think that people are crazy.
Most of the Bollywood movies are copies of some English or South Indian movie. Bollywood movies are expert in stealing movies, some steal movies, some steal music, some steal dance steps and some steal scripts. I haven't even left the photo of the picture, it's all nonsense, it's a game of money and nothing else.
Bollywood award is thrash

Himmesh gave the best answer

I agree with Himesh Reshamiya Saahab.

Boycott filmfare shame filmfare
Gully boy is the most Undeserving movie to get 13 AwardsTumbbad was the most deserving movie which even didn&#39;t got the nominations

Gully boy ko award!! what day is ahead
Boycott FF awards 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Tapshi is the queen of Delhi🤔🤔🤔
Gully boy award Mila Hoga guessing 🤔🤔🤔 paka
Kangana deserves the best actress award but you are a pig... I will get such a terrible award soon..! Don't give it to akki when it comes, don't give it to sir, you are strange in promoting actors.
Why are you wearing clothes? What do you need? You are to be advanced, to be modern, to be free and then to become a human without any clothes, you have to wear it as you are..! Don't know what girls are doing..! Then we should ensure that no one looks at us with evil eyes..? Wah..! No matter how much filth you spread on the screen
Himesh answer was very satisfying and good...😋

Alia bhatt my tits 💩💩💩💩
Chuthia film ko award mila &quot;gully boy&quot; 💩💩💩💩😬😬😬😬
Karan johar fucked the mother of bollywood
Sometimes its all abt how u present/ xpress wat u feel I so beautifully said... <a href="">4:40</a> himesh said it all said the best 👍💯

Devine rap star😎
SAJEDKHAN My time will come
This guy is coming here too, his time is coming.....😄😄😄😄
All awards nominated Kesri and Manikarnika.
Ankita lokhande also deserve award For debut
Nalla impotent Karan Johar inko gobar bhi de toh these sluts will accept...no acting no face no figure no glam

There is a lot of talk about Himesh, I am satisfied with his children.
<a href="">4:12</a> himesh bahi ekdam correct

Urvashi always used to escape..I heard nothing..are you staying in India or somewhere else?
Aliya has no shame to accept the award

Himesh always follows philosophy. Saala jhoota
Sorry but even taapsee doesn&#39;t deserve this one..  Kangana was the best in manikarnika and judgemental hai kya..

Who gave the best debut award to Ananya Pandey..?? sale dog
I think Amitabh and Taapsee also stood a great chance with Badla

The koi lyric is Apnatime ayega ganda ayega
Well said himesh 👍
Himesh Reshamiya's statement seemed the most confusing.
<a href="">4:24</a>  Himesh spoke correctly👍
Himesh Reshammiya part was very logical✔️❤️🌼🌼
Shilpa rao got Best Female Singer, no doubt Ghunghro song was a hit but Ghar More Pardesiya from Sheriya Ghosal was more deserving,

we need kangna at this time... sabki maa behan kr deti akele...

Credit!!!
Alia Bhatt undeserving
Ye sab award show 1dam faaltu he deserving karte he k aawaa har ko hai jata hai
Best playback singer award humein mile but arijit sir aayenge lekar jayenge ऽबी आस लगा कर रक्हेंगे Best playback singer award humein mile but arijit sir aayenge lekar jayenge ऽयेंगे जेंगे जेंगे जेंगे जेंगे ।
Tummbadd is not even nominated...HD hai😥😥
Urvashi Rautela is the most fake person in the world😡Love you Himesh bhai. You may not like his songs but you just can&#39;t hate him❤️

Tumbbad film  get Oscar 120%But they sent gully boy for oscar

This award is too small for Teri Mitti Song.... He gave it as per his means.... Your time will come..... Teri Mitti Song is not the heartbeat of the heart.... ... Uske lyrics sirf padh b lo to aankho me aansoo aa jaye...... Ye bikau log kya award denge
himesh bhai said absolutely right
All comments of stars been positive these kind of questions are stupid and pr made controversy.

Himesh reshmiya said very goid thing... Claps for him...

Alia is good bt she didn&#39;t deserve this award f4 her supporting role in &#39;Gully boy&#39;...it&#39;s all about nepotism... 🌟 kids alws on the frontline

All Madharchod's leftovers are making us happy.
Bekhayali is more deserving then apna time ayega

Dhinchak Pooja should get award 🙏
Teri Mitti Song And Kesari Movie Deserve An Huge Award 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Not Only Film Fare 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Seriously Teri mitti song deservers awards.....

Himesh Gud

Yo urvashi is so dumb... I grew up because my brain didn't grow.
Bosdk ha..... Not good at all....... Like f... K people

Himesh nailed it ..........

Gully boy chuteya movie of the year

Himesh should have eaten food in the election, he should have given a special speech...
Media kya bakwas question puchta hain logo ko heart karka answer lena jaruri hain kya🙄🙄

Himesh looks like a gay. Kusra
Bollywood=🤣💩💩💩💩
Sahi bola himesh ne
Welcome👆 My Channel.
Who lOver TERI MITTI SONG? :)🙏👍🔔
As a feature film entry in oscar nomination &quot;gully boy&quot;was chosen...and I don&#39;t know y it was taken..even now I m confused Filmfare also made it a blast..so disgusting..super 30 is appropriate..there is a social message..biased

Pelpelour award
Manikarnika was a pathetic movie Kangana was cringe!

Yes apna time ayega logon ne famous kiya  but jury&#39;s job isnt to follow the audiences. Then apna time ayega should have been given people&#39;s choice award. Jury&#39;s job is to choose what is best regarding the lyrics and composition. Like youth today indulges in junk but healthy food should always be the winner.

Filmfare worst jury team

Next year to Sohail Khan ko dabang 3 ke liye best actor nominate karane wale hai

Oh god! Who gives the rap the best song award😠...a completely fake award show

Alia get favours because she entered into rumoured relationship with Siddharth Malhotra who is a toy boy of karan johar. She helped him in covering of the relationship 😁...that&#39;s y he became her godfather 🍬

Only National award has always Great. Filmfare award is always Best ever Chutia award.

Best actress debu use mila jo movie flop ho gayi like seriously...

&quot; Teri mitti &quot; gana pure hindusthan ki shaan h, jarurat nhi is gane ko is kali murti ki... Ye gana shaan tha hai Or hmesha rahega...This song deserve more than this.. .. Ananya ko struggle kr k award mila..... Big big big big  joke 😜 😂😛😀😂😀😛😂😀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Award to &quot;&quot; baby beer peeke naache &quot;&quot;wale song ko hi milna cahiye.
Zoya Akhtar's mother......Joker Ranvir Singh and Nautanki Dukan gave the best actor and actress award to Alia. Asai nepotism hota Raha to Bollywood will soon be ruined.
Salman sir knew this decades ago about awards sab bikau awards hai

ghanta award show....

This is Tukde Gang's award show..

Kangana was right
Majority of these baskets are just trying to be diplomatic. The truth everybody knows.

Best Actor: Shahid KapoorBest Movie: TumbadBest Lyrics: Teri Mitti
<a href="">1:59</a> wtf she was about to say truth but she took u turn.

Truly agree with Amal Malik and Himesh Reshammiya

My soil ❤️❤️❤️
If he is associated with any of Karan Johar's films then this award is definitely for sale.
Best actress in comice role yamigautam for bala

Amaal bhaiyu u both brothers are great aap jitni motivation dete ho utni koyi idol nhi deta we all armaalians are always with u and luv u forever

Himesh is looking like osita.

Alia got award for gully boy where her part is of only 10-15 min. Kangana deserved award for Manikarnika in which her acting was amazing.

M not a fan of himesh reshamia but what he said in this was absolutely true.😄

Skin show

Sab chutiye hai sale gully boy vale paid awards..

I don&#39;t understand why Ankita lokhande was asked 😂😂😂😂 the reporters are indeed screw-less.

I won&#39;t watch Bollywood anymore😤

Best lyrics Teri mitti
Bollywood is shit now,not even worth our time, they only make remakes now

Bunch of Hypocrates and Selfish people..... mostly

There is nothing left in this Bollywood and IFFA award, it has been sold...
Boycott nepotistic kids

Ye bollywood wale madrechod hai____sare bakau log hai.....we support South movies 🙏🙏🙏
worst movie of 2018 kalank movie got 6 filmfare awards,is this a jokefare awards

Buy awards... Hindustan's history remains... shame on people for showing off their bones... shame.
This is India my friends, everything is sold here
Bollywood has become mad, it has been sold in dung, it has been washed away.
I liked the opinion and the way Amal Malik talked he nailed it

filmfare kya ab films ko hi avoid kro humare peso pe aesh or humari choice ka dhyan nahi ese bollywood se dur raho or atleast theatre ko avoid kro ghrpe dekho

Why tapasi is looking so ordinary

This is the reasion why Amir Khan don&#39;t  turn up for award functions

Where is Ranu Mandal??Bhai????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Whenever tapsi open her mouth💩

I personally didn&#39;t like guly boy , I don&#39;t know how it became hit

AAP log Varun Dhawan Ko overacting actor keheta hai par usne October jaise masterpiece aur sui dhaaga jaise heart touching movie de pat tabhi ek bhi award nahi Mila best debate actress should goes to bandits Sandhu for October and best actor Varun dhawan

Teri mitti song ko milna chahiye tha...😢😢❤❤🙏🙏
I didn&#39;t even expect that gully boy would win seriously bollywood is degrading now

What time has come, you still buy awards 🙄🙏🤣🤣🤣
<a href="">0:47</a> If you buy it then you will get a lot of milk. He must have told me that he will come and meet you.
Kash kangna se poochte mazaa aata ye nalli actress kya kahi gi

Bakwas song apna time aayega

Hrithik Roshan - I'm Not Afraid (Official Music Video)
Why don&#39;t these event managers organise public polls 1 month before the event? Who are these managers ro decide what public likes most.

These people are so afraid of movie mafia karan johar.

Maa chudwao bollywood award waalo.
Filmfare has always been biased..why all the halla now? They always give awards to rich families Bachans,Khans Kapoors.Nothing new just watch the award function for the dance performances 😂😂Vicky won a National Award but dint even get a critics award in Filmfare.. Funny!!

Chutiyo se bhra h bollywood
I did not get an award in Filmfare, this is the same people who give awards to someone from Dance India, Indian Idol and they comment here.
Filmy  Fake awards 👋👋👋🤣
Sb bolna chahtey hai pr drtey hai dirty politics in bollywood  se ounka carrear brbaad ho jaye ga🙏

Ananya pandey best debut actress? If she can act that much, I insist everybody in this world can act and gets  Oscar awards

Kounsa award hai yeh ? Anyone please tell me

Your soil did not get the award but you all got some mileage in the soil one day.
Shahid kapoor deserve kr te the. Best actor main.... Filmfare main 😑😑

Amal Mallik has said very good things about music, what can we get by comparing him with this award.
Teri sent the best 🥰🥰
TP.....Glorius
Yar plz Urvashi se sawal mat pucha kro...she is brainless..wo ese hi react krti hai hmesha...that she knows and will speak then NO i don&#39;t know ...chutiya

Bakhwaas Filmfare. Sab politics
Fixed boss, otherwise who will give it to Ananya?🤣 There are 5 faces here who are acting(in real me they are not acting)
Kangana clearly deserves it!!!Doesn&#39;t matter if you give her that award or not. All the audience know it very well.

Very well sad amaal bhaiyu ♥️
Himesh played safe.

Divine

What happened... I don&#39;t knowCan anyone tell me🙏🙏

Alia didn&#39;t even have so many scenes in gully boy....I don&#39;t understand why..I m just so sad for kangana...her acting literally gave us goosebumps in Manikarnika

Chutiya Award Show
Public voting should happen
Urvashi bachke bhaag gayii
Bollywood celebrities never take stand against Bollywood issues..... Ftti h sbki

1 son sacrificed for what, 100 sons are your protectors.... I get goosebumps hearing Teri Mitti ❤
Listen to Mrchhodo's words...divine chutia..which music superhit your heart...your MITTI will take this hour.
One like for &quot;teri mitti&quot; 💗🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳💗Because the filmfare award will come when its time has been given????
How many times have these Himesh or Krishna's shapes been found?
This Karan Johar is very evil and has created his own separate gang for every actor…the son of nepotism…Bollywood will soon divide into two gangs.
Award mile after mile is as important as the heart.<b>AMaL Malik</b>
<a href="">1:51</a> to <a href="">3:29</a> best part😍😍
Shahid kapoor deserves best actor award for Kabir Singh

urvashi is so fake

Ankita ur acting is just osm

How does Urvashi not know about anything? She is on social media like it&#39;s her elixir 🙄

<a href="">4:45</a> What kind of point of view is this that Ananya gave the best actress award to other actresses like her, okay did she think that she gave the best actress award to her film?? ???
That&#39;s the reason kangana ranaut never attends any award show

Chutiya MovieChutiya ActorChutiya ActionBollywood=Chutiyapa
Urvashi Ko Award Do{Muthbaaj Award}Meri Muth To Wo Hi Marwati Hai
It shouldn&#39;t be filmfare it should be KaranFare

Will your magic ball come?
Filmfare tatti hai tatti
Himesh is Right amongs all....

Award will be given to the best logo.
The most important film is Gully Boy and its songs, I don't know how it is found.
Ananya Pandey: best debut actress. Seriously...soty2 jury has not even seen it?
Aliya also got the award for best actress for Gully Boy, why didn't I get fat before listening to this🤢🤮😬
Terri Mitti such a awesome song , no artist could have done justice to the song other than B Praak shame on filmfare  bloody money minting business...... I will never watch  film fare from now onwards

<a href="">3:37</a>  i didnt get what happened to him ranu mandal ke sath exchange hogayi personality 😁

Himesh Reshmiyaa first time speak right and his words are correct in front of media total agree👍

Himesh &amp; Amon speech is suprvv

A song like Teri Mitti is a song that deserves an award without comparison.... A song like this is a milestone for the new generation...
He is acting like he is getting an Oscar award.
Fake flimfare award

Here we have politics... India is where we can go.
Taapsi pannu is looking so bad. She is so attractive otherwise.

Gully Boy ka ma ka bhosada... madarchood lyrics

Everyone is shocked that teri metti song has got nothing ,apna time aegaa is good but teri metti is much better 🤔

Mko to bhot si movies pasand aayi iss saal lekin award ni mila unko chlo chodo award kisi ki kismat nhi cheen skta aur omab to social media h hi we know who is best.

Ankita lokhande deserves an award for the best supporting role for manikarnila

Alia ranbir rip

Gully boy music mera la**3

Taapsee pannu was amazing

All are cowardsThey are afraid to speak the truth

Saalo sidha bolo na paisa kakar khrida h Over action kyo kar rahe ho Teri mitti is epic song time aayga song Teri mitti ke aage mitti bhi Nahi h
Film fare wale madarchod hai sale Sab milki humko pagal bna rha hai bahan ki laude

Himmesh 👌 wise words

Taapsee always tries to be the next kangana. Lol fails at it everytime. Her narcissism and dramatic view points cringe me so goddamn much.

Bollywood vampanthi se bhara hua h movie uri kabir singh teri mitti song and that movie bc gully boy over acting se bhari hui bc usko aji muh m le lo mera

Uri deserved the award

Asim fans ka Bawalsss z😛💪💪💪💪💪💪
Are all of us, we are watching our movie, we don't want to burst, we are going to be so public, and Alia Bhatt is watching the movie of these people.
Armaaan malik amaal malik they are kept like rubbish by bollywood underrated

Amaal Malik is such an amazing person!! He always speaks and stand by the right!

Best actress alia bhatt..omg..aise keise😂😂😂

Gully boy don&#39;t deserve this kind of award

Worst dress tapssi

Ye Tapsee ko ram mandir verdics se leke CAA tak sabme opinion dena hota hai , par filmfare me itna partiality hua fir bhi chupp baithi hai

Alia is one of the best female actor hai but she didn’t even have half the screen time to get best female actor in lead role Filmfare😑

Apna time aayega me aysa kya h I think bakwas lyric aur auto tune

Filmfare is biased

Dekho bc... gareebo kaa oscar.. 😂😂
Whatever it is…I should also vote…on the phone…only then the deserving person will get the award…in my thoughts….
Tapsee so talented

Kagna shi bolti h 💯
Tapsee pannu is hidden narcissistic and hypocritical actress!!!

All awards have been sold and Karan Johar is the father of all the people who want them.
Most important award Teri mitti that best lyrics best song best movie 🙏🙏

Bhaio award acting m national hi h Baki boycott kro

Divine baba

What kind of jury's point of view was that Ananya Pandey was given the best debut actress? What kind of lady is this Himmesh Reshmiya wearing?
Taapsee deserves this award

Who can get this award?
Wah what did you say Himesh sir... salute...h your...my favorite singer...... forever.....
Bas point of view hi yaad rah gya
Teri is best sent
Very nice talk, Himesh Bhai.
Boycott 2020 filmfare awards
Vo sab to thik h ye actress apni chest kyu dikhti h.....chhiiii

It&#39;s safe reactions not strong reactions ....

This way
Indian girl r dam hot bt indian men r look like jobbless scammer🤭🤭🤭🤭
Ananya Pandey deserves Oscar.. filmfare is not worth her struggle.
Himesh bhot zda free the 😂

Mr. Himesh is a wise guy.

Urvashi has no bra.
Himesh Reshammiya&#39;s reply was an outstanding nd we should accept it without any doubt

Ananya Pandey struggled a lot and got it because of her struggle.
Bycott filmfare awardTeri mitti is best song

Ye Salla Sab Gay Karan Johar Ka Plan Hai Salla Neotsim
Will he return such a free award again or will he say that we have returned it, we are serious why not keep the fake award..Farzi award is back 🤣🤣
Fake award show

Best lyrics ka award only Teri Mitti song no dought 🇮🇳🇮🇳👌

I watched bollywoodwallah from their I got to know that Filmfare awards were sponsored by Amazon ,movies like gully boy is available on Amazon and director Zoya Akhtar is the producer of most of appreciated series like Mirzapur ,etc so I thinks it&#39;s just game of money .Well please guys because of just one awards being biased , shouldn&#39;t blame whole bollywood .

Hey at least wear decent clothes
Best Actress:- Kangana RanautBest debue actor:- Ankita LokhandeBest flim:- Kesri Aisee hona chahiye tha. Kangana ke acting ke samne Aliya is nothing. So she deserves it...

Why no Kabir Singh? Shahid undoubtedly u r the champ

<a href="">1:50</a> save your time bros :D
Amal 🌼🖤
Teri mitti best song h...Kesari,, super 30 ,, manikarnika ,,kabir singh ,,mardani 2 ,, jesi film actor or actress ka rolle bahut jabardast tha......Best actress Mila kisko alia bhatt ..kangna or rani mukherjee kidher h bhai ...Gully boy kidher h inke samne kya majak kia h...........

May there be peaceMay there be vi...what a song❤️
Filmpaid awards 😂😂

<a href="">1:29</a> What did you say?
Tapsee was well deserved but not alia bhatt for 20min cameo

The rest of the story is fine but Ananya Pandey got the award after seeing her struggle 🤣🤣
Boboc

Yeh sab awards fixed hote hai.. No credibility at all. I think now it is like those who get these awards looses their image and respect because they seems undeserving.

Can you tell me from what point of view Ananya Pandey got filmfare??😾
Himesh has given very correct ans....sensible

Boobs dikhane fashion bhai sali randiya

There is a lot of controversy about your soil not getting the award.
Himesh is now an old man... Hmesa cleavage q dikhata rhta h 🤔 😂

Himesh is right

My soil 😦😦😦😦
Nicely explain by HR👍

Aliya won the Best actress category!! seriously? Priyanka , kangana and rani were way more deserving for sure.

Thappad movie will spoil a lot of relations in future..🤣🤣
All motherfuckers are for sale, be it hero, heroin or award.
🙏Teri mitti 🙏 Is 💯times better than you naked 🤣 hi to aaya hai ghanta le ke jayegaBoycott ❌ Filmfare awards.
Music has also been used sir...Shilpa Rao got the Best Playback Female award for Ghungroo song while Shreya Ghoshal was also nominated for 'Ghar More Pardesiya'..
1) Amaal Mallik right.. 😎2) Arijit Singh doesn&#39;t come because of this. 😎

Some common audience is not understanding the agenda of Bollywood..Bollywood has only one agenda which is to advance Islam. Everyone makes controversial movies, songs and dance on Hindu, Punjabi, but who is making movies on Muslims? Bollywood people have always made fun of Hindu culture and Punjabi culture..they are indirectly supporters of mafia and are making money on the back of black money and in this name they are supported by the media.
I wonder how urvashi became miss India, Look at her sense of humar in every interview ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Who gully boy beat  kesari and uri Teri mitti song is heart touching song . Why gully boy . Best debute actor is given to harsh beniwal .he done the great job.

Close karo a sub is me controversy   chalti hai

K.k ne abhe tak 500 se Jada songs Gaye hai but ajkat award nhe leya nhe cheheye or lagbhag Sare hit chutipa hai award show

Sab ke sab ganta log bau kha le ra hay sala jab public pichar na dekhe gi to pata chale ga bikari log sale

&quot;O Mother, why do you care about me, why do I laugh with my eyes, you say that I am your moon, why is the moon always there?&quot; this heart touching lyrics lost over &quot;tu nanga hi to aaya hai kya ghanta lekar jaega&quot;. Fucking Indian award shows.
Kesari ko nhi diya hai it's truly shocking
Now bb will dub this too

Bajrangi bhaijaan  oscar award ke  lable ki think  leken Bollywood ne film fair ke layak nahi samjhaye,. What a joke

Himes is right

There can be too possibilities either the judgments were shit or the it was clear settingEither way awards shit

Very good speech remesh

Filmfair is film unfair..

Amaal Malik rocks♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tapsee। nice promotion  of her film

No doubt aliya is best actress but for Gully boy she win I don&#39;t think its fair

Apna time wale to ekdam chor lag rahe hai.gana kitna ghatiya hai.

Himesh bhai se umeed to nhi thi par sahi bol gye👍

Teri mitti best song

As long as Karan Johar is killed, there will be no nepotism.
Best reply himesh reshamiyan

But I think arijit deserves his award for best singer 😊😉

The most shocking answer was by Himesh Reshmiya 🙄🙄 diplomatic
Tapsee Pannu run away man
I wonder why Himesh Reshsmmiys when become Gay! A normal, straight man in no way can do like a half-lady like this!

Bollywood industry is a joke  ......

The jury seems to be getting a little more money.
Worst and biased filmfare ever 😕.

Sale of wood...
It is very good...it is less than paying all the money.
To inn bhai sahab ko lagta hai teri mitti se best lyrics tu ghanta lekr jayega ??? music is undoubted hai 🔥 kitni chaatoge 🔥
Teri mitti, one like apna tym aayega, one cmnt
chutiya award
Gali boy k gane bhi gali boy jese third class he. Tum logo ki desh me Value nai rai he. Bas ghanta le kar hi jaoge tum third class lyrics walo

It&#39;s very easy to abuse pm modi but it&#39;s very tough to raise ur voice against unjust and unfair happened in ur industry...

The funny part is that the celebrities actually feel proud and happy after winning fake and fixed awards..Heights of Despiration for fame

Feels really sad that ppl in industry doesn&#39;t have faith on industry and are afraid to sae truth!!!! 😕😧 TERRI MITTI is the best song ever when the video came for the frst time i had goosebumps!!! I used to listen it like A bhajan every morning sooo soothing and empoweringAnd also in comparison when I saw the apna time aayega video for the frst time.... I was like wtf? I really felt awkward at frst and my mom was starring at.... Kya sunn rahi hai yeh bhai Who else thinks gully boy didn&#39;t deserve 13 awards!?

I liked Himesh Reshamiya's answer!👍👍
It was most shocking for me to hear that &quot;Mein Jahan Rahon Teri Yaad Hai&quot; Iss song was not nominated till then filmfare ny.. boycottfilmfare!!
Teri mitti main...Best ever song hai or hemsah rahega. Awards are here to make anyone happy.
<a href="">3:45</a> Nobita Aya🤣🤣🤣
Saalo gave the award to dirty songs and did not give to your soil.
filmUNfair awards
Now only the king's son will become the king..😅
Today I would really believe in Aamir Khan, that's why I don't get the award for the best actor. Ajay Devgun or Akshay Kumar should have got the award or Himesh is just doing backchodi. He is just walking around thinking that there must be a single film for such a superhit song in this salon. fare award nahi mila
Where does Ananya Pandey get the award?
Chitiya nepotism film award. Who agrre give likes. Or u can yell u frustration on comment.😂😂😂😂😂😂

Teri mitti kya singa tha madrchod ghanta ko got award me mud ko ghanta kuch nahi mila
&quot;It is necessary to win the heart award mile after mile&quot;...... Haye music se dil jeeta tha baton se bhi liya liya
Gully boy has muslim background and all bollywood mafias are against CAA. Toh yeh toh hona hi tha.... Teri mitti ko nhi mila award sharam aati h mujhe aise award shows dekhne m. Thankgod maine 2 saal phele dekhna chod diya

tapsee be like ..black chudail🤣😂😂🤣
Bollywood tatti h..isse atcha  south indian movie h

Tap pan i love you 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Himesh 🙏🙏🙏Respect

Do you remember a time when there were no hairs of snow? Today the hairs are moving in the pure clouds.
Shahid for Kabir singh... Has already won million hearts... Don&#39;t need this fake awards..

Gully boy chutiya copied movie. Usse acha super30, kabir singh, chichore ye unse kari ache the

What nonsense are you saying on these logs?
Urvashi Rutela reaction was Hilarious....😂😂😂

hahahah 4 words HATE BOLLYWOODSB CHUTIYAPA

Orvashi looking very bad

Modi fever effect...... Politics everywhere.

Amaal bhaiya love you 😘😘😘😘😘😘
Teri mitti best song
None of us will comment on this anti national Tapsi's clothes ✌🏼 She is working very hard.
Bollywood should be replaced by nepotywood

Jinko mila unko puchenge to controversy ke bare Me strongly bolenge kya..

Aarman Malik Attitude Hats Off...Wish every Celebrity have the same Attitude...People Appreciations matters not awards...Just like money awards come and go

It doesn't matter if you log in or not.
Thats why bollywood is shit,one day south indian rule all over india🙏aukat nahi hai bollywood ki 😡

Himesh sounds sensible..👍🙂
How many person  want award for SUPER 30

Much lv for amaal
Like for Manoj muntashir👍🙏
Filmfare❌Randfare✔️
All awards are fixed.

IPL = FILMFARE

Himesh won it by his sensible ans with logic

Man, how many songs did Neha sing in 1 year but still did not get an award... thanks to filmfare and mirchi people😈
Taapsee yedi ...tu bhi deserving nahi hai.. Saand ki Aankh has got good reviews for film but your performance got a lot of criticism... Kangana Ranaut deserved the award for Judgmental Hai Kya

For the first time Himesh Bhai is right 👍👍👍
I m happy 4 Amir Khan and Ajay Devgan bcoz they never attend any award function coz they take Love from public ❤️❤️❤️  lot&#39;s of love

Teri mitti is more deserving
Well said HR

You are the worst bastard, you are the media. You know who all got the awards but still you keep asking questions after questions and you are the one who licks everyone.
Indian actress pura clivage dikhayegi Koi comment kare to tharki Hadd h tum dikhaoge to log dekhenge hi

Yesa lgt heroine is allergic to clothes...modern thought's mtlb ye ki kapde kam kro hai...body ki ruri part to cover kro km se km
Ek do idhar udhar award paane se Kya Hota hain. Achaa acting karoge achaa director producers milenge.. career achaa Jayega. Most of the awards are irrelevant and load of crap.P.S- Most of the Indian audience tend to watch crispy movies rather than movies which are relevant to today&#39;s society.

teri mitti is the best

Taapse Pannu has decided to make Anurag Kaysap and Anubhav Sinha's movie and will make it a feminist.
Filmfare chutiyapa h sab

Good answer from himesh sir♥️♥️♥️♥️
STRONG reaction Ladies and Gentlemen STRONG 🤬🤬 Chutiya sala
Ek bhaii bol rha h ki milne vala Means aap samjh gaye

Best answer by Himesh Reshamiya... 🙏🏻🙏🏻
You're a gully boy and you're a gang
Very unfair with himesh reshamiya his song(namaste London) were not nominated for best music.

Controversy nahi karenge to industry grow kaise hogi! So chill

In filmfare award, why Ladies/girls are using only few inches cloth on their body, better not to use cloth, if they are so interested to their ugli body, they can show their dirty private parts also.....useless culture, showing on TV....govt should ban all these &quot;नंगा&quot; &quot;तमाशा&quot;

Himesh&#39;s point of view is much sensible and correct

Fucking Bollywood nepotism

One Like For Divine 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hiiimeeeesssssssss bhaiiii...(oh “h” is silent)... this man is a cow...😇🙏🏻...never boastful...and keeps chewing all the time!! (Maybe people's minds).
All awards are paid

Before the award was paired, neither Sholey could get the award.

Tapsee. 😍
I am dissatisfied on Ananya pandey winning best debut and best movie award......

Best actor hritik for super30 and best song teri mitti kesri👍
All these reviews are diplomatic and the filmfare people must have asked for money and the third thing is that there is no relation with the big filmfare people or no payment has been stopped from that account, all the answers have been given.
Bollywood ka best song ghanta le k jayega...What A shame
Plz give a like for Anonay Pandey  Hard work😅😅😅😅😆😆Lol

which award is this from?
Lora le lo gaully boy
2020 filmfare was fake it should be hold again . Ranveer ganja bought the award

India is not progressing because of nepotism everywhere from jobs to entertainment..

Koi kuch bhi bole par Ye film fare Award wale Deserve talent ko Behukuf  samjate hai or undeserve talent ko Award winning banate hai..Mujhe lagta hai hum Audience in ki TRP nahi chalane Dena chahiye.

Very nice answer given by himesh

Himesh never really loved me
Thug life

Chutiyapa hai filmfare award
Dil Jitna Zarrori Hai Award Nahi Best Lines♥️♥️♥️

Hey! Please check out our countent and help us grow. Thank you so much 😄

Whole Bollywood is a Product of nepotism..

She is a shameless woman who doesn't deserve Taapsee Award.
Boycott Filmfare
Sabko apni padi hai.
Everything has been fixed.
For a change Himesh made sense.
Tapasee - best actress akkkthooooooo

Awesome himesh. Very very sensible answer.

At 5.33, it is Himesh who said that he did not even know about this.
Fashion's ass has only been preserved.
Chutiya Boy got the award, what nonsense did these guys do?
ye bakwas speech band karo bhai sab fix hai

Filmfare says: Tu nanga hi to aaya hai kya ghanta leke jayega.. ➡️
Go on .. atleast this actors have guts to come and speak .. against it ...also audience jago abhi bhi waqt hai ...Filmfare ko boycott Karo

Ananya Pandey is not deserved...The award...Best Lyrics is also not deserving...

Hahaha self band Bollywood by pak funded industry

Tapsee needs a jaw shape correction  with one big slap for her antinational slurs....

Kangana best actress 😘😘👍👍👍
Film unfair
<a href="">3:30</a> aatein hi Ranu mondal yaad aa gayi🤣🤣
one like for shahid kapoor&#39;s acting in kabir singh

Himesh said excellent

Himesh really well said ... Jo jeeta wohi sikandar was one of such less box office hit, less awarded movies... But over the time people loved it...

None of these liberals and intellectuals have got the gut to take a stand against something wrong in their industry. Who in their right mind would believe them when they take a stand on national issues.

Teri mitti k best lyrics hai uske aage sb feeke hain
Dil jeet na jaruri he award jeete na jeete❤
Filmfare has also been inspired by librandhu thought
Himesh...👏👏👏
very well said by Himesh ji

Ranu Mondal won the award..
Why should those who win win? Everyone knows how biased they are. If Ananya Pandey can get filmfare then what will I say. Fuck.
audience ko ye ab award show dekhna he ni chye .......Mee to dekhti hee .Ni faltu ullu bnte h sbko

My liberal gang Mila h
Awww chor ko chor bola to bura man gaya

Hit like for tapsee ma&#39;am

Baised award,

Teri mitti jesa song kabhi bana hi nahi jisme aatma kaap jaati hai esa song hai
That's why everyone didn't get an Oscar.
One thing is not accepted in the society...yes yes the Bhosdiwali heroines are showing their body in fat clothes and pants...they are doing this again and again...so much is being seen...to a little orr you will see...orr what will happen...😜
Why ww watching on this kind of fake awards on tv ??? Boycott d awards functions

Mujhe toh gully boy mei alia Bhatt dikhi hi nahi

Kabir Singh ko Nahi milaTeri mitti song Nahi milaBC ab pata chal gaya award sold hai
How can this guy be better than teri mitti and kabir Singh

Teri mitti ko milna chahiye tha salo ne gully boy walo ko de diya

No matter the hour, the one who works hard and gives his 💯% will get the award, he will watch his movie.
Jab tak hindustan meh canima hai tab tak log chutiyeee bantee rahegaaa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awards are fake filmfare is always partial towards great talented actor actress

The name is the film award fare so bhaadaa toh lagega na ke liye hai. Take money and award... simple! And, first of all change the jury.
Thank you 😎😘😘😘
Where is your soil, friend?
Public chahey toh 2 hours me sabko bycot kr dey....isliye thoko tali.........

So what is this actress capable of wearing if she doesn't wear it.....

Wow Kitna Strong Reactions hai is video me.Aaaaahthuuu video pe.

Open challenge krta hu agar Gally boy ko ekk vi award mil gya to bol dena

Worse Film fear aword

arijit is truely deserving

Himesh Reshammiya said &quot;Point of View&quot;, on a long run award gets awarded blah blah...*Ghanta*....Award shows only Yash Raj films, Dharma Productions, see Sanjay Bhansali's films etc like bade bade Production houses are made for films... There are many underrated actors, filmmakers, music directors etc. whose work has contributed a lot but never got any credit.
Teri mitti best song
even Mendeleev did not get a nobel that doesn&#39;t mean that  he was not deserving  ....we always remember him as   father of periodic table

Himesh were is ranu mondal? Why didn&#39;t she get any award himesh😂

Himesh rocks 👊👊
Best reply by himesh

Tapsee looks like shit and what with the drama and over expression

Filmfare fixed hai... award show sb fixed h..bakwas

Abbay chutiye rapper kesari Ka gannay Kai aggay tera ganna tatti hai.Faltu Sai singer and shitty rapper

Vicky Kaushal and Ranveer Singh both should have have got best actor male

Meets the pan 🤢 🤢
I was shocked to hear that Aliya got best actress for gully boy it&#39;s very pathetic.becauae she had kangana for manikarnika and Rani for mardani they both deserve to win this category. They both are much much more talented than that of Aliya

<a href="">1:59</a> When you want to say the truth but suddenly realize that it might get you in trouble with the dons of bollywood

3.50 Emran Hashmi attends award shows😯
These sale films are sold only after the sale of Madharchod, they cheat the money and give awards, they buy the Bollywood film and then the Madharchods will be found out.
Gully boy lyrics.....ghanta

Fake award

audience be like on FilmfareYe kya bawaseer bana diye ho

Ranu Mandal should get the award of queen of attitude 🤣🤣🤣
Award public ko kuss karne k liye nai diya jaata haii tho public stay away from it....

Himesh is making so much sense.

Amaal Malik is best 💖💖
Sbse ghatiya acting tapsee pannu. Manmarzia movie watch pata jayega
