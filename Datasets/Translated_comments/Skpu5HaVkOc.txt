Epic always mine fresh movie

My favorite one

Im In Love With Ronda Rousey

family

Shit movie
i am gonna get u out of here RIP paul walker ..This is the best trailer in the whole franchise...

This is my favorite film, the scenes are exciting and tense and this film never gets boring, it's always cool 
Fast and furious 6 and 7 were best ones

The Fast and Furious peaked here 

Suspense on Cycle.. Mr Black TonyNeta ke Room ke bahar

One of the worst action movies Ive ever seen. 3/10

This movie was the end for me and always will be, everything was perfect, music, action and the ending

Paul Walker

I couldn’t make it worse movie if I tried 100%

Im here because I miss Paul! 

I have watched this movie so many times and still cried all of them

Bring Back James wan as a director.  He is one of the best.

If anyone EVER reads this. Please know something from someone who grew up with paul walker as &quot;Brian&quot;  ....  i watched every trailer (even the first one ever in 2000). I watched almost every movie in theaters up to number 7. I always looked at Paul as the main character in these movies. Right after this movie came out a good friend of mine died. The same way Paul died. The only difference was my friend was ejected. I grew up in Western PA. So Wiz was always a huge influence of mine. Not only did this movie slightly break me. But the sound track also breaks me. I pray no buddy in the real world has to go through what we did....

ive been vomiting its not that i made myself sick its that mediction seroquel was poisonous and noone is to swalow any

What we can&#39;t land? Wehave to get him back

oh wrong page

Let it come out

Miss u PaulNepal 🇳🇵
This was Paul Walker Ĺast movie

0

He ended his life by what he does in the movies

So it feels that Shaw is getting revenge right away not years later but Brian&#39;s son goes from a baby to like a toddler that&#39;s already like 3 to 5 years old

When you realize 2015 is already 8 years old:

I was encouraged by Dylan Buyers,a friend &amp; a fmr coworker who worked with me @ Wal-Mart to view this film. He told me one Christian to another that I wouldn&#39;t be disappointed,turns out Dylan was right.

4,5, and 6 made a good story Trillogy. Then after that the stunts just got out of control and too cheesy. 3 being a spinoff was fine in itself.

I consider this the last real movie

This was in a Genshin impact playlist for some reason

Best movie

paul walker is 2013 die why furious7 paulwalker
The graphics are just super! Why is this not in the original? You need to update the seventh fast and the furious for a remaster or a remake
Furious 7 (2015) &gt; likeFast X: Part 1 (2023) &gt; comment

Was that Paul walker filmed in 2013, since he died?

Awesome, 
Bro really said one last ride

Definitely the last true fast and furious.

Fire

anyone else came back to see paul walkers last movie 

Mission impossible is actually tied to all Of this if you understand the plot it all goes together Ethan Hunt actually hired everyone from torettos family because he needed a team for a mission impossible that he couldn&#39;t even accomplish 

The fast saga paul walker darla I miss you very much so much darla 
The last good Fast &amp; Furious movie

FF just isn&#39;t the same without Paul Walker 

long live paul, almost 10 years without him ️

2023

<a href="">2:27</a>

&quot;one last ride&quot; well that was a fucking lie

The best one

The only thing really carrying this franchise is the soundtrack

They gotta drop another trailer of this caliber

Fuck this is a good trailer

Fast &amp; Furious Franchise (RANKED)1- FAST 72- THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS3- FAST X4- FAST AND FURIOUS 95- FURIOUS 66- 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS7- FAST 58- FAST AND FURIOUS 49- THE FAST AND FURIOUS10- TOKYO DRIFT
After watching 9 and X, I believe that at Furious 7, the writer should have ended the series because after Furious 7, all that was shown in this franchise is over exaggerated

F7: one last rideF11: one final last ride ends now

I love how every FF since this one has said &quot;one last ride&quot;

where it should have ended

Fast 7

Last paul walker action

The “Wacky Races” sure looks interesting!

Haha wonderful
Let me write the series that comes after. Fast and furious should go on forever.

This wasnt a perfect ending...but it was good enough... should&#39;ve just buried their greed with the franchise and ended it right here as a tribute to paul

I could’ve swore Dom said: “one last ride” for the next six movies. 

The last paul walkers fast and furious our car legand

Amazing ️️️️️
Nice ️️️️️
Best fast and furious movie

The last good one

We will miss you until we see again!!  

<a href="">1:30</a>

Nice

8 years and 3 movies later, this is still the best trailer of the franchise

Where I can fucking find this movie?

In case anyone dont know this is a james wan film

Crying after seein fast 10 trailer but just coming back to rewatch this masterpiece. And requesting paramount to Stop the fast 10 plz y&#39;all are ruining it more

Man just look at the thumbnail

This trailer spoiled so much

This should’ve been the last movie.

this is where it should’ve ended

Just for you guys to know, the only reason the fast saga didnt end here is bcs paul walker and vin diesel agreed to make through 10 movie series. Eventho fast7 would be a great ending, Vin does the movie until 10 just for Paul. But it still feel so much empty without Brian ride along with Dom. RIP Paul Walker 

This movie was just so sad to watch at the end.

The best Furious ever

fast and furious 7
Girl: I wanna marry you.



Dom: I don&#39;t need a wife. I got family. 

This  Best of FF

Fast and furious 1000 .Dom - ONE LAST RIDE!!!!
Here end of fast and furious era RIP Paul walker.

Fast 6 &amp; 7 are the best

revisiting this after finally watching fast 9 and seeing the trailer for fast 10. they literally had the perfect ending to wrap up a movie franchise with this one.

<a href="">2:26</a>

Fast X is here.

This is the best movie of this franchise and the 2nd best is Fast 5

this is the bestestest

I here after 8 years..

Who&#39;s here after fast X trailer
Brian was the soul of F&amp;F series

Came back after Fast10 trailer. This series ended with 7.

Was this movie perfect movie to end it all ? Yeah. Did they stop? Nah

Best trailer for fast and furious

The OG Goat Fnf movie ️
This was the best ending to the franchise for me ️

Still in 2023 with same vibe  ️

Had to come back and rewatch before the new trailer drops. RIP PW

Now the thing I don&#39;t get about this movie, it&#39;s the fact that Nobody and Dom&#39;s crew were after Deckard for Han&#39;s death who was actually... STILL ALIVE  LOL

Om Shanti Paul Walker 
masterpiece movies 
I just now noticed that the tires don&#39;t match in the thumbnail cover picture.

This was when the series ended, perfectly.  Anything else after this was a bad dream (fueled by studio cash grab).

Top expensive cars in the world amazing video <a href="">

Still my favourite movie in the franchise after F5 and F6

The last true fast and the furious movie

One of my favourite movie of all time 

vin diesel the best forever

<b>The Best Movie Of Fast&amp;Furious Series, I have Watched this movie more than 40 time</b> 

My #1 favorite Fast &amp; Furious movie  This is when the series drove to superhero mode and I&#39;ve been loving it ever since, baby! 

i really miss paul walker.never be the same.see you in there making a lot of movies.

The fast saga paul walker darla how  do you feel on Sunday morning  darla

James wan&#39;s only non-horror movie️️
For me personally this is where Fast &amp; Furious saga ends out of several reasons. First one is this is Paul Walkers last movie, then this is the last movie where story made sense and followed natural progression, after this movie story was just mumble jumble, last movie that had comprehensive action and a bit of touch with &#39;&#39;realism&#39;&#39; after this it goes to shit, also last movie to have good cast.... We will miss you Fast and Furious franchise...

&quot;I don&#39;t have frnds, I have got a Family&quot; this is the most epic dialogue by Dominic 

This was the best movie from all the fast and furious series.

best movie ever
We miss Paul Walker️
at the start it was just about cars , it&#39;s becoming more and more ridiculous , what&#39;s next ff in space

Idk why I somehow remembered it being Roman saying we’re being hunted by our evil twins instead of tej saying it

This one was the perfect ending to the series.

Fav movie
I was in School with Luke Evans..! He was never aloud into assembly in the mornings due to him coming from Jehovah&#39;s witness  family..!

7 years ago already? Wow

I need this quality 

like i said paul walker iv so no death  no burning fire drink water
On Rotten Tomatoes, this one scores the highest in the whole franchise. And I already know the reason why. It&#39;s because of the Paul Walker tribute at the end. It is a nice tribute. I&#39;ll give it that much but personally, my favorite is the first one. Nothing can top the classic, the masterpiece and the film that thrusted the high-octane adventure of the first film into full gear which spawned a megahit franchise!

It`s a nice trailer. But why is Ronda Rousey not in this trailer??

Bye, Paul. R I P 

Can&#39;t wait to see Fast and Furious 10 

This Is the true last FAST AND FURIOUS

This movie is the perfect end for the Fast &amp; Furious series 

I don’t have friends I got family

1 through 7 are the best ones but this one is where they should have ended it cause it doesn’t feel right without Paul walker in them tbh

Kennybeats brought me here &lt;3

Shown in:Interstellar SelmaTaken 3 American SniperChappie The Gunman

I use to work in the movie theater when this trailer came out and everytime Paul Walker showed up, whole theater would get quiet while me and the other servers and food runners would hand out the drinks and appetizers.

First of all This gotta be ONE of the Craziest Best Trailer I&#39;ve seen, Second this is the BEST Fast and Furious Films High Rated High in Box Office, Third Director James Wan was one of the Best Director of our Generation, Fourth The Actors are fits for this, and last RIP Paul Walker thank you, One of the Best Movie ever made.

In this movie I like the role of deckard shaw

I can&#39;t count, how many times I have watched this trailer. That Arabic bgm 

8 is ok

USA

... ...

Does anyone know what this song is called that starts at <a href="">1:51</a> ?

Should have ended the series with this one.

Is there anything from dubbing? It was very interesting
I agree the franchise ended right here

This series just ended right there. I liked the fate of the furious just for the sake of acting of vin diesel but other than that I think there was nothing to it and as with the furious 9,this just didn&#39;t work for me because instead of putting new powerful  characters to movie they brought the old one resurrected from being dead and for the new character they just added an about 60 seconds fantasy of Cardi B. Shitty on the swing, 

Best fast franchise film

Favorite Film

I still remember finding out about Paul&#39;s death, watching the first Fast and Furious in my living room and my mother telling me about it. I was so sad

Anyone watching it in 2021

Fast and furious 5,6,7 and Hobbs and shaw are one the best action movies....

the plane scene is still awesome

Always mass

This is where the fast and furious saga ended for me. Others are probably just for fun

Let&#39;s have a look on the evolution of the US opening weekend  for the last F&amp;F movies :[2015] Furious 7 : <b>147</b> millions $[2017] The Fate of the Furious : <b>99</b> millions $[2019] Hobbs &amp; Shaw : <b>60</b> millions $[2021] F9 : <b>??</b> millions $We can notice how decreasing the franchise is through the last years when it comes to the US opening weekend, at least we see a &quot;post-pandemic&quot; miracle for F9.

I literally spent days and days to research what happened with Paul in google and Quora.

Quote from Furious 7:



(Deckard Shaw)

&#39;&#39;You can&#39;t outrun the past.&#39;&#39;



If you want to know the future, take a look at the past. We spend our whole lives running from your past, never realizing it&#39;s hitched to us - we can&#39;t ever outrun it. You can&#39;t ever outrun the past, but that doesn&#39;t mean it has permission to keep tripping you up.

It's okay, I'm wrong, I shouldn't have sutar, man, I got out of hand with Gla Galdont, without her, I can't forgive her, I don't have anything to do with her, the truth is that I gave up, I'm with her, I don't want to be with anyone anymore.

Every time I watch FURIOUS 7Listen to SEE YOU AGAINAnd See Furious 7 (THE LAST RIDE)I always want to CRY but a voice from my inside saysREMEMBER WHAT HE SAID “If one day speed kills me DON&#39;T CRY because I WAS SMILING”️R.I.P. PAUL️

Brian: You’re gonna have to jump1 second later throws Ramsey

Doctor : He’s loosing oxygen !Dom : I don’t need oxygen I got family
Lol

I’m here from future 2094 only for furious

It's not a movie
No one:Every fast and furious movie: ONE LAST RIDE

If movie is totally complete in 2013 then they realise it after two years

RIP Paul Walker... you&#39;ll be missed ️

Liked only for Jason Sthatam ..

You always  be in our hearts Paul

RIP Paul Walker

Dude. when I saw Jason fucking Statham doing a DRIVING FACE OFF with Vin Diesel...I was like......idk man. what the fuck am I watching..Transporter or Fast and Furious???  Everything was soooo on edge and crazy to see these two in ONE movie. Jason must&#39;ve felt at home there.

3 terrific action movies were released in 2015Fast and Furious 7Mission Impossible - Rogue NationJames Bond SpectreWhich is your favorite?

I want to see the full movie of fast and furious 7
Ha ha ha ha . I just sat through some of this on Netflix... , ha ha it’s the biggest load of bollocks for dead head pricks that I have ever seen. Ha ha ha it is like jamanji for 3 year olds . What a load of shit and a waste of good cars. Too much posing, hard men looking into the camera . The stunts are more suited to a game of mario bros. .  Ha ha ha ha   They should have made this like the 1960’s Batman, KAPOW! WHOOSH ! CLANG! People watch this shit ??????

R.I.P PAUL WALKER!

Why would they show the whole escaping Ramsay scene in the beginning not even a cliffhanger the WHOLE  scene

Music is cool

Jason looks like he&#39;s in his late 30s in this film he&#39;s taken good care of himself over the years

You need to be bald to be in fast n furious 

Imma pretend this was the end

Baddest movie for a real fast and furious fan I almost always cry at the end

these idiots have destroyed so many beautiful cars

How the fuck Paul Walker was at this movie???

Cena was always there, we just could not see him.

Should&#39;ve ended after fast five tbh or at the very best at 6 when they had a lunch as a family. No point in expending something great if you can&#39;t make it greater. 8 and 9 are completely joke.

Fast and furious 7 the best

After watching F9 trailer Missing that man Paul Walker ️

now this vengeance is kinda useless,Han is back,Shaw getting his duo movie with Hobbs lmaooooo

And now they are alive :v
This movie is marvellous because of it visionary director &quot;james wan&quot; and it&#39;s only movie in fast series which collected  1.516 billion USD worldwide even fast 8 just collected 1.236 USD. James wan also directed Aquaman. He knows very well how to lead the story to end. I loved him wish there are more coming from him.. Justin lin is also superb. What if they both would direct F10 surely will be remain a masterpiece of this century.

Whos here after fast 9 trailer

ANYBODY  today??

Best series of hollywood...... bt FF8 was not so good.....

Paul walker️
I love this trailer still can&#39;t decide if I liked FF7 trailer better or FF8 trailer better well I&#39;ll just wait for FF9 trailer to make it more hard on myself.

love you paul walker :( &lt;3

What&#39;s stupid about this movie is that Mr. No body told dom he will let him use gods eye to find shaw... but shaw is showing up every where so they fucked up in the movie making us feel dumb that he actually needed gods eye to find shaw but dom didn&#39;t have to look for shaw. And besides how does shaw know exactly where do is all the time?? .... .... and second stupid part in the movie is that they&#39;re putting a very bad reputations on the Arabs in the middle East about blasting parties in an Arab prince home with fake women police and bunch of prostitutes in the party .... how shameful is that part of the movie . ..

Epic moovie.

No.1 Trailer In The World

May 4, 2018

anyone in 2018???

Great movie its my favorite

The voice at <a href="">2:20</a> sounded like the man who voiced the punisher in the video game

See U at the Other Side, Paul..

&quot;Dom...Cars don&#39;t fly...CARS DON&#39;T FLY&quot; Lol I had to rewind that part a few times XD HILARIOUS

Came here after watching Fast 7 for the first time. I have watched all the other movies in the series except 7 and8....I couldn&#39;t bring myself to watch it and then when I finally could I wasn&#39;t able to because I bought a Blue-ray and didn&#39;t have something to play it in. However after finally watching it.... I feel like it&#39;s the end. I watch clips of Fast 8 and hated the plot. Also didn&#39;t like how they let him live as a prisoner in the end after he killed Han.... and then to top it off in 8 they fight along side him... WTF! Then Dom having a kid with that other chick... I just can&#39;t To me this is where it ended. With Paul. :( Maybe in the future I might change my mind however for now I just can&#39;t. May he rest in peace!

Best Family Emotions Movie In The World

Why is this rated TV-MA on FXX? That makes no sense because this is PG-13.

This movie is a masterpiece

I love FF1 and 2 after that is imposible FF....

This movie has more cuts than my wrist

&quot;The last ride&quot;

dammit i miss paul walker 

2014, Boi, i remember this as if it were yesterday.

FURIOUS 7

Once Paul Walker said &quot; If one day the speeds kill me, do not cry because I was smiling&quot; R.I.P. Paul :(

<a href="">2:22</a> &quot;i dont have freinds&quot; xD

he is alive hah nice im wondering why he doesnt want to be in fast and furios anymore or in the hollywood thing quarter mile away or across the world what does that mean and the song see you again i mean like all these wants to tell us something,something that we still cant understand

ilove that back music

Fast and Furious 7 movie on my channel
paul we miss you
Dom Torreto) If you thought this was going to be a street fight... you god damn right it is!!

best scene

Saw the fake pixar version first.

Paul walker

Fast furious is one of the so long movie series

Nice

this movie is now on netflix, wtf?

Come on, they had the perfect moment to kill off Walker&#39;s character by letting him fall to his death but no... They opted for that painfully cringey ending.

Daddy&#39;s gotta go to work is the most badass line coming from the rock!

FURIOUS 7

Only Fast 1,2,3,7 was good i said fast7 of paul walker the ending

2015: &quot;so what&#39;s the plan toretto?, one last ride&quot; 2017: &quot;just one more last ride&quot; I thought fast seven was the last ride 

But paul walker was dead here right that is his brother right?

Storyline sucked. I miss the old F&amp;F movies..

I saw &quot;fast and furious 7&quot; on the weekend, and what I liked most about this movie, was the sound of special effects, the modified cars that appear and the racing scenes. It&#39;s really exciting to watch these movies.

love all the fast and furious movies. something  about fast cars so sexxy and paul walker the rock and vin

One of the best trailers

At least Paul in some of number 7

Who&#39;s excited for The Fate of the Furious? This one was so kickass, I&#39;m very hyped for the fate of the furious

missing Paul walker badly

I can&#39;t believe such a crappy movie grossed nearly 1.6 billion worldwide. Watch movies like  Lone Survivor,United 93, Hotel Rwanda, etc. you will have a faith in humanity.

Compare this to fate of the furious trailer I prefer this a 100 time

PAUL WALKER R.I.P. MY FRIEND
