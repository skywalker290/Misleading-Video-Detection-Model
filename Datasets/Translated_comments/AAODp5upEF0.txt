I was eating dinner

That story was just the very hungry caterpillar, worms edition.

I never knew there was a ninja turtle named Michelle Angelo

Baby Felix is so cute

How does he read and translate at the same time

Thanks for the video )Why do you have these 7 candles thing in your home, it&#39;s kinda jewish theme, right..?)

<a href="">7:58</a> he looked like he&#39;s from a pop west boy group

Pewds: this one you can actually tell what it is, it’s toy story!Me: tries to think of what it could possibly be

<a href="">9:44</a>

🙂

“Sbenande” got me cackling
damn… he’s really got great defined features

Yui

Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh

He&#39;s look like a twins from everibody love Raymond in the age of 4

drawing the eyes popping out like that is actually pretty creative! i haven&#39;t seen any kid (or adult for that matter, which probably makes sense lol) draw eyes like that before

XYZ...

How does he remember all this xD ahahahh

Felix should remake his first comic

But where is the old PP captured on Nokia?

Me as a sweed too / that spell is like my old spellsAlso me: WTF

Thanks for the story, I just had an anxiety attack but the worm story combined with the calm music managed to make me sleepy and now I can sleep well despite my world burning like forest fire. Again, thanks Pewds, I bet you&#39;re going to be a great father with banger bed time stories to tell your kids before sleep, good night 🙏🏼

i can understand swedish but not his spelling and handwriting :D i needed that translation

He looked like a blonde bruce lee in his teen years 😂 damn.

What!! Felix has a sister.

Pewds should never say “I’m going to expose myself” online LMAO

Pewdiepie you could be like Mats

Today most of the kids can&#39;t write properly at the age of 6, omg

When it all started...

Watching this reminds me of how my asian mom talks about her childhood everytime..

<a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/6PHpXpLeDpbI1wK19raYDA"></a>

<a href="">8:34</a> little does he know

You're not stupid Felix, you just had a slightly special way of thinking that wasn't very smart. But that doesn't make you stupid (and like all kids have an iq below 10 sooooo......)⚛️⚛️⚛️⚛️⚛️⚛️⚛️⚛️
IN THE SUMMER, WE WENT TO CAMP IN THE EVENING AND WE GOT LOOSE IN THE STOMACH
I will tell the worm story to my kids.

ok but his handwriting was really good for an eight year old

The circle of life

Where you born on 1989? In that you said in 1995 you were 6 so I knew it right away!

Tennis is my favourite sport

Pewds: Me, my dad, and my sisterMe: wait wha- O_O

That was the best spelling I've ever seen

He&#39;s really cool when he has a long hair

<a href="">4:52</a> is it that pewds already knew cuss words or is it a swedesh word?

Who knows ?? Now he&#39;s 106 subs

Pewdiepie wrote vore fan fiction.
&quot;I&#39;m going to expose myself&quot;Is marzia cool with that?

Awesome pic 👌👌😍
Felix :im not a cool kidAlso Felix : <b>won a tennis and sailing competition</b>

Reading swedish text in english omg 😂 I am a bilingual since I was in grade school but I can&#39;t do that, its like I have to read the whole thing first and then I will open a dictionary inside my brain and shit like that to translate it😂

That spelling was horrible jesus

His childhood comic book is actually a great children’s book idea, I’ve never heard of the reverse animal eating thing, 10/10 very creative 👌🏼

He will didn&#39;t know he will be the King of the Internet and the creator of Brofist

<a href="">0:31</a> it was cute and funny🤣😙

petition for pewdiepie to read his comic to his children as a good night story.

He already told the Peter Pan vid when he opened stuff up with jack

Who just learned that Felix had a sister. Felixa?

<a href="">0:45</a> Mishelangeo was My favorite

I&#39;m forgetting the food chain process I studied in school...😂😂😂

I had the same cut at that age

Who doesn&#39;t like Michaelangelo
It’s called a bowl cut in the UK. Not a “pot head” 😂😂

Leave a like for Felix’s sister to host meme review at pt.100

What&#39;s more embarrassing is how out of sync your audio is, bro

<a href="">2:13</a> looks like Freddie fazbear in the middle.who agrees with me?

<a href="">6:06</a> that drawing looks like a frog with a nose and lipstick

Hey Felix,I am a librarian from the Gothenburg library. I hope you return the disk soon and also best wishes.Yours sincerely,Nick GurGothenburg, Sweden

Well apparently, some of the Vikings ate the amanita muscaria and then peed in other Vikings&#39; mouths and that digested mushroom was what truly hyped them up for battle. Don&#39;t ask me how they discovered it.

I really like this photo because the belt is in between my legs -felix 2020

I can actually kinda understand this bc I&#39;m Danish lol

<a href="">5:28</a> OMG MY NAME IN A PEWDS VIDEO

Yo, I know your channel wasn&#39;t as big as now, but I first saw ur vids in 2012 and I&#39;m from the Philippines! That is youtube success worthy of the newspaper lol

Felix’s drawings look like they are from a Jack Stauber animation

<a href="">4:01</a> is literally what happen to bengt when he was on &quot;break&quot;

does anyone notice that felix looks like the older brother in good luck Charlie(pj)

Hello january pewds i am a youtube time traveler in april right your swedish hair was murdered by your future self

I saw his spelling and I’m like damn he doesn’t know how to spell and then I remembered English is not his first language

“I was such a bad speller”Me: mmm ya it’s just random letters because I can’t speak sveden person language

He was a great drawer back then (No a fence I&#39;m joking)

The comic sounds like hundred years old folklore stuff

Watching this with poppy eyes 😢😟

That moose was pretty good.

It&#39;s called a bowl cut Felix

<a href="">10:58</a> Felix looks like the kid from home alone

The JetSki is literally sitting on dry sand

skloo
&quot;Who&#39;s that handsome devil?&quot;IT&#39;S THE KAZOO KID

Swedish school food is actually not bad

I think he is translating everything wrong- A MESSAGE BY THE SWEDISH GANG

<a href="">9:30</a> Thought someone was next to me talking to my ear

If you’ve lived in Partille you better at least pronounce it right // someone from Partille

Felix:I was a pot-headAmericans:PEWDIEPIE SMOKED WEEEEEEEEEEEEEED

Bruh he we was predicting the future. He caught a dolphin in minecraft.

<a href="">6:33</a> I learned that too but it was in an anime called vinland saga

i loved this

Felix: reads childrens bookFelix: copies book format but adds his own details so he does not get caught copying the bookFan: i hate u

In the start of the video Felix was reading some of the things he wrote down when he was younger and I could actually understand some of it before he translated it to English because I’m from a Denmark and Swedish and Danish have words that are actually really close to being the same😂

Child pewds kinda looked like maxmoefoe

This video is so so so underrated😔

ngl, the story about the worm, is pretty good.

LOL!😂😂POT HEAD!do you ever wonder pot head,

Sick pothead

YOUNG FELIX SO CUTE AAAA😭💗
Bowl cut

Me seeing Felix writing in Swedish: Wtf?

At <a href="">9:43</a>, it says SVEN on the bottom of the cup.Illuminati confirmed

Who tf is Mishel anjelo

Pot haircut? You mean....... a BOWL cut?

What came out first the chicken or the egg? The chicken came out the worm...

lol i have the spikehead pic with colors

T .series beat u👎👎👎🇮🇳
i like how he calls a bowl cut a pot head

Felix&#39;s American counterpart is for sure Jason Dolley, at least during his high school phase 😭

My life 😭💜
<a href="">1:11</a> cuz Brad stole it lol

Yeap. That&#39;s how I figured he would look as a child. That&#39;s why he looks like that now.

best comic ever!

Am I the only Russian here?
How come every time i come back to pewds channel, i see myself get unsubscribed?!!! I sub it every time, its been a while now so annoying, anyone else have this isse? 😪

This is too HD for me

I have a similar hedgehog toy. Three of them in fact. I bought them for my doggos to play with.

Bruh in third grade pewds looked like an off brand bts member

Felix: I think I should get the spiky hair back.Also Felix two months later: shaves hair short...なに@(・●・)@
Imagine that girl now a women terrified after seeing that helix wore that costume without underwear xD probably hating that she chucked it away tho lol

<a href="">6:31</a> Totally a Minecraft Dungeons reference

Omg I spin and pull my hair out XD

The mushrooms from midsommar 😭

That story was actually somewhat decent and creative for a kid

Is there anyone Russian?
I didn’t know pewds has a sister

the story he wrote about the worm sounds like the book &quot;the old lady that swallowed a fly&quot;

Should have Thai language Fc Thailand🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🥰
Would tap highschool pewds

<a href="">05:04</a> he wrote &quot;slut&quot;. Felix you naughty boy

Dh

I finally feel like learning swedish in school is useful

Wow!😊

Felix with spiked hair looks like a bully from a dcom

Eminem wants to know your location

Lol wasn’t there a video to go with the newspaper article? I remember seeing a video with someone interviewing you and you were wearing that outfit. I’ve been watching your videos for a long time..

The date on the toy story bit will be 24 years old tomorrow (or today in sweden i guess)... it&#39;s older than me by about 2 weeks 😂😂😂

PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then

I dont think the media hates him I just think that they&#39;ll make more money exposing someone who has influenced millions of children who are also the leaders of the next generation.

<a href="">9:56</a> why does that look like my dad when he was a kid lmao

Please can someone tell me the name of the song at the end? I’ve been asking for it since 2016 or something 😭

Felix we have the same drawing style

Omg that story was actually really good

I love this video sooo funnyBtw you looked really cute❤-❤

Seeing old newspapers ;-; AAH MEMORIES

Wow baby and teen Felix was adorable

&quot;I&#39;m going to expose myself!&quot; - Pewdiepie 2020

Meo this
he called himself a pothead. but he doesnt know what it means.

I never knew Pewdiepie wrote Inception.
the poster brought back serious nostalgia :&#39;(

I&#39;m Finnish so we have to learn Swedish and my Swedish level is literally at the same as fetus pewds

<a href="">6:31</a> a Vinland Saga reference!? 😂

Pewdiepie with spikes=Leonardo DiCaprio from the movie the beach

Ah the memories

this is so fun to watch as a Swede xD
420k  for you Felix🤙

Everytime he said pothead, I was dying

The worm game is the best game i’ve ever played when i was at young age.

The story of the worm made me laugh harder than I should&#39;ve....😂

I like how the word for end is slut

You&#39;re like Sam Winchester.
He was changing style all the time. :DWhy so much suka blyad :D :D

I thought that with this video I will realise when felix losed his legs

LOL WE CALL THAT A POTTY HAIRCUT IN FINNISH and the mushrooms are &quot;kärpässieni&quot; = fly (the bug) mushroom. 😹😹 I always wondered why there&#39;s no emoji for that mushroom. I guess they don&#39;t have them everywhere then.

Pewdiepie EXPOSED by Pewdiepie, the video.

Okay but why did you draw genitals on people as a kid

I came here because I heard this person had the most popular channel on Youtube.  I am now leaving mystified as to how and why that could possibly happen.

I recreate your worm story but its a snail

LOL funny Pewds funny video I liked this vido yes!!!! :)

Small pewds looks like the kid from home alone...

My fave videos of pewdiepie is him telling Childhood stories! Its so funny!

We called that haircut you said was pot head a &quot;bowl cut&quot; in the US. You looked like PJ on Good Luck Charlie when you were in high school. This is entertaining. You should do more of these types of videos. Lol! 😂😂😂

little Felix ate Bengt!!!
My favourite TMNT was Michael Angelo as well!

You&#39;re childhood photos are adorable

Everyone else: bowl cutFelix: p o t h e a d

Tell me why he looks like PJ from Good Luck Charlie

Felix should create a sequel to that comic

Get the spikes back

I just want to hear Felix speaking Swedish &lt;/3

jet shkee
<a href="">10:59</a> he looks like oli, the dude who is not addicted to plastic surgery to look like jimin

Bring back the spikes.

You look like Shaggy on your college years

The entire video was pretty funny but I completely fucking lost it at the transition from the media portrayal of his success story to his spike haircut lmao

Michelle Obama is also my favourite ninja turtle

felix as a child looked like the kid form home alone

Being Swedish and seeing his spelling is the best

that Swedish spelling doe

&quot;This Book Loves Pewdiepie:in Tiny Print&quot; on amazon. Support the merch that promotes the pewd! TRUE BROS UNITE FOR THE MERCH!

Wow me and pewdiepie both were blonde as children and now just have weird brown hair fun

Felix has the best story i ever heard &quot;Bing Bang Bong&quot;

His adolescent picture looked like Isak Valtersen from Skam

Those red and white spotted mushrooms are poisonous agaric fly mushrooms. They&#39;re highly poisonous and will cause complications if eaten.We love you Felix.Don&#39;t do it

Pewdiepie: &quot;They robbed my house in japan*Also PewDiePie: <b>I lost my mic that&#39;s why i&#39;m holding other mic, SOMEONE STOLE IT</b>

<a href="">0:31</a> Go Go Power PP

Felix: “Sick pot-headAlso Felix: “I don’t do drugs”

“I was balding at the age of 4”Ok so Felix is male JoJo Siwa

Felix on jet ski proves the earth is concave

Why blur out the pictures there like 32 or whatever now

<a href="">1:00</a> learn swedish as a 4 yr old

07484 737477

Stephano! miss him! XD

<a href="">4:50</a>, I don’t think Felix knows how meanful that story could be and how genius that was. “Comical genius” he stated

“Nice shade of skin color”-Pewdiepie

Is it just me, or do I see the word slut when he finishes the “Worm” comic on the full moose page

OHMYGOD Pewds was drawing in &#39;95 that is the year I was born, freaky!

When you’ve already seen all his photos because he posted a video exactly like this a few years ago

I&#39;m swedish and being able to understand his &quot;stories&quot; he wrote as a child is awesome

Haves
How much did he like tennis? 😂

Writing exciting as x t c Xtc? Pewds been rolling from a long time ;)

<a href="">11:06</a> XD that was funny

<a href="">4:57</a>Read the last word.

On one why did he drsw deatail for detail

So basically, Felix made a hentai of himself?

Smh pOtHeAd Its Bowl-cut. Mk

do the roar lookin man

Idk but I&#39;ll eat bebeh Felix

Teen Felix can gladly break my heart

When a black person asks you to let them borrow the skin color crayonYou are presented with a universal decision. If you pass the white(peach or apricot colored) crayon, you will look racistIf you pass the black crayon, you will look racistThe power move that will get you out of it the situation AND make both laugh is to give the person, who wants the crayon, a light purple crayon.

Who wants minecraft furniture for tuber simulator WHO IS WITH ME

Imagine if everyone unsubscribed...

I cant read pewdiepie comic
Ok i just loved his spelling

Felix: <b>speaks english</b>Me: <b>Tries to read</b>Also me: derwi ajaisbwis aoshwobd ajsbaus kwwenakan qksao

this warms my heart

michelle angelo tho

How dare you you destroyed my childhood

Pewdiepie: I finally hit puberty at age 29,30Late bloomers:wait,hold up

Dislike 👎 HAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH 😤😤😤😤
this is my favorite video of yours by far, very fun, and wholesome

@ <a href="">9:00</a> looking like maxmoefoe

Tiny Pewdiepie looks like a combination of Macaulay Culkin and Jacob Tremblay

Get rid of the moose and I actually like how the worm&#39;s role was reversed.

Yes- nice, a pot head.  👌lmao

<b><a href="">0:31</a></b>

We call it a &quot;bowl&quot; hair cut, boomer 🙄

damn this man makes me happy

Felix: says epic.Captions: <b>a pig</b>
Felix you were so cute!!!
That comic so sad. I felt it

Hahaha, laughed out loud at your quote in Partille newspaper 😂
Felix called his younger self a p o t  h e a d

His first 2020 video

Felix: Stop finding my old photos!Also Felix: <b>*Shares a bunch of old photos for people to find*</b> xD

Where in Partille did you live?
I know I’m late, but i think at <a href="">2:14</a> he thinks his mom told them to set the table, but i think she said that they should take a shower. The picture he made is of him showering!

Honestly, sometimes Felix sounds like a swedish version of Jim Carreys grinch

SICK POTHEAD

Beautiful comic book

Pewdiepie wanting to eat 🍄 makes me instantly think of Bjorn

Pewdiepie talking about 🍄 and explaining that Vikings used to eat them to get amped up makes me realize how many cultural depictions of Vikings in Vinland Saga were accurate.

Felix was such a weird kid. 😂😂

His old story’s probably inspired his Minecraft series

This guy knows what&#39;s business

Piewdiepie you pro men
I got my stories.

That worm story looks like poopdie from your game.

I’m sorry but I laughed way to hard at this 😂

Terraria.

Elon musk need the blueprint of that cyber truck

Like seriously graphic violence when he was like 5 yr old

i&#39;m going to cry this is my favorite video ever

U guys know new dacade starts in 2021?

Hearing Felix&#39;s stories makes me feel that ancient mythology was all just made up by children.

Thank you for the photos! Such a freakin cutie!! And you grew up to be such a handsome man. Lucky Marzia!!!

Did you ever think that young Felix look alike Sam from Supernatural

Pot cut  bowl cut

Aw little pewdiepie would never have guessed that 5 million people would be listening to his comic book 20 something years later!!!!!

Kinda look like Bryce Harper in this video idk why

We call that the legendary bowl haircut here in the states😛

I think his story telling skill is dad level already guys.

HOW IN THE WORLD I DONT KNOW FELIX HAS A SISTER

When Felix was reading his writings, my dumbass did did not realize that he was translating what he said. I was like &quot;where does it say that?&quot; Looking for the English version of his writings i- I did not realize it was in a different language

And so the decade ends...~☆♕

500 million by 2025

~Curious Internet Star from Discord☆♕

man i really just honestly enjoy watching these kinds of chill vids where pewds reminisces about things.another thing is that i remember watching that specific video where pewds talked about being interviewed for the swedish newspaper for the very first time all those years ago.. felt really nostalgic and then felt kinda strange about how you can find articles about him like everywhere nowadays.it was such a big deal back then, like an actual newspaper acknowledged a silly video-website and this particular guy making videos on there. most folks had never even heard of youtube at that time!

“Michelle-Angelo”
Felix: Here is me and my sister Me: There is another

You are an artist that dolpin looks good

Teenage Felix could play the love interest of a surfer movie

Did he just say mishilangelo 😂😂😂😂😂
Felix make video tutorial to how to play tennis

pewds was fine asf growing up

Hi

I TOLD YOU <b>Moose Ain&#39;t Vegetarian</b>
Pewds seems a bit out of practice reading the Swedish articles there... I would imagine after time it would fade some if you spoke and read nothing but English 98% of the time... and he knows Italian.

Felix is spying on his pat self with pictures and memories

<a href="">1:29</a> guys that&#39;s danish i can read that

Where Yink, Edgar, Silppy ?

It&#39;s so great when you are swedish, you get everyting haha. And the storys he skipped over was visible for like one second, so I read them. Btw he had the most swedish childhood ever. hEJ ALLA SVeNNaR

i like your potfrilla felix
Also Felix has his computer is swedish...inch resting

My DUMBASS was trying to read the diary and I was wondering why I couldn&#39;t understand it, I thought I was having a stroke until I realised it was in spanish

The Worm should be adapted to the big screen!

<a href="">5:19</a> I thought it was a UFO

You twirled your hair when you were a kid too? So it&#39;s not just me then.

Lowkey really enjoyed the comic he wrote. The imagination we have at that age is so wild.🙌🏼

High school Felix looks like he&#39;s in a shitty boy band

Felix: &quot;I&#39;m sorry Gothenburg Library!&quot;Library: &quot;Okay, but there&#39;s gonna be a hefty late fee on that one.&quot;

Now we know why he combs his hair that way.

Pewds has really good handwriting

<a href="">5:20</a> that&#39;s a goddamn plane, Felix

Felix: What was I spelling?Me: dude idk. It looks like chicken scratch. Plus I think it’s in a different language so that doesn’t help.

I wonder if you think of your old thoughts in English or Swedish. Do you remember them first as being Swedish, or does it come to you as English?

funny how your child-self looks more like you than your teenage-self xD

Happy Hanukkah
I think we all probably said &quot;Awww&quot; a few times :)

You wrote a freaking book

The animation of the story though

I always thought a mouse gets eaten by a cat, a cat gets eaten by a dog, dog gets eaten by a cow( my mom told me that dogs are afraid of cows as a Joke and i believed it) and cow gets waren by horse

<a href="">2:49</a> bowl cut*

I always Drew pink people and a girl in my Class Drew yellow people if there wasn&#39;t beige don&#39;t call it skin color ThAtS rACiSt call it Beige or Brown but let me tell you a secret Felix was right hè big pp because if you lightly move orange over the paper it becomes beige so white people should use that color

He talked about the Peter Pan thing with jack

<a href="">0:55</a> &quot;in the end we got a tiny dolphin&quot;and yes he did in one of his Minecraft episodes ❤

<a href="">2:00</a> i had the perfect hot Chocolate not to warm and not to cold and now i don&#39;t want to drink it anymore thanks felix

You are a very cute child, but in what country are you the prince? Well, it&#39;s an intelligent note, this child will surely become YOUUBER in 20 years. Please raise it carefully. At that time, I was the still young mediator who divulged the young couple. Did you remember? In fact, I was hungry in front of a long line of mediocre people lined up to see the &quot;Month Stone&quot; of the American Pavilion at the World Exposition held in 1970 in Osaka at a glance. My teacher taught me the secret art of a 10-year-old who was empty. He has since trained in the Himalayas and is no longer over 300 years old. Thanks to you, I&#39;m 60 and I&#39;m immersed in the ultimate bliss when it&#39;s time for me to finish my training journey and to share the knowledge I gained during this period. Hey, God.
