I love how he build snowman as his army to fight the enderdragon

Wow this was an epic journey, its a tradition to watch this series every year.

Such a nostalgic😢Married and now hes a dadMiss those old daysThis memory and journey brought me to tear💧😢Wish i cant time travel back to beginning of pewdiepie journey❤

2024 and rewatch this series 😂😂😂😂

EPIC GAMER MOMENT

Rip <a href="">12:59</a>

hurts every fucking time dude

Pewdiepie made me realise if he can do it with one arrow, a trident, and a bunch of snow golems, I can too.

Rewatching this series in 2024. Forgot how emotional it was

The end of this episode was so emotional

<b>Peepeepoopoo</b> made Felix do a death note reference?

<a href="">14:16</a> level? Seen this about 4 times but never noticed.

Watching again this series dec 21 2023, I will come back again next year if I needed this

rewatched the whole series after 4 years, that was emotional rollercoaster. See u in next 4 years

can anyone tell me what&#39;s the song in <a href="">17:50</a>?

I feel sad for your pets; (

This dude&#39;s a dad, married and living in Japan BUT I still remember him calling a d*mn pig &quot;PeePeePooPoo&quot;, and to this day, I too call pigs PeePeePooPoos.

<a href="">12:55</a> ender pearls :/

Losing all your gear to the void is a right of passage for minecraft players through the millenniums. A time honored tradition that separates the big pps from the rest.

<a href="">18:54</a> im crying

Thank you Pewds for these wholesome series! Loved it eversince day 1

The best minecraft series has a best culmination, thanks, Felix

That really showed a true power in minecraft boats

Still here 2023 legend

RIP Piggy

Could have used ender pearl to survive. Newb confirmed

RIP JOERGENRIP JOERGEN IIRIP UNDEAD JOERGENRIP IKEA BIRDRIP IKEA BIRD #2RIP DJ COWRIP BOAT COWRIP WATERSHEEPRIP ROLFAnd most importantlyRIP KING PEEPEEPOOPOOI may be 4 years late, but I&#39;m not late enough to enjoy all this 30 parts of Pewdiepie Minecraft Series

the &quot;get in the boat&quot; is classic pewds🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I&#39;ve been watching this series more than 10 times

Pipi pupu says yes and drops you

literally gasped when he fell into the void

Let&#39;s just take a moment to remember that Felix&#39;s first words ever spoken in The End were &quot;Pee Pee Poo Poo&quot;

to me, this this is cinema

He could have just used an ender pearl to get out of there

A story of a man and a wolf who never gave up.

pee pee poo poo is a savage

Peepee poopoo got him twice lol

🥲

Dude he should’ve used the pearls instead of dying 💀😭

the end part is emotional

Sorry I misspelled  the dog&#39;s name

It&#39;s so sad all day of his animals die but the one person who survived it all of  sven

Ender Dragon! more like Endore Dragon this mob is bad

This has been a pleasure to watch ✊

He did it for Sven&#39;s safety

The biggest loss in the history of Minecraft;It&#39;s not Philza&#39;s hardcore worldIt&#39;s not Joergen 1 or 2It&#39;s peepeepoopoo.

🥚

Fuck me when pee pee Poo Poo died I couldn’t stop laughing

best minecraft series ever, i never stop to rewatch it, hope pewds continue this series

its probably good that he got pushed in by peepeepoopoo because he would have just fallen off the platform with peepeepoopoo even if he didnt theres no way a pig would survive

This was the #1 best Minecraft series ever on YouTube.

did he do the bed strat first or did speedrunners bc i honestly cant remember

Why is Pewdiepie.... like.... ssooo boring now? He used to make jokes and shit..... Now he&#39;s just screaming.... and playing casually..... with no gimmick..... 😒😒😒

<a href="">13:02</a> dumb ways to die

Binge watching rn

Our hair is coming in nicely.

This video can make a grown man cry❤

Mr peepeepoo was a big plot twist, his betrayal will be remembered

Thank you for this masterpiece felix ❤

when he fell off the bridge with all his good loot i felt part of my soul disintigrate.

U had ender pearls

Notice the netherack?

<a href="">10:23</a> sheesshhh I literally screaming 😭😭

everyone: use a water bucket to avoid endermanPewds: &quot;GET ON THE BOAT&quot;

P P 💩💩

😂😂😂😂😂😂

May 15th, 2023

YOU HAD ENDERPEARRRLS

<a href="">5:58</a>

<a href="">14:46</a> Death Note reference

death note reference : I&#39;ll take a porkchop and eat it

He could’ve used an ender eye to teleport bro

its cool how hes wearing the same shirt as he did in ep 1

The peepeepoopoo story line: Peepeepoopoo is discovered and quickly becomes one of pewdiepies right hand men. He then tragically dies in a healing potion accident. But peepeepoopoo is reincarnated, whoever wears his saddle becomes peepeepoopoo. Many more generations are forms, and the army of peepeepoopoos help take down the mighty wither. The final incarnate of peepeepoopoo goes to the stronghold with pewdiepie, but, corrupted by power, he sees his opportunity to seize control by pushing pewdiepie into the mysterious portal. When Felix returns, peepeepoopoo is in shock, and is pushed into the portal. While pewdiepie continues to fight, peepeepoopoo goes into the poopoo state and all of the past reincarnations combine, making him able to survive the elder dragons blast. He is freed from corruption and they are about to ride into battle, when he tragically falls into the void and he is killed in the poopoo state, which means he can never be reincarnated or reborn again.

Nooooooooo peepeepoopoo

I actually cried watchinv this 4 years later

<a href="">13:18</a> the fact that he could have used the eye

That was EPIC

2

Why am I crying?

I think pumpkin head and feather falling is essential

بكيت و أنا أضحك😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗💗

The slideshow got me not gonna lie.

here still in 2023

It may be corny but, 3 yrs ago, watching these videos was the most peaceful thing for me. I still every once in awhile find myself going back to watch parts. IKEA tower forever

“ we lost many friends”(all of them)

<a href="">15:57</a> pewdipay hasn&#39;t enderperls<a href="">16:01</a>: he has any

<a href="">12:52</a> Peepeepoopoo assassination success 😆🤣

Epic Betrayal.

i didnt even see this minecraft series, i just came here to see peepeepoopoo death and ended up with wanting to see this :&#39;)

Back here once again in 2023 as always it was a good binge watch thank you pewds 🙂

Just finished watching the series now it&#39;s time to watch the hardcore series

Peepeepoopoo Made it happen now Felix is gonna kill the enderdragon without sven and joergen and without peepeepoopoo just with snowmans and then pewdiepie pushed peepeepoopoo in the end portal

My favorite Minecraft series but it&#39;s totally faked

😌

<a href="">14:47</a> DEATH NOTE ??

cheater

Did someone noticed that he try to drag dragon to the boat

OMG FELIX RELLY DONT RIDE A PIG IN THE END

OMG FELIX YOU HAD AAAAAAAAAA FREAKING ENDERPEARL WHEN YOU FALLED DOWN IN THE END FELIIIIIIIIIIX

That clip made me wants to be vegan

Binging this in 2023 is truly amazing. What a legend Felix is, brofist from me!

u know u love this series if u cry when pewds shows all the pets he&#39;s lost

in memory of all thePeople thathave servedus forever

Peepeepoopoo

i never knew this man can make minecraft so intense and emotional..

Bro actually doesn&#39;t throw the ended pearl right after he continues after pausing.

I&#39;ve watched again and again and yet I can never get enough of this... God bless you man. Also watched this serious while playing My Singing Monsters... GAMING WEEK NEVER DIES. What a throw back!

<a href="">13:20</a> he couldve used the pearls to teleport back onto the island😂

3 years.

The time he prepared for end dragon with an inventory full of boats and actually won... Cursed sweden game

<a href="">12:55</a> Felix you are an idiot for riding the traitor. He planned to kill you all along.

did i fr just cry over a minecraft let’s play

How come he doesn&#39;t have cobblestone and bed in <a href="">15:15</a> but have in <a href="">16:08</a> and his Weapon damage still the same and food is still 60? And when you look at <a href="">15:40</a> he has fishing rod and ender eyes at <a href="">16:01</a> when clearly at <a href="">15:15</a> he hasn&#39;t bring any of those.

Peepeepoopoo was probably tecnoblade. He might of betrayed felix But he sacrificed himself for him to win😭

I’m not crying you are

<a href="">19:54</a> im crying with You felix

It&#39;s 2022, and binge watching pewd&#39;s minecraft series for the 3rd times and still epic and crying at the end aaaa thank you felix lol

I cant believe Its been 3years when He started MC seriesThanks you Felix

sad ending

Felix: Arrows Cant Hurt HimAlso Felix: Starts Killing The Dragon With Arrows

This broland gameplay is more dramatic than his hardcore gameplay

Top 1 anime betrayals

When I come back to the Series I feel so nostalgic I fell like he is the best creater in the world... he is the world for minecraft he is just a magical man 😊😊 It been 2 years last I saw this Series. Cheers

It’s really the sign for end of career of pews

Actually peepeepoopoo is still alive

I cryd

<a href="">17:58</a> All gamers know that feeling

I’m watching this 3 years after the first time I watched it and it was just as amazing as the first time! Thank you Pewds for making our day even years later! You are amazing and have saved my life! 💜🥹

peepeepoopoo falling into the void was genuinely really fucking sad

I’m not crying you are 😭😭😭😭

this is soo nostalgic to me

Wew, Spetemnber of 2022

3 YEARS ALREADY????????? FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY...

Hello I&#39;m from INDONESIAN sorry for 3 years commented I&#39;m sorry😀😁😁😁

Good old days…

Here for the 1 year anniversary of this

3 years ago…

plot twist: peepeepoopoo is technoblade in pewdiepie universe

A legendary video

The fact the he&#39;s lvl 69 after defeating the ender dragon

Three year anniversary

This was an amazing series

WOW, IT&#39;S BEEN 3 YEARS

I&#39;m not crying my eyes are just cosplaying a waterfall.

Top 10 Aime Betrayals 1.Peepeepoopoo

po po pe pe what have u done

Is pee pee poo the pig or the saddle just asking?

The sadness you get from finishing a game...

PeePeePooPoo betrayed Pewds

<a href="">18:58</a> why is this so sad, I actually wanna cry. Wtf :(

Rewatching back this series brings back so many memorable memories. Ong this is one of the best YouTube series ever created. The ending hit me soo hard

What is he saying at <a href="">11:19</a>

I think that it’s kind of sus that Felix suddenly required a stack of blocks when he had no resources. 🤔

I just want to know what Marzia is thinking when she hears Felix screaming <b>PEEPEEPOOPOO</b> from the other room

Why it is so emotional?!

WHY AM I CRYING WHY AM I CRYING

Sweden I live in Sweden

Lots of Sacrifies

I mean Void Sheep

Make a Coid Sheep

Felix cheated, After he died and went to the portal again, He had 11 blocks and after he got there, he had 75 blocks.

You see how peepeepoopoo noded as pewds threw the pearl like it was all going to be fine

Fuck Bernie, peepee poopoo died the most heroic... o7

<a href="">18:10</a> and <a href="">18:56</a> made me cry way more then It should&#39;ve

Man.... what a series this is seriously like... everything about this series is just perfect.....and ofc like he said it was an Epic journey just loved it soo much thank you ✨✨✨✨😘🎉

And that’s why you always keep a bucket of water

Viewers: what did it cost (to kill the dragon) pewdiepie: everything 😔

Death note reference 🥹🥹 “and eat it!”

SPOILER WARNING!<a href="">12:50</a>RIP Queen PeepeepoopooCause of Death: PewDiePie&#39;s Excitement.

this is like my 7th time rewatching the series and i still get teary eyes when i watch it

⭐  9.9 /10    98  %  🍅    🌜

Losing all that enchanted loot hurt me and it wasn&#39;t even my loot.

Can we all talk about the fact that he used snow men and boats which were completely his ideas and they frickin worked... It&#39;s like he learned some random things through this journey and used all of them in this fight... This could be an anime lol(I have never played minecraft .. So it looked cool to me)

Best Minecraft series of all time….

while I&#39;m watching this video it started raining and rumbling outsideindeed the final boss

At the end I was crying then it turned into tears of joy

Tbh the best video on YouTube

Two years later I realized he could’ve ender pearled instead of losing all the stuff to the void💀

Breaking news! Swedish man tries to put a dragon triple his size in a boat 🤣🤣

PewDiePie Still has pets how?

<a href="">12:50</a>

i’ll never get bored of rewatching this series

That compilation at the end actually got me sad

You shouldn&#39;t kill Jean the ender dragon because shes the last of her kind and if you think the egg will keep the species alive your wrong there aren&#39;t any males to fertilize the egg

legendary

U really lived in the game it is like ur one life

The last arrow he shot contained all his dead friends, without them he couldn/ t made it

Nver thought i would auctually cry watching pewdiepie

<a href="">12:54</a> When he paused the game to reflect on his mistake.. I cackled so hard

<a href="">12:52</a> I mean you could have pearled easily... It&#39;s in your hotbar

no one’s talking about his promise to all those pets that they would kill the ender dragon together got fulfilled when he was shooting arrows

😭😭😭😭😭

När du föll ner i the void så hade du kunnat använda din ender pearl och ta dig upp!

As a swedish fan its funny hearing those   grandma names he gives to the animals

There are many life lessons to be made from this minecraft series.

Felix this is a tip  If you don&#39;t have sword or a trident use your axe Its gonna do good damage

In my opinion; this is the series finale for his channel. Mans got married, hit 100M subs and beat minecraft in the same week. Truly iconic moment in his channel’s history. Thank you Pewds🖤

&quot; We&#39;re gonna beat the ender dragon together. &quot;They actually did.

How did he have 11 Netherack in one frame and then 64 + 11 Netherack in the next? Seems a bit odd, Felix

Bro you really deserve to be NUMBER 1 you were always n1 you are and you will be ever, Absolute masterpiece his pets were same as any animals in Minecraft but how he showed love, feelings and emotions they are like real Characters and never ever ever I loved a series this much &quot;&quot;THIS IS SOO EPIC&quot;&quot;Love you Pewds❤️❤️

Still think this is the best series on youtube! Enjoyed it sooo much

i’m so emotional.

2022 and I&#39;m still here enjoying this vid like I used to

this is amazing

you are not worthy of water sheeps power you are unworthy 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑

Peepee poopoos death actually made me sad

rip peepeepoopoo :(

.r.i.p. peepeepoopooo

😭😭😭😭😭😭

felix: has emotional moment when pee pee poo poo dies sbutitles: pronuonces pee pee poo poo as baby papa

<a href="">12:54</a> i actually could not stop laughing for 10 min RIP

<a href="">12:53</a> the saddest moment in this entire series

It’s 2022 and I still can’t get over this gem of a series. Thank you so so much Felix. It’s honestly brought me joy and comfort. I’ve loved this series and will continue to love it.

His excellency Almighty Peepeepoopoo decided it was time to bless  Piedie by forging him into a REAL MAN, a LEGEND that faces hardships head on without fear or hesitation.

This was epic day and sad day

the best moment in minecraft gameplay

Peepeepoopoo how could you do this to your father, who protected you and fed you, you betrayed him once and he forgave you, then you betray him a 2nd time??

I love this part I cried the end with all the animals

when Felix said his not ready and opens the ender chest : I already preapared.

The enderman are all twerking in the boats

Okey so there is war in ukraine. BUT PEEPEEPOOPOO DIED!!!! and here i am 18 years old, crying watching minecraft!! no regrets

It&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s already been 2 years since pewdiepie revived minecraft

why is the title in Indonesian?

Dude lost all of his loot and he cared that the fucking pig died? Feels like he&#39;s playing pet simulator instead of Minecraft.

I still don’t understand why Felix let himself fall off the platform with pepepopo, he had ender pearls

<a href="">7:07</a> omg the arrow

2 years later, and it still brings a tear to my eye when I see the memories flashing at the end

Peepeepoopoo😂😂😂hahaha dude😐

<a href="">14:46</a> death note reference?

The DeathNote reference tho <a href="">14:46</a>

Still crying for the ending thoEven after 5x rewatch :&#39;)The last pic of joergen hit hard

This can make a grown man cry.

That was so emotional

commenting on 2022, crying about the end but then sike, he continiues, im so happy

and tha legend was over or was it?

<a href="">16:50</a> PewDiePie Killed the Ender Dragon!!!!!

Very nice

i feel dead inside what do i watch now

why am i crying

Pewds suddenly having 64 nether blocks🤣🤣🤣🤣

although i watch it last time, now i can finally understand that pee pee poo poo doesn&#39;t push felix into the portal. coz i heared the press button. It&#39;s the exact timing but still, still entertaining

Love this episode!

I hate pewdiepie

i literally teared

This was my 2nd time through in 2022. Literally so good, this series will hold up until the end of time! God bless you Felix, my children will watch this someday. Peepeepoopoo will NEVER DIE!!

why didnt you use the enderpearl

never forget whats in our hearts you must live on rest in peace beloved peepeepoopoo

peepeepoopoo has bro land is under control in his hand

he could have under pearled before he died :(

The ending is beautiful 😅🥺❤️❤️❤️

Man the nostalgia..and it’s been two years

I legitimately cried. Wtf that was too emotional mate.

2022 and started binge-watching this again. cried yet again.

This makes me cry 😥But IT IS SOO HAPPY

He had Ender pearls he could&#39;ve survived the fall

I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years

Betrayed twice by PeePeePooPoo….. heartbreaking

Other youtubers:kills the enderman  dragon using swords.Pewdiepie:My snowmans,rumble across the end until all subjects of end are eliminated!!!

sven is a girl

NICE JOB FELIX

what a great series... the ending makes me sad but still its a great journey to watch

<a href="">14:03</a> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

If you see in the very first episode, Pee pee poo poo in in the thumbnail! R.I.P pee pee poo poo 🐷❤

I miss he&#39;s pet that died so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺 you really made me cry for you 😭😭 pet 🥺🥺🥺 I miss the old pets so sad I have a tear bye  😭😢 bye PewDiePie

I never watched this series and even I got emotional

nice

<a href="">13:30</a> he said. go!! and defeat the ender dragon

Is it just me or who else cried

Pee   pee  POO  POO!!!!!!!noooòoo!!!!

where did that bed and enderpearl from?!!!

thank god he didn&#39;t read the ending kafka book

Lol <b>”Veteran”</b> didn’t even ender eye clutch back onto mainland when him and PeepeePooPoo fell off. More like newb lol who is the clown?

STILL A FUN RIDE

One word : epik

When you bring a trident to a dragon fight &quot; <a href="">4:18</a> &quot;

The best part is when he shows all the best pets that died😭🤧

are he died from void or not, because look at his level

watching this almost 2 years later is sad asf wow-

Questions 1

Peepeepoopoo last word before dieing  was &quot;yes&quot;

Rip all friends

Legendary Minecraft moments in history ill never forget this as i grow up

boat cow

rewatched the whole series and still think its the best thing ever created

2022 and this is still enough to make a grown man cry

January 2022, im in my bed having Covid, crying and realizing that this series was the last thing before the pandemic that made me happy. Future me if you’re out there, does life ever get better to the same point as it were when this series got out? And if you’re seeing this comment again, I’m glad to know you’ve come back to the very series that had made you happy from the start.

This is the best Minecraft lets play other than dantdm and stampey

who else keep watching this hole series without boring🤣

<a href="">18:03</a> this made me in tears

Peepeepoopoo, has infinite lives, just like water sheep these god like animals are immortal peepeepoopoo is alive as long as there are no graves for him to rest in without his physical form, jourgen #1 escaped his grave creating jourgen #2 and #3. Felix has an unnatural touch, when he grows toward something/someone it breaks/die but it will always be reborn, in physical form or in a grave. Sven has broken his destiny, to never die. Please Felix find your loved ones.

Peepeepoopoo was plotting from the start

<a href="">12:15</a> anyone notice that the trident have Sharpness 5 &amp; Quick Charge 3

I love how minecraft requires creativityHe defeted ender dragon using: boats, snow and bed

Rest In Peace to all who died in this series such a nice first season ending😂😂😂😂😂😂

He said when he beats the game he will release his coordinates!

This has been such a great series so far.Met some amazing animal friends...Lost some...But the true legends...Live on

100 million, Married with Marzia and killing the ender dragon in the same week..Dude 😎

this series made me cry again ;_; best way to celebrate my new year &lt;3

I WANTED TO SAY HIS REACTION TO THE END POEM

pewds: I&#39;ll take a paorkcop and eat itLight: iam so proud

I&#39;ll be back again in December next year. This is such a beautiful series.

pewds: hit him with the bed!<b>literally hits him with the bed</b>

OMG I want to cry......

<a href="">13:17</a> you have ender pearl, why you don&#39;t teleporttttttttttttttttttt

Amazing

<a href="">12:55</a> When the Reaper gives you a moment to think about your life before taking you forever

Not me rewatching this series for like the 4th or 5th time

Never has there been a better series

<a href="">12:50</a> sad moment 😆😂

When peepeepoopoo died it was so dramatic that i was kinda sad lol True animemoment

take a second to say RIP to pepepopo

This is amazing

Anyone coming back to this ending now and crying!? I can’t believe what an emotional roller coaster that was, full kudos to Felix for being such a masterful story teller to the point where I’m getting bleary eyed over a couple of pixel animals! 😂😭

I like how im watching this in the end of 2021

<a href="">12:48</a>

“I’ll take a porkchop.. AND EAT IT!”-PewDiePie, a moment right before glory

Here in August 2021 to feel the nostalgic

This low key made me feel sad

When u fell u couldv ender pearld back up. o.o (edit: I DIDNT WATCH THE REST LOL OOPS U DID

Turns out pewds invented the bed strategy

those who watchee this in 2021 you a legebd

I literally started crying when pee pee poo poo died

Head shot!!!!!

Where real men cried

Memories…

On this episode, real men cried

Speedrunners:THATS MY BOY

From sleeping in Nether to killing the ender dragon this series was epic!

I&#39;ve been watching Minecraft LPs for years and this is the first time I actually cheered out loud that a player beat the Ender Dragon 😂

<a href="">12:55</a> I fucking died LMAOOOOOOOOOO9

Hey PewDiePie don&#39;t you realise that when you throw snowballs at things it looks like they&#39;re getting hurt but they&#39;re not you think snowballs can kill someone

FOR PEE PEE POO POO!✊🐷

Dream be like: 👁️👄👁️

the picture really did it

Wtf I&#39;m not even this invested in my OWN minecraft world..

Why am I sobbing?! Why the hell am I ugly crying lol

Why is the end part Genuinely sad

The most emotional, happy, epic and intense ender dragon fight i have ever seen :) :(

Joergen up in heaven looking down while Felix is shooting fireworks must be thinking &quot;Not bad kid :)&quot;

I got sad when pig died

Geez i cried and this was a year ago

Great job 👏 go watch yeonmi park to save North Korea that need to be freedi

did he ever release his world seed

im rewatched the series and im still mad he didnt use the pearl at <a href="">13:14</a>

Omg pewds u coula used ender pearls to get up u stewpid innit

Very sad af the pig to die

Legend

Still love you miss this

I just spent most of my two weeks vacation watching this series and I feel like I have grown as a person.

<a href="">2:35</a> Except EDP

Congratulations, u did it And I try to beat Jean (This is official Dragon name), I hope I win in Minecraft

should have just when you were about to lose everything switch to the ender pearls that were right next to the shovel that you were holding and just throw it at the island

If someone says Minecraft is just a game, she them this series.

Imagine if he didn’t have the pearl to teleport.

When you fell with Pepepopo you course of used a ender pearl

SEED PLZ.......

Pro

can i mine this?

whoa pewdiepie has 110m subs congrats

Omg, way to copy James Wilson Uberhaxornova. Your whole channel is just copying him. He did fireworks too in 2012, and they were better too. I am not starting any old shit, Pewds, but I am disappointed that you broke your promise to quit copying. &lt;/3 :&#39;(

<a href="">13:16</a> real men cried

BRUHHH BIG BRAIN GAMEPLAY

the most emotional episode ever.

Pov: you are bored of the new series and watched this epic battle again

watching this 2 years later and remembering me breaking down sobbing at the ending of this wow its surreal its been so long and im still emotionally attached to this series

Wow i don&#39;t even watch game plays always, but I&#39;m sobbing.

I legit liked this series 10x more than the hardcore one.....

This is so emotional 😅😭

me watching this series for the 50th time and still cries at the end screen

Lmaoo at <a href="">3:00</a> pewds looked at the ender and the ender man was like “how you dare try to look at me?” “I’ll let it pass for this one time”

The real story is the story of Felix’s hair styles

Wow PewDiePie

cheater

hey you. you came here to read the comments. let me tell you they&#39;re either about what he have done this week or the death of peepeepoopoo. now get out of here

RIP pee pee poo poo

He could have pearled to safety they were one space over on his hotbar

I have genuinely never laughed harder than after seeing the instant regret on his face the second he rode peepeepoopoo off that cliff

peepeepoopoo :,(

o nvm

YOU DIDNT USE YOUR PEARLS

Use ur purls

where did felix play brofist

Can we talk about pewds names his trident power of watersheep

Pewds: I am a veteran Also Pewds:Rides pig in the end

what probably hurt worse was that he had 8 ender pearls as he was falling and didn&#39;t notice it

Peepeepoopoo is a betrayer that we Didnt voted out

Who&#39;s watching in 2021

<a href="">12:48</a> INSTANT REGRET

its still funny to me that he was pushed by his peepeepoopoo

This video proves that Minecraft is not a game.. it&#39;s an emotion....

Se voçe acha que chamou minha antenção pelo titulo em portugues esta certo

Felix get in the fucking boat Enderman

I am thankful for this series more than anything in the history of YouTube.Watching Felix learn from the beginning, thinking it would be a funny ironic play-through, then enjoying every moment...It&#39;s like getting to experience what Minecraft felt like to me when I first played it. I just got to this episode for the second time and forgot just how emotional it is and it hit me just as hard as the first time.

Mom: what did u do today Me: I watch a grown man play minecraft and get betrayed by a pig name peepeepoopoo

Music and montage of old friends gets me every time. It&#39;s the fifth time that I watch this series and every death hits as hard as if it was the first time

He could have ended pearled

The real joker

Video I miss the old days I love it thank you beautiful give us this videos it&#39;s hard to find a good you lose too many friends of Minecraft 👊👊👊💟💟💟💟💟🇸🇪🇸🇪😭😭😭😭😭😭🏆🏆🏆 your little number One gamer from me for that I give you 12%. I love that

Okay but like... Why did I actually cry at the end of the video 🥺😪😪❤️

Pee pee poo poo: <b>Alright thats it</b><b>pushes pewdiepie in the portal</b>Pee pee poo poo: good luckAlso Pee pee poo poo: <b>DIES</b>

<a href="">12:56</a> the moment OG will remember

He went in creative for sure at <a href="">11:21</a> cos outta nowhere he has a stack of blocks

<a href="">13:21</a> He had pearls

pewdiepie: I fear no man..the enderdragon : <b>exists</b>pewdiepie: but the thing...it scares me

This made me cry.

I got goose bums so many times in this video

PEEPEEPOOPOO DIED

This is so emotional.

<a href="">6:42</a> you had ended pearls

This man has never even been to the End until now and he&#39;s already using speedrun bed strats to defeat the dragon. What a legend

If you here this 2021 your a legend🇵🇭❤

Here in March 28th to remember this epic moment in history

Hahhahahahahahhahahahhahaua

Yooo dis  is epic

Pewds: my aim is 20202020 the year: yea ur aim is the worst

<a href="">20:00</a> His smile is real OMG

rip peepee poop

JoJo reference everywhere, even the betrayalGOODBYE JOJO!!!!

This episode teach us to never give up

The ending was so emotional I cried. No, I sobbed.

Descripcion spanish ????

He changed the thumbnail

&quot;I’ll Eat A PorkChop, And Eat It.&quot;

What an episode!!! First of all, getting &quot;pushed&quot; into the end portal and being totally unprepared for it. Then miraculously finding stuff in the ender chest. Destroying the beacons with a trident. Summoning an army of snow golems. Being hit by the dragon&#39;s wings and dying from fall damage. Coming back and retrieving your items. Riding Peepeepoopoo into the void (I thought the ender eyes would save you but alas no). Then came the boat strategy, which was frigging hilarious! Finally, the bed strategy and a final arrow to finish this epic fight! This is the BEST end dragon battle I have ever seen!!! ♥

Awwr so many JoJo&#39;s reference

Why am I so emotionally involved in peepeepoopoos death? :(

you can do it pewpie we blievei in yuo

He should have changed it to creative when they fell so he didn’t die and he had already changed it so he didn’t have achievements anyways

PARS

&quot;Peepoopoo! My best friend!&quot;<b>sad sven noises</b>

<a href="">13:18</a> relatable

PEEPEEPOOPOO.......NOOOOOOOOO

I am watching it for third time &lt;&lt;2021&gt;&gt;

Epic

Who here after Ender Dragon &#39;Hardcode&#39;

Yo he said his aim was 2020, He was unfortunately correct

There will never be a more emotional and epic Minecraft let&#39;s play

Why does seeing some dead pixelated animals make me so sad :(

the ending gets me everytime, i get so damn emotional man ;-; When i first watched this I was hyped :) This was an interesting journey :&#39;)

here when pewds defeat her again...😃

Who thinks that these all were prepared before

Reccomending me this after pewds defeated the ender dragon in hardcore Cool

WHOS HERE AFTER WATCHING PEWDIEPIE HARDCORE

Such a beautiful series!!

I’m watching both times he defeated the ender dragon since yesterday he defeated the ender dragon in hardcore mode. I forgot this was emotional

69!!!

Watching pewds old ender dragon fight after hardcore fight lol

Back from pewdiepie beating it in hardcore. right?

out of every legendary quote you say in the end&#39;&#39;PEE PEE POO POO&#39;&#39;

The hardcore version is good, but this is brilliant

Who else is here after Pewd&#39;s new ender dragon fight

Who’s here after pewds defeated the ender dragon the second time

This is the biggest achievement ever for a Minecraft Player 😁😁

he has subtitles in Swedish

Best anime ever  10+/10

I cant believe this video still make me cry

Efi Anamer

Bonkey watching this video before going with pews

season 1 was great

Fake il écrit pas en français

Pewds: Haha You&#39;re approaching me?Me: what? You think im nervous? Your audience....

Watersheep? more like, <b>Watershed video.</b>

No joke this vid made me cry

this my most saddest reaction to a gaming video. digging up all the memory, remembering failing friends........ but you get strength from it. That is something vulnerable moral of this story that.... you will lose friends, the closest to you, the one you love the most will have to leave you one day. So you have to be prepared for this. Goodnight gamers....brofist

If you did not watch this moment you are not a real pewdiepie fan.

Pewds in the battle: &quot;This is for all the people that were like fathers to me, that I loved like my sons, and stupidly killed&quot; Well, that&#39;s season 3 of Minecraftの世界のフェリックス done, and Minecraft ended with it.

Olum domuz yüzünden ölüyo ben olsam  şu ana karar bulduğum bütün domuzlara işlence ederdim

Merhaba

I remember when this first came out

Peepeepoopoo was working for water sheep

I mean, the man got 100 million subscribers, got married, and beat the Ender dragon all in one year.

<a href="">13:30</a> - Pepepoopoo shook his head before he died, he told pewdiepie good luck.

For anyone who’s first time watching, it gets a lot weirder after this... that god damn chicken

First Minecraft series that made me cry😊

<a href="">14:50</a> thought he was having a stroke

The squeak 😭😭😭😭

<b>PewDiePie getting 69xp makes me believe God exists.</b>

funniest mc episode lmao

watching this amazing series since the beginning of 2021, a great start for a great year

WHEN YOU WERE FALLING YOU SHOULDVE WENT YO SETTINGS AND PUT KEEP INVENTORY WHY

<a href="">12:16</a> Pewds how did you get Sharpness 5 and Quick charge 3 on a trident?

Rest in peace peepeepoopoo😭

This isn’t just a gameplay, it’s how memories are made. We’re gonna look back to these videos when we’re older and cry. Just thinking about the memories we all had. Memento Mori, Sven and Jeorgen forever.

<a href="">17:54</a>This enough to make a grown man cry.I’m not a grown man, but I’m still crying.

Ma sei inglese o italiano?

<a href="">12:15</a> how does he have sharpness and quick charge on a trident?

Was pewds saying i&#39;ll take a porkchop and eat it a death note reference?

Thank you Felix for all the memories. I was like 10 maybe younger when I first watched your videos. Loved amnesia, loved everything. I’m about to be 20 and I’ll always watch you! &lt;3

I swear he looked at every endermen

I think peepeepoopoo betrayed him as mistake because he turned around to leave because he was too scared and as he turned around he by mistake pushed Pewds.

that was epic when he summoned so many snow golems and they started shooting.

Where boys become men...

Ok, I legit cried.

The funnynthing is he used snow golems

I never beat minecraft

Dude you forgot that you said if you die in full diamond you end searios

This never gets old.

Maybe he could make army of iron golems

The saddest minecraft video i ever seen

<a href="">12:48</a> la traición

<a href="">18:59</a> I will take your revenge  PewDiePie 😥😪😫😞😞😞😞

This is sad and good at the same time

Rip PEBE POOBOO he will not be forgotten he worked so hard and fell to the void

Not gonna lie i cried

One like for Pepe po-po who sacrificed his life for the honour of FelixRIP : Pepepopo
