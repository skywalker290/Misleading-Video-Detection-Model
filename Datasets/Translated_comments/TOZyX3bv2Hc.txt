Start of YouTube India flourish 

Our movies are so overloaded with emotions and lack of reality. They routinely lie, cheat and harass girls. Not sure how all this became normal, need more social themes. Humor on reality, creativity, sci-fi..



<a href="">5:38</a> is literally the plot of DUNKI

Bring these back :_:

Hahahaha from watching this till reading his book!It&#39;s truly been a long journey

We want Animal review.

Kanans unibrow mannnn

<a href="">1:37</a> Deleted scene...... for some reason 

Whyyyy did you stoppp making videos 
Thats how love marriages are everyone&#39;s sad except the couple

Animal movie ka review tho banta hai.. bhot time ho gaya video aye...
Don&#39;t know how I missed this gem. Creepiness warning was the best

Eyebrows 

Who is still watching them 

tyoooo good

That take on unibrow and complexion Natural response

last 2 minutes monolog of inevitable fight felt like a scene direct out of splitsvilla

&quot;mom will usually defer responsibility to Da-KHUSBOO&quot;.... HAHAHAHA

No matter how much I love ddlj but till date that train scene when Raj and Simran meet, is creepy, and its super uncomfortable to think that some people are too stupid to do this in real life.

Subtitle&#39;s, man

After almost a full decade, this series is still 

&quot;simran despite the occasional miniskirt is a virgin&quot;the ladys a savage bro

Please get it back

I know you can&#39;t...but please try to create such videos again 

petition to recreate this with tom cruise&#39;s deepfake

So true dude.Useless movie. Absolute bullshit
Indian jake peralta

The fight in the end 

<a href="">10:04</a> i find this fight more interesting than the entire movie, whats wrong with me <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY"></a>

Anupam kher with the problem kya hai dialogue just 

The Great Escape of Andy Dufresne



The unibrow at the end 

&quot;I have not prepared food for the dog, you are a dog&quot; simran to raj post marriage
I vomited watching these dharti pe bhoj useless f.u.c.k

But unibro!
<a href="">9:25</a> times actors weren&#39;t acting

dude the most dumbass movie ever    really 90s audience  are so nonsense

I still love your explanations and they are still very funny. I wish you guys could have continued this.

Can we get these movie reviews once again.......

Please.  Come.  Back.

Wtf was that last review total bs it&#39;s like sst class chalu

watching this in 2023. still GOLD!!!

Yaar, this movie is so boring that no matter how funny it is, it will become boring...pr the movie will not seem funny.
Watching this for the 100th time in 2022... Dudes please continue the series

Kanan
Kanan and Andy Samberg are so similar. Both were born to make people laugh

They need to come back to review the Broadway musical about &#39;Rog&#39; and Simran

Oh my god no one is here!!
They Were Way Ahead Of Their Time!!

The Unibrow of Kanan :)

Bring back pretentious movie reviews! Now I will go ahead and post this comment on all the other videos on this playlist because I love them!

Now let's go fast, I have taken out this black tape from the wire and put it on it.
First of all commenting on an epic movie  or criticizing it you guys should be asked off because at that time this was all you could get the best of unlike the 2k kids who have zero idea on how days were like back then it was more forward looning for us which gave the same desi parents to accept kids wished eapecially a daughter wish … and yes guys were like then back then to connect to a girl because the society was different we did not have a phone or internet to just send a meme or gif to flirt through .. and a girl asking to fly and leave the house has a gut to it .. hope how many of you guys doing arranged marriage or just leaving relationships coz u had a small fight and do not contnue till marriage and comment about how parents were back then or how kids were back then .. show some respect below the 90 generation you guys do not see real life struggle .. its all so easy to criticize and these youtube videos and all , one day without your gadgets and to earn money through gadegtes you guys will go mad as an asylum ..

Indians love their India but can’t wait to runaway from it and settle basically anywhere outside of India. 

I absolutely hate this movie. I absolutely hate SRK and his typical over acting with that nasal voice.

After 7 years i am suggesting plz add subtitles

tf why am i getting this on my reccomendations today right after i turned 18?? so now youtube be telling me that i was not old enough to watch this 7 years ago????

Who else binge watches PMR?

<a href="">10:36</a> here comes the chainsawman

Still gold in 2022

This never gets old. I watched it when it got released and watched it again, biswa and kanan. Kaafi Mast aadmi log.

KANAN GILL IS AN INDIAN VERSION OF JAKE PERALTA HANDS DOWN

Come back with these stuff. We are bored watching stand ups now

I am surprised how YRF has let this video live all through these years.

Uske unibrow se mujhe anxiety q ho ra

“Guljeet kay paas mein ja rahee ho” 
That slap on Tom Cruise face is so epic...

utterly hilarious. I just went through the entire process of convincing my parents to buy an iPad on my own.

Love Kanan&#39;s unibrow to represent Kajal 

Miss the days when biswa had hair on his head also he was funny n relevant 

you feminist guys are losers - pretty sure you guys are virgins.

Tereko kon bolatha train main chadneke liye!? 

Please make more videos

PLEASE MAKE BRAHMASTRA MOVIE REVIEW! THAT DESERVES A HIGHLIGHT HERE!!!!!

Can&#39;t believe its been 7 years since i saw this video

This was was good ahahahaha!!!

her mothr was prasing her saanwla rang why did u guys make that face? it was not racist at all

he

<a href="">2:47</a> it&#39;s not pronounced payrents..

<a href="">04:37</a> chai peelo would have hit differently 3 years ago

Guys guys guys I&#39;m ded 
clear sinuses
The best part is their fight

It&#39;s like calling Shawshank Redemption, &quot;Andy Dufresne escapes&quot; 
&#39;Turning&#39; a fake moustache to a unibrow was just 

You are INDI-GENIUS 
The last part where they are bickering it&#39;s funny but you know that&#39;s what happens in real life

Bro, this is not fair.. Change the name of the channel to Pretentious Movie reviews

“Bollywoodity”

guys please come back and review no entry

If I do a Season 2 - which movie should I review?

This is still so funnyyyy 

First Rahul then Tony Stark; Tom Cruise is always the first-choice-later-rejected actor for iconic characters

man i&#39;ve watched these videos so many times, i still find myself laughing hysterically everytime i watch them

You liberals are ultimate beta losers. If you love feminism so much, you will never ever get laid.

<a href="">10:30</a> illuminati confirmed ;)
Pringles at <a href="">3:10</a> 

@ <a href="">1:16</a>  It looks like Karan is questioning his life decisions...Peace!!

If Tom Cruise had done this, it&#39;d have been the first Mission Impossible movie for him.



Can&#39;t  believe that kanan did that devin laugh  ( from money heist ) at 1: 55 ....Woahh an absolute visionary.

Me not getting permission for things I like because I’m too prideful to doing religious things when I don’t believe in it. I know there’s gonna be at least one person that gonna criticize me, so I shall say this in advance: shut up, it’s my choice and your words has no influence on my decision, though it does annoy me very much, so shut up.Back to the topic…I forgot…Whatever

epic
Kanans unibrow 
Kanans unibrow
Anyone is still here?

Guest Appearance: DOGE

The couple fight though ...made my day

Start this again plzzzzzzzzz

Please bring this series back. Do it over zoom if you have to. It&#39;s too precious to have died away so young.

I remember how disgusted I was after watching the film one week after it was released, and the friends who had insisted that I have to watch this amazing movie just didn&#39;t get it.

7 years ago???

my dad is not religious nor he cares abt grades wheres our escape

Is someone gonna talk about Kajol&#39;s baddie bestfriend who she complains to in the start?

I believe we’re told in <i>DDLJ</i> that Raj and Simran grew up in the UK—so why don’t they have British accents? Also, I assume the title was chosen so the porno version could be called <i>Dilwale Dulhania </i><b><i>Lay</i></b><i> Jayenge.</i> I’ll show myself out.

she had me at having a unibrow

Creepiness warning  all creepiness performed by professionals 

m

Remake it naaAA

SRK ️
Biswa&#39;s smile when Kannan says tum ek kuthe hi ho

Even Kanan and Kalyan acting out the marriage life skit had more chemistry than most of the main characters of Bolly movies.

Please bring it back

Last Raj Simran conversation 
I deliberately held my horses to not watch Shawshank Redemption until I read the novella &#39;Different Seasons&#39; only to get spoilers with in 30 seconds of this video... My face literally went from  to 

naari - dvesh even
Can&#39;t believe this video is 7 years old! :&#39;)

I am dead
i left my marriage for u :D omg... superbbbb

GOLD.

then what is the problem?
Jake Peralta speaking hindi
bbbiiiissswwwaaaa hhootttt!!!!

Harman Baweja, Shilpa Shetty Genelia Ayesha Takia

<a href="">

THAT UNIBROW KANAN!

Your channel is underrated guys 

They are awesome...

Am I the only one who didn&#39;t find this funny???

Review of &#39; Zubeida&#39; pls 

Stupid bollywoodness, silly glamour, bad impact on audience, chapri actors and wrong movies ..... I am not interested .sirf gooooooooooooooooooooooo hain .kin chutiyon ko dekhte rahe.damn hain .are ha daadi ko bhool hi gaye saale. Last, this Kajol has been applied today, how hot is it......
Only desi inspiration would be this pakka
Omg!!! This just keeps getting better and better like old wine

kanan and biswa&#39;s friendship is so cute.

After watching your review, I wonder how did this film do so well? What&#39;s with our taste?

the unibrow

Flirting and let your daughter go without marrying.

Why is Kanan and Biswa&#39;s fight so authentic @_@ I can&#39;t stop wheezing cuz this is GOLD

&quot;Clying in the end&quot; should have followed with &quot;crapping in the theatre&quot;

Is kanan wearing a deathly hallows necklace in the end!!

The laraaaai lol

Jab 10 th standard tha. tab mujako YouTube ne suggest kara tha meain aise he play list me save karake rakha tha. Che sala badh aaj  YouTube ne phira se suggest kara. For thank you YouTube yaadhe taaj kara ne ke liye 

Oh god that was so good‍️
Biswa looks so sexxy without his specs

Brilliant.

Kya tatti movie thi yaarrrrr...... Have to see someone roast this movie.

Today my sister told me she wants to go to a college in a different city. I showed her this video. Let&#39;s hope father approves.I never thought there will ever be a day when I&#39;ll have to take life advice from Pretentious movie reviews.

You are talking absolutely nonsense, you don't even think anything is funny or on point.
Only if I could put in words how much I miss these reviews. 

there are many loopholes in ddlj. but that&#39;s bound to happen because it was directed by a first-timer, aditya chopra. the movie only shines due to its moments and the awesome chemistry of srk and kajol.

Hold the fuck up... Andy Dufrane escapes????

Hilarious review ,  you both are my favorite comics.By the way movie was legendary .

That unibrow tho !!!!

Anupama at the end 

Omg...Denver&#39;s laugh at @<a href="">1:56</a>....

NRI Nostalgia is 
When kanan said clying in the end, I thought he might end up saying crapping in the theatre

Oh god... This video can get set ur mood ryt no matter what!! 
Funny why YouTube algorithm is recommending it now ?!

I was rofl seeing the unibrow on kanan

y&#39;all are sorely underrated. i laughed so much loool you guys are naturals

Ab to Pandemic a gaya, ab to start kar do series 2 Bhai!

very bad stereotype,,,

Binging the OG Indian Youtube content and creator &#39;Kanan and Biswa&#39; 7 years later!!  ️️️️ Missing this Jodi..  Please Do one more Movie Review together guys.. Just for Nostalgia&#39;s sake!!! You&#39;ll break the YouTube!! 

Kanans UNIBROW is lit!!!!

I come here every ~6 months.

Pakka correct

Super interpretationApt
Excited to see The Luminaries on the shelf. Watched this movie and it was awful.

It&#39;s like calling The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Duferense escapes 

Kuldeep has worst story but nobody complaints,in fact he end up being a bad guy.whatever hero and heroine in bollywood do,their morality is unchecked.

Anu chopra was quite a surprise



That &quot;Khusboo&quot; kept ringing in my head whole day 

Please bring this series back

should i assume this meme pic started from here?? <a href="">6:46</a>

Have you also still not watched DDLJ

They make such a cute couple

What is the point of bringing the deleted scene ?! They made bollywood what it is today and if bollywood wasnt there where were u two ?!!! U dont even know the wearth of your golden talents that brought indian cinema into people,s home around the wole world !!

How dare u to talk about kajol looks , she is one of the most beautiful and natural woman on earth !!

Damn Capital in 21st cent by piketty. A seminal book of our times. Never noticed it before. GG

Ye to hai
The after marriage fight 

kanan and biswa couple goals low key

Chopra Saxena

The slap at the end tho

How is making fun of her eyebrows better than her complexion being brought up in the film?? The Prem Aggan review was funny so I checked this but this is BS.

Fuvking review
Cmon say the same for Sholay now

Mein jaa Rahi hoon kuljit ke saath was the best 

<a href="">3:37</a> KHUSHBOOOOOO

Why Google 

The fact that this became the metric of Bollywood romance says something about India...Kajol : I want to go with Raj!Amrish : No. It violates all traditions that were ever invented.Kajol : But daaaddddyyyyy!!!Amrish : No. What will my father&#39;s brother&#39;s nephew&#39;s former roommate think?Kajol : But I really, really, wanna!!!Amrish : Aww...  Mogambo melt hua!  Go on, then.Utterly moving.

Deathly Hallows wala pendant pehna hai,

<a href="">5:35</a> to <a href="">5:39</a> notice biswa&#39;s right hand...notice..

God, too borrrriing seriously... It&#39;s been a downward graph since you made Gunda movie review

<a href="">7:00</a> finally someone agrees with me

Come on guys you have to revive this .... We need this in lockdown

You guys should come back 

The last skit is more like mom and son, rather than husband wife 

<a href="">9:08</a> did he just stick a tape on his forehead to get a unibrow?! 

Watch the very last second of the video and you&#39;ll realise why anupam kher&#39;s character was paired with himani shivpuri&#39;s character.. AKAHIR PROBLEM KYA HAI? 

Bauji: &quot;Ja simran ja, jile apni zindagi&quot;If...Tom Cruise: &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;
Thank you so much . I am not alone , I have seen this movie in parts on TV will never waste my time sitting down and watching this movie . Bollywood ne BOSe DK chutya kat rakha hai . When I refused to watch I remember Hutiya friends of mine looked as if it&#39;s blasphemy , but in the end good decision .

one of the most important thing I&#39;ve done in my life is to watch Shawshank before visiting this video , relief !

I never found any thing beyond a level in this film which suddenly draws a new line romance or something which makes shahrukh a romance king or something  .For me DDLJ was just a another Bollywood movie with  lots or cringe ,creepiness and illogical scenes .

The fight tho

That unibrow 
anupama is rubbish. justifying her stupid choices

the fight is epic

now we know who is gonna win if there is ever a fight btw Kanan and biswa <a href="">10:14</a>

I Subscribed where is friendship???

<a href="">9:06</a> Kanan&#39;s unibrow man 

Kanan&#39;s unibroww 
Kabutar thing got me 

Took a lot of courage but did not know why I could not watch this movie completely.

&quot;Abe ye dictionary nayi h&quot; epic

Andy samburg....

BRING BACK PRETENTIOUS MOVIE REVIEWS!!!!!

This video is indi-genius

Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol should watch this video

&quot;You aren&#39;t only genius you are indigenous&quot;. Yup! Agreed! This is based on hindustan 

N. R. I loves India more than Indians

The last part was

Tom cruise as raj manhotra
That uni brow on kanan&#39;s eye...

Why did they stop making review videos??

super

Cursing the country u live in is bad but loving your country is good. It&#39;s not aao kheti kro.

But unibrow suits her...

If you love India so much why did you leave? 

Back here at 2021! 

Watching it after 6 years hits differently man!

Wait- there are deleted scenes in bollywood movies?

&quot;Terko kaun bola tha train me chadne ke liye?!&quot;  So realistic man! 

That KhusBOO, Lmao!

&quot;she literally gives him her flower&quot;(but anupam kher gave her a flower)me:- thats the equality we want

You changed my whole perception of movie 

UNIBROW ️️️

Why you so us...that deleted scene 

Nobody:Biswa playing Raj: Who told you to sleep in the train?

Omg saw this master piece now, you guys are insane, especially the post marriage part was a killer 

The Inevitable Fight was hilarious

why have you guys stopped making pretentious movie reviews?

Can you do more Pretentious Movie Reviews?!?
After marriage fight got so serious... What is that

ALL YOU KANAN GILL FANGIRLS/FANBOIS  CAN FOLLOW MY FANPAGE ON INSTAGRAM @kgjeditz :)))I&#39;M SURE YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!
Is kanan wearing the death master..woah!!!

I will end up having a crush on Kanan, which should be illegal for my age. Sorry

Kanan Gill in this video speeks and looks like Jake Peralta from Brooklyn nine nine

Anybody 2020

The real conversation!!!!!!
Kannan is so hot!

Idk why kanan is looking like b99 main character 

One thing more in the end Raj is going to London and simran and her family lives in London as well, toh araam se aa jate

Love this

I &quot;Miss India&quot;. Hilarious!!!
All these comedians/influencer try to look very progressive and shit, but spreads dick pics 

make on rehna hai tere dil mein plz

Kanan as Simran in the end is the best thing ever 

Those steps to convince your parents for a trip seems legit...

the girl next to her is 10 times better

I don&#39;t know why YouTube recommended this channel so late!

These movies are the reason for the bad behaviour of most boys.

Who told you to sleep on the train?
@<a href="">6:53</a> professional creeps...LOL

Bachon par Daya nhi ati? Ek special video Biswa k sath bna k upload krdo Yar @ Kanan. By the way everyone else getting subscribers uploading old pretentious videos of you guys!!! Do something!!!!

Stupid YouTube is recommending this gem 5 yrs later

i m so glad ppl r able to see how shit this moovie was - idk wht the f**k it got so much attention for so long

Could someone please deepfake tom cruise&#39;s face on DDLJ raj

Watched all the episodes of pretentious movie reviews multiple times. Why you guys stopped doing it ? We all are waiting for a new one ..Might be weekly one episode would be a great hit .

They should put a warning message for creepiness  I wonder what kind of censor board we have! How can they even allow such scenes? There will always be creepy content everywhere but I think this is the main reason we need a proper filter in form of censor board but seems the filter is completely broken.

UNIBROW: A shadow flutters on the window of my eyes
Please do more of this! Please

The ending post marriage conversation was EPIC :D

The line, &quot;6 mahine se ghar ka khana kha kar pak gaya hoon&quot; hits on a total different level, during this pandemic.

Hit like if you wanted Kanan to throw his unibrow on Biswa during the fight... 

you know after 10 year you could review your these videos and find that what I have done in past....btw I am not a shahrukh/ddlj/kajol fan

Kanan is wearing the three hallows from Harry Potter in the credits scene.

it took me 3 years to realize that  <a href="">4:45</a> is tanned Karan Johar

This gotta be back, I would love to see more of pretentious movie reviews

This film is soooo fucking embarrassing  nooooooo .. nahi nahi nahi... It&#39;s so full of shit!

<a href="">#thequarterticketshow</a>

<a href="">1:55</a> makes me remember of Denver&#39;s laugh 

Love coming back to it everytime. Is anyone else rewatching it?

Hey if anyone misses this series by kanan and Biswa I&#39;ve tried to continue it on my YouTube channel  it definitely isn&#39;t as good as them but you can check it out and let me know what you think so hopefully one day it can get this good 

u should come back i had not seen this when it was trending i just started watching it and i am loving it i feel kanan should review biswa mast aadmi and biswa should review yours sincerely

That &quot;KHUSBOOO&quot; at <a href="">3:36</a>

<a href="">1:55</a> that&#39;s from where Denver&#39;s laugh is inspired.

Jab tak bollywood hai in india log chutiaa bante rhnge 
Raj &amp; Simran after marriage should be a plot to consider for DDLJ 2 

Hahaha

START THIS AGAIN PLEASE YOU GUYS!!!!
So every old Bollywood movie is creepy for them....It was shot in 1995Amd that was not creepy or stupid at that time...Bollywood was not at all advanced at that time..Do these reviews  on today&#39;s movies so anyone can relate to...Unrelatable stuff man

Mujhe samaj nahi aata ki kyun apko english mein review dena hotahain..hindi bolna kya paap hain....  Aur vo bhi hindi film ka review English mein dena.... Aap jaise log hindi ko disrespect dete hain bas yeh show karne ke liye ki apke standard bohut uche hain... Shame on this kind of indians..

After Jaby Koay&#39;s reaction!

@<a href="">3:54</a> that&#39;s a marxist book. omg kanan damn.

Waiting for your new reviews.....,
Broo he looks and sounds like andy samberg thats soo cool  not to mention both are part comedians

please come back!

But who will try creepiness at home

Am I the only one who did not see DDLJ and is still here to enjoy ta review?

When are you doing more reviews 

Was Kanan wearing Deathly hallows at the end??

Hi there is this lovely bollywood song that has just released , would love it if you can review it plzzz-<a href="">

instead of putting it as &quot;dont allow this creepiness at home&quot;, it should be &quot;don&#39;t allow this in public&quot;. Ghar pe ma-bauji hote hain rokne ke liye.

Why would dadi be unhappy? Dulhan bane to dekh hi liya bas shaadi nhi hui.

They pinched their cheeks 

Kanan&#39;s Unibrow HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

This is non sense, a boy annoying a girl and that girl starts loving him what a bullshit seriously... I don&#39;t even like movies

Who told me your children in the train?
5yearsss... N it&#39;s so amazing. Hope u review more. . waiting

Actually I hate how she and her mom plays the victims card everytime... Papa nhi manege papa ye papa woh... Jabki hota wohi hai what she wants... shadi se phle ghumna hai shadi aapki marzi se kari hu ... She goes she fell in love... Door pr Buffalo ka bell chod ke jaati india ka address nhi deti.. Bt srk reach over there.....

The unibrow of Kanan is the best part

Omg,the raj simran fighting 
You guys are awesome!!

When he said remise at <a href="">10:46</a> .... Oh.... The satisfaction on his face. Finally ....done.....Got the reference

My mind directly went to FRIENDS when he said she gave him her flower. And btw kanan gil is the indian version of Andy samberg (jake peralta)

I don't even have a degree, I don't even have food, I am dead.
Please review kuch kuch hota hai...

Why did you guys stop this series of pretentious movie review

That unibrow in the end on kanan’s

DDLJ being considered the best bollywood movie in 90s  tells volumes about quality of cinema in india..

Brilliant!!!

Hah.......Gayyyyyyy
Why are focusing so much on kajols unibrow???let her be bro

Especially for DDLJ fans! <a href="">

Anupama Chopra was 

That order of hierarchy is kinda reversed at my home. Mom above dad. Approach dad. He will convince mom

You guys need to bring these reviews back!

I never liked this movie, I always found it very over the top in all context. I just hate it

Biswa&#39;s oh my god just makes me lose my shit <a href="">10:32</a>

Please continue this!

&#39;&#39;Food prepared for you, not for you..it is a dog, you are a dog&#39;&#39;
Blloopers and deleted scenes are even funnier

Skip to 9 mins had a good laugh

Behensplaining is a copy of this!!!

Raat ko aaye toh pooch lena ?So he doesn’t come home sometimes ?

<a href="">11:26</a> lmao What does she mean by &quot;Simran, despite the occasional mini skirt, is a virgin&quot; how the hell are the two related???

Comedy with Logic 
Unibrow is hilarious

The boy without glasses looks like Arjun kanungo

Kanan&#39;s brow . I died laughing

Do more pretentious movie reviews
Do Baghban already
These 2 boys will become great comedians in future one day...!!!!!

Please review Yeh Dillagi. The Unibrow makes another appearance 

You have to do a review of this movie: <a href="">

that KHUSBOOOOOOO @<a href="">3:36</a>



Is it just me or does Kanan Gill look like Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine Nine. Resemblance is uncanny. Btw love your work.

Biswa was saying ki agar Interstellar mein woh 5th Dimension mein phas gaya toh woh complain nahi kar sakhta ki 3D kitna mast tha. But film dekho toh pata chalega ki woh wohi toh kar raha tha. Woh Murph ko bhi bolta bhi hai ki &quot;Don&#39;t let me go&quot;.

Bro on satya

Indigenous... lollolol
Anyone here during quarantine?
Make new videos!! Guys!! We miss you. 
2.3K people who disliked this are girls who couldnt take a unibrow joke

&quot;Tum ek kutte hi ho&quot; Please come back guysss

When I look at kanan ,the first thing dat comes to my mind is <b>BROOKLYN NINE NINE</b> 

Hilarious, you guys are beyond words!!!

... Anupama chopra
We need you guys back!!!!!! PLEASE restart the Pretentious Reviews... It comedy gold 

Omg, this is so funny, especially when they play unibrow Simran 

I’m so glad THIS is back

Well the parents of that generation did tell us Bollywood is shit and it is screwing up Indian culture 

How did I just discover you guys now I am DYING

Omfg. That creepiness warning. XD

This film inspired a generation of kids to see stalking and harassing women as normal and acceptable

Watching in May 2020 just to keep sane. Or am I.

Hey guys. You should do this again. Its super funny. Quite relatable.

It&#39;s been 5 years Lots of things changed

What the hell is Indi-genious

If it had tom cruise,the movie would b like &#39;bend it like Beckham&#39;

Why did they stop making these review videos? last review 4 year old?? BTW, I&#39;m watching it for the first time and loving them.

Why did you stop doing thiiiiiis? I keep revisiting these videos, which is a testament to how wonderfully written and performed they were. Please restart the reviews!

Yours sincerely. 

&quot;Next time when a guy creeps you out, please understand. He loves you.&quot;-Biswa Kalyan Rath

khusboooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

When you grow up and realise how shite Karan Johar films are. 

This was the movie which made srk famous and not swades, this tells the mentality of the audience

awww... this is really fun.. and Kannan - you look great... Biswa - you are super cook.

<a href="">1:54</a> so that&#39;s where denver got his laugh from <a href="">#moneyheist</a>

Do reviews of 2019 movies

And finally in hey baby we find out sim ran away 

This is the og of Behensplanning!!

Harassment in romantic movies were common still srk gained big female fan following from such movies. Lol

<a href="">1:54</a> Denver took inspiration from kannan for his laugh in money heist XD

Pleaaaaseeeee restart these reviews. Funny alwaysssss funny. Best duo. Much needed in lockdown guyssss

You think I&#39;ll watch the movie again after this?Hell yea. Bye

I am going to meet Kuljeet 
Still laughing my heart out in 2020!

This is so relatable man....

Yours Sincerely dekhke lagta hai ki pmr ki script to biswa hi likha hoge.

Cried laughing 

Oh man. I never get tired of this.

did anyone notice the chain of deathly hallows that Kanan was wearing in the end????

The last part about the conversation was soo good!!

Tereko train mein chadhne ko kon bola tha 

@<a href="">3:35</a> that KHUSHBOOOOOO 
Actually you are not supposed to feed birds in London

Radhe Radhe

Why did this stop!!!! We need more reviews please

Love you Kanan Sir ️
He looks like Jake Peralta

U could comment on total dhamal. It&#39;s one of the worst movie I tried to watch

Brother, this is a movie of 1995, people of that time accepted it, even today few people accept it, the movie will be declared all time blockbuster at the box office, now it will not spoil anything by making your video.
This never gets old..

Who is watching this playlist again in lockdown?

Hilarious
Omg..that couple fight at the end was too real!!
When people have nothing worthwhile to do they make videos like this...

Chahe kitna bhi criticize karo iss movie ko 1000 weeks tak aise hi nahi chali hai....for sure one of th best movie in bollywood

do more of these

You guys ruined it for me! Can’t watch it again. 

Are u the science students.....??

The cheeks pinching works though

A sea is floating on the window of my eyes. But unibrow
DDLJ Is THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME

Every time some one says My favourite movie is DDLJ My reactionWhen I say I never understood the craze for DDLJ I don&#39;t like this movie &amp; Raj can never ban ideal life partner PERIOD

Logical point when they did show nice ending for anupam  and bua character  becoz person playing  bua character  lost her real husband and can,t shoot further .

@ <a href="">4:45</a> Karan Johar 
Watching again! Fresh as new 

lol

Fight in last was real and funny but why didn&#39;t you mention the kabootar scene in which the mitti cures it lol.

Buhat lamba hogaya. Anyways I loved this movie. Later found it stupid after growing up but then realised its just a movie Yar

The dialogue &quot;kammo bua literally gave him her flower&quot; reminded me of Monica 

i love you guys so fucking much  and really respect you and your humour.

Two idiots.Biswa is highly overrated.

This is really hilarious 

Superr

Thankyou you both  Amazing work.

<a href="">9:05</a> this part reminds me so much of dhoombros

Actually.. her father was right.  She should have listened. Must be regretting her decision of running away. Well, nobody cares for the sacrifices parents make but the objections they impose.

In my house heirarchy is different.  1 society2 bhagwan= maa-baap only3 logic

Whats wrong with the scenes..maybe what u r doung is shit.. DDLJ  wa lived by all

Kudos to u guys for logically roasting the NRIs

The afterstory at the end was lit

Why did they stop doing this 

Simran: I left my marriage for u!Raj: oh... sits down* <a href="">10:02</a>

Who told you that in the train?
<a href="">3:35</a> 

<a href="">0:26</a> hum aapke hain &quot;cone&quot; lmao. Did anyone notice they even added a VLC cone at the bottom of the screen?

Dude kanan looks exactly like Jake Peralta/Andy Samberg

I didnt confuse biswa kalyan rath with Sundar Pichai at all

The fight at the end... pure gold.

&quot;we are nobody to judge people on their looks&quot;&quot;clearly&quot;...&quot;but...unibrows&quot;

I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna watch DDL anymore

I miss India 

Degree b nhi h, khana b nahi khata 
Kanan makes the perfect nagging GF

That last fight and Kanan&#39;s uni brow though :))

Kanan’s unibrow

<a href="">2:50</a> aap chronology samajh lijiye..xd
The last girl is Indigenous 

This two are so good that they really let you think on the thought of your fav. Film

this video was sponsored by Googly

Why did u stop PMR????????

Kanan gill looks so much like Andy Samberg from Brooklyn Nine nine

But that&#39;s how power structures work in indian family where mom is stay-home. dad ultimately has to approve you of leaving home for a month because you still live with your parents and not earn your own money.

<a href="">4:03</a> the ultimate sangskari weapon in Bollywood, &quot;om jai jagdi shri hare.&quot;

i just love Biswa..Since his knowledge fight video with Roman Saini  .

The fight though

Kasam se sir very nice review. Bhosdi waalo band karo ye gandapa
I have some strange magic on my fingers
&quot;She literally gives him her flower&quot;

Just one more video please 
<a href="">#sharma</a> yar I m sorry
<a href="">#sharma</a> I m sorry yar
That ‘kusbooo’ 
Unibro

Overrated shittttt

Maybe if I  understood why they stopped making videos

When are you guys coming back!!?? 

Kanan ️
At the end, she is shown running in Indian wedding ethnic dress towards SRK who is already on a moving train. Isn&#39;t train picking up the speed? Or is Kajol running so fast that she catches up with the speed? All she could have done is jumped inside a compartment and then went to SRK within the train compartments. SRK could have also pulled the chain too.

i only  noticed  kanan .. He was wearing deathly hallows chain. And m like man i want that

Then what is the problem???
COME BACK PLIS

The best part of the video &quot;tere ko kon bola tha train me chadne&quot;.

&quot;She literally gives him her flower.&quot;My mind straight went to F.R.I.E.N.D.S



I have failed in college, I have to say again lmaoooo
I wish they’d continue this. It was so funny

And resident Indians made a billionaire out of shahrukh khan..!!!

Nobody:SRK: &quot;Meri finger mein mein ajeeb sa aadu hai&quot;
Bore kar dia.. Copy mat kia kro.. Khud ka original lao

That Google shirt dude looks like, less cool version of my friend Allan.

You are not only genius you are indigenous

I was thinking what&#39;s wrong DDLJ, you cudnt find many faults. Anyways good job, maybe you had a hard time doing this review

Why did you stop with movie reviews, plz resume.

1994's chutiyapa went on for a long time
I have failed in college, I have become very upset.... breathless 
kanan has the deathly hallows symbol on in the last !!!

Just letting you guys know I&#39;m still watching these reviews now after discovering you guys in 2015. Still funny AF. I&#39;m not Indian but I am basically raised with Bollywood movies. Wish you guys would still do these videos. There are just soooo many films you could do, past and present. i.e: Race 3

Unibro... seriously guys!!

Dude wats wrong with unibrow...its absolutely beautiful n natural...she had guts to be like that man before so many years in Bollywood which is the headquarters of unrealistic beauty standards... rest all roasting is too good.

I totally lost it on <a href="">5:19</a>

The creepy comment was spot on!!

Miss them!  So many movie reviews have sprouted but none can match the hilarity and sarcasm of these two 

That was epic...they should do all of that for other movies

the ending was epic...  awesome guys

Anyone here again after kusha&#39;s movie reviews
I have laughed soo much in the inevitable fight....&quot;college fail hogaya bada ukhad lega&quot; literally my stomach hurts i have laughed so much

The last thing my father would like to see me read is Capital in.. by Piketty

<a href="">7:01</a> best partIt should

Y&#39;all neeeeeeeeeed to bring this backkkkkkkkk puhleaseeeeeeee

Just put a unibrow and become Kajol

Rice-sum

Oh how much I miss these videos 

Best movie review to come across..

Ohhhh shit!!!.. that eyebrow stuff was damn funny
I am sharing this on my facebook page only because i believe karan johar&#39;s movies has caused more problems than anurag kashyap. All the boys in my college were behaving like this.

Kanan why you so beautiful man️️️
Omg looking at this now, I feel Kanan looks a lot like an Indian version of Jake Peralta/Andy Samberg 

She gave him her flower -_-

Please start the pretentious movie reviews again

Kanan has a deathly hallows locket. how have i not noticed this in the 3664738 times i’ve watched this video

Ye boring tha

literally gives him her flower 

<a href="">2:10</a> at last somebody saying it correctly. Yes it’s Momo, not momos.

his unibrow at the end roft

Oh god I love this video, especially the last part.

sweet!!
Sharma's bride who got married has eaten the brain!! Hr 2 video baad sir khane aa jaati!
Guys you forgot that it is made clear in &quot;Hey Baby&quot; (movie) by Anupam Kher that simran ran away ... Just saying... 

Only desi is better than this shit. Just saying....

KHOOOSHBOOO!!

That unibrow was hilarious

Those eyebrows..
Love the last fight

Guys love your reviews......pls review the movie Raja Hindustani as well. If not done already. Thanks

O my god!!!!! Is kanan also a potterhead

Kanan wearing deathly hallows necklace ️
Prem ratan dhan payo
Being Creepy is a religion 

Anyone watching this in 2019

Khusboooo
how daaare youuu speak out truth

<a href="">3:36</a> khoosboo
Meanwhile kuljeet also said that ek Baar shadi ho gyi to Simran ghr me HM bhr,to he was not cheated

Our culture is best but it is very wrong to downgrade others,they r best too,and if they r not,they r very hardworking

<a href=""> please review this !!!

Raj and Simran fight was epic and the unibrow killed me 

The fact you guys pointed out on NRIs is really true

There must be a season 2 for pretentious reviews

If you guys are liking this then I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t watch youtube channel named - Only Desimust watch his roast in movies

<a href=""> Not sure which movie is this.. but would definitely like a review on this one..

Just here for &quot;KHUSHBOOOOO&quot; in amrish puri&#39;s voice 

Watched this so many times in the past and only just noticed Kanan wearing the Deathly Hallows chain in the end &lt;3

I miss these so much 

please review more movies

Harassing a women is not flirting, inspiring thousands of acid attacks is what this movie and SRK did. Moreover, women are so demeaned in this movie that she ends up with the guy who harassed her, bullied her, molested her. How they fall in love is that he says &#39;palat&#39;. A SHAMEFUL MOVIE.

Anupama chopras best...
Bring this back :&quot;c

 lame
Both of u boys r so cute

Their role play is more entertaining than all srk Kajol movies

I died at <a href="">0:32</a>

Guys this is not something small . There geniuses of comedy

Women= wear scarfs either around the neck or over the head !? 

Thank God they brought up the creepiness. I had to go through college, suffering this nonsense from multiple boys because their idea of romanace is Karan Johar movie. People don;t understand what  these kind of movies do.

<b>Clying with laughter emoji</b> INSERT HERE

Guys audio is not loud or my device has audio issue

Khusboooo lolzzz
That fight ...

“Mujhe Europe dekhna hai”The real desi parent: <b>buys her a globe</b>

ddlj will never be same for me

@Biswa you ruined Shawshank Redemption for me 

<a href="">9:05</a> to <a href="">10:24</a> 

On a PMR spree in 2145 rn

Lol

It&#39;s like Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne wants to escape 

Wish you guys made more videos like these.


Thank God I didn&#39;t watch this shit Isse jyada badi chutiya movie kabhi nhi Bani I guess race 3 bhi better hogi.... not that I watched that shit

Bhai maza nahi aaya. U did try your best but film acchi thi. Sorry

Best part starts at <a href="">9:00</a>

Bring this back dude, that end was so incredibly relatable, LOL

These guys are just amazing.I really like them ,the way they pottery the life after love marriage is just killing. It literally changes my perception about love and love marriage. And mostly importantly will never go for love marriage. Rather i will prefer to remain single but seems better then those problems which are logically expected to come after getting married the one whome i choose, using my intellect for choosing her, and that also in an age when it was hard for me to choose any subject in college while keeping my capabilities in mind .So basically it&#39;s pretty sure that there are 95% of chances, that i always had to go for single column while filling any form to be submitted.

No matter how illogically the film is made ,if audience loves it ,then director has done a good job. As every movie is made keeping audiences in mind director do his or her work accordingly. So if an illogically scripted film is hit on box office then we may blame audience not the director or writer and not even hero.It&#39;s people who should change their protective about watching films so that film makers also will try to change their vision while going for any project.Maybe i am wrong. These are my personal views about making films and am sure it will give us to watch some good entertaining films without logic been distrotted much .

Review by Anupama Chopra Seriously lolSab upar se gaya

&quot;Clying and crapping&quot; in the theatre 

Bollywood should take responsibility for all the wrong notion they spread about romance and women in India. Good job you both for addressing this.

How do you guys do it yaar?

Biswa can&#39;t control his laughter in the quarrel!! 
Last fight was awesome with that unibrow kanan too cute 

Got it. Kanan looks like Andy Samberg.
<a href="">9:06</a> And thus we found out that kannan is a terrible gf.

That preeti looks like tapsee pannu

Yeah obviously that&#39;s the kind of girl I am...tumhe pata nahi tha &quot;kyaaa&quot;  -Kanan Gill

Thank you

Maaan! You guys are the best I love Biswa and find him so attractive. Kanan looks hot as well. But Biswa, you have my heart

<a href="">3:36</a> khushbooo had me dead 
Good job guys

<a href="">1:00</a> &quot;prem prem&quot; synched up perfectly with the music. Lol

Both of you are completely dry. your cheeks will not turn red due to pressure
thats call for genius people. kapil sharma scratched head after watching

India ki sbse bkwaas movie
This video is not genius. It&#39;s indigenous.
Wait London is in UK which is in Europe and they wanna see Europe... They don&#39;t even specify ki sirf Switzerland ghoomenge humto....  Aur masti karenge.....

The end skit is extra funny because you can literally see them trying to contain their laughter 

please make more pretentious movie reviews. there is soooo much out there, you wont run out of content. Atleast, until you find idea of a new series for your channel!! Phuleez! take Kenny onboard maybe too! three of you will kill it! You guys are hillarious!

What was anupama chopra trying to say?. Xd

Who is here in 2019 press like

Too much recism in Bollywood movies

you&#39;re not only genius you&#39;re indigenous 

Why are you guys no longer doing these reviews?

I rewatch this like F.R.I.E.N.D.S.! Also, EPIC fight between Simran and Raj!

Kanan&#39;s impression of Kajol with unibrow

She married rAj for his money guys .. she is not going to cook after marriage .

Kanan n Biswa….superb guy, luv ur performance….wo jo last scene wala hai jahan pe biswa is likk main apne doston k sath ja raha hai is hilarious 
To phir problem kya hai? Lol! Is this a crossover episode?

In Amrish Puri's voice<b>Goosebumps</b>
Iconic

I am shipping Kanan and Kalyan..the fight in the end was too real 

Reading James Glieck!

&quot;Degree Bhi Nahin Hai &quot;and then &quot;Khana bhi Nahin Khata Ghar Pe !&quot;

OMG...!!! Karan you are wearing deathly hallows necklace..... Love it....
OMG...!!! Karan you are wearing deathly hallows necklace..... Love it....
Very true about NRIs hating the foreign country

Oh my God!!!!! I just noticed your locket around your neck....its awesome!!!!!

U are indigenous... :-D
Insterstellar wala jokelmao
2019 

sub to pewdiepie please

<a href="">4:46</a> Guess who?

HAHAHA Why does Kanan Gill have a Death Hallows locket in the last outtake

Dude their chemistry is out of this world. I ship them :3

Please start this again .. please

The extraordinary love stories are the ordinary ones...

1. Ddlj was chosen because it’s catchy and there was nothing to hide about the ending. 2. Gud point/roast3. Monobrow roasts r stupid. It’s like calling someone brown, the focus should’ve instead been that even though she has a monobrow the most good looking guy in the world fell for her. 4. NRI. Seriously. Can’t say anything about this because I doubt anyone took this point seriously. 5. The whole badtameezy part was gud point. But this movie isn’t saying badtameezy karo, it’s showing the journey of a avaara without a heart to a caring man with one. 6. It’s still the benchmark for romance movies. 7. All the people he mentioned except for bua weren’t sad. Daadi already saw her as a bride. Priti was smiling at the end coz she believes in true love. Kuljeet was a bad man with bad intentions, villain, so just like every single movie, the antagonist was unhappy.7. The whole about future was stupid. The movie is about raj’s journey into becoming a man. I’m not saying this coz I luv the movie but because it’s a disappointing and terrible roast. Literally all of this happens in most films even now. Except they hv more avaarapanti. More unnecessary violence and even more stupid transitions from hate to love. So rly the most Bollywood ever point is too stupid.

<a href="">8:20</a> Dead

indigenious
<a href="">10:54</a>  :D

Okay, I&#39;ve to comment this... Am I the only one who noticed Deathly hallows (Harry Potter) on Kannan&#39;s neck? Is it really deathly Hallows or am I hallucinating?

Do review of Naksha movie ( sunny deol and vivek oberai)

&quot;meri ungliyo me kuch ajeeb sa jadu hai&quot; LOL Aur ye chutiya industry ka star hai.  I&#39;ve never seen DDLJ and don&#39;t intend on.

Anupama at the end 

&quot;Tereko koan bola tha train me chadhne kliye&quot; laughed so hard 

I love the Pun at <a href="">5:26</a> XD

Khushbu is my ex name actually,and I love the way you called her
What about that line when Raj says &quot;main ek hindustani ladhki ki izzat........&quot; means baki Duniya ki ladhkiyon ki koi izzat nahi Hai

BRING THIS BACK PLSSS

I was stressed, started watching PMR again (doing marathon again) ,now I feel better

<a href="">6:57</a> 

 you guys
JALLAD please

This movie went well only because of the theme song and Shahrukh Khan's acting... Otherwise the story of this movie is 100% correct!
By the way that Kuljit wasn&#39;t a &quot;nice&quot; guy..

Can you kindly put an English translation so us “the gaijin” could understand the punchline.

That's why you're here
Best review evvver..!
Why the fuck was that fight in the end so relatable? Is it good acting? 

It's not that funny
Others channel just reupload your videos and getting more views

i fell off my chair when he came with that unibrow

Indians are the only people who are racist against themselves 

“Abey ye dictionary nehi hai”

<a href="">3:07</a> this is the first time I&#39;m noticing the French press coffee maker in DDLJ, and I&#39;ve watched it more than once

Love you both yar...
This is amazing!

That unibrow.

That time of shit subtitle

why u guys speaking in english ?
I love the way you guys improv shit 

EXERCISE!!!

If Yash Chopra had known that somebody like you would make a pretentious movie review one day, more than 20 years later, then he would&#39;ve never ever made the film ever.Even Shahrukh Khan would not approve of the stunts he has shown doing in the movie.He&#39;s like &quot;Bhad main jaye dulhan, main toh patli gali se kalti ho jaonga.&quot;

&quot;Tera face chadi dalega tho kaisa lagegea&quot;dats so biswa ?????????
Just for the record- only NRI’s in movies complain. Most actual NRI’s shit on India. Sorry but ask literally any NRI

BRIINGG THHEESSEE FOOOKINGG BAAACKKKKK ..!!

It&#39;s like calling Shawshank Redemption Andy dufresne escapes.  Ded
Does kanan Gill look a little like Jake peralta from b99

This was really hilarious !!! You guys did a great job !!! Love to both !!

Biswas Google t-shirt

Do Thugs of Hindostan!!!!!!

Biswa- Interstellar me jab wo 5D space me fas jaata hai then he can&#39;t complain &quot;Aree 3D kitna mast tha&quot;Kanan- 5D beings se agar milega to bolega &quot;Hum rehte yaha hai lekin humara dil abhi bhi 3D me hai&quot;..I literally died at these 

Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuperb 
I lost my shit when tom cruise got slapped . 

Whoelse watching in 2018

And at <a href="">10:33</a>, Kanan uses the Deathly Hallows to prevent himself from dying after watching the movie..

I need more of these

khusboooo!!!!

Is that a deathly hallows chain on Kanan in the end?

I am an Indian girl living in Shanghai, China because I married a Chinese guy, but nostalgia really hits you hard when you leave the country. By the time you really start missing your country, it&#39;s too late to go back. But it is real. No matter how developed the other countries are, the mysticism and richness of Indian culture pulls you back like crazy. So much so that I started criticising China on Quora and became a most veiwed writer on the topic of China lol.

Every once in a while, I watch all these videos again, aur kuchh better karne ko hai hi nahi

I am going beyond the dust.
Oh man the unibrow

O My God!      I just can&#39;t stop laughing

Tom cruise romancing kajol 
Then what is the problem? <a href="">11:43</a>
Imagine if this movie was released in 2018

u should not have made fun of unibrow... its bad.. i&#39;m also

PMR  So relatable and hilarious  You guys are awesome 

Another review pleeeeeeeaseee!!

I am on a PMR marathon &amp; I wholeheartedly agree with everything but Kuljeet wasn’t a “nice guy”, he was an asshole.

The reason why ddlj was removed from maratha mandir

Omg!!! Awesomeeee!!!!

Abey...ye dictionary nai hai... 
The inevitable fight kills me

Please do a pretentious movie review of Mard..

Review- The hero, koi mil gaya

U got dislike as well in this video... Because of ddlj hehhehhe

<b>What strange things have happened to my fingers*...sister</b>  but do laugh.
shah rukh’s “ae ae ae” LMAO
My problem was like why Europe Europe? Name the country plus doesn&#39;t she already live in England?

Why it isn&#39;t &quot;pretentious movie reviews&quot; anymore? And just &quot;Kanan Gill&quot;?

omg that damn right at kajol chanting mantra

That NRI nostalgia point was spot on.. my cousins are in abroad but their behaviour are cringeworthy when they criticize abroad and behave like missing India. I m like: then come here, u were not extradited..

Hii, I think you guys should do a movie review on Koi Mil Gaya. I love your reviews and die laughing everytime !!!

<a href="">9:48</a> Man, lost it then

I literally spit water when I saw kabootar...dead

Khusboooo
Hilarious af

Dil to pagal hai review

August 2018 and I still can&#39;t stop watching it again and again. More, please!

Had to rewatch the whole video with concentration to see if there&#39;s too much swearing or anything just because Mom wanted to see it too 

There is a wave of light on the windows of my eyes…but….unibrow…..
That Unibrow joke was quite disrespectful for women who prefer to live and remain naturally beautiful ..else it was okay
