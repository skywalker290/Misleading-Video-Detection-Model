Some time movie reviewers also made mistakes. This is one mistake he did. Did he realized or not. Reviewer mind set also need good mood. When he is in bad mood some big film released. He have to give review to his job done. Book my show have   better reviews to follow. reviewers. How one guy impose his opinion  to others. Did he have lakhs of peoples perception only in his brain.

He is good at english speaking . With his speaking skills he can made hit film to flop. He deserves prime minister job beside the king. 2023 now realizing saaho is good film compare many worse films in bollywood. Who he&#39;ll  he give rating 1. For his english skills 5/5. For his rating skills I will give 1/5

Prabhas fans

Someone review where his neck went

Audience:why are you saying fake reviewsCritics: this is business

Oh cmon man it wasn’t that bad I would have given 2.5

He is very baised reviewer....

Nice..... PAID CRITICS. how can you even spread such a negative review on such a great movie?

These Celebrities are trying to remark prabhas but he is in very high then they

Piccha na kodaka langa yedava
Saaho made critics to sit on 200° hotseat 🔥

We should boycott this masand..he is staged

Omg he is just like Karan johar His voice is so irritating who wants to here him 🦠🦠

i now understand why you give out these reviews like this... imagine if this same story was made by some from bollywood...oh wait you&#39;d never make these movies coz you bwood prefers other movies more (which pay you to review not so bad which is actually good in your perspective) xD oh and yeah after watching your other trash reviews...and ratings to them...don&#39;t call yourself a critic and i feel pity for those who call you that.. just become a English lecturer and maybe try rapping coz your flow is great.. i&#39;m positive about this coz you gave this film a 1.5 and gave soty2 2.5 like i give a f, but others who might not know about you.. might actually believe you or the way you say these things make them intrigued and make em agree w you.

saaho is average. 2/5

After seeing the movie.. =I got thunder clap headache in such quarantine hours... But wait afterSeeing this review <a href="">#which</a> out of logic due to aft watching movie going to so called reviews @😅.. I learned better English for sure..... How fluently massnd elaborate the things, really appreciate it👍

You are the son of Masoondi 😡👿😠😠
I loved the movie 👌,I don&#39;t care about negative reviews.

Pathetic movie.

Saaho movie is a next level movie...its amazing film

Rajeev Masand: Thanks for saving 3 hours.

Sir you must remember that south films are mainly based on action and action sequence does not have any specific or realistic connection with daily life; when it is about story , I think before making the film director must have discussed it with you , we would have got some positive opinions, all over you should watch south films which have better narrative technique than your other so called better Hindi films . thanks for your illogical biased opinions

This movie is really good. Don’t listen to this guy.

Amazing film
Why every Indian talk in English do you hate your language?

These guys wants race kinda  movies.sick!!!

F*off

story not a black box is  garana not ashok he is saaho roy&#39;s son.

This review seems so fake... these Bollywood paid critics can’t tolerate the success of South Indian actors...first of all your review is so dumb like your actual brain... pls go get a brain... it’s a shame that ppl like u are Indian critics ... pls raise ur standards... stop promoting those so called dumb celeb kids... are u serious 1.5 stars??? The movie deserves 4 on 5 you dumb piece of shit...

Hello, ur last line about the parachute scene, this is a real sport, I think u should also have little knowledge abut it, I pity u man😊😊

Mr Masand and Dr Tharoor should totally have a debate competition.Who else agree with me??👇

your accent and voice looks like gay..please dont do review of films again.u don&#39;t have enough standards to review movie like these..

is he the new KRK??🤮🤮
Your review gave me a headache more than any movie could ever give. Saaho is an excellent movie. Hats off to the director. He&#39;s only 28yrs old and it&#39;s his second movie.By giving wrong reviews like this you&#39;re discouraging bold attempts like this. Try to be little more responsible and also try to have a little more open mind

when u watch the movie the second time then will u understand the brilliance of the movie....my first tym experience was same as yours

Nee mama rarei

First check why so many ppl dislike this video...bakwaas review...

Kindly Rajeev and other people(saying headache or no story), Watch the detailed explanation of Saaho @Thyview page. Then, you can change your perspective and understand about screen play movies.

It&#39;s a four start movie. U better stop reviewing movies. Saaho is a very simple story presented in a new scale. U don&#39;t understand.

How much you got

The complex screenplay for an intelligent audience. Brilliant movie. Ignore critics. Apparently, this critic lacks such intelligence and critical thinking.

What rubbish, i watched the film, it was really good, rubbish review

Bhai seedha seeda bolna wasseypur style may YE KYA BAVAASEER BANADIYE HO. 😄😄😄
Fat fellow 🐼 don&#39;t go for interviews again

Pounding headache, taken  a day to recover. You should be banned from reviewing films. They spend crores and you decide on1 St day itself, frightening people with those words.Decided to give a miss to the movie by seeing these reviews. But watched on 5 th day, the movie is neither perfect nor worse. The last 30 mins action and final twist makes up for all the negative aspects of the movie. Pounding headache!! eating your daily bread due to film industry, frightening people to go to theatres. Shame on you

Badwaas movie
Rajeev massend favoruiye movie thugs of hindustan

Aha! The script on your right...possibly much more worked on than 5 scripts of films like Saaho. What a treat to see your reviews Rajeev!

Nycc platform to show your English speaking skills

Saaho 👎👎👎👎👎😭😭😭👎👎👎👎
Flop movie saaho
He is right.

It already earned 370 cr in seven days speak whatever u want to that doesn&#39;t matter

3k like or dislike 2.5k ha ha ha
Fat guy with pepper and salt hair 😄😄😄expected review.... But people review is different

OMG ,  this shows nobody should ever listen to your review. It&#39;s great movie . Your review is horrible. Looks like paid review

Movie was good.. Your review was really boring...

Brother, you are very lucky to have touched Prabhas. Logs in Hyderabad could not be seen even from a distance.
You will have less fun, people will have your reviews and you will enjoy the same app.
Can u speek Hindi, don&#39;t forget u r indian
Bhai log isko subscribe kyun karte ho??? Apni soch aur choice se Chalo... Pls unsucribe this peope if u r a true movie lover... Kyunki yeh log bakwaas bol k Paisa Kama Rahe hai but hum log hi bewakoof banbrahe hai

Soon , he will start reviewing hard core blue filims

Looks like you did not get your biscuits from the production team.....

Tu kuda Bana ek film ...saala...MCBC
What are you saying?...What is the path of these people....Whoever watches the film will watch it....He earns money by talking nonsense on YouTube....RIP English language by you
Thanks to 1.5 rating which gave us  350+ crores gross till now and its counting goes on <a href="">#criticproof</a>

This movie is proved critic proof!!! Nothing can stop its collections!!! Please dnt compare with Race!!! 😝😝😝

Now  I got to know Rajeev is not matured by his brain instead he is matured by is stomach and using the stomach as a brain to understand the basic storyline. He is such a dum that he should join school days again or he should consult the doctor that his mind&amp;brain are working properly or not.

This fat guy with salt and pepper hair should consult a doctor 😂

I think u have not understood the movie.Person who understands will give 5/5.

this is not for fans  this is only 4 diehard fans...ok

that is banzai jump dumb idiot rajeev.. u don&#39;t know anything and calling yourself ae critic 👀👀👀👊👊shame on u

All the critics are desperate to criticize out of jealousy 😈

I wish I haven't had a headache since seeing your review🤯🤕
Shirtless to save Shraddha 😂 did u watch the movie or not

Truth hurts.  But the guy is right.

while going to the movie take your brain to the theater. don&#39;t forget at home

saaho is a mindblowing movie Let me tell you secret of The movie if you seen The climax and you understand the movie prabhas is not the son in the movie of jackie shroff he was adopted by him

You did Prabhas's chamchagiri sir very well.
The  way the movie was reviewed is completely  unsupportable and It looks like grounding the film. Can you pls tell me on which basis you gave a 1.5 star rating out of 5. That’s completely nonsense. The movie genuinely deserves more from the critics . Why are you reviewers killing the movie. It’s “NOT HEALTHY” right. If you think you given the correct rating. We “DEMAND” you to Show us the “STATISTIC BAR “on which basis u gave the 1.5 star. demonstrate all the aspects from the movie and how it deserves a such low star. It’s a good movie to watch and Thanks for <a href="">#SUJEETH</a> and <a href="">#PRABHAS</a> For giving us <a href="">#SAAHO</a>.

Hey uncle ur reviews are suitable for 90 s movie&#39;s dis is new generation movie is good

Abe chutiye...How much money can be made from Bollywood...Saale Bikao Critic...
You talk shit. Just made one 1 minute add and show .

E kojja gadiki anavasaranga interview echaniv prabhs anna
Don&#39;t whine if CNN IBN goes bankrupt in couple of years (if they are not, already). Why? Look at the person who there are stubbornly persisting with for their movie reviews. The person reviewing the cinema should be a representation  of the audience or the diaspora, the cinema going public belongs to. 2.9k likes to 2.3k dislikes. It is such a shame. @CNN-IBN, check out the likes to dislikes ratio of the top independent content creators of India and they are in the ratio of 95:5 and those guys would garner 10 times more views than your fat with salt&#39;n pepper haired blob of butter you have hired for reviewing movies. That&#39;s because they are the representatives of whatever genres they make videos on. Irrespective of this movie, Mr. Rajeev Masand never garnered good like to dislike ratios  and never will because he was never and never will be the representation of the Indian cinema going public.

Bhai... Tickets lene ke time pe apna dimg be sath leke janeka film dekhnekha nei tho aise bakre ga tu.......

what a sitting style😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

He Is saying review of story....? I think he forgot to review the movie.

Desi rabbit hole hit like
Hit like for this dasho film

Itni mast film 150 rupee in multiplex mein. Kis bhotni Waley Ko pasand Ni ayi.

Please quit reviewing if you can&#39;t review properly. Blockbuster movie🎬

I just want to see this Salt and pepper hair guy direct  a movie and review his movie.

Review is good,but the film has crossed 💯 k in three-days so better review your self

This has actually been reviewed well. <a href="">#saahomatsaho</a>. What a hell lot of crap and a waste of time and money.

If u are questioning why prabhas jumped from Clif  then u may as well ask why Tom cruise climb those Clif without rope in Mission impossible??

Que:Why every Bollywood critics are giving negative review to Saaho ??? Ans: they didn&#39;t understand the plot! It Needs some thinking to understand it n these lazy asses have no Brain to think!!!

U don&#39;t have brain to understand the movie. In ur reviews, dislikes are more than likes why u giving reviews than🖕

This band is completely mad here🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Big hug for those who is supporting prabhas ♥

bhai ti rehne de fat guy with salt and pepper hair tum jinta bata rahe ho vaise tho bilkul nahi hai you need some mind to get whats going on in the movie ! and clearly you don&#39;t have one, no wonder why you are hated more!

sir with respect the bear body scene where hero fly off from a cliff is used to convey that hero has not all of a sudden learned to fly that jet in the coming action sequence Baby i won&#39;t you tell me song has conveyed many bollywood 30mins movie scene in a single go!

This man should work in call center ,nonsense critics things they know everything about movies .

Not surprised at all...

golu what you think about the box officer collections?

the only saving grace is you are just another head who do not understand screenplay action movies, so disappointed in you.

Guys believe me I saw the movie and it was thrilling and exciting enough. The hardwork and the deliverance was fantastic. Please go watch the movie and don&#39;t be influenced by such inappropriate reviews .

You have not admired atleast the braveness of the makers. Pointing to make negative of the film. Lost the respect on you Rajeev sir. Anyway movie is talking with it&#39;s collections.

Please stop Reviewing movies Sir. You&#39;re not a honest reviewer. I watched Saaho after watching your review.....never got headache, never got  irritated. It deserves atleast 3 stars out of 5. May be you are not matured enough to understand Saaho story. Will  watch Saaho again. I love the movie.Last but not least: I appreciate your usage of English words.

Sir please watch this movie second time, then you will understand the master mind of director.

Just English is not sufficient. Google banzai skydiving, u&#39;ll learn why the scene is made so.

Guys I have only one question after watching this movie.<b>Spoiler Alert</b>Why Kalki (Mandira Bedi) has been attacked in Mumbai? I mean she was is Roy&#39;s gang but from starting she was supporting Devraj (Chunkey Pandey) so who tried to kill her. Cos EOD she will give that Black Box to Devraj. N if it was Roy&#39;s gang then why they will shoot Prabhas and for sure it was not Roy&#39;s gang. Cos he (Prabhas) will not kill his own gang members. Pls clarify.

Rajeev, you are very good interviewing people, not good in reviewing films, you might need to just reconsider what your saying.

<a href="">3:23</a> after this point I realized myself this is a waste of time... WT... you don&#39;t even know its a heroic shot

10 days 700 crs

I am simple guy i just go to watch Prabhas just like i use to go for Sallu bhai .

Mast english bol rela hai re bhidu..डो
I give 0 out of 5 for your rating...  Next time prepare well and come 😂😁...Please not with your school english but with the better content ....

Aapko na kabeer singh acchi lgi na super 30 So plzz u dont give review.Aur haaa khud movie bana ke dikhao ko kaisi bn ni chahiye Kuchv bolta hai

According to you, which movie is being made in the next 40-50 years?

This FaAaaaaaAaatTTT Fat Guy should be a History Teacher, Cinema BLOCKBUSTER yAAAR, dont want ur fake reviews, we have brains too we can understand.

This movie looks awful. Thanks for an honest review!

Rajiv Bappa Moriya!!! It&#39;s time to visarjan his Reviews!

Sir see this movie not south movie please .

You need presence of mind while watching the movie.Dont forget your mind at home and go to the theater and if you felt impatient but understood the last 15-30min then please watch the movie again you&#39;ll love it but those who didn&#39;t get anything in first time stay away from movie it&#39;s not for you!.

This is the same salt and pepper fat guy??? Looks like Sandeep Reddy removed all the pepper and only salt left.

make another review after one week.... please..... you can... only when you change your words....

yay! I learnt new adjectives with each sentence. Thanks Rajeev Masand.

Better you are suitable to give reviews for serials

Oh u got that points only in movie any way for ur review we will give rating 0.001/5....ha 😂😛😛😛

Common grow up and think big bloody reviews..!

If u can understand interstellar then u must have enough🧠 to understand SAAHO the full pack of action n thrills

Really man this film was a headache!!

you will never sleep
Jane brother, we don't need your review.
It&#39;s no 1 movie I have ever seen. Please ask me I will give you my review.

Worst review ever

Very nice report on this movie sir !!

stop your shit man

Salt and pepper guy.

kabir singh director described him as  , &quot;a man with salt and pepper hair!&quot;🤣

Betr u direct a movie, we will watch

You are big useless fellow..why you go for interviewing them..you should be kicked out if you go for interviewing anyone.. having  knowledge making a film how can you simply say the movie is having nothing.. it is a superb movie but only confusion effected the movie......you useless fellow never do reviews on any Indian movies..if you want go for English movies

I had just watched Saaho and I tell you that why they criticize. 1.There are lots of turn and twist, You have to very active. 2.There are lots of song. But every song came at the right place and right time. I also gives you time to just relax for few minutes and  to watch the cinematic visual .Because you can&#39;t wink your eyes in the story time because the plot is not in a one direction. You have to understand each scene very quickly. 3.The length is long. But, if they show it in 2hours then everything got mixed and we will be more confused. I prefer the situation like Infinity war ,where each section was shown differently and then they come for the last battle. 4.Lack of dialogue :Ha jyada dialoguebazi nhi kaam jyada hai.Dialoguebaazi ke liye race 3 ya padmavat dekh lena . Emotion come out through actions. Dialogue came at the right place. 5.Jacky Shroff has very small role, but role is the important aur uske marne ke baad uska role kaise lamba ho sakta tha At the end, this movie is good and you loved it if you have brain. The hunt is clear. The game is on. Bang BangDon&#39;t expect like bahubali guys. It&#39;s a suspense action movie and Prabhas had played this role with ease.

Trailer showed it was going to be shit!!!

Aa gaya salt and pepper hair joker.

My dear, after watching this stupid movie, I started having a headache.
Benchod Dictionary leke Review sunh raha hu

Bnd this news channel..... 😅😅😅 I am thinking of giving a review, who are you... 100 200 extra le le...shut up.
Comparing fast and furious and mission impossible with race franchise shows how dumb you are....race 3 is the best for you....enjoy beta u have no rite to talk about sahoo even.

Protect our film there or war won&#39;t get even 2crs in Telugu

Looks like you’re running out of breath I’m just laughing at how irritated he is..I saw the movie I loved it it has me guessing best movie ever

What&#39;s wrong with his lower half of the body? It&#39;s so out of proportion lol

I personally feel Bollywood is really  afraid of south industry.  If south movie invasion is not stop then there won&#39;t be any Bollywood 😁😁😁😁

Best thing , you can do is. When you don&#39;t like a movie or when you feel it is  just below 3 star in your opinion then just don&#39;t review it. Why do you waste your time and our time.

Grow up old man. Think like Hollywood. One hero, one heroine, and one item is your definition of movie

I got respect to him after watching this review because every point is true but love towards prabhas and also the craze that trailer creates makes  this collections

Prabhas darling is the actor

Rajeev masand Sahoo collected 292 cr in just 3 days it’s just a big slap to you and reviewers given negative reviews to kabirsinh but what happen .?

292 cr collections worlwide  for 3days reviewers it’s just a slap to you ...

Rajeev did you really understood the movie ?

This fat, salt &amp; pepper hair guy may be he doesn&#39;t change, watch movie like a audience not like critic, once a gain This big tummy failed as a critic.....movie 3days 300+ crore collected world wide....

Again fat guy with salt and pepper came...With paid review

I don&#39;t know why Bollywood critics destroying the ratings of south movie&#39;s when it is dubbed or remade in hindi, they gave negative reviews for kabir singh and we all know how much The movie collected

I don&#39;t understand why you are giving negative reviews on this movie or may be you don&#39;t have mind to understand this movie. This is the best movie with best actions, suspense, romance and everything else.

Uncle gi, don&#39;t you know that&quot;Where acting begins logic ends&quot;. Every industry accepts this even Hollywood and u r yelling u want logic, go find it in ur brain if u have one

Friend, after listening to your review, my mind has gone crazy….I want to watch the movie.
Ur detected with jealousitis virus. Plz watch the movie again or may be twice to understand. This time focus on the movie rather than what to eat during the interval

Ooh man may be you didn&#39;t have a content in your head. Or may be you didn&#39;t get the money from Saaho producers

Why the hell did he give such a bad review of the movie? I watched the movie. It was not bad.Though it was not the wonderful movie, but I can say it was a nice commercial <a href="">movie.It</a> is worth watching. Every movie has certain lacuna and this movie also has some. But it is not as bad as the way critics have given reviews.

U better stop interviewing or stop reviews...coz u aren&#39;t better in either as well and old fatty like you can&#39;t or never can understandBTW u can start acting i guess And we are expexting a lead character comic movie from u<a href="">#STARTRIGHTNOWFATTY</a>

Abe, all of you in what way have you become the father of Bollyhood.....
You are just a fan of Jonny Singh, you are a fan of Jonny Singh, watch his movies and watch his interviews, please take the news channel.
It&#39;s not as bad as he explains ..

Quack quack qwak.. qwak qwak qwack qwack qwack wak.. qqqquaaaaak qwakck qwack wack. Qwack.
Song at the end 😂

Disappointed by the film. All hopes on kgf2

THAT SYMPATHY LINE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Instead of watching the movie Ur focus was on what rating should I give ...what new words to invent...what to eat in the interval... that&#39;s why u lost the plot.

Did you watch the movie? Prabhas jumping shirtless was not to save any damsel in distress, as far as I remember.

That&#39;s a bad review...... I agree the fact that movie is not great and failed reaching expectations but it&#39;s still a good one time watch movie. Action scenes were really good for Indian audiences. You better consult a doctor and check your senses.

but this is a good moviei dont agree with u

You should have brain to watch this movie...you dont have one so dont spread this shit..the best movie i ever saw...every actors acting was awsome so was the story line...i watched it and loved it

One needs to have brain to understand saaho movie. Not a over polished English. Just watch it.If you have watch it. Go for second Time with concentration you will understand what is a screenplay movies and every seen as a linkage with other. One of the masterpiece.

Are Prabhas&#39;s abs fake in this movie.. He didn&#39;t look like he was in bahubali but he has six pack abs in one scene

Chutiye steamed mom...I feel like some wild animal was born in my embrace.
Bhudda satiya gaya sala!!! Only english. No brain..! God bless such people.

Thanks, I cleared IELTS exam!

His reviews make sense only to the students who prepare for exams so that they can learn new eng words...other than that there is no use of his review...who the hell cares about your review look at the collections which are in total contrast with your idiotic analysis

Have some lunch
Everyone must press dislike button after seeing Rajeev&#39;s review

If your rating is 1.5 out of 5, then why  collections has crossed 300+ crs on 3rd day itself. Now you must give review on the collection&#39;s. just rethink about your point of view on the movie. WORST REVIEW 👎

😂all Hindi channels telecasting Telugu movies which was dubbed in Hindi for Hindi people.its means your Hindi movies are below the 1 star rating out of <a href="">5.so</a> go and work on it don&#39;t give negitive ratings to saaho.Bollywood never made a movie like Saaho 😂

Thanks in my opinion sahoo was the worst movie I have ever seen <a href="">#Biggest</a> flop

There&#39;s no animal called black panther on planet earth.

Bollywood reviewers are crying foul bcoz it’s Telugu film... would have got 4stars for same movie if khans acted... bloody slaves

Sir one question Don&#39;t you feel shame You know krk and you are same don&#39;t know anything but review a big movie and views have been never gone above  500k 😂😂😂😂

I never thought your reviews are a spoilers and yet you only try to show the negativety in movie without any appreciation for all their hardwork. So sad on your part.

Arey betaa jadamath karr naa
Hehe 1 star for u nonsense 😅😂😂

I will give you -1.5 for this bullshit so called movie review

I think it&#39;s safe to say it&#39;s a pure waste of time for actors to give an interview to him. He is any way going to back stab them by spreading negativity.

Encourage cinema mass tollywood ur Bollywood is not One India our south Industry is Dravidian cinema and Country

The Movie name itself is representing it&#39;s result in Telugu

Hi guys ! This movei  it is not about story/reveiw...it&#39;s all about full excitement movei.. watch it in theatre .. awesome movei .. Hollywood shaken..😉

If you want  reality and logic watch documentary films...

Rajeev you are ridiculous How much you get paid for giving negative reviewIt’s a super duper hit movieGo and watchDon’t listen to his shit

Worst review by a psycho fellow

My review to your review video Rajeev : Better you consult a doctor. Film is good . Don&#39;t talk rubbish as always you do. You are nothing but a steamed momo.Try to review why is it good And bad , don&#39;t criticize. Your review dont matter at all.

Now even this idiot didn&#39;t get the movie 😆😆Just go out to theatres and check it how audience are encouraging for this movie ultimately I&#39;m telling you.. you wil not get a director like  sujeeth who dare to shoot an action film for his 2nd movie itself probably he is best of best

Nik movie chudam radhuu nii niku endhukunaa raa pukaaa ..
Who the hell are you man?..Are you the producer of the film..not right??

i dont care about your review sir,i came here for new words

Better than thugs of hindustan.cant u even praise action scenes and grandeur in songs.

Being a amateur movie watcher...I think I have understood the movie more than what you have understood sir...I request you to pour your doubts regarding the movie and I will try to clear it for u

For all those who liked this movie,the explanation is really simple,you all got  some shitty taste in movies .It&#39;s because of audience like this that India still thrives making all kinds of dumbass movies like this which lacks logic ,fun and and above all common sense

Fantastically put sir !!

Your review is too headache and not the movie, movie is excellent.

This fat Lal always comes to interview before movie release n gives negative reviews for south movies ...he should also be in the list of sahoo villans ..👋

Fat gay with salt and pepper hair is back with his useless review

Saaho sujeeth and crew!! I delayed watching this film after reading the critic reviews but my daughter pushed me to watch the film today, kind of mixed feelings happy to not have missed the film and sad the way the reviewers are judging a film and giving the final verdict. It is a good film with it&#39;s own strengths and weaknesses. I liked the script, dialogues, execution and music. The actors did their job well and all the characters are well etched and closed well. For me the minuses come in the action part in terms of length and cogency of few acts even though we see it as a commercial film.Sujeeth did a credible job in giving a laid back type gripping action thriller in a stylish manner. All the emotional scenes were conceived so well. Thoroughly enjoyed the film, three cheers to the film crew.

Producers did not give you money🤣
Despite negative reviews Saaho rules the Box office..💪🇮🇳350+crores &amp; counting in just 5 days..💪🇮🇳👍New Super 🌟 of Bollywood..👍
Thanks Rajeev the small... belly.... white pepper guy... The moment you give worst review the film earns more.... this is happening second time in barely recent times. Keep up the good work for betterment of the film industry....

He don&#39;t have maturity if he has that he knows that how is the movie he is too old

There is something called &quot;Rajamouli Curse&#39;.  In Tollywood, it is proved (till now) that any Hero acted in Rajamouli&#39;s direction, then the Hero&#39;s next movie with any other director is a sure flop.

Hello Rajeev panda 🐼 your size increasing day by day Buy a book how to review a movie 😂😂

Sir just write a good script for Mr. Prabhas of what do you expect

Guys i just reported as misleading hehe.

dude @RajeevMasand watching this movie now, this movie is better than any karan johar and Farah Khan shit movie with big cast. I am loving the action and the upside down of the story part happening after interval. Sorry @rajeevmasand thought somewhere you were neat, now I m gonna avoid your contents.

Maha...******......... movie

Oh man, that Jump experience before Bad boy song indirectly helps him to save Shraddha Kapoor at the end

Fatty...Salt and pepper

SAAHO is mind blowing muv.What an excellent suspense thriller and superb action muv. Don&#39;t blv in these bakwass reviews . Everyone Go and watch the muv.

stop your nonsense.did you ever dare to give a revieq for  hollywood  screenplay film.?

people have different opinions but what he said make sense. I watched this movie and its just a headache .story is at fault and I dont think Rs 300 Crores is justified.

The scene where saho saves the heroine with a jet costume is pathetic. But overall  I actually loved the film.

U looking silly

He reviewed Kabir singh negative 400 crores, now sahoo , already collected 270 crores world wide in 4 days, my genuine review songs should not be there , shradha love bgm when Prabhas meet so annoying, first 90 minutes actually there is story but missing logics n screenplay, but last 90 minutes worthable high octane action.

I agree needs some worth director to handle 350 Cr

U just dont review the film but u keep a paper in front of u filled with lots and lots of vocabulary but one thing u forget s while watching film you gotta apply some brain ungortunately which u dont have .sorry to say but thats the truth

I&#39;ve seen this movie in IMAX 3D Melbourne and would&#39;ve given only half star. 3D me VFX and CG bakwas laga. I was literally having headache as i came out after watching it. Rajeev sir ne toh phir bhi dil khol k star diye hain.

To give review only English is required...it is also necessary to understand the movie.
Sandeep looks like a bad version of Emraan HashmiSo chill before calling him salt and pepper.

I agree with you Sir

all the haters of saaho for hobbs and shaw - &quot;woww hobbs and shaw is wonderful action movie...so they can take cenimatic liberty its awesome hollywood rocks&quot;for saaho - bloody shit movie dont have story ,(they want story in screenplay movies if it is an indain movie) no physics nothing&quot;indian audience hypocrisy fucks

video games has more interesting and sensible story lines sir even better then hollywood standards and 100x better then bollywood standards, take examples of assasin creed franchise or mass effect

They thought they could sell anything in the name of the lead actor.

Who cares....I liked it...and we liked it Mr RAJEEV

1.5 rated movies collected 204 crores in 2 days if you doesn&#39;t  know how to review a film just go to home and sleep  dont spread negative talk..

Take Rest., Critic expired in you. You didn&#39;t see any good in this film? How sad.

Gentle Men, film lovers watch again to get the hold on the head ache and understand the movie again. So, it pulls the movie Lovers(not the reviewers) to theaters...It would be ok and collects the money ....

review toh english me deta ha, hindi movie khaag pasand aayegi teko😂I suggest you to be an IELTS Teacher Salt &amp; Pepper hair guy!

sahoo
its a good movie. we should encourage this type movie, so in future more movies with better standard will release

Dear CNN why don&#39;t u throw this fat guy out... Movie is really  entertaining and u guys have appointed a nonsensical guy for reviewing movies... same words  he used for Kabir Singh as well..but it did 270cr business..

Dear fatty pumpkin fellow..... nobody is taking your review genuinely,  better you stop giving ratings on movies... Half baked fellow🐻🐻

Sir, I&#39;m looking to go abroad. Please start IELTS training institution. 😂🤑You took very nice interview with sahoo, but now the same way you are letting them down with this review. Don&#39;t try to share your opinion as a public review🖕

i give 0.0001 i would better watch race 3

Wasted Movie

Sahoo....Definitely not for a serial lovers

This  reviewer not understand movie properly

your rating 1.5/5?? -----sorry, you have gone wrong on this one, which you must have realized after the verdict given by the audience. Collections --4.5/5. Next time try to do a good job. All the best!

Bekar review... I think pyse nai diye shad...chutiye

Fat Uncle I think u r brain is not workingDue to heavy fat in your body So try 2 burn u r fat. Otherwise it will be difficult for u r brain 2 understand the logic + screenplay base movies ND also the story line.Motu Tera kada b hota ya nhi 😂😂😂😂😂

Let&#39;s see you say the same thing for Salman movies!

He does everything, except review!

Why it&#39;s only 480 p ??

Your are here to give review. For not revealing story...

Bhai bakery k item Kam khaaaa , mar jayega sale ..phugge
I don&#39;t think he even watched the movie properly. <a href="">3:20</a>:  He jumps into the open sky, shirtless to rescue his damsel.    Umm, where was this scene again? Where the hero jumps <b>shirtless without anything</b> into the open sky to rescue his damsel. Someone answer I&#39;ll wait... Don&#39;t mention the jetpack scene, the critic says shirtless and without anything.

Worst movie ever! For once, I agree with Rajiv. I ended up with a migraine after watching this senseless, useless, cartoonish hogwash of a movie! Total nonsense! No script whatsoever! Anything goes! Hero throws his parachute and then jumps shirtless to catch it in mid-air just for fun. The hero and heroine run through a rainfall of bullets from machine guns without a scratch, jetmen flying in jetsuits to catch criminals,...there&#39;s just no limit to the director&#39;s stupidity. My rating &quot;0&quot; star for this headache of a movie. Race 3 made more sense than this movie!

I just watched yesterday. Not as Bahubali I-II. But It was nice. Songs, visual effect and action is awesome...Aur kya chahiye?  :D

Just go through his reviews playlist...and you will pass TOEFL exam.

Who else skip the review everytime to the end just to see how much star rating Rajeev Masand gave to the movie ? 😂🤘

I watched it !!! very impressive !!

bhakwaas
But I like it movie

thanks for english class

This fat- guy with salt and pepper hair will never change 😂

Rajeev Uncle, Mr.60 year old Virgin! Why  are you still reviewing movies?

What about shraddha... If it was alia you would have complemented her like crazy

End of the people decide the movie fate... SAAHO is unstoppable 👏👏👏

Prabhas and <a href="">#Saaho</a> team kicked off all your critics with the phenomenol collection..... F*** off all paid critics..... Audience are supporting film in a huge way....

This is the craziest movie i have ever seen till date. Actor should have guts to take such a film after the massive success of Bahubali Sequence. This is an experiment which director Sujeeth and Prabhas has done rather than going with regular remakes( ie,., starting from Garam Masala to KICK2) which few film stars make. The concept is fresh which you haven&#39;t seen on Indian Cinema Screen and will change the future of Indian Cinema.If anyone thinks GODFATHER and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION are the best movies which created stroms in the Hollywood history. Then SAAHO is the same kind of movie in Indian film Industry.About Prabhas:He is a risk taker and has done a fantastic job in the film. He has taken his acting to the next level with fresh look. He is a GEM of INDIAN CINEMA- His screen presence makes film awesome.About SK:She has done a great job and without her the film would be no where. If anyone think her character is not required in the movie or she not not done justice to the role. Go and watch Dhoom series and compare with the roles played by Esha, Bipsha, Aishwarya and Kat. SK character has much elevation when compared to the other previous ones.About UV:The one and only production house which has steel balls to go with such a risk taking concept.UV gave great movie to India.Not sure if they can earn profits because of the negative reviews spread by some film critics can be called as brokers. About Sujeeth:He is an amazing director, story and screenplay for this film is amazing. It was a unique story on the indian cinema. He created NEW GODFATHER story on indian cinema. He direction skills are better than Rajmouli. Rajmouli can make the film look rich with existing concept but can not invent new concept. Awesome BGMAbout Neil:He is a great actor and has done justice to the character. His character as under cover cop is amazing and he is main guy who will reveal the story.About Vijay:What an acting, His entry in the film will be mind blowing. Without his character the film has no suspense and thrill. His character is pivotal. I have become his fan after watching the movie.About Villans:Director has selected the best villans from india and they have done the justice. All these great actors presence has made the film richer and greater. All has done the great job starting from Chunky Pandey to  Lal.Awaiting for SAAHO sequence.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD THINK OTHER PEOPLE OPINION&#39;s ARE GREATER THAN THEIR OWN- SORRY FOR THEM AND DO NOT REGRET LATER.

Bakwaas movie saaho and disgusting movie saaho and time waste money waste 👎👎👎

Collections are high

U waste fellow u make one movie then we will make an interview on that

You fat idiot first try to fit in that sofa

This is called over expected movie review. Just see the movie as u know it&#39;s flop you will impress definitely. If you listen spoilers don&#39;t watch the movie just watch the serials.

Giving 1.5/5 shows your ignorance. I give 5/5 for your ignorance and biasedness.

I love Saaho movie super
I saw the movie. Went with huge expectations . Really really disappointed. Masand is right...exhausting is the word .

See the movie is not that great. First half is very slow &amp; boring. But not as worst as u tell!!~~

Rajeev don&#39;t call yourself a journalist

I had to agree with this guy

Go and watch# Tom and Jerry#...it suits to you

This is a very useless review I cant believe on it.

Abe Salt and pepper hair wale pagal kya chutiyapa bakwas kar raha hai haiSale movie to blockbuster hai बौकरड़ोड़ौपाई है मजाया आआ देख कर 👍👍Awesome गोड़ोक
High intelegence movie... I am sure your brain doesn&#39;t hve such intelegence dude... Rajeev watch it properly instead of concentrating on ur shows...

If this movie is made in hollywood and it stars vin diesel, dawayen johansson, under Marvel studios and under disney production company and directed by christopher nolan then he give 4 1/2 stars movie.

Rajeev Masand english is beyond science, arts and literature 😂

Flop movie

Chudhiya

Bakwas movie thi Action scenes xod kar Poor story, Screenplay, songs sab bakwas thi who are praising this movie have no idea how movie should be they all are fan of movies like Race3, dhoom3 etc.

Dammn...... I found Sahoo more interesting from your review.....

Come on you fat cunts. First reduce your obesity.
U keep on spreading negativity... Audience are still going to theatres...One old fat english speaking guy can&#39;t decide a film&#39;s fateOnly audience  will

Salt and pepper Review

Its easy to understand sahoo movie than this fat guy&#39;s review😂

Don&#39;t listen to negative reviews.   Movie is awesome. People are paid to give negative reviews.

Bloody man.......👎👎
Rajiv Masand reviews were better to ignore. Kabir Singh then now Sahoo. Even you didn&#39;t understand as many normal people understood this mve. So, what is use of put rating. Sahoo was well matured film. Even Intestaller and Prestige also not understood at 1St, That not mean they not good. The way Director handled the Script awesome. Pre interval, Pre climax and climax are awesome if you more focus other then like Love and romance movies. The Banging scene is Climax. The way Director handled screen play 4 ways to bang target the was boom Saaahoooo. Don&#39;t spread negetivity simply check review and ignore movie as template bad.

I really enjoying the move

4/5

Salt and Pepper fatso get a life

I am surprised ur a critic. I think ur better as an english lecturer rather than being a critic.  U r on the wrong side.

Dude with your english you should be providing tutions for CAT Exams

Sale boiled momo

Abbey sale masand....kuch bhi apni pasand..... Jab prabhas se interview kiya tab to thik tha....paisa nehi mila kiya

For me it’s just a<a href="">4:18</a> mins ki English ki classI already know the movie is shit 💩

In case anyone is curious, <a href="">2:19</a> MacGuffin is any element, character or a scene that is crucial to the plot of the story.

Always voice whatever you feel. These brainless fanboys will try to bring down any one who speaks the truth. I have always been here for your opinion and always will be.

Yeh bhosidiwala pacha nh pa rahe south actor itna famous ho Gaya hai...
Poori tehzeeb aur adaab se jizzati karna karna aapse aapse bhi sakte hain… घोटा तसागा Awesome!
Prabhas deserves our sympathy for accepting this movie lol.....

Bhai its movie not like routine

Meeting less review

Fat guy with salt and pepper hair

R m= garbage

Buk buk buk buk buk buk buk
Orgin english people will also  face difficulty to underdtand english.. which he spk.

Sandeep vanga is correct for you
Movie for public not for stupid people like you and CNN is Worst channel we know that

Within 3 days this film has grossed over 200 crores still butt hearts giving negative reviews

.in the Nice movie block buster  movie

Just came after watching this film it has Hollywood level actions

I love to read comments more than his review

You need a different mentality to understand what it was meant to beAnd what it is Dont just go roasting  a movieBecause of some mistakesYou go try to make a movie of this sortSaaho is a action thrillerWhich didnt completely fulfilled it potential but stillIt isnt the worst movie ever like you are describingYou need a better sense of action thriller movies to understand its confusing twists😒Gd luck

For this epic review I&#39;m gonna rate you now 0.0000 out of ZERO with lots of tatti 💩💩💩.Thanks uncle for showing ur disaster mind. I&#39;ve a suggestion for u don&#39;t give so much pain to ur little old brain and mouth. Saaho blockbuster💥💥Love you prabhas ❤❤

I don&#39;t even give 0.5/5 for your review
Dude never got headache felt a bit slogging how you guys give such low review not appreciating twists turns suspense goosebumps... you don’t have any rights to reveal story like dis on first weekend

In my review, watch the review of your choice, brother, watch the movie yourself, which movie will you like?
Hey Fatty....first try to be fit....And then talk about the fit , perfect , awesome and great movie - SAAHO.... Jai Saaho....guys everyone please don&#39;t believe any review....u first go watch the movie... u will definitely love the movie for sure...

Hey salt and  pepper hair boy came😂

ok, just one thing id like to point out, <a href="">3:56</a> if you really think video games dont have emotional depth and cant tell beautiful stories, play a few like The last of us, God of war, Yakuza, and others some games have more endearing plots than many movies, so id say u need to educate urself first, but as far as the review i cudnt agree more!

It's bad for us
Here comes fat guy with salt and pepper hair...

Is he reviewing or narrating a chapter of Flamingo?
Already become blockbuster

What all this fools say about movie, all is bull shit the movie is next level and its has to be watched for its technical values and performanceAnd we will see how much war will be different from saaho

Only maar daad,boring picture, no nice song ,no good story , no romance story

Guys, please watch this movie with consentration, its a parallel Screenplay movie, if you watch this movie carefully u definitely love it...I understand the movie, after I watched it 2 time...Overall its was excellent movie

Like for chalta phirta dictionary
See boss ! Your review got 40% dislikes.....STUPID be careful

For people like us who are scratching heads. We searched MacGuffin for you: noun: MacGuffinan object or device in a movie or a book that serves merely as a trigger for the plot. You are welcome.

Poda pappu... Daallwala
He not suitable for this ...🤣funny guy

Mr Rajeev thought you had a brain

Worth watching movie👍

<a href="">

Salman, Shahrukh,Amir not touch South but Prabhas North n South all India touched when bollywood movies realese You give all over India collection but When South India movies realese you give only hindi collection shame on you

U dont deserve to do review
I Wish Katappa Killed Saaho instead of Bahubali

I loved that movie a lot.... Don&#39;t even want to compare with Baahubali... It&#39;s the  most silly thing to do.....too much hardwork shows.... Prabhas acted so naturally.... I expected Jackie Shroff and TINU ANAND&#39;S role here... Cause they are superb actors accordingly..... But Prabhas n the action scenes are like paisa vasul!!!! 1st of all audiences should be ready mentally to accept this type of movie... They are expecting like BAAHUBALI....hilarious....understand the type of movie at first..... They hv to be educated subjectually to understand this movie.... But yeah.... Editing could be more furnished that I must say, it could be. It should be, Which sometimes made the movie a bit slower and boring..... I din&#39;t like the songs at all.... Psycho Saiyaan was more or less bearable.... Others were not bearable at all...rather I can say those songs were not necessary... They could release the songs on YouTube to make the business instead of using it in movie. People can praise Hollywood but not our industry.... They can see anything dumb in Hollywood but not here.... In future noone would dare to make this type of movies if they get such demotivating reviews... Pathetic😕Overall.... I loved that movie I want to watch it again n again for Prabhas only❤️, his dedication omg!!!! anything for darling😍😘

Wasted Movie

Gundu maama Rajeev, movie is not that bad as you said.

Movie was good

What the hell ur telling......... ..

fayda kya hai uncle  apki english to smjh ni aati

Just learned 100 new english words. Done for the day!!

Nice movie yaar
Movie is good.. why you spread negative review.. better to unsubscribe you.. speaking new words in English is not enough to describe a good movie.. learn to respect good movies..

For your review you will justify yourself , just goto dressing table mirror take of your shirt , look at yourself in the mirror give the review about yourself and Prabhas honest buddy you will get the answer .

Good honest review
You have family pack you can’t do that much stunts in real life ,can you run 50 meters without stopping 5 seconds, you can’t because you are an easy money maker, you don’t need so hard work, you just do fucking comments and reviews on their lives, but they did their best , although it’s a movie , it’s an 40% goes to imagination, so you can’t give your fucking review on it .

Movie worst
Guys, I have seen movie on first day and first show. It was a Super action thriller movie. Enjoyed thoroughly. It’s nice movie if u like action thriller. But surprised to see this -ve reviews all of a sudden. Songs are classic and u will enjoy in the IMAX theatres. it’s Romantic action thriller Movie.. Go and watch it!!

Useless review.. dumb fellows are not able to understand the twists ..

u can explain in nice way..u are no longer fit for right critic.. Do u have logics in other movies.. u r old thugs and never understand action thrillers bcs brains occupied with emotional movies with sentiments.

Salt pepper guy playing with words.

Report this video

Waste of time

Blockbuster saaho...no need of review

That’s why his views aren’t much aggressive guy

I only came here to read comments

He just sits on the chair and babbles.
Feeling bad for Prabhas. Just watched the movie, it&#39;s not unwatchable but it&#39;ll give you a minor headache for sure. Only saving grace in the movie is Prabhas.

<a href="">#Saaho</a>



A one time <a href="">#MustWatch</a>



Surprised with all the negative reviews floating around. Things that stand out for me as a lover of <a href="">#TeluguCinema</a>...



a. Lack of <a href="">#VulgarContent</a>. Its a departure from the two heroine, <a href="">#BellyButton</a> showing dresses dancing around macho <a href="">#TeluguHero</a>



b. <a href="">#BlinkAndMiss</a> screenplay. Too fast screenplay and lot of interplay between characters which are not developed to the full extent.



c. <a href="">#WorldClass</a> <a href="">#ActionScenes</a> - Could have curtailed few action scenes and given more space for the story.

1.5 star....hahahahaha

Movie is not that bad, we can watch it once.

The movie is not as bad as you have told. . It is lengthy but better than lame Krish series. The movie has taken Indian cinema to the next level. It takes certain level of brilliance and guts to make such an attempt. The film is multi-layered with Loads of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of the seat. Visuals and sets are spectacular and are a treat to the eyes. Stunts are one of the best in the industry seen. Every character had a role to play in the film. The director is super talented to have pulled off a project of this scale. It&#39;s a tough script and Prabhas is simply amazing.

Maguffen?What?What is that particular word?

See the collections  u idiot

Bollywood is always.... Believes only in romantic movies... That&#39;s quite obvious... They never accept any new genre... Unless...if the film is hit.. You know. Prabhas  has tried to introduce a new culture in Indian cinema... To introduce.. a screen play based cinema. If you are not aware of Screenplay based cinema.. Before giving a comment.. Please watch screenplay based movies

Here  u gave rating for saaho movie now  I am going to give rating on ur overall review about saaho what u understand after watching saaho is -4.9/5 for ur great analysis Guys don&#39;t stick thiz all low ratings on 1st 2 days after realising a famous person movies we saw on bahubali 2 n I am sure that thiz movie blasts d box office

Better go and open a tutorial for English classes for the people who are preparing for GRE and IELTS so that they score good number but please don&#39;t review movies which is out of your knowledge.

pretty much title says even the makers did not know what they were doing.

Not bol na chutiay
Tension was visible on my face when there was a wrong review...Bc
If u want nice score in pte or ielts just use his words u will get 7/10😜

Correct review

Beja Fry
Mota masand Na kare pasand Sirf kare hamesha english mein chu cha Lekin public dekhati hein essey thenga

His review is good for students preparing for banking exams

Watch in 2x speed to enjoy review

This guy takes tuition from Shashi Tharoor 😁😁😁

RIP Rajeev masand reviews.i stopped it from Kabir Singh, now that he is in Mars.

U only like people films from karan johar...ranveer Singh...etc etc

205 crores in 2 days ...! How many times u give this kind of loser review boss ji ... ? First kabir singh , now saaho.. I guess, sujeeth should give an interview to Film companion and give you a different name this time around like Sandeep Reddy

Old uncle go and watch tv serials

What a English 😰😰😰

Shut up and encourage

Salt and pepper guy 😂😂

critics key baam pe laat
U proved that u r a paid critic Mr Masand.. will no more watch ur interviews nor ur reviews.

Emotional depth of a video game? Has he not heard about the latest god of war? Or about last of us? Or BioShock Infiniti? These games blow most A grade Hollywood movies out of the water in terms of story and character development. Expected Rajeev Masand to be better

Big BUDGET! Bad Performances! Worst DIRECTION! Unnecessary Songs! Unbearable Stretched Action sequences! CRAP FILM! Prabhas be careful while choosing next Script. It&#39;s the Script first not the Budget. Such a big opportunity has been wasted on this Crap for two years.

All fake reviews, People are watching still. Coz it&#39;s prabas movie. India&#39;s big star

Are you mad Rajeev Masand
Salt n pepper guy 😂
I only came here to dislike each and every video of Ms.salt &amp; pepper.😂😁

Perfect review

Uncle have you put something in your mouth...

Movie really super duper hit, all reviews r paid by some bollywood producer

Boring movie only Prabhas rocked with his looks and that baritone voice. It was good that original voice of prabhas is used as if they dubbed it then it wouldn&#39;t made the same impact. His voice is like the Amitabh Bacchan&#39;s in his prime.

What I don&#39;t understand is.. Why do Critiques exist?? What&#39;s the point behind criticing a movie ? How contributory are these Critiques to Movie or to audience? Seriously, If people like a movie, they would watch it. If not, they won&#39;t. Worst case, audience would lose rheir hard earned money. But it&#39;s not like every single movie is Biryani to impress every section of audience right? I think the trailer gives us a basic outline of the movie, seasoned with elements that could   possibly prompt curiosity in audience, good enough to rush them to theatres. But ultimately it&#39;s upto the audience to decipher if or not he/she has to go watch the movie in theatres.Long story short: Movie can&#39;t guarantee you if or not it could entertain you to fullest . So, it&#39;s no more than a lottery ticket .. If you&#39;re lucky, you may be served with best dish.. if you&#39;re not, you know the result. You could just express if or not you liked it and why. But you can&#39;t complain n bawl as if the Producers had all your properties on Mortgage ,made you bankrupt and ruined your life for worse!  Again, Perceptions vary. No two audience need to have same POV when it comes to analyzing things in general. So, it&#39;s ultimately the audience&#39; responsibility whether or not the money &quot;spent&quot; he/she on a movie is worthwhile..

Movie was awesome.

Why are there 1k dislikes on this? The movie is really very bad 😧

One critic can lie, two critics can lie, but how everyone can lie?People who find logic in Bollywood movies are praising this movie, does this movie has any logic?

Twists superb 4/5

You salt pepper hair guy sandeep vanga told about people like you who are the parasites and threat to indian film Industry Bhagvan ke naam pe critic job choddena bhai

What is the word he pronounced at 2.20

You better be a English tutor rather than film critic ... Sandeep reddy Vanga gave him a right objectification of this guy ... can’t digest the telugu film  .. only English will not make film critic .. grew up your brain muscles

I have also seen it is not such a bad movie. It is an action movie.
Today, Bollywood did not even know that he was acting. look irfan khan, nawaz, manoj, pankaj tripathi. The audience that used to watch classic movies has not yet been born.
Movie is a great entertainer for whole family

Rajiv Masaand please Grow Up

You are fit to review the nagin serial that shown in the movie not the movie itself😂The movie is enjoyable don&#39;t go with reviews in mind.

I learned the word &#39;convoluted&#39; ....thank you Rajeev

Seriously! you people are worthless to be called reviewers...I don’t know there’s a thing called brain in every human which I pre-assume u don’t have! u*<b>**</b>

U forgot ostrich
frnds.. dont stay upon other comments...make ur own comment by watching it...i watched it by seeing negative review does this movie really a bad movie...?  no ..it is a fantastic movie...nothing less than hollywood movie...action is good ..twists are are very good...climax is the highlight...dont listen story of this movie from any body...if u do...u wont enjoy the movie

False review. Movie is far good then what your aspect after watching the trailer.

Look who&#39;s taking .. salt and pepper guy😂😂😂😂

seriously.........except action......every dialogue prabhas says in the movie is what he did and what  he is going to do in every scene.......if you don&#39;t get the movie god bless you........it is a simple story told in a different way........if you watch the movie second time again you will see how saaho is plotting a plan to destroy devraj in every possible way....by creating himself as a thief to be caught........every scene makes sense if you know what you are watching and how u r watching........

CNN should fire him and he better be an English teacher. He is no worth to be a movie critc...what an assh*le!

See the movie with your eyes, not his.

Your useless review won&#39;t effect anything.... understand cinematography and understand the screens play and action sequence. I think you would expected a love story movie out of this sahoo I think u might have disappointed may be that is reason u gone mad giving useless reviews.

best movie of year

I have watched the film it was outstanding screenplay Sahoo is upgrade screenplay version for indian films Need a brain to understand this kind of films go and watch again mr .Rajeev Film perfectly made For kind a information Sahoo is not a bahubali to understand easily Bahubali is a  periodic, mythology film And sahoo technical , intelligent film

Very nice Movie👌👌👌 5 star for Movie... 1 star for your Review.
i am going to review cnn-18 news channel 1 star. one more who are u to rate dear. its people to decide. 2 year for sahoo and 3 hour to review. very bad.

Sir serf 1 and a half... No sir itni buri nhi hai...  I give 3 out of 5 and only for prabhash..... He was superb

He is totally  fake person  , please  ignore  him completely  ,

Come on, at least 2 😜

lol....these buffalows love bleday karan johar movies....i  understand to enjoy this movie they should have  brains unfortunetly uwhich u dont have...

Uncle 🧐... I&#39;ll reply after watching this film... 👽

What is that tongue action at 3.45 ?

Worst movie ever I have seen. Don&#39;t waste your money in watching this movie. No logic nothing especially first fight😂😂😂😂

This is not a REVIEW at all....he doesn&#39;t know anything about the film making. All he knows is a Fluent ENGLISH. He never speak about the crafts of the film. He can&#39;t make even a small 2-3 minutes of shortfilm with amazing quality. In my opinion these critics should have a qualification to become a critic in film industries. They must direct at least 20 films in the past or they should have been a part of one of the 24 crafts of the film. Then we can understand that they are GENUINE reviewers/critics. Just because you know fluent ENGLISH, you can&#39;t be a critic or reviewer. Get some basics of the FILM MAKING. Until then, stop reviewing the films.

Very true words, brother….how are you?
Torture to another level, full of out of work (non) actors. In short.

Agree with your review i just wasted my 350 Rs 😢😢

Worst review ever

This review leaves you with pounding headache 🤯 Ridiculously silly review.

movie is awesome

Arey sir that jump is called base jumping without parachute..it is a real stundt but they managed with great VFX....first Google it what is base jumping ....not only putting Google translator in u r mouth know the meaning of that scenes....

Quote &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a party pooper&quot; well enough of Internet for today you are exactly a Pooper

Iron leg of Shraddha continues....

Sir Movie is good,Already Prabhas and team had informed in all media interactions that it doesn&#39;t have any new story , it&#39;s about screenplay and twists , action .But the critics are too quick to criticize on the day of release.But still the same critics who got YouTube views with Prabhas interviews are now giving negative reviews.

super review. appropriate.
Great Rating 1.5/5 of <a href="">#Sahoo</a>

Learnt 12 to 13 new words 😅😅thank u so much sir😊😊

Its salt paper right Hyper toxic Massacres right🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why this biased jackass is doing South Indian movie review?

Movie super the worst reviews

He had given 1star to Tashkent file and movie was superb so dnt consider such review

If this would be a hollywood movie every wld have been extremely praising the action, thrilling, twists,   bgm, the songs location and of course the whole movie..!!!

Hope the producer didnt commit suicide

Worst fellows .. movie is excellent

Glad Masand called out the shit movie out on its BS!

Hey Salt and pepper ... once again bad review .... and I think come to me, I will teach you , how to watch screen play based movies ..... u deserve this

Why these critics can&#39;t talk normal English.  Do they think they are more important than the film crew and all the technicians.

Better you  make movie we will review it

I watched movie even after listening their poor reviews and trust me.... Movie is very nice and you will enjoy it.... Poor critics fcuk off

He doesn&#39;t understand shit, Guys don&#39;t believe all these negative reviews, I went to the theatre thinking movie is a failure but when I watched the film, I was awestruck !!. I feel all these guys are paid coz they are trying to decrease its collections (but we knew now that it already beat endgame and ThugsOH on its first day 68cr). Many people didn&#39;t understand the story coz of twists but watch carefully , you&#39;ll understand the story and its beauty. Btw felt like watching a Hollywood movie... Look, Because of low collections Directors and producers will back off and won&#39;t make these type of movies again and we will get only desi Pyar movies later. So plz watch the film, IT&#39;S WORTH IT, and don&#39;t believe negative reviews.

Why don&#39;t you guys report his video

This pumpkin fellow should talk about daily serials bcoz he can&#39;t understand more than that

How dare you insult video games :)

Our indian industry is challenging Hollywood industry some people like this guy became slaves to those Hollywood people and talking in this way.this is prabhas&#39;s 19th film but directors 2nd film.sahoo is a director&#39;s movie my rating is 3.5 of 5.

Thanks !! Saved some money

This movie sucks so much, I felt like I puked thrice on the screen while watching it.

It&#39;s a good entertainment movie.Thanks to all the negative <a href="">reviews.It</a> became pleasant surprise during watching this movie.

U critics will just run after khans and the likes. Just stay home and save ur time next time.Wake up and see the numbers . Just stop reviewing and start some exercise

Hindi main baat kar re kuch samajta nahi
Chunky was a good villain

Much better than Race III

Oh Common Rajeev this movie has more BOLLYWOOD stars than any of the recent Big Budget movies and still giving 1.5 Stars do you mean Shradda Kapoor, Neil Nithin, Jackie Daada,Tinu Aband,Mandira Bedi they are all Dumb???no wonder you made your people Idiot like you NoBrain Expert😆😆😆😆😆

<a href="">3:30</a> jump shirtless to save is damsel.. damn.. he giving review without watching movie it self🤦🏻‍♂️... he jump after throwing parachute and trying catch it... as he celebrating his success.....  don’t give this kind of shitty reviews.. aren’t you the one who been pricing Hollywood action movies.. when in India they try it now you want all kunkum Bagya drama and all in action movie rather than having action.... sabaaaash... Jai Indian movie critics

It is super duper hit movie

Speak in Hindi. Baigan ki baat karre
Movie hit or flop, i dont care, want to watch prabhas for <a href="">2:30</a> hrs after a long time

I don&#39;t know critics are reviewing movie or just criticizing it.... stupid fellow....if you had problem with the story just explain that ,how it is a problem....by using tough vocab words and criticizing it can&#39;t make u true....u you don&#39;t have good things to say ...then just appreciate the effort and dedication the actors and directors had put into it..... movie banane walle aapse jydaa hi kabil honge.....jinhone fans pr trust kia ki they will get to see something new..........Kch critics to e v bol re h ki song gaalat jegeh placed h....i Don&#39;t know inke aankh me kon sa lens lga hua h.....mjhe to sare song perfect lge... except psycho saiyannn....Kch din baad e v bolenge ki song hi ni hona chahiye.....I have always been taught that a good decision maker is one who sees both good and bad side... And appreciate the good side....and understand what is bad....I don&#39;t think aise ratti bhar v quality kisi v critic review me mjhe dekhne mille h avi tk....Inhe lg ra h jinhone movie banaya wo the bewakuff ar e h....ISRO k chairman....BRAINLESS PEOPLE 😑😑

If I speak in Hindi then I will be shamed for speaking English.😡😡
Omg why everyone are giving wrong information...it&#39;s made of 150c only, 350 was a fucking fake news.. it&#39;s a rumour...

This old man is suffering from boiling frog syndrome,exasperating farrago.hahaha, I only came here to see Sashi taroor part 2 new english words jugglery.a person who cannot record his own video in HD is giving lecture Rajeev Mahasaandha hahah must watch your cahnnels camera and dorection before commeinting on any movie.buddy you need a serious  treatment,

I think Rajvee should migrate to the US

For example, Salman movie tubelight and SRK’s dwarf movie Zero.  I’m still recovering from that trauma.  Saaho is way way better movie as far as entertainment is concerned.  At least it’s intelligent

It’s not that bad of a movie Rajeev, all you got to say is all negative.  I think there are many SRK and Salman films that are much worse.  Salman khan’s action movies are pointless compared to Prabhas.  Salman’s movie are not intelligent rather simply stupidly silly. Movie Plot is intelligent, but nothing we have not seen before.  But actor is hot and that’s what matters.  Prabhas is worth my money.  I would have regretted if I spent for such movie and salman was a star.

U r better sucking at all khans ballls, and do u really know how to watch the movie?

SAHOO ONE LINE REVIEWA long stretched THUMS UP AD😂😁😀LOL
Yee toh angreji ma hai!!

Garib log ko kuch review smjh hi nhi aya
Isa hi review tum khans ka movie pe desakthe HO kya?thel dalke bajaake chodenge.

Collections dekke iska G**d lal honewala hai.2 days baaki.Pure investment will be gone.100. Rupiya ticket was bought for 2000 rupees. Here you will wait for Bahubali 3. Suvar theri G**d.
Guys, don&#39;t follow him. Movie is great and really watchable

Such a director will cut his nose and make such movies in India ☹️☹️☹️
Aloo on a couch... Itna accha judge kar lete ho.... Ek short film to bana de...

In 3 hours movie there are quite a few scenes (3-4)which damages the movie People like you pin points them and say it not good and gives very bad ratings or reviews  I am Telugu guy and watched it in Hindi North Indians gay Standing ovation and I am from (Montreal ) Canada

We cannot judge films for logic. Films are not made for that. Logic is borinh

No Problems Rajeev we liked the movie, we just want prabhas, it&#39;s a one man show forget about slow narration and bizarre scenes, it has broken first day record of Bollywood films, and it ll be safe to collect that 350 crores and would be a winner

Every South Director is not SS Rajamouli!!

Rajeev masand... you should review “All you can eat” Buffets , not movies. It doesn’t suit your personality. you have my sympathy.

Overall movie is tatti

If u don&#39;t like movie ok , just say normal words ,y ur overreacting
Can understand your frustration. Movie  was horrible. Prabhas would have listened to narration during sleep I guess.

You have a lot of people following you...on the day of release you watch the movie and give the complete story out...Head ache ...for you might not be for every one....Stop giving it as the final judge verdict...One has tried something new..you can tell the plus and minus..But making sure no else should go and watch it through your words is ridiculous...

Chinese laughing budda Salt and pepper gay talking about a 350 cr film   .. unmovable parasite 🦠

shup up....

Yayy! more new English words and phrases! 😊😄

Baap in reviewing movies 🎥

Friends.. Its time to take out...our..  Oxford DICTIONARY.... 😂😂😂...

This guy loves to thrash movies. This isn&#39;t a great movie but it&#39;s not as bad as these ppl are making it to seem. I went to watch bcs i had no choice and it had its problems but i wasn&#39;t that bored or diassapointed (went with normal expectations). Movie should have been 30 mins shorter. 2 songs, slow-mo and some fight sequences could have been trimmed out, which would have given more grip to the screenplay. It had potential, but ended up being avg film.

You sold non-sense media... How much bribe you got fatty?

Rajeev when will you stop giving reviews?

Duckoff u morons... Before movie u all people begged him for ur interview s sir pls sir pls... Now u people are Cristising him..... Its an wonderful action movie... If u want comedy..romance better watch romantic movie..movie tag line is biggest action..so it has action... Not ur bakwas

Your reviews will have more viewers than the Sahoo movie goers

Every common people are giving review of every movie easy but no body don&#39;t know how make make a movie or at least short film

On behalf of you sir, I am taking deep breaths...

Once super star rajinikanth said if he was king of indian cinema, then super star amitabh bachchan is emperor of indian cinema. Now we have &quot;Prabhas Raju  Emperor  King  of  Indian Cinematic World&quot;.

These bastards only value Bollywood's stupid movies because they themselves are stupid.
😏

Imagine Saaho with Rajeev Masand as lead actor instead of Prabhas. Just imagine.

Try to spot his neck. You have 4 minutes 17 seconds!

Rajeev gone mad
Dear Rajeev Masand, I don&#39;t know maybe:Your prejudice, less intelligence, ignorance in other departments (vfx, action, bgm, dialogue writing) are the reasons behind your such reviews. As mere knowledge of good english doesn&#39;t make you a good reviewer.OrYou promote the bad image of a movie out of bribe.As:1.Its bcoz of reviews like this India can&#39;t produce well crafted, intelligent action film having high budgets.2. BTW the movie was smarter than actually you pretend to be.<a href="">3.You</a> talk of logic. How about the logic in the movie &#39;baahubali&#39;(i love baahubali) to which you gave 4 stars.4. Leaping shirtless was there to define his character as bad (other than that you can&#39;t see him shirtless in any action sequence).

Bollywood ki nani yaad karne sahoo ayahe...app ka bhok rahe hain kya app ko paisa diya kya i will give you....👊👊👊👊
In two days i go 3 times and this is not Bollywood  i am in Hollywood  ...sahooo rock it surely cross 1200 corod

Rajeev Masand, Sahoo did not like it. After seeing the picture, it is said that he has got divorced from his wife and will marry the same wife once again, but Kabhi will not see this picture again.
What do you know about Hindi?
Suresh kumar is the best reviewer I have ever seen since year 2000 .now he has started an YouTube channel for reviews named Hot and cool. He gives the best reviews without killing the film nor the hopes of audiences and also clear-cut review.

Terry pura English

Im giving .5 out of 10 for Rajeev&#39;s movie sense n 9.5 out of 10 for his English. U better be in English tutorials business.

But people still go and watch saaho, then what&#39;s the point in this review. Anyways movie is not that bad

Everyone's favorite... Rajeev Masand
I watched the movie its amazing..liked it will watch it again..

2hrs masti on a screen is called  cinema, other than this what you are looking for?

Piranhas fans be like When critics loved bahubali: you are great reviewer our piranhas is National starWhen critics banged sahoo:These critics are morons SAHOO is better than many Hollywood films But reality is SAHOO is just below average movie like Pawan kalyan&#39;s Sardar Gabbar singh and Mahesh babu&#39;s Spyder Coming to first day collections Agnatavasi&#39;s first collections are 40 crores in a single language but we all know it&#39;s a stupid cringe worthy movie those collections were made only because of Pawan kalyan&#39;s star power in Telugu states SAHOO collections are 100 crore in 4 languages this is also completely because of Prabhas star power national wide and he made his place in the big league of Telugu as of know he is the only hero to make such a feat with a flop movie after Pawan kalyan in Telugu prabhas fans should understand that the movie is a disaster and should respect critics and their opinion

I enjoyed the movie entirely .logic logic what the f*** .every critics are reviewing bad abt south movies cz they are in fear with it.great movie yaar.bollywood needs half century to draft the story of such movies.this is the reason why this movie is undigestible to these freaks

Movie is good you bollywood guys are suckers

Prabash is rock this movie😍😍😍

Prabhas failed .....Bollywood succeed....I expected this.....

saaho amazing movie❤❤❤
U must retire now  RIP ur reviews Ghatiya admiAisi koi indian  movie nahi bani aaj tak ,respect that ....most people loving it...with ur bloody negativity dont spoil it....

I never saw him happy, don&#39;t worry after 3 days collection will tell the story.. Status of film...

1 is enough

Whatever the script screenplay.... I can watch even worse than worse movie if it has prabhas.... And I&#39;ll watch this movie as a South movie and nit bollywood... 😍😍✌🏻✌🏻 also after watching this review I self doubt my degree on English honors 😂😂😂😂

Chuthiye this man shut up

Man I don&#39;t know why u people really exist ,criticism should be helpful to create better movie but should not kill movies .

Salman khan can sing Jana gana mana in between no where in a mindless movie called Bharat.. n nothing more can be bizarre than tht..

good movie...not too bad....Indians don&#39;t appreciate indian movie....poor review..👎👎

This film really give me headache. I had a coffee after the movie to recover.

WRONG review and bad review,saaho is nice to watch film don&#39;t believe his WORDS,saaho is so entertaining and thrilling and twists and action and romance, saaho has all kinds of masala 4/5 rating and it&#39;s a good film yaaaaar what more you want 😍😍😍😍😍

Nice tricks by bollywood politics

I always wonder how this fat guy with salt &amp; pepper hair put his left leg on right all over this episode!! Doesn&#39;t he feel any pain having that big belly?!

Movie  is very good  for the people who don&#39;t want see regular indian masla movie. Rajeev&#39;s review is completely not acceptable

&quot;A Black Dot on White paper  Will highlight  the most..Just like negative talks of saaho&quot;...Review means just say good or bad...It doesnt mean to reveal full story....How dumb u r?...If u dont understand the movie,u think other s also cant understand....Saaho is good movie..go and watch it....I know,We know that bollywood is getting jealous of south and they are spreading negativity....But, I think Nothern people have humanity....So go and watch the movie...dont listen to fake reviews and negative talks....

You have to direct a movie not a show then we can learn  from it.Not setting in a chair explaining.i saw the movie it&#39;s  a classic movie.

Saaho download karna chahte toh mere channel per aao
How dare you insult videogames?

Why don’t you understand it is neither your traditional safe biopics nor your usual brands’ Mimicry .... agree Saaho is not for everyone’s understanding so take a chill 💊 &amp; stick to your rut please 🙏

Uncle is feeling very bad, he doesn't feel like watching a movie properly.
Flop movie sahoo
😂😂😂😂😂 daMn true Man
Differentiate between  -Blade runner/mad max/mission impossibleVs.<a href="">#Saaho</a>Action , visuals , screenplayNEVER SEEN BEFORE in indian cinema ..
worst movie of the decades..worst acting and dialogue delivery...cars crushing and fying here and there for no reason.. right after songs they crush a car with a tank really/ wtf... very songs and music aswell...another ram gopal verma ki aag

No story, no song, no comedy, no romance, no matching charactersWaste of time and money..Olny valence flim 👂 Sound  bang bang👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Flop movie yea bol be kitna paisa khyea he...

MADERCHODO HATERS FIRST DAY COLLECTION IS 100 CRORES.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Sandeep vangas words I recollect. .... Can u make a movie someday. I will review it . 2 star for Kabir singh. It went above 200 cr. 1.5 to saaho I will be happy with 150cr

You people cannot afford to upload video even in 720p and you are commenting the film that picturized and telecasting in 4k.You fatman with salt and pepper hair

Rajeev gave very low rating to this movie. I would go with 2.5/5. Direction can be improved and the movie length is a pain. Prabhas voice should be dubbed, his Hindi accent is another draw back of the Hindi version.

Lol... Prabhas needs sympathy for jumping from hill without questioning it&#39;s relevance... That&#39;s rajeev masand kind of roast.. nice

Mr. Rajeev the story and the screen play was good and Don&#39;t make fake reviews about flim as your not a god to be said. We should be proud that Indian movies growing such a rate that it hits to Hollywood. yes, Producer spended 350 rup for this movie and the graphics are worthy to watch. This is the first Indian movie that made this height.

Are wo rajamaoli hai makhi se bhi acting Kara sakta hai. Khans are still the bestttt

Assholes fearing of tollywood hero domination in bollywood🤣🤣🤙🏼🤙🏼..worst critic,shamelessly begged for interview with prabhas

U told that prabhas diving without shirt that scene has no relevance I think u didn&#39;t watch till end because that scene is relevant to the scene prabhas wearing jetpack nd that that shuts down nd he leaves the jetpack nd went to catch the shraddha kapoor (= parachute bag from that mountain diving scene) just watch clearly  sir

Move super good
What now after seeing this video i am having pounding headache ...... How you choose so bad words for such a hard work

I never seen rajeev scolding actors first time here

Why are you so  frusted? we enjoyed this movie alot  and we rate it 3 out 5.

😂😂😂

Sandeep Reddy Vanga.... pls we need ur review on this review.

Jealous salt n pepper guy. Ur 1.5 rating movie collected 100+ cr on day 1.
What a man Prabhas his What a work done in the. Movie  Saaho so much hard work done from 2 Years Prabhas This movie will earn 3000 crores They puted 350 crores Profits profits 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀

Even if your review is honest, you lost your credibility when you gave <a href="">#kabirsing</a> review......

This old man is suffering from boiling frog syndrome,exasperating farrago.

Next time am telling you no one will give interview for u beta

People are watching Movie, whether reviews are right or wrong and finally they are finding it awesome... Haha

chup chootye

Chup be.....it&#39;s better than bharat.

Uncle... it&#39;s a new generation action entertainer. I don&#39;t expect older people to like it....

You must be kidding me, rajiv!!..  You compared that crap called saho to video game .. Video games boasts the most moving stories I&#39;ve ever known..  Just look at Red dead redemption 2,  God of War, Metal Gear solid, Assassins creed.. And.. Oh.. The highest rated thing in entire imdb rating at 9.8.. The last of us.. And a lot other games Video games are the best medium to tell stories..

Aap video ko 420 rating dhera howle..🖕
Who is this guy and he does not know about movies and still Indian old brain and I don’t want a review from my father age guy...

Prabhas should learn from Ayushmann Khurana...small budget pack...bada dhamaka...like Andha dhund

With 1.5 rating mark my words collection of saaho Hindi version day 3&gt;day2&gt;day1 and it will cross 100 cr &quot;share&quot; overall for sure 😊 and it&#39;s a non holiday release with no khans

Salt and pepper guy don&#39;t talk technical aspects U do a movie We will give Review WASTE FELLOW

480p reviewing 4k film

Fat guy with salt nd pepper hair is back..... with review

This film comes in my top 5 ... WORST films ever. A wanna be trying too hard Hollywood action film with shots/ scenes taken fm several blockbusters but fails miserably. After 3 hours of a headache I still dint get the story nor was I bothered. I give half star.

Don&#39;t be wake up it&#39;s 2019 u like old intentions right

2lack cr rs

he is always with fancy English words ..... no review

hey why you can’t direct or act any one movie

If this an Hollywood movie or script..u will praise it right..?

Bakwas movie.. money time waste

Hey public Ko pasanth aa Rahi hai na ...tera review bash Mai Jaye..

Sir just to take in account,I guess you put out the review to let audience judge whether they should watch a certain movie or not but I think you use too much of an analytical english vocabulary which is very complex for a normal person to understand like common we arenot ofxord graduates nor are you i think! Probably i think you had an incomplete dream of studying from oxford or harvard. Like this is too much ridicolous &amp; irritating . Thanks.

Bakwasss hettt yaar wasted time
Shame on Tollywood people.. Bollywood people understand the movie they have brains except rajiv

I only watch because of Prabhas, i don&#39;t damn care about the movie. I only go in the theaters to see him

masand should have a conversation with Shashi Tharoor. I will be ready with 200 page notebook n dictionary

This guy sounds like he hits puberty his entire life!!!  .. .. 😂😂😂

Don&#39;t go for review its outstanding in terms of action and stunts just resembling other Hollywood Blockbuster

While rating a movie does he take account of the efforts put up on or behind the scene...

It&#39;s better than Hobbs n Shaw And many other useless movies u review...

You are right about the headache!

Thank god sir u gave 1 and half stars its huge i thought only half star sir u can give how silly every time u hiding u r stars i don&#39;t kniw why😋

Obese guy with salt and pepper hair... Kabir Singh director was right

Nice review Mind blowing explanation... Even I felt the same when I wasted 750rs of my pocket on fdfs

Hey friend let's say Hindi
Sa-thhoo

boring headache. I went yesterday. It was good for only action and stunts. Screenplay was worst. I could guess all the twists what happens next. romance was forceful.

Just watch it as a audience not as critic then you will get this.

Rajeev: Always ready to shake a leg with fellow cop 😂 Shraddha&#39;s not a versatile actor but here though she&#39;s a cop she&#39;s just the love interest who wears sexy clothes and dances. Typical Prabhas film. Usually he has 2 heroines and both are given little screen time 🤫

Logic hahahaha with crazy fan following logic is hard to find in a movie where hero is playing larger then life character.

Disliked without watching it because of this review on kabir singh

For starters Rs 2000 crores is peanuts in the eyes of professional Indian crooks who abound both within and outside the country ;  Prabhas is more at home in mythological and fictional  Avatars like in Bahubali rather than in action flicks; any police character has its inherent limitations ;  an IPS officer is no match, say to an SI or similar when it comes to bravery because of their inherent backgrounds ; trying to glorify the police in larger than life situations in movies such as these is far fetched and donot go well with the movie bluffs ! There fore, Saaho may not garner the kind of revenue it is expected of it !

Thank god somebody spoke.. I&#39;ve seen the film, I&#39;m a Prabhaas fan, but heavily disappointed with the way the movie was made.. There are so many people trying to make a positive review out of this chaotic messy film.. Thank you Rajeev..

I have come to this channel for tuition,
Nice review but only in 480p ???Thats embarrassing brother.

This man deserve to got kick in his butt

He gave bahubali 2.. only 3.5/5 stars.. which deserves 4.5/5 which gained all pan indian hearts and collected almost 2000 crores... its clearly showing partiality of south films.. isnt it?? I can strongly say no indian film as of now  made as saaho action scenes... plz go with it for action n suspense(twists).👍

480p Man 😃

Trying to save bollywood i guess

His review was nonsense today onwards I didn&#39;t watch his reviews from now on because I can&#39;t understand why he is creating soo much negative impact on movie...guys don&#39;t believe his review saaho movie was amazing it&#39;s pride of india

Brainless Telugu director Sujeeth somehow managed to hoodwink a bhookananga producer to finance this soulless garbage of a movie. Pathetic VFX,  mindless plot, and a story that goes on forever. I&#39;m angry that stupid Sujeeth didn&#39;t use Prabhas talents properly.

Flop actors like Neil Nitin MukeshChunky PandeyJackie Shroff ko Cast kiya On A Grand Scale To movie kitna acha hoga
350 freakin crores goodness gracious
worst movie in the recent times...considering the budget, starcast and the hype it tried to generate it....all the audience in the first 2 days who watched the movie including me thought it to be of a grand scale as bahubali in terms of visual effects, story, screenplay, dialogues, songs, actions....unfortunately sahoo didnt click 1 box among them....it deserves 0 stars...nothing more nothing less

Mr. Salt and pepper haired guy, nobody will explain u any thing like a tv serial, its a commercial and screenplay film, watch it again and again uncleji😂😂😂

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i&#39;m laughing very much reading the comments, this salt and pepper haired guy and rest of reviewers deserves the gaali&#39;s!!!

Good movie 4.5
This review &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The entire 3hr movie.

Tbh I knew this film would be bad or strictly average one time watch since  the first time I saw the trailer and the songs. Not kidding, I got so bored even watching the trailer that I fast forwarded it! 😑😑😐🤤

Here is the salt and pepper Fatso guy just got triggered by another movie.

That&#39;s how a typical telegu movie will be ... No logic and entertaining.. viewers should not try to find logic in every scene... Even most of the Hollywood movies are similar.. but people just accept what they say and don&#39;t question how is that possible...

Movie super
I think only critic doesn’t like saaho... as far audience had loved the movie

1½ out of 5..🤭🤭😂😂😂
Boring

My friend died, you saved me
I will half star for Your Face

Aro samba lafut 😡👊🤬🤺
I came here just to dislike

Ur reviews are fit for Hollywood.  Whatever the film from Hollywood   u like,  dirty accent and American slave, begger and a slave of usa

The conclusion of this 4 min video is it has floped badly

He clearly hasnt played many video games, just commented on them without any knowledge.

Word of the day - MacGuffinan object or device in a film or a book which serves merely as a trigger for the plot.&quot;the McGuffin in this intriguing comedy is an unpublished novel by  a young writer killed in the war&quot;

Hello fat guy , with salt and pepper hair !!

Very rude review Rajeev.....Cinematography and background score are the best I have ever seen and they did not deserve a mention in your review, did they? And this is exactly what the problem is with your guys reviews. You focus too much on how to bash the film and what phrases to use but in the end fail to do justice to the areas that deserve your genuine pat. The film was not not upto the mark due to bad editing, but the remaining 23 crafts are amazing and the film certainly deserves at least 2.5 stars for the efforts put in, the attempt made, the amazing work done by their technicians, the granduere in its visuals and the entertaining bits n pieces in the both halves. Bad review friend.

would love to see him and sashi tharoor conversing,

LOL i basically wanted to get out post interval and was continuously checking the time. Forget about logic, the film was plain and boring. I think I have the same feeling with Hrithik and Tiger&#39;s  WAR.

I think the producer of this film got a hint that there would be income tax raid at his home  so he made illogical Saaho....

And there comes the generous 1.5 rating

Bollywood vs Tollywood are you real? Get a life. A bad movie is a bad movie, period. No need to sugar coat a bad film. &#39;Prabhas&#39; Just because &#39;Prabas&#39; is in the film, doesn&#39;t mean a bad film needs to be accepted as good and talk good about it. For the die hard fans out there, &#39;Prabhas&#39; Let's learn a lesson or two (Rumoured: 80 crores) and be responsible in the future to use his stardom to produce better movies. + 350 crore production does not require a good movie. And stop panning the critics, there's nothing against Bollywood or Tollywood or any other wood for that matter.
Worst guy.....movie is awesome you are the one who gave 1 star to kabir sing....as sandeep says you are threat for Indian cinema

It fully depends on the director. Some directors make 1 line story and executed the movie extraordinarily. I think producer is the only man who works hard in this movie. I am giving 1 star for this movie.

Don&#39;t worry Prabhas ...Remember,this guy gave Kabir Singh 2.5 rating....😂😂😂

Hello Mr salt and pepper boy..you simply don&#39;t know any knowledge on movies and you have proven in Kabir Singh review..have you seen sahoo second half..?? And you still gave 1 and half rating?? Your dumb

What the hell is wrong with you man. Sahoo is worth watching. There is a lot of sweat and blood involved in making such films why are you giving negative review......

He looks very frustrated after watching the movie. Lol

Yesterday went to see.Came back during interval.

This is the real review.

When you realize that Rajeev masad uses Google translator on his mouth...hindi review 😂😂😂 dekh ke Aya..

man, your accent is so pathetic and irritating. makes me puke! and one more tip. short and fat people shouldn&#39;t sit cross-legged. it makes them even dwarfer. I never do!  just saying !

i always have serious doubts about big budget movies and saaho again proved me right , after race , Thugs ,zero , audience should act wiser.

Ur language and vocabulary is hard to understand.pls make it simple.i bet student of school level don&#39;t even understand it.i have a experience but now I understand at the age of 19.pls make it simple

Just say, Sahoo is bad film.That&#39;s it

This movie sucks because there is alot going on. So much confusion and script sucks. Action scenes are mostly copied and in some scenes VFX is very poor

This person should be sued ...he is  revealing the story of the movie

The shashi tharoor of reviewers.

The movie is super bad. They literally showed iron man suit in the end and Prabhas ditches that and catches Shradha without any gear in air ! Funny stuff...

War also going to be flop

Always knew that Prabahas is an overrated actor. i have seen some of his movies and except the Bahubali never liked any of them. Same all bullshit  exaggerated action, cringe dialogues and 90&#39;s type of stories. He can&#39;t make global audience fool , should stick to South India.

junior balakrishna prabhas
What era is this Rajeev? Why is your unit still producing videos in 480p? Sorry for taking this comment in this direction but I mean cmon, its 2019

Saaho is ridiculous that I understand that&#39;s the obvious thing for South..... But don&#39;t compare fast &amp; furious to mission impossible, man..... MI is way better than fast &amp; furious.... Every action scenes in MI are not just there for the sake of action movie. Plot is really good, especially plot of fall out.....

The biggest mistake in this movie was visual effects.....wth did they spend 350 crores

has he gone mad??he is comparing with mission impossible and fast and furious????those films are made so perfectly that they force u to believe that it is real.look at the stories,the action scenes.the stars don&#39;t dance around in picturesque locations😒😒😒.

SaahoFirst Day Second Show: In a city like Hanumangarh, it is very rare to see such a houseful show one after the other. There is a full house here on the first day. Now let's talk about the film..Song- &quot;Psycho Sayan, Baby I Won't Tell You&quot; These two songs are fine in the film, the other two songs are not so good. (2/5)Screenplay - Overall the screenplay was fine. Southern style was seen in many places. Many twists were seen in the story. The special thing about Saaho is that once you sit down to watch the film, you will wake up only after watching the entire film. (3.5/5) Acting- Prabhas' dialogues could have been better in Hindi, but the South version looks good. Whatever work there was for Shraddha Kapoor, it was excellent. Chunky Pandey's character in the film is interesting. Rest of the acting was strong. (5/5)Action- There is a lot of action. There is no lack in it, many action scenes will make you feel like watching them again and again. But at some places the South style came in where it showed too much. (3.5/5) Why go to watch the film - If you are fond of watching action films then definitely go. Apart from this, you will get to see such a film related to mind games for the first time. Why not go see it - If you are fond of watching Hollywood movies, then you will clearly see that many scenes are inspired by Hollywood. Film Review- Overall the film is worth watching. If we talk about the story, it is good, you will definitely feel like hearing the rest of the story related to the film. It is really a matter of pride to make such a film in India. You can watch this film with family and friends.(3.5/5)
After watching Saaho..Me- Ye toh tatti hai😂

Me preparing for my GRE vocabulary section...

U deserve nothing for doing  all this bloody shit. U make movie or write a script    and tell us to review. Those who can&#39;t make movies they do judge.

Guys it&#39;s really disappointing

1.5*

One and half hahah

One and a half stars is way too generous, Rajeev.

Prabhas one man show

Bsdk

143 paribhasha I miss you
This movie deserves 0 stars. It&#39;s boring and ridiculous with over the top, bizar, endless  stupid action scenes.

skipping it

Didn’t expect any less than a roast!!

The trailer and songs were not promising at all. It was overhyped but most of us expected it to be garbage. Now on a different note, I saw Prabhas&#39;s interviews. He looked very tired nowadays.  In the film too I found him tired. I think he needs to reduce some weight.

Prabhas and Shradha be like: Why the hell did we give interview to him!!

bahubali is benchmark, prabhas should very carefully choose movies (or directors)

Prabhas fan don&#39;t go mad on Rajeev.same guy who gave bahubali 4 🌟  because of content.1 and half means its bad.He is our honest critics don&#39;t care any superstar..thats why salman khan Fan don&#39;t follow him.

Dusro par dhabba lagane mein indian first no.  Pe hai... jaate hi kyon ho movie dekhne ko... kyon baki logon ko disturb kar rahe ho. Only prabhas

Yes they put us in lot of pain

Is he the one &quot; FAT GUY with salt n pepper hairstyle &quot;  whom Kabir Singh Director called.

Haai uncle, ur boy friend Karan mamu is taking K4G, pls reserve your 5 stars for that motu uncle..

Why t-series thought prabhas is a big superstar is beyond my comprehension At best, he can serve the role of a henchmen for an antagonist in some cheap popcorn flick like this film

It is so rediculous for <a href="">s.one</a> to dare to critisize the hard work of a whole team during 3 years and gives a review in just 3minutes it&#39;s soo easy to sit on chair and give 1.5/10points

If you do such reviews for money then it would be better if you go in front of the temple and get a lot of money, then you will tell that your country will not get any benefit.
Ignore all the reviews and experience the best action thriller from INDIA!!!

Saving grace Prabhas and great action  dats all I wantMany critics don&#39;t even understand Hollywood scripts they just good ratings 😂😂

Lmfao his reviews always have me laughing til my stomach hurts oh my.. too funny!

I only came here to learn new english words

&quot;Depth and emotional wallop of a video game&quot;?? Have you ever played a video game in your life ? Stick to movies, Mr. Masand. You clearly do not have the required information or the maturity to understand the depth of video games.

I don’t know what video games you have played but quite a few have emotional depth

This bastard did not talk about the craft, did not talk about the performances, just came to spread negativity. Sandeep Reddy gave the right answer that at the time of Kabir Singh, still did not improve you mad**chod.
What does this guy know about video games.

People  keep hating on rajeev because they like to watch shit on regular basis.

Yes, you are absolutely right; When Prabhas mentioned that it&#39;s a screenplay film not focused on story, I was expecting a popcorn entertainer but still I got disappointed 😞

1 time watch for prabhas👍

If it really had the depth and the emotional wallop of a video game it would be a much better movie. just sayin

I feel very bad that I wasted 180 rps for ticket,what producer who spent 350 crores may feeling now.......

Awesome movie..review sucks

lol thank god honest review only expect from you so far.... what a garbage movie, just dont watch

Really liked the movie ...dont listen to the review and decide  ...watch it and comment.

When Shraddha Kapoor was announced as the leading lady, I guess I had predicted the outcome of the movie. It delivered to my expectations 🤣🤣🤣

Your r a <a href="">#PaidCritics</a> ManFlop Review

KGF 2 is loading... get ready

Shubh Prabas :)
I was eagerly waiting for SAAHO.but now I have fixed my mind..It&#39;s forcing me to skip this movie.

Its Saaho. Its barometer is not story but how well the action scenes are. Do they raise the standard or not? Looks like you are too used to seeing hollywood action, that we forget that we wanted similar from bollywoodYou agree with that it will be mindless and then you shroud for not having story. Decide on what you want first.

didn&#39;t learn from thugs of hindostan....big budgets doesn&#39;t matter...script does...boring movie

Saying in simple words &quot; it is a flop&quot; allright..

better skip the headache..

Surprisingly your and Rahul Desai’s review is almost same!

Did he just casually downplay the emotional depth of video games?

His reviews are very useful for preparing bank exam 😂😂

Way too overhyped! What a waste of money, talent and resources! These days you can&#39;t get away with serving utter nonsense!

Most telugu,Tamil films are trash..I can say and vouch for that even without seeing <a href="">#Saaho</a>￼...very amused by rest of India&#39;s addiction to dubbed Telugu and Tamil films on TV and internet

1.5 stars is too much...I expected 0 stars

This movie has been overhyped. Many of my friends went to watch and everyone said it was really bad. I had a lot of expectations from this, but I am going to skip this.

Syeraa next disaster coming soon
Fat guy with salt &amp; pepper hair😂😂😂

This happens when u try to compensate talentless director and soul-less script with big budget.

Your reviews are better suitable for the one&#39;s who will prepare for GRE and IELTS 😂😂

kabirsingh was also shit as per u..

&quot;The fat guy&quot;

l m feelig  sad  fo sujeeth
lm getting scred fo his next movie director praphas said its a love story based on 9tnees  that director also made Stupid movie called jill stup masala movies and hes directing love story lm realy scared

I guess people are not fully understanding the screenplay.May be really director is at fault.But the movie is received better by general audience. Even my friends liked the movie.  Time will be kind towards this movie like 1 and Khaleja

I was appalled at the songs especially the lyrics in Hindi. And Prabhas is looking so unkempt. I get that the beauty standards for male stars are quite low but one must still look awake and enthusiastic. Glad that this mediocre shit will be a flop, just worried how it got such a huge budget and the blind fans in the first place.

Oh yeah baby

Most of the reviewers are not liking this movie.What happened to South Indian talent?
