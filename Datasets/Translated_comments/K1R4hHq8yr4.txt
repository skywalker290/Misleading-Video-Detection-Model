When I see the ants I probably call for a truce.

where to watch this movie

I remember seeing this in theaters with my mom and she immediately covered my eyes, not wanting me to be traumatized. 

looks like a natural day to me

I SMELL 2008

I can see there&#39;s alot of debating about ants and I have another question.  Wouldn&#39;t hydroclouric acid in human stomach harm  at least some of them?

MARABUNTA

2024???????

What is the movie called?

This scene hits a little too close too certain ants in Africa. I nearly lost my little brother to them.

Movie name
Ants:the first human

I watch that ever day like march .12 2007

2024 like?

wasnt there a movie with GIANT ants in like the 80s/90s?! im pretty sure

Why couldn’t the dude just get up when the ants were pulling him

This was how Ant-Man was born

Worst part is I think these ants are real

because of this i couldnt put me feet on the ground bc of phobia

This scene gives me so much agony, just imagine you are feeling good and out of nowhere the ants enter your mouth, your nose and take you to the anthill. 

The only thing i missed from dial of destiny is a brutal fight like this against klaber or hawke with a gruesome death near the end of the movie. At least there is the short but cool fight against colonel weber in the prologue

Glory to the USSR
This set piece was actually repurposed from Last Crusade. If I remember correctly, they nixed it then because...yeah, I don&#39;t know how you could&#39;ve done it in the 80&#39;s.

Hey Indiana Jones go the shower

god, this movie is so bad

As stupid as this movie was, it was quite entertaining.

It’s hilarious how these ants sound like chipmunks.

This is still one of the most satisfying villain deaths in a long time.

very scary
New fear has unlock

As per researchers there are 20 quadrillion ants in the whole World or could more than that, more than the weight of the all humans beings on earth. Estimated 250 millions ants for each person. Ants are not smarter than compared to human beings but as per researchers says millions of billions of ants come to their and attached with each other and creates a Super brain phenomena, for example if you see in this video, that women who is hanging to the tree Ants trying to reach her all together thats only super brain can think such thing. Imagine if all the ants on the earth decided to attack Humans on earth than it will be situation like Gog and magog can occurs

Ooooo

I did not need to see ants go in the mouth

America:no is not Australian i got bite

Oh my god the red ants have gone in his mouth his nose and his ears

Ford still looked SO good in this movie. It´s a shame he looks actually quite old in the latest Indy film. It´s striking to see the difference between the two.

I remember when I watched this movie when I was like, 12, and I, like, imagined Solid Snake in place of the bald guy or something. Like, so wild.

<a href="">21:50</a> me: smashes ants with a giant hammer

No matter how bad it his movie is it is great to see this brutal scene

name of the movie please

my kid watched this scene,and he did not get traumatized,but gaged when the ants got into the man&#39;s mouth.

Why the ants just passin by indiana jones

I was unfortunate enough to see a video in which an army of ants kill and take apart a crab...I believe some insanity like this could happen.

Harrison Ford was only about 64 or so here hadn&#39;t changed at all really. I look back now and realize how GOOD this one was compared to the new one. He just looked way to different, didn&#39;t act the same, terrible story, and no Steven Spielberg!! So it was an instant turn off for me, also they tried to hard. Made this one look like Raiders by comparison.

this scene looks very amazing! Bravo. Lol

Thanks god! I would give u all I dont

Wow!
probably one of the most horrible ways to die in movies

Is that real

Nah i watched the mummy with my brother and dad when i was FIVE i was traumatized 

<a href="">1:18</a>

Sometimes i am asking myself... Why Spielberg always made these kinds of scene?-In first Indiana Jones was that melting scene, or plane propeller and those skeletons inside of that tomb.-In second Indiana Jones it was that secret path full of insects (that was real actually, not probs) and of course that heart scene with lava.. and last that mining grinder.-In third Indiana Jones, it was that trap decapitation scene, and yeah wrong holy grail.-And in Indiana Jones 4, it was this scene with ants, and Spalko aliens knowledge scene. Now when i watch it again.. I am telling in my head, please Indy take your revolver and make them to not suffer these horrifying deaths.Sometimes it feels like that he doesn&#39;t want to even make this movie for kids.But still its my most favourite movie saga.

Why the duck does this have nearly 300 million views

<a href="">1:18</a> i wish i was that ant

Disgusting 

This is a movie to persons have to fight and escape i think about so mutch pepole

Whats crazy is ordinary ants will actually do this if they&#39;re starved and have no other food supply.

I may not speak Russian, but I could tell he was screaming “Oh dear god help!  Oh god help!” at <a href="">2:03</a>

What a stupid death. He&#39;s not even reacting to hundreds of Ants going into his mouth/throat.

<a href="">1:19</a> The Internet is Gonna have a Field Day with this.

My dad thought this was a bad movieI genuinely thought it was not that bad But i’m not a big fan of most of the action sequences

Crazy to think that this is PG-13 but Indy mercy-killing the dude to save him the agony of being devoured by ants would&#39;ve pushed it to an R-rating.

Heeee Haaaa Beeeeee <a href="">0:19</a>

At least it was ants and not roaches.



I was always terrified of this as a kid. Just the thought of them crawling inside him and the fact that he&#39;s upside down in the nest AHHH

man i remember when i was 7 when the movie released i remember this scene and when the ants crawled in his mouth i legit almost vomited still to this day that specific scene still makes my skin crawl

Who’s the bad guy here?

The scariest Indiana Jones movie I&#39;ve ever seen

<a href="">0:49</a> - great combo Indy - this should be in Mortal Kombat

I like how the other man survive by showing a skull

I mean props to kate blanchet for being able to climb a rope if it was actually her, although it looked genuine to me, but yeah a super colony of ants this big would be too busy fighting each other to worry about anything else

When I was a child I used to take big bugs or little spiders and put them in anthills with a stick to see how ants would storm it in a matter of seconds, I found it interesting.Seeing this scene was like a warning to stop doing that cruel thing

Ya this recently happened to my neighbor and me after a huge fight we had.  (I live in Australia)

The only animal that could do this are the army ants and they would be kind off cooler. Their nest walls are made of ants.

That must be a very paintful death jeez

Silly movie but I’d watch it over Dial of Diarrhoea any day of the week.

I wonder why youtube age restricts an innocent video from coryxkenshin, but let&#39;s a child traumatizing movie scene roam freely

Bros got a free ant buffet

Producers: “How unrealistic do you want this scene to be?” Director: “Yes.”

Indonesians: Looks like an average day for me.Because.. 5 minutes after waking up i see millions of ants marching down my garden, imagine if one of them hold a flag

This is what was missing in Dial of Destiny: the powerhouse goon suffering a brutal death.

Bro just became the dinner of the day

Reminds me of when Veruca Salt was dragged by squirrels into the garbage chute

Fun fact: ants can actually get this big in real life

Call me crazy but the soldier is the same SS soldier  from Saving Private Ryan. The one that stab the knife in the heart.

I&#39;d rather be burned at the stake than that endure that horrible death.

All the movies are brilliant 

Saifu ants also known as driver ants come from Africa not Brazil also yes they do go in humans to suffocate the victims but no way they can take a full grown human to a nest

Y&#39;all didn&#39;t realize that the ants were going inside this guy&#39;s mouth!?

What a horrid way to go.

Ants crawling in his nose

<a href="">1:59</a> it remind me of a death from rick and morty. In the vendicators, the ghost train guy had an argument with the crew and he got killed by the man made of ants (by entering into his body and blowing him up like an overstuffed ballon).One of the most disturbing death in the whole serie.

And <i>that</i> is the ant of him.

I don&#39;t love this movie, as a whole, but I love this scene.  First, it&#39;s a breath of fresh air to have a movie fight without all the complicated choreography (which I typically do enjoy).  Here, it&#39;s just two guys punching each other until someone drops.Second, the ants are fantastic.  The CGI is really well done and, as shown by the comments on this video, as effective as the series&#39; previous &quot;creepy crawly&quot; sequences.  The fact that they carry the Russian into the ant hill is so bonkers that I adore it.

This movie sucked.

childhood trauma

Ridiculous. Too bad Hollyweird sets about ruining the old classic heroes.

Ohio ant be like:

When the Russian soldier was dragged down into the hole of the ant hill, in a clear reference to the sarlaac Pit, the lips of the ant hill should have puckered before letting out a giant farting sound, referring to the Russian soldier being dragged deep into its bowels. It would probably have given this film a more serious tone.

ANTS TEAM
Because they eat ants from Diabetes

These were the golden days of these type of movies in 2004-2009 era baby

The ants weren&#39;t a terrible idea. But to keep things unique, since insects had already been done, and to capitalize on this taking place in South America, I definitely would&#39;ve gone with piranha. Could&#39;ve had gruesome and characteristically bloody deaths with an easy way to hide whatever would net an R-rating.

Imagine dying to fire ants bro 

<a href="">1:13</a> this is where it turned into a loony tunes cartoon with those ants

What kind of answers that?

Bro <a href="">1:19</a> that was some juicy ant

The bad guy getting killed by those ants was the worst scene I didn&#39;t liked in that movie because it was too nasty.

Deserve

Honestly I can see why people didn’t like this movie. Not just because of the story but this scene in particular just looked… fake. The lighting looked very off, like they were mixing the classic action style with modern cgi and it just looks weird. The surroundings look unnatural too. But at the end of the day, an Indiana Jones movie will never be not entertaining, at least to me

That would suck

Amazon ants can consume human skin not whole but shred a piece of skin if its one if its a lot tons of skins but the human will live a bit unskinned and maybe die from venom

Me: <b>gets dragged by ants</b>Also me: <b>puts subspace tripmine in the hole</b>

<a href="">2:06</a>

Morag: SOMEBODY TO COME FROM LOUDS!!!!

you could still see and squirming and as he was caried by the ant for HELP in russian &quot; AAAAAAAAAAGH &#39;Pamagitjea!!!!! 2 or 3 time or so, but i think he died the moment only his knees were left outside as the stopped moving.

Darla Sherman: Ugh! (Crying)

That was a bad picnic.

Everything here is pretty inaccurate cuz ants or bugs won&#39;t crawl on you, only if they gain your trust. If they are intimidated by your presence then they will crawl on you if they are dangerous bugs, if they are regular ants or something like that then they will run away

This guy getting killed and eating by giant ants and beetles is sad and not hilarious

8 years old me: Im gonna watch indiana jones and this funny skullme too after this movie: Ants are horrible , and i need to go to psycho guyme now: Yuck! this still look like horrible death!

Even looking at 10 ants is disgusting, let alone that many
What the hack

Omg no way it 10000000000000000000-000–00000000000000000000 bugs ahahahahhahahah

<a href="">1:57</a>: Thumbnail.

I saw this scene as a kid and it truamatized me

He continues screaming even when the ants are in his mouth. In reality he would have choked

I like how the music goes. when Indiana jones wave his fist up at <a href="">1:51</a>

The ants when I leave candy on the floor for a few days:

Or should we say, GiANTS?

This movie clip has been sponsored by Raid Ant Baits; giggle!

When the ants take the guy i hear him to speak greek when he screams

Bruh cringe. 0/10
Havent seen this movie since it first came out. Forgot how horrifying it was. Yikes.

Ants: at least im patient <b>man fells</b>Timmeh and jimmeh and kimmeh and the ants:TEAM ANTSS!!!

How ant man was created

Indiana Jones never fails to create some of the most brutal deaths in their films

Well that was villlet

Astagfirullah, this is fake, sis

Ok that was enough it blow up my mind and scared me antmaphobia

That is a lot of ants

Very good movie

Suspension of Disbelief remains in this scene, it is not possible that some 2,000 ants are capable of lifting a human weight, more specifically, about 85 kg

Jones was like “bro my bad I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.” 

How many ants are here

I don&#39;t understand there are millions of giant ant&#39;s and this guys are fighting what the hell is going on I&#39;ll be like keep the skull who cares 

just so everyone knows, he was screaming “help” in russian

is this species of ants realy exist ?

I watched some movies with these kinda ants as a child, terrific tbh

interesting I saw this first when I was 10 and it did not scare or frighten me. I thought it was sick, yes, but I did not find it scary or disturbing

I wish you were Turks too
Is this an insect?
What is the name of the movie?
How itchy that feels tf

The ants right now: <b>celebrating watching the fight</b>

i like this movie i dont care what the haters say

Nasty
I remember I watched this video when it had 263k views now it has 266 milion

I am itchy now.
Dude, this isn't an ant and the DEVIL 
Bro punched mid air  and then the guy that looks russian fell

Top ten must disturbing shows! 1. Whatever this is.


Satisfactory

Hello my is öykü ho war you l dont
The part that hurts is that one big ant can hurt alot

While ants could certainly strip a human corpse within a few hours, there&#39;s no way that any amount of them could overpower a human and physically drag them.

i remember watching this clip when i was 5 now i am 12 lol

He was hungee

Cool one

silly lil insects!!! being the freaks they naturally are!!!!!

You can kill one hundred ants but you can&#39;t kill one billion ants.

Ants are indeed terrifying, bullet ants, fire ants and siafu ants are examples

Well he’s def not gonna be in Indiana Jones 5

Would have been much more effective if the movie director had directed the villain actor to stop screaming and starting coughing. Really send home the idea that ants were choking up his airway. Instead, we just see ants going in, and he keeps yelling like he has no obstruction. Destroys any sense of congruity. Makes it hard to imagine those ants could be anything other than CGI. But if he switched from screaming to coughing, as though he had just gotten some water into his lungs or something, that would really sell the visuals of screen a lot better, I think.

Indiana always making tricks. They say he is brave, but looks like a coward.

<a href="">1:16</a> how would a single ant kill her

Strong ants yes

me after stepping on an anthill i didn&#39;t see <a href="">1:56</a>

mcm babi

Am I the only Indonesian here?
The dream Han Solo had when got frozen in Carbonate

I heard Indiana jones from Fortnite 

Wow, glad I stopped watching these after like the first two. How CGI unrealistic and stupid this is.

The first thing u think is scary are the ants going in his mouth but the thing is that if ur at the brink of dying the scariest thing is that ur gonna die and not that the ants are going in ur mouth.

Ready?  Fight!

Did he dieded??
How come the camera man is safe from the ants i wanna be safe from ants too

This scene traumatized me as a child omg in 2008 I was 5/6 years old

<a href="">1:46</a> that guys face tho 

I just wanna know how they managed to get this scene (also, I hate seeing people suffer)

Say whatever you want about this movie but the soundtrack goes hard

Odbi

Ah yesChildhood trauma

large insect

It’s a pity of course it was first
<a href="">2:02</a> Am I the only one who heard the word Help?
Since I know a lot about ants this just makes laugh

What kind of bugs are these?
This clip gave me nightmares when I watched it I was 9!

It's funny how Americans are always the good guys in most movies.
Man is Died( <a href="">2:10</a> ) Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

It&#39;s just my room,  nothing more

Props to the cameraman he was able to fly

<a href="">2:00</a> gross

It’s amazing how terrible this movie looks. The cgi and the actual people never look like they occupy the same space and there is waaay to much light. Just feels like it’s a lit set with a green screen. Look how many times the sun changes where it’s coming from.

<a href="">1:56</a> I got cold shivers. And then I went On the floor to look at it. Cuz I was on sofa and I thought that all those ants are on the sofa.

And Indy has this face like &quot;sorry, not sorry&quot;.

Wa

I watched this as a child am 9 i watched this at 6 or 7 rn i was at my cringe phase 6 months ago and i love it

Knowing that this would never happen in real life makes it Indiana Jones worthy

This is what happened with Kang in Antman 3

<a href="">1:53</a> Giant eagle ant Russian&#39;s

I think this is one of the most viewed scenes from a movie on YouTube.

Why he let Indy to continue crawling over to grab the stick is beyond me

Ooo

Ants: yes! Now we have a giant food for our dinner wohoooo!

<a href="">1:54</a> is the best part!

I&#39;m sadistic to that neighbor named Carriedo unpopular unlike the Q &quot;Quiapo&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter which sides you are.

Mmmm CGI
Loved that scene as a kid. I would throw punches on the Air imitating indy&#39;s goofy fighting skills.

A ANT ARMY OF 1,000,000,000 UNITS BE LIKE

I just saw this clip in something and somehow knew it was from crystal skull despite only seeing the move like once or twice over a decade ago I was shocked to see the clip had 250million+ veiws I assume a lot of people feel the same

Why didn’t she keep RUNNING!!!! Why would you climb a tree!!!!!????

When I saw this I woke up and was asking &quot;was that a dream?&quot; Sooo Ig it isnt

If i see those im gonna really drop a nuke on that

I had this movie on DVD as a child and whenever this scene came on I thought the ants would burst out of the DVD player and attack my family. I always asked my parents to skip this scene.

Ant i mean
Argh i dont like this and

Bro this trauma doesn&#39;t came out of my head! 

Average day in Australia

<a href="">1:15</a> crush me pls 
Damn they really toned down the deaths in this movie

<a href="">1:54</a> the ant

<a href="">1:53</a> I don't know why that scene gives me satisfaction.
It&#39;s a totally terrifying scene and a scary concept, of course, but the whole execution is way too catholic, it reminds me of Looney Tunes.

it scares me how he is carried into the whole

I wonder what that guy say as he entered the ant mound…that’s what I think is the really scary part

South America have the biggest ants in the world. They should have brought a flamethrower

<a href="">1:55</a> me after I learn the crimson paw&#39;s identity revealed

<a href="">1:38</a>

Thats actually a funny scene. Ants attack only the soldier not Indy. Certainly. Probably the ants are fans of original Indy series

Gotta get quadrillion raid cans

This scene with the giant ants from Indian Jones traumatized me as a child

omg

These arent giant ants they are normal ants just literally billions of them

Ants in ohio 

This scene traumatized me as a kid

A part of Antman’s training kinda reminds me of this

<a href="">0:20</a>  Why do they sound like baby goats?!

The ants when they are fighting:eh let’s give them sone space and then when one of them falls well take take them to the nest….

Amazing Movies
<a href="">2:03</a> he screamed help!!
My mum saw this and now know why I drown ants

This scene is probably a myrmecophobe&#39;s worst nightmare

That scene at <a href="">1:54</a>, that was totally disgusting. 

friend looking at the ants in disgust
Me: (to Irina): Kill it! Kill it! Kill it, girl! Come on! You&#39;re a killer! Maim it! Wound it! Insult it! Something! Kill it! Kill it! Kill! Kill! Kill!Irina: (squishes the ant with her knees)(Reference to Igor)

I bet he won’t come and be coming out because his body is just gonna be a skeleton once he goes down that hole

ants in ohio:

<a href="">1:16</a> that&#39;s gotta hurt

When we have a Vac that can suck up everythingThese ants problem would be solved

Ants are smart and deadly when they work together 

POV you feed your ants live food

I wouldn&#39;t mind them being wiped out. No cap

I think it was a pretty brutal death.
I used to love this scene
It's so bad...
I remember this scene Many Years Ago, All Tho I Never Watched Indiana Jones This Is Very Disturbing

This movie has gotten worse with age.

New fear unlocked.
Jesus Christ died for all of our sins. He died the death we all deserved. He was the perfect one who never sinned once, but he loved us so much he decided to die for us so our sins would be paid for and we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven before God the Father blamelessly. He is the living son of God who wants to know us and have a personal relationship with us. No matter  what you have done no matter how far gone you think you are Jesus can and will save you. All you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Believe that he died on the cross for your sins and had a bodily resurrection 3 days later. We cannot be saved by our works but by faith in Christ alone. Repent and turn to Christ. You will have joy, happiness, love, and peace beyond understanding.

What’s he saying as he’s being dragged away

Gigachad ants

is vari scari

Disgusting

Liam Neeson is a great actor for Indiana Jones.

Difference between old movies and this one: the actors didn&#39;t look like they were flailing around in front of a green screen. You don&#39;t need massive cgi, just simple practical effects and stories that were never captured on film before.

<a href="">0:51</a>  I love that combo.

i hated this movie so much

haha

Nightmare

<a href="">1:34</a>

You can really tell Ford is getting old in this scene

<a href="">1:56</a>

This scene had me traumatized

<a href="">1:15</a>

I saw this first when I was 10 and it did not scare or frighten me. I thought it was sick, yes, but I did not find it scary or disturbing. The other kids in my class thought the same about this scene, sick, but not scary or disturbing. Some kids can handle and/or take scenes like this, some can’t. Not all kids are the same.

I literally felt goosebumbs when I first time saw this scene, I just don&#39;t know what kind of hell that guy see inside the nest.

I remember watching this movie with my Dad heh... A long time ago... Now I&#39;ll be watching it alone... Heh

How is he still screaming with all those ants crawling into his mouth?

Even if the guy is a bad person, it&#39;s a pity

Schifo

Ok I am deleting my comments

He died?
Like Crazy Azz
It’s just black
Grave robber Indiana Jones deserves to die
I am crying right now because they are killing people

Thats so scary

You&#39;d need a hell of a lot of molten aluminum to deal with that.

<a href="">0:57</a> Uncle vlad? Is that you?

these are actually fire ants the most deadly ants of all time they will not stop until the job is done

Funny how none of them tough of pull each other for the ants.

264 Million views. WOW. Funny how the movie is so chill but the death scenes are really violent

Ants: we’re gonna devour youCrystal Skull: wanna bet?Ants: just a prank bro

Remember, it&#39;ll never be an Indiana Jones movie without at least one child traumatizing scene

Wouldn&#39;t the safari ant (Siafu) be an Invasive species if brought to South America?

Thats the most horrible way an Indy villain has gone out

I thought this was an OK Indiana Jones film. Just OK.There is no chance I&#39;m gonna see the new one. At least the strong female Russian woman in &#39;Kingdom&#39; was watchable. Indiana Jones 5 I can just tell the female characters are TOO 2022.You know what I mean.

Ants are really harmless, but when they are together they are deadly. I love Indian Jones. This clip is dead scary for people with Myrmecophobia (fear of ants).

I typed in &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull best scene&quot; and this showed up. Have to agree this is the best scene of the movie. It&#39;s the moment I remembered the most.

my voice echoes
What is the title of the movie?
He stays perfectly still to get the cgi shot and his voice doesn’t change even though his throat fills with ants. Sh** film.

Lord, it’s good that we don’t have such, damn it, it seems that I’m going to vomit now

There is 100 nonilion

Hypocrisy causes disbelief, hypocrisy is deceptive. Judge a human&#39;s deeds, not the human

<a href="">1:55</a> origin story for million ants

the cameraman is always safe
Saw this scene as a kid and it gave me a full blown phobia of ants. I needed therapy when I got older and everything. Obviously phobias are complex and there was other stuff going on but this scene was definitely the begining of it. Over ten years later and I came back to see how I would cope- saw the thumbnail, and immediately freaked out. Not ready to face this yet but figured I&#39;d leave a comment so that if I ever do finally get up the courage to watch it again I can see it and hopefully feel a little bit proud. Amazing scene, ruined my life lol

when i got eated by this movie

this is why I don&#39;t like ants

Cool
I remember my dad taking me to see this when I was 6 years old. This scene scarred me for life

I didn&#39;t even know this was from Indiana Jones!

I know people hate this movie but this was a cool action sequence plus it wouldn’t be Indiana Jones without an over the top villain death scene.

This haunted me for years.

What he should be find

Finally found my childhood memories i like this movie 

A deadly ant swarm is scary enough on its own, but like everything else in this movie, they just had to take it a notch too far into silliness.

&quot;Ok that&#39;s enough internet for the day.&quot;

I got scared, and the worms got into his body and mouth

The camera man: it’s ok

I was such a big fan of Indiana jones as a kid, I was ecstatic that I was going to be able to see a new one in my time.

Yeee

Harrison Ford Vs Igor Jijikine
There were good moments in this movie.  The Area 51 chase, reuniting with Karen Allen.  But overall it was a mess.  The terrible cgi, stupid scenes like swinging through the jungle, over the waterfall, nuclear refrigerator scene, really messed things up imo.

For a moment there I thought Vladimir Gluten was going to kill Indy.

What is the name of this movie

The real life version of these ants, driver ants, aren&#39;t anywhere close to this. First of all their nomadic, so they wouldn&#39;t have big underground nests. They&#39;re a lot smaller and look nothing like these. Still really impressive though

<a href="">0:40</a> they fighting but THERES SO MANY ANTS

More Deaths Spiders killed mans like?

Who created Adam, the first of the offspring, and who provided you with money and health, and who created you out of nothing, and who answers the sad and distressed if he calls him.. and he is the one who knows the date of your death and who has kept your heartbeat until now so that you know and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth and enter Islam. Why is this poor and this rich? Have you ever wondered why this one died when he was young and this one when he was old, and what is found in the grave and the resurrection…..or do you think that you were created in vain,.. the world is a test house and work in order to be rewarded for what you did on the Day of Resurrection?

Oops, glug ben ten boy, glug ben ten daddy
I would like to thank this movie for scarring me as a child for life.

Being eaten from the inside out by big dam ants is kinda terrifying

Ahhhhh, nothing beats an ample dose of revisited childhood trauma

I am always itchy when watching this scene

I hate ants. I love to light them on fire and watch them burn slowly  they deserve it.

POW!!!

WHAT?! Is this giant ants?

I enjoyed this film but there were some really questionable scenes that I wonder if it was George Lucas’ writing or Steven’s direction that’s at fault more as the swinging scene was just ridiculous looking but I’m sure it could have been executed better had it not looked so fake and uncanny.

The spider scene from the Mist was also creepy af

This scene haunted me as a kid

<a href="">1:57</a> can we just see how disturbing this is and now I&#39;m afraid of 

Yick. The dragging the man down scene will always get me

Me the ant killer verses the ants: mom can we get gallons of water

oxiiiron was eaten by bugs

Ah yes, the traumatizing scene that gave me nightmares at the age of 5 and Entomophobia/fear of insects (specifically ants). It’s been 7 years now and to this day I’m still deathly scared of ants  “yay”

Reminds me of the even more horrifying scene in Walking With Beasts.

I remember seeing this scene for the first time in 3rd grade and it game me insomnia for weeks, now its one of my favorite movie death scenes

austrailians: looks like a normal day to me.

Gross

<a href="">0:19</a> That sounds like Han Solos &quot;Yeaawhoooooo!&quot; from Star Wars A New Hope just after he puts Vader&#39;s TIE into a tailspin.
