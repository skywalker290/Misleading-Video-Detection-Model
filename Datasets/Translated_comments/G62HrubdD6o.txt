The only movie we can watch 100 times

Bahubali is bahubali

2024 january month who is watching

I m just wondering why do people release movie immediately after doing it ? Why not store it and release after 3-4 years and take advantage of inflation of price of tickets ? Atleast for this film I see it would be good

One and only epic masterpiece of Indian cinema...and Prabhas acting just mind-blowing....no one can match this

Jis time yeh movie aayi thi us time saare show housefull the theatre ke stairs pe baith ke yeh movie dekhi thi kya experience tha itna rush aajtak nahi dekha tha kabhie bhi

2024 ---
Serious question here, long time movie buff, I love foreign films, but have always avoided Bollywood due the musical/dance numbers. I just could not wrap my head around it. That being said, I just watched &quot;RRR&quot; and loved it. You think I would dig this, parts one and two? Are they similar? I gotta say, trailer looks cool.

It&#39;s 2024 and this masterpiece still gives me chills‍

This is the beginning of the career of pure BOLLYWOOD WAALO, , I AM A BERY HUGE FAN OF DARLING PRABHAS  ANNA
2024 wale like kro

Who is watching in 2024 

Who is after See Salar..

At the time of this movie, someone had asked that 'why did Kattappa kill Bahubali'?
I remember. I was 7 when this came out and somehow my dad got a good print version of it in my Ipad and I watched it everyday before sleeping and also I was very obsessed with this.Childhood was damn good.

Anybody after Salaar ?
Almost 7 years and no movie has come closer in terms of epic Theatrical experience for me like this....

27-11-2023 present here..

Bahubali 1 and part 2 that&#39;s only one peace most incredible movie on Indian history

SSR should remake or remaster this movie with better VFX and re-release

Six years passed but I&#39;m still watching this trailer 

Animal after watch this trailorSame Goosbems 

This is called ACTION MOVIE
So.... basically it&#39;s Game of Thrones (low fantasy) + 300 (Bombastic, Hammy,  Loud, with Highly stylized action) + Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Lots of fancy physics-defying stunts and wire-fu with minimal CG), but set in India........Sign me the fuck up!!!!

No movie can create hype and box office record like bahubali 2. I watched this movie more than 20 times

If i could erase my memory and rewatch this masterpiece

The power of SS RAJAMOULI SIR 
I know many would disagree, but somehow this trailer didn&#39;t capture how great the Movie was. I just watch Shivam song to relive the magnificent creation Baahubali was

How rajamouli presented prabhas and look how om raut presented him, prabhas is a good actor but need good directors at this point of time.

Adipurush and Radhe Shyam ended the career of Prabhas Sir. Now he has become a worst actor in the eyes of people.Thank u S.S Rajamouli sir and Prabhas for this masterpiece 

Anyone after adipurush release?? 

After watching Adipurush:  Prabhas showed us that anything can happen in life

Jab Bahubali 1 ko north side Dekh ke bol rahe the ki Ending acha nhi he south movie he..... Un logo ko nhi pata Tha Part 2/Chapter 2 asa bhi kuch dekhne ko milega Indian cinema me,

Good
Watching this again in 2023. Still had goosebumps 

Mahan movie
Om Raut N Prabhas k career Barbaad kar diya I Hope k Prabhas salaar se comeback kare
Prabhas is a lion..the action role should have been used in a gentle and calm charming character like Lord Ram...Aadipurush's dialogue delivery seemed to be according to his personality...but When did I deliver such a flat face as if I haven't slept since I was a teenager...and the mistake is Prabhas's name...using Saumya and Shant role like Lord Ram, who said what he does...

April 2023
This is how it is trailer
Bahubali 2 is supper Bolkbeaster Very very nice In the actions in film

One of the best films of India ever made! It gives goosebumps to see the trailer even after so many years... 

One of the best movie I ever saw. Next to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;

Bahubali 3:- Shiva takes the decisions of the state while ruling, he is moral but every time Kattappa gives him advice, he starts getting irritated by this and then replaces Kattappa to his son. Kalke's daughter's son, i.e. Bhalla's son, who was living with his mother (had married Bhalla as a gift after losing the war, hence Bahubali was against his mother's decision). During the war, he repeatedly advises to fight like this. Fight like this, just as Shiv is about to kill Kattappa, Bahubali is coming from the front. Shiv gets choked seeing his father but Kattappa tells him that he saw and Shivgamini is coming from the front. End (It was Bahubali's decision to give rule to Bhalla. Bahubali saved Shivgamini from drowning. That's why people were trying to free Devasena from the shackles. Bahubali wanted to free his son but he did not want his brother's death. Further Singhansan But who will rule?) to be continued

<a href="">01:00</a> Can anyone get the idea of ​​where I want this song? bahubali in 3?
Bahubali is a great indian film

10/10

one day I will tell my son  bahubali was our generation hit movie..

No movie in future can be made like this masterpiece ... True film lovers can understand the Efforts made in every single second.. Prabhas was a really good actor and SS RAJAMOULI self can&#39;t made this (RRR) ... We get to know our culture plus songs of the movie have shlokas and sanskrit used in them and a diffrent vibe of rivers and mountains .... Hattss off To the whole Team .. I am proud that INDIA has BAHUBALI ( so underrated)

As child we love bahubali but as adults we understand bhalaaldev more.

Bahubali movie is too good  still one of the best

I am watching this trailer after 5 years 
Best thing I have ever seen in my whole life

Any movie can&#39;t compite bahubali it&#39;s antic piece

Amazing 
Legand are watching 2022

Why did Kattapa kill Bahubali? Biggest question till now
Sharadh kelkar is absolute Legend

Even after 5 year&#39;s of watching it still feels fresh 

infighting
bahubali movie hype and theatre experience is once in life time experience this generation kids don&#39;t know the hype of &quot; why katappa killed bahubali &quot; it is a masterpiece ....

Kgf is the best

Kattapa beta uper ek origin movie honi chahiye expect mahesh babu was kattapa son and because ss rajamouli next movie with mahesh babu than public theatre tot padagayi bhai mera 

Origin for the beginning of  growth the south , not any movie beat bahubali 1 and 2

This movie is just outstanding ️ Never get bored to watch it

As kattappa killed bahubali, sound comes like this:why??? 

Best movie in indian cinema ever...️
