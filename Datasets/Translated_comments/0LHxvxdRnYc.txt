There needs to be Captain Marvel versus Rogue before they dismiss the actress.

Here for The Marvels!



i&#39;m not gonna fight your War i&#39;m gonna End it

Клянусь, ничего хуже не видел, это апогей дна 

Getting sick of movies not just superhero films where the women are the tough masculine ones &amp; the men are running away from the action. Basically pure programming to turn men into women &amp; women into men.  it’s the same now in every film tv series. All these corporations are all linked &amp; programming the young generation. Getting completely dumbed down  can anyone under 20 yrs old read a AZ Road book read a map   Society has gone backwards

The sequel is really fun! Go watch The Marvels while it&#39;s still in theaters

The sequel is the biggest flop in MCU history losing over 400 million LOL

ok

Boreddd

Holy Moly, I miss thoose times too.

Pure cringe. The sequel is a flop too. LOLOL

Prefiro Fury sem a barba

Feels like the character is washed down and weaker now there is three of them what a cheap way to throw a black captian marvel in there

I&#39;m not gonna fight your war I&#39;m gonna end it

I can&#39;t wait until this comes out! I love to watch lesser and weaker versions of the original Superior Heroes we know and love from Marvel Comics. Yeah I know Karen you don&#39;t agree with me, who&#39;s test, whos going to remember any of these actresses that have been shoehorned in because have placed their bets on this trend, of pretending Men &amp; Woman are equal physically. It&#39;s about as ignorant as the WNBA females claiming they should get paid the same as NBA Male athletes? The only reason they don&#39;t get paid as much is because nobody goes to games. They would be get paid the same, if people went to the games. But they don&#39;t end of story. Marvel should have spoken with Bud-Light first. Wait, never mind, Colin Kaepernick the new brand ambassador for Bud Light.  That&#39;s even better yet, they&#39;re going to lose another billion in revenue.

hello there traitor. if you don&#39;t stop all of the superheroes you adore will going to kill you

Still a better Goku then the dragonball movie.. <a href="">1:50</a>



Opening To Captain Marvel 2019 DVD

If this came out in Phase 2 or early 3, people would have loved it. We just wanted something more from a movie released between IW and EG..

Horrible cgi  ... terrible movie! 

Doctor strangenin the red thing on the back is sweet

Love you CaroooolCan&#39;t wait for the marvels 

The marvels here we go

Can’t wait for The Marvels.

So who’s here after the marvels trailer?

best part of the trailer <a href="">2:02</a> 

Honestly this movie sucked I fell asleep the first time then gave it another shot and remembered why I fell asleep

Best...

this was honestly the best movie ive ever watched, the characters, the plot, the cgi, and the songs. everything was perfect.

Watched Black widow just now, really enjoyed it 

Ost

I&#39;d really like to find the music behind this trailer.  I&#39;ve found a couple of similar fan made ones but they&#39;re still not quite like this one.

This movie was the first marvel movie that disappointed me

A tree has more personality than Brie Larson cancel this vapid Karen.

Oh please ! 

Captain Marvel 

Rewatching the 15th time

THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED

Excited for the marvels

Wish she got a proper sequel even tho the marvels is still captain marvel 2

Any connection with avengers

rather eat dirt than watch this

&lt;A rubbish film based on a poor selling comic.&gt;

Captain marvel 

The number one cop and the captain.

This is another leading lady that would be awesome in Miles Morales. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel.

&lt;Film so rubbish it took years to get a sequel. A sequel that&#39;s keeps being delayed.  Brie Larson has the distinction of being the first MCU character to be a supporting   character in her own sequel ha ha ha!&gt;

(HELLYEAH)!

This movie was great, i&#39;m even more excited for endgame now!

&lt;Rubbish film based on a poor selling comic.&gt;

O primeiro filme era decente, e o segundo vai ser horrível.

&lt;The Captain Marvel sequel delayed again because the early test screenings bombed   for the Marvels. The Avengers title won&#39;t be here to pad the sales this time Brie.&gt;

ー＠お＠

&lt;Film was so rubbish it played to countless empty seats. Disney and the shill media   simply released overly inflated sales numbers to hide the flop.  Even Disney knows how rubbish Captain Marvel is that&#39;s why she had very little   screen time in Endgame and her sequel keeps being delayed.&gt;

&lt;Amusing how Brie masquerades as the champion for equality when she stepped   over Monica Rambeau to be Captain Marvel. In the comics the first female Captain Marvel   Was Monica not Carol Danvers. Where is the equality Disney?&gt;

&lt;Captain Marvel is a rubbish character that couldn&#39;t make a profit in comics  no matter how many times Marvel rebooted the character.&gt;

Brie Larson is the best __ love the ownership _ love the presence __ love her voice __ only Joye Saldana comes closer to her

Trailer - IncredibleMovie worse

&lt;Film so rubbish Disney cooked the books to avoid a flop.&gt;

This trailer is better then the movie.

march 2019 captain marvel aprill 26 2019 endgame excellent

Watching in 2023 !! 

I freaking love this trailer  GIRL POWER 

&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on the poor selling comics.&gt;

Captain marvel 2019

Omg banish brie Larson for fk sake

Only way you can hate this movie is if you hate women

&lt;Captain Marvel is so rubbish she needed a team to help carry the show in the sequel. Without Disney cooking the books again The Marvels will flop.&gt;

I actually like the movie. Don&#39;t know why so many people hated it.

Am I the only one who got this recommended?

&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on the poor selling comics.   MCU is a woke dumpster fire made for simpletons.&gt;

Sun Wukong

&lt;You feminists trolls and shills attemping to hype this rubbish film are going to need  many more fictitious accounts to create even the slightest bit of excitement.&gt;

We need more, becuse she just lights up my life, and she&#39;s hot!They really need to do more stories with this character,  maybe her going back to the cree planet. And earth getting the technology for space exploration kind of a sagway to star track.

Garbage ....worst movie of all time

Awesome Movie! Awesome character. Captain Marvel is literally HOT!

Do he je

The most unlikable hero ever

&lt;A rubbish film based on a rubbish woke comic character with poor selling comics.&gt;

হাল্ক এর একটি  নতুন মুভিজ  এক্সপলেইন

You watched Captain Marvel and now you researched the Trailer and Watching again ?

I don&#39;t understand who so many people hate this movie. I can&#39;t understand what&#39;s so sexist about it.<b>Like I&#39;m just a kid and things go over my head</b> Also I hope Captain Marvel is in Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. She was in EndGame but I also want to see her in the two new Avengers movies.

Ela é a Mary Marvel.

&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film promoting more social engineering propaganda   for the occult elite.&gt;

Booooo!!

ازق فيلم

&lt;MCU is woke rubbish made for fools.&gt;

Bro is movie ka Hindi dubbed chahiye

&lt;Even Disney knows how unpopular Captain Marvel is that&#39;s why Brie Larson had very little   screen time in Avengers: Endgame.&gt;

How he actually lost his eye was by the cat

&lt;Rubbish woke feminist propaganda film based on a poor selling comic.&gt;

I mean Filthy Frank&#39;s video about the dark lord returning is significantly better than this trailer.

Real Title: Misandrist Strikes Back... after striking first.

Why is ok to take an artists life&#39;s work and corrupt it so dramatically? How many stories now?Think of your favorite piece of music, is it ok to disrespect the artist&#39;s soul who sacrificed all other lively pleasures and commitments to get said soul onto the page, by changing the notes while keeping the name, just to make a few people who prefer their favorite notes in its place, happy? Most of Life for most of us, is not inclusive. Do we have to destroy every much loved creative cornerstone of Western Artists&#39; storytelling, because its not how the story would go if, someone else wrote it???? JUST WRITE YOUR OWEN STORY, WITH ITS OWN NAME.

Rhonda Rousey next caption marvel brie Larson next rowedy Larson

Coming to here after the Secret Invasion trailer, makes me think we underestimated the Skrulls.

Be advised it is Literally sold in a Store in today&#39;s time.

It is a creature 9 feet tall usually.

You need infrared googles.

It has been trying to eat everyone. That is why we sell it Legally. The AVP attacked in 2009. Literally in my home.

Yeah I helped create it.

Cancer.

Who&#39;s watching trailer in 2022 

Most boring Marvel character ever.

Y el desnudo de Brie Larson?



What I like about her is that she can go to warp in space like a freakin Federation Starship but I think faster. Not even superman can do that! 

Captain Marvel is a DC Comics Character you posers

This was one of the best Marvel movies I watched for the past years, I don&#39;t understand why so many people hate it ??

Qual é o nome dançar

Lame girl power movie starring plank Larson.

&lt;&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;&gt;

<a href="">1:55</a> for this scene I was excited for the movie..but BGM in that scene disappointed me

Female superhero failed

I love this movie

Why not used this music theme song in the movie 

Captain Karen boring movie.

＠＠＠＠

marvel 1

Captain Marvel is a vapid plank of wood.

ridiculous

This could have been the top gun of MCU but alas it turned out to be what it did.

I&#39;m excited for Marvel Studios The Marvels on (2023).

Boring movie with Captain Karen showing us what girl power is all about.

Not me watching old movie trailers..

Poor casting choice. Poor movie. The only reason this movie earned in box office is, because of the hype it created in the end of infinity war! If this movie wasn&#39;t released before endgame it would&#39;ve became an utter flop! brie larson simply wasted the character!

ok so who is she?

The movie was ok but why does the trailers make this movie look good and enjoyable is it just me?

<a href="">0:22</a>Nobel Warrior HeroesNWHNo Way Home

Bland feminist movie with boring story and cheese queen walking around with the same Karen facialexpression the entire movie.

Lame movie made for people with low standards.

So many EMOTIONS. The FEELS are reals. And overwhelming PASSION that surges throughout the story.So... much... WOW!Alright, I&#39;m sorry. Honestly, I like Captain Marvel, it&#39;s a fun watch. A stellar origin story, IMO.

Captain cringe 

Good

super lame movie

Bringing Brie Larson to Marvel was the dumbest decision ever. Captain Marvel is awful.

Super boring feminist action movie led by a plank of wood.

This is such a well-edited trailer &lt;3

Can&#39;t Wait For The Marvels

Super cringy feminist action drama with uninspiring plank acting from Brie Larson. Captain Marvel is truly the worst Marvel movie I have ever experienced with the ridiculously mundanewriting and poor casting decisions. Seriously folks don&#39;t waste a penny on watching Captain Marvel it&#39;s a waste of time.

your life began the day it nearly endedwe found you with no memory, we made you one of us, so you could live longer stronger superior, you were reborn. i keep having these, memories, something in my past is the key to all of this. youre not a flatus thing ? you see. thats a yes or no question ? yes.

Cringe feminist 

MeToo scammer 

NFT scammer 

Elongated forehead  

Cringe queen 

Cringe feminist crap movie.

se quejan del feminismo cuando la pelicula no tiene nada de feminismo, tiene mas de mujer maravilla y es verdad hoy en dia sigue habiendo machismo solo miren los comentarios, puros hombres son los que odian y odian a la pelicula y a la actriz

they complain about feminism when the movie has no feminism at all, it has more of wonder woman and it is true today there is still machismo just look at the comments, pure men are the ones who hate and hate the movie and the actress

the movie has nothing feminist I don&#39;t know where they got it from it&#39;s not the actress&#39;s fault that the movie was bad it&#39;s marvel&#39;s fault for not paying attention to the work of their projects



What is hidden in fury’s eyes ….?you know, the one who is hidden ?

Beautiful

Big thumb down for feminism. 

The best part about this movie was the cat

Thor 3 , avengers endgame, black widow and guardians of the galaxy vol 2 2017 with the eternals 2021 was on streaming from Disney+. From marvel studios movie, captain marvel 1.

Super cringe feminist girl power movie.

i don&#39;t know why people hate this movie i love it although it lacked actions

Who watched spider man no way home... And now watching CAP trailer

&lt;Brie Larson likes to masquerade as a champion for equality, but doesn&#39;t actually do anything to help people.   Brie endorses BLM and racial injustice, but Brie donates her money to racist Margaret Sanger&#39;s eugenics program   called Planned. Parenthood. Brie Larson also white washed Captain Marvel.&gt;

&lt;In 2019 a miracle happened! Captain Marvel is said to have broken records  despite many cinema seats for showings of Captain Marvel being empty.&gt;

Womens arent worth in marvel movies

I actually quite enjoyed the movie. Though I didn’t like Brie Larson’s interpretation of the character because in the comics Cap Marvel is a lighthearted badass beast of a fighter and in the movie she’s unlikeable cocky and corky. But overall I thought the movie was fairly okay 6.5/10

Why does this trailer have so many likes

Feminist movie

Fuera capitana marvel

Feminist driven film with no bother to tell a great story or make characters worth remembering. Whole film is a feminist brainwashing tool. 

Aah..just remembering captain feminazi XD

They talked with You again Odin does not have wings. The Valkaries áre not his Army. Áre You Ok?

I&#39;ve seen the movie five times now and always feel disappointed. They should&#39;ve focused on her story as a Kree warrior learning about their deceit, but that story got muddied by the (not so) revelations about her life on Earth. Goose&#39;s true nature as a Flerken doesn&#39;t fit with the tone of the movie. S/he shouldn&#39;t have been seen as anything other than a cat. The whole tentacle monster in the palm of the hands was too convenient for Fury and Maria, and robbed them of moments of action. Plus it was funnier to think that the Kree and Skrulls were afraid of a simple cat. The Tesseract could have mysteriously vanished and then you have the end-credits scene where Goose coughs it up as a subtle reveal that s/he was in fact an alien. Instead that credit scene goes on way too long for a predictable pay-off. And finally, the &#39;Avengers Initiative&#39;. Not everything has to be a thing. After 11 years and twenty-odd movies, apparently it&#39;s all been about Captain Marvel. Only it doesn&#39;t really make sense for her to be called Captain Marvel (which she wasn&#39;t). Surely it makes more sense for her to be called &#39;Avenger&#39;. This movie should&#39;ve been so much better.

A boring actress in a super feminist movie. Two thumbs down.Brie Larson isn&#39;t even attractive.

Miss you old Marvel. Its really sad how Marvel making stupid movies in phase 4

The trailer&#39;s so good. The movie&#39;s okay for me but it&#39;s up to you if you&#39;d hate it or not

it rocks!

I like to see a series very similar to Roswell ( &#39; 99 - 02 ) having Anya Taylor - Joy , Ellie Bamber age 23 , Luke Newton  or Ehren Kassam , Victoria Pedritti &amp; Gracie Dzienny 24 , Diana Silvers  or Rachel Bilson , Braeden Lemasters , Sorcha Groundsell  &amp; Bel Powley , David Duchovny , Daniel Radchiffe , Joel Courtney or Garrett Ryan 20 , Zendaya &amp; Gage Munroe or Jay Jay Warren or Gage Munroe  or Leo Howard , Natalie Portman &amp; Angourice Rice &amp; Corey Fogelmanis &amp; Finn Roberts &amp; Maggie Gyllenhaal &amp; Kiernan Shipka , Kerri Medders  &amp; Blu Hunt 24 , Mayia Hawke , Rachel Bilson , Ellie Bamber 23 , Taj Speights 22 , Elena Kampouris ) , in the series . I don&#39;t know if they are in similar ages the kids or not those in their 20&#39;s . I like 2 innocent one&#39;s male &amp; female being Corey Fogelmanis &amp; Finn Roberts run a way or make themselves invisible &amp; fly away secretly with 2 females 2 for each male like a adventure love series . Them all being the main Charactors .

กัปตัน​มา​เวลภาค2มีไหม​ครับ​

&lt;This is a boring feminist propaganda film based off Kelly DeConnick&#39;s stupid woke comics.The Carol Danvers comics sold poorly and Kelly even told people who don&#39;t like her politics to not buy her comics.Kelly Sue DeConnick was hired by Disney as a consultant for Captain Marvel coaching Brie on how to portray the Carol.&gt;

these movies have so much cheese in them, if you watch too many you turn into a quesadilla

Is this the feminist bullshit movie?

No more superhero movies Hollywood  I’ve had enough 

Great heroes need indestructible villains...Captain marvel has. None...I came here to put a dislike

I&#39;m Military I do not need a Restraining order in Military court for her.

I do not want her here.

No she is not supposed to be here.

&lt;Rubbish feminist Mary Sue that most comic fans didn&#39;t care for.Captain Marvel is based on radical feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s stupid woke comics.You woke warriors enjoy your new feminist Thor film and Ironheart the woke Iron Man replacement.&gt;

ไม่สนุกเลย

I thought this was a captain marvel 2 trailer

&lt;This is another rubbish woke film from Disney promoting more tokenism. In the comics Captain Mar-Vell was originally male.The Captain Marvel film is based on feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s rubbish comics.Kelly Sue DeConnick was even hired by Disney acting as a consultant on the film. Anyone claiming the Captain Marvel film isn&#39;t feminist propaganda is lying.&gt;

Captain Marvel is my most favourite female character. Who likes captain Marvel like me? Like️

&lt;Drop dead Captain Feminist! You and Kelly Sue DeConnick are nasty misandrists promoting feminist lies.&gt;

Something&#39;s wrong when they make Captain marvel meaning she&#39;s a girl

Super movie

Is this a true story?

A MARVELLOUS MOVIE

&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.

most re-watchable mcu movie love it

LOVED THIS MOVIE

Im going to fight captain marvel

SPACE KAREN! The movie!

Captain Marvel is the best Avenger ever.

ETERNALS.......................

This trailer is worse then her acting

<a href="">1:52</a>

How come was i allowed To cry? How come?

omg️

YouTube, this is not a Spider-man No Way Home trailer.

2 YEARS LATORRRRR

&lt;Two thumbs down for being a feminist Mary Sue based on delusional feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s comics. &gt;



that Annette Benning voice is so mesmerizing

Is like from Disney plus /marvel film with Stan Lee death!. Guardians of the galaxy vol 2,Thor 3 raganrok and black widow!!. Finally marvel new movie in 2021,11 the eternals!.🇺🇲️‍‍

I like this movie. It’s so empowering and inspirational.

What&#39;s funny is I didn&#39;t even know this film existed until now... I&#39;m not really a cinema type of guy but the fact that I never heard about this film might pinpoint how bad its marketing was.Just saying ...

This movie is stupid and booring

Captain marvel is a man in the comic books.  This feminist bullshit is going to far. Movie sucked because of the gender change.  Thumbs down

O trailer: O filme: ️

นี่ ภาค 1 รึภาค 2 คะ

why is this on my recomended

&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film made for stupid people.&gt;

She is one of my favorite character in the MCU

This movie already came out and I still watch the trailer

Today is June 1 2021 and right now I am going to watch captain marvel for the first time ever since it released, why haven&#39;t I watched it, because I didn&#39;t want to, so I am more than 2 years late, can anybody tell me without spoilers, the bad and the good

Got recommended this one... Maybe the &#39;Marvels&#39; teaser trailer is on the way.

Useless. The trailers are not the original

You cannot tell me that Marie and Carol weren’t a lesbian couple

2021 and still watching this amazing trailer

Fury: last time I trusted someone I lost an eye!Me: Lemme get this straight, u trusted a cat and that&#39;s the reason why you got one eye now?Fury: well... yea basically.



yall would complain about her potrayal but never bats an eye when it comes to wanda maximoff, brie larson did an amazing job

Captain marvel and Venom new series

Venom Disney plus 4/8/2018

как же английский язык пафосно звучит <a href="">0:34</a> - <a href="">0:50</a>

You don&#39;t have to watch this movie ,, trailer is enough,,

this movie was a big threat for the incel community

Nick fury in TWS: the last time I trusted someone I lost an eyeThe cat: 

Best movie ️

Decent movie. I hated the way she ran

Captain Marvel was a great film love this Movie and Brie Larson was the perfect person to play Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers

Boring flick

Whenever I absolutely don‘t want to get any goosebumps I watch this movie.

&lt;freddie prinz   =  New Brie Larson channel chat bot troll &quot;Joined Apr 5, 2021&quot;&gt;

I love this movie 5 star

Well gee I can think of a time you could have been helpful in infinity war

Ignore all the PC WOKE LGBTQ  things that bounced around the net about this movie, Captain Marvel IMO is a Good movie, and has some really good action scenes, and fills in Furys back story and Captain Marvels.

This movie reminds me to watch the rest of the MCU movies. This movie is basically from the past played in our future.

best mcu movie

&lt;Oh look it&#39;s Captain Misandry here to take down the make-believe patriarchy.&gt;

Stan the man, Stan Lee forever

Lessons from the movie : 1. Don&#39;t waste your time proving to others 2. Fall seven times stand up eighth 3. Don&#39;t trust on grandmas now a days         No offense just to make it funny 4. Cute things often result being dangerous e.g Goose5. Your weakness can be  your strength.6. Girl power is powerful 7. No one&#39;s gonna help you when you fall you have to get up yourself .8. You are powerful from inside .9. You can be anything you want .

All these superheros, superhero this superhero that...these so call superheros are rally getting boring

Dislikers are Justice league Flop 2016 fans 

Ede Mraşli Yok miiii

&lt;Drop dead Captain Misandry. Such an uninteresting Mary Sue toxic feminist character.&gt;



I suprised how her suit did not melt  I&#39;m  sad now 

Just came back to read comments from insecure men about how badass a woman can be.. lmao what a sad existence they must have.. keep drowning in your tears.. captain marvels a badass

Brie larson is

March 8th- International Women’s Day!(March 8th, 2019)- Release date of Captain Marvel!Happy 2 year anniversary

Just realized today is International Women’s Day, the day this movie was released 2 years ago! Happy IWD to all the beautiful &amp; strong &amp; empowering women of the world &amp; shoutout to the two year anniversary of the release of Captain Marvel️

2021 who&#39;s still here 

This trailer woulda been a lot better with out the noble warrior hero’s part and removing the “I’m gonna end it” thing at the end

Trailer : Excited Movie : Boring

Since when had iron man and scarlet witch a children :)<b>Iron witch</b>

is this the most disliked marvel trailer?

Captain Karen is here to save the day by pushing more feminist narratives. Trash movie and dumb actress.

I didnt like it in cinema but rewatching it at Disney+ I actually enjoyed it more than I did before

Um yeah

Cool

I always loved the bus driver .Edit: and always love him.

A super feminazi with the excitement of a plank of wood.

Carol is such a good role model! She taught me that being dishonorable and that threatening an innocent man’s life and stealing his property is perfectly fine! What a cool 3 dimensional character! I REALLY hope he comes back to lead the avengers!

2019

Marvel, gimme a reason you just recommended this trailer now during WandaVision?

She&#39;s literally the male version of Mark Zuckerberg lmao

&lt;Brie Larson&#39;s Captain Marvel is based on a misandrist comic &quot;hero&quot; created by delusional misandrist feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick. Kelly Sue DeConnick acted as a consultant during filming. The Captain Marvel film promotes toxic feminist propaganda and the fallacy of intersectional feminism. In the Captain Marvel film males are portray as bullies and oppressors who use emotions are weapons against females. In one of the most stupid parts of the Captain Marvel film Brie Larson steals a man&#39;s motorcycle to display her girl power. The Captain Marvel film features Lashana Lynch in a supporting role which proves intersectional feminism is about Caucasian women holding power over women of color while claiming equality for women of color.&gt;

&lt;i loved captain marvellous brie larson was brielliant&gt;

i loved captain marvellous brie larson was brielliant

God this movie was bad. The characters,their development.Everything. Worse of all was the feminism. To quote:Captain Marvel banks on its audience seeing Danvers at the height of her powers to be thinking, &quot;Wow, isn&#39;t it amazing that a woman is just as, if not more, powerful than the men around her?!&quot; It just tries to compare and belittle men with it acting as shallow feminist icon propaganda.&quot;For this and so many other reasons, Captain Marvel&#39;s feminism feels not only like a step backwards, but reactive to the male superheroes long-since established in the MCU&quot;.

This movie sucked.

Its funny that she just gave that woman the BIG OLD PUNCH

2021 Nepal

Trash feminazi movie

Deseo hacer el amor con capitana Marvel

I love it

&lt;Rubbish film made for raging feminists and beta male simps.&gt;

What a foll of crap this movie was 

&lt;And just like that feminism ruined the MCU.&gt;

Una digna pelicula de serie b eso es lo que vi no vale la pena

&lt;Rubbish character promoting radical feminism and the fallacy of intersectional feminism.&gt;

Captain marvel is such a badass character. People who don&#39;t love her certainly don&#39;t have a good taste!

Skrull: This was is just the beginningCarol: I&#39;m not going to fight your wall, I&#39;m going to end it.Skrull: Then it&#39;s a yesCarol: uh?Eitri: Yes, by ending the war you are fighting what it means.

Captain Marvel is legend

Captain marvel fan

Atleast this was better than WW84

Oh nice I was searching from this movie everyday

&lt;Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Agent Carter, Maria Hill  =  Well written charactersCaptain Marvel  =  Uninteresting Mary Sue promoting intersectional and radical feminism&gt;

Is anybody like me Watching movie than trailer!!!

the power of Mar-vell

Bruh this is The Bacon Hair music

Love this movie!

This is really cool 

somebody to love

About 8 gazillion times better than Black Panther

No me digas que se formó la familia &gt;&gt; Iron Man + Viuda Negra = Capitana Marvel (su bebita) Pobre Capitan America (al menos le dieron su nombre, será el ¿tío?) No sé.

movie is over hated . its not great but come on people

This is fake dude cap

Use me as dislike button

I don&#39;t blame Brie Larson for her acting, It&#39;s mainly Marvel&#39;s problem that made me hate this character. I wouldn&#39;t say the dumbest character in the MCU, I would probably say she&#39;s probably the most &quot;useless&quot;. DON&#39;T BLAME BRIE LARSON! IT&#39;S NOT HER PROBLEM!

&lt;The worst MCU character.&gt;

Alita is so much better than this.

Es aburrida es pelicula

I can&#39;t wait to see this movie

&lt; <b>Star-studded Time’s Up charities spent big on salaries, little on helping victims</b>Hollywood’s “Time’s Up” organization, set up to fight sexual harassment — with Reese Witherspoon, Amy Schumer, <b>Brie Larson</b> and other luminaries on its board — spent the bulk of its donations on executive salaries and only a fraction on legal costs to help victims, public records show.The organization, which is comprised of the Time’s Up Foundation and Time’s Up Now Inc., raised $3,670,219 in 2018, its founding year, but spent $1,407,032 on salaries and only $312,001 on the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund for people who have experienced sexual harassment.Charity watchdog groups such as Charity Navigator recommend that non-profits spend 75 percent of their revenues on their mission and 25 percent on administration. Time’s Up spent 38 percent on salaries alone.&quot;&gt;

79k white men aint happy the movie broke all sort of records :)

*Yawn*

<a href="">1:39</a> Oops I almost vomited.

So this whole thing is a lie

Love captain marvel

&lt;When you compare Brie&#39;s poorly written Mary Sue Captain Marvel to well written strong female characters it really shows how pathetic and comical Disney&#39;s effort was.Legends like Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Alice Abernathy, and Princess Leia really make Captain Marvel look silly.&gt;

Thorr is the best character in marvel

<a href="">0:10</a> Why did I laugh

Best mcu film

&lt;Brie Larson enjoys paying lip service about equality but continues to take leading roles away from women of color.&gt;

Who thinks a movie is worth watching? Thank you all for supporting the film.

Somebody Move on But Not us

&lt;The Captain Marvel film promotes the fallacy that is intersectional feminism. Instead of letting a woman of color have the Captain Marvel role Brie Larson took the role for herself while having Lashana Lynch play a supporting role. Feminism has always placed Caucasian women at the prominent position.The Captain Marvel film also promotes the feminist make-believe patriarchy, which in the Captain Marvel film use emotions as weapons.&gt;

I wish captain Marvel will dead

Captain Marvel is beautiful I love

CAPTAIN KAREN~

ไม่ว่าง ทำไมผมทรงใหม่

Am I the only one who does not like captain marvel and her bitchyness attitude especially in endgame?

Ok guys, still here

I Know Who’s The Real Captain Marvel is..️

You are powerful and also a good avengers 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲

I want to see goose on Captain marvel 2 

After watching this movieIf any one ask me that Who is best actress of hollywood? I will definitely answerBRIE LARSON

2020?

This movie should’ve been canceled and burned a million times

Queen carol

Awesome character perfectly performed by Brie Larson

Came back just to say the Black Widow movie still isn&#39;t out and this piece of trash film is the only female lead MCU film. Sorry they did all of womankind dirty like that. You deserve better.

What a lame movie.

Brie Larson does a great job of providing lip service about equality while oppressing men and making sure women of color only play supporting roles.

Many people hate this movie. But I liked it and it&#39;s one of my favorite Marvel movies!

Hey 2K youth, did you know that you are likelier to be a SAG member when you start your own myths?

Captain Marvel: I&#39;m not gonna fight your war, I&#39;m gonna end it.Eitri: Yes that&#39;s what fighting the war means.

mark wiens

Let me tell you something:People were mad that Captain Marvel had small screentime and wish she killed Thanos but if she had more screentime and killed Thanos People would be mad

david dobrik

Can&#39;t believe the fact that Captain Marvel came out on my birthday.....

She’s so overpowered in Endgame about 99% of the superheroes could’ve stayed home...or dead

Boring as hell.

I liked the fact that this film didn&#39;t go over the retreaded origin story of protagonists gets powers, has a struggle to learn how to use them. Then faces an antagonist with similar powers. It was a story about self discovery. Too nuanced for some.

People only hate the movie because of Brie Larson the movie did good but once they saw Brie Larson true colors they didn’t like the movie

Captain marvel definitely has to be in the marvel avengers game

garbage

The black widow trailer is so much better

Hey new trailer of this over credited caption marval with no struggle and with worst personality........ Chutiya jaisa character hai

Carole beskin in this movie ???

Hating captain marvel is not only necessary. It&#39;s a passion, a lifestyle, a reason to get up in the morning. The food for my soul, fire to my loins. Nothing brings more happiness

Happy birthday to you Carol Danvers

Still I&#39;d say Captain Marvel MOVIE was Average even I watch every marvel movie at least 4 times in Theater anyway but literally I didn&#39;t even wanted to Go to watch it for the 2nd Time.And I Think Katherine Langford could play this role better, But anyways She is Gonna play Iron Heart Obviously Tony Stark was the best Iron Man but Iron Man isn&#39;t a name it&#39;s a time title which any genius could take, I know None could replace Tony but it doesn&#39;t mean we not give new faces a Chance! So I&#39;m excited for upcoming projects I&#39;m sure you are too.

I&#39;m biggest fan of brie Larson and all avengers captain marvel and Captain marvel movie is awesome and wonderful and amazing brie Larson is awesome and good best for captain marvel role some people hate him but true mcu fans and all people love him l am very excited for captain marvel 2 one actor lot of struggle for his movie so love actor and actress

I think that this is one of the best trailers of all time whether you like the movie or not. Structure and theme of it is almost perfect. reveals just enough to peak interest.

classic wow

Hi Marvel, I just came here to say that I don&#39;t mind if you guys decide to change actor for Carol Danvers

 because I honestly don&#39;t think Brie Larson fits the job due to her immature impulsive behavior.

I feel like people hate this only because of brei

2020?

This movie sucks

&lt;The Captain Marvel film promotes feminist ideologies of a make-believe patriarchy, which in the film use emotions as weapons against Carol Danvers. Captain Marvel also promotes the fallacy that is intersectional feminism. The film is based off the rubbish comics written by delusional feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick. Kelly Sue DeConnick also acted as a consultant on the film directly coaching Brie on how to portray Carol Danvers.&gt;

&lt;Brie Larson has an army of troll bots trying to hype her dead channel.&gt;

Yeah like i said:^ I like captain marvel at avengers U^U idk why;-;&quot;I just like her lol

I like Carols attitude lol

movie is good but I don&#39;t like actor

I love Captain Marvel.

I love Brie

They really gave this lady a movie before black widow

Bro she sounds like a brat when she says &quot;I&#39;m gonna end it&quot; it&#39;s so cheesy

𝑭𝒆𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒔𝒎  =  𝒎𝒊𝒔𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒓𝒚

I love this movie

Thor : i like this oneChris : i hate this one

I don&#39;t like captain Marvel power because thor is most powerful hero

Honestly, they shouldn’t have even made captain marvel, if y’all like it then that’s y’all, but this is just my opinion

Soo bad

Easily my favourite mcu movie

So many people trash this movie gonna watch it now.

I hate captain marvel they made the dark Phoenix have to change

Billy Batson is the best captain marvel. Change my mind.

Iloveu CAPTAIN MARVEL

Iloveu CAPTAIN MARVEL

At the old lady scene why did they stop Veers attacking her when it was clear the old lady was PSYCHO

Whom do you think is the strongest CAPTAIN MARVEL or THOR?

As a female comic nerd I think you&#39;re not helping yourself by $hitting on white dudes walking around being so smug. IMHO Captain Marvel is a perfect example of a Mary Sue enhanced by deus ex machina driven feminist screenplay.

What an insufferable persona. It is utterly hillarious how all the fans freak out over the bad reviews.

Rip my king 

Y’all be hating on her but she didn&#39;t care all about it.

we not like captain marvel

This movie doesn’t deserve the hate it gets. It’s actually very good!

I think DC should create Captain DC

Literally searched this up just to read comments 

Nick fury is young

Does captain marvel at least make a cameo? So far all I&#39;m seeing is a ms. marvel trailer

It wasn&#39;t awful, but it was one of the five worst movies from the Marvel universe.  Put it this way: had this movie been released as a stand-alone, not marketed as part of being the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it wouldn&#39;t have done that well.  Nothing special about that movie at all.

I love her very much  .  I love her more than wonder woman

It&#39;s one heck of a bad movie. Not up to the expectation of a MARVEL movie.

This shot look fan made <a href="">1:23</a>

This really could have been an epic spy thriller but it was really a below average flim.

<a href="">2:04</a> The Cat is going to destroy this man&#39;s eye&#39;s whole career (I know he isnt a cat)

Why iron man and cap America get more attention the thor and hulk they are more powerful the this 2 humans... Fake war

Me and my dad went to see the movie when it came out since it just happened to be the first movie after infinity war and we thought it was great.I think the trailers dont do as much justice to the film though,they barely even show you who the film&#39;s villains are and all the shots are of captain marvel when she was still a normal human

When you realize that this trailer was better than the movie

slipknot

she&#39;s so powerful that she could kill thanos in infinity war

Can someone please find the original song of this exact trailer?????

Captain Misandrist is here to take down the make-believe patriarchy.

<a href="">02:05</a> <b>Hey! Don&#39;t touch my bling bling!</b>

<b>I was feeling down. I came here to make myself feel better that at least I am not one of the idiots who worships Captain Marvel.</b>

Please Reboot This Movie With A Better Person. We don’t care what changes it will make to the MCU, we will forgive you Marvel ️

Am I the only one who genuinely liked this movie?

Awesome movie

I love Captain Marvel️

anyone here in 2020?

Captain Marvel trailer: &quot;Everything begins with her/a hero&quot; Wonder Woman Trailer: &quot;The future of justice begins with her&quot;  I LOVE IT! I love that both Marvel Studios and Warner Bros. sold the first major solo superheroine movies of their cinematic universes as a very important part of their overall narratives (positioning both women as seminal characters in their superheroic worlds).

Love you my Queen BRIE LARSON 

Brie Larson are drop dead gorgeous

So did she seem light  show glowwy

Captain marvel was a douchebag in endgame

So...? This movie was based on the “Secret Invasion” storyline, right?

This was not bad at all. As a DC fan, I think it was better in a few ways than Shazam. Even if Shazam is the original.

&lt;How did this film break so many records when most seats were empty? And why did Rotten Tomatoes manipulate ratings and have bots posting copy paste positive reviews for Captain Marvel?&gt;

All those empty seats around the world to Captain Marvel showings, yet Di$ney and the biased media claim Captain Marvel broke records. Ha ha ha!

&quot;I do not stand by in the presence of evil&quot;<del>Captain Ma----</del> oooppss wrong movie

Ioad of garbage but not as bad as ghost busters only just

Captain Marvel should’ve been called Ms Marvel like in the comics

Worst character in the MCU. How sad this Mary Sue got her own film before Black Widow.

Captain Marvel: I&#39;m The Strongest Superhero in Marvel UniverseThor: Oh Really? But Why You&#39;re the Strongest?Captain Marvel: Cause I got my Binary Form In my First MovieThor: MARVEL! Bring me my Rune King Form 

I actually think this was a good movie, idk why everyone is hating so much lol [edit] maybe not the best movie but never seen any other marvel movies get so much hate when it’s on the same level

Nick Fury more like Nick <b>Furry</b>

Can someone explain me why captain Marvel is so hated?

Drop dead Captain Misandrist! Kelly Sue DeConnick drop dead too!

Just came her to see why ppl say this movie was trash because of her

I want you can you meet me at the Vadodara Gujarat India

I love you so much

My favorite Avenger after Thor.

The final bit of the trailer with her like just decimating a space fleet is what originally hooked me the first time I saw it. It looks like something ripped STRAIGHT out of a comic book and is absolutely gorgeous.

When I saw captain marvel in endgame I was like &quot;oh is this marvel wonder woman&quot;

Karen Marvel.

Um so the same trailer for movie 1? 

Vgjhgui

<a href="">1:46</a> when I heard that voice I felt like puking.

I feel like marvel  doesn&#39;t give women super heroe movies the same effort as the others.Both this and wonder woman were  boring to watch. Please don&#39;t fail us on black widow

I disliked the trailer back then! Now after 1 yr of endgame back to liking this trailer! 

Migalox : a human hh

Can&#39;t wait to see Captain Marvel 2!

Where is the 2nd movie, Marvel?!?

This movie was freaking awesome - people trashed it. I Loved it from start to finish. Good thing I don’t listen to what other people just say. I judge things for myself. And she seriously should have got way more screen time in End game. However she did blow a ship up in 2 seconds. 

People: Captain Marvel is useless. She shouldn&#39;t be with the Avengers. Wanda and Thor  is much more powerful than her! I HATE HER A LOT!Also People: WhY dId&#39;Nt ShE hAvE mUcH sCrEeN tImE iN eNdGaMe!!

FAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

the movie was bad

Bakwas ha is k part one ka trielar jaHa

78K guys don&#39;t know how to talk to girls.

What I don&#39;t like about captain marvel is she is was thor was when he first came to MCU. Basically a dumb meathead. Hopefully they came add some life to her character like they did with thor.

Disney took a male comic character Captain Mar-Vell and feminized him. How is this empowering women?

Does she age at all after not being seen for 20+ yearsAnyone got an answer please

Trash movie

Meh , her face is -_- all the time , is this acting now ?

This is the most lame character in MCU and if you think I said that because of the gander , congrats you are a sexist

If captain marvel has a one hater than I am the one. She is just irritating 

It’s like she is actually fighting an old lady and not a scroll in the beginning.

Captain Marvel: <b>stonefaced</b>Yon-Rogg: CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS GOD DAMNIT

Shazam!

Name flerkin dangerous highName human dangerous 0 

WHY tf No one TALKIN &#39;BOUT the Fact THAT SHE IS TOO OVERPOWERED LMAO...I THOUGHT SHE WOULD WIN FIGHT WITH THANOS ALONE..

Brie Larson is best for playing captain marvel role.I don&#39;t care what other people say about her.

You&#39;ve searched for captain marvel 2 didn&#39;t you?

Captain Mar-Vell was male until delusional misandrist feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick feminized the character.

I love brie LarsonMy true love

Forgettable.

Captain marvel is most powerful hero..

<b>sigh</b> can we please stop putting incompetent, mindless, failures of human beings in charge of making movies

She is soo overpowered

i think avengers end game is the best movie of marvel entertainment.

<b>Feminists</b> : We don&#39;t need men!<b>Reality</b> : Feminists keep hijacking masculine franchises and characters.

Brie Larson is literally like one of these early 2000s actors on one of those Disney movies

Chick power :)

the movies black widow and captian marvel literally show us that women can do everything

I am going to have to pass.

2 lakh

2 lakh

is it just me thats thinking back on infinity wars end credits scene when cap marvs sign appears and we all thought she&#39;d save the day but was in endgame for like 6min

Disney took a male comic character Captain Mar-Vell and feminized him. How is this empowering women?

Imagine likening this movie

But they cant beat corona

Good trailler

This movie tells me to not trust grandma

It’s not woke enouth ! Captain Marvel MUST be a black transgender femal with blue hairs an a T-shirt « the kids for Biden » ! And see/he/them must have an Habdicap !!

Mannnn I can’t help but think about Black Widow and Dark Phoenix all in comparison

<b>Old Marvel comic fans</b> :  But the original Captain Marvel was male in the comics.<b>Feminists</b>  : Ugh, misogyny!

Now the we have a captain marvel woman let’s make wonder woman a transgender male to female



My grandma becomes strong like that when I don&#39;t eat her food till it doesn&#39;t comes out of my mouth

Just watched the movie and i understood how the main character was bland, but fans are idiotic for relating this movie to feminist propaganda

&lt;I know Captain Marvel&#39;s weakness. --Glut exercises.&gt;

I remeber how hyped everyone was in this movie but in my opinion they should have just made a live action remake of Scarlet witch instead of this one no hate,

I regret saying that this movie was actually slightly dope

Disgusting

Not in this trailer: A cat

Vi

This movie is actually very good and entertaining! Prove me wrong.

Wonder woman&gt;&gt;&gt;Cap marvel because Gal gadot&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brie larson

Worst Marvel movie ever makes zero sense with the time line of the MCU. The acting could’ve been better and more real, but it was almost like Brie had to try harder then everyone else. Even the kids had better acting for Christ sakes.

Captain Marvel only got one movie before Endgame and she is &quot;the strongest hero&quot; but I&#39;m so glad the real hero in Endgame was Iron Man, the oldest one

I was really happy that Ben Mendelsohn finally got to play a good guy for once. Cause he played two bad guys before this movie came out.

Delete this film pls

I dont like women super hero 

garbage movie!

Goodness as if the 1st wasn’t boring enough 

Please make a captain marvel 2

Daniel Craig as silver surfer definitely marvel would give treat for audience...

Well, that’s just lazy writing

What a major disappointment

Not good movie it sucks

does anyone know about soundtrack of this trailer?

I&#39;m in love with this character..

The movie wasn&#39;t bad, but it can&#39;t beat battle angel Alita

captain marvel the hero we didnt need

Thanos:I am IneVitaBle! Capitain Marvel:I Am a JoKe tO yoU?

Captain marvel please help me im in trouble ahhhhhhh

This trailor always gives me goosebumps

Captain Marvel is so faboulous! 

People actually liked this garbage? Friend made me watch it and I was utterly bored through the whole film

I think this movie would’ve worked if it wasn’t told from the perspective of captain marvel and had the other characters try to get her on their side, or focused on her slowly learning what the right side to be on is.The reason being that the character is too powerful to be an simple action hero like the other marvel characters, and the story needs to factor her power into the story. What side she’s on is the crux of the movie, but it’s not fully explored so it doesn’t work as well as it could.

I hate these capers hero movie. I don’t get it .

I never thought Captain Marvel was a bad film. I actually loved this film and I love Brie Larson. Anyone agree?

Dear Disney: Ruby Rose please...!

captain marvel should have died in avengers endgame instead of tony.

Why women should not have superhero movies.

-Most Movies The Strongest Hero Is A Woman X-Men, Avengers, Superwoman Even The Head Of Disney Is A Woman️

<a href="">1:54</a> how are you not impressed by that?! that looks amazing!

Skrill are not Noble warriors

I love marvel

That should of been Gina Carano. Look at her in The Mandalorian - it&#39;s beautiful !

How many Captains are their?

This is the hottest woman alive

No matter how many times I watch this trailer and movie, I’ll never get bored. The CGI is incredible!

I thinked it was captain Maravilla,DC Universe white Superman you know.

I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t like this movie, I loved it

Underrated movie

Any body have full movie link pls send

10 times better than the first trailer

Did you know?The guy who play Wade Hebert from GTA V is in this movie

Anyone in 2020??

So captain marvel is the captain of all heros in the MCU? Even captain america or is he just a captain of US, NA/SA?

Can we all agree that without her powers she’d be the most useless avenger

As easy and fun it is to dunk on people who are still mad about Brie Larson, there are some actors that would straight-up ruin the MCU for me if they were included, lol.

yeah! this trailer is enough. No point seeing the movie.

So rad!!!!

I wish she could do more in the endgame then what she was doing that stuff was okey.

One of the many movies I am happy to not watch

I keep having these ..’memories? ?

Superman will knock captain marvel

Some people stop watching trailers after the movie.

But not us

Even i watched it already..i still come for the trailer because i cant move on with <a href="">1:51</a>

Ellen Ripley from &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and Sarah Connor from &quot;The Terminator 2&quot; cry over the image of a strong woman Carol Danvers, shame on you Сaptain Мarvel.

Marvel super hero comics/movies are mainstream audience garbage. The most politically correct comic books on the market today, and the worst.  If you want the really good marvel comics then buy the older ones. Marvel today doesn&#39;t create cool comics for the geeks who like that sort of thing.  Marvel today is mainstream. It a propaganda machine used to brainwash the mainstream masses.

Best Marvel movie of the year: Change my mind.

She&#39;s like jubbilee

Marvel: <b>makes a movie for Captain Marvel</b>Scarlet Witch: Am i a joke to you?

Better watch out, I thought she is MISS Marvel  &amp; Wiki say No, CAPTAIN Marvel. OK!

Pretty good Captain Marvel, thanks to Brie&#39;s performance, She made me laugh in &quot;Endgame&quot; by DETROYING THANOS&#39; Spaceship as a Cookie.... L.O.L &amp; answering &quot; What have you done to Fury and Human Kind,?&quot;

Better was a man not a girl...

I like this Women!

Thor is the powerful avenger He is my favorite

This movie was so boring to the point that if it was a pet I would have put it down by now.AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT&#39;S STAR IS A WOMAN.But best CGI of the year to be fair.

Impressive ! Film

We want captain marvel 2 trailer

Hit  Like if u vote Emilia Clarke for better actress

Una pésima película, con una actuación nefasta de la actriz principal y unos efectos especiales del siglo anterior.

I am looking for Captain Marvel 2

The Wonder Woman 1984 trailer was better than this movie

Just came back to see all the haters who are still mad at one of the three with billion dollar films (Captain Marvel, Black Panther, and Spider-Man). Let it go, y’all look bad still hating

Who else thought this was captain marvel 2?

The cat chases a mouse that triggers ant man&#39;s worm hole truck for him to comeBack to give the idea on going back in time he tells the avengers and then the avengers laterKill thanos.

Captain Misandry.. This kunt is a real LOSER .  Cant act either

ugh i love these captain marvel trailers. honestly tho, black widow teaser trailer didn&#39;t give me as much goosebumps as cap

Ayer hizo un año el trailer XD

Who is here after The Black Widow trailer

Who&#39;s here after the Black Widow trailer?

It&#39;s been 1 year️

In Loving Memory Of Stan Lee(12/28/1922-11/12/2018)

This video was adzactlay 1 year ago from now 3rd of dec 2018 today 3rd of dec 2019

Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) is hot.

Any one after black widow teaser  like here

This movie sucks and it&#39;s hard to watch.

While a lot of people hate her, Brie is VERY popular in the LGBTQ community

Tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of this 

GREAT MARVEL STUDIOS &#39; CAPTAIN MARVEL - TRAILER II !!!!

I knew people would come back just to hate on this trailer again. Don&#39;t y&#39;all have anything better to do?

Must be from the heart (Black Jesus)

R.I.P Black Widow. Never forgotten ! Captain Marvel ...go fast and go low. Geez.

Captain marvel: I’m not gonna fight your war I’m going to end it 2 seconds later..... shows her fighting

&lt;I would have paid good money to see Thanos squash Captain Marvel&#39;s head.&gt;

captain coochie, coochie power femenist punch!

So, I eventually got around to watching this today and i found it to be mediocre at best. However the star of this movie was the cat. After all the hype about a master piece and box office hit, I found 1950&#39;s B movies to be more entertaining than this!! Make a movie about the cat next time!!!

I can see why people hated this movie, yikes

Warning Spoilers: First off this movie is awesome. Brie Larson is excellent as Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers and of course, you get to see a young Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) and the DE-aging effect is amazing, and we get to see Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) return in a movie as well. Then you have Jude Law who plays Captain Marvels mentor Yon-Rogg who did a great job and then you have Ben Mendelsohn who plays Talos/Keller and he was great, then Gemma Chen who plays Minn-Erva and she was good as well, not familiar with her character but I thought she did great and also not to Familiar with most of these characters even Captain Marvel but since the MCU has gotten a lot of this right in their other movies I trust them. The one thing I was kind of disappointed was that the Skrulls were not the villains. It was Yon-Rogg and his crew that ended up being the bad guys I remember when I was watching Fantastic Four the animated series the Skrulls were bad guys and that&#39;s how I have known them to be, so I was expecting them to be the bad guys in this movie, but what they did was pretty good. There are so many different versions of this character and they went with Carol Danvers which I liked but I also like how they have two of the other Captain Marvels in this movie one before and after her Who is Mar-Vell(Before) played by Annette Bening and Monica Rambeau(After) as a kid played by Akira Akbar Now lets talk about everyone’s new favorite feline goose the cat…, I mean Flerken. This Character is awesome and one of the coolest and stand out characters in the movie, the scene I love the most is when one of the Kree puts a mussel on goose and Nick says “It’s a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.” one of my favorite scenes and lines in the movie, and I also like it when Goose goes Flerken on everyone and then you realize why everyone is scared of him, this movie also delves into Nick Fury’s past a little bit too before he becomes director of Shield and explains how he got the eye patch and how he wants to start the Avengers Initiative. I forgot to also credit Lashana Lynch who plays Carol&#39;s best friend Maria Rambeau she was excellent as well. The other thing I noticed while doing research for my review watching clips and stuff that I totally forgot they brought in Ronan The Accuser, which is pretty cool maybe he will be the villain in the next Captain Marvel movie if they continue off of this movie if they do a sequel.  because Ronan says “We will be back for the weapon” and a guard says “The Core” and he says “The Woman” I would like to see what they would do with that, but it might be kind of confusing to do that. Oh well, we will just have to wait and see what they have planned for us. And the fight between Captain Marvel and the Supreme Intelligence also played by Annette Bening was awesome. And Djimon Hounsou reprises his role as Korath The Pursuer we first saw his character in Guardians Of The Galaxy he was the first one to Interact with Star-Lord. He was the one who said who when he asked Star-Lord who he was and Star-Lord told him. He had a bigger role in this movie and I thought he did great, researching stuff and watching clips on YouTube makes me remember this stuff almost forgot he was in it until I saw him in one of the clips. Anyway, this movie is awesome, The actors are great, the story is great, special effects are amazing, directing is great, music is great and Goose is awesome. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. This movie is Cinematastic Oh I almost forgot Stan Lee’s cameo was great and the opening title was so sad but it was great that they made a tribute to Stan Lee. rating 5/5

Wack actress and horrible movie

Best thing about this is that even with so many people still crying about the movie and bashing it with excuses just as an excuse to hate Brie Larson, that makes it all that much sweeter since she signed a 7 picture deal and ain’t going nowhere for a long time lol

Marvel Studios: Alright people we need a movie that single handedly ruins one of the best Marvel villains the Skrulls by making them friendly, destroys Nick Fury&#39;s gravitas and mystery, and totally screws up the continuity of the Tesseract.Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck: <b>HoLd OuR bEeRs!</b>

brutti bastardi non è il film italiano! smettetela di sparar minchiate!

Wonder woman&#39;s trailer is far better than this whole cap mar shitty.

Marvel doesnt know how to keep a overpower hero, if he does only to forget him the whole movie or to become him a joke and weaklingExample: thor and hulk

I literally fall asleep in the theater watching this, my friends just woke me up in the climax part 

Q asco de pelicula

So what happens with black Panther,spiderman,ant man,dr strange,Thor and Hulk.

Wonder woman is better

Fiasco de pelicula Por eso no tuvo exito cambian capitan el original  por una mujer no es igual! todo por el feminazi hasta cuando se dara la mujer dolida por vencida?

Wow. I&#39;m gonna puke. 30 sec in and I&#39;m out.

Garbage picture by a idiotic femcel

Lots of knuckledraggers here who can&#39;t handle a female superhero.  Watch your futures end!  From: THE ONE-ABOVE-ALL!

Honestly captain marvel is the worst movie in mcu

Captain marvel 2 ?

my favorite female character ever

I love Captain marvel but i hate Brie larson.

I love the movie

Gio

This movie box office more than 1 billion usd

Captain Marvel sucked!!!

The funny part about captain marvel is I met her the year her debut came in I’m like wow the first ever super hero for that to happen to me what made it legendary meetin this pretty doll

So this movie is better than Joker?Uh...

Ok, I know people don’t like this movie but how does it have a lower audience score than Uglydolls?!

Honest  opinion this movie was not that good , but because of  affliation with the avengers movies it was a box office

Captain Marvel will always be Shazam in my eyes!

Is this movie for 40 year olds?

The personality i want to see on captain marvel are like on the comics not that stiff, emotional, has that sense of leadership thats the reason why captain marvel was one of my favorite superhero. This version of captain marvel was like a monotone adult talking with no sense at all.

&lt;I was really hoping to see Thanos squash Captain Marvels&#39; head like a grape.&gt;

Trash

Possible shittiest movie in mcu

Go woke, go broke! No one wants to se Captain Marvel as a villain or a biggot. I like the pornversion better.

One of the most stagnant characters in the mcu.

Drop dead Captain Misandrist. Even Disney admitted Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue, who could have stopped Thanos in Infinity War all by herself.

some people forget this movieyeah it&#39;s me

This reborn Brie Larson is what i hated the most

I&#39;m from future and this film was a mess 

But jean grey is strongest.

I Wish For Captain Marvel 2

I won&#39;t even watch this abomination for free

I just wished I watched this first before Avengers: Endgame. Nevertheless, the movie was great! Love you Brie Larson 

See you next Thursday.

Who watched rise of the dark peonex

<a href="">1:15</a><a href="">1:15</a>

Captain Marvel 2:  HR Needs to talk to you

A rubbish propaganda film based on feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick comics.Of course this film ignores the fact that Carol got her powers from a male character Captain Mar-Vell.Disney even admitted that Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue, who could have stopped Thanos all by herself in Infinity War.

They could have asked superman to come in marvel movie, why did they create another superman copy, there are plenty of supermen now.

No Captain Marvel for phase 4 until 2022? Shocking!!!! Must have been something to do with not being able to piggyback off of Spiderman since he&#39;s out of the MCU!

Wroast superhero movie ever

I came to this trailer to just say...Woke bullsheeeeeeet

Captain Misandrist is here to take down the make-believe patriarchy.And a skinny Jewish woman will show men what a real Thor looks like.Disney is a tool used by the globalist elite to promote their social engineering propaganda.

Captain garbage

We know the reason how fury lost his eye 

Peoples said she didn&#39;t play big roles in Avenger Endgames, so who save Iron man before he died from starvation? who explode Thanos&#39;s ship before it kill all of them? Captain Marvel.

I don&#39;t understand why they chose such an ugly and unattractive actress

Is anyone else seeing a complete supergirl rip off in captain marvel?

I love marvel so much. I’m known for being the biggest marvel fan in my family and friend group. But this movie disappointed me. I thought it was boring and to much talking. (Not to mention black widow should’ve had a movie first)

Not gonna lie cartoon captain marvel was better than this one

Can we all agree that this movie SUCKS and only made money because it was the last movie before Endgame?

I really truly hate her character. I don&#39;t hate her because she&#39;s a woman, or because she&#39;s powerful, or even because she was able to take on Thanos without any problem. I hate her because she was made just to show &quot;women power&quot; in the MCU, which was already displayed perfectly. I love Black Widow&#39;s character, and she is just as tough as Captain Marvel, however she wasn&#39;t made just to please the sensitive feminazis online.

Oh God, this is one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen! And I have already watched it twice 

I am not gonna fight your war I am gonna end it... This line was in the trailer but I didn&#39;t find it in the movie

Shazam

Thats a weird looking kitchen

I cried watching this trailer.The special effects &amp; music are so emotional.

I watched this movie but the actors really soo funny and doing many dummy moves.Also she is so proud of being captain marvel and we can see that even in the movie.I think the movie could look more professional without this actor and also the actors show up again in endgame and also she act funny like always and try to force her self to look better than all the marvel heroes.I think I can help with correct this mistakes to make the movie look much better and stronger.

Her character rocks in ENDGAME.

Im an oji-cree

This new Wonder Woman Movie looks great

Here waiting for Black Widow trailer

Powerful useless avenger

Nerds  still hurting after the success of this film.

Captain marvel my favorite avenger

Until now..i cant find this scene (<a href="">0:49</a>) in the movie

Yet another Mary-Sue-character that can do everything like a pro for no special reason (SW fans might feel rey-ish) und it seems the character only exists to...to...be the bettet woman?It‘s not Ghostbusters 2016 bad, but not worth watching either.

Burada Türk yok muuuu ¿¿¿

Chills. Literal chills. Every time.

Brie Larson is the worst thing that has ever happened to Marvel Entertainment.   My choices for her replacement in order of preference:#1  Candace Owens#2  Ivanka Trump#3  Rihanna#4  Jennifer Lawrence#5  Amanda Seyfried#6  Emma StoneTRUMP2020  IVANKA2024-2028

This is all so boring.. haven’t watched a marvel movie in more than 3 years.. thank god. They are all sooo boring.. only mindless kids can sustain this amount of nothingness..

Second lesson is to strong women. When you know you are strong, you have nothing to prove.

The greatest lesson in this movie is do not judge people by how they look, even if you think they are different or ugly.

The greatest lesson in movie is do not judge people by how they look, even if you think they are different or ugly.

Fury lost his eye because of a space cat lol

SSJ CAPTAIN MARVEL<b>WHO KNEW</b>

Captain Marvel: I&#39;m not going to fight your war... I&#39;m going to end it.<b>Eitri: yes, that&#39;s what fighting a war means</b>

Love the movie, love Brie and love those who made Samuel L. Jackson look young 

Made up movie.this is another green lantern.Deadpool should kill this character

I thought she is the most powerful Super Hero, but she didn&#39;t even sustain one Punch of Thanos. 

Which is less?Captain Marvel&#39;s screen time in Endgame or Joker&#39; screentime in Suicide Squad?

stunning and brave

Most strongest avenger ever

Here we go .....any way i would tell you on Chrome

Ready??

This line...now when i play the video

This movies intense they definately hired a cute one as well can’t wait to meet her at Ace comic con

i love this movie

Movie is crap

Do not let this distract you from that fact that red sparrow is a better movie then captain marvel

I hate mainstream audience movies.

Now ive watched all the food scenes in the hole movie

Captain marvel is the personification of white privilege

This story line is completely WRONG! Captain Marvel was not a woman. And the powers that she has did not come from an explosion of any energy source. They were passed to her from the true Captain Marvel so this whole movie is a lie just to make money and to feature that female. Tell the truth, its more accurate than the lies from an untold source. Just like this bat woman coming out. Barbara let it go and became a police detective. Don&#39;t try to make a hero just to make money and sell a movie.  WRONG on many levels!

hi

Even after watching Captain Marvel and Endgame several dozen times, seeing Carol go binary in the trailer still gives me the same chills and excitement that it did seeing the trailer for the very first time. I absolutely love it!

Captain Marvel is a woman!?SKIP

Great movie ever ...hello from malaysia..

Quem veio pela área marveeel!!!

I&#39;d like to see them bring the original Captain Marvel back to life.

Wonder woman is better.

<b>I searched up captain Karen and this popped up</b>

Wait so... She&#39;s the captain of marvel???

Bad movie horribly written

You can say what you want, but this movie is epic

Honesty here. Do fans of MCU hate Captain Marvel more than Thanos? From what I see in this comments section I see they do.

That was f*cked up of showing the staff the trailer of being hyped of captain marvel the day that it shown of the nfl at night. And all the way from 7 months or 8 months i show the only staff the captain marvel trailer before the super bowl. And i was crazy of doing the vocal vox of her. With her dialogues. That&#39;s why i was fond of that.

Whose here after<b>Dr.strange madness of the multiverse</b>

Get her out of Marvel cause everybody seems doesn&#39;t like her. We need a new Supergirl people. She really suits that character. DC plz grab her ASAP.

Who is most beautiful Captain marvel      black widow Like                            comment

all you guys isn&#39;t it obvious, the cat scrathes fury&#39;s eye and at the end he has to pick a prothesis. you only get a prothesis when the original is gone or to badly damaged. yes the cat did that and yes the cat is a FLIRKIN.

&quot;&quot; Im gonna end it &quot;&quot; that was alittle cringy for me

Worst of all the marvel films!

Can someone explain why some people have a problem with Brie Larsson?

I really wanted to like her. But she just has this smugness to her and her energy is so different from all the other superheroes. Also way too overpowered to root for.Tbh this character would work much better as a villain.

another terrible superhero movieevery punch she throws makes me dong reverse into my body further

I hat box-office now, all heroes or carracters become a female.

This movie is garbage  useless

Brie larson is naked in production of marvel studio captain marvel

ARE YOU A SOY BOY OR SOY GIRL OR SOY (ALPABHET) THERE IS A NEW SUPER HERO MUCH MUCH VERY MUCH MORE POWERFULL THAN CPT MARVER HE´S NAME IS ...MOUNTMYBA NANANANANA NANANANANANANANA NANANANANANANANAMOUNTMYBA NANANANANA NANANANANANANANA NANANANANANANANAMOUNTMYBA NANANANANA NANANANANANANANA NANANANANANANANAMOUNTMYBA NANANANANA NANANANANANANANA NANANANANANANANA WATCHOUT FOR MOUNTMYBA!

Brie &amp; Sam Jackson are the best thing in this film, but I don&#39;t like that directors &amp; writers make this film to be like a GOTG spin-off. (Like Rogue One in Star Wars) Hope her sequel is truly her film.

I haven’t seen this movie yet, but now I am really a Marvel fan!  The special effects are amazing 

Who else searched up “cringe trailer” and found this second only to the bat woman trailer

So people hated on this but honestly speaking, it was one of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen.

Oh come on can’t even hold a movie by herself she sucks disney don’t pass to her she sucks

Still the most worthless avenger on the team

Glad I didnt waste my money on this shitty movie.. this movie sucks. Bye I&#39;mgonna go watch a movies worth watching.. iron man and wonder woman.

يخبل   

   

The whole movie is honestly a cringe salad.The script and specifically the dialogue are super juvenile.

when you want to be a nazi

Fake

She makes me crazy hard omg  ladies no dis respect but she&#39;s mine

Everybody like captain marvel Nobody likes Brie Larson 

I am just happy the cat is alive ️️️

Never seen a woman that stronkk

I think she is not girl?

Crapton Marvel...

The trailer makes me hype now then before,

Avengers 4 new

I don&#39;t why captain marvel reminds me of green lantern.If captain marvel be a success why not green lantern If made correctly.

Kree Jafa from Stargate!!!!

پەکوف لەو درۆیە ئەوە باتمان بوو یان ژن

Bet They are gonna make a new Black Widow Movie since this one succeeded.

OK let me make it clear to everyone that hate Brie Larson or the character that she play one think that you need to know about me I&#39;m not that type of person that is crazy of celebrities but if I&#39;m crazy for one then it is because the have a good heart and I will always Stand by captain marvel is side because the things that she say only few people that has a good heart will understand what she was talking about for example who remember about the part where all the females were together in end game and most of the male audience won&#39;t happy with it but then when all the men where together in avengers nobody wrote negative comments so my question is what happen to women&#39;s rights and when someone like brie Larson is trying to open everyone else&#39;s eyes then now everyone are hating her try to understand brie Larson message before hating her she just want that every females should have the same right as men it so funny that the people that always talk about the truth are the one that get hate what a shame

I just bought my dvd copy of this movie today. ;)

For there next movie they should do rogue and captain marvel

Thank you veeery much

Trailer is better than movie.

So you can live longer...Stronger....MORE SUPERIOR  line gives me the chills with the music 

Captain America: I’m the first avenger!Captain Marvel: Hold my photon blast.....

marveltards and they garbage

&quot;Hey Peter Parker&quot;

“i do not stand by in the presence of evil” is by far the best line came here after watching alita and this is like mehh so cringyyy

who&#39;s herre after nedgame

Future is way too soon for your hunger than wait for life.

It is no way future took so long then wait is to continue wait and complain whole day long.

felt like i saw the whole movie in the trailer

I loved this movie. who else liked it

Avanger: End Game ️Captain Marvel ️Spiderman: Far From Home 

I have to admit, after watching endgame I was looking forward to this movie, after watching it I think its pretty terrible, nowhere close to the standard marvel set with ragnarok, infinity war and endgame

What the hell is a noble warrior hero

Im not gonna fight your war im gonna end it- captain marvel 

she looks like a combination of demi lovato,cersie from got and clark from the 100

If Rogue messed up Captain Marvel, how did she regained her powers back? 

Furry is a nerd

Ming2

I saw some classic car

You follow our decision on Earth you obey our way to live you follow in whatever way know nothing follow the maker decision.

and if u think this land in 1882 is in a new land of chainin a trailer 2 is  called kaboom!!!!!!!!! so lets see what kboom  is gon 2 say today  can i pleass put it on,,,

If Thanos would have fail to get the stones, Captain Marvel could have easily defeat him alone...

&quot;im gonna end it&quot; the tone just made mi vomit

Udah liattttt

Captain Misandrist is here to take down the make-believe patriarchy. Of course a feminist who did nothing to help the Avengers earned a spot in Endgame. And Disney changed the fact that Carol gets her powers from a male character Captain Mar-Vell to Carol getting her powers from an Infinity Stone.The original Captain Marvel was a man in the comics.The shills like Kieron Campion are still trying to hype this rubbish film.

capitan twatvel

They could&#39;ve expanded the Black Widow franchise, but they just HAD to make another shitty cliche character, she&#39;s literally just superman and ironman combined, nothing that special. We need you Stan Lee.

Dont understand why people hate her

what if this takes place when thanos died the Ronan want  to destory the infinity stones to keep the avengers from ever getting the stones

You know Brie Larson is terrible when she was outperformed by a CGI cat named Goose.

do you marvel at this discourse, and laugh, and do not you weep?

She’s a painfully bad actress. Who decided to let her ruin the MCU ‍️

Because you can wait we do less and slowly have little thing not more.

They couldnt stand not having their superman(girl)

Came here after watching alita battle angel and we all can agree that it&#39;s better than cap Marvel

Anyone here after watching Spider Man: Far From Home?

Just came here to dislike the trailer.

Đến đây từ Người Bí Ẩn 2019

Powerfull but useless

My power, my way to rule.

I have destroy my phychic ability no signal live normal no intruder to my phychic.

Green Lantern was black also, (at least 1 of them was).1 half or Powerman &amp; Ironfist also, the other , Oriental. (cant remember which was which). How about making films of some of these Superheroes or is the idea just not white enough.?

When I read the comics, the Captain Marvel I remember was black. Why did they make the film of white Captain Marvel.? Is equality a woman 1st, then a black woman 2nd, or even,  not at all.?What say you about that, Samuel Jackson.?

Amo a Cqpitã Marvel

Le film complet sort quand?

Such a shitty movie

This movie is so lit! I need a part two of this 

<a href="">0:24</a> is why im here... What about you?

Boo

We need much more superhero female- led movies! This one was amazing! The effects are incredible!

Yeahhhhhhhh budddyyyyyyyyy, the cat is what blinded fury in one eye

Hi

the scene at <a href="">0:49</a> would have been cool in the rescue mission in the beginning

Most overrated movie ever

she&#39;s hit a grandma on a train Got be badass ‍️

Considering the fact how much screen time she got in endgame. I felt this movie useless

Why u soo beautiful capt

I have seen the movie recently and I really think it is a kind of good introduction for the character of Captain Marvel for Avengers Endgame

Worst movie ever made from Marvel. Very disappointing.  I&#39;m a huge fan of all Marvel movies and this is the first time I&#39;m disappointed.  The plot was boring and the effects terrible.  The acting  was awful.  The only entertaining piece was Samuel Jackson and the cat!

Not recommended don&#39;t watch except u like a full Barny cheap jokes movie

Ama

It&#39;s amusing how any person who doesn&#39;t like this film is called a misogynistic troll who&#39;s afraid of women.Feminism is a women&#39;s supremacy movement promoting misandry hiding behind claims of gender equality.If feminism is about gender equality why are former female feminists and women speaking out against the lies of feminism?

Captain marvel full movie hindi dubbed this link



What if when she punched the old lady the old lady said OWWWWWWWWW wth

The Captain Marvel feminist comics sold poorly no matter how many times Marvel rebooted the character.That&#39;s the reason why Captain Marvel showed to many empty cinema rooms around the world.Disney used ghost screenings and deceptive mass media disinformation articles to falsely inflate sales numbers for Captain Marvel.The evidence of how popular this film is isn&#39;t hard to find.Videos and pictures of mostly empty cinema seats for Captain Marvel.Rotten Tomatoes put limitations on audience score and deleted thousands of comments.Disney even knows how terrible the Captain Marvel character is, which is why Captain Marvel had very little screen time in Avengers: Endgame.

Gw ksini cuma lihat kocheng oren punya captain Marvel ,itu doang gk lbh

this is so amazing supper amazing

You’d think they would’ve made her get in shape for this movie. Or maybe filled her suit out better. She flat as a board.

Please provide name of last 20 seconds music

Who is here to listen to the background music?

Worst choice for captain marvel. She can&#39;t fight, she can&#39;t walk, she can&#39;t even act.

When did she become a captain?

i saw it and its cool

Thx to the movie i hate cats even more then before the movie

The lunch box is missing in the trailer ???

The movie is awesome. Me and my children loved it

Every time I see the trailer, it gives me goose bumps, wanna see that move bad!!!

The trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice

She said that she is gonna end it ...But she didn&#39;t ..Ironman and Black widow

Why isn&#39;t Captain Marvel one of the first Marvel films?

I think Jean is more powerful

Iya 2220012

Who&#39;s here after endgame

It would of been way way better had captin marvel been a man.

dc&#39;de bulunan şu yarı kaslı adam var ya hani süpırmen diye okunuyo, heh işte ondan. aklınızda tutun onu, şu kadınla yan yana getirin. süpırmene ne kadar benzemiyo değil mi?

Time to say goodbye to MCU...

THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE

Entities who&#39;m mastered every aspect of vibrations frequency and matter to revolve around a constant perpetual cycle of the evolution Technological advancements condemning the universe to ultimately being consumed of it&#39;s resources planet after planet left depleted of the means for it&#39;s inhabitants to survive

What a shitty movie thank goodness she wasn&#39;t in Endgame except for a few minutes. Please don&#39;t ever ever make a sequel.

So, after being a male all my life, now Captain Marvel is a transgender.....He&#39;s now a woman?

Re-watching trailers after watching movies ..... :D

If continue video would not change.

Something truly in case if marvel is not the case in the in case no case hero video.

Wasn&#39;t captain marvel a man

Love the reaction on Level 3 Nick on why the cat is a high threat lol.

She proteccShe attaccShe savesShe shoots....Most importantly she had the straightest face in the whole movie, even her friend in the movie showed more facial expressions even though she had less screen time. I have never seen an actor in my whole life who had such expressionless face.

Anna Boden and Brie Larson&#39;s complaint about this movie. Females were under represented in this movie. There was lack of a strong female lead. Men holding whimen back as usual. So sad. When is marvel going to release a superhero movie with a female lead? (As per agenda)

Ironman was godly this one is the opposite. Complete pile of trash, took me three attempts to watch, I fell asleep from boredom.

I love the kitty!

Wow they really did spolied the whole movie

this whole thing was so ironic

Marvel is the worst character in the entire series

2 WORDS. MUST WATCH.  And this trailer really inspires me. Yesterday  I fell and bruised my self badly. But then seeing this makes me wanna get back up. THANK YOU CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!

Somehow I thought captain marvel was a man :/

This is such boring movie.  Pretty stupid. I tried watching it twice a the theater and I fell asleep

Plot twist the cat takes out nick’s eye

I’m sorry but captain marvel is not earth’s mightiest hero,Stan lee is

Can you  upload the full movie of captain marvel

Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman? Which is better? 

I Love the. Avengers the graphics are awesome &amp; so much action. ️

Just imagine getting your eye scratched out is the lamest way possible
