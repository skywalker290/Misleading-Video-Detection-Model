wow brazil sucks dont they live and breathe soccer? what a useless country

in 2022 Switzerland does not tie with Brazil like 2018, we will win. We play better football today and we beat teams that are 3x stronger than Brazil, like France and Spain. See you later Brazil 😗🇨🇭3-2🇧🇷

Switzerland beats VARSIL, so that Uruguay is the big South American surprise
where is the legend Neymar?? lol

Hello

Brazil vs suiiiiiiii
Me!

Coutinho once again in the World Cup

Me here

Argentina beats Switzerland, Netherlands and Belgium in 2014 and Brazil beats Croatia 3-1. In 2014 Netherlands beat Brazil, while both Argentina and Brazil lose to Germany. 2018, Switzerlands draws vs Brazil, and Belgium beats Brazil, while Croatia beats Argentina 3-0.

the score in 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar ---Brazil 3, Switzerland 1 :)

Anyone back here after seeing they&#39;ll meet in the upcoming tournament

Nice match.

Brazil will go for revenge against the Swiss in Qatar. In Russia 2018, the Europeans surprised Canarinha at the beginning of her adventure in Euro-Asian lands. LET&#39;S GO BRAZIL 💛💚💙

I believe that Brazil is a great team and can beat anyone

To this day I still don't like that Swiss corner move, the guy pushed it, and it was clear, and even though we could see the move, they didn't do anything about it.
Here we go again! 🇧🇷 vs 🇨🇭
Again play they for 2022 world cup

they meet again in 2022 wc

Who's here? To remind the opponent that Brazil will catch again

Big nations struggling Little teams winning

Congratulations to Switzerland 🇨🇭

Brazil participating in every cup sounds amazing but then when you think about it there is almost no competition in South America so...

both of them &quot;won&quot;

The majority of that squad is no longer here. Cuotinho. Paulinho. William. Thiago. Maercelo
Pele would have beaten them 5-2 🥶😎

Brazil Brazil Brazil Brazil Brazil...................
I'm for Brazil
This commentator is fantastic. He needs a place in Champions League

Brazil tend to have a sleepy defense from time to time. The way they gave up an easy goal against Switzerland in this game from a corner kick and the same sleeping defense against Germany in their home soil 4 years ago in 2014 World Cup

With this &quot;invention&quot; of VAR, now only these Europeans who will win world cups, anyone doubt?😏
<a href="">0:27</a> great goal from our remarkable little Philipe Coutinho😏👏👏👏👏👏😊

lol typical  coutinho goal

Brazil deserved to win the game because they played better now the left side was horrible with Marcelo it looked like an avenue, every time Switzerland launched a counterattack Marcelo wasn't on defense SLC it made me angry hahaha
For a talented team like Brazil, they really struggled to score in the world cup

I cry for brazil

really nice for Switzerland
It was sad that Brazil drew with Switzerland in their debut
LOVE COUNTRY SWITZERLAND!💖💜💛💗💝💟💚👍 .

Sommer reminded me of Ochoa

Neymar wishes he could’ve scored a goal like that

Back when coutinho was a good player

Up Brazil
Brazil is really poor at defending corners.

Jajajaja

Brazil had everything to win this cup, but they popped up
Coutinho better than neymar

Courtois save coutinho shot. He is better than neymar

I saw all the goals in this FIFA world cup

Brazil is very weak
This is a goal called Coutinho.

Brazil tied with Switzerland 1 to 1? I thought it would be a 4 to 1 in favor of Brazil, but I do not know why Brazil could not, apparently Yann Sommer showed off to the Brazilians

Brazil was good enough but not lucky enough to win his Worldcup trophy number 6 but I think nobody will pass Brazil in Qatar because by than the young Super talents will be ready to play ,of course Neymar has to be there,unfurtunatley Marcelo will be retired. Couthino and Gabriel Jesus will have another chance to perform better....Neymar has to stop rolling....lol....

So seed
2teams are sparkleling !

People let Brazil stay, give them a chance, please, poor Neymar, he was left helpless, please wait for them to see
WHERE IS THE PENALTY THAT GABRIEL JESUS ​​SUFFERED??? BRAZIL WAS ROBBED TODAY WITH A PINT OF LUCK
AND BRAZIL BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE
Brazil should be careful, against Belgium, Russia wants to remove it. A kind of gas that reduces the alertness of the players has been released in the dormitory of the Brazilian players, especially the defensive players.

This damn bastard judge AT LEAST BRAZIL REACHED THE QUARTER FINALS AND SWITZERLAND WAS ELIMINATED TO SWEDEN, and on top of that on Swiss TV when the game ended they showed a drawing of Tom and Jerry with what part of Tom he represented Switzerland and that big dog there that represented Brazil, then the tone that represented Switzerland was hitting the big dog that represented Brazil, and now I'm like:👋👋🇨🇭 bye bye Switzerland

To the person reading this, you are who God says you are. You are made in the image of God, The Creator of  heaven and earth. Because of His love for you and I, He sent His only Son Jesus Christ to die for you so that you can have everlasting life and not go to hell. Jesus Christ is the only Messiah, the King of kings, the Beginning and the End. Jesus Christ is the Savior of the whole world. Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, invite Him into your heart/life today. Wherever you are, He can hear you for He is everywhere. Remember Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to God. Jesus loves you sooooo much so that He gave His life for you. You are valuable...You are loved.

Fan of brazil

I am a single mother living in Korea.The baby&#39;s father has a lot to say, but it looks like the conversation will be long.Don&#39;tIt&#39;s more important to eat.have been giving birth to one&#39;s baby for three months nowI asked the center for support before giving birth, but when I heard that if I gave birth to a baby, it would be supported by goods, and I received the baby&#39;s clothes and support.I received it in May and received it in June, and now due to a lack of budget, my baby&#39;s medical expenses and supplies expenses have been cut off.I&#39;ve been holding out for 200,000 won in child support, and I applied for a diaper voucher, but in Japan, there&#39;s an outrageous shortage of paper diapers and a baby who don&#39;t seem to know how much they use.Having given birth and not being able to work due to bad luck, I paid back my debts, and as a result, my current passbook was held in arrears, but it seems that my allowance was also confiscated.I talk a lot about this and that.I inoculated my child a few days ago, but I couldn&#39;t get the rotavirus.The cost is said to be 100,000 won and 130,000 won.Once mixed;So I&#39;m waiting for the child support to come out.I think I&#39;ll do it for you.It&#39;s really disastrous. It&#39;s just as bad as buying it right after you&#39;re born.Aren&#39;t you a mother who wants to make the seats so empty that she really loves you so much that she won&#39;t feel empty?I didn&#39;t take care of my baby, and it still hurts.I tried to eat one meal a day, and now I have any kind of food.I can&#39;t eat it because it smells fishy.The mothers send me their goods, too, with the words written in earnest at the cafe, but there are only two people who will really send me the goods when you ask them for their addresses. Maybe it&#39;s because of my back tooth father... it hurts a little, but for the one who sends it, it&#39;s really a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bitch.I&#39;m trying to make it look like Bennett&#39;s chogori, which was worn by a baby.I will only return the interest and love the baby has received.Oh, the story went aside.Even though they will receive a guarantee loan from a resident center, they will be seized of their property.Even if it&#39;s going to be miraculous, I will pay for the deposit of 5 pros.Where can I get home appliances for the cost of moving?I asked him what he would do if he didn&#39;t have 100,000 won in money.The phone was delayed and canceled until the bottom.Seizure of uncollectible property, as usual.Come and see me at my house. It&#39;s only after my death that this war will end, if I get the death insurance.It&#39;s because you can repay the debt.I&#39;m happy to see a smiling baby looking only at his mother&#39;s pocket these days.When the baby goes to bed, it&#39;s really hard to hit the wall.If you search for a support site, you will find that it is a place to help African babies.Or, how will the sponsors go about getting support from you because they didn&#39;t have a menu to look for backers?I don&#39;t have any applications.Don&#39;t you get a month&#39;s support? If you know how to do it, why not?Please let me know the details.There is no place to go into the baby center, and although I have a panic disorder and have to eat medicine now, the hospitals that I was attending were also unable to carry my baby through and the psychiatry was expensive, so I couldn&#39;t.There is nothing to accept.I don&#39;t think about adoption.I don&#39;t know if I think I&#39;m a baby and I&#39;m going to be adopted.If it wasn&#39;t for him, even a man who doesn&#39;t have any regrets about the world would think his eyes would be closed, and it&#39;s more important than my life.&quot;It&#39;s my desire, my baby is investigating me already, and the very thought of it makes me cry with horror.If you know anything, please reply.Please tell me how to apply for support.I&#39;m not living there. It&#39;s a tough time in a world where I have to use it, but breathing alone is a costly thing to do, so I would like to ask for help here with the feeling of grabbing straw: 571902-04-105603 (National Bank)

The powerful one (GERMANY SENT HIM HOME NO LESS THAN KOREA) played the game well for the Koreans and the current world champion with BRAZIL 2014 couldn't believe the coach didn't even think in his dreams that he was going to go home so early By history the panjers have always become finalists, and I liked the Koreans' attitude of approaching the game with an equal attack so that they play well and continue supporting us (URUGUAY, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, ARGENTINA)
Let&#39;s see Brazil to win

Couti's great goals are incredible... and every game he repeats them
He played poorly but passed. It is getting better
So i never really understood, what happens if theres a tie?

great goal from Brazilamazing goal from switherland

Now Brazil must destroy Mexico.

I would not have said it.

Little transparency here, when will the National Football Team let us go crazy?

Switzerland always escape from VAR

Love bra,il

Awesome !

Sorry.. out of topics..kindly watch a vd about the divine dreams of muhammad qasim..related about endtimes events such as WW3.. dajjal.. gog&amp;magog..tq

go take it in the ass BR won't even accept impacting krai!!
Come on neymar  more game ⚽ and less tears👶👶👶😭.    💪💪💪💪
Switzerland, somewhat, somehow, has draw 2 times with Brazil (1950! And now). However, Brazil is the great favourite to win WC. But will not be easy, all teams will play ultra-defensive and with fouls, and if is possible, will try to injury or provocate Neymar. With Costa Rica, Brazil also suffer, but finally won.

Ljk
And that chicken that Neymar has in his head: v
Cristiano you have the talent I pass my salan you too strong in my opinion

This year Brazil is shit

Why are switzerland players doing so many foul to NEYMAR?? ARE they JEALOUS of him OR what??????/

Brazil is Losing its Previous Fame and Game Action! Where Are You Neymar?

To prove how controversial FIFA is, today in the England x Panama game, two penalties EQUAL to the one from G. Jesus were scored in the game. This game destabilized Brazil in the cup.
England will win ...

This video is in the voice of the respectable Mr. Mireles, head of the self-defense forces, who has been detained and threatened on countless occasions at the hands of the Mexican army for the sole fact of fighting for the people of Mexico. Let's remove the blindfold our eyes, let's wake up to reality 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽...
I love C R 7

Neymar was on The Octagon in UFC not  stadium

It easy to play agains Switzerland when they dont push oyu and they you get a yellow card like in Switzerland-Serbia think about it FIFA its not ok did you even look at that match did you se when two player of Switzeland holded one of Serbians and then the Serbian goted a yellow card beacuse Switzerland payed the judge!!!!

Magnificent goals from both countries!! Congratulations, Brazil and Switzerland!!! 😄👏👏👏

I like how they comfort each other at the end. These pure hearts.

Shame on you switzerland

Trending bai
switzerland is a cheater team.

nice goal.

What a crappy ref. Brazil was clearly robberd and VAR was not used. Guess if it was 2x0, Swiss should have been lost...  just inacceptable that a multi billionaire sport like this can accept mistakes that change the result of a World Cup match...

There&#39;s a lot to like about this sport, however, one thing that keeps killing it&#39;s credibility is all the fake falling, acting performances after getting slightly touched, it&#39;s so lame. This sport could be even better if men played like men.

Brazil champion, no one can take the 2018 World Cup away from the green and yellow greetings from the Dominican Republic!!
This was the most stolen game of all
Neymar with that haircut looks like a crazy prostitute.
And the Swiss goal was stolen because striker ZUBER pushed defender MIRANDA during a corner kick and the fucking referee let the goal count for VTNC!!
Brazil best in the world, Everyone Knows... Three-time champion..
Come on, turn off Simerah...wait for it again
the narrator said &quot;this is what the world wants to see&quot; When Coutinho scored the goal... little did he know that this 7 to 1 generation only wins the Olympics and no hexa
Brazil will win the cup and that is part of the FIFA contract.
The refeere is blind or just mentally ill?

Brazil has stolen

Great goal of cum👍😉⚽
VAI BRAIL

Viva Brazil...
Wait so people from certain teams for example like Neymar he’s in Paris saint german he has to go back to Brazil?

Good match maked of Switzerland!
