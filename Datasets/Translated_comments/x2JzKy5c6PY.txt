Number 1.. who?

<b>11.10.2023</b>

Hey you forgot Joe Alaskey who is actor and a stand up comedian and a broadcaster and also an impressionist and voice some looney tunes charaters

It&#39;s actually 1994, Not 1993

I cant believe Dale Earnhardt wasn&#39;t on this list

HONORABLE MENTIONS?  YOU IMBECILES.

If you love Steve Irwin then I love you

R.I.P Steve Irwin you will be missed

I still remember when Owen died.  I was a big fan of his and enjoyed his talent.  I didn&#39;t know about his passing until the next day when my mom told me that a wrestler had died.

:(

You forgot Branden Lee he was shot while filling The Crow  <a href="">12:00</a>

Lies

When I heard Steve Irwin died, I was shocked. I liked him when he was The Crocodile Hunter, and he really was a great dad to Robert and Bindi.

His bones weren&#39;t strong enough at 73 or he could have done it what was he thinking

People learned from Steve Irwin never go near stingrays

L

It was pretty obvious to those who deal with wild animals, that Steve Irwin was going to bite it.

Add.  1 John Ritter. He died during a scene on 10 Rules....Co-stars Katry Segal and Kaley Cuoco recalled that day. 2 Sib Hashanah of rock band Boston. He had a heart attack in concert.3 Bruce Lee. He finished filming Enter the Dragon . But, he was still in the middle of filming the movie  Game of Death. RIP to all.

RIP Steve Irwin,he will be missed,a great man that has changed the world.

Eddy from WWE.

Thanks for adding Tiny Tim as an honourable mention. 

Should this really be a top 10?

i cant imagine how those people felt after finding out that the heart attack was not part of the act

I remember Owen Hart or the blue blazer

You forgot dale Earnhardt and Jean baptiste Lully

All of this was so tragic. my respects go out to all of these talented people . ️️️️️️️️️️️
Jackie Wilson suffered a heart attack that sent him into a coma which he never woke up from

I&#39;m quite surprised Dawn Brancheau wasn&#39;t on this list.

Where are the shots?...

April 1984 I was at work 70 miles out of London. Getting ready to take my overnight shift. Then... I saw Tommy Cooper drop dead. Live. On TV. Told my dad. He said &quot;Tommy died with his boots on.&quot;

R.I.P. to all people that have died. all of the people that even seen any of these peope must have been purely devistated. all of these people should not of died

Miracle PrayerLord Jesus, I come before you, just as I am, I am sorry for my sins, I repent of my sins, please forgive me. In your Name, I forgive all others for what they have done against me. I renounce Satan, the evil spirits and all their works. I give you my entire self, Lord Jesus, now and forever. I invite you into my life, Jesus. I accept you as my Lord, God and Savior. Heal me, change me, strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit.Come Lord Jesus, cover me with your Precious Blood, and fill me with your Holy Spirit. I love you Lord Jesus. I praise you Jesus. I thank you Jesus. I shall follow you every day of my life. Amen.

A thing you didn&#39;t mention about Owen Hart’s death is that his wife was worried about the stunt of him being lowered into the ring, but the WWE told her they were getting the best rigging crew for the stunt. Later, it was revealed that the faulty hook used meant they lied to his wife when they said they had the best people for the stunt. She sued and while now she doesn&#39;t hold a grudge against anyone involved, to this day she refuses to let him be inducted into the WWE hall of fame.

Is it just me that doesn’t know these people except Bruce lee but it’s still sad 

R.I.P. Nick menza. He died when playing drums.

Its sad for people to die were gonna excited at 800 m years

Waaaaaaa

Rest in peace to all the fallen greats,this world never deserved you guys or your many talents to begin with. The world will never be the same without them. I can imagine seeing him beyond the pearly gates alongside the likes of Bob Marley,David Bowie,Michael Jackson,Big Pun,Eazy E,James Brown,Jimi Hendrix,Rick James,Tina Marie,Chris Farley,Left Eye,Aaliyah,Charlie Murphy,Richard Pryor,Redd Foxx,Bernie Mac,Robin Williams,Big L,Eartha Kitt,Stan Lee,Jack Kirby,Ike &amp; Tina Turner,Whitney Houston,Mac Miller,Amy Winehouse,Maya Angelou,Nate Dogg,Tupac,Prince,Biggie Smalls,Heath Ledger,Paul Walker,Juice WRLD,Bob Ross,Dusty Rhodes,&amp; Cameron Boyce among various others who were screwed inside and outside of the industry,just chillin while laughing and partying up in heaven alongside Jehovah,Jesus Christ,and all the angels just awaiting our arrival

Steve irwin 1962-2006

<a href="">9:51</a>

Irwin was a god amongst men. He was a legend and will always be a legend. He is missed.

Irwin always fucking about with dangerous wild animals and his kids are now doing the same. Family of fucktards.

if we want to consider sports as performing, then Dale Earnhardt is Number 1 for me

Ayrton Senna should be here

I think you missed Christina Grimmie and John F Kennedy.

I&#39;m waiting to see if Brandon Lee is on this video.

If Brandon Lee was still alive,he would’ve played a great Joker(I still like Heath Ledger’s joker).

May all their souls rest in peace

R.I.P, Brandon Lee.
If I died what I love doing, then I would be dead with some killed people

The Tommy Cooper one was very strange to see as it was watched by millions of people live on TV , although as one of Britain&#39;s top comedians it&#39;s ironic he should go so suddenly with the sound of the audience roaring with laughter, not knowing what had really happened. 8 years earlier the iconic British actor Sid James passed away in very similar circumstances, live on stage in a theatre whilst halfway through a play. Again, the audience thought it was part of the script as well.I&#39;m not 100% sure but didn&#39;t John Candy die whilst the cameras were rolling, during the filming of a comedy western movie?

Tommy Cooper died 70 miles from me, even as I was watching on the television in a room with 25 other US cops before we went to work... I told my dad by letter. He sent a letter back, saying &quot;Talk about a soldier dying with their boots on...&quot; 

<a href="">9:17</a> That&#39;s not a stingray!

this won’t be too well known in america but i live in australia and back in 2014 the was a cricket game new south wales v south australia when sean abbott a young bowler for new south wales bowled a short ball to phil hughes one of the greatest batters at the time which struck him on the neck causing a burst artery.

Steve 
You missed John Ritter while on set for &quot;8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter&quot;.

Steve Erwin is alive.

Tommy cooper is welsh not brittish.

And now the Brandon Lee death happened again with a cinematographer and Alec Baldwin

When I saw the Karl Wellanda fallI thought in my mind<b>&quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot;</b>

(OO)= judgment that is not physically.  mentally.  naturally financially and  spiritually beneficial is useless therefore has no true value.  Without judgment progress cannot be made.  For no one can express or receive love or any other desired emotion in its entirety if the don&#39;t know themselves.  We are all not created equal however one of the common denominators between us all is we all have a equal obligation in living up to the pleasure.  potential.  and responsibility of femininity and masculinity.  So don&#39;t miss the deadline on doing your best to become physically fit.  mentally sound.  and spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom.  Which can be mostly accomplished with clean air.  water.  fitness routine that specializes in overall functionality combined with  high sources of nutrition organic.   non-genetically.  and modified supplements would be best because they are cost efficient easy to consume loaded with all the vitamins.  minerals.  and protein your body needs to function at its best also available on the go and you don&#39;t need electricity or refrigeration to maintain them being edible.    Plus formal education and real hands-on experience.      When one learns ther own body&#39;s capabilities and limitations by fully engaging with all their bodies senses to their extreme limits in the most efficient way that is humanly possible.  The subconscious then begins to gradually.  constantly.  consistently.  naturally.  consciously.  and systematically coincide with the mind.  body.  souls  spirit.  mother Earth.  nature.  and all the various different forms of life that live within this world in the most efficient way that is humanly possible.   Thus yieldingthe best spiritual kickback for one&#39;s efforts accomplishments experiences.     You might want to take these points to heart  Considering the simple logic basic concept that if life is not free.  why the hell would death be any cheaper? It&#39;s not the question the common.  basic.  average.  normal man or woman may be able to wonder is what is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit for freely living dying off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they are first born with.    Not to add insult to injury for the last hundred and 50 years or so the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally more so here in America.        has been living and dying yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  And that has nothing to do with everybodys so-called charming personality and everything to do with the standards of quality pertaining to our air.  water.  foods.  landscapes.  working/living environment.  every day home products.  habitats.  and ecosystems.  This lack of comprehension conscious physical participation in solutions is ignorant beyond retarded (no offense to any disabled people was intended. ) When you consider for the last 490 years Give or take we have had the manpower woman influence or vice versa   to have created clean high paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally that would  be making progress 24 seven be improving upon and maintaining the quality of our life in such a manner.    	  That the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally  would constantly consistently naturally.  gradually.  and systematically almost effortlessly start becoming stronger.  smarter.  healthier.  happier.  better off physically.  mentally.  and financially possibly spiritually then the previous generation.    Now I would like to resurrect the wish and prayer I made prior to my 8th birthday which was to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim to the way I&#39;m living personally and professionally.  I guarantee you never see or hear another body.  man or woman in power.  persons of legal.  religious authority.  or leaders ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty one reason they don&#39;t have the best interest of the majority of the population&#39;s needs at heart a another reason could be they cum   from a bloodline of cowards or simply have a lifestyle that suggests.  confirms.  and validates them as being feebleminded physically inadequate submissive subservient which it doesn&#39;t get any worse than that.  One is genetically inherited and the other is a simple generic learned behavior.  Quite possible to be a combination of these worst-case scenarios combined is one to say the least.  Nonetheless either way it is physically.  mentally.  financially and spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low quality manner. 		 Especially if that ignorant stupidity.  weak.  lonely desperation  stems from being soft.  lazy.  out of shape.  over fed.  undernourished.  overworked.  and underpaid with a dirty low-paying job that comes from outdated power sources.  inferior materials.  poisonous.  toxic substances.  pesticides.  and chemicals that never change their killing composition.  Which means simpletons whether it is a solid.  liquid.  or burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor it is always going to be poisonous.  debilitating.  and deadly to the body at the same time polluting.  corrupting.  and devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world.  There is no cash profit to be made in the destruction of the planet.  Thanks to those dirty low-paying jobs we are in the mist of environmental financial global collapse.   The good news souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on the end results of those dirty low-paying jobs And so much more.    The even better news that the common.  basic.  average.  normal man woman may be able to comprehend is souls and spirits have been are being managed.  directed.  maintained.  and implemented with all the disease.  sickness.  illness.  pain.  suffering.  injury.  abuse.  neglect.  hunger.  addiction.  sadness.  anger.  and hyper- aggressive violent criminal conduct.  That has been allowed to occur manifesting throughout the history of mankind into what it is today thanks to Donald Trump and like-minded who have the false belief if the mass majority of the population is at their worst they will feel   less afraid scared inferior to the true potentials of love.  honor.  and the creation of life.    In the way of being a mother.  father.  parent.  guardian.  or caretaker this greatest most pleasurable of all responsibilities should instinctively include a method of parenting that will practically guarantee that infant.  baby.  newborn.  toddler.  young child.  teenager will grow.  develop maturing into a strong.  confident.  healthy.  successful.  independent.  fun-loving adult that can joyfully make their way through life as a single.  married.  leading or simply just being a healthy.  happy.  productive part of a massive group which is society option 2 not quite as exciting spiritually rewarding nonetheless a quantum leap in progress.  Would be for those to have the physical.  mental capabilities of being able to slip and grip ground and pound into paradise so intensely intimately that it gets the soul and spirit off with no negative strings attached maybe even in the free and clear.  Here&#39;s the deal you&#39;re either part of the world solutions or exacerbating the planets problems there is no safe in between.  Either way no matter how you look at it each and every moment of every life has been spiritually accounted for.  S. R. F.  bello

8  it&#39;s a simple concept basic logic if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper it&#39;s not. So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit for having lived and died to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today&#39;s people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today&#39;s people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial. S.R.F.

Mandela effect. I thought Brandon Lee died during the table n everyone shot at him

RIP Steve Irwin. He was a legend. May he live on in our hearts forever.  respect

My son was so sad when Steve Irwin died, it was quite a shock. It&#39;s terrible explaining to a little kid that the doctors can&#39;t fix everyone.

Owen Hart&#39;s death traumatized me.

Harry Houdini actually died of appendicitis

I’m sure Steve Irwin is smiling down on his family. He was amazing!

I still get all choked up about Steve Irwin. Probably the only celebrity who has died that had any actual emotional effect on me. I remember like it was yesterday.

Interesting fact: Vic Morrow is actress  Jennifer Jason Lee&#39;s father..

Respect for Owen Hart and Steve Irwin

<a href="">5:22</a> Another thing about the Twilight Zone deaths is that the child actors were hired for the movie under the table, violating a number of child labour laws (specially regarding their safety)... It&#39;s appalling that John Landis was never jailed for this, and even managed to build a successful career afterwards.

Little clarification. The stingray that killed Steve Irwin didn&#39;t actually turn on him and attack him. It was all just an unfortunate accident. According to eye witnesses, they were in the middle of recording a scene that had Steve slowly swimming along over the ray. One of the camera crew recording had unfortunately gotten a little too close with the camera and spooked the stingray.  This caused it to quickly turn away from the camera in front of it, which also caused the barb along its tail to pierce Steve&#39;s chest as he swam along with it.

“but just like that he was gone” I KINDA GIGGLED

I remember when Steve Irwin died I was really little and I remember always watching the crocodile hunter and wanting so badly to do that I remember when it happened just feeling so bad about it not even really completely understanding what death really was I remember my dad and mom were very shocked about it and at the time I thought it just meant that he pad disappeared that it was so sad that his children grow up without their father my parents passed away but I was a senior in high school when it happened it was still hard but I can&#39;t imagine growing up without one or both parents

kinda random, but my uncle was on tour with his band when he died.

I think you missed Dale Earnhardt. He died while racing the final lap of the Daytona 500.

Bruh when I watched number 9 fall he disappeared when he touched the ground where he go?

I&#39;m at the <a href="">10:16</a> mark and if I had to pick a famous person to die doing what they loved. JFK would be my number one.

All of these deaths shocked me but the one that shocked me the most was Karl Wallenda’s death 

Dale Earnhardt
What about Elvis Presely

Poor Owen hart! But why He got that job?

R.I.P. Dime and Steve, I loved Both \m/ \m/

The guy who killed dime bag Darrell effectively got his head blown off with a shotgun

Imagine if everyone had a smartphone during Owen Hart&#39;s fall would be everywhere

They forgot Dale Earnhardt Sr. He died while helping his son and friend get a 1-2 finish in the 2001 Daytona 500. To this day he is the last death in Nascar. His friend , Michael Waltrip, won his first race in the biggest race of the season. What would have been the happiest day of his life ended up being the worst.

I know then medic show up and peapl

John Ritter died while filming 8 Simple Rules

John Ritter
I only heard on XCannys Video of 10 Songs that sounds Familiar: DOOM (Consisted of I AND 2) and He mentioned at the end of the video (and the updated/redone version he mentioned someone else from the band) That Dimebag Darrell was gone and it (the original was dedicated to him and the second/redone version was in memory of Him and another band members of Pantera that I don&#39;t recall his name in their honor, I had assumed Dimebag had a Heart attack in the 99&#39;s or early 2000s, this was a shock to find out his actual Cause of deathAnd I didn&#39;t even know Pantera broke up, I thought they were still aroundBTW, because of the Familiar videos,  I was introduced to many bands(Pretty much all 6? He mentioned, Cuase 4 of Pantera&#39;s songs from the same album were Inspired use for the games soundtrack) and a new Song by AC/DCBut it&#39;s a shame to Dimebag Darrells Deaths  May he Rest in Peace

There was an actor/comedian names Sid James who was performing onstage who died.

Poor steve irwin he was Best human i ever now

I remember being downstairs listening to the radio as a kid when I heard Steve Irwin died.  I ran upstairs and woke up my parents.

Steve died in 2006 not 2007

Leave it to Muslims to be offended

nice

Paul Walker have not been mentioned

<a href="">1:07</a> US

I believe they sacrifice Lee

Alias Smith and Jones Pete Duel

Owen Hart and Steve Irwin  both are miss

The way everything is so nonchalantly said almost makes it not feel real. The reality is tragic

Selena Quintanilla is not in the list

Eddie Guerrero 
Rip steve Irwin i love his show he is best

<a href="">9:00</a> my friends .loved this show, for always I knew he died from a sting-ray

What happened to Owen Hart, just shocking, I was so  sad for his family,  wonderful performer who died so tragic, 

John Ritter when he died during “8 Simple Rules”

The #1 was pretty metal rip

In Brazil there was a singer named Mc Daleste who died while singing on stage. shot him

RIP Owen Hart

What about elvis

I still remember when Wallenda died, though I was only 11.

Steve Irwin was a bogan fckwit. Can we stop talking about him?

where is joker ???

The rigging for wallenda was fine the problem was he wanted to be a daredevil n not wear a safety harness, while acts like these n similar ones are done without safety equipment all the time when it fails it’s almost always on human error of the performers n while it’s also sad it’s still the performers fault, ppl that blame it on something other than that when it’s not are the problem bc they enable ppl to stupidly dangerous acts with 0 regard for safety, but that’s why circus and carnival performers have such a bad reputation bc all they care about is being cheap, making money, and themselves

RIP
Dude Steve Irwin should have been number one

Me:Can I get some likesAlso me: LEGEND NEVER DIE

Weird how this was recommended after the Astrofest 2021 events...

Rip

Eddie Guerrero
Jehovah God promises that those who have died will live again in Isaiah 26:19:&quot;Your dead will live. My corpses will rise. Wake up and shout for joy, residents of the dust! For your dew is like the morning dew, and the earth will let those who are powerless in death live again.&quot;He will bring them back to life; that is the hope of the resurrection.

I&#39;m from Calgary. This whole city went into mourning for Owen. I&#39;ve never been hard-core into wrestling. But the Hart family is huge in that world and my city was a huge start of what is now WWE. Every damn one of them from back in the day trained here

You should have included Dale Earnhardt, NASCAR racer who died on the track.

RIP DIMEBAG!! 
Rip to the actors and lee know him and Bruce are in heaven smiling down on there love ones until they meet again all of them with there loved ones ️️️️️

Wait a minute so ther’s another Brandon lee.

“My job, my mission, the reason I’ve been put onto this planet, is to save wildlife.”-Steve IrwinWhat a legendary hero he was

My heart dropped I just thought it was it an extra scene put in as a blooper  so I wouldn&#39;t believe what I saw

I remeber the twight zone movie it came out a year before i was born but i did not see it until years later

Steve Irwin didn’t deserve to die

GREAT DEATHS, much nore better then dine inside your bed uyseless moveless piece of boring shit

Whats decapitated means?

I guess  no one has any respect  for any racedrivers do they?.Nascar  has NEVER been the same since Dale Earnhardt  sr died!.Also Aryton  Sienna and Dan Weldon as well!!!!.

Steve Irwin was a huge loss on my childhood.

I honestly was hoping Dimebag would be on this list, but since most people don’t like heavy metal I didn’t think he would be included. But putting him at #1 gives me reassurance that people actually DO pay attention to what needs to be recognized and acknowledged.

Based on your videos I wasn&#39;t expecting you to put dimebag darell at nb 1, R.i.p legend dimebag darell
Where was Paul Walker?? he died while filming fast 7 .

Don&#39;t forget Paul walker

Jesus christ.. I didnt think that they&#39;d show him falling..!! it lowkey scared me.. eheh..

Is there some more of these deaths I love to learn about these things

Dale Earnhardt should have been #1 on the list.

Click baite 
How&#39;s the grizzly man not on here? Was it just because of his pure foolishness 

I refuse to belive that Brandon Lee&#39;s death was an accident, i get they had a lot of guns and bullets but still, seems too coincidental that he was actually shot during the last scene he made

So john died because he was being a idiot.

Owen heart ( wwe wrestler )

That twilght zone accident Vic Morrow getting his head chopped off by a helicopter is pretty freaking crazy really...

Man how have i never seen that Wallenda footage of him falling in my 30 years of existence...wow

R.I.P Owen. You where great.

Oh man the first one is tragic man… I mean seriously it’s embarrassing but it’s an honest mistake! 

You forgot tim maia
Kevin Todd Smith who played Aries from Xena Warrior Princess and Hercules the legendary journeys he had a falling accident

My favorite is Chris Farley, Kurt Cobain and Michael Jackson. All to young. Dont do drugs

I hoped to Ayrton Senna

R.I.P. Steve Irwin

NOOO NOT MY BOI STEVE IT STILL HURTS TO THIS DAY

And no Eric Morecambe what a disgrace this channel is he should have been your number 1

MUST YOU TALK? AAAAAAAHHHHHH!

Tiny Tim gives me nightmares

Did u know that when Owen heart died the heart family sued WWE

You forgot bruce lee
That&#39;s so sad.

Christina Grimmie, Paul Walker...
Ngl Karl wallend deservs this why is a 73 year old dude dringend this

I feel bad for the people in the video, especially Steve Irwin, I don&#39;t know much about him but being put to death By a stingray, that&#39;s so scary and Horrorfying !!!!

You missed Eddie Guerrero, yeah I know eddie passed away on a hotel in November 13 2005 from Heart failure . But a week earlier he was fighting in the ring and suddenly was lossing his breath and suffered a heart attack but survived.

As I Metalhead I approve of #1, RIP Dimebag, your music still lives on

Why didn&#39;t you guys even mention Shane McConkey? Literally died while doing what he loved too and its on film! Disrespect. One of the biggest and greatest extreme athletes EVER!

I was looking for Brandon Lee and Steve Irwin, but seeing Dimebag as #1, you got it perfectly right

DEATH: No matter who you think you are!

The worst part about Owen Hart did NOT want to do it. He was afraid something like that would happen, and Vince McMahon (the owner of the company) still made him do it

where is bruce lee

Imagine performing a cutting a box, but you actually died when the person cut the box, spilling blood making it dark in the stage

Imagine your death being an “honourable mention”

The crocodile hunter will live in our hearts forever! 

<a href="">9:35</a> And for nearly 6 years I thought he was killed by a crocodile!  Rest in Power Legend.

Twilight zone the movie is probably the saddest the poor man tried protecting the children but failed

Owen hart  it’s a shame

I just found out that Brandon lee was born on the same day I was born

Johnny Ace was murdered he didn&#39;t accidently shoot himself

Professional wrestling may be fake, but Hart’s death was very real. His death was not part of the show

Steve Irvin was an animal manhandler and that sting ray did him good.

I remember watching Tommy Cooper collapsing it was awful 

Which one is Redd fox? @<a href="">10:11</a>. Needs consult google. Or maybe both actors are.

Dimebag was a legend, Rest In Power

this video is 5 years old today :0

Ohh typo perfoming
Tiny Tim already had heart attack two months before that&#39;s sign to stop acting

Where&#39;s tom walker?

Where&#39;s Robin Williams

Steve died 12 days after my birthday, I just turned 18 then,......cried worse than I did my own grandmothers passing 4 years ago, I was ok with her passing, but his,....

Peace be upon you.. O people, I advise you to enter the religion of Islam so that you will be saved from the torment of God.  Read the Qur’an, for it contains deliverance from torment and attainment of Paradise.

People in the 70s-90s sure sucked at announcing someone&#39;s death on tv

Kills with too CHILD actors DECAPATED 

STEVE IRWING WAS A COMPLETY IDIOT WHO TOOK UNNECESSARY RISKS.  I DON&#39;T FEEL ANY PITY FOR MORONS.

Very freaking sad,  but so freaking devastating and very freaking senseless

dale Earnhart
Rip Steve Irwin

Christina Grimy was another one that died in Florida I was there at Kemper Area for Owen Hart he didn’t hit the top rope he hit the turn buckle and post

Dale Earnhardt Sr?
I would have held on to the rope with my life. That was stupid asf

Steve Irwin was an Idiot and I have absolutely NO sympathy for anyone that exploits God&#39;s Creatures just to become rich and famous! I felt bad for the family, but he&#39;d been warned multiple times.

Perro Aguayo Jr ghost: you guys care about Owen Hart except for me people these days always forgetting that I died in wrestling match while preforming

Some people think that the things that Steve Irwin did were foolish and that he deserved his death. Shame on them for thinking and saying that.

The only one I know on this list is Steve Irwin. His shows were on TV when I was a kid. I remember hearing about his death after it happened. He would have been the type of celebrity I would have wanted to meet. Just like him, I love all animals-even dangerous ones just like he did. Too bad he didn&#39;t survive. Had he been hit somewhere else by the stingray barb, he would have had a better chance of surviving. That I&#39;m sure of.

I am 28 and there is only one celebrity who I distinctly remember what I was doing and how I found out the day Steve died, he was a amazing guy full of life. I am so glad Bindi and Robert are continuing his journey of wildlife preservation.

Some of these people i knew im so sad

O.O

I only got to known steve Irwin last month i had no idea he died i havnt known him too well but i feel bad for him he died doing what he lovedRip crocodile hunter

If I were to “die doing what I loved”, I’d likely die suddenly of a heart attack or stroke while playing my Switch or my 3DS/DSi or a game on my iPad, or choke to death eating delicious food.Not that I’m morbid or anything...

Why cant I see my self dying  and who at my funeral  shot

J.I. Rodale jinxed himself
Got the wrong scene for Brandon Lee, the scene is where he comes at them while at the long table.

If I died doing what I love it probably be Choking on popcorn wile watching Godzilla

Shit, watching the guy fall from the high wire 

Dale Earnhardt Sr
I know there was a voice Actor that died while working. I can&#39;t remember his name though but Rob Paulsen was there when it happened.

Terry Kath of the band, Chicago. While known for being a guitarist, he was a gun collector since he was young. One night, after a concert with Chicago, he was cleaning a .38 Revolver. He was tired, the gun had a sensitive trigger, and...POW!

RIP Dime and Christina Grimmie, They both died on stage while performing music :(

As a hardcore wrestling fan, Owen Hart&#39;s death was crushing for the industry.

I just came for Steve ️
Christina Grimmie.. 
M E: Listening To ’ ’ The Hum ’ ’ The Video: Celebrities Dying While Showing-OffMe: Looks At The Video- Hm?- HOLY $H!T -

What about Ayrton Senna ?

Steve Irwin is my hero.🇮🇩
Wow he actually died like that on sage and Steve Erwin man his daughter had a baby

Wooww very sad actually 

RIP Steve Irwin. Funny I thought it&#39;d be a cobra or crocodile since he was always pushing their buttons. Never imagined it&#39;d be a stingray :(. Also the first one they explained in 1000 ways to die that even blanks can be deadly.

Steve Irwin 

I was only 6 when my hero died...My Grandpa&#39;s Dad...he was a great man and lived his life happy everyday...im sure he is with my Grandma very happily in heaven

Heart Attack? If you get the reference, you get a ps5

You missed Bruce Lee

This seen was so sad and hard to watch <a href="">2:39</a>

What about the late great Eddie Guerrero

RIP everyone who died

Eddy Guerrero was  also a wrestler  latino  heat also had a similar  moment  as owen  hart

Rip The Crocodile hunter

Dale Earnhardt Sr should&#39;ve been on here

My great grandfather died doing what he loved he was a Tennessee tobacco farmer for most of his life and was a ww2 seargent in the army and my dad and him were cutting tobacco of summer in 97 and he had a heart attack doing what he loved

So people now rank deaths?

One of the saddest parts of Owen hart’s death is that he hated the company and was in the midst of trying to leave

Thailand&#39;s Mitr Chaibancha should be on this list too.

RIP Owen Hart

U missed selena ...

I’m curious why wasn’t Pete Maravich he got a heart attack during a basketball game

Most shockingly:Jackie Chan isn&#39;t on this list.

Owen hart and Bret hart
Steve Erwin We will never forget you ️

I remember hearing that Steve Irwin was killed by a sting ray and at first I thought it was someone’s idea of a sick joke, I was like “that’s not funny guys” but it wasn’t a joke it was all too real. What I really remember afterwards was that I felt like I’d had the wind knocked out of me. I just sat there in shock trying to come to grips with how it could happen. I must have been like that for a few hours before the tears finally came flooding out. A lot of people at my school wore black as a sign of morning because many of us had grown up watching him. But even though Steve Irwin is sadly gone his legacy is in good hands with his family and his many fans and admirers who still strive to keep his dream alive.

Still not over Steve&#39;s death

Why not brush Lee

There are really people who thinks wrestling is cool?

why do they always get ANNOYING  people to narrate these clips??? for pete sake do one will ya

May the all Rest In Peace.

You missed Elvis Presley
Tiny Tim freaks me out
Greg Page from the Wiggles came close. Thank goodness he survived.

Hi

Man dimebag darrel has a place in my soul
The one that shook me the most was Owen Hart I didn&#39;t watch the Over The Edge pay per view I heard about it on Monday Night Raw . I do however have another one Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna was killed in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix of 1994 .

Anyone here in 2021

Owen hart died in zip line
Finally a WatchMojo video that doesn’t suck

Irwin died doing what he loved: teasing deadly animals to see if they would attack him.

Crice look it’s a tiger

Dumb deaths
We all miss Steve Irwin

<a href="">3:00</a> stupid haha

&quot;Do you agree with our list&quot; yeah i think theyre all dead

You forgot rfk
There were two other deaths that I watched during an iceberg. One: A person who discover and teach the audience behind the screens of the mid/late 1900&#39;s was killed during his shoot on crocodiles. While a a crocodile he was giving facts about the video was still being shot, meaning there were actual footage during his painful death. It still was shooting because at the beginning of his career, he had saide to never stop recording, no matter what happens. Second: a person who was doing the same like the last one I said was giving out facts about a certain animal (i forgot), then, while shooting, he was, like the last one, was attacked and killed by the animal he was giving out facts. the thing is that they only had audio because the cap of the camera was on and the time during his death taken place. Many people, after listening to the pain of him, said to destroy it, but his wife kept it.

U forgot eddie guerrero
SHE PULLE HIS FUCKING LIFE SUPPORT

If I die its gonna be something like falling off a catwalk or drinking acid or something.

Sigh

Aw

Eddie Guerrero should have been number 1 or atleast a honourable mention r.I.p Eddie you will be truly missed 1967-2005

I still miss Steve Irwin! 

Why is Dale Earnhardt not on this list

r.i.p dime
Owen Hart

I used to watch crocodile hunter here in my country ....nam jamaica

Steve Irwin died in 2006 not 2007

I hate saying I&#39;m glad someone&#39;s dead but I&#39;m glad tiny tim is dead. Fuck that guy. His song traumatized me when I watched insidious. Now I can&#39;t even watch the movie without being scared of hearing the song. Then his other song was played on the spongebob pilot episode help wanted. I&#39;m sorry his voice and the music was so creepy and terrifying

Wasn’t there a female singer shot while performing? I can’t think of the name? —very young—just starting out.

All of these people who died they died to young like the first one they died at 26 FUCKING 26 YOU KNOE HOW MANY YEARS THEY HAD OF LIFE LEFT? YEARS AND I MEAN SO MANY YEARS its actually so sad and if you LAUGH at there death YOU YOURSELF CAN DIE

Why wasn&#39;t the trainer who died at seaworld on this list? She died tragically.

Steve Irwin dieing took me a few days as a kid to realise it really happened me n my dad used to watch all his programs a terrible loss

this comment is a tribute to Eddie Guerrero since he wasn&#39;t mentioned, this wrestling Legend suffered a heart attack in the middle of the ring. RIP Eddie Guerrero.

Dimebags death was a huge loss as a metal fan and guitarist he was one of the reasons I decided to play guitar

A very nice tribute!  Thank you!

Rip mate 

Rest in peace owen hart. 21 years and will never be forgotten ️️

John Eric : <b>*dies*</b>His mom : mmm free kidney and other parts to sellAlso: <a href="">1:39</a>

Number 1 Juice Wrld

Broooo! Why&#39;d you guys have to do this? F***..... Steve Irwin . WHYYYYYYYYYYYY???!!!!!!!!!

Ayrton Senna. I cried buckets watching that. And also Dan Wheldon. Watching two of your heroes die live on TV is not good. It still stays with me all these years later.I also though Felix Baumgartner (probably spelt wrong) was dying as he fell spinning for so long

what about Peter Brock

Why does Brandon lee look like wwe superstar sting

Owen Hart better be here

Holy crap I was born in 2007 and that&#39;s when steve irwin got stabbed by a sting Ray

All I can say &quot;expect the unexpected &quot;.

Am I the only one in to watch it in 2021?

Tommy Cooper&#39;s was pure horrifying.

Dale Earnhardt died at Daytona 500 2001 just so you know...

Where&#39;s Dale Earnhardt ?  And also wingsuiters (it&#39;s a sport)  like Dwayne Westen could be an honorable mention ?  I know Dwayne wasn&#39;t all that famous but he was still famous.  At least I think of him as being famous.

Amazing performance but tragic death   .

How is Steve Irwin’s death not number 1?

RIP EVERYBODY WHO DIED OF CORONA !!!

I love you tiny tim
Rip to all.

Tommy Cooper was a great man.

You&#39;ve missed Selena Gomez

You forgot JFK  because someone got his assanaton on film and he was famous

Iwin thought he was the lord of animals world, like Tarzan of the  jungle was the with animal  world.. well, respect the animal world. Like Tarzan.

rip steve an austrialian legand
Owen Hart OMG im crying!
if i died doing somthing i loved it would be like tripping and falling on the sidewalk and smashing my face while eating a hamberger and not paying attention.

Aryton Senna isn’t even an honerable mention???

U missed Bruce lee and John F. Kennedy

why are all these in the 80s?

every deaths are sad 

Dimebag deserved 1. He was the most talented guitarist and a very well respected guitarist in the metal industry. As mentioned, he was murdered on stage, unlike the others on the list. There will never be another.

the rope one when everyone came rushing to help, not being rude but how can they help an old man after falling from that height?

Who else here for Steve Irwin... 

Christina Grimme 
RIP

Howl
Owen
Owen Hart
‏Peace be upon you. Humanity requires advice to all mankind to guide you to the grace of hearts, not of bodies, the grace of the heart (happiness), where do you find it?  God willing.  Where is that?  Read about Islam from its sources, not from its enemies, and man is the enemy of everything he does not know, so if he teaches him, he loves it.

Rip all those people those were there last performances !!

Steve  Irving

Tip toe
Why wasn&#39;t Heath ledger in the list?

HIS MOM TURNED OFF HIS LIFE SUPPORT

You could also add Sib Hashian (Boston) and Nick Menza (Megadeth) to this list. Both were drummers who died on stage while performing

Hey im puerto rican and i never heard of him

İf i died i would probbaly die while singing on the contest from T pose group

Id like two words on my tombstone what if

I️ Steve Irwin it&#39;s sad  that he died

Watch mojo is so messed up anybody else see how they are profiting of people’s tragic death actually everyone who does this kind of stuff also imagine having your death by a honorable mention

<a href="">9:14</a> and he got visit by the wiggles

We need up a date in 2021 because to shone line of covid. I not mean to spread covid. I mean too make us happy again. Hear sad news sometimes make you happy like one person did some thing right. Like cry go to happy.   Or if covid gone by the time if you do this. Them not so important, .  Not hard to live at 100 or past 100 by the way. Well whatever wish you well in covid days.  and should not have wrote the last line or emoji. 

The ones that hit me the most are Owen, Steve and Dime 

Rip Steve Irwin Australian hero
Omg I still can’t believe Steve Erwin is dead

Selena too :/

Why they use real guns while filming?

steve irwin best person ever seen in the wild life

Selina (shot by her no.1 fan/agent)

Imagine spamming this in the comments: What about Kobe Bryant?

I searched up stupid ass people and this popped about 147 times

we will mist them all

That one guy was an idiot

Steve Irwin :: you don&#39;t f*** about with Captain Scarlet~ Stingray - stingray

say dad ah¬
I was looking forward to seeing who Number 1 was. I was so disappointed that Ayrton Senna wasn’t even on the honorable mentions. May 1st 1994. Look into it, see the difference the man made, and how he died. He deserved to at least be on the list but noooooo. I’m sorry, love the videos, but this was a huge disappointment for me.

<a href="">2:42</a> was very hard to watch....

You guys missed the grizzly man

I just realized  how short life is
Vic morrow wasn&#39;t just decapitated, he was torn to shreds by the helicopter blades along with the 2 children that died with him.

<a href="">0:15</a>

This is sad as hell

John Eric Hexum is stupid

People commonly say &quot;he/she died doing what they loved&quot; when they have no idea if that is true or not, some of them died working, when they may have preferred doing almost anything else!  But people say that because it makes THEM feel better, when it may not be true at all!

You missed Dan Wheldon, killed during an IndyCar race at Las Vegas. The field did 10 laps under caution as a Tribute,after he died. If he could come from Last to Win, he would have got 1 million dollars. He gave it his best shot, but I think he got shredded by the catch fence like a cheese grater. Super Sad to watch on live TV. Also Dale Earnhardt SR, died on the last lap of The Daytona 500. Also Adam Petty, &amp; Kenny Irwin died during practices.

 owen rip one of the best wrestlers there has been

0% did yall forget dr.mather Luther king i&#39;m very disapointed AM i the only person

R.I.P.Everyone in this videothey all will be missed

Ayerton Senna?!!! Oh my god.... you can’t say top 10 and not include the best F1 driver in the history who died in an F1 car!

How do you rate this?

DUDE where Is DALE earnheardt

I know its something you do in all of your videos, but I think this one could have done without an &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; category

I agree with dimebag being number one but nick menza should at least be an honerable mention.

Well little Richard passed away in 2020 rip little Richard he was a good singer uh good guy

LEGENDS NEVER DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WHEN THE WORLD IS CALLING YOUUUUUUUUUUUU

<a href="">8:57</a> he wasnt 11?

I am streaming my channel @drillz yt
If I die doing what I love, I&#39;ll die from a vert ramp
So he basically killed himself

The tommy kooper one breaks my heart ;-;

Everyone who said Steve Erwin is wrong it is Steve Irwin

This video is extremely tragic and I don&#39;t want to take anything away from the subject matter HOWEVER that&#39;s a manta ray @<a href="">09:15</a> not a stingray, a harmless species of ray.

why is dale senior  not on this list

Paul. Walker

You forgot Grant ThompsonDeath by paragliding accident

Why not mention Kurt ?  YOU ASKED I&#39;M SAYING

Steve erwins death hit hard for me
Much appreciation for the video  you guys are terrific

Hey guys I&#39;m completely amazed dimebag made number 1 I was blessed to see pantera on their last tour together but I saw damageplan April 15 2004 at a small bar in Jackson Mississippi and he literally put a guitar pick in my hand while he was playing my most valuable possession thanks you guys for giving a music legacy changing musician a spot thank you 🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒

RIP Paul Walker

TOP 10 ANIME DEATHS

Steve Irwin’s death is an example of cruel irony.

Dale Earnhardt?
2007 i was born

Lets be honest we were all waiting for the guy on the thumnail

R.I.P Owen Hart(Blue Blazer) 1966-1999. You are forever missed

I was waiting to see Paul Walker and Selena



“Indeed, God and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, pray upon him.
And they greeted them with complete peace.
“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of <b>Jesus Christ,</b> that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.”

Thank god for islam

What about Paul Walker.

️REST IN PEACE ️
If id die doing what I loved ill die playing my guitar for my grandpa️
What about Paul Walker

Steve Irwin was cruel.

I don&#39;t even know whether to like or unlike

Eddie Guerrero wasn&#39;t on this list and he should have been at least an honourable mention. Just a heads up guys at watch mojo

-_-

Imagine the last thing you hear being people laughing at your death

This is so disrespectful she sounds happy

Man everyone having a heart attack

This is like the only channel where memes are non-existant

Can we just use plastic guns for movies?

Rip Steve Irwin🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Eddie Guerrero??(Might have spelt his last name wrong)

Bruh I thought the guy that fell down at 2.42 just got up and started running

Sid James

So dark. 
Six days of surgery?

marvin gaye
So he killed himself

Lets all remember Steve Irwin, for being so brave and bringing us fun, not thinking about the consequences.

<a href="">4:52</a> wait MICAH? I still need my revenge for you after killing Arthur! You rat

Does jfk count
Owen Hart landed face up not on his chest

Eddie Guerrero. He may not have died in the ring, but he had a heart attack in the ring in a handicap match against the Dudley’s and JBL

You missed dale Earnhardt’s death
Steve
<a href="">0:43</a> harry had met a young fan who’d asked him if he could survive a really bad punch harry said nothing could stop him so the boy punched him really hard. Imagine being killed by a child you thought couldn’t stop you

Vic Marrows death was brutal.

At least they went out doing what they love

Joseph Burrus?)

Watch mojo host: #4 Owen HartMe:*Cries*
What about eddie Guerrero

<a href="">2:42</a>

Only people from the USA there in the video. Only Americans die when performing?

Where is amitabh bacchan...... lol 
Just remember, when any animal dies, they go to Steve Irwin and he takes care of them

Irwin is number 1

Fly who is not able to live by itself, fat, bold, going to consume, shit as it wants having own view on life - WHAT CAN BE MORE FUNNY?!

Why isnt Cameron Boyce on the list?

River Phoenix?

River Phoenix?

How could you leave off Dale Earnhardt???? He died on the last lap of the Daytona 500. His death overshadowed Mike Wallace&#39;s victory..... and he was driving a Dale Earnhardt owned race car

This video doesn&#39;t make a straight sense because I&#39;m very confused if I&#39;m watching their character die or in real life

I was waiting for Owen Hart..

I&#39;m  suprised, No Dale Earnhardt sr!.

Why did redd fox his death made me cry the most i loved the shows he was on

Why show Karl Wallenda falling? That’s a bit disturbing. No hate.

but where is eddie guerrero that was very sad

Poor Owen Hart R.I.P
I respect them



What about left eye from TLC

Rip all of them, may god forgive them for their sins and take them to heaven

The WWF covered it up and his family won around 10,000,000 dollars

Own Hart&#39;s should have been switched with Eddie Guerrero as he was quite famous and you can see his death on tape.

<a href="">2:42</a>Imagine just seeing someone fall to their death, must be terrifying.

Dick Shawn; slapstick comedian; collapsed on stage, audience laughing, and laid there until it was realized it was not part of his act.

rip owen hart best wrester ever
Where’s Eddie Guerrero?
i wonder where steve irwin will be if he didnt of died?

The honourable mentions mostly suffered heart attack. In fact that&#39;s half of this list

Putting names of people in honourable mention is just disrespectful.

You missed Kobe Bryant‘s death

I still can&#39;t hear about Dimebag and Irwin without crying.

I really a fan of Bruce Lee and seeing Brandon Lee died in the half way continue his father legacy truly sad for me :(

Irwin was murdered  by his wife&#39;s boyfreind  idk man just seems odd how she got married to that guy 10 months later  my dad has had 100s of dives with stingrays And that is just not how they work

Steve Irwin was a daredevil.

I&#39;m watching this, but never heard of any of these people. (Watching that man fall made me hold my breath, oml) 

Where&#39;s kobe

Dale Earnhardt could of been on this list

The puns in this video are terrible

This was uploaded a month and a half after former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died onstage. You could&#39;ve mentioned him.

The title is so dark it’s like saying I loved killing little kids

<a href="">2:39</a> made my heart drop.YOU CANT SHOW THAT ON YT!
Rest In Peace Steve Irwin a legend is gone.

I have the mojo deals.ahaha...

They forgot Eddie Guerrero next time do him he was a legend and everyone who died here are sad

To this day Steve Irwin’s death has to of been the worst that I could have thought of. The amount of good he could have done to the wildlife in Australia and entertainment for the Tv. If I could bring back anyone in the world it would be him. I was 6 when he died and I spent a week in my bedroom crying. RIP Steve you are loved and missed.

I’m really mad because I was watching a livestream and somebody was saying imagine being Steve Irwin oh wait I am and I’m really pissed off

<a href="">1:39</a> - <a href="">1:44</a> siri goes off LOL

Is it bad that I only know Owen Hart and Steve Irwin?

I almost threw my phone when I watched the 73 yer old man falling from a 10 story building.

Nick Menza
This commentator is so disrespectful

Steve Irwin died in 2006 not 2007.

Imagine this, 4 cheese burgers 4 people and only one coke

Some more context to Vic Morrow&#39;s death. The guys in charge of the pyrotechnics were not told about the helicopter and the helicopter pilot was not told about the pyrotechnics. The actors were killed by a failure to communicate.

Karl walenda he looks heart attack

No

R.I.P. DIMEBAG

You missed Dale Earnhardt
No.8 really Jinxed himself 

They missed Dale Earnhardt Sr. dying during a race.

R.I.P Dimebag

I feel soo bad especially when he did it for his granddaughter

paul walker

eddie gueraro
I was watching the night Owen Hart died.  Sad.  So sad.  I heard about Steve Irwin dying when I was coming home from fishing.  Also so sad.

Nahhhhhh steve&#39;s death was his fault the real story was the sting ray was swimming away and he kept going up to it the fish was scared of the camera

Tiny Tim, forgot about him. Funny guy. Miss him.

What about Dick Shawn? He died in front of an audience, too. He played LSD in the 1968 movie of The Producers. Starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.

I think you missed H.B. Halicki...

My Guinea Pig Died Today
The old guy that fell hit me hard..

Paul Walker should have been on here

I still remember when Owen hart died I was seven when it happened I remember the Tribute show on Raw is War the very next night and crying my eyes out.

The actor from Superman

Brandon Lee is so much like his dad. They’re great actors, impressive martial artists, &amp; died young at the peak of their career. 

Where is Talal Maddah?
Honorable mentions of death?  That’s just wrong in so many ways.  When I die I hope I don’t get an honorable mention.

Missed ayrton senna the legend

I cried when I got to know that Steve Irwin

Honorable mentions should have been when celebrities almost killed themselves like Bret Michaels at the Tonys

Will Jake paul die in an accident while filming?

i was going to play roblox until i saw this video, when i see the grandpa falled down, i don&#39;t even want to play roblox because my palm sweats and it made the roblox sensivity even harder

Crocdile Hunter---LOL! what a moron!  Talk about Karma catching up with you!  Most Humans DIE when they encounter a croc in the wild!  It is only natural and expected.  His guardin Angels got sick of his foolishness and had a hoover dam worth of karma to dump on him!  Die by a harmless sting ray. Most people get stung on the leg and survive!

Im guessing that racecar drivers dont count on this list, otherwise I think that Dale Earnhart would be on it

Why isn&#39;t Dale Earnhardt Sr on the list? He died performing what he did best live in front of his fans.

And yet no F1 drivers

WWE fucked up

Imagine what the guy that fell was saying wile falling

I thought Steve Irwin was just swimming with sea creatures by himself. But one of the sea creatures stabbed him in the heart.

Steve Irwin was my hero.

Did you know that steve irwin both died of blodlos and poisen

RIP to those who die

<b>(I’m 12 Ik ‘cause of coppa I shouldn’t be here)</b>                                   <b>****</b><i>I know she wasn’t famous, but a little under 3 years ago when my mom died the day before my 9th birthday, I experienced probably the worst feeling I had never in my entire life ever had. She already wasn’t doing so good healthwise, and when breast cancer finally took over, I just couldn’t really fully wrap my mind around it. It seriously hit me though that she really wasn’t here like 2 years ago. The night that I had received the news, it just seemed so unreal I almost didn’t believe it. I seriously hope whoever is reading this has an outstanding and productive day with whatever it is that you do, and that you never have to experience what I experience. If you have, you’ve got my deepest and uttermost condolences. </i>

The Brandon Lee death is not entirely accurate.

RIP Dimebag... Metal&#39;s hero

I&#39;m literally crying I can&#39;t stand this 

My parents always used to watch Tommy Cooper! Such sad that his merch is sold again for like $50.00

Selena better be #1 on top of the list

<a href="">9:07</a> no he&#39;s known as crocodile Dundee mate

When you don’t deserve to die but you’re honored.

Steve  Irwin  was a first class idiot . He new that what he did was extremely dangerous and could cost him his life one day but didn&#39;t care if he made a widow and orphans out of his family

The guy who fell off the balance wire was the hardest to watch.

tommy cooper is from my town, theres a statue of him in the town centre and his death saddens me so much :( im glad we have the statue tho and im proud to come from the same place

I&#39;d probably due watching Watchmojo 

Damn no Eddie Guerrero or Chris Benoit damnnnnn
Owen Hart.s death was indeed tragic but It was hard to believe that the pay per view continued

what about christina grimmie that was brutally murdered onstage? Shot once in the head and twice in the chest. Whoever did this was drunk

You left Timothy Treadwell, the bear Man

Wow putting ads in people&#39;s death

would paul walker count

For a second, I was like so confused why Steve Irwin&#39;s death was number two.... it made my mom cry...

You missed reggie lewis a nba player who had a heart attack during one of his games

You forgot JFK
So what do we learn today kids?Don’t fucking mess with prop pistols and guns you jackass!

Rest in peace Steve irwin mate

who else noticed that they wrote for steve irwin 1996 - 2007 which would be wrong meaning he died at 11 when he died at 44 and was born in 1962 and lived until 2006

John Lennon
WHY WASN&#39;T STEVE URWIN FIRST? THE WORLD-FAMOUS CROCODILE HUNTER WAS BLOODY IMPALED MULTIPLE BLOODY TIMES BY A BLOODY STINGRAY! HE HAD KIDS, FOR GODSAKE!!!

I am sorry but needs to be said Paul Walker :( fast and furious died during a stunt

Brandon Lee what a waste of a young talent!

<b>salutes</b>

 these people got everything they deserved 
Tommy Cooper’s death was really creepy and sad...When your actually dying and people think your doing it for a act and laugh at it...it’s truly dark and sad..

I think I&#39;m not watching this after all.

WWE put him in the HOF

The camera man s fault Steve died.

In September 2006, the first week was a very busy time at the Pearly Gates.  3 famous Australians died in that week.  Steve Irwin was mentioned in this video; who were the other two???

Tommy Cooper one of my favourites.

Hexum was a fucking dumbass...lol

I feel so sad for him. I wish it never happened. R.I.P.

RIP 

how dare Steve Irwin not be put as number 1

Micheal Jackson be like <a href="">5:40</a>

This particular video should have had redd foxx on the list not an honorable mention. He literally died on set!

Where is Paul Walker

<a href="">6:30</a> she&#39;s not just that. They raped her and killed her doing so. One by one and they&#39;re proud about it. Do not make this in to a smaller situation than it is! 

When I say dime bag as one I cried not because of the place but just him R.I.P

When you go to bed with a cough and wake up to a Dimebag Darrel concert.

I think Steve Irwin deserves number 1 but at least he was second R.I.P Steve Irwin

Dale earnhardt

Mmm I think you missed Micheal J

BRANDON LEE  omgggg

Steve Irwin

&quot;And his light will be remembered forever and ever and ever.&quot; Who?

Anyone else think Paul Walker should&#39;ve bee on this list, died while in a Porsche CGT, &#39;if one day it&#39;s the speed that kills me do not cry because I was smiling&#39; if that&#39;s not dying doing what you love then I don&#39;t know what is.

Owen Hart  My family were watching that live when it happened. I was just a kid so I don&#39;t remember if I was watching with them or not. So sad 

As far as I know Tommy coopers death has never been shown on uk TV.

BRANDON LEE WAS ASSASINATED..

Hey waht about michel jackson

i swear to god the bruce lee family is cursed

Larry Booker aka Moondog Spot died in the ring during a battle royal. There is video of it. Also, John Ritter collapsed on set of 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter and died later that night. Also not mentioned was Dale Earnhardt and countless other race car drivers who died during races. Then there&#39;s Hank Gathers who died right in the middle of a basketball game for Loyola Marymount University.

U missed the singer Selena

What about heath ledger

RIP Dimbag 
Well at least they died doing what they love 

Me dying while doing what I love:Dies in sleep

If I died doing something I loved I would die from a paper cut or being poked by a pencil from drawing, being blind from tv, or lose my voice from singing

<a href="">6:49</a>

What about Eddie Guerrero

RIP Steve Irwin

Where&#39;s the coffin dancers

Wasn&#39;t going to upvote until I saw Dimebag at number 1. RIP

ayrton senna?!
tommy cooper (no.3) with that red hat looks like Gruncle Stan from garavity falls 

If anyone ever disrespects the crock hunter, mait they won’t be walking again or even breathing.

I do think Steve Irwin should have been #1

RIP STEVE IRWIN YOU WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED

Tupac

my first thought before clicking was Harry Houdini then they say his death was actually because of something that happened before his performance????? how did I not know this?!

You missed out the joker

Wanna hear a joke?Read more
Jeremy Scott McGuire King Of Kings seeks why the evil

No Houdini! He should be #1 on the list! Crazy...

The first guy is kinda dumb no disrespect rip

Where was Ayrton Senna? One of the best F1 drivers ever who died while leading a Grand Prix!!!

<b>In the thumbnail why the fuck is he holding the alagator like a shotgun</b>

Dying doing what you love is truelly honorable

He couldve died from crocodiles, sharks and alligators but he died from a stingray..

I remember When I was A 5 years old i Was about to Fall On a Stair that was Super High But gladly I slip And was able to Sit so It save my Life If i didint sit when slipped i wouldnt be here Commenting My Dumb Doings

I&#39;d honestly choose any of these deaths...seriously... then have the one I will get next month.I&#39;m going to die of cancer and any of these is better. I&#39;m losing to something, and these people didn&#39;t lose.They won their battles.

i&#39;m a simple woman: i see Steve Irwin, i click

Dale earnheart ?

Heath Ledger....How tf did u miss him!?

Steve Irwin you were my childhood, loved you so much! RIP

This whole list could all be nascar drivers

&quot;Number 1. This Watch Mojo Presentato- wait wha-&quot;<b>Gunshot</b><b>Cuts to black</b>

My dad was there to see when Hart died. He told me about being there and how you could just see him falling, like a speck from the ceiling down to the platform.

Steve Irwin was a legend

I agree with most of the list, but I think that Dale Earnhardt should be on the list. Miss the 3

There aren&#39;t enough metalheads in here! Any other metalheads here show your love for Dimebag.

Dale Earnhardt, Ty Longley, Dan Wheldon, Paul Walker

The guitarist for Great White should be on here

I Knew Dimebag Would Be #1 , R.i.p

This might not be part of this topic so all f1 fans Stirling Moss is now dead

Owen hart’s death was truly unexpected there isn’t a day that goes by where I watch his old matches and cry especially the rivalry he had with his brother Bret.

It’s unfortunate that lives have to be lost in order to save other lives. If only mistakes could be learned without innocent lives being the cost.

You know what&#39;s sad? That they ranked these deaths.

Steve Irwin and dimebag Darrell were the worst for me

No no no not Steve no no he was to cool to be on the list

RIP, everyone who died doing something they loved or enjoyed. Will always be missed. ️

Piemario Morosini, R.I.P.
The most tragic part of Owen Hart’s death was how preventable it was

Trusting someone else to have your equipment right is letting death in on some level in your being you decided it was okay to die

Stupidity gets you dead

<a href="">8:54</a> Steve Irwin your my idol

What about Dale Earnhardt

you guys forgot about ayrton cena who died in formula one

JOHN LENNEN

The love of my life passed away two years ago.... He used to always do the scene of the heart attack &quot;Elizabeth!...&quot;.... He too died of a heart attack.  Pay attention to your blood pressure, his was high for YEARS, like, very high.  I should&#39;ve told him it&#39;s like a car that&#39;s overheating, it&#39;s gonna blow.  He was only 50.  We miss him everyday 

Shouldn’t Steve Irwin be number one?

I would&#39;ve mentioned Freddie Mercury, I mean he didn&#39;t exactly pass away whilst performing, but he tried to record as much songs as he could until he couldn&#39;t anymore.

At least they died doing what they loved

Michael Jackson
R.I.P

The Johnny Ace one always get me.

BRENDAN GRACE!

Eddie warrior?
I feel like eddie guerero should have been on here

Imagine the whole comment section full with word imagine

Who here when Kobe passed

i remember watching the over the edge ppv on that day but turned off in the middle of the hardcore title match, the match before that.....

Atleast they died doing what they liked

WTH he died acting so sad

You missed ‘Michelle Jackson’ The most famous and surely the best Rockstar. Love him always ️R.I.P

I remember watching Tommy Cooper dying on t.v. My mum changed the channel. He was so funny.

Marck from the  corners

Does watchmojo do a top 10 on every topic?

So, does JFK count? All the race car drivers? John McSherry?

<a href="">8:35</a> Imagine dying from heart attack and people laugh away thinking it is a part of the script.

It&#39;s genuinely sick and disgusting to put someone&#39;s death as a &quot;honorable mention&quot; genuine disgustingI hope the host becomes one of the honorable mentions when the make a part 2 to milk someone&#39;s death

Where Is Eddie Guerro?Latina Heat :(

Lol I might be related to Steve Irwin

Conway Twitty? He was a great American why wasn’t he included on this list whoever makes these countdowns you’re fired

This is one of many reasons I wouldn&#39;t want to be an actor

Imagine someone dying on a stage and you think it&#39;s just part of the act and laughI&#39;d feel like shit

Rip Owen hart. Not many people really talk about him anymore.

RIP the Australian crocodile hunter saved animals heal them then gave them back to the wilds hand

Too bad we lost Steve Irwin in 2006 from a stingray 7 years later we lost Paul Walker in a drag race doing the fast and furious act they were foolish nevertheless never know whatever was coming to themselves in this stupid world we are risking life and limbs that is insane pure stupidity just like the show it only hurts when I laugh but I hate it stupid people do stupid things that’s going to get them murdered or in the hospital go figure it out yourself sometime or later things don’t happen the same way you all always unconditionally forever forevermore expect hopefully you all don’t have the right to just judge us sorry buddy but people are stupid like bad drivers on the road these days assholes never nevertheless know whoever they are dealing with it’s that simple so please use common sense do things safely without losing loved ones like I did 4 years back this November on Election Day it was myself dad I love unconditionally himself and miss himself everyday unconditionally unconditionally forever forevermore. We all always have a great life but to myself calculations is it worth getting wasted and whatever we wanted it’s not going to last forever forevermore it’s not sorry peace thanks.

Imagine being the 73 year old man felling the rope wiggle and try to stop it and just falling and knowing

Micheal Jackson crushed his balls to hard

I’m kinda disappointed that Lane Frost wasn’t on this list

Scientists: Humans are evolving faster than ever!Humans: confuses manta rays with sting rays.

Steve Irwin should have been 1

73 year old made me feel like crying 
What about  Dick shawn

Disappointing that Ayrton Senna and Gilles Villeneuve weren&#39;t mentioned

Dale Earnhardt should have got a mention

Andrea the gaint

Steve lrwin was a good performance in the showes. We miss him. 

iam now upsetti spaghetti

Um she said 6ft sting ray.... 5 seconds later his best mate said 8ft... why not just make sure you say the correct length beforehand?

Redd Foxx does not deserve to be an honorable mention, he deserves more

You missed Mitsuharu Misawa.
Steve Irwin was a fool and asshole for risking life and limbs for croc hunter on animal planet sorry we lost himself forevermore forever unconditionally in 2006 rip loser but not to worry himself son Bob Robert Irwin is his doppelgänger forevermore forever and bindi Irwin are always carrying his legendary legacy rip loser hahahahaha hahahahaha whatever happens you never nevertheless know what you are going to get thanks a lot we’ll miss you unconditionally forever forevermore and blessings to you all always thanks.

U forgot dean potter
Why didn’t Carl Wallenda just hang on to the wire?

Steve Irwin didn&#39;t respect the creatures he dealt with. He thought he was invincible. If he had, he would be alive today.

STEFAN KARL STEFFASON

I miss Steve
Of the 10 deaths/causes of death, I think only #9 Karl Wallenda falling from the high wire, and #3 Tommy Cooper having the heart attack, were actually shown...although I suppose the vid publisher could conceivably get sued for showing some of the others (and/or, maybe they never aired at all). Overall, I think the concept behind this vid is pretty flawed--the title is at least somewhat inconsistent with what actually happened, in most cases. #10 Jon-Erik Hexum didn&#39;t die &quot;while performing&quot;, he was just playing around with the &quot;blanks&quot; gun in between takes. Similarly, #7 Les Harvey died BEFORE performing, if he was just doing a sound-check. #2 Steve Irwin and #5 Brandon Lee were actually filming something at the time, but it was not in front of an &quot;audience&quot; (which to me, is part of what the word &quot;performing&quot; in the title implies). Same with #6 Vic Morrow (and the two kids); I think I actually saw footage in another video of what happened to them, the crashing helicopter--they showed the helicopter going down, but not the 3 people it fell on (thankfully). Never heard of #1 &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot; (or the bands Damageplan and Pantera), or #4 Owen Hart (the wrestler), but at least their deaths were consistent with the vid concept (as I see it)--performing in front of an audience. I guess if #8 J.I. Rodale was still on the set of Dick Cavett after being interviewed (and suffered the heart attack on the set), that sort-of counts although he wasn&#39;t &quot;performing&quot; at that point.

R.I.P Christina Grimme....
Where&#39;s Eddie Guerrero?
U basteds! How dare u put Irwin on this list we rather forget the tragedy and hope his children are alright and can move on not bringing us this again! Fuck you!!! 

i remember seeing crocodile hunter the movie without even knowing Steve Irwin i noticed what a good man until i read one of the who was books i read about his death and i felt sorry and seeing him in the number 2 spots he will forever be loved (┬┬﹏┬┬)

What about Paul walker

Where is aryton Senna he is the biggest

What about Paul walker?

Steve Irwings death hadn&#39;t surpised me back then, especially the way he died. The way the guy handled animals was sometimes skin crawling. Personally I rather watched Bushtuckerman. He showed more respect for nature than mr. Irwing did. Still, it&#39;s sad that he had to die from it.

Irwin did NOT DIE TRAGICALLY...he was killed because he was an idiot....

What about John Ritter?

R. I. P Dimebag GETTCHA PULL
I know this video is old, but Sib Hasium from Boston died on a cruise while playing a set by heart attack.

Respect for putting Dimebag Darryl #1. One of the best.Rip

Vic Morrow’s and those two kids death was a horrible way to die.

Oh, for the love of - what does it take for actors to realize that a blank is fired at a speed of 50 m/s or 110 miles per hour?  And that just the explosion of gases ALONE can be deadly?

According to watch mojo, they died doing what they loved. Does that mean that the first guy loved playing Russian roulette

Sad

Oof

rip to all who died

&quot;you will die the way u lived and you will be resurrected the way u died&quot;

The dislikes are from heartless people

What about Ayrton Senna... true legend, my hero

They forgot the legend Scatman...

I can&#39;t believe it, people only mention about Steve Irwin.. and not anybody else. Think of other people too ya know, so 82% of these people are low lives. And I love Steve Irwin&#39;s Adventures, and I&#39;m not on peta&#39;s side. I want you guys to think of everyone. Thank you, :).

We’re dale?!!!!
What tragic is how Steve died by a sting ray STING RAY out of alligator hunting danger jobs, he gets stabbed into the heart by a sting ray.

No Cliff Burton from Metallica you guys really suck

What about the guy who wore the Godzilla suit?

<a href="">2:43</a> I could barely watch

Number 3 and 9 really got me

Flo Hyman should have been on here.

Who else know shes gonna make one with Kobe

bruce lee and son brandon lee both died while acting

Tommy Cooper was the one to make me cry

I remember the day Steve died. I just sat in my room watching the entire series trying not to cry. I watched him growing up, and deep down, when Steve told his director he was dying, in the back of my mind, I would think &quot;Steve wouldn&#39;t have wanted the animal to die.&quot;

Hey peta fuck you 
In summary!! You try your best to please and entertain people who’ll forget you minutes after you die !!!!!

Christina Grimmie
Michael Jackson??
Steve Irwin had zero respect for wild animals and nature. His goal was to show spectacularly how to play with wild animals without keeping them at a distance with dignified respect.
I thought Eddie Guerrero would of been on here ...

Hol up

Is Hudini here?

Dale Earnhardt sr
Rip Steve 
Avicii died doing what he loved, doing drugs

When I see this kind of stuff I can&#39;t help but think about Jakie Chan,what if one day he just falls at the wrong angle or gets hit too hard?

if I ‘died doing what I loved’ I’d probably choke while eating oreos or something

Bro I’m from Puerto Rico idk this happened

I miss Steve Irwin so much
