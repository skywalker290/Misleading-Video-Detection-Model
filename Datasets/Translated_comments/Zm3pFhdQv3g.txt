Matilda has changed so much

Sydney is my sisters name 😎👌

This was such a great show.. I wish Netflix didn’t cancel it. This was a hit and very promising. Netflix always disappoints me 🤦🏻‍♀️

Is this TEOTFW American version?

I will never forgive you Netflix for canceling this show

Why’d you cancel this show Netflix! &gt;:(Pleeeeeaaassseee make a second season!! I really loved this!

Is this a movie or tv show?

I need a second season !

mfs cancelled this show. it had so much potential

I NEED ANOTHER SEASON WHY THE HELL DID YALL CANCEL THIS MASTERPIECE 👹
Whoever decided to cancel this show need they ass beat (disrespectfully)🤞🏾

I always thought she was a lesbian

We need Season 2

When I saw the nose bleed my first thought was eleven ( stranger things )

Carrie white basically

You guys at Netflix are stupid for canceling this show it was an amazing show. I’m not okay with that

is it only me that thinks she looks like elizabeth olsen&#39;s younger sister

I admire sophia lillis

Wassini ni Best la story
&quot;from the producer of stranger things&quot;I see where that is.

This is a great show: writing, cast, acting, locations and soundtrack all wonderful, and I loved Stan (Wyatt Oleff) - he&#39;s a &quot;Timothée Chalamet&quot; I didn&#39;t want to kick in the groin!

haha head go boom
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Hbd!!! ianowt yesterday

Is no one gonna say that she lookin like Carrie?

WE NEED A SECOND SEASON NOW

Dude I just wanna know two things that - 1st - why Sophia always get rolls where she have to bath with blood? 2nd why waytt got rolls where he got name Stanley in every movie?!!!

Pennywise let her cut her hair because she&#39;s crying 😭😭

She is James and Alyssa&#39;s daughter👀😳

SUCKSES BAD ASS

i was so exited when i saw this trailer and waited for it to come out but now its fing canceled BRUH NETFLIX WTF CANT YOU JUST WAIT TILL COVIDS OVER OMLL

cavities 2020?
Yeah, but...season 2!!! Come on!

disgusting movie

It has canceled 😣💔

is it good to watch ??

Renew IANOWT season 2 NOWWWWWW!!!!!!!

I am in this scene!!

Ohhhh come on Netflix,, you guys have your YouTube channel, Facebook page, Instagram account,, account in any social medias....... You even release trailer of any movie or any series..... Then why don&#39;t you just release movies and  episodes ofseries? ¿????????????!?! 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲

<a href="">2:40</a> me : * that not funny*

I wish they made more episodes

The movie was cool
I saw the first season, it was very beautiful
its based on a comic by charles forman (sorry if i spelled his name wrong) and he actually made TEOTFW and IANOWT so if they are similar thats why :)

Sk sk sk and I oop

I love that all the comments here forget that she said that she was a “boring, 17- year-old, white girl. I’m not special...” She put emphasis on the word “white,” but it just rolled off of everyone. The fact that no one noticed that race is written into the opening line and no one cared, gives me hope for a post racial future right there.

This reminds me of life is strange. AND I LOVE IT !!!!!!

Oof. Kinda reminds me of me and my friend. Except the roles are switched I&#39;m friends with her bf.

I love you 😍 <b>Sophia Lillis</b>
WHERE CAN I WATCH IT FOR FREE????

It&#39;s cool that the songs fits perfectly in each scene! For example, the part when Sidney says &quot; I&#39;m not special, that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say&quot; and the the song in the back says &quot;I&#39;m not like everybody else&quot;. Or the part when she is talking about Dina, and the song sings about someone falling in love for another person

She is mixed genes of Carrie, Eleven, Matilda and Alyssa

Are they going to confirm the 2nd season??😭
<a href="">2:36</a> I still don’t get the joke

Can i watch it in lap top? It kinda got my attention I&#39;m interested in it

why am i watching this? I already finished the season.

<a href="">4:37</a> that was the most adorable laugh I’ve ever heard

Was this filmed in dairy

Gorgeous
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that she’s basically chloe price with telekinetic powers. like.

Love this show so much  &lt;3

I like this actress, but it&#39;s so millennial and also Carrie..Not really clicking for me.

Sydney+Dina for season 2 I don’t care it’s just what I want!

I only see Sydney take the bus once...

I wanna watch it but Idh netflix😭😭😭

This is basically the whole episode I mean-

Life is strange 3?

I  LOVE YOUR movie

She&#39;s like Eleven!!😁
This kinda makes me think of carrie, and Life is strange

<a href="">0:13</a> the blood and chains remind me of the death trial in the 100 by Octavia

It&#39;s kind of fun that the entire season is even shorter than a long movie, but I still love it!

I am not okay with just 7 minutes of this! I&#39;m watching the rest of it!

The end of the f***king head of brad

dfe ye rk`df
I think it&#39;s pretty goddamn obvious she lesbian.  The writers could&#39;ve been more subtle about it but I guess they want it to be easy to tell.

Dear netflix,I do love ur I am not okay with this series!! Sooooo much! But please please please, I want Syd and Stanley become a thing❤️ i mean, their chemistry is so strong like James and Alyssa from The End of Fxxxing World, really.. okay maybe she is a lesbian, im not a homophobic but the chemistry between Syd &amp; Dina is not as strong as with Stanley to be honest.. I need partner-in-crime-and-in-love series again.... i’m craving for james-alyssa kinda thing... please 😭

the beginning looks like the MV of &#39;&#39;stupid&#39;&#39; by ashnikko lmao

Is this Carrie as a show?

This is an request to Team NETFLIX to make web series on SHRI CHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJA .

Anything about Season 2

saiki kusuo but more life action than the life action it self

honestly, the show really snapped. don&#39;t mind the comments lmaooo.

K but like I’m still waitin for another episode😕

totally remind me of CARRIE 😅

She look like girl in the IT movie !!!

<a href="">1:06</a> Is that you, Carrie?

I HAVE TO WATCH THIS

just a spoiler: THE DANCE IS MINDBLOWING

Does anyone else get a Freaks and Geeks vibe?

Nah this defo is set sometime during the late 80s-early 90s; you can feel the vibe.

IT Chapter 3 lookin wack ngl
You’re not ok with this sneak peek? Why upload it then!?

covered with blood!!! again

I like it 🙂💛
She is beautiful!!

I finished it a few days ago...shit

I&#39;m gonna watch it tommorow..

Looks like Carrie grew up
This show is metaphorically good 👍

I love how she sounds like Helga from Hey Arnold

Carrie issss thattt youuuu?!??!

I want more

Where is season 2?!?

<a href="">6:11</a> playing with straw, <a href="">6:15</a> not playing with straw, <a href="">6:17</a> playing with straw

Please post EPISODE HERE

When tf is season 2 out already!!?

Not just a lesbian but interracial lesbians typical libtards   Trump 2020 💪🇺🇸
SPOILERS(Theory):What if the shadow man at the end is the one who causes things to move whenever she gets angry, so Syd, in actuality doesnt have any powers? It would explain why they come out of nowhere.

It’d be funny if this is somehow connected to Stranger Things and Sydney is 007 or somethingOr maybe she’s like Eleven in an alternate universeDon’t take me seriously I’m just bull-shitting

Gaaaaaay

Isn&#39;t this girl who plays susie in the chilling adventures of sabrina ?

Isn’t that the same hallway in to all the boys?

The series before was great than this

the 204 dislikes are from people who tought it will be full episode

Why does she still keep that lesbian hair

I just finished watching season 1 and im here to read the comments

this show is absolute shit

I thought they were turning iT into a TV show haha and then I thought they were turning Carry into a TV show

PLS NETFLIX UPLOAD SEASON TWO I ALREADY FINISHED THE WHOLE SEASON YESTERDAY

i finished the season, it was beautiful. i love it

Is she a lesbian?

This show has life is strange vibe and not the stranger things kind of story IT IS GOOOD

THIS SHOW IS AMAZING

She looks like Beverly from IT COOOL

Always covered with blood

Im here to say that I&#39;ve already watched it and lived it ❤

lol the ending makes me wonder, if i have powers lol

Sorta like Dead Like Me but...perkier.

It’s cause my dad sort of died

Am I the only one who didn&#39;t like this show?? I gave up after watching 4 episodes

Binged the whole thing in one sitting, make episodes longer please, the acting is phenomenal, loved the potential of this, moar please! ...

SEASON 2 PLEASE!!!! JUST FINISHED 7 EPISODES WITHIN 3 HRS 😭😭😭😭😭
She’s covered in blood once again...

uMm is no one talking about that ending? That was pretty mind blowing!Ahaha...... you see what i did there?

bruh she came from the upside down

I havent even seen the show and i already ship the two girls

Good show. Too short of a season.

I hate whit teenagers. AND I AM ONE!!!😱

If ur not ok with this sneak peek, then why post it?

<b>This serie is MINDBLOWING, amazing!!!!!</b>

Where's the fun scene?
THIS IS THE REAL PENNYWISE

Im waiting for season 2 already

What is this elevens clone?

i remember Carrie to this movie

i thought it was just a whole romance movie but in the last scene...God it was scared!

The ending was 🤯

She got clowns chasing her and she still got Stan by her side

Loved this series but, way to short!

This is some Carrie shit

Really Good Duration Of The Series,Like It.

Season 2 pleaseeee

I am laughing on the outside... crying on the inside.... 🎶🎶Oops... wrong show! 😆

Sidney is so very obviously GAY I AM HOWLING

She&#39;s the female version of James(teotfw) with superpowers

Its the <b>&quot;Im a BORING 17 year old white girl&quot;</b> that made it Interesting Lets All tell the truth

if u love TEOTFW u would also lov this

I just finished it and I’m in many questions like is the shadow guy her dad and is there going to be a next season I’m just confused

i love this

Season 2 please

how original....

Love this vid just saw this on tiktok!!!!

The first one looks like carrie reference

I watched the entire 7 episodes in a day

Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

999.. comments oops I ruined it now 910.

I want to see this girl on strager things

the Carrie remake looks good

Oh mini series from it

Wow this is like half the episode

Would I be gay if I watched this?

time to boycott netflix yall...

Why is it that all of Sophia characters undergo extreme trauma? I just want her to be happy :(

Sydney is the hardcore eleven

Let me &#39;guess&#39;, she&#39;s of sapphic persuasion.

I see a mix of Carrie White and Beverly Marsh

Love the Carrie vibes, think i may start watching this 🤔🤩Update : i just watched the entire 1st season and there better be a season two. Whos the smoke guy 🥺

This is actually good. Watch worthy

Oh wait let me guess...another lesbian thing ? Sure

Luv Stranger Things. Also Im not against cursing and cussing. But! This show should be titled the angry  Fk /Sht series. All it is is boring constant ceaseless cursing taking the place of any creativity dialogue. There is no creativity or interesting dialogue. And i watched thru to the end, hoping it would improve, and morbidly curious. So, Im NOT OK WITH THIS😄

Bro, I finished this show the first day, I can’t wait for the next season!

she murders dinas boyfriend. that’s who’s blood it is

I’ve just finished this, it was great

Shit was so short

Omg the show is amazing!!.. What i am supposed to do until season 2?

carrie lol
Carrie ?????
Waiting for season 2 lol

She picks roles where she has to cover herself in blood lol

&quot;I&#39;m a bored seventeen years old girl&quot;So why do you look like Carrie after dancing?

Episode is too short

I watched every episodes without Netflix

bitches waited a whole year for this to come out just to watch it in one day. it’s me i’m bitches.

Netflix original  you have have to upload episode 1 than people want to watch the whole season

That ending. Holy shit.

I don’t care if everyone thinks this is some recycled version of TEOTFW, Stranger Things, It, and Carrie. Because I love the vibes. I never really had anything that I quite enjoyed as much as I enjoy TEOTFW. But this I enjoy as much as I do TEOTFW. I tried watching Stranger Things far too many times but the length of the episodes and the amount there are is just difficult for me to watch. I’ve watched It and it was good, still not the same vibes though. And I can’t say I’ve ever seen Carrie but just because she gets covered in blood doesn’t mean it’s a recycled thing. It’s more of a reference to Carrie.

This show is amazing, I need a second season right now! Also, does this remind any of you of Impulse/Henrietta?? Strange powers coming out when you are emotional, accidentally hurting people, weird guy following you that you think is going to hurt you but is actually just trying to help? It&#39;s different but definitely shares some amazing characteristics!

Good series Season 2 when ?

CEO of 🤯
This is literally like TOTFW and Stranger Things 🙄 Gets tiring

What name of that serial Is?

Sophie lilies is weird nobody likes her

Well Sophia,Here you are...Covered head-to-toe in fake blood......again.

I would NEVER ever date someone who was an asshole to my friend. That shows that they’re really not thinking nor caring about your feelings.

I hate Sophie lilies
<b>now only if they uploaded the whole season....</b>

The ending moves so fast and OMG it&#39;s so goooooood

WHEN IS S2 COMING OUT

This series really is screaming of &quot;What if Wes Anderson tackles comic book movie&quot;. From the framing, slo-mo, color palette, soundtrack choices. Really, you have to see it yourself.

I don’t know why everyone is making bad jokes about this but i think that i really like it

This serial is Stranger things mixed with It

This is like me except with the powers

Bio

Only i can carry it around in mass effect tribute video games i made in fact i own the market the best selling in all consoles plus theater too op cartoons etc

Yeah its super high tech any fraud

Its a portable set i made op on seize like walk around hunted house but micro town

Crap

As in main girl op on fright to sheet in its scary op pop out of

Want to star in the new one

Probably youlls cousins op on who knows

at first i thought it was just a teotfw rip-off... but holy shit the superpowers

<a href="">5:31</a> 🤯🤯🤯
anger like Alyssa and powers like eleven huh 😂♥️ and boredom like James.

She still has that blood om

I wonder why they got this actor and covered her in blood and also got the actor of kid Stanley to be her best friend in this show?wow and she hides in the bathroom during class

Whats with her and blood : ((

Ok so the ending is what convinced me to go over to Netflix

I guess she never really cleaned off that blood from. IT

Lame. We already have Eleven &amp; she is a way better telepath.

This show was amazing but entirely way too short. Now I hafta wait a whole year 😩

Hope they release part 2 soon . It was so good

It’s gonna be “mind blowing” 😆lol

This is the best thing ever. I am addicted. I need this now😂

we be gettin another eleven 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻

just finished it. and its gooddd

<b>&#39;DEAR DIARY~GOOO F*CK YOURSELF!</b> 😐😅😂 <b>YUUUP THIS IS INDEED A NETFLIX SHOW &amp; IT &#39;IS&#39; REALLY ONE HELLUVA SHOW!</b> <b>JUST FINISHED WATCHING IT &amp; I WANT TO REWATCH IT AGAIN.</b> <b>CYD IS FRICKEN AWESOME!</b> 💖 <b>LoveAlways</b> 💙 <b>KareBear</b>
My insomnia is cured by watching this show.

Who is okay with this?

okay PLOT TWIST : what if sydney is eleven’s other sister she could be related to her  AU ver. asdfghjkl

I literally watch The first season already once it came out on Netflix I watched it that day and I was done with it it’s such a good show I suggest you guys to watch it.

Finished in one sitting. Dope Show

Nobody:Brad: 🤯
Man I thought Jesse Eisenberg was too rich for Netflix. Or is this Michael Cera??

Hey Netflix!! How about next time u give us longer episodes.😑

I was going to watch anyways, but now I&#39;m going to wach more.

I&#39;m so hype for this show already.

I watched this show because of Sophia and Wyatt. I&#39;m already ready for season 2.

I am only gonna watch this because this seems amazing and it’s by the same director of TEOTFW

Finished the series in one night it&#39;s. Soooooooo soooooooo good

Netflix has developed a formula for their series aimed for teens. It&#39;s repetitive and unoriginal. After watching Euphoria, It&#39;s hard to go back to this kind of show.

I tried so hard to paste myself with the episodes but welp 🤷🏽‍♂️And imagine releasing a new series and in less than like 5 hours the show has made it to #2 in top 10 in US

Bro I’m over thinking bout this show who tf was that that guy at the end of episode 4 the show is very very good

No spoilers y’all, but the ending is <b>mind blowing.</b>

They tried it with seven episodes :/ I watched the whole thing during a college lecture

No matter what movie or show Stans  in his name is always Stan

Great show can’t wait for season two hopefully Netflix u make more episodes and make them longer and I’m so happy for Sophia lillis she is a queen

I finished the whole season in less than 3 hours. You better make s2 I swear lmao.

Youtube : i am not ok with this sneak peak .me : ya me too 😕

Average

Me: sees thumbnail... carrie white? Is that you?

Small town PA gang

I literally finished this in a day. Sigh... guess I’ll wait till next year

I’m glad I’m not the only one pissed because the episodes are so short. It should have been 7 episodes but 40 min eachNot gonna lie tho. It’s a good show.

Watched it! Anybody notice the music lyrics in some scenes fit perfectly in what the characters are thinking? That&#39;s pretty neat.

Everyone is giving this show a lot of shit but honestly I liked it

What if this tv-show was a secret sequel to Scanners.

This has such a 70s/80s vibe but yet it&#39;s set in nowadays? Especially the dressing style. So confused

Wait is that the place in riverdale?!

She&#39;s just looking like Scarlett Johnson.. isn&#39;t she? Or is it only me?

When you finish the serie the same day it was released.

i am so disappointed with the ending omg.

Do you think she&#39;d make a great Batgirl

So is this an alternate universe of eleven or the daughter of el in the future of stranger things when mike dies? This is just a joke btw

Looks good but why every protagonist must be gay nowadays ? I don&#39;t get , and it feels like I don&#39;t have to.

I watched all the episodes yesterday

Yo Netflix, why you ain&#39;t putting me inside of the app?

was cool with this show until they pushed that lesbian angle like they keep doing with every single show. thumbs down @Netflix

She gives me Ellen Page vibes.

I NEED NETFLIX I HATE WHEN IM BROKE

I cant find this on netflix

In what year is this story based on? I&#39;m confused.

Literally watched this whole season after work, so good 😀

second episode in...i think its really good so far but i think all the superpower buildups kind of takes away from the charm of it... what do you guys think?

this series reminds me of, stranger things (eleven), the end of the f**king world, matilda and carrie.btw, i know the producers on stranger things and the director of the end of the F***ing world was involved.

Awesome

Reminds me of movie Carrey.....Just 7 episodes with 20 min RT each wtf!!!!I need more!!!!!!!!!!!!!lllllllllllllllll

the series is way better than the graphic novel! so go watch it!

The end of the f cking world or I am not okay with this ?

watched it today and didnt like it at all! boring and meaningless

Who already finish ?
So it’s Carrie: The Series

The End of the F***ing World but Stranger Things version

Just binged it and LOVED it. You&#39;re gonna have to hurry up with a second season.

Make a season 2 please.

Just watched full season like it&#39;s a Movie.I think it takes 1 week to shoot 😁

Why did I think Pennywise came again and did smth?😂💀

I&#39;m already ready for season 2 😂

I love Dina, can she be my friend

carrie

So her dad died and beverlys dad died, she was in blood and so was Beverley, same hair and maybe changed her name and then went to a new school, I know it’s not but we can pretend 😂

Eleven plays in TEOTFW Universe

Max Caulfield stop doing this shit

eh it was ok very predictable

I&#39;m so excited to see Wyatt and Sophia in a netflix series ❤

One of the Netflixs best ... I really hope Netflix move in direction away from the book...The source material is awful n the ending sucks

Frens : this is Leftist Anti- White Male propaganda

I just finished the series and omm................ it really does go out in a bang

Great show.  But really...?  7 episodes?  You guys are getting lazy.  I miss the 90&#39;s.. when shows had 20+ episodes per season! Now days we&#39;re lucky if we get 10... STEP IT UP!!! It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if we didn&#39;t have to wait a year for the following season.

Netflix and edgy teen TV Shows, name a more iconic duo.

End of the F*cking World you mean?

Youre not 17 year old youre 27 year year old

This reminds me of carrie

Why does thua give me stranger things vibes

Im Gonna watch this but...the whole making his nose bleed with her mind, just feels to much like Stranger Things, and the vibe of the show has a IT/stranger things vibe, like its trying to copy them or something

Just like the title I AM NOT OKAY WITH THE ENDING

That ending though 😳😳😳

So when is season 2 coming out

“I am not okay with this sneak peak”

im the 129 dislike

This show gives me huge life is strange vibes! The music and everything! Super edgy lol!

I need another season tho! Brad literally shocked me at the end tho! 🤯 It ended when it just started getting good tho!

I watched the whole entire season in a couple of hours. And damn, this show is amazing and really grapchic and shows you what a teenager is going through. Including she has telekinesis and can&#39;t control it. I am not gonna spoil for people.

Is this Carri

<a href="">5:35</a> literally me

Sophia Lillis is just 18 and so awesome.

I am getting  major Carrie vibes from this

Done, finished in about two hours😂🤣

Netflix: 7min watch freea tone of people: <b>watched the whole season for free</b>

Omg just got done finishing this whole season of this show and omg why couldn’t they have more episodes than 7 ugh I absolutely loved it 😩👏🏻

<b>Dear Dairy</b> It remembered me my 2017.

<a href="">3:50</a> for a second there, I thought she was going to be run over with that corner as a blindspot

When we will see season 2

Lmaooo i watched all of session 1 yesterday it was actually a really good show i can relate to a lot of things in it i rate it 5 star its a very good show ❤❤ but the port when she latterly potted that guys head was pretty 😬😬 idk what to say just very unexpected😬

Placebo

<a href="">0:38</a> seconds in and it already brings up skin colour seriously the over focusing on skin colour is just going to make the world more racist

Im always ends
He is like steve from stranger things season 1 I used to hate Steve now I also hate him

Why are the episodes so short

I love it

Pretty good . Actually like it.

Fabulous show! Here’s to hoping that season 2 will be longer than season 1.

Watched it at once today :D I hope u will make secod season qwq

<a href="">4:05</a> senörita&#39;s restaurantHey shawila
same shit same shit same shit

I -

This show was filmed in my home town, and some scenes using my local bowling alley! I didn’t realize that until I read the a sign in front of my bowling alley that said “Look for us on February 26th, “I am not okay with this”. How awesome is that?

Its not out in the philippines 🤧😭😭😭😭

Carrie reincarnated
I need season two right now. Loved it.

I WATCHED IT ITS AWSOME PLEASE WATCH IT IF YOU CAN

The comments are stupid, I think she feels completely different to her IT character, I absolutely love this!! She&#39;s incredible!

IT WAS FRICKING AMAZING!!!!!!!! Stan all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!

is this a story of 17 years old girl with supernatural power? how come nobody make a movie about this before

Stanley still Stanley even when he ain&#39;t in IT lmfao anyways loves my 2 actors from IT

i finished watching it yesterday and its actually a really good show

Worth your time. I enjoyed it.

So this entire Season is basically equivalent to 1 episode of Life is Strange. I can’t wait for Episode 2 of Life is Strange.

The fact that I binged this in 1 night I-

Seems like a cool series ,might watch

when I saw the blood I thought: El? El, where r u?

SPOLIERS!at first i thought this show was gonna be basic girl gets super powers and kills someone...oh thats what happened?...its still good

When release the second season??

Damn they came out strong dissing TVD from the jump of the first episode lol

cooooool

OH MY LAWD.. its Eleven but the other person gets the nosebleed...👏👏👏

The moment I saw her covered in blood from episode one and  hear the word prom. I was like &quot; wait is this a Carrie TV show?&quot;

This series was so great I loved it. There should definitely be a second season:))))

This show is great I hope they make another season! 😎👍

Van Helsing season 5 release date plz

sophia is so pretty

The episodes were not that long but each one was perfect this series is amazing 🙌

This show is definitely somethin else i did not expect for that to happen in the final ep wtf i hope they come out with a season 2 😱🙌

Go on
I&#39;m on the 5th episode now so far so good I love how it&#39;s just simple and short

THIS WAS SOOO GOOD!

I just binge watched this its amasing

IT 3 LOOKS TERRIFYING!

This looks good

Just binge-watched the whole show but I hate myself for binge-watching it.

I’ve already watched the whole season today and LOVED IT I woke up extra early to watch it and I couldn’t put down my phone at school it was so gooooood😅❤️❤️❤️😌😊

Is this like carrie??

I loved it!  I need a season 2!

The ending was some <b>Carrie</b> shit. 🤯 Hopefully there&#39;s a season 2 in the works. 🙏🏻🤞🏻 I prefer this series than <b>The End of The F**king World</b>

Where&#39;s season ll ?I think the lesbian thing is ok but when is Jessica Chastain going to appear?

so 80% of this series is about lesbian and LGTBBFJR meh!

It&#39;s like Matilda meets Carrie...

So is it 7 episodes or 8

Why it&#39;s like The end of the f****ING world ?

I'm waiting for the next season, I liked the first one
Binged the whole season in one sitting, this better get a season 2 or I rage! That ending though wtf!!

The background music in the cafe is awesome

Honestly after finishing this show I’m kinda pissed, it was REALLY REALLY good, freaking awesome writing and everything but because there was only 7 episodes I feel lost and annoyed because I want more. like WHY only 7 episodes at 24 minutes and less?? You should’ve just made it a movie if you were gonna make it that short 💀 now I’m gonna have to wait for GOD knows how long just to get off of a fricken cliff hanger 💀💀💀🙄🙄 I would be better off had I just waited 1-2 years from now when this MAYBE has a part 2 and watched it then 🙄🙄🙄

Why do all these shows have the same type of narration? It&#39;s repetitive, cliche and boring.

I really like Stan here!! He&#39;s so cool,  not to mention sweet! And her brother too

I accidentally watched the entire season tonight. So, there&#39;s that.

LMAO I finished the whole season already it was soooo good❤️❤️

awesome 😭

just binged all of this. super good!!! i hope there’s a season 2

I already finished the show and i already want season 2

I’m just here to read the references to Beverly Marsh &amp; Pennywise in the comments.

this looks so cringey omg

Is the opening node to carrie

They had so many “IT” references in the show it’s crazy

Same story New actress ???Itna toh suryavansham dekhkar pareshan nahi 😅😅😅
I couldn&#39;t stop but thinking if this is possibly a part of the Stranger Things franchise/universe... There are too many similarities. Yes I know it has the producers behind stranger things. But that may just increase the chance this is the same universe... Just in the 2020s rather than 80s... Her abilities are pretty much the same as elevens. Not just that but strange beings being able to teleport with flickering lights. It&#39;s possible that the dude in the end followed her via upside down.

🙄🙄🙄 Netflix needs help smh
Is it me or is every cool kid called Bradley Davis in movies

Is this show any good?

It was the best Wednesday of my life, what a Carrey-the-Strange vibe with 90s nostalgia. Apart from the way they approached her sexuality in such a natural way. I loved it, I want more soon, Ms. Netflix
Official music on my channel

Eleven v Sydney lets make it happen Netflix

Just finished watching...🙄🙄

Super powers in the hands of a delusional traumatized dysphorian can only end one way. Insanity ---&gt; Chaotic murder/suicide.

I need season 2 now💀🤩
I finished the show and holy shit-

So... Season 2 is on the way, right?

Same blood :)

She’s elevens sister😂
OMG!!! This will be my new TV show obsession for 2020. Watching from London UK.

<a href="">6:35</a> THAT WAS A ELEVEN MOVE 👏
Yo Netflix copyright strike this. This dude posted your show

Edgy teen unlocks her stand potential

I’m getting stranger things vibes

Pleeeaaaaase Hurry up and give us season 2❤️❤️❤️❤️
i just watched the whole show in less than a day and now im obsessed, specially with stan

Wtf? This looks like they copy and paste the end of the fuc**ing world, Carrie and stranger thingsBruh Netflix is definitely out of ideas

I’m predicting another Carrie rising up if we&#39;re not careful...

When she said dear diary I instantly thought of heathers

teotfw vibes

How often does this poor lass have to get covered in blood? Can somebody be typecast for that sort of thing? &quot;We need a girl to get covered in blood...&quot; &quot;I saw this movie where that happened. We could get her...&quot;

I like this

i really wanted to like it but this felt like the longest 7m16s of my life

This show looks like a parody of everything Netflix has ever released

Is anyone getting Carrie Vibes

does anyone know when this show takes place? because the whole thing seems like it takes place in the 80’s but then they use modern technology and it’s so confusing 😂

Please join the “We all hated Brad anyway” club.

She&#39;s literally Olive Oyl in the comics. Plain, tall, stringy black hair, gawky and a complete self-centered bitch about how hard her life is while ignoring everyone else&#39;s problems. Hollywood casting strikes again.

they probably didn&#39;t cast Millie Bobby Brown and Finn wolfhard as Dina and Brad because they knew we couldn&#39;t handle it

I NEED THAT SEASON 2

What is up with episode 8 there?

Who’s here after that girls tiktok

Superb... love it..👍👍
This reminds me Carrie

Looking forward for this one ...!!!!!!! SOO exciting

Don’t worry, I’m not okay with this sneak peak too

So...she lives in johnstown?

I already finished it and it’s not really like teotfw like everyone says I wouldn’t really compare her character to Jessica’s(Alyssa)

THIS SHOW WAS SO GOOD

I need more bro I watched it all hope there&#39;s a season 2

i stayed up on a <b>school night</b> to watch this, and i’m very okay with this.

OH MY GOD SHE IS SOOO EDGY!!!!

THIS SHOW IS SICKKKKKKK I LOVE ITTTTT

Netflix is feeding off of teens addiction with quirky weird teen movie’s

Her and 11 should be friends

Brad’s a smug douche. Yet still Hot AF. LMFAO.

JUST FINISHED IT AN NOW IM LIKE 🤔🤔🤔
I highly recommend. I can&#39;t wait for season 2

I just watched the whole season in one day

Already finished...... absolutely loved it...... the ending though.... clearly hate us.... when’s season two happening is what I’m saying?.?.....??

Thank you Netflix for casting actors who actually look like teenagers.I grew up watching The OC and one tree hill where grown ass adults played teenagers!!!

It was ... headblowingI need season 2 waiting superpower

Just watched all season, it was ..... headblowing))

I just couldn&#39;t get into this. It felt so cliche and try-hard. I also feel like the main actress just doesn&#39;t have star quality. Maybe I&#39;m old.

Well. I have watched the whole series yet.

Cant wait for season 2 :)Like of you agree.

i binged the whole thing. i wish there were more episodes

What&#39;s up with Netflix and these teen dramas?

this is literally like stranger things

Am I the only one who came here after watching the whole series?? 🙃

just finished watching the first season!! the ending was <i>mind-blowing</i>

The beginning’s giving me Carrie vibes ngl

This is awesome thank you NetFlix

whats with sophia and blood?

amazing series :) loved every second of it ... season 2 let go!

Good story 👍👌
genial cooool
OMG I NEED TO WATCH THIS

I’m on episode 3 and it’s already so damn good and surprisingly relatable

Is it potraying  the 80&#39;s or just the fashion?

I watch it all today when i came back from school😁. Man, you guys did a great job casting! The scene with the exploding head was on POINT and i lowkey laughed during it 😂! Season 2??😏

I live in that town

HER FACE HAHAHAH I love her facial expressions

I watched it last night it took me like 2 hours and half to watch the whole season.

This gives me The End of the f&#39;ing World vibes

Soooooo a shitty stranger things ripoff?

Sold

I love how there is 2 characters from IT here really cooll

Just watched it in 1 sit, literally is my favorite series right now  holy shit. SEASON 2  WHEN????????

Amber goes back
Is this a Carrie show????

I got up at 2am the moment it came and snd watched it twice before school

Went past the 7th episode and thinking there was an 8th lol

Looks boring as hell.

If Carrie had a daughter

IM ON EPISODE 2 AND I LOVE IT

I really miss teotfw and hope it will be just as great❤ greetings from Poland🇵🇱😘

Boohoo Max
SHE HAS BLOOD ALL OVER HER BODY BECAUSE SHE BLOWS UP BRAD’S HEAD (DINA’S BOYFRIEND) BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT TO EXPOSED HER TO EVERYONE ABOUT HER DIARY

Did someone clone molly ringwald? I didn&#39;t know that was allowed!

Best marketing :D its the serial is good. Buy netflix its worth it :)

When she said she&#39;s not special I was like please I know you bout to have some kind of powers Lol!

Just finished watching the show....im shaking.

I loved every second of this show

If her and Dina don&#39;t end up together I&#39;m calling in the lawyers and suing.EDIT: Well.... I guess they&#39;ll have the day off. I&#39;m quite satisfied.

I have just watched the whole of season 1. I WANT SEASON 2 RIGHT NOW!!!!

Coming for elevens brand
Was anyone else bored with this series?
I just finished binge watching it then I loved it I can&#39;t wait for a second season

Oh cool edgy teen not special at all, hates everyone ohhhh swears a lot siiick (I&#39;m still gonna watch the entire show, I love the actress just teasing)

Holy Shit. This is Carrie as a series.

I liked the previous trailers but now I know I&#39;m gonna love this series. I think Netflix and I are &quot;going steady&quot; now. Sweet. ❤😍

HIS HEAD😳
SEASON TWO??? PLEASE SOON OMG, I FINISHED SEASON 1 AN IT‘S MY FAVORITE SHOW🥺😻
Theory: Eleven is looking for other numbers. This could be one ; if not, why is the people who made made stranger things apart of this

Guess who already finished it;)

Looks interesting. I&#39;m also curious about the graphic novel.

I’ve had a lot of best friends and I’ve never described them like that

I want her to team up with Eleven so bad

UGH I CANT WATCH IT RIGHT NOW CUZ IM IN SCHOOL 😭😭
I thinks she’s bev from it

So she’s gay asf right

Does anybody notice when she is touching the straw <a href="">6:12</a> - <a href="">6:22</a> and when the camera points at him, she isn’t doing it. lol

Ah! She’s in love with Dina! How cuteeeee

<a href="">2:07</a> Idk but everything is like IT reference for me now...

This looks so good already, excited to finally watch it! 🤗💜

the whole series was like a pilot episode

the show just came out, i haven&#39;t even watched it yet and i already want a second season

I want the season 2... NOW

she is covered in blood, seems to have no idea how to look sexually attractive and seems to have mind powers... is this a carrie adaptation?

Lol i already watched season 1 💀

Aa aaa t&quot;gay&quot;chi
They released the series Merlí no da, put it on, they released it this day 2/26 :&#39;&#39;&#39;(
I almost watched it, and I liked it 😁 pretty good show. So waiting for season 2 ~~

<b>Looks like Life is Strange 3 has much better graphics.</b>

So El is now in high school? Lol.

Teotfw vibe right here

Dear Diary,I&#39;m not okay with this !.

I wonder if she commits suicide in the end like the comics but I doubt it

<b>WE WANT THE SEASON 2 NOW</b>

Lol definitely checking it out

I made his nose bleed, with my mind🌚😌💁‍♂️ dope af🔥
&quot;I&#39;m a BORING 17 year old girl&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not SPECIAL&quot;.....yeah.....sure........we knooooo how it startssss

<b>N I C O L A S    D U B O U S Q U E T</b>I can&#39;t wait to watch it I hope it will be to my taste this series and as a bonus we have the two actors of the Stephen King film

I can’t wait for season 2

“I’m a boring 17 girl” Like you saw a shape shifting killer clown and then almost killed it.

I just finished the show ITS VERY GOOD but i didn&#39;t get the ending lmao😂😂

So she was a bitch for no reason omfl being smug doesn’t mean he deserved to have a bloody nsoe

Another high school drama. Smh. Stop it.

I get teotfw vibes watching this

Netflix what is it with you and mind powers

I LOVE THIS SM

I’m finished.
This show is so good!!!

Hhhhh egybest
&quot;The End of The F**king world&quot; + &quot;Carrie&quot; US Edition??

WHAT TO TALK ABOUT THIS SERIES THAT I HAVE ALREADY WATCHED AND KNOWED, JUST COMES 2 SEASON

Sometimes I tell teenagers to beat me up so I can feel like their meat

I want her to show that damn tattoo on her wrist

Please keep posting first minutes of your new series... That was a great idea!

“she makes me feel different” THATS GAY SYD THATS GAYYYY🥺💗
I&#39;ve just finished 2nd episode and I like the vibe... It&#39;s just like The end of the f***ing World &lt;3

so it IS carrey...

Is she a lebanon or something?

Netflix u r motherfucking clever ! I am in , right now .

I- I just finished the show and.... 👏👍

Season one of this is basically like episode  1 of life is strange 2

do not blog or have diary ....keep your  it all in yoour head...OR down deep u want others to know..SSSSSSShhhhhhhh..

WHERE’S THE SUPERPOWERS?! When’s that aspect ever going to come into play?! All I’m seeing is just some typical, angsty, emo-ridden nonsense! And this is supposed to be based off a comic?! Jeez Netflix... You could’ve done better!

I just finished watching season 1 and omg I did not expect that from my innocent Sophia 😳

its end of the fuking world again? come on man, we need season 3

its sneak peek not sneak peak

Within 3 minutes you already know Netflix&#39;s agenda by making 2 teenage girls gay. Ugh

Life is Strange &amp; Carrie vibes.
Isn’t it supposed to be “sneak peek”, not “sneak peak”? Unless there’s a hidden mountain top creeping up on her that I missed.

u don&#39;t even need to know that it&#39;s from their producers &amp; director , it literally looks like a Stranger Things &amp; The end of the FW hybrid.

I got up early to watch the whole season 1 and IT’S AMAZING ! Definitely watch 👌 10/10

Who remember Beverly?

Ha. Alex Mack

PLEASE make a second season

ughhhh I am in love with this show alreadyI can’t wait to stream it rEeEEEE

I think I&#39;m gonna love this

carrie 2020
Finished the whole season. That cliff hanger though. Season 2 now.

Watched this all in one night so worth it

I AM SO READY FOR SEASON 2 LETS GOOO

I am really traumatized by the end, I will not sleep ... However I really liked the series

is this IT spin off when Bev growing up?

This sucks!!@@!!! i just not okay with this.. :-(

Cool... I want season 2 😢

Thanks Netflix coz I&#39;m not paying for 7 mins anymore&lt;3

I CAN HEAR INTO BLACK IN THE BACKGROUND AND IM ALREADY IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW

The style, song, narration, everything screams TEOTFW

You need to renew N O W

My ex’s ex just kicked me out of his  Netflix account... I really wanted to watch this show too💀

Ay listen to me you ALLLLLL she&#39;s mine OK so keep your bad breath ugly looking mouth away from my girlllllYou here that....................good

What the heck did I just see?!

Why did they change the cast of TEOFW😢😢

fantastic
Yupp im watching!
It ended just when things got interesting...is there a second season coming anytime soon? This was such a short first season. The trailer pretty much revealed every plot point.

Is no one gonna talk about how similar this is to Life Is Strange?

gay teenage carrie AM HOOKED

Even i was the dork high school kid with zero friendz..Kinda relate of

<a href="">6:36</a> Is this just normal nose bleed or does Sydney do this?

I think the whole IT cast should join the dceu,especially Sophia lyllis and Wyatt Oleff.🤗

I already finished it... very intense xd
This is after pennywise.

Hell yeah I&#39;m bored 🥴

Want to watch it but it seems scary 😭😭

I&#39;m 17 year old white girl,Oh thanks, i thought you were black.

I couldn’t get past 2 minutes and 30 seconds, because it started making me fall asleep

Missed chance not using mcr’s im not okay at any point

Amazing♥
I think they have a spelling error in the video title... they used &quot;Peak&quot; as in &quot;Mountain peak&quot; instead of &quot;Peek&quot; like &quot;Peek-a-boo&quot; as in seeing.

I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIIIIIIIIIIISSSS

ooh so she is from it👀

is this spin off of I.T, the blood😂😂

am watching episode 1, paused for being in awewell done script as always with NFO, very well chosen and placed music and sounds, very decent acting of the main characters by the way professionals at work

IT PART 2

cant wait to wtch this

Already watched the whole season. it’s sooooooo good!

Somebody can tell me who or what is this &quot;Carrie&quot; that everyone is talking about

Subtle but typical: Lesbian haircut, possible Tran look to main character. The controversial F bomb that Netflix thinks gives their shows an “edgy style,  ewww!” Again no levity, misery, murder as dark humor. Pushing the leftist agenda and proclaiming originality yet it’s the same crap from their previous shows. This is no surprise with these Liberal LGBT execs we see in Netflix interviews pressing this crap in our kids faces. It’s not even interesting: cynical, sarcastic, mean-spirited, and just plain boring.

Carrie is not Okay with This, but high school life is a stranger thing.

GEEEZZZ I NEVER BEEN SOO EXCITEEED TO SEEE THISSSS. AND YET DEADLINES OF PROJECTS ARE COMINGGYIPEE

my friend is such a bAdass

I have Netflix and was gonna watch this anyway. 3 mins into the trailer and yeah I&#39;m deffo gonna start watching this today.

Why is this girl always covered in blood...

I am really excited to watch thusssa😍😍😍😍😍

More degenerative nonsense.

Did stanley commit suicide here too? Over 7 minute clip and not one single scene of him.

i thought netflix was saying they weren’t okay with this sneak peek lol

Gotta say, that joke in the class was actually pretty good. That was a solid insertion. Fit right into it, perfect response to the teacher

I binched the whole season  and it&#39;s so good I would really recommend it to teens

Why the episodes of this series are so small ??

I already saw the whole season lmao 😂

I'm going to continue this series!
She look like the sister of Scarlett Johnson

It was good, very very much like Carrie so the ending was easy to predict, like the writer didn&#39;t even try to cover it up. But overall it was a good experience.
