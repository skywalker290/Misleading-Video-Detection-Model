Story of veer ahirs

it was a good series but personal life  ko zada importance dia gaya

114 The hero sacrificed his life
after wtching this series i feel it has been big direspect to our soldiers rather than showing bravery he showed personal life

Yesterday regiment ❤
Battle of Rezang la….. post this battle Chinese nvr came back to claim this land ever in spite of having soldiers superiority. That was the valour shown by ahir caste from Rewari Haryana that Chinese nvr moved ahead fearing onslaught ahead wherein one company killed 3000 Chinese soldiers.

Ahir🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Yrrr kya series baniye hai ashgi jada dekhi gayi kuch ta toofani banate boring series of the year

These false propaganda movies are really outrageous. At that time, China had just experienced a great famine, and Chinese soldiers crossed the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to fight with the Indians. It is unbelievable that a handful of hungry and weak Chinese soldiers defeated a large number of Indian troops like ducks, and maintained a peaceful mind to release the prisoners and did not invade Indian territory. My evaluation of this war is that the Indian army turned a war of aggression into a war of defense, greedy and incompetent. My evaluation of this kind of movie is that the Indian government uses imagined bravery to cover up its own misery. My suggestion is that the government should provide more protection to the poor instead of replacing it with spiritual placebos.
India should not carry on British legacy.

The last regiment is ours
Ahir regment jay yadav jay madhav

Hm you are demanding no regiment, the government is the regiment's boss then look at me veer YADAV..
After all the regiment is ours
I love this type of web series...jai hind 💪

On 18 November 1962, 124 soldiers of 13 Kumaon Regiment were deployed in Rejangla Chushul. This regiment is also called Veer Ahir because the soldiers in it are Yadavs. 124 Indian soldiers defeated 2000 Chinese soldiers. They fought very bravely and did not allow the enemies to move forward. a>
That's why this regiment is needed, Bhosdiko made all the films but Jin Yadav did not even mention his name in the sacrifice.
Where did my sister's children take Yadav's name?
The last victory is now that India is not the last. 120 The last has nailed the chin that has forced an end to the war. The last word has been heard in the chin, this is what is happening behind the chin, the chin has been bred by the Japanese but Rahe Ahir, he has saved these people, he is doing this even after doing his best, he has taken his life in the jungle.
Ahiron is sacrificed in this war

Army sacrificed its lives and Congress sold China's weapons to the country.
Amazing
Chang and Pawandeep ex Indian Idols

Without Jaswant singh and a brave girl from Arunachal Pradesh there is no story of Indo-chinese war 1962... Please make a special movie on them..  Then Arunachal Pradesh was known as NEFA.. Most of army officers were out of post to  avoid death but Rifleman Jaswant singh didn&#39;t do that, he fought and fought for three days alone along with his loved Sela the brave daughter of India..

Who is here after watching Pawndeep rajan short video ❤️❤️

This web series should be in theatre

Salute to our ancestors, who gave us that freedom and a moment to feel proud... My father is also in army and a participant of KARGIL WAR 1999  From~ Rao kapil Kant Singh Yadav

Jai Yadukul🚩
My Grandfather Shri RamSwaroop singh Yadav fought in that war in infantary department

Will remember the support of 120 friends🙏🙏Jai Dada Kishan🙏
The battle of Rezang la is one of the bravest battle in the history of indian army where 120 ill equiped  solders of Charlie company of kumaun Regiment who were told to retreat from their post due to heavy influx of better equipped Chinese solders but they refused to retreat and fought till the last bullet last menAnd braving such odds  killed nearly 1500 better equipped solders of Chinese army who not only were better equipped but had the support of artillery (which killed most of our solders)It was due to this heavy loss the chinese declared ceasefire otherwise they had significant gains in NEFAThe solders fought with such bravery that even the superior officers were not believing it and it was when they shaw the battlefield after the winters that they could see the evidence of bravery themselvesBollywood should make a big budget movie on this battle so that comman  people of inda also know about the braveryThe Rezangla war memorial is on the bike trail of leh Ladakh but very few Indians know the bravery of our soldersTheir bravery need to be told to the nation

Sorry to say .... Special effects are so poor ...

Hundreds of salutes to Paramveer Major Shaitan Singh Ji Bhati (Jodhpur Rajasthan) whose character is played by Bobby Deol in the name of Major Suraj Singh.
No mention of Major Shaitan Singh

There were 120 Yadav soldiers and Jat regiment under the leadership of Thakur Shaitan Singh Major ji of Rajasthan and then they defeated 3000 soldiers in that mind-numbing cold. Jai Hind.
My grandfather was in 1975 war

Abbey is the bestest actor

Bs trailer hi shi hai dekhne me🤣😅😅
why over 1, 100 dislikes? it looks like a good film to me.

So, nehru really cared about ladakh?as you portrayed

Legends🔥🔥❤️
Where is Jaswant Singh Rawat?? In whole series??? The main hero ko 1962 who killed 300 Chinese soldiers at that own

Finally, some decided to show China real face.

Chutiya Nehru didn&#39;t understood importance of army before 1962

major shaitan singh was leading c company of kumauni regiment

Bollywood will give the Indian army a great honor.

Now again India will eat the fat of China, hey boy!
Instead of showing bravery in a movie, show it in reality.

Salute

Instead of surrendering, the enemy dared to fight back at me.

It is very nice series. War scenes in the last are done well. Slow in the middle though. For soldier&#39;s family every incidence is different than common lives like us, that is well captured in the series. At one stage I felt who is going to live longer a Major or his wife with cancer. For him a war is at both ends. Every Indian should watch this series.

Nice

Real gossebumps starts from <a href="">1:37</a>

Just finished watching the series it&#39;s amazing.. we need more patriotic series 🇮🇳

ExcellentBut this series is defending Nehru a lot That bastard is reason why we faced so many problems especially our soldiers

Don&#39;t know why the hell do they hide the real names of our brave warriors. The post in actual was of Rezang La and the officer in command was Param Vir Chakra awardee Major Shaitan Singh ..... Salute to our real heroes 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

This show Neheru in good light, but in reality it was his fault that India lost this big chunk of land.

If this movie was in 3D then it was so .....

wow i watched all episodes i love this and the songs are super awesome please keep your talent up in this type of series thank you

Jai dada kishan
I read about this movie in Chinese social media bc it became a mockery there . Losing a war is one thing, losing so badly is another, let alone it was a massacre for Indian soldiers. And Indian ppl, OK bollywood, has audacity to claim winner. The war was so lopsided - 3 Chinese soldiers captured a whole Indian battalion without firing a shot. 😂 😂

Bhai jisne nhi dekhi use bhi yeh dekhni chahiye war + love story and india vs china war kuch ankahi kahani kuch hero&#39;s ki jo acting thi wo kamal ki thi movie ke andar mujhe sabse jyada acha wo teen soldiers jo any tk ldeKishan, ramkumar, KaranFirst time mujhe lga ki jo itna hasha skta hain wo itne serious roll bhi kr skta hain Awesome I love this web series mene iske liye hi hotstar ka vip recharge krwaya mujhe to bahut achi lagi  ha kuch khamiya hain bt dushri web series se or abhi jo bollywood ki halat hain usse to yeh khi behtar hain

Indian live in their dreams😂

I am respect Bollywood Army 🤔😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Appreciate Hotstar for bringing these types of series...based on real patriotism of our Heroes

Very good series must see for every Indian. We don&#39;t really have much idea about 1962 war. Thanks to our History test books we know so many things about world war, Alexander the fool and so many others...but so little about our real fighters. Kudos to Pawandeep Rajan(Indian Idol 2021 contestant) 😀...chota sa role tha but bada acha laga dekhke.

Fast forward to 2020China again tried to inflatrate Indian border ended up losing a strategic hilltop location and six border posts along LAC and accepted stalemate and casualties from their side after six months

Bas film banana

Wathar station is shown as Rewari Jn - director forgot to cover the station name :P

Watched amazing

Waiting  Watched ❤🇮🇳❤
This series depicts 1962  war in the worst possible way....the makers should take lessons from the creators of the movie 1971 which is available on YouTube. This series is just like the movie paltan based on the 1967 nakula conflict the only similarity being both are really bad .Disappointed

Who tf dislikes productions like these &amp; goes on to give thousands of likes to Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai &amp; Saath Nibhana Saathiya!

Who gets goosebumps while watching

Rejang La war, salute to veer Ahir , hope this movie would do justice to them not giving their name to others.

Goose balms have arrived
The two enemies of India's soldiers were China and Nehru.
Good to see aakash thosar in this web series

Sorry but the acting is very bad

Worst acting and cinematography in any webseries ever

Y chaina whi h na jiss n 1962 m Tibet aor ab 20 soldiers mary ao Indian zamin m betha h Indian army only on Bollywood

Horrible direction and production.  The 1st episode itself shows the lack of quality in the series. The village is shown as Rewari and it clearly feels like a village in konkan. Mr. Manjrekar, you think the viewers are morons to not  understand that you have put a whole marathi cast to depict haryanvis. What a waste.

Yadav brothers should understand that by pointing yadav or ahirs they r cutting the size of their sacrifice ...each Soldier of rezang la is Son of India ...maati ka laal 🇮🇳 don&#39;t cut them itno Yadav&#39;s jaats rajput they r our best  soldiers

Hotstar make web series on rajiv Dixit

People fighting on Ahir Yadav etc ...yakeen kro vo us din jo rahe the vo hindus ki liye rahe hai vo hindustani ki fauj ladit pr bhar dar bhi hindustani ki fauz rahi hai regiment koi bhi ho sainik se pucho usko samman chaiye se desh. ...I have paid tribute to 124 soldiers.

Kesari movie was touted as the most patriotic fight but it had nothing to do with Indian army. Just a glorification of a particular religion. Got famous coz of the song and Akshay&#39;s Deshbhakti. But movies like 1971 &amp; 1962  go unnoticed. That&#39;s the artistic attack Bollywood does.  Ours fault too that we don&#39;t acknowledge the real contents. Glad I didn&#39;t watch that.   Ready to binge watch 1962. Hope it does represent the fact without changing their names. We all proud of the Rezang La, Shaitan Singh and the brave Ahirs of Kumaon Regiment. 🙏🏼 Jai Hind 🇮🇳

Paramvir Chakra Sri Major Shaitaan Singh and his men. The Bravehearts of Rezang La

How can mr.nehru afford a war with china by sending just 125 soldiers..125 vs 3000 this is ridiculous. India badly missed the services of netaji.

Akash thosar

Dil kush ho gya trailer dekh k
Awesome

Sairat's hero ❤❤❤
Real life hero... . Indian 🇮🇳Army. 💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏
This story need to be told....

Is it based on Battle of Rezang La ? The story of 13 Kumaon?

Nehru, did you go on vacation in the 1962 war?
Love indian army ❤️❤️❤️
I hope they clearly show the stupidity of Nehru in this series. !

What kind of taste have you kept brother??? The way we all are living together in Haryanavi-Yadav-jaat, we will always see if we were alive, even today we would have been killed again after seeing the boy in Jaatiyo….that bhartiya the…bas… I am very saddened by the comments.
It made me laugh so hard, has anyone seen it?
Great salute to these Indian great lions

Proud to be ahir

My father survied this war i love you papa

Outstanding movie 🤔🤔🤔

The guy who is acting as Chinese General is the same guy from Badmash Company?

China Mai Bhi 🇮🇳 Lehrayega
bollywood Infiltrate history with their fake content..😡😡😡

We were brutaly beaten by chinese in 1962, we were not prepared as hindi chini bhai bhai nautanki by nehru, we used 1914 ww1 rifles bcoz menon said no need of army, we were not helped by russian despite of fact that nehru was russian agent by policy, we lost 38000 sq km. I think if instead of nehru if patel would have been there definitely result of war might be in favor of us.

I got goosebumps watching this 🔥❤️

Nehru and K K Menon did such a thing in China.
Wow

Indian army ki jai ho, and isme jitne bhi actor h sab ki acting mst h or koi bhi over acting nhi krtaa h mst hogyi ye

Sometimes I feel.pakistan is just an conspiracy tool we think wants kashmir.real greed is china for kashmir

🇮🇳 YESTERDAY REGIMENT🇮🇳
One of the most underrated actor Abhay Deol ❤️

India won war all movies in our fantasy🤔

I hoped it would be near reality but felt like watching hype of war drama. Feeling bad. High pitch dialogues. Nothing feels real in it. Sorry if someone is hurt

Jai hind
This is why Army should take charge of the nation..Both the leading parties have bitten my country to pieces....Iam a proud Grandson of a Subedaar Major who was part of the Indo china war

CLICHE SHIT.......TYPICAL BOLLYWOOD....

Thanks hotstar. You are doing a Samaritan&#39;s job by fuelling  nationalism in &#39;half baked&#39; Indian audiences. Atleast we&#39; ll acknowledge- what true bravery is! I am totally fed up with &#39;masala 🍿movies&#39; of bollywood.

Goosebumps

Abhay Deol&#39;s character is based on Major Shaitan Singh Bhati of Kumaon Regiment

Who is this person who dislikes Bhadwa?

India lost in  1962 haha
Just look at the number of dislikes... this clearly shows the number of traitors and Green Seculars in our country... 🇵🇰🐷🐒🇵🇰

The country should know how because of a failed Prime Minister we had to lose India's land. How because of a failed politician we had to sacrifice our soldiers. How a war which could have been stopped only through talks was stopped because of a foolish politician. It was imposed on the country.

Goosebumps 🔥
Paramvir chakra major Shaitan singh (Rajput) and 124 Yadav Soldiers. Salute to them.

win in movie. lose on real life. lol

Why are you making your people crazy by showing fake stories because the world has seen the truth, how the Chinese army kicked you out of Ladakh.
ahir rejimet
Major Shaitan Singh indeed became the devil who&#39;d haunt the Chinese soldiers on the battlefield, but in the end he was escorted to heaven by angels.

So you are telling me, Dev and Paro are reuniting in this ?!

India alwas win only movies not real life😃😃😃

VFX could have been better.

Abhay Deol underrated actor, I&#39;m glad he is getting quality content movies.

This is a web series of Congress's failure. eye opener
Adi maxt tis hiju kana
Amazing
Chinni should not be fake
Where is the final destination?
Trailer is truly awesome ..loved it .

Abhay deol is best actor ❤️

Those who dislike will definitely be traitors...
Abhay deol is easily one of the finest n most underrated actor of this generation.

Soldiers Ka koi jati aur Dharm  nhi hota .....O Bharat Ma ke Veer Saput hote hai........We should pray for them

Indian idol singers are better actors 😂😂

Those who sacrificed their lives for the country are free from the brahmin caste, pls grow up as people, those who sacrificed for the country are not for any caste <a href="">#Salute</a>

I wonder how Akshay kumar is not a part in this movie. This was history when India fought against China. Now, China has already conquered our places and all this government cares about is handing over all the money to his friends and about the upcoming bengal elections.

Excellent. There was a great need to make a film on this true heroic tale.

you shitty Bollywood people still playing with our feelings you people totally change his name....the bravest solider of the battle of Razangla was MAJ.

I remember my grandfather also part of this war and when tell the story for all the incidents he crying and proud to say that i am Indian ...I also proud that he is my grandfather

Yesterday regiment 🔥🔥🦁🦁
You have to watch ads even after paying ₹399 🤷🏻‍♂️
This actor shouldn&#39;t  be there, manoj bajpai etc are better

Ab to AHIR Regement leke rahenge 🙏

I am a big war movie fan and there has been a dearth of good war movies or shows based on our rich Indian history. Nice that the OTT platforms are coming forward and investing and giving us shows like this and The Forgotten Army which came out last year. This definitely looks interesting and I am so looking forward to watching it. The sound track also seems to sound quite good. Only complaint would be that at times the CGI effects looks a bit odd.

Thanks a ton to our army who saved our Maa Bharati

Our luck was so bad in 1962, this bastard Gandu was our PM.
Bollywood hai toh theek hai warna 1962 lots of north easter and Tibetans fought too.!! Who are more adaptable to the himalayan climates.🙏.

Nehru saying &quot;Damn!&quot; 😅😅😅

Did this series include famous quote of Chacha ji in Parliament <b>&quot;Not even a blade of grass grows&quot;</b>

This trailer is giving me goosebumps

Akash dada❤️
Abhay deols dialog delivery is very poor n lacks the required passion

Abhay Deol seems to be really miscastes

I have no knowledge of this Indian society...meaning in my imaginations...or there is nothing in real..
Love this trailer ❤

Akash thosar

Finally! I&#39;m seeing Abhay Deol in a movie after a long time. He really needs to do more and more. All that talent is wasting and we aren&#39;t watching his awesome acting. Instead we all have to bear Varun Dhawan, Ranveer Singh kinda actors.

120 ahir vs 6000 Chinese soldiers

Based on indo sino war

Please rate this kind of movies 5 out of 5 they r outsiders not stupid nepo kids good for nothing.

I thinks trailer looks ordinary like other shows initially but the title track, it&#39;s the fourth moon of the show. I loved it. Looking forward and best wishes for one my favourite all time Abhay Deol. ❤️

India could have won this war easily but Jawaharlal Nehru involved the country in his politics and did not allow the country's Air Force to take part in it and during his rule, Tibet and PoK lost 148000 square kilometers of land. .
Rejangla Ahir warriors

Loving the casts ❤️

yadav

India lost to China in 1962 but fight at 3 locations should be considered victory for India.Subedar Joginder Singh (20 vs 600)Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat (1 vs 300)Major Shaitan Singh (125 vs 3000)

D day game graphics are much better than this dirty film

casting is bad

Too much animated explosions. No offense but the vfx looks kind of cheaper quality. Would have loved it more had they used good vfx or live action demo explosions.

Wow

Parshya❤️
Abhay Deol saying 'Ladakh has gone by the hand and will not return' sounds like dolly shopping gayi toh go back nahi aayegi

Battle Of Rejangla.....When 125 Indian Lions Fought Against 3000+ Chinese Wolves.

Awesome trailer ❤️❤️❤️
Jawaharlal nehru: We cannot afford a war with china...Fact: Both India and china were at the same place in terms of economy in 1962. And militarily, India, was a bit better than china cuz we had Air force. It was Nehru&#39;s weak policy that made us lose 1962 war.Today, when china&#39;s military is really powerful and economically, china is so much strong (that it defeated 2 countries (Australia and US) in trade war and also successfully survived economic sanctions from India and UK), then also, we defeated them in Galwan (2021) and Doklam (2017). Thus a powerful military is not the only thing we want. We also want a powerful leader, who can control a powerful military.Salute to our brave heroes amd martyrs.P.S.: Please make a series on 1971 war too... I would like to see that how world&#39;s largest ever surrender took place.

My maternal grandfather faught this war &amp; survived it. The only <b>Line that holded</b> itself was the <b>Chushul sector</b> of <b>Rezang La</b> where <b>123 AHIRS from plains of 13th Kumaon</b> took the last stand &amp; faught the last man last round battle, which is greatest battle faught till now in the history of Indian Army. To this day <b>Yadavas</b> do not have their Regiment in the Army despite having a <b>Valiant history</b> .... This  is no more than a 2nd class movie...nothing here has any significance in reality. Read the Diary Entry of <b>General KS Thimmaiya</b> if you want to learn the real thing.

This is the story of those who killed the Chinese in Rezangal. Jai Yadav Jai Madhav Jai Hindustan
In this, the soil of Ahirwal should also have been mentioned from where those 125 warriors came. Many people will be surprised to know that all those heroes were from the same area and belonged to the same caste. Some were real brothers. Some Ahirwati language should also have been included which would have brought truth to the drama adaptation. That dialogue should also have been included in which a soldier is saying &quot; We do not leave the ridge of the field easily, it is the border of the country &quot; , I think it would have been better if they had just made the conversion and not added anything extra. Ahir regiment is right 🚩
Ahir regiment is our right
Energetic 🔥🔥🔥
Is that persha🤔

Jai Dada Kishan
Amazing movie

👍 hotstar for making patriotic series like this

Bizzare screenplay with over the top acting and dialogues. Meiyang chang Indian idol singer as Chinese general come on bullywood. Lol 😂🤣. Childish treatment to a great story 😂🤣😂

Rejangla see AHIR
Big salute to our martyars but graphics of this movie is seen  very down to the market , uri movies VFX was really good

Gu

After watching this film it became clear how Nehru instigated the war to kill our soldiers.
Wow

Abhay deol so underrated Marvellous acting skills

This war inevitably led to the death of our former PM Nehru. He never expected such betrayal from the Chinese.

Abhay deol  makes it so real

Salute to our great brave Soldiers they are real hero &amp; everyone&#39;s knows the real culprit for the victory if chienes in 1962war the worst politician&#39;s of that time

Another Bollywood dreamers drama bazi, now you have become the first person lol
Abhay Deol is a good actor but playing the role of a soldier will not pay much because he is aggressive.
China, Nepal, brother, brother, not India.
If Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had been the Prime Minister, we could have won this war also.
Sorry lekin sirf movies ki had tak .........

Soldier's caste does not happen..

Shame on Hotstar for changing History , They are showing soldiers from all India for using all India&#39;s emotions for Money  but they always will be Brevest of the brave VEER AHIR

Dev and Paro

Noone can beat Abhay Deol he is on top 👍Good Luck Bhai!!!!!!!!

In real India lost their territory  but  in movies  it will  be totally opposite .   Lol. Hahah

It&#39;s nice to see a good actor like Abhay Deol is portraying Major Shaitan Singh Bhatti, PVC and awaiting for this series. I am sensing a error here. In this trailer our soldiers are firing through Kalashnikov, Heavy Machine Guns and Automatics but in reality our forces had old vintage .303 and Bren guns thanks to the ignorant defense modernization policy of our esteemed first Prime Minister and ex-communist Defense Minister who likes his pliant generals and clashes with worthy generals like Thinayya, Thorat and Manekshaw.Battle of Rezangla is the gloriest chapter in our war history. Whenever I read or here anything about this Battle, I always feels goosebumps; my eyes start tearing for our bravest 125 fighters of 13th Kumaon. I hope bollywood didn&#39;t messed with history this time.&quot;How a man can dies better against fearful odds, for ashes of his father and temples of his god.&quot;

Not against the sentiments. Just a little disappointed at the production.But Ak-47 in 1962 ? Our Soldiers had only 303 Enfield Rifles at that time. Only officers used carbines. Had that indian battalion had Automatic Guns to use, they would had wiped out the entire Chinese regiment.

Jai Hind! Jai Bharat Mata!

Ahir Regiment Hak he Hamara....

The one who has been watching the film is not a brave person.
I am Chinese and I love India movies. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think this is a good movie even though I haven&#39;t watched it completely yet.Of course, don&#39;t be so quick to blame me.I never mean this blacken China or something.What I want to say is just that IT OVERSTATES PLA.In 1962, China was a very poor and underdeveloped country and there are lots of people who can&#39;t get enough food.And you know, Chinese belongs to the yellow race while Indian belongs to the Caucasian race. Everyone knows Caucasian is stronger than yellow in build.Thirdly, PLA mainly consists of peasant and other poor people and its officer is the same.Do you admit the three points above?So how can you explain that the Chinese soldiers are so muscular that they almost explode their uniform in the movie?And how can you explain that the Chinese commander behaves like a rich man, wearing sunglasses and clasping hands behind his back?In 1962, if you behaved like a rich man, you will have been arrested and your property will be confiscated in China. Finally, that&#39;s very funny that I found the director regard Chinese soldier as USA soldier.Remember, Chinese soldiers too poor to be muscular like that, they never salute like a western soldier and play handsome(wearing sunglasses) in 1962.Only USA soldier do this.That&#39;s all I can&#39;t suffer as a normal Chinese. Some people always ignore the poverty of China.

Come on, where in the world this Indian is killing someone so that he can make a movie… he is happy to suck his own hair without any reason.
Although we are proud of our indian soldiers but meiyang chang is also an indian and his acting is great in this

There were 114 brave Ahirs in the Rejangla war. They were not shown. The director, producer and writer should be ashamed. They should drown and die.
Worst VFX ever.....

Apart from 125 soldiers, where were the rest of the soldiers, and China was dirt even earlier and is still there today, China is the mother of China.
114 Yadav soldiers sacrificed their lives in this war, we pay our respects to them for the country.

Ayeeehayeee yeee hota hai war.......

the trailer doesn&#39;t mention a single space of yadav veer ..and who says all yadav where from harayana basically they where not only  from haryana but  also from UP MP Bihar Rajasthan..from UP i know the relatives

Goosebumps.... Jai Hind..

We all Marathi people feel proud because Marathi actor Akash in this movie Jai Hind Jay Maharashtra 🇮🇳🚩
I was going to search motivational video , but what a motivation i found 🔥🔥🔥

'SIKH REGIMENT' Who is the Sikh who has contributed more than everyone else?
JAI HIND🇮🇳🇮🇳
All the patriots are very blessed now that we have given our land to China. See, if you have changed then it is possible.
Congress and neheru fault.

Good movie my Choice film
Nehru PM nehi hota toh India won the war of 1962
Such a shame on you hotstar... Betisodo who have given birth to the song because their name is not there.. 125 people have martyred this shameless ... Diwali is our day.. Lata Mangeshkar has written the song &quot; logo of the country&quot; I have never sung this song.. Doob maro kahan se laate ho tona blindapan.. <a href="">#shame_on_hotstar</a>
For our soldiers respect and we  proud of them jai hind

Jai Hind 🇮🇳🙏
Abhay Deol is underrated.. for me he&#39;s better actor than Sunny &amp; Bobby.

<a href="">

Love u Yadav Brothers!

Ohhh bhaii maza aa gya...i saw special cops that was outstanding nd now this...salute u guys

Bakwaas
Good to see Abhay Deol again love his acting 😊

Jai ho veer ki
nehru ji already knew about Chinese intention. Chinese President already mentioned around 6 months in advance in India visit. he gave 2 options to nehru ji, settle ladakh with Arunachal Pradesh or War.nehru ji wanted to settle ladakh against Arunachal Pradesh, but His cabinet and others rejected the proposal.in that case, nehru ji knew about Chinese mindset, but didn&#39;t take any proactive remedy or action.From the beginning, Congress is a dove in front of Chinese Communist Party

wow....

Lots of luck to the series,it&#39;s very hurting to serve for people who thinks sacrificing is a part of job,no it&#39;s not .Salute to all those who are working for country&#39; pride and protection.

&quot;jai hind&quot;....
Immediately
Will definitely watch it for Abhay Deol.

Wow...Awesome trailer it is...Salute to Indian army...Jay Hind...Jay Bharat...Bharat mata ki jay...❤️🙏❤️
My grandfather was in army in 1962 he have told me so many stories about war and how his friends died

Iiiiiiiiii want to say why are these soldiers so devoted to the country!!! Why should we become such a big brother in India among the civilized people? Everyone's ass is ruined for speaking like Mother India. You are the mother of all people.
125 Indian soldiers ok!!But who counted that there were 3000 Chinese soldiers?? They all look same, i think double, triple counting mistake!

I hope the producers behind this don&#39;t make some propoganda movie or show after making 💰 from this show on our brave Indian soldiers.

In 125 soldiers there were 114 yadavs . Ahirs are from ahirwal haryana . Finally ..🙏🙏

Bad graphics

Hail India
Everyone is talking about movie but no one is talking about meiyang Chan he is so talented actor 🥺he does a great work

Ahir regiment

Story of Brave PVC Shaitan Singh...

I read the brave before watching the trailer

Please VFX good kro

There should be a special web series on Shaitan Singh 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Jay Yadav Jay Madhav

Abhay Deol content based movie ka master actor with great acting skills 👍👍👍👍
Ahirwal

No offense but looking fake animation what else we can expect from bollywood 👎

I Love It

Hotstar originals alag level ka content milta hi

Jai hind jai bharat

Jai Hind🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
In this movie marathi actor akash thosar (parshya in sairat movie) is also there

where the heck is bhuj and big bull

The habit of Bollywood is to copy a lot of things.
Show it like this, change the name and give 125 last soldiers or today Veer last place is in Rezangal. I love Indian Army.
Jai Hind

<a href="">1:01</a> is that Parshya ? From SAIRAT ? if yes then nice to see him evolving.

Who seen parshya like

I will film two h.🇮🇳
Proud to be yaduvanshi Ahir 🙏 Ahir Regiment Haq hai hamara

Aree itne automatic weapon the kya hamare pass ?Anyone noticed purana SLR rifle?Or nehru ne Kaha damm 🤦🏻

Our great Nehru ji did not speak Hindi but sat in the wheel of Bhai Bhai. Unhone order giving true hi nhi samjha
Chodi Chaat Veer's real caste is that of the farmer's father.
Jai Hind, I have a request to those people who do not know much about the war of 1962, do Google, it shows how brave our youth were, how motivational, emotional this war was.
What does a young man sacrifice for his country? Jai Jawan Jai Hind ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fire 🔥🔥
😂😂😂 My god,,,!!! India wins, only in Cinemas,..

How can a man die better,Than facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And temples of his gods.To the sacred memory ofthe heroes of Rezang-La114 martyrs of 13 Kumaonwho foughtto the last man last roundagainst hordes of Chineseon18 November 1962.Built by all ranks 13th Battalion the Kumaon Regimen

Battle of rezang la

movie name should be .. battle of rezang la... fought by KUMAON Regiment

Jay Veer Yadav

Happy to see akash thosar in web series

True story of rezang la

Charlie company
Apart from bravery of our soldiers, failure of Jawaharlal Nehru&#39;s govt should also been showed, which resulted in China illegally occupying laddakh. Our soldiers fought bravely and were ready to take on China.

AKASH THOSAR (PARSHYA) FAN LIKE👍👍
Soldier is the life or glory of the country 🇮🇳🚩 Jai Hind
Jay Yadav Jay madhav

My Dad s cousin never came back in this battle... They never found his body.. Some says He was kidnapped by Chinese, and they never released him or killed him. Many soldiers have untold stories.

Imagine shubash chandra bose instead of pandit Ji because gandhi and playboy never wanted an army If shubhash bose was there india would be a super power nowFather of the nation : netaji bose

There was much more than just shit and. Cry of nehru gandhis....Dont wash their sins with soldiers blood.It was complete idiotic behaviour from a govt. To its soldiers...from weapons to war policies.

Amazing
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Indian soldier took 1 like 👍👍👍🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Disney+ Hotstar keep bringing such content
Abhay Deol .. mind blowing performance 👍

Again this genre is going boom in the market and always its works like that, I pray

I hope they bring 1967 war also👍

125 all soldiers are AHIR ❣️🇮🇳 JAI HIND
Stay in the company of good people. Goldsmith's &quot; Garbage&quot; Also, become that &quot; Almond &quot; It is costlier than..
In this movie, there is no support for all Ahiro or there is no name for it, only Ahiro's caste is based on the caste feeling, then there is the name of any community or there is no name in the movie because of the Ahiro's pride.
Netflix/Prime/Voot thing in Hotstar.. People won&#39;t watch that much here in Hotstar I guess..

Trailer looks amazing
nice  video

I think they should make a movie on FORGOTTEN WAR b/w India and China in Sikkim

Jai hind
Jai hind 🇮🇳
The Indian Army was the same earlier and is the same even today. But the difference is visible in leadership. Today China had to step back.

Rezangal Yuddh = Ahir's battle ":"Veer Ahir Sher Ahir. <a href="">#wewantahirregiment</a>
Bhai Saab, in the 1962 war, the Gorkha regiment of Nepal 🇳🇵 also showed bravery. Many Gorkha martyrs also happened but their name is not mentioned anywhere. This is very unfair
I can proud of myself .... jai hind 🇮🇳

Salute to Indian Army 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
1962 war hamare ministers Ka failure tha...only love China and still they love China. Koi unko wapas Italy bhejo that time agar army ki suntey to aksai cheen nhi hota

Our real heroes jai Hind, jai Army
The trailer is so dark that i had to lower my brightness after being on trending section

We want ahir regiment

Can&#39;t wait for this webseries. Jai Hind🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

114 Ahirs have given martyrdom in Rejangla 1962 war but I have heard that there is no mention of the sacrifice of brave Ahirs in this web series, if it is so then it will also be a deception for the Ahir community.
uttrakhandis contribution has always been overlooked, I hope this is just a begining.

I got goosebumps 🙏🙏🙏
Rejangla war, one of the 8 destructive historical wars till now, was fought between India and China on 18 November 1962, in which 114 brave Ahirs (Yadavs) sacrificed everything and saved more than 1300 Chinese soldiers while securing the Ladakh region of the country. Killed. Last Bullet, Last Men 🎯
Sb Bc Ho Jo Hamare glorious history bta rhe hai Unhe Chodir sale jane kya dekh rhe hai This trailer become 1st trending
🇮🇳Jai Hind
There is lot of diffrance btw nehru and modi.. Thats why ladakh is no more in indian map

Bharath Mathaki Jai 🔥🔥
Dislike bale gaddar hai

Jai Yadav Jai Madhav
see yesterday
Proud of indian army and Proud of Yadav   ❤🇮🇳💪

jay hind
but this feels more like a propaganda series than a historical war drama series because we lost pretty badly as much as i remember in 1962 and the chinese unilaterally declared ceasefire after conquering aksai chin ,   pls correct me if i am missing something here!!!

Surely it will Glorify Chacha

Random Fact - Ants never sleep.l

Glad to see it trending.
Nice war scenario...love this and excited to see it

FINALLY SOME THING TO REVEAL THE TRUTH OF CONGRESS LIKE GUTTERS!!!!

Vir Ahir- Jai Hind ❤️🙏🏻
All Commandos are Ahir(Yadav).
Best movie trailer
Best of the best sereas is &quot;The forgotten army&quot;

On that time those bc congress was the reason we lost so much land to pak and china. Mc ne bas khaya. 5th Richest country but still developing.

In comment section why everyone is typing Ahir soldiersWhy not make it simple- 125 indian soldiers

A very wonderful web series has been prepared. If the original names of Major Shaitan Singh and his 120 brave Ahir companions had been included, then why does this happen mostly with Yadavs only?
A request to all my yadav brothers to <a href="">#boycott1962</a> Pahle sarkar ne hamse hamara hakk Cheena ab ye sale do kodi ke producerScript me veer Ahir likhne me shram aa rhi thi.?

Pawandeep rajan ...talented indian idol contestant is going to be  a Chinese   in this series

Indias frist best war series is here

Oh my God what a trailer it was

Good trailer but Chairman Mao not chao😅

I love those individuals who are playing the character of indian soldiers....they are looking very similar to real Army soldire.... especially the lower rank one..with moustache.....❤️

Great Yadav&#39;s 114 soldier fight for our nation by bare hand  VS fulley equip Chinese army

How many people know about new actor &#39;akash thosar&#39; ❤️👍
