I don't know but neither Jason Statham nor Keanu Reeves convince me as martial arts fighters.
I love this combination (*^ω^*)
Amo o jason statham
This is not only a movie

the best F&amp;F

The praises on Dwayne 

Hi 
They were the beest of fast and furious......That&#39;s why Vin loves the Rock.

i would prefer to have jasons fighting technique and quickness over dwaynes big muscles lol

Very hard work

I would watch their real fight!!!
Work work work its even harder when you dont and when you get older

James wan

Both Jason and The Rock play movie role’s as “the good guy and the hero”.But then WHAT IF they found themselves fighting each other for the wrong reason?

I just wana be happier

For me this is the best one on one fight I ever seen in a movie

It&#39;s cool that no shaking camera was used.

Jason Statham. What a lovely guy. I have met him in person and he is so down to earth 

Paul is not dead he is just waiting for us at the finish line

Man James Won is the best.

I was always disappointed that Jason Statham wasn’t cast as The Hitman.

Jesus the rock is loaded to the gills!

Jason Statham be like: You stand in front of Dwayne Johnson and be like &quot;Thank God this is just a movie.&quot;Me too, Jason, me too.

James wan great director
Super star the rock and show

Best movie ever
They make it look so easy!!! Its like their dancing in the behind the scenes fight scenes!!! at <a href="">1:44</a>



Allahu Akbar
THE ROCK ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE JOSAN SATHAM

i love jason statham he is the best he is better than torero than paul walker and thé rock and before all he saved the life of a little girl megalodon congrats jason you should get a reward at least half a million maybe seven hundred million or more i am rooting for you
That since was awesome I saw that movie several times
Pro there&#39;s some parts blocked I can&#39;t see them why??!

Jason Statham ️
This deserves to go down as one of the legendary action scenes from the 2010s

The shoes are sneakers from Deckard
Good movie, I want to see 9
You two are not action movie star but jus a actor. Real action movie star must be a martial art person who do everything without any stund double, wired or computer

Love the rock!!!!

Those who say Jason Vick should watch this video and know that this man is a legend and there is nothing like him.
My favorites R/J

Rock said it was refreshing to bang it out with him... in Jamaica we say that&#39;s yyyyyyyyyyyyy

So the Rock did this whole fight himself ? Nice

Jason

Nice muvie very nice 
THE ROCK is my all time FAV

While the roka is filming her movies, her cousin is being fucked in WWE
Jason

Jason sthatham my favorite actor and great Martel artist in the world

Dwayne may be the most buff guy but Jason always fights with style





Jason: Thank god its a movie Lmao 

Jason fights like a well trained military fella. Like special ops training etc. Plus his fighting choreography is amazingly elegant. Something you would expect from a trained military guy. He fits the profile very well. Rock fights like a wrestler. Pounces like one too. His weakness is his size,  which makes him bulky and slow. But it also is his strength. Fighting is much more about your mental ability and strength than it is about your physical strength. Both have very different body types and fighting styles. That&#39;s what makes their fighting chemistry great.

&quot;It was very refreshing to bang it out with him&quot; - the rock. Never knew the guy was gay...

No doubt The rock is stronger but Jason is more resourceful with the things around him....

<a href="">1:23</a> omg

I can watch jason statham fight my whole life

&#39;thanks god it is a move- standing in-front of this huge guy.... &#39;&#39;

But there is no shortage of Marranos who see those stupid things.
What a mess of movies, some fools up and down making a bad face and they can't hit them and they never beat them
Girls pay for the movie, they're already on their 20th and some idiots can't beat them up and down in some cars making a bad face.
This was the most badass fight I have ever  Jason do

<a href="">

Please visit and get your interest in one page. Thanks.  <a href="">

Rock bottom

I can watch Dwayne&#39;s movies all day I wish I can meet him one day, I know I definetly wanna be like him

Jason Look

This is how powerful movies are made! It seems more difficult to stop him at the last minute than to hit him.

Fast 11 and fast12

PERO  DECKARD SHAW NO DERRAMA SANGRE CON TODA ESA PALIZA

I think this movie has lost what it known beat for and start with a lot of impossible shit that just don’t make it as interesting

How could I get a job on set doing things like this.

James wan from singapore

Jason is my hero!!!Oh my god!!!

Paul walker would never have thought that this will be his last film of fast and furious franchise Which he will complete full

The same guy who made Aquaman.

<a href="">2:32</a> - getting a crazy &quot;Enhancement Drug - SNL&quot;-vibe here =,D

Dwayne IS a damn beast!

AWESOME BEHIND THE SCENES OF FURIOUS 7 PART 6 !!!

Now there’s a movie called Hobs and Shaw

Those are some cheap ass glass LOL

GOOD ..NICE

Lol my friend said Jason statham can beat jackie chan. Stupid Jason statham is good but not close with Jackie jackie is crazy he does crazy stunt and so many time he nearly kill himself.

SUPER FILME I LIKE

<a href="">1:23</a> No going back for Jason, he&#39;s gone

hay rock
Think of this as a WWE TLC match. First the fight starts off with Jason kicking Rock through the window. Then it intensifies Rock drops Jason through desk and then comes the interesting part Jason gets Rock Bottomed through the table.

I dunno why the glass didn&#39;t cut em.

I could watch jason statham fight all day!
