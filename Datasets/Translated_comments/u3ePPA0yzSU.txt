Like if you&#39;re watching this on 2024. In addition, every time I get back to watch this video, I keep getting impressed.

nah ed was sing to his guitar and anne was singing to ed\

She is clearly into ed or she&#39;s flirty in nature

Молодцы!!!! Здорово!!!!

I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Mm, we were only 11

But acting like grown-ups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;

Well, I guess that was true (ooh)

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to 18

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)

Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh-oh ooh-oh

On the day we fell in love, love, love

<a href="">1:20</a> ouh and expression

I love both of them so much very happy to see them together ️️



Интересно каких они богов придумают

Я видел ящерку. С языком в глазуНе чида, а ссииСпасисохрани

Anne marie and ed sheeran

Who knew drew Barrymore could sing so good ‍️



The way she&#39;s looking at him is just.... ️

In 2002 I was 20 and also in love. It was one of the best years of my life.

Call me gay but Ed will always be something unexplainable 



I am in the exacerbation stage of my depression and anxiety disorder and came across this video. I&#39;m sitting and crying, because happiness is so simple. Beautiful song, artists and their emotions. I know my comment will get lost among others and never be seen by anyone, I just want to write that it would be nice to smile like this someday.

Anyone here from 2023 or 2024?

This feels like when you jam with your friends in an empty classroom, after school hours. Really wholesome and just pure

love the kungfu intro

I miss the 2018 era. It was totally Anne marie&#39;s! I love her.

The guitar seems so silent inspite thier voice 

RAW TALENT NO MICROPHONES OR RECORDING STUDIO POLISH !!! SOOO GOOD!!

Ver ela cantando e gesticulando é viciante se ta doido uai

Where’s the music now 

LOVING THIS

I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Uh, we were only eleven

But acting like grown-ups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;

Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to eighteen

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)

Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young, uh

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends

Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

On the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

On the day we fell in love, love, love

Anne-marie somehow resembles a young Drew B…

This is better than the video.  100% awesome.

this is so beautiful song  i like this song and listion this more timelyrics and guitar music more beautiful

If only my guy friends knew how to play the guitar. I&#39;d love to jam this with them. But atleast we have Anne and ed doing it 

Stay with whoever looks at you the way Marie looks at ED

I will always remember

The day you kissed my lips Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002 We were only eleven

But acting like grownups

Like we are in the present

Drinking from plastic cups

Singing love is forever and ever Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]



Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods On an old Mustang, where we sang Songs with all our childhoods friends

And it went like this, say



[Chorus]



Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time 

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs



[Verse 2]



Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to eighteen We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002



[Pre-Chorus]



Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods On an old Mustang, where we sang Songs with all our childhoods friends And it went like this, say



[Chorus]



Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with Better hit me, baby, one more time Paint a picture for you and me

meOf the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love



On the day we fell in love [Pre-Chorus]



Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods On an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhoods friends



Oh, now [Chorus]



Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me Of the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love On the day we fell in love, love, love

And of course this is not on Spotify 

Wow my favorite TWO . Love you two soooooooo musc

Anne MArie super amazing voice and songs!

<a href="">0:12</a>

Rlq

lovely couple

Maybe this is why Ed Sheeran is a better singer than we realise...Because he doesn&#39;t go &quot;uh&quot; or laugh while performing and ruining the song

I will always remember the day you kissed me lips

Light as a feather

And it went just like this

No, it&#39;s never been better

Than the summer of 2002

We were only eleven

But acting like grownups

Like we are in the present, drinking from plastic cups

Singing love is forever and ever

Well, I guess that was true



[Pre-Chorus]

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

Of an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhoods friends

And it went like this, yeah



[Chorus]

Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs



[Verse 2]

Now we&#39;re under the covers

Fast forward to eighteen

We are more than lovers

Yeah, we are all we need

When we&#39;re holding each other

I&#39;m taken back to 2002

On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love



[Pre-Chorus]

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

Of an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhoods friends

Oh, now



[Chorus]

Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me

Better hit me, baby, one more time

Paint a picture for you and me

Of the days when we were young

Singing at the top of both our lungs

On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love

On the day we fell in love, love, love

Beautiful voice! They actually looked like they had fun doing this...... AWESOME!!

静電気？

Anne-Marie&#39;s voice does not need auto tune. Her voice already sounds one even when there&#39;s no autotune.



Is that Drew Barrymore!?

Just awesome 

Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!

<a href="">2:54</a> A Anne desafinado nessa parte  torna o vídeo totalmente original!! Bela escolha dos dois não removerem essa parte.

This song and “Clover Cage - The Road to Awakening” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you

love this

Oh Buddha! Her voice is truly inspirational. It&#39;s natural, the tone is pure, unique, free and there&#39;s playfulness in it, it&#39;s amazing to hear the material that makes up her sound. Feel and enjoy, I&#39;m addicted to it, my hand and mind can&#39;t stop clicking!

If you live a life of sin, lust, do not serve God, do not walk in his commandments, you are blind and I am the one who is warning you to change direction so as not to fall into the abyss. God does not force anyone to serve him, however when we do not serve God, we are automatically serving the evil one. Many will say: But I am honest, I do not steal, I am fair, etc. No one can pay their own price, only Jesus was able to pay the high price for all of us, so that whoever believes in him may not perish in the abyss, but have eternal life with God. Read the Bible!

Why do i want Ed to sing this song by himself

I like your voice

The &quot;ooh-ooh&quot;s from Anne Marie are soooo similar to Cars Outside by James Arthur

Essa música tem uma vibe dahora

Cute collab, i love it

will always rememberThe day you kissed my lipsLight as a featherAnd it went just like thisNo, it&#39;s never been betterThan the summer of 2002 (ooh)Uh, we were only elevenBut acting like grown-upsLike we are in the presentDrinking from plastic cupsSinging, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;Well, I guess that was trueDancing on the hood in the middle of the woodsOn an old Mustang, where we sangSongs with all our childhood friendsAnd it went like this, sayOops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, byeHold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with meBetter hit me, baby, one more time, uhPaint a picture for you and meOn the days when we were young, uhSinging at the top of both our lungsNow we&#39;re under the coversFast forward to eighteenWe are more than loversYeah, we are all we needWhen we&#39;re holding each otherI&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)YeahDancing on the hood in the middle of the woodsOn an old Mustang, where we sangSongs with all our childhood friendsAnd it went like this, sayOops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, byeHold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with meBetter hit me, baby, one more time, uhPaint a picture for you and meOn the days when we were young, uhSinging at the top of both our lungsOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohDancing on the hood in the middle of the woodsOn an old Mustang, where we sangSongs with all our childhood friendsOh, nowOops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, byeHold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with meBetter hit me, baby, one more timePaint a picture for you and meOn the days when we were youngSinging at the top of both our lungsOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohOn the day we fell in loveOoh ooh, ooh oohOn the day we fell in love, love, love

I don’t even know much about her, but it’s crazy how many catchy hooks this song has. Every part is catchy enough to be a chorus. It’s quite impressive.

Childhood friends
