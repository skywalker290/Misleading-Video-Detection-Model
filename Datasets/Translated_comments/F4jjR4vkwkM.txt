That's a fake!!! Anyone who doesn't notice that didn't hear the shot
If I was the bus driver I wouldn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry

English subtitles please? Or anyone in here speak this langauge and can translate please?

<a href="">0:19</a>

Carglass repairs, Carglass replaces...
<a href="">0:20</a> when you realize you are screwed up

The complete bush isn't there?
Lol

Yes, where did you learn schifoahn, say amol
hilarious
This is soo much funnier when you understand german Xd

Gugelli!
no one except them looked at the queue for the ski lift, did not react when the driver approached, he looked at the entire window, he did not know where the ski would be drawn! fake video!
GUGELLI

One of the video that most make me laugh ever!!!!!!!!

It's a quarter to 11... but it's about to get dark, right? Haha
... its a commercial video for the austrian ski team. The &quot;ski acrobat&quot; ist Didier Cuche, the best swiss professional skidriver. Very funny.

xD

The way the bus driver&#39;s behaving it seems fake.But where&#39;s the ski he flicked off his foot?

Omg!  lol :D

Even with the mistake at <a href="">1:08</a> it would be a reasonable fake but the fact that they don&#39;t film the window for longer and that no one reacts to the noise gives it away. Assuming it isn&#39;t just scripted it seems plausible that the bus driver had a go at them for kicking the skis near the bus and hence gave them the idea to edit it like this.

please add subtitles!

well that&#39;s a first

What is the name of the show with the melody at the end? That was a cartoon with two crazy people. I hope someone else knows it and can tell me what it was called.
how is that possible when both skis are still on the ground.. just asking

HAHAHAHA

super!!!!!!!!!

muananda of the mish gfaked, who is so stupid and just walks away from the video on türa ski in another türara bus?
At <a href="">1:08</a> both skis are still on the ground, hahahaaa, so bad. And the reactions are completely unnatural.
Its very funny, but fake at <a href="">1:08</a> you can see the second ski xD

Faaake, even the angle isn&#39;t right! :D

Yes, where did you learn to drive? in Switzerland! Yes, I guess you think you're the biggest one here? The bus driver is top notch
DER KOMPLETTE BUS IST HIN, SIEHST DU DAS NICHT?

Fake and Gay

&quot;The entire bus is gone&quot; !!! xD
lachflash pur!!! HAHAHA

Fake as fuck. It would&#39;ve fallen down way before even hitting the bus, but I guess all the retarded facebook kids will spam this shit everywhere again, saying &quot;OHH HEHEHE LOOK SO REAL MEEN, DAT GUY SO STUPEEED&quot;.

Yep, fake. At <a href="">1:06</a> you can see again both skis...
