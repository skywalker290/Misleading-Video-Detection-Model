Alia mam is the best.

Hey Alia....You probably don&#39;t have the time to read this, but I really hope that you are and if you are, then please please reply...anyway...I love you soooooooo much and I&#39;m your biggesttttt fan ever...I wanna say something, to you...So, I honestly don&#39;t know where to start...but, oh my God! You truly define perfection..Your talent, which you&#39;re genuinely speaking, a storehouse of...acting, singing, dancing, dressing sense ( even though you&#39;ll look pretty in bad clothes also, not that your clothes are bad anyway )..Specially acting, your performance, in Raazi is genuinely the BEST performance I&#39;ve seen, by any actor or actress, in the universe....Usually, if someone&#39;s talented, specially because of family background, they don&#39;t exactly get or even deserve a lot of credit, but you do..coz, you&#39;re not only born with talent, but also the way you nurture it, the fact that you&#39;re so modest about it ( always striving for more, never thinking you&#39;re too good, the way you always use the word try, for your upcoming success, you&#39;re never sure and showing off, you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re not great though you&#39;re not doing it for pity, but just btw, just so you know, you are great,accepting your mistakes, coming face to face with them and learning, from them, never forgetting old people who were there for you, despite not needing them anymore ) and the hardwork that you keep doing really improves it...Some other things I love about you are the fact that you&#39;re such a sweet, respectful, friendly and helpful person. You&#39;re a beautiful soul....you&#39;re such a fair, non-partial, non-bias person....you always include everyone, you never give anyone that bad vibe kinda thing..You&#39;re also very honest and say things the way they are, without hurting anyone, for example that thing you were talking about in yours and Varun&#39;s interview, with Film Companion, about how if you don&#39;t like someone&#39;s movie, you say, &quot;Only you could have made such a film. Now, you don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing.&quot;...lol..that&#39;s such a good way, to be nice and honest, at the same time. You&#39;re also so so good, at keeping secrets, with a polite way of not disclosing them. You have such a good sense of humour, everyone trolled you, for a lil slip of tongue and you managed to joke about yourself, which is pretty comendable. Your interaction with fans and media is so good, with the fact that you truly care, about your fans and you never refuse for selfies and that video you made for Rishabh Chaturvedi was really sweet and during the video, when you said that he&#39;s made your year, if I were in his place, I&#39;d say that you&#39;ve made our life, by entertaining us, not just year.... You&#39;re so humble, graceful, pleasant, happy, cool, easy, yourself in front of everyone, extremely well-mannered/well brought up. You&#39;re even nice, to those who troll you....I really really admire, look up to and take inspiration from you...I love that something in you, which can attract everyone, towards you and you&#39;re really really at me....I even adore evey lil detail, about you, like the way you walk, talk, carry &amp; conduct yourself, breath, blink and sooo much more! I also love the way you&#39;re happy for other stars&#39; success and you wish for them, you&#39;re never jealous, you smile and clap, even on their achievements....I promise that you don&#39;t need to worry about the Sushant trolls, you&#39;re not to blame....Not to mention, you&#39;re all this, despite whatever you&#39;ve gone through, like Shaheen&#39;s depression, Pooja&#39;s trauma, Rahul leaving you guys..whatever Mahesh Bhatt has done to people, which I won&#39;t be disclosing here, coz I&#39;m not sure, if you&#39;ll be comfortable, with the entire world knowing about *that*, but you get it...Also, you&#39;re all these good things, despite being trolled on every lil thing, like a lil slip of tongue, accidentally abusing during a talk and choosing to kill Sushant, in a hypothetical situation. You&#39;re &#39;shaandaar&#39; and &#39;first class&#39;. I don&#39;t think anyone can have &#39;kalank&#39; with you. You deserve the student of the lifetime, not just year. Thank you, for always inspiring me and keeping me entertained, with your flawless acting and endearing personality...These are the things that I love about you and sooooo much more...so, there&#39;s a lot more I wanna thank you for and a lot more compliments you deserve ( which I wanna give ), but I&#39;ll leave it to that here and keep more stuff, to tell you, on the best day of my life, when I meet you, which&#39;ll hopefully be, during this lifetime.

Mam I&#39;m big big biggg fan of your ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Happy birthday

Why u r not in video.😔😔😔

I just get so much inspiration from you ❤❤❤❤❤
I love you❤️
Wow bravo!!! Look who promoting this. That celebrity who wear designer clothes just for one time use.

If you know all the facts, then start normalising the fact that celebrities too can repeat outfits. And make their skin care products at home. The cosmetic brands you use and promote and endorse, all contain microbeads which is plastic. When you wash your face, you are again polluting the water bodies. You have many followers, I think this one step by you will encourage a lot of people in India. Maybe even other celebrities too.

Nice thought Alia 😍😍😍 Aiia unique actress Film industry 💋💋💋
How is it that a single dress or cloth, by celebrities ,for reuse is being available for everybody for shopping?

If you&#39;re so environment conscious why fly in your private jet for bramharstra and not take a flight like the rest of us? I&#39;ve never seen you in the same outfit either, what about that? You live in ridiculously big houses for how small your families are, throw lavish parties and what not and then come on social media to teach average earners about how to avoid environmental catastrophe.

HIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Aliya bhatta Your So Beautiful I love u
Faltu video

Why don’t you break the stereotype of wearing new clothes every time? You guys are the one who advertises and supports fast fashion. Off course you can recycle your enormous closet, but can we focus more on manufacturing less and consuming less. I think being a influencer can create a great impact on fast fashion, and less consumption.

This is hypocrisy ,you are advising to middle class people but you yourself not able to follow this , you know it&#39;s very easy to advise others .I am not saying that it&#39;s wrong neither l am criticizing you but you should have followed this in your life before uploading this video before giving this so called  knowledge to us

Alia please tell Ekta Kapoor to release Kasam season 2 soon.
Fashion for a cause? Hypocrisy at a different level. Okay I have this top that I bought this top I loved at first sight but now it&#39;s just lying in my wardrobe and most probably I won&#39;t be wearing it, so would you like to buy and wear for 9 months? I&#39;ll attach a tag if you&#39;d like.

If ur really concerned about environment give it for free.. don&#39;t try to monetize everything..

hypocritical

Can anyone believe that you&#39;re watching this video on the YouTube channel of a girl who was bullied for being empty headed.....well done alia keep grooming

My love, my love, my life, my life, my sister, when will you come to me? Please come here 😩🙏❤💋
Please make a video on shopping under 12000

Oh beauty i m your biggest fan in pak

Opt for linen products they pollute water less and are ecofriendly. Tell the people working for the initiative.

Superb 💕❤️Aloo
And if you think that then sell them for free

So you guys now think that we should wear your used clothes ... and if earths in danger why shouldnt you reuse your clothes and wear them yourself

I wear a set of cloth for almost like &quot;till it is torn apart&quot; days

What a boring video on a boring day

Why don't I wear my own clothes or wear my used clothes? Why don't I wear my own clothes? I am a normal human being and I don't care about money.
Fee Months later :- Alia playing PUBG and be le like Thanks for the 40 Rupees Super Chat.

Alia... Can u do one thing...I really want to show super30 movie to those kids who works in a factory or they are labour... but I don&#39;t have enough money to do so...coZ m unemployed...but u have so much money...so plz donate some money n ur tym to make someone&#39;s Carrier.... support those kids who are suffering from financial problems...Or those who are physically challenged...Don&#39;t waste ur time in making this YouTube vedios u r already famous so u not need to do dis... 2lakh...5lakh ka bag mat kharido... Usme b utna hi smaan rakh paogi jitna hum normal girls Indore k rajwada se 200 me kharidti h...Itne peso se kisi garib bachhe ki fee pay kardo Jo padhna chahta ho....N seriously ur vedios are not helpful for us...

I support the cause and I&#39;ll do my bit by purchasing less clothes and by donating the clothes I don&#39;t wear

Please show your everyday makeup look

Its really amazing alia sis im aa huge fan of u plss rplyyyy plss

Thank you for spreading a good message Alia, love u!

Hey Alia, make a video on what&#39;s on ur closet..

This is RightBut my question to you actors is will you guys do the same when it comes to you??Will you buy and wear your costars  Clothes???The video is Right  and we should save our Environment.But will u people also do the same??

Why are people so foolish as to buy clothes worn by celebrities. We are all mortals and I suppose even the richest or the most powerful person or the most famous celebrity  with their  excessive wealth, still wipe their own ass ( unless paralysed and is unable to do so) after their business. Just my opinion, I may be wrong though. I do admire Amitabh Bachchan for his philanthropic work on the farmers of India. May he live a good healthy life and his wealth multiplied.

u r very powerful. make some videos to influence people in a positive way.

So you can&#39;t repeat your clothes but want us to think that you have a conscience that sees environmental degradation? Your hypocrisy must be blushing.

Or you could just, you know, donate your clothes Alia. Not like you aren&#39;t rich enough to afford that.

Rather than creating a chain of biodegradable mess. You can straight way contribute to these causes and practice sustainable/organic clothing. It&#39;s not a win-win situation, this is pushing down the waste to the next cycle. The amount of waste is not reduced for the environment, just your are promoting more consumerism by re-wearing the celebrity&#39;s wardrobe.

Mam main Brahmi I want to tell you are great actor

Mother, what is the truth?
Why I Hate Alia Bhatt ? Check in this video😑 .. <a href="">

<a href=""> this is called sustainable

<b>my fvrt aliya bhatt</b>

So Cute and Pretty Ma&#39;am our Team Like you we work in Orphan Organization <b>Asha Deep Foundation</b>

Why are you doing this alia bhatt u have the thing Bollywood which we all dont have so plse leave YouTube

It would rather be helpful to those poor people if you give it in charity

Lead by example babe.. wear your own clothes for 3 years , that will send out a bigger message.

Hii.... Alia

Can&#39;t afford ur clothes,rather i buy cotton clothes and use it as many time as I can. i would suggest u guys to wear production clothes and repeat it as many a time as u can .... This will send a good msg....

Who operates your channel?
Companies like zara and h&amp;m straightway burn their clothes rather than recycling it. A personal note to Alia Bhatt, thanks to your PR team you are present almost everywhere, don&#39;t just start a company that&#39;s sole intention is to upgrade your market value in the name of SAVING ENVIRONMENT. The way you pretend to act is the same way you are pretending to be of some social cause.

Is this called affordable?
All the best Alia di for your future and may god bless you 😄

Mene saltscout site dekhi par is par products bahut expensive hai ,.......which are not affordable to us 😶😶😶😶

Great thought aliaaa

Nice

We are buying your clothes and u are buying new ones. Ultimately new clothes are being manufactures and purchased. Are you guys yourself using the old ones from the other celebrities wardrobe? obviously not. Where is the difference that you are making madam? FYI Prices of the clothes arevery high. One can buy new one in half of that price.

Maybe if y’all could have worn those clothes few more times rather than buying a new one and telling us to buy your old ones at a high rate would’ve been far more better :)

Hello mast he videoMy Youtube channel Ko bi dekhe py
To all those people who say charity starts at home and these celebrities should wear their clothes again and again rather than asking us to do so ..... listen , most of the celebs have brands to endorse , they do what they gotta do ... when youve got the paps following you everywhere... repeating clothes will end them in headlines — “ breaking news “ Alia wore the same crop top to the beach today she wore 2 days ago on her brunch with katrina .. you are the first ones to get upset if they stop serving you fresh new looks everyday.

Hiiiii

Alia di do you love ranbir sir plz tell naa💖💖💖 luv uu alia
Alia Bhatt is the very ugly actress very very ugly

Alia Bhatt&#39;s Own YouTube Channel..

Why this video??

So basically you won&#39;t stop buying high end brand clothing,where each t shirt can cost in the tune of lakhs, and you want a reason to keep buying new stuff so you want us to wear your used clothes?! Such a noble idea.. no seriously! Really noble! 👏

Love you Alia.....😍😍
A request from Alia&#39;s fan to All the fanz out thr........ pls check ma youtube channel too n subs....n help me grow...<a href="">

Denouncing the whole Indian textile industry in your social media  which contributes to more than 45 million jobs in India just to promote your new brand so that you can earn some extra bucks yeah sounds about right

Well... great initiative dear Alia but I guess it&#39;s still expensive as everyone wants to contribute to the earth but can&#39;t afford....and I really need that you request celebrities to drop the prices.

Instead of talking about stopping fast fashion she&#39;s talking about buying clothes from celebs closets....Girl aren&#39;t you the one who dons Zara and h&amp;m...who have worst sustainability in fabrics and ethics which they work upon...instead of encouraging us to buy from your closet encourage people to first stop following trends which you guys begin...

Love you Alia😍😍😍
I really like your sister very much..she is very adorable,natural beauty and a very strong actress...send my wishes to her...

Love you alia
I thought we will see u on this channel. Idea may be noble but price?

What are you doing, what are you doing in Bollywood? Ab science has been developed in fashion industry.
Right h alooo

Make a video in Hindi
Stop this drama plz ..leave youtube and do something really good..u already have so much🙏🏻

Too fast video

Alia you are just all in one... Which is called sarbagun Sampan..

Ya,  we always donate  our cloths or recycle it

Mental bathu
!!

So why dont celebrities start reusing their clothes and wearing them more often? Why do you have to sell your clothes and expect us to reuse them. Charity begins at home.

By the way Alia Madam, you are the who posted the comments/views Money Control ? It is in your name with your photo. Please clarify. Because, some one else may be faking your name.

I  love you alia❤❤❤❤you are the best..

You are one of the first youtubers I have watched who posted a full video to address a problem, not many people do that, keep up the good work and I believe what you are doing is great as I am also trying to help whenever I can...  :  )Edit: All those people who disliked the video...why? Just WHY?? I mean did you think the video wasn&#39;t worth your time? Help is appreciated but if you don&#39;t want to help then please, still like the video so many more people watch it and come know about this...Thx :)

Its nice but not too much 😆

Alia is so concerned about our environment. Love you

1800 for a t-shirt is not affordable, neither is 25000 rupees worth anarkali, my 5 month&#39;s rent is less than the cost of the anarkali.... This is not social work....

Aliya likho plz name mat. spoil it
Mi casa is su casa

Im big fan of you

Plz share some workout session of ur

Thank god somebody who is an influential personality is talking about this issue and raising awareness here on a big social networking platform. This is the way the celebrities should utilise their position to influence people for such serious issues of earth. Aliya please also support this causes by repeating your worn clothes within some months so that it has more strong effects on people who follow you. If any media person criticise you for this, teach them too, instantly.

Amazing initiative...plz speak on it personally too ..just this presentation would not do ..u r an idol for many

I never thought alia bhatt is so nice she thinks about the earth also for alia my respect is double now

Yes, be the voice.. you have the power to bring the change

Love u❤❤❤
Love you di

Why do you keep showing false nonsense, why do you waste your time watching false videos? Watch this study, motivation, informative videos, you will not get much knowledge, this is a waste of time.
Hey if you are on this to connect with your fans do it all on your own. I don&#39;t think these animation and editing can be learned so easily by anyone especially when you have just got your channel running. We will appreciate it more if you do it even if it&#39;s not so great editing and all. Thats how all youtubers grow by own effort.

Alia u  are d first actress to thinks about environment...... We are so proud of u........ Love u aloo😍😘

narration dalo isme! , koi btaye inhe ki  Video or PPT me fark hota he,

This is needless to say..... middle class people don&#39;t spend much on their &quot;wardrobe&quot;.... So the major environmental threat is perhaps the &#39;stink&#39; from the wardrobes of you glamorously.. Fashionably heightened bunch of people.... So clean up the mess u hav created....

I use my clothes 2 to 3 years.

LOVE ❤️
Now YouTube also,keep going girl

So happy to see uh after long time
