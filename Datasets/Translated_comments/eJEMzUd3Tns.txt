&quot;We&#39;re playing Terraria. This game is so fun.&quot;<b>Abandons it for 3 years and doesn&#39;t even finish it</b>

5 stars for mana

<a href="">3:40</a> how is pewdiepie so lucky

<a href="">3:41</a> Pewds luck, thats quite the rare stuff

Felix reads the chat: <b>DON&#39;T GO DOWN</b>Also Felix when he died: <b>WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU TELL ME?</b>

the fact PewDiePie&#39;s first world in terraria is so good tho.

<a href="">22:20</a>

Bro, his Even better building houses than me😮😮

Bro accidentally found the hero sword

Bro I’m gonna freak out in that fact the he keeps replacing his mining helmet over the armoire. He had cool set bonus but ruined it because of the mining helmet

Xandeleabara  XD <a href="">8:51</a>
hes so lucky damn
More

Felix: I died twice!!Me: died 20 times to the twins

<a href="">13:20</a> Chance to slime king spawns is 1% !! thats rare

<a href="">14:02</a> bro literally missed the opportunity to grab a water bolt

It feels like Brotherhood to se another person figth a boss on ground no platform

<a href="">15:43</a>

Good thing je doesn&#39;t have to fight that shitty brain od crimson

<a href="">14:34</a> Epic gamer moment

That&#39;s to make the zenith the most powerful

I&#39;ve killed 950 of the eater of souls

I might have started crying when pewdiepie kill the penguin

how has he found every amazing item so quickly??

<a href="">3:40</a> he found it that easily?! Dude even I make like 5 world then I found that freaking sword on the sixth world I made lol

Ah yes, Mushroom Shandeliabura
bro at <a href="">5:38</a> he went AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA😂😂😂😂😂😂

<a href="">13:47</a> is that a water bolt?

I like how he accidentally summons bosses

Bro found the rarest sword by accident when I had to use a special seed to get it 😭

<a href="">3:44</a> he is so lucky

bro is actually so lucky wtf?

waltuh, waltuh you should have not got in that dungeon i told you

which world seed was he using... cause i need an enchanted sword to make the zenith

u can capture stinkbug in forest where u put house and u can kill npc using stinkbug is used to craft a poop sword

dung guard is unfair

<a href="">3:00</a> eater of holes

What is the seed?

That enchanted sword find was beautiful omg, such a random dynamite drop on the right place

<a href="">16:57</a> America moment
I just became good at the game i didnt realise enchanted swords are so good i got one on my first world

I remember once I found a glitch in terraria where I couldn&#39;t take damage and somehow defeated those skeleton heads in the dungeon very easily

Lol

Cool

yo

GAMERS

AHHHHH

He just ran past the angler guy

Chat:DONT GO DOWN THEREpewdiepie:CHAT WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME???

Dude, his luck is nuts. A casual enchanted sword at low level. . I just found the Murasama, it&#39;s dope asf

bro ive been playing for  hours trying to find the enchanted sword and felix finds it accidentally beginners luck is crazy

how in hell does he, a Terraria beginner, not even with days of experience, know how to build better than me who has been playing for 4 years now????

Why does he have a meteorite

Felix: <b>breaks 2 shadow orbs</b>My stress levels: <b>100% stressed</b>Felix going down the dungeon:My stress levels: <b>19929201082019%</b>

Also, noice

I like Terraria and I like pewds.... two things I like into one video

<a href="">2:22</a> Why does that zooming noise get me everytime lmao

<a href="">13:46</a> First encounter with Chippy Gaming

I hope you didn&#39;t  trash the copper shortsword

<a href="">11:48</a> music name anyone?

<a href="">4:00</a> I&#39;m crying rn

Run boy run is actually a song go search it up

Want until he realises there is a calamity mod that makes terraria a whole new game

Where can i find this video --&gt; <a href="">10:40</a>

I always test my damage by seeing which types of slimes I can one-shot.

I think it&#39;s crazy that Felix actually managed to beat EoW first try 😂 j died instantly on my first play through

I like how his house improves every episode, but the hellevator in the house- and going into the dungeon...

It took me 10 small seeds to get an enchanted sword

In  jorney mode you Can have infinite items if you have the right amount

so many events happning in one epiosode and alot of cool items to as well as alot of bosses

&quot;Za fook was zat??&quot;
I’m gonna fight the eye of Cthulhu on my terraria world  tomorrow

its so easy in classic and journey 😂

PAIN PAIN PAIN THERE WAS A RARE PLANT AND HE JUST WALKED RIGHT PAST IT IM SO TRIGGERED!!!!!!!!!!!!! <a href="">17:35</a> the purple plant. Edit: theres another rare plant <a href="">18:54</a> the orange plant.

Watched 3 times

My opinion about terraria Gameplay 8/10 Soundtracks 10/10Detail 9/10Enjoyment 9/10 one of best games ever existed points: 10/10Total: 46/50

Let&#39;s bring PewDiePie back to play terraria

Isnt the dungeon guardian supposed to kill you when you get too close to hell?

Did any one see the slime with the unbrella

i like how everyone keeps telling him in the chat not to go down then he gets killed by skeletron and was like WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME

&quot;Eat my balls and marinate them&quot; -pewdiepie

Why does Mr beast have 83.6M sub and pewdiepie have 110M sub I thought Mr beast is the famous

Lmao I thought he was gonna summon the eater of worlds

Fun fact you can ether have a corruption world or a crimson world Pa PewDiePie has a corruption world

Pewdiedie there more sword is CALLS bee sword

other dudes need to try hard yo defeat teh eather of world and pewds does it in a cave in les then 20 minutes 🤣

Seeing him stacking NPC houses on top of each other is just pure PAIN for me

When he went down I was waiting for his reaction to the dungeon guardian

WHEN HE SAW METEOR he be like me touch meteor me die

<a href="">2:46</a> DON FLAMENCO!!

In his first playthrough, his house is 100X better then my 3rd playthrough

<a href="">2:22</a>))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

<a href="">2:45</a> bro how have I played so much Punch Out Wii to immediately recognize this sound bite as Don Flamenco.

hey PewDiePie,did you know if You can make MLG in Terraria,is possible,put a cobweb under you before you hit the ground and you dot have fall damage!

Bro I&#39;m so mad I decided to start watching this cuz I rly got into terraria for a few weeks and I&#39;ve been looking for the ES for so long and he just finds it by accident it took me a whole ass 3 days to find a single one for the zenith, I don&#39;t even get to keep the actual sword

Terraria vets: OMG HES LEARNING Felix:(dies by dungeon guardian)Terraria vets: very very slowly...

6.12 why did the eye not dash? I tought i can?

He found that sword like nothing and it took me 5 whole maps

Hi

“There’s 50billion I counted” -pewdiepie

Fans:dont go downnn 👇 pewdiepie:(keeps going down) died&#39;&#39;why didn&#39;t you tell me&#39;&#39;
Omg this dude is soo lucckyy

<a href="">16:29</a> &quot;what happend to this game , it&#39;s use to be innocent&quot; , no this game it isn&#39;t innocent at all

Lojic of Terraria ~YOU CAN SEE THE ZOMBIE OUT THE DOOR~

Don&#39;t talk to the old man at night because you will summon the skeleton

This happened to i wason mediumcore rip my stuff :(  it was funny though because it was sudden lol gg terraria you got me good

<a href="">6:34</a>PewDiePie: I have a zombie arm? Where did I get that from?Me: probably a zombie

Pewdiepie is a sith confirmedAlso, by using a space gun he has confirmed himself to be uncivilized

Epic clutch when he was falling and then he grappled to the block

pewds&#39;s reaction to 2nd phase to the eye of chutulu is priceless

You get to see his reaction to eye of cuthulu 2nd phase, Hell, and dungeon guardian in one video!

Hi past water bolt

<a href="">0:08</a> I Agree.

<a href="">14:32</a> We all learn things in the heat of passion, jimbo

Funny when he’s freaking out when he still has like a 100 health

chat: dont go down the pewdiepie:dies also pewdiepie: why didnt you tell me

Nonstop YA 77 was here

How do I make a house in this game

Genital house

Jesus be like BRUUUUH

Why hasn&#39;t he done a hardmode playthrough

Pewds makes my brain hurt in this game

Mower

I love how he unconsciously realised &quot;I&#39;ve been playing all day&quot; and said it out loud out of nowhere, and proceeded to play without a blink of an eye.

There a lot happening in this video, he finally killed the EOC, he accidentally summon a King Slime, he entered the dungeon without any preparation, breaking the Shadow Orbs not knowing he will summon the boss, meteorite and battling the goblin armies 🙂

Normal mode moment

Don't forget like you
Everybody gangsta until he gets into hell and says “I’ve returned”

Pewdepie : &quot;I&#39;m A coward&quot; <b>music intensifies</b>
there are no lightsabers in minecraft  becose that make the game so dumb

not good like minecraft minecraftr is top 1

I liked the forest gump reference

Where the i should have listen part🙌👐

<a href="">21:37</a> I made the same mistake but instead of 1 it was 5

Wish he played expert lol

Anyone else here suddenly got this video as suggestions?

Me: The EoC doesn&#39;t dash?Also me: <b>Realized I play terraria in expert for first time</b>

kills eye of cthulu* dies to king slime*

me after watching <a href="">6:07</a> of the video: never mind you can beat the eye of cthulhu

no cap i have actually beaten the game 11 times

Me who has already beaten the game 11 times:Someone as bad as you can&#39;t beat the eye of cthulhu with that loot

<a href="">22:15</a> &lt;- the exact moment when Pewds falls onto two measly tiles of cobweb after a 50 tile high panic dive, purely by chance and oblivious of the fact, a split second before he falls onto the ground. Which resets the fall counter iirc.Sweet Baby Cthulhu...

<a href="">21:50</a> wait till he sees the unicorns

<a href="">6:33</a> Pewds: &quot;I have a zombie arm. Where did i get that from?&quot;Me: <b>Surprised pikachu</b>

Use water bucket

Has he ever posted the seed for this?

This video will not leave my auto playlist. I’ve removed it so many times wtf

Imagine being able to beat the EoC but not the King Slime, F.

Jungle and dungeon are at different ways

HIS LUCK IS UNBALANCED

Pp lol

He didn’t even grab the water boltttt

Give me you seed pewds please I need it

pewdiepie craft the zenith sword

Do not enter corrupted Hole Or worm kill you

even when i eas playing terraria for first time i went in there there were two who killed me and went back  they were horrible

Pewds: i helped an eye before now ill take one down

I have 2000 hours in terraria (dont have a life) and its so nice to see Felix experience everything for the first time.

&quot;Bats are so small and annoying&quot;Lava bats : well yes but actually no

His Ikea house looks good

pewds: &quot;come back!&quot;2 seconds later: &quot;Get off my property&quot;

The all boss in terraria is guardian in the dungeon and moon lord and impress of light and king slime and wall of flesh and qeen slime and eater of the world and skeletron and duke the fishrune and mech big boss and martians and goblin and pirates and and golem and plantera and lot of more

Spoken like a true American <a href="">16:58</a>

Don&#39;t forget that there is sus in jesus

PewDiePie dies: WHY DID YOU NOT TELL MEFive seconds earlier: they say don&#39;t go down well I&#39;m going anyway

Pewds: this guy came nowNorsum: it&#39;s a good day to die!Pewds: i agree

EoW on first try without prep and a beginner... I’m impressed.

Haha

He has done the initiation of Going to the Dungeon Pre-Skeletron

This was equivalent to sleeping in the nether, except for people warned him not to do it

<a href="">14:37</a>Top 10 pictures taken right before disaster

He is worthy!

<a href="">2:47</a> punch-out!!

If you are amazed by enchanted sword, wait till you see terra blade and zenith

This is like what he did in minecraft in the nether with a bed

It&#39;s easy to beat the eye of cthu

Go up

Ok, I know I’m a year late.But Felix is a noob and somehow beat Eye Of Cthulhu before King Slime.He actually may be a veteran.

He got Eater of Worlds first ever encounter. I think that&#39;s pretty damn amazing.

Pewdiepie: WHAT THE F*CK IS THAT
Beers
&quot;What is this game at this point?&quot;It&#39;s a sandbox game XD It has absolutely tons of jokes and references, it contains tons of nerd culture

&quot;Why doesn&#39;t Minecraft have lightsabers?&quot; he asksBecause Minecraft was built based on the idea of simplicity... and Terraria was definitely not, it has very complex crafting trees, many tiers and varieties of a f*** ton of things

I have over 200 hours in terraria, post moon lord gear, and I have never found an enchanted sword. And pewds finds it before the EoC

he got very lucky finding that sword lol

When i played Terraria with my friend for the first time, we made a nightmare pickaxe and he said “wow, i can’t believe i have the second best pickaxe in the game!”Those were simpler times

Terrraria has been my fav game of all time since it came out but no that pewds played it everyone i know keeps saying that i found the game out from him. They always say be careful hat you wish dont they

Fun Fact Of Water Of Worlds Boss:They Get Weaker When They Get Smaller

The bros: DoN&#39;T Go DoWn, dOn&#39;t gO DoWn!Felix: <b>Goes down and gets killed</b>The bros: .........Felix: WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU TELL ME?!!?!?!?!?

Why does the title say I should have listened if he beat the eye of cothulu.

I literally cryed watching this did anyone else notice the water bolt?

Whats is SEEEEED?! DATS EPIC

WHY

Pewdiepie:kills the boss in 3 minutes  Me:dies before I even get to look at the boss

this is painful

&quot;screams echo around you&quot;Felix: epic

Felix: I’m getting a lot of nos...Felix: (dies to dungeon guardian)Felix: Why didn’t anyone tell me?

IK this vid is like a year old, but when felix put the master sword theme over him finding the enchanted sword I just got excited for some reason....

How many health do you have on terraria (I have 425 health)

how did he find the enchanted sword in his third episode and i’m on hardcore mode almost done with the game and haven’t found it 😐

Rare things that Felix didn’t know he had:Sword ShrineEye of Cululon shieldChanted swordPearlstoneHell I said hell  because he can find demons that drop voodoo dolls that if he drops in lava he can kill guild or Conner and then summon the wall of flesh which sends him and his Notorious world into hard mode so good luck Felix.Do more of terraria vids but with Mark and jack

Like this commet if I should finish my work from school

&quot;screams echo around you... epic&quot;

<a href="">10:49</a>

imagine if pewds had the crimson biome

&quot;cute penquins&quot; &quot;kills it&quot;  &quot;dead cute penquins&quot;
Did anyone notice that his web cam shut off? Like if you did

Every one: DONT GO DOWN felix: why also felix: WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU TELL ME?!?

I had to make over 20 worlds to find the enchanted sword

I literally had better stuff than he did when he killed the Eye of Cthulhu and I died 3 times

I don’t think pewds understands how hard it is to find the enchanted sword

You need to put sunflowers in the jungle

Your suppose to kill the master skull than you can go in the palce

lmao he ignored a sword shrine <a href="">1:01</a>

Felix:its getting hot in hereMe:so take of all your clothes

Finally!

Like how he just randomly found a shrine

I'm a man
Hi

<a href="">13:58</a> yrimirs just gonna suddenly reappear to tell pewds to look for a water bolt

Felix:dont freak out felixAlso felix: RUNN AWWAAYYY

Me: <b>plays terraria 10 times, always quits after beating eye of cthulhu</b>Pewdiepie: <b>accidentally beats all the bosses</b>

For the love of god that cursing censorship noise that he uses is SOOOOOO annoying

Mark and jack have there own boss lol

<a href="">3:51</a> I remember when I got that sword. It was so cool. But then my world got deleted. Idk why but I’m guessing from an update.

… I&#39;m Elite baby, don&#39;t you see the outfit? Double pumps don&#39;t matter, man I got this Shoot a rocket, and pop a mini at the same time If you put a scar in my hand, then it&#39;s game time…

Pewdiepie:*dies by dungeon guardianDungeon guardian:about to end this mans whole career

How lucky are some people, i have a end game world and i never found the enchanted sword q.q

its annoying me seeing bees in the jungle cos that means pewds mined the hive without realising

Punch out

Omg I thought I was so good at first at this game and a month latar in my large world I relize I&#39;m still not even close to beating the game

Hey pewds you gonna be a melee ranged sommoner or mage

Zombies in blood moon can Now open doors and annoying :/

He went down the dungeon..My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.

pewdiepie in blood moon:problem solvedwhat i hear:problem solved iam alpha kid

hahaha a skull head surpised pewdiepie

Pewdiepie: accidentally founds the enchanted sword.Me still trying to find it to have zenith: Life is really fun until it&#39;s unfair

2020 ANYONE????

How the fuck did he stumble upon a shrine???

I just did the same mistake

Day 367 of waiting for Felix to do a Mary Poppins with the umbrella

IS NOT FOR KIDS

Why do you say badwords

Pewdipie I thought you kill memes and didnt say badwords....

I listening pewd and hear some japanese thing like bakayaro

Is anyone not mad that he toke off the space helmet that makes his space gun cost 0 mana

I guess so

Who is still watching this after 4 years PewDiePie is changed in feature

why not get zenith
How did pewds beat the eye with 160 health and I have 300 and I did not beat him

This was  very entertaining.

<a href="">14:39</a><a href="">14:38</a>

There are so many bosses here😂😂😂

Did he miss a WATER BOLT!?

Wow He has a good seed enchanted sword is likely hard for me because I Always Kill The Wall Of Flesh First 😅lol i rewatched this after a year and now i see how much my english was barely good anyway if none understood it here &quot;Cool He Has A Good Seed, Finding Enchanted Sword is Too Hard for Me (I didn&#39;t know there was Fishing in Terraria (Fishing = Crates = Enchanted Sword)) and so I ignored it and continued with my progress and went straight ahead to kill the Wall of Flesh even tho you would probably get the enchanted sword on early and then when i found out about Zenith I was already at Empress of Light(Day) and just shocked that i would still need to really find an enchanted sword bruh well First of All I waited for many hours just to get an enchanted sword seed bruh

If the real hell was terreria I would force myself to be immortal

there is a fricking gamer cactus cross in <a href="">1:22</a>

My Eye of Cthulhu in Master mode is easy, I did not even lose a heart.

I have a better sword than you, because I have 100+ melee damage

Me with bone key. Laughs in Deep Caribbean Accent.

Pewds: Everyone’s saying don’t go down. I’m getting a lot of “no”sPewds: <b>dies to dungeon guardian</b>Also Pewds: <b>WhY DiDnT YoU TeLl mE!??</b>

Pewdiepie sees eye: DAM HE HUGEmoonlord: Am I a JoKe tO U!!!!!    U WiLl NEVeR dEFeAT meMoonlord In head: he won’t wven make it to the end of the gamePewdiepie: 24 ATTACK DAMAGEMOONLORD: HOLY S***

Is this episode of all about you dying

Pewdiepie please play more Tarria

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

i feel so jealous
ALREADY 2 minuits into the video he already found the crismon biome {Marvelous}

Overall out of terraria or Minecraft detail has to go to terraria most effort Minecraft and terraria most fun with friends Minecraft both win as they are both good games

THERE WAS A WATER BOLT IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE DUNGEON

Pewds: I think i forgot something.Sive: If you forget it then its not important.Pewds: Ok.Lunatic Cultist, 4 pillars and Moon Lord: Sad Noises

This is the real reason why you subscribed.

OMG place blocks behind door..BIG BRAIN
<a href="">14:36</a>

Hey pewdiepie are you in hard mode or not if you in hard mode you can get shild aye of chutu

I’m just waiting for Felix to find and throw the voodoo doll into the lavaHe’ll be so happy Connor is gone

I was getting SOOOOO mad when there were so many strange plants and he didn&#39;t pick them up

pewdiepie:enters jungle biomeme:PEWDIEPIE IS TARZAN
I saw the water bolt..

get star canan
You first kill boss
“That desert is so tiny, Because the corruption takes over it?”Hardmode smiling in far.

it hurts to see how many strange plants he missed

Pewds:fights eye of Cthulhu.(Jacksepticeye intensifies)

When he finds a strange plant but dosent collect makes me angry lool

guys, how do i turn on the yellow box thing when mining and placing block?

When a pro Terrarian seeing a player playing Terraria for the first time and thinks that Wall Of flesh is the last boss..

play master mode

This is his first time and he almost defeated two bosses in one episode???

How did you find all of the stuff

<a href="">14:38</a> 555555555+

In my ever first world I got the enchanted sword too. But then I sold it when I got a stronger sword, didn&#39;t know it&#39;s a material for crafting Zenith. Now I can&#39;t find it in other world. sad noisesMy little brother also got the rarer version of enchanted sword in his first world too! He got Arkhalis, which he also sold after getting better sword!

I&#39;m not look the enchant sword

I Love The Terraria!

Enchanted sword!?!Me: I have one already

im retardera
God haven&#39;t play classic mode in a while eye of culthlu is so slow XD

I give IKEA tower 5🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
pewds with a nightmare pickaxe: whoa whoa whoa i can mine everything in the gameme: <b>casually mines a lihzahrd brick with a vortex pickaxe</b>

Felix: I can mine anything in the game, temple blocks: hold my beer

What is his difficulty

How could you possibly get a zombie arm?!? Killing a zombie?!?!?

I&#39;ve been playing this game since it came out and seeing PewDiePie play it is just... <b>woah</b>

What ur seed

like how he progresses so fast without dying too much while my dumb ass be dying several times just to craft a fucking tungsten helmet

Lel <a href="">1:28</a>

Creeper

I&#39;m disappointed in you Felix. Found a good sword but no beach ball :(

How to set bed as a spawnpoint

Felix npcs have their own preferences where if you put them in specific places they sell items cheap, if they are all together than they will start getting extremely expensive.

Pewdiepie: I think were ready for the eye<b>JACKSEPTICEYE INTENSIFIES</b>

For his experience with terraria, he is smoort

You download all items map for terraria.

Hey pewds, if you want a better picaxe i recommened the Reaver Shark. You obtain it by fishing in the ocean biome and you need the reinforce fishing pole and enchanted nightcrawlers.

Everybody gansta &#39;til the eye goes underground.

<a href="">6:05</a>

Bruh he got meteorite on 3rd episode.  I didn&#39;t get meteorite until I got to mid-hardmode.. .-.

<a href="">21:17</a> the dark side of the force is strong with this one.

Slimes raining from the sky Me knowing what&#39;s gonna happen

It's very cute how he thinks this is all that can be done.
Pewdiepiiiiiieeeee soo you gonna KIL SVEN HUH THE RABBITS AR SVEN

<a href="">9:40</a> It&#39;s A Sandstorm Or Something Else

I love how he just says: “O Lord” in hell

That meteor.

I never know PewDiePie plays terraria
I want to see how he does in master mode

The space gun is good

Me takes forever to find magic mirriorFelix:finds enchanted sword in 3 episodes

&quot;Screams are echoing around you&quot;Felix: <b>EPIC</b>

Pewds you have a lot more to being a pro than you think, Have you defeated the mechs yet?

“What is hurting me all the time!?”You’re in terraria now. 😂If you don’t want hurt, you should’ve clocked out at the title screen.

Now just play Master Mode...

Thomas the train lmao.

Anyone else notice he passed the sleeping fisherman?

What’s wrong with Felix is he thinks that terraria is like Minecraft. So he goes into bosses unprepared then he’ll probably die one day

Just the way PewDiePie commentates  and talks makes his content so much better

you need atleast 200 health for any boss its luck that you defeated the eye of cthulu

Pewdiepie: realizes he can get better helmet “I already have a helmet though”Terraria veterans: 😐

Like me please

I can&#39;t believe pewdiepie found a shrine

There was a water bolt right there! In the entrance!

That feeling when you stumble upon the enchanted sword and be like &quot;W0t?&quot;

I really want to join and teach pewdipie.😀😀😀😀

Nice meme&#39;s and sounds though 😀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
PewDiePie theres a water bolt and dont go any further when it says underground you must run 🏃🏃🏃😲

I&#39;m surprised he could go that far down there. xD

😂😂😂😂

STRESS LEVEL- I HAVE DASHED TO COMMENTS WHEN HE STARTED GOING DOWN TO DUNGEON
Omg you got the zelda sword its very rare

I was just waiting for the super dash at the end of the boss fight, but pews wasn&#39;t at expert mode sadly

Get some 👓

i bought minecraft and know i want to buy terraria but my parents wont let me xD xD

You&#39;re literally not prepared for boss battlea huh?

This game is best with friends

Bro there’s penguins <b>*casually chops it in half*</b>  ......that’s so cool

Pain

Pewds: I don&#39;t need light to see in the darkMe: I can&#39;t see what you are doing place torches please

Him going down in the dungeon was the best part of the livestream Bc 80% of people were spamming “NONONO STOOOOOP STOP” and 20% didn’t know why the hell people were freaking out

block meteorite , got in random World? Sorry bad english?
the dungeon guardian be like. UUUKAHAA
Sometimes I think &quot;Wow, he&#39;s actually heaps good at this&quot; And then I remember he&#39;s not being forced to play in expert mode T-T

<a href="">2:46</a> Don? That you?

When you get good enough defeat the moon lord for a spell, it will allow you to fly and act like a mining helmet.

There were no creepers in Terraria. Therefore, Pewds has become the creeper.

me: Goes down the dungeonPewds: goes down the dungeonBoth: die from &quot;skeleton guard&quot;Also Both: get jumpscared.

You should go mining more

Things that you can’t mine you should explode with dynamite

I didnt think it was pokimans! I thought it was penis

Imagine felix vs skeletron
Wow! PewDiePie is learning his first Pie pro sword C:
this video pewdiepie is so lucky he found a enchanted sword woooow

I was waiting for arkhalis

Been playing for a month still haven’t found enchanted sword

Pewds: WhY dId YoU nOt TeLl mE ??Chat: NoOoOoOo DoN&#39;t gO

I&#39;s anyone scrolling down through the comments to find the person that mentioned that his camera went out for the rest of the video?

Hi pews, I&#39;m building a social media site and think you could help. Its what you have talked about. Let me know. Thanks

Pewds before he meets the terrablade

Anyone else hate it when he plays of camera?

My parents are going to divorce but watching you makes me feel better so thank you if you see this witch you wont

I don&#39;t understand what happenedWhy is the title so dramatic if nothing happened-

How has this man got an enchanted sword 🤣🤣

haha imagine getting corruption in your world--this post was made by the crimson gang

Someone should tell him that the corruption or crimson spread in hardmode

bruh i looked for an enchanted sword for hours and he found it by accident his map is so fkin lucky

When Pewdiepie plays minecraft frick frick frick when pewdiepie plays terraria $#!*    ****#!#!*#*!$

<a href="">14:36</a>Bye!!!Bye bye!!

They said don&#39;t freaking go pewds

Felix <b>Accidentally finds The Master Sword</b>Also Felix: W o T ! ?

Pewds: (kills eye of Cthulhu without platforms with a chain knifeAlso pewds: (dies to king slime)

he&#39;s so happy for getting an enchanted sword (which is usually bad luck terraria veterans in the comments)imagine how happy he would be if that was an arkalis

I&#39;m not one to watch streamers but if you&#39;re a long time watcher of pewds you&#39;ll love watching his stream which is in his description.

pewdiepie:*beats eater world with a meterorite armor and space gun*me with full set molten armor and a flame sword (I get it using reaver shark):excuse me.WHAT THE FUCK!

Next episode on, Pewds the idiot: he’s finally 1% done with the game! Buuuttt... he tries to defeat the wall it flesh! Like an idiot! Hello person scrolling through the comments

People when pewds played minecraft: what the F is the seed?Meanwhile pewds in terraria: im not even gonna complain about it

When you get a blood moon, slime rain and meteorite and kill the eye of chufulu and the eater of world&#39;s in the same video

I didn’t realise how much I wanted a boss fight with the Eater of Worlds with the Thomas the Tank Engine theme until I heard it for a split second

<a href="">14:35</a><b>It was at this moment that he knew..</b><b>He fucked up</b>

Wow, forgot how easy Eye of Cthulhu is on classic.

<a href="">8:09</a> says jesus lord in hell
Life becomes a lot easier once you have Paladin’s Hammer.

<a href="">24:11</a> is this one of the <b>&quot;why do I hear boss music?&quot;</b> situations?

The space guns noise is SO annoying!

<a href="">14:25</a>a smile just slowly came on my face

dREAM its time for another seed search

how does he respawn with all his equipment???

<a href="">14:43</a> the dungeon guardian

Most likely pewdiepie&#39;s mind: man I should just go back to minecraft. Im way better at that.

<a href="">14:23</a>

Pewdiepie: zombie armAlso Pewdiepie: where did I get that from?

That thing can become a pet it is almost impossible to get though

Pewdiepie: goes to hell and finds dungeon instantly Me: HOW THE <b>**</b> THAT TOOK ME 3 DAYS TO FIND AND I KNOW WHAT IM DOING

Oof

<a href="">24:47</a> I think that was based off of Centipede

Did he not notice the ancient sword shrine entrance?

Why are there so many zombies doesn’t know that we goblins

Damn, you got so much good stuff so fast. HOW DO YOU ALWAYS GET GOOD WORLDS WTF!

I wanna see Felix reaction to expert eye of cathulu

Pewds: holds with his spider web to not have fall dmgMe: laughs in my umbrella

Is anyone else that stage where they one tap the eye

I love how PEWDIEPIE has played like 10 years less terreria than me but he is so much better than me

pewdiepie is lowkey dwight shrute
Ah yes the jungle bat frustration that every terrarian has gone through

<a href="">1:02</a> enchanted sword

AWUAWUA YO NO HABLO INGLES Y NO ENTIENDO NADA

I love how he doesn’t release you you do stuff straight from the inventory

Pewdienoob Ok no
I subed to you and l told my  friends to sub to you and they did

Not to brag I’ve bettin the flesh dude 6 times my character is full chlorophyte

Me desperately waiting for days to get a slime rain Felix finds 3rd day

I have killed the dungeon guardian because it got gliched(:

It almost makes me mad, because of the fact that he doesn’t realize how lucky he is 😂😂😂

Goes into dungeonMe: dude I can’t wait to see his reaction when the dungeon guardian smites him

I hope covid 19 is gone

Pewdiepie: <b>goes to Dungeon</b>       <b>to be continued</b>

Ngl but u r actually alright at this

Ive literally never got that... ;-;

He didnt just get the enchanted sword...

There was a water bolt in front of the dungeon

<a href="">4:35</a> thats what she said

I&#39;ve never found the enchanted sword and I&#39;ve been playing for 4 years 😂

<a href="">3:38</a> Why is he so lucky??

Dessert lands then right next to snow lands??? My brain get big hurt

<a href="">3:50</a> we shouldn&#39;t tell him about terra blade<a href="">5:23</a> and about Brothers... At least eye of chtulhu in master

the dungeon master is summoned at night

The principle is : the longer you stay outdoors, the more hordes of monster will try to kill you

Whats your seed pls

Whats your seed pls

when terraria has a dead end.....me: terraria has a very small world ?!

I want to tell this to some gamers but they think its soo boring and my classmates told me to stop playing terraria

How can he kill 2 bosses and attemp to kill another bosse in one episode

The demon throwing purple scythes if u kill him u get the scythe

Do the eater of worlds

Pewd : <b>runs past angler</b>Me : <b>screams in agony</b>

&quot;When you think this game cant get any weirder it does&quot;Just wait till he gets the fishing tools lol

It’s really annoying me how he didn’t get that water bolt at the top of the dungeon

So... we&#39;re just gonna ignore the fact that he easily destroyed the EoW as a first - time Terrarian with no arena.

there&#39;s an ocean at the end of your terraria world

The terraria and minecraft lords blessed him so much that he always found rare items

I saw a walking goldfish in terraria and I haven’t finished this series so I hope he finds one and keeps it

Me: u failed king slimeFelix: so whatMe: bruh

I wish I was as lucky as pewds.

Everyone telling felix not to go down there...Felix: <b>dies</b>Also felix: WhY DiD YOu NoT TELL Mee!!!

bro my world has 5 corruptions and no living trees and he got an enchanted sword

...every beginners fate.....

<b>who puts a hole In their house</b> literally every time I play with my brother

Hey your not strong enough

MEGA YOYO!!!!!

<a href="">12:19</a>

Get a pet bunny

<a href="">15:36</a> Dig Dug ultimate

Literally left a water bolt at the dungeon smh

Hello comments I&#39;m from the future the journey end&#39;s is released

Why everyone is writing about the enchanted sword?

You should defeat the giant skeleton

did he just ignore the waterbolt?

is this a jojo refrence

Felix use the snow wood it can make cool furniture

Didn&#39;t anyone find it irritating that Pewds is using his mining helmet for combat?

Did pewds just walk past the water bolt at <a href="">13:52</a>

<a href="">14:35</a> that made me stop playing Terraria

<a href="">17:04</a> idk why but the sound effects killed me lmafooo

I am watching this when 1.4 came out on p.c so I am triggered how he got an I still don’t have it for zenith

WHAT THE HELL WHY ARE YOu SO LUCKY

Btw the &quot;Spooky Biome You said is called corruption its evil and it invades your world it cannot corrupt the hallow but it can corrupt other bioms.

Pew die pie i want to tell you that NPC&#39;s Have their own housing it requiires a chair,walls,a table,and a light source

chest = wimpy safe :)

After reading all the comments i guess the Enchanted Sword is pretty rare. idk i have like 4 hours into Terraria and i found it on my 3rd world

WAIT TILL PEWDS ACCIDENTALLY BREAKS A BULB WHILE HE’S IN THE UNDERGROUND JUNGLE
He missed a water bolt at the entrance to his dungeon, this video is making me so fuming since I never get world gem this good

Aah. Terraria. My childhood game

Me: &quot;omygosh he already found a shrine? If he doesn&#39;t get Arkh-&quot;Pewdiepie: <b>gets enchanted sword</b>Me: GodWhat have you done to this poor man

Me (Old terrarian) seeing the Enchanted sword :How lucky..

WHAT      WHAT       WHAT       WHAT

and did u know that there is a myth that demonite protects from ghosts?

and why did u use jackscepticeyes logo when u sayed &quot;are we behind the eye&quot;?

bruh why didint u notice that u got a rly rare thing accidently that some ytbers need hours to find

Pewds: Brah theres penguins! <b>Chops its head off</b>Pewds: Thats so cool!

Aww I miss this game, I&#39;ve quitted playing this since 2017 I think, I don&#39;t know how to play this rn

DONT GK DOWN!

IOVE

I love how insanely lucky pewds gets in certain video games.

Remember in the beginning of the series when pewds said zero deaths it&#39;s changed a lot already.

Dam Felix is so much more adventurous and brave in games then I am.

He had more luck than me, so sucks &gt;:(

even i cant find an enchanted sword for my Zenith yet in 1.4

there was litterally a water bolt above the door into the dungeon..

I know Cthullu from Lovecraft, when they said &quot;The Eye of Cthullu&quot; I imagined some really creepy and demonic stuff with floating darkness and a lot of tentacles coming out. And it&#39;s just a floating regular eye ball LMAOOO

This video somehow recommended in my list🤔🤔🤔u 2?

Felix: It&#39;s a slime, it can&#39;t hurt meKing Slime: Am I a joke to you?

Pewds: kills eye of cthulu   Also pewds: <b>gets killed by king slime</b>

Kinda worried about IKEA Hotel cuz if he plays the 1.4 update, there will be no more IKEA Hotel becuz of the NPC Happiness system. :(

Terraria: screens echo around youFelix: coolMe: lmao it would be funny if he destroyed all the orbs

More terraria

But cool you got a light saber
WHY DID YOU WE SAID NO.

OMG ThAT IS A SKELETON HEAD...!!!

You cant mine obsidian while you have low class pickaxe

More terraia

this series has such Adventure Time vibes

So many players must’ve been triggered when Felix was one orb away from the Eater of Worlds.Less triggered when he had the piercing space gun though.

the fact he isn&#39;t playing in expert mode triggers me

How cool would it have been if he had gotten the arkhallis

I love terraria

Looser pewdiepie
pewdiepie
The gun sounds like cha cha real smooth
He killed a bunny

everyone:veteranme:vegeterian???
He’s such a noob

I hate the mining helmet just because it doesnt give good armor and gives a small light like i just use a light pet

He didn&#39;t notice the water bolt outside the dungeon

Felix: kills eye of chuthu Also felix: almost dies to zombies

im surprised he was able to kill the eye with a sword

I like how excited he gets over snow. Just wait until he gets into hard mode and finds the hallow. :)

Pixelings 😃

Good Job king slime&gt;=) REVENGE!!!

Bruuu the ooddx s are with him <a href="">3:40</a>

Looking at how little damage the eater of worlds does makes me remember the good old days of normal mode

Felix: <b>defeats eoc with an enchanted sword</b>Me, a veteran, having beginning hardmode weapons, literally running from a frickin&#39; unicorn: <b>that thing is literally gonna devour my soul</b>

Me:trolling pewds Me:relized that im not a veteran Me: ... Me:deletes comment*

The enchanted sword

The way he said, &quot;Why did you not tell me?&quot; is just amazing.

When pewdiepie kills the eye of cuthulu but cannot defeat the king slime : bruv ._.

Pewds: Everyone is saying no don&#39;t go down thereAlso Pewds: WHY DIDN&quot;T ANYONE TELL MEEEEEEE

Why did Felix&#39;s facecam turn off later in the video

Fun fact Terraria is finite not infinite there is an end its just really really really far away.

I dunno why but how do pewdiepie gets almost all rare things. I played terraria a year ago and cant even find a pink slime

I just relized that his user name is peepee

<a href="">18:33</a> pewds:hey squirrel squirrel: <b>nervous sweating</b>

Could you imagine if he got Arkhalis first time at <a href="">3:41</a>

Imagine he got Arkalis

i know this is the wrong time but Pewdiepie you should have gone fishing for the reaver shark to get obsidan to mine the metorite like if u agree

Imagine if he was in expert mode 😂😂

I just realized from watching this how overprepared for the eye I was I had meteor gear and the minishark and a whole arena when I fought the eye

ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh press CTRL when mining :O

I Miss Pewd&#39;s playing this game 😢

Chat: dont do itPewds: diesAlso pewds:WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME!!!
