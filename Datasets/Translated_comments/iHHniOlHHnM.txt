I don&#39;t understand why they act like as They are here all because of us 💀

All these motherfucking actors consider themselves God and they don't care.
What was the matter Salman discussing there with jacckyy

the only person who handled the media question with dignity and  respect was ranbir kapoor , rest all behave as if they are  angles fallen from heaven and they are god and too big to be asked such silly questions. and rani was the worst she didnt even have the humbleness to listen to the question and was just trying to avoid answering question which was so relevant seeing that actresses were just a show peace in movies which the media guy politely refered to as achar , one side ingredient  in a thali of films and she could have answered by saying that  she is trying to make a difference in this industry but she choose to humiliate  the media guy  , shame on rani and kajol both sisters are good at manipulating answers and  avoid the real  question. i guess what these actors dont realize is that they are insulting the  very people  who are responsible for putting  roti on their table . I am sure they must have learnt their lessons after pandemic what  a public is capable of ,off course their are exceptions like ranbeer , joh ebrahim  etcc... and today thanks to youtube that even a common man has become celebrity which is a big threat to the career of such arrogant celebrities

MR SUMIT FOREVER STAYS IN OUR HEARTS 😂😂

The bloody media is so damn annoying, Why do they ask such silly and dumb questions???!!!

Priyanka Chopra voice is amazing ❤

Can anyone say anything to Salu?
Abhishek just has one leg of his father and other of wife.He doesn&#39;t know acting at all.😊

Well Muhammad kissed Aisha.
If any reporter has read my comment then brother please have a request, please share it with Jaya once.
Pc did nicely cover it though...Bcz everyone knows what&#39;s happening b/w her n sharukh...

BAN ALL ACTORS WHO DON&#39;T RESPECT THE AUDIENCE. If they are just actors, let them act in movies and stay at home; do not participate in public shows. Audience treats them as demi-Gods, but in return, actors are slapping their fans without any empathy. Ridiculous!

Could someone explain the context and what was spoken in the second clip with the lady and Deepika and Arjun?

Priyanka Chopra ❤
Sabzi khaney wale log ka baat hee aisa hota hai

Eh

tu yi show biz mai kion hain if they want to be private  shhhh so arrogant

Godi Media ☕
Sharukhs keep Deepika is also there...

I would say come on they are humans, they can&#39;t be sweet everytime. Media too should behave keeping privacy of people

The video should be called media&#39;s ugly fights with bollywood stars, because its the media that entices the fights, like salman said &#39;I&#39;ll say something, you&#39;ll understand something, someone else will add something and this small thing will become big, this is what the media does, the actors entertain us and the media spoil it all

These are the people India worships Shame!The rudest ones, are Shahrukh Khan,  Deepika, Rani Mukerji who very rudely kept on concentrating on Achaar and also named the reporter Achaar ...that was very silly. ..Finally of course, Miss Jaya  Badhari , she always thinks she&#39;s smarter than the world!!🙄Salman Khan was patient...ived up to his nameShahrukh Khan should do the same he is too sarcastic..🙄

the way by Abhishek helped SRK to roast Sumit was &quot;Bro Code&quot;🤣🤣🤣🤣

them purposely  bringing srk in priyanka&#39;s context is so cheap

Oh yes!! Not fair! First of all he was not being treated with respect when he comes for certain shows etc or any such thing, he is always moved to back seat by saying “ here other actors are to be seated” 🤷‍♀️ what the hell? HEK in the industry then? Poor guy never Do you know Abhishek has to put his foot down and be aggressive 😮Who is ABHISHEK then? Why isn’t he being given that importance?? Smarten up you people like farah mani karan johar etc!!!

what did the lady say to deepika and arjun that they got furious?

Priyanka did it right.

Rubbish.
Big Egos Small minds definition of a actor

BOLLYWOOD MEDIA IS SO CRINGE.. I NOTICED

I like Ranbir&#39;s response 😍👍🤟
This movie is not make in dubai, this moviei. Is bad movie they are greedy  to make much easy m oney on poor peoples in india.

media sucks in India. let the actors live peacefully

<a href="">12:57</a> 😂😂😅

In India, there&#39;s a prevailing perception that celebrities believe they possess everything, yet the truth is that it&#39;s the public who propels their popularity. In reality, they often function as puppets within an industry solely focused on financial gain. This contrasts with many other countries where actors don&#39;t adopt such an entitled attitude towards the public.

Thats y i hate those fool fukin media

What did the journey asked Deepika

Priayanka is just awesome ❤

dogs are hungry
PC love ❤️
What exactly was the question deepika was asked?

I don&#39;t have any sympathy for the stars, TBH.  They know what they are getting into.

Context about Deepika??

Pehele toh Yeh log media ke piche bhag reh ta hai ki usko cover kare lekin baad me media uske piche bhag te reh te hai aur wo log irritate bhi ho jate hai.. Without media wo log ke bare hum logo ko pata bhi nehi chelega

Salman said it very well but many nautankis and online trolls would go on with utter rubbish. Also I&#39;ve noticed that hindi journalists are the most rude bunch ever! Recently saw these rude jerks being rude to south indian actors too!

Srk Nail it 😂😂😂

This Randi market is this Mumbai film industry
Madarchod, this is the question of the press people, bring out those people who did not agree with you, what did your father do?
Salman rocked
Jaya Bachchan ji has a different swag. When you look at her, she looks stunning. How would Big B Sahab bear it?

Abhishek comic timing😂😂😂😂😂

Idiots all actors actresss here on this channal u r showing 😂😂😂😂

This is not UGLY FIGHT WITH MEDIA, this is STARS FIGHT WITH UGLY MEDIA...

Those who earn money by showing their body are seen by the public and their bread is spoiled and the question was raised, what are you doing by banning and what are you giving knowledge about.
Bollywood guys are no match for all the actors and actresses of South Indian films😆😆
Tukde tukde gang ki heroine aa gayi gala fadne!!

These Reporters have no self worth, the Bollywood people treat them like shit and yet they lick their shoes

SRK handles it well..

Jackie shorff looks taller and more in good shape than sallu

Bollywood now = drugs ka adda

Deepika dancing, showing shameless color pati dancing
last but not least. no. 10 Annabelle doll

Yeh indian paparazzi chutiya hai, they deserve it.

Almost all of the actors dealt with the media and took the situation really smoothly!

Aaise logo ki mandli khud ki lal karne wale......unproductive

Seeing Arjun Kapoor, my future dictated darkness to me.
How stupid is that reporter askin so stupid questions to srk

What a low life filmi journalists are? Asking stupid, senseless and provoking questions.

I didn’t like rani’s behaviour🙄 She was so mean to that reporter for no reason

Jaya has no sense
What exactly that lady asked to Dipika? Soubd is not cleeared ?

Achar nai banna hai to answer dona uska sidha. Achar toh hohi tum bollywood walo.

This country belongs to your father, what are you saying?
Sari pole khul gai bollywood vali ki

Media comments bad words and misleading information about them and when they react, records them in their camera just earn money through creating sensation. If they put camera on themselves, who will watch their videos...

Any sub? Don&#39;t know Indian. But I love drama. 😅😅😅

media deserves it lol
Fake people

<a href="">9:02</a>

These Bollywood actors are either arrogant or they are TRP driven.In both cases they are a shame to the society.

bhai main to bolti aise pagal pagal media ko cancel kro yaar kyunki ye be faaltu ka koi bhi sawaal puchte h aur batmizi bhi krte h

SRK needs to mend his ways.

Salman Bhai, what stand are you guys talking about??
Intane bede vivad ho gaye or main ab jake 2023mai dekh rahu hu ।
These people are so full of themselves. They are arrogant and so annoying at the same time. And when they talk, damn, so much more annoying. Please calm down. You are simply entertainers, nothing more.

what was the statement she made to deepika and arjun??? could&#39;nt make out what she was saying

This behaviour of Indian actors I don&#39;t like but  i like BTS, because they thought without their friends they are nothing. They don&#39;t insult their fans .

Media over smarting sometimes
<a href="">18:22</a> epic respect ++

Parineeti 😂😂😂😂

These many actors have come here because of the public.
<a href="">

I like the style of ua word saying GAYE hue te...!! Is sounds like GAY hote h...!! 😅

Dude Indian journalists are just something else.The level of audacity and entitlement they have is astronomical

There shud be a law where actors can file case for verbal defamation or something likethat especially on media. And for their unrelated questions how stupid are these people

Salman khan right.... Kuch kehenge kuch uthalenge fir kuch likhenge .... Sharukh Khan... Kabhi jhagda nhi karte bas media jeise bolta o aise ans dete haiDeepika Padukone... Ko jeise dabal pucha o thik nhi tha

Bollywood actress says that her curse will come on her father...
Can someone translate what the first reporter said?

No matter what kind of actor Arjun Kapoor is, he is a gentleman. He really comforted Deepika and took a stand for her

What answer has Salman given this year💯🔥🙌
Why media always take advantage of our fundamental right of Freedom Of Expression

What did the media say to Deepika in the 2nd clip? The world is no more
what was the deepika padukone thing i didnt undersatdn

Bollywood Actors UGLY FIGHTS with Media | Deepika Padukone, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan &amp; Others

Deepika ko vo journalist kya hai rhi hai hai nii dera anybody plz tell me
Deepika Padukone was right. Anger justified

What was question for deepika..?

So I told you that my friend has come.
Jaya looks like gabbar singh
There was a salmon on the spot...someone's uncle, someone's daddu.
Corona and boycott have shown the real extent of this so called celebrity... I am asking for blessings please watch the video of us...
What is the problem in kaafi achhi ???I did not get it

Jaya is best 😂😂😂😂😂
Rani&#39;s answer was crap

Salman became Kartik Aaryan and delivered a monologue

Celebrities behave arrogantly when they are asked questionsThen they get desperate when no one watches their movies

These so called actors and actresses are full of themselves! And Indian people still worship them because they are rich and have a wealthy lifestyle however do not contribute to the Indian economy tackling poverty or buidling charities but are selfish. There are educated and uneducated people in India but then it is fate too! The rich are rich and the poor are poor!!!! I would not give them my attention in a lifetime because that is what they want fame! attention! I have seen youtubers who are British or European who help the Indian poor people more than these so called rich people! They are rude and disrespectful because shows that they are people &#39;&#39;just like us&#39;&#39; but with more fame and money!

Thank you social media that at least we have brought the truth of all these scoundrels to the public, how they bark and bite, the rest of the media too, don't show it, no one wants to see these examples.
media vale bhaht gandee log he jo huva ho vo or jo gujar gayi vo baat bhi , puchte he 😢

The media that even goes to the streets seems to be moving 😢 look at yourself.
Jaya is right but people think she gets mad at media for no reason but its always for a reason

Salman Khan is awesome to handle 😀😀😍😍😘😍😘😍😘😍
What was the fight about in deepika and the reporter lady clip??

Seriously ❤

Jaya my favorite 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What was the question to deepika in second video?

But even journalists do not see poverty, bakeries, inflation, livelihood, slums, and they run after those who insult and kick them... Only TRP?
Many people in India are worshiping false Hindu God created by humans. This is why many people have various types of demonic evil spirits like hatred, jealousy, ego etc. People in India should read the Hindi Holy Bible and accept the spirit of Lord Yeshua into their hearts, so that God can lift them up and make them like a star. , and the Spirit of Lord Yeshua can save, heal and help them in their time of need.
media khud pagalo wale sawal kr rhe h

Tumse ache Movies to tollywood waale banate hai. Such worst time for Bollywood that they don&#39;t have time to change there thinking.

subtitles would be great.

Bhosdi ke gandu dubai bund den gaye c. Sale fukkry nashedi hai sbhi ke sbhi. Thodi maa di fuddi bollywood waleo. Tusi ta khatm aa. South is the best and all the artist are very good.

Y suddenly Bollywood fights ???? What happened???

Maybe he was thinking you can celebrate in idia instead of going Dubai Indians will enjoy to see you all ...

Media reporters go to personal they said right as well...💗

attitude.. Dekon yar... Chee
The actual shit Priyanka just nail it she is like one of the savage

Salman khan best yaar😂
Media, no matter what country, is classless. Don’t make the actors look bad in these videos, laugh at the “reporters” and “journalists” asking stupid questions and acting like they own the place.

UAE 🔥🔥🔥
<a href="">2:25</a>

Media kutte ki doom hote hai.

I&#39;m Arab from Yemen, wish I could understand Hindi 😢❤

Can yall make this with english lyrics.

Srk.. these celebrations seem to be the attitude these people are showing to the public like a fool… from the perspective of the normal public, these celebratory activities look like a languid thing. Inka chuttiya sala SRK.
The media only wants to drink, but it is a mistake…..
I started to think that the media is nothing but an annoying stuff!

The man in the blue shirt is right to say, My driver will drive the car, he will praise you, you will feel that I am pushing you on the footpath.. this does not happen brother.
Who do media want to go into these actor&#39;s asses? Like, ask like they are working people bro, not like some culprits waiting to be questioned.

Salman kiss Jacqueline so sweet ❤❤
😂😂😂

<a href="">13:02</a>😂😂😂😂

Sk srk are the best

Abhishek bacchan 😂

a really handsome man,,

Dirty media, nice that celebs give befitting reply

Useless log
Rani mukerji ka kafi funny scene tha😂

Rani kills it ... achaar vale vichaar
seriously .. these guys can call bad names to Indians for being an Indian then turn around and say &quot;omg journalists are very mean&quot; the Nepotism bandwagon Khans and lickass of Dubai.. threatning and over reacting. Only Shahid Kapoor has the guts and clarity to aknowledge nepo issue  Celebs have crossed all lies of decency - not with Dharma not with Bhaarat not even a basic human who does NOT treat people on streets as &quot;garbage&quot; Audiences have forgotten these murder nd Dubai human trafficking incidents?? Sexy Radha and Flirt fraud Krishna is Ok nothing disturbing and Raavan is a Hero.. lolzz..  G*<b>*</b> banadiya hai Hindus ka..

Ye chutiya log ko dekhney se  dussa lagta hai i really hate Bollywood movie

celebs are also human yrr. gussa to aayega hi agar bakwash questions puchoge wo bhi camera ke samne

Rani ne to bolti band kardi

Hahah

Reporters ask questions as if they were born from their moms ass

Rani mukharji 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ye sabh  ke sabh  harami  hain  Bollywood wale  dramebaz

Jaya bachan is a shit

🙏

These reporters deserve this bashing.

What question did the reporter ask Dipika Arjun that he did not understand?
<a href="">16:45</a> At first, you ask a disgusting question and then you say &quot;Aree yaar&quot; as if you&#39;re being annoyed. I mean how dare he say that actresses are achaar. Can he even act? Does he know how hard it is to act well? 😡

The woman who questioned Abhishek should be fired from her job. Didn&#39;t she learn manners at school? What did she do all this while during her childhood? Eating grass? 😡😡😡

Average Indian journalism 😂
But somehow jaya bachan’s attitude is perfect. For the media  and i think she is just staright forward and not rude

Salman talks more to Shahrukh
Don&#39;t mass with srk ☠️☠️☠️
Idiot question and idiot you 💩💩💩💩
Deepika ko kya pucha tha journalist ne

Always show the questioners face also,then they won&#39;t ask idiotic questions

I bet this channel has never seen real ugly fights.

bhai phele khud kuch bhi bolte he or bollywood ko bura bolte he

Shahrukh is doing this again as if he is doing a favor by respecting the reporters, he also does his bit.
Hindi film industry is the weakest right now, if we want to increase our market share again then we will have to bring in original scriptwriters, now after the lockdown people will understand who wrote the original scripts and who wrote the remake scripts, they will write this Ghatiya film but make it. Now make the original, you will soon find yourself in the bahar lote of Varna Film City, and you will be able to ask for money even after selling a taali.
Where do these people come from, why do they do this, who kills them, do they go through any kind of trouble to earn money, the conscience of these people, humanity is all dead.
Why is that guy upset that people are going to dubai does he have any business which is affecting him 🤔

Jaya Bachchan born to make every interaction ugly !!

I won’t ever see any of these peoples movies.

Priyanka slayed mannn
Koch has also asked questions on his blog.
I agree with salman

Arjun bhaiya , jitna attitude isme haina aapka , usi level ke expression movies me Diya Karo . We would love to see .

Jaya bacchan is soooooo much arrogant

Brother who broke up with SRK, he is really drunk, I don't know myself, what is he asking or what is he asking?
<a href="">14:31</a> no but that&#39;s really mean of her for saying that to parineeti

Modi ji should come to such a press conference.
Why are you going to Dubai? It's such a bad question, what is your money?
U can mess with anybody but never srk..bap ke sat mat khelna

Media is motherchod

These fellows goto dubai and do gangbang for days

Abi sharukh khan wanted to win the election of 2024, the prime minister said that the result would have been good.
The biggest attitude he has towards women is in my eyes. What is he so proud of? Are you a superstar of India? No one eats this much, madam. You have made yourself a star, no one knows who has made you a star, so you have to keep this attitude. I saw you live, that's why I said it. Whose meaning will you fall into this niche?

These people don&#39;t have a conscience they got lots of money they don&#39;t need anymore poor Hindus made them rich showing us disrespect

This media is of no use. There is nothing to increase TRP.

The artist should only be asked about his art, not about his personal life.
If we look at the language, none of them know Hindi or English well, that is why they use the language in a slangy manner, these are the children of the convent.
Are these reporters retarded?

Why boycot this is reason

Queen, you are a very bastard. Di
How many doubts are there?
Salman got the ball from Ranaldo
Bring the bone to you
Priyanka is very positive person

Indian media are  ugly

Good questions
This wisdom has come out of the house to make it known to the media and the public. Ehh ajj ka bat nahi job se media aya se tab se
Are you crazy when you make a film in Hindi, do it in Hindi?
Hopeless media.. Focus on the national issues not to these bloody useless celebrities...

It&#39;s not ugly fight, mostly they are responding the way it should be. Just put yourself in their shoe and you will realise that some questions doesn&#39;t relate and you may too lose balance

It is necessary to boycott such people and it is necessary to give them equal importance, because the people have brought them to this place, they do not deserve their respect. A beggar will beg for sale on the road.
Priyanka is the best in handling media. She is very smart with her answers. Without getting frustrated she hit it back with  a smile and sensible answers.

When your annoying relatives ask about your grades during a family function Me: <a href="">18:34</a>

Indian media are 😔 terrible...i would have behaved in a more terrible way ... celebrities have  lot of patience

Thank you Sunu Ji

SRK isnt very easy to be offended by the media 😂

The bully media sometimes forget their limits u have to right to ask questions only related to the movies only no personal or no taunts Indian media 😂😂😂😂😂

These movies, TV serials, actresses, actors and cricketers, these leaders warn everyone. I don't show any attitude to the public otherwise everyone will fall from the sky to the world.
Bro salman in the first but tho the way he was like I will not sponsor your channel and kept saying mommy

Yaar woh dubai ja rahe hai toh kya hoya

YE HAKHLA SHAHRUKH KITNI JALDI BHADAK JATA HAI.

<a href="">#BoycottPatthan</a>

Raani behaviour not good chhhiiiii
What&#39;s the matter with Deepika???

Reporters should be jailed.
These people are talking about India by going to Dubai.
Indian Media is so so stupid.... low minded people

Media

Ye press wale in actoroko itna bhav kyu dete hai yar pta nhi..

SRK- This meeting is your father's, so ask the question Reporter- No, it is your father's and your father is the main one 😡😡😡😡
Infact media can ask good question. Unessarry, irrevelwnt question not good for them to ask... Ethics required for some reporter...

Media are headache

Arjun Kapoor also overacted 💀
Title should be Chutiya media

Parineeti has the stinkiest armpits in whole Bollywood.

Hahaha..  Change titals..

Media deserving...😌😝😝
Sometimes media wale dew p k aa jate h shyd ...itna b toofani sahi nai
Go.i.
Media shouldn&#39;t mess with Indian actors and actresses

Na    kar

Srk not fighting he reply with swag aur uski bejjati bhi😄😅

When one becomes famous they also lose their freedom

What she said to Deepika??

Dipika always cried like she used to make me.
this type of journalism is also required to know whether they deserve to be a public figure or not. If they want that position they have to go through the googly public throw at them and handle it in a proper way.

btw what was the reporters que to which deepika got angry

Very nice comments
Parson Right OR Rong Questions RightTimeThat !!! (A, T. Z;)

Dnt wanna see this fat kid fed up of him trying to stay relevant except from being relevant in movie beside being an actor this son of boney kapoor. Why is he even in movie industry this doesn&#39;t make even sense

SSR

Sir, after seeing what was happening, I found out that he was drunk and then I wouldn't have talked to him if Salman Khan had killed me.

What the hell is going on with the reporter keep asking srk srk with priyanka. Srk only having affairs with juhi chawla since 90s until now they are still lover, there is nothing between srk priyanka. Yes priyanka did tried to seduced srk but srk rejected her, that&#39;s why he stopped contacts with priyanka. Srk already having affairs with juhi since 90s he has no time for other woman. Srk juhi true love, soon srk will marry juhi.

Even the rich people run away from the media, they have also watched the videos of the poor people, that is why they listen to them.


Ya lokanchya yach vagnya mule industry bhik magayla lagli

I love Salman Khan for his honesty.

Shahrukh is very rude, why did he say such a thing, what is your father's problem?
Why am I talking about Salman Khan? His ass is getting fat in brother's name.

Oh god what a bad media India has 😳😡
Where did you say sir?
Abhishek is best

Bollywood ka the END RIP Bollywood

This is the best time to Destroy Bollywood movie Mafia ORGANIZATION FOREVER

Saruk is always the Biggest arsehole on stage

This is the best time to Destroy Bollywood movie Mafia ORGANIZATION FOREVER

This is the best time to DESTROY THIS BOLLYWOOD MOVIE MAFIA ORGANIZATION FOREVER

You, the media wala, are talking about you because of SRK or you are doing SRK tu-tu....this is how Bollywood creates the show.
King of bollywood Salman khan love

Pls can anyone tell what did the media say in Deepika wali clip???????
What these are.... Boycott Karo...don&#39;t interview them..they thrive on our money.

Media asks anything stupid in the motive of seeking opportunities for any controversy to happen.

&quot;Queen&quot; sunto lijiye 16.50...... bhai wah..!! She is your queen..
Seriously what the hell is going on..   media.    Such bullshit

The ass of all the Bollywood stars jumps whenever someone tells the truth. I am of my father's age and still call myself a hottie and those people too are hotties who follow them. Which hottie bande follows?
Indian Media bullshit🐂💩 Media
You should answer for the questions gentle way. Remember Celebrity,  you become celebrity because of the normal people.You most of the hindi actors or actor speak like idiots. Salman is big fraud😄 Indians dont be stupid to run after this idiot Hindi actors, actor, etc.

Every journalist or indian media ask such stupid question so that celebrities can make controversy...nd they will get masalaHate krna hai to media ko kroo why to hate actors yrrrr.....star kid ko hate krte hooo they don&#39;t say media ki hrr jgh mere picheee aao  or agr wo achaaa rxm nhi dete then unme bhot attitude hai...blame media not celebrities

Women nowdays ask very controversial questionn......
Jackline is common sex selves of all muslim actors of bollywood

Media should also be sensible in what they ask...   They can&#39;t irritate someone or involve into others personal, just because they are celebs..

Questions Sahi kiya wese
Press media wale unki kaut ## jaisi haiBhav bhav bhav
Me p.m hota to ..ye ghamandi ..actress ko nanga nachavata
Indian media is so much Zaleel tareen media in all over the world

What was deepika being asked about?

They all are fake,hypocrite n material of plastic whether star or journalist.

Can anyone explain me about deepika and Arjun kapoor clip ? I didn&#39;t understand

<a href="">

This is the status of bollywood, these people are showing their status to everyone, they are telling people that this is a bitch and a bitch, this is a dog's whip.
With due respect Rani ji jbrjsti hai hai?? Kafi acha hai toh kafi acha hai hai toh bolega agar jbrdjst super say bhi upar hai toh super say bhi upar hai he toh bolega na

I hate almost all actors

Hey queen, have you understood yourself, I said a lot to you that I felt bad, you are forcing me to say something, I did not like your movie but still you said a lot, I had to speak on your face and made a movie. Tune in till the sun is shining and I will sleep at night.
Watch the films of these scoundrels, they are dead...a lot of charades have been sung.
Super Salman sir

Salman Khan💥💥💥
No matter how much you talk to Shahrukh saying 'you', he talks only according to 'you'.

These are all genuine faces whom we consider the heroes of our lives.
Most of them are not ugly fights correct your self

What question do you have?
You know what whoever are just saying that they had crossed lines let me tell you one <a href="">thing.in</a> Hollywood ara celebrities are annoyed at another level like people do not show any kind of certain gesture or respect toward them they insulted them on their face aur agar jaya bachhan woh bhuddi ki tarah behave karta na toh sadak par pahucha dete cause no one give a damn f<a href="">#ck</a>

Whats the fun in addressing a person as too. These bollywood uneducated actors are nothing but people with no class and small ego.

Bhosdi wale baat karo in Hindi mein na yaar English bate rahoge to madrachod ho jaaoge, everyone and anyone will not come to Hindi society, no one in English society will come to Hindi film what hour will they watch.

indian media think that by asking these senseless questions they will get more prints on social platform as well in newspapers,, instead of interfering in their prsnl life, focus on the main thing a journalist can do..

I Love Sharukh, Priyanka, Deepika Padukone Aamir Khan ❤️👍
Yes

These media people have all sold out, they don't know where they studied, they don't know what their real job is, they come on TV, they give even a few words, the meaning of media has become useless now.
Human beings mindset really interesting why because before name and fame down to earth after getting name and fame they do not talk their money talks .

What did that lady say to Dipika ?

SRK&#39;s and Priyanka&#39;s responses were the best 😂

Brother, he goes to Dubai because he can.

The media people do not understand themselves as their fathers and grandfathers have made them stars. They will first ask crazy questions to the stars and if the stars get angry then they will troll them.
What is &quot;Ajjar&quot;. rani Mukherjee said kafi for 3 time why can someone explain to me in English

Madarchod media has been banned, it will never discuss real issues!
Jaya bacchan has one job to do in her life always shouting at her home workers or on media she is always like that lmao

There is a reason why Priyanka is so successfull and reached hollywood, and ruling over there. The reason is seen here, her smartness and intelligence

Priyanka just bombed journalist by smile.

Parineeti and Priyanka (Chopra sister)... Are Savage... Thug life

Rani was so over acting

Wtf 😒
These are the dancers and singers whose fees are a bit high, but the public does not understand this. Let the actor be an actor, he is neither a hero nor can be.
First of all, reporter Jaan Bujh said that some angry person said the wrong thing and then used it to make videos of masala and earn money and defame the celebrity.
Attitude levelIt&#39;s not Farah...its fuckra 🤣

Salman Said very true but Buffalo (media people) ko kahan farak padtha hai.

Media bullshits going into others personnel

Yaar, the media wala should know that these people do not respect anyone. We say that actors/actresses are rude.
Indian media is useless...
When will SSR sir get justice?
Bollywood katam dad goodbye 👋😅😅
What was this fight between Deepika and Arjun about?... Since I have been watching this video after video, I couldn't even tell what the reporter said...
Now the egos of these nachanyas are burried 6 foot down by public.

Why u guys just put the thumbnail so improper ......I saw the entire vdo ......where I ve not found any actor or actress to fight with ....... whereas they were just telling it was not a question to ask for ......they indeed never fought

Srk abusing reporter&#39;s father is bad 😑😑

South Indian actors 💥🔥👌🏻
I dont know Hindi 😪
What was the question asked to deepika and arjun?????

Can someone please tell me what was the question asked to Deepika and arjun when she got so upset?

Can any reporter ask such questions to politicians???

Salman media people's ass. Mother of brothers not united
I have seen few Khattiya reporters who keep asking true drug and shitty questions.
kyu jate ho Dubai 😂😂😂

Which movie 🎬 of Shahrukh is A certificate

The media also limits ... Don&#39;t ask questions related to whatever function you are in

If the media is in a position to do something then they will say that they have wronged their people. The illiterate girl is not worth the nails of <a href="">log.Star</a>
Easy money only in film industry 90% of the crimes happen with inspiration from film industry My opinion

Vo woman reporter Deepika ko kya bol rhi thi??? Does anyone know???

Frr

I really want to hear what was the second question asked to deepika and arjun....??

Salman bhai bolte rahe bolte rahe bolte rahe .....

@ <a href="">15:52</a>, I m neither a supporter of bollywood celebrities nor the reporters. But Yes media is very disrespectful towards Bollywood celebs at many times and they have full right to give savage replies to those rude reporters but the reporter who was asking question to Rani mukherjee was absolutely correct, may be his way of putting his question was wrong but his question was absolutely correct, and Rani mukherjee was just doing overacting and trying to show her oversmartness. Just ridiculous

I think meadia is such a dust bin...

look at his face
south is the best

Becoming a celebrity is not a bed of roses. 🙏

Kya faltu media pe gussa karti ho aap Deepika aunt they really waste your time aunt

Well media loves to question such stupid things bcz we look for such stupid queries.

actually no one fought from media except Rani Mukherjee and Salman Khan... and only ones Rani Mukherjee&#39;s behavior was not good.Otherwise all were answered well according to such stupid and frivolous questions.

Media Please Educate yourself and raise your level of questioning.How dumb can you guys get?

<a href="">5:01</a>  what salman is speaking about

There is a reason why they all go to Dubai

I like deepika&#39;s answer.... Camera ghumana jra udhr... Kyonki ye media wale camera k piche chupke bht bhonkte h... Good deepika 👏

What did the reporter questioned Deepika? I didn&#39;t understood that I was unable to hear it.

The most funniest part was when the girl from media said pyar atang nhi h then rabir reply bilkul aapka pyr scha h 👍

360 degree missing principal sir ji of nda ?

what was the reporter asking deepika to comment about?

I like it when Abhishekh told ...UAE

Abhishek  n PRIYANKA Chopra r mature n down to earth who gracefully handled all problems like  in movie FASHION &#39;a message.

Wow seriously such stupid questions and journalists, no wonder actors gets irritated because it seems no one is interested to actually talk about the movie or the work.

For all of them waiting for Priyanka&#39;s part <a href="">10:40</a> ✌🏻

These bastard actors have become very bad because of the media and then they abuse them.
Pariyana was smart in answering good job media fuken shit

No actors argued here . They just took a stand.

Jaya Bach took a very nice gift and did not accept it!
Media to taste question
Ugly media fights with actors

Who is Salman talking about in the press conference of Kick?

Buddha to hai sarukh dadu 👴
SRK is too harsh towards reporter

Priyanka has rocked it ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🤗😂😂👏👏👏👏
priyanka and rani  pull of legs of meida both of handal her this

Why do you go to Dubai?
Why do these media people talk without any sense? Does journalism teach all this? How can you hurt someone else's brain? its so obnoxious to learn about indian reports
Jacqueline Fernandez didn&#39;t understand a single word of what Salman said. She is just doing her job of looking sexy. That&#39;s it. 😂

Beta srk ask ur son about drugs
the actors need to respect the media also...it looks like when actors don&#39;t have answers they start to mock the media ppl. there was no need for srk and farah to get offended when the media person asked why they celebrate new year and similar festivities in Dubai and not India?

Indian actor and actress's interview in Hindi, I don't listen to it, Bollywood has banned the English language, it's good to Korean or China's actors who don't know their language.
Very well counselled .........

Aaa sala repotrs v fudu aa sala ena nu koi Pusha na aapp e sala repotrs kol an ga
Sharukh on the thumbnail is so funny i can&#39;t

This Bollywood guy is bald
Uneducated Media

Is this Farooq good or bad?
Indian audiences are so rude and disrespectful!

Bunch of Jokers

Salman himself is not able to answer even one question. Bigg Boss gives attention to the contestants.
Bina puche kiss jackeline ko

What was she saying to deepika?

I like the sense of humor of abhishek

Himmat nhi hai kisi ki underworld ke baare bolne ki bakwas h Bollywood

Jaya lagti hai do gut mark aayi hai
<a href="">18:34</a> Jb ap sy tinder pr koi poochy k ap single ho..... 🤣

All the actors will watch the destruction of the country if they stop in one day.
Devil will do good to Deepika padukone mam in front of me

Super

<a href="">19:55</a>She roasted rekha in different style 😂😂

Priyanka just nailed it!🔥🔥🔥🖤🇧🇩🖤
Media always try to get a ugly answer from them for a breaking news!☹️

SRK SIR WAS NOT ANGRY IT WAS HIS AMAZING HUMOUR

You should write caption like <b>MEDIA FIGHT WITH BOLLYWOOD STAR&#39;S</b>  instead of what you have written

Indian media is ridiculous

Sharuk Khan is very proud
Pure pagal neurotic actors..!! Inke picture dekh ke humlog bade huye hai.. So petty ppl

<a href="">9:00</a> Ladkiyo ko regression main vejne wale app ho..!!kya role rahta hai girls apke movie main..
Indian journalist are petty come on.

Abhishek nailed it with the 💯 club

<a href="">2:14</a> they look like enzo and elena together tvd fans will only know 🤣🤣

Pc and srk just nailed it ❤❤

First one was really drunk

Ugly questions by media

Dipika set** is sister...
Why is no one talking about Rani&#39;s reaction to the question on underworld. It was quiet evident how much of a impact underworld has on bollywood that she swiftly changed the topic and spoke over the person asking the question. If the system was active at that time and actually worked on cleaning out this so called Bollywood... We wouldn&#39;t have lost SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT!

Who’s this journalist ? Have heard him asking most silliest questions many times in each and every conference .. I have noticed because he has the most irritating voice .. can make anyone angry!

Shahrukh is so witty!!

Why Abhishek was so surprised, he was &amp; is such a bad actor, the only movie did well were the ones he appeared with big actors. Sometimes u just gotta tell your kid, &quot;Son I know u want to feed of my name but this isn&#39;t for you, find another career&quot; I hope jackie shroff says that to his son soon enough. I mean Crime patrol has WAY better actors than these 2 jokers.

Ugly bitter hearted arrogant zeros can only deliver bitterness and poison

Only few reporters are wise.remaining gave bribe to become journalist I feel

Achar?!

Srk savage 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂
Just because they are celebrities, you can&#39;t ask just any crap. They look desperate to troll them and least interested in actually knowing them.

Salman was cooking 😭
The way farah said sorry. She is cute.

Got ambushed with ak47 😂 no way escape 😂

Miss world is talented and she will have fantastic career.

Priyanka and abhishek were too good ....

Rani speak oh my god 😊
Can anyone please tell me Deepika ko reporter ne kiya bola because I couldn&#39;t understand anything

Deepika accent is rubbish

What are you talking about?
These journalists here are so completely out of line... So uncouth, and such absolute absence of civility.

Idk what salman was saying but I feel like I understand in a weird way but can’t explain what he said at the same time 😩

Priyanka ❤️
Deepika is mad

who cares

Jaya is unnecessarily arrogant and rude

Very good.these media people need to be given a slap

Bhai yeh Sumit bhai bade Ajeeb questions poochhte hai wtf is his problems 😭😖

Priyanka is thee bestttt...she knows what to speak...wonderful

REPORTER ASKING RIGHT QUESTION

Tere baap ka ..😂😂

The best moment was when selmon abruptly started calling every mami. Rofl

Why do you go to Dubai?
Media kam chutiya thore hi hai 😑

Priyanka Chopra is the besttttt

Hard to digest Parineeti talk about GYM when her hands look like fatty chicken legs.

Farha 🤣🤣I loved it
Being human is a big SCAM

Shahrukh to Aryan:- Whatever you have drunk, I am also having a lot of fun.
What happened with Deepika? Which incident are they talking about?

Salman maja agaya bhai...What kiss did you give..at night you will tap and tap.
If the media stops paying attention to them, everyone will be seen begging.
Sharukh ki gaand jal gyi

Innocence Personified Sobbing His Heart Out.

Mafia. Walking. 😡😡😡
That media is so so stupid ..the actors Are nailed it her charming faces

Hey friend, these media ask very bad questions.

What did the &quot;reporter&quot; ask Deepika?

no one has talked about abhishek he’s so amazing here

<a href="">14:07</a> Raj Niti Main has a very good dialogue which I would like to kill you 🙏🏻
Journalist may be good, but if you understand the language, he will stop answering what you say, if you don't know how to boycott, you are a false journalist.
SRK and PC nailed it.

Salman ate
<a href="">1:28</a> utna hi maza Aryan kr rha tha cruise party mei🤣

Useless guys.

Sare actor bhosdike

Media attacks deeps too much
Respect to them. Theyre justifying themselves. India media is fucked up

Apne aap  ko yeh  log kings and queens samģtte  hai  inn  ko sirr  par na  utavo

Priyanka&#39;s response is 👌👌👌👌 killing.. Waah nice answers with cute smile😎

If you translate into other languages, I think more people would follow. Thank you. 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Drugs lene jathe hai xdddd

&quot;Aachar ji&quot;🤣🤣🤣
SRK🔥😂💙
Shah Rukh should ask his son beta tu kya peeta h!

The actor will cry nonsense and will also get angry. He is also a human being.
Indian reporters really cross the line by not giving basic human respect to celebrities. Taking their good behaviour for granted.

priyanka answer mast mein kisi ke saath bhi yeh kar sakti hoon that&#39;s my Job. Sharukh buddha

Meri jungle billi 😁🤣🤣
Well,I love the sharukh&#39;s replies... He wasn&#39;t fighting with media like Rani was doing....rani mukherjee was unnecessarily arguing with media...I mean bhai use kaafi achi lgi hogi movie bhot achi nahi&quot; faaltu m usko cut kr rhi hai..... sharukh was literally having fun with media...nd joking around...nd about Jaya.... Jaya is such Rishi Kapoor of female....I know media is literally act bitchy nd vulgar sometimes....anyways.. I love srk! ⭐

<a href="">0:54</a> Yaha ni hota new year

@Media Mediaji, actors &amp; actresses are also human beings. Leave them alone.

Media people also commit mental rape 💆🤦
Deepika is so angry.

Jaya mam is like a strict yet polite teacher

SRK: Show ke baad joh tu peeke aaya hai, mujhko bhi pilanaJournalist: Are you taking the piss Sir?

<a href="">#Boycott</a> bollywood.

Jaya ma&#39;am is so sweet!🥺💕
<a href="">

Lol at 4.29 salmon bhoi trying to cringe touch on Jackline boops failed successfully , 😂😂😂

This is the attitude that Bollywood people have drowned in never showing attitude to the public.
Rani is superb🤣

Brother, ask some questions to the senior leaders who are watching the country like their brains, it is not your fault that they have distributed stars with their hard work.
I hate media
He is 55-60 years old. Still, their brothers-in-law think that they are 16-17 years old. you idiot, have some shame

<a href="">6:28</a> Be very fast 🤔🤔🤔
Salman picked a very logical topic here. And I appreciate it that he explained all the things from back to front and what&#39;s the affect of all these things to all the celebrities. The problems of the people&#39;s are to making the wrong, fake and weird images of all the celebrities. I appreciate to salman sir. 👍

I feel bad for pareneeti.....she is so cute.....nobody never troll her for her weight

<a href="">

<a href="">

I couldn&#39;t understand deepika&#39;s part

These reporters deserve this but jaya bacchan is really very dominant

Omg reporters!!! These actors never have the patience, but I can't figure out what to do?!!
