He cares about neighbours

😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠

What did Chunky Pandey do?
We have seen itana irrigation hota😢
He is right.

Ranbir got drunk
😂 real father

People must understand privacy!

Paparazzi bark like dogs they deserved to hear his this tone !

Miss you Rishi Kapoor ji

The way drunk Mr panday was  going to bang into him  was funny. He is right about the madia

Where did he said Tapad paray ga are you guys mad

CLICKBAIT

He is like a normal parent/uncle. He is acting like every body

He just wants to maintain the same aura and decoram ...just like Raj Kapoor ..but aajkal waise.log hain hi nhi ...waisa class wale.

<a href="">1:02</a> nice smile of rishi sir

Ye kare to gentleman and jaya bachchan same behave kare to sanki buddhi... Waah re dogli indian jannta😂

9 abhi

Rishiji i miss you and your manliness.

He is right whats wrong in that

Ekdum sahi bole the rishi sir,idhar dekho udhar ..

What is the meaning of all this 😐😐😐
What would have happened if Rishi Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan got married?
Rishiji was a straight forward person and he absolutely said it right

He is kind hearted person

Love you rishi sir🤗🥰
Sahi baat..bole...sone do...others ko kleef nahi honi honi haiye...well done.
Real royal son of raj kapoor.

Why the media channels take their photos and make them special,  what makes them do this madness,  why they don&#39;t think they are also ordinary people like them? Why when they talk, smile, act,  angry,  becomes a news, why not with others? Fools run after them.

why Indian reporters are so jungli😂😂😂?

Shor nhi ​​krna chaye...idr udr k log tang hoty hn
These photographers need such treatment..very good Late Rishi Kapoor.

He is right, how much attention should you pay to your neighbors?
He was from a descent and disciplined family. The world today is full full junglees who have no edicate and manners nor descent family background,

Itna daant khane ke baad aur phir pyaar se smjhane ke baad bhi jese hi Rishi sir sat in the car they are like alia lia lia lia lia ranbir anbir anbir  anbir side me side me side me idar idar idar idar left me right me jahannum me bc …. Macchi bechte the kya pichle janam me ye log uffff 🤣

nothing wrong was said
Just like a little girl, you have given up on your mother and father's secrets, you have just sold them to my father...my father has taken care of his inheritance, now he has sold my inheritance.
Thumbnail😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Shikha
Disiplend person good

Responsible citizen
Rishi kapoor ji rightly said that one should not think about one's neighbors also.
I said that I would like to stay in the main discipline.
Jaya parda and rishi kapoor are same
Why is this so much, everyone is mad after watching a movie, what is this, what is this?
Risi sir ki
Right baat h
Media is not anyone's right
Luved it sir!

They are deliberately tarnishing the image of Rishi sir after his departure. Or is Neetu ji being more active and happy after her departure?
This lesson was given to the media people.
This is the truth in Rishiji. I miss him😢😢🙏. Son it's a great loss
He is absolutely right

Really rishi sir was very genuine person

What he is saying is right.

Ye bht achhe hai lekin Inka itna mijaz khrab isliye hogya tha bimari se bht achhe actor the bus bimari se chid chid chide hogye the

Very honest logon ka bhi kheyal hy ky log so rhy hein . great sir

Nice couple ❤️❤️Aaliya and Ranbir Kapoor
Yes what he said is right

The bitter people have started coming together. Has the fear of Modi ji entered the bitter people? Akshay and Ajay Dev, the father of Bollywood, everyone else is in lull.
Banda Suru SE hi Star ⭐🌟 hain Rishi sir is the Best 🤗 will always remain in SAB ke Dilo ❤️ 🙏🙏🙏
No wrong in it.

There is a lot of shouting and shouting, don't make noise.
Hey rishi kapoor is right......cz there many times heared that their neighbours complained them for noises!!!! So rishi kapoor stand for them saying &quot;lokk so rahehe yha pae shorr matt machaw&quot; trying for them stand from them i hope absolutely correct and strict dissicion

It is equal, friend, these people are also human beings and live on this earth. If you always harass them and do not let them live their normal life, then they will definitely get angry. You keep following them. Don't let me go anywhere. You spread rumors about them. And you make news with a photo. Anyone would be angry. If Rishi Sir had the courage to speak, he would have been held wrong. But he was right.
He is right

He is such cute little lion 🦁

The dirty and cheap utube channels like u create problems in their personal lives

😂😂😂😂😂

Modhu-chakro-r business Man.

He is the best ever....... He is so humble and he knows very well how to handle every situation easily....... That&#39;s why I&#39;m a die heart fan of Rishi And Neetu

There is no evil anywhere..
Guys samjhoo bimari thi, irritation hota hoga

Neetu Singh get married to black American

Hamare pass to gadi hi ni h

Media people make actor life 😔😔😔

Why this movie reporters act like beggars

Strict Old RIP person

It&#39;s true, have you seen the indian media and press lately? the press and papparazzi shouting during dilip kumars funeral? total disrespect!

Sahi to bol rahe he rishijidiscipline honi tohiye
What have they read to see..!!What is God??
You are right, media people just want views.
Phatan, Phatan hota hay
Rishi ji didn't think much that this guy has made a lot of noise.
Indian media chutiya hey sala
R..I...P...

Star never bad.. never to the public, never to the media, it is true that even the people who want to understand themselves are true.
Aaj rishi ji ko dekh ke unki bachpn ki tsveer yd a gyi

Rishi kapoor is so honest and right about slapping that disobedient, treacherous media.This media is sly group. He should have really slapped media for misbehaving.So sad such a nice actor left the world.

He is right .

Chunky Pandey looked the most afraid man on earth.Such was the aura and respect for Rishi Kapoor.

He is such a legend iconic superstar

He is totally right

Alia ranbir

Big successful people hide most of the fact which can save us from many popular illusion that they&#39;re the most luckiest human on earth if they have money and fame.

He is little angry type of man with high temper but he talks logically and His words are always correct 🤘❤ he has amazing sense 🔥

This media box🤣Who is this, where does he come from🤣
Ye media wale photo kheench rehe hain yaa bheekh maang rahe hain???Alia alia aliaRanbir Ranbir Ranbir Shahid ShahidWhat the rubbish is this!!Thoda sa dignity toh rakho

RIP RISHI JI😭
bhangar aliya
These are the people who sacrificed their lives for the independence of this country. The love or respect of those people whose father or husband martyred in Kargil or Pulwama is not equal to the date of that hero. Jai Hind Jai Bharat

Cheap Media

Khadus

Media is a big basturd

Jab unhe jarurat thi tab ranbir was not there with Rishi sir... really bad

Example : 0 talent person with right persons at the right time and right place = chunkey Pandey

🤩🤩 he is good person
I never liked alia... she nothing...na alia ke paas height hai na facecit no features  no talent only show put up... accha hua ki alia mujhe phele se hi pasand nahi.. she looks pale n sick....issse far better talented n beautiful girls serials mein hai......

He was a very bad man, I have seen for myself that his humanity was proud of strangers.
arrogant old man
Ignore the media
Who is seeing this in 2020

Love Bollywood 😭😭😭💔💔💔💔🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
Ranbir is his father&#39;s son whatever we say.

Indian Media is a bunch of dogs Rip Rishi sir still missing you

Why are you making this cute video?
Honest answer.. Sometimes medias are irritating

You are only interested in media.
He is right when he is saying shor mat machao padosi ko taklif na ho

Front of ranbir kapoor? Wo to baad me aaya. Ye youtuber bhi in cameramen&#39;s ki tarah hi hai.

Who were are the 2 people entred last

Firstly what kind of media is this, what is the need of these people and why should we go after them…not secondly, what kind of media is this?
You guys are crazy as fuck how can you demand silence when you yourself choose to be on limelight!! If you don&#39;t want camera then quit this Job. There are many living example who has done so.

Good one rishi sir.... Ye mother sister scolded him well.
Rishi ji told everyone in a very literary manner...he also thinks about the travelers in the world...don't make any noise, he is saying...
Rip

Love this legend

BakwasOsne media ko bola thapad mar gaHahaha

Completely straight forward aadmi hay bhai rishi g

Pure heart person

Head Masterji
See the attitude  hi thik his a only smart person in the world

chod do rasta aor apni apni gaari mein bathiye Kya awaaz they♥♥

Well said sir
Co in on co hmm ki go

I think one of the reasons why he was always angry &amp; frustrated could be side effects of the medication he may have been on. I speak from a person experience.  Some of those cancer/pain medications are fairly strong

A lot of love for him

Bhopdike caption kahe galat likhte ho be

How much more can Gandu Log show? How much more I put in the video.
We love you Rishi Sir!❤❤❤
Alas, these people who read the words before they die, go to heaven….without regrets, they read the words, ALLAH IS GREAT…..WHAT HAVE YOU TAKEN FROM JAHANAMMI? ..ALLAH'S KALMA PADE BAGAYER MAR GAYA.....I HAD PAISE WAL.....FIRST BHI JOHNANI HAD GOAYA....ALLAH HAS BEEN AWFUL....ALLAH'S FORCE HAS BEEN FUCKING PASSED US. By reading the scriptures, I have given the gift of Allah ILLALLAH MADUR RASUL ALLAH...ALLAH'S FAVOR IS...YAHI HAS HIS RIGHT...I HAVE PREPARED TO MURREN BEFORE MARNEY.... We worship Allah and His Messenger...
Even after speaking, the media people took shots...he is a shameless log, he has no dignity.
chup chutiyo isne jo thumbnail bola hai real video bola nahi

Goru ka maas khenewalo ke pad mat hai yaar.Anti hindu person wo shala Randybaaz
He is right. He has spent his entire life in this industry and must have been fed up with people behaving like this. Others must have still had some patience left but not him. I would do worse.

great person

Why is the public demanding so much for these stupid people 😡😡
Chunky pandey😂😂😂😂

Very good discipline man

He is now old man  . Media can&#39;t understand old person.

Bande kuch baat toh thi.. Dil ka saaf tha ye banda

He was very straight forward human being with pure heart

There is no respect, what about the media?
We miss the demise of Irfan Khan more than Rishi kapoor Rishi was sometimes rude with media and short tempered.

Chatu Media 😛😜🤪😋
The people who run after celebrities are the most liked in the world.
Rishi ji your were such a great person.

Friend, you are also a reporter, why do you give so much emotion to people?
We will miss you..RIP ,🙏🏽

How much do I eat the movies myself, like a dog
Rishi kapoor miss you love from pakistan 🇵🇰

After death everyone is told what to do.
Now I feel we really lost a gem....😭😭😭

Abe bsdk... Galat news kyun de raha hai... Matlab kuch liye kuch bhi... ??
Indian media, esp the paparazi type need to be banned forever.

Pagal mat bna

Edited your photo and put it on sale on thumbnail.
ASHA huya mr giya
What is wrong in this, brother, if something goes wrong then an old and senior person gets angry and should also get angry.
Actor mean kha............  hahaha hahaha hahaha
Not reayality just davil activities ignore all this life and save generations

How shameless the camera people are, even after being reprimanded like this, they are still doing the same thing.
This money is called media, is it worth it??? The whole dog's pan is like a goose, it's just a donkey in everyone's life.

Ranbir Kapoor Like a dog, a human being should not be anyone's son. He should not give up his father's honor and should not be a dirty son.
There is only one thing left in my mind...
No one had thought that this Diwali 2019 would be Rishi Kapoor's last Diwali. Everything happens at the hands of God.

Rishi ji khile dil ke ensan the. Darte nhi the

He was just like a typical brown dad.. cute.. my dad is against too of loud music in the society.  Ese logo ka sir per pyar ho to life asan or achi ban jati hai. He was a genuine human being. You&#39;ll be missed sir!

Jhoot keu kahti hou ki rashi Kapoor ni media ko kaha tha.jhoot bol kar pasa kamati hou.

Hay ! You   should   mention   that   he ( Rishi Kapoor Sir )  had   shown   love   respect   and honour   to   media , media  persons .      .      .    <a href="">01:06</a>     .     .

Hay ! You   should   mention   that   he ( Rishi Kapoor Sir )  had   shown   love   respect   and honour   to   media , media  persons .

Great man sir rishi kapoor

I agree with Rishi . These are uncouth people who behave like bandicoots &amp; encroach on peoples privacy.

Rishi kapoor Sir 💐💐💐💐
I think <a href="">2:15</a> ranveer crying  rishi kapoor angry something happend

Good very stick .

Rashi Sahab has spent his whole life angry.
change the tumbil, and write truth..

I have to say what I want to say on my face.
so rude

What a civilized man he was ! His accent of Urdu language was very good. Very sad to see him gone. His departure is a loss. Love from Pakistan.

India media too much disturb the life of celebrities  ...🤔🤔🤔🤔

A log kutte ki tarha har ber chilam chili karte hay...
The only person in India that gave the advise to media to be humble and quiet and everyone needs it

I don't have any problem with the media people, but these people are eager to follow the celebrities like dogs.
Rishi Kapoor was right as he knew how to deal with these 3 rd class mumbaiya bollywood reporters.These bunch of fools even don&#39;t know how to behave publicly.They always shouting like anything whenever they see any celebrity.

Wakai baat thi unmey
This media's pride is a broker.
It is true that the media shout like this that this is the market.
Why did I feel that Rishi Da was ignoring Chunky Pandey a bit? I don't know why I felt so.
When I listen to the human being from all sides, I come to Smj to know that we do not have any children and we are not alive, how do we describe the human being? I remembered this thing on sb cmmnt pad.
Chunky Pandey was afraid 😁

I agree wd rishi...this media also keeps on talking to these people...the genes don't give it to them.
Why can&#39;t media leave them alone? There is no reason to Capture every single thing and post it as news saying inlogo ne aise Diwali manaya etc etc. I mean whole India Diwali mana raha hota hai what&#39;s the big deal. There should be some kind of privacy....aise camera leke piche piche bhaagna is such a silly thing. Pehle decide Karo is it really worth showing as &quot;news&quot;. His reaction was right, there should be some decorum. They are normal human beings and want to be treated normally.

good he is very Straight forward

OMG this Media.  Shor shor behave yaar.

Nice person thy...ALLAH PAK maghfirat krain enki

Rishi sir was right wow he was a decent person as well as he is a versatile actors too

Rishi Kapoor always best
There is not much difference between the media wale or the dog, where you see the bones, where the ladne lagte hai, Rishi Sir has given the understanding.
One day, yes, even if a photographer, an actor/actress gets a heart attack, he will die.
He is a senior actor and has seen media from different generations. The media before where much more professional and knew how to do their work unlike today&#39;s cheap media who keeps on screaming as they are in some kind of macchi market and running behind any stupid celebrity like Neha Dhupia and malika, arjun kapoor etc etc. So whatever he is saying is the fact and truth direct on their faces. He gets angry for a reason. Caz ye aaj kal k crap media sudar ne wale nai hai. He is better than jaya bachan just see her videos how she deal with her fans and media. Comparing to jaya he is 1000 times much better and straight to the point. And he has the right unlike some stupid celebrities who really don&#39;t even have the right a but still disrespects fans and media like jaya bachan etc.

Galat Kya bola unhone bekkar title's dalte hai
Faltu ke video chal kar kisi ki image spoi krna agar ye intention hai to sambhal jao... video me vese galat bhi kuch nai hai..wo society me rhe te hai.. faltu shoor hoga to log inhe hi bolege...apne liye star hai ,society walo ke liye roz ka hai ye...he showed very middle class behaviour else which super star talks like this we stay in society. Pepole will shout on us for noise ur making... <a href="">0:27</a> he shouted then wrapped up so politely <a href="">0:55</a> not everyone has this quality. 🙌

Sahi kha ,,bcz or log v h

He is completely ryt

Who understands the false Indian media?
100 Taka Sahi Bola Apne Rishi jee ne.
He is a gentleman... very dignified &amp;disciplined person.. Rishi ji we miss u😢

By making ChutiyA mat
Rishiji is absolutely right, he is angry, media is creating too much drama.
3;49. what the fu**.. camera man was on fire 🔥  😂

These people are Gods, what are you who see and show so much?
Shi to bol rhe hai

Arrogant and smart handsome actor.

I agree that hame unke talent ki respect karna Chahiye butYaar tum log tho hadh krdete ho...wo jaha Kahi bhi Jaye tum camera lekar chale jate hoWo bhi hamri tarha insaan hi hForeign countries m celebs ko itna bhav n dete....

he was a character..salute!

He is straight forward

You did not make any profit from my work.
Who said the right thing and what was wrong?
Journalist has fallen so low. Thu
Shi bol rhe hai sir

Looks like Rishikpurwa was completely over. See the video how you insulted Chunky while shaking hands. Now God will take account of you. You supported BJP, you bitch.
Salejhut topic wale..i will never watch your vedios

Who will upload your video?
These people don't even know how to get so much money or how much money they have got.
Why are you feeling shameless when you believe that what are you saying for log videos?
Someone will say something like this
The cameraman is so cheeky, he keeps disturbing the people by making noise. Now look, these people have mind washed Rishi Kapoor ji, ask for the last, I had to get angry.
Ranbir kch jyaaada hi nashedii hai......... bloody scoundrel ..for me.he is the reason for his great father&#39;s death

He is always straight forward and I like him so much

God app Ashe logo ko kyu le jate ho

Rishi ji is right
He is such a sweet person &amp; a very good human being. He had concern for every one.

Ye journalists toh aise Alia Alia Ranbir Ranbir chilla rahe the jaise ki woh un sab ki bachpan ki dost hai

Ya ranver to ktrena boyfriend ta

The media has created a market of ignorant bastards, Indian media should learn some manner😡😡😡😡 so irritating.
Awndha hokar marta hospital me alone hi suwar

Galat thumbnails kyu use karte ho vai

Rishi sir misss uuuu you are very gentle man person the😣😣😣😣😣😣😣
<a href="">3:22</a> what’s her name?

He is angry for a reason unlike Jaya bachan who is naturally bad tempered lady but  people very unfairly finding similarities between the two.

omg these craps stupid  so much noise

Great rishi kapoorr
What true bath did you say sir? No noise should be made. We should always think about the suffering of others. Whoever will be sick, will have to undergo exam. Wow such a wise man.
Bechare ka last diwali tha
