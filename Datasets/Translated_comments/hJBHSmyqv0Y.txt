Leave a like so I get reminded of this awesome song

Missing the one juu when i hear this song

Sorry... because we are finding something lacking in the writing of this song.. You have written that.. Ram Padhare.. Siya Aur Lakhan Ke Saat.. You have forgotten Hanumanji.. When Ram Awadh. When he returned, his seven Hanumanjis had also come to Awadh.. And if we were singers, we would have first read the entire poem or this story, pondered over it, and if there was any mistake, we would have corrected it and then sung. Sorry singers..it is nice but a very wrong try..plz love music from your heart..just dont sing blindly..
They should cast in ashiqui 3 not ariyan or tripti

Wow!

After watching this song I also thought once in life I should do this

Lyrics are awesome....

I don't know what happened to my heart, when I met you, you felt like mine, how should I tell you, is this passion or pride, this is how I met you, you met me, like on a bright day, where do we go, where do we go, whatever my heart says, whichever way I go, I want only you, from now on I am yours, you are my path. I too am yours, whichever way I go, I want you only, from now on I am you, my way, I am also yours, my heart is indebted to you, from now on, what is this disease of yours, tell me, what name should I give, no one else should understand that you are the one in my tongue, I have not seen the madness of me, nowhere else can the days start with you. Now don't move away from my sight. As much as I am leisurely, I am giving you all the time. Whichever way I go, I want you only. From now on, I am mine, you are my way, I am also yours. Whichever way I go, I want you only. From now on, I am mine, you are my way, I am also yours, my heart is grateful now. What kind of a disease is this of yours? What name should I give to the walls of a broken heart? Today my eyes have seen the sky of dreams. I thank you. Whichever path I go, I love you only. From now on, I am mine, you are mine, I am also yours, whichever path I go, I love you only. From now on, I want you, I am yours, I am also yours, I am yours, I am also yours, my heart is grateful to you, from now on, this is yours (o o o o) How is this disease, what name should I give (a aa aa aa)Translate to EnglishSource: LyricFindSongwriters: Kunal Varma
love you Aditya 
This song is really special for me because, i liked a boy and I always tried to tell him about my feelings but I Couldn&#39;t. He had a gf then not serious but for fun that also made me cry every night. One day e sent me this song. I Don&#39;t know why I thought he also like me. Later he expressed his feelings. And told that he sent me this song bcoz he loved me but scared if we lose out frndship.

How do you know 

the beats are awesome 

Best one....

How many of You have already watched this movie before Liking My Comment 

This one is a sick track, recently hearing all Malang songs..but this one stands out for me more than the title track...the music is lit, and Sachet&#39;s voice is pure class, need more Sachet&#39;s songs in future.

Nice song
Never ignore a person who loves you,cares for you because you may wake up from your sleep and realize that you lost the moon while counting stars. LOVE YOU.....

I don't know what happened to my heart, when I met you, you felt like mine, how should I tell you, is this passion or pride, this is how I met you, you met me, like on a bright day, where do we go, where do we go, whatever my heart says, whichever way I go, I want only you, from now on I am yours, you are my path. I too am yours, whichever way I go, I want you only, from now on I am you, my way, I am also yours, my heart is indebted to you, from now on, what is this disease of yours, tell me, what name should I give, no one else should understand that you are the one in my tongue, I have not seen the madness of me, nowhere else can the days start with you. Now don't move away from my sight. As much as I am leisurely, I am giving you all the time. Whichever way I go, I want you only. From now on, I am mine, you are my way, I am also yours. Whichever way I go, I want you only. From now on, I am mine, you are my way, I am also yours, my heart is grateful now. What kind of a disease is this of yours? What name should I give to the walls of a broken heart? Today my eyes have seen the sky of dreams. I thank you. Whichever path I go, I love you only. From now on, I am mine, you are mine, I am also yours, whichever path I go, I love you only. From now on, I want you, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, whatever way, my heart is grateful, from now on it is yours (o o o o o) How is this disease, what name should I give, tell me (a aa aa aa)

Jesus Christ SavesJesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.Biblical References:1. Romans 5:92. Romans 3:233. Romans 6:234. Romans 10:95. Romans 10:136. Ephesians 2: 8 &amp; 97. John 3:16God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
