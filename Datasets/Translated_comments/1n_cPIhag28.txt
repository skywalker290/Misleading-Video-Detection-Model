just deleted  my twitter, cant live with all that hate :D

4 years ago, I disliked this videoToday, i rewatched this and liked it.guess that&#39;s character development ‍‍

He predicted the future logo of Twitter

this video was very necessary. thanks.

This is one of my favorite videos on Youtube.

Twitter is a miserable place to be active

WHY IS THERE AN X IN THE THUMBNAIL?

The worst trash humans can create

&quot;If youre going to shoot, shoot! Dont talk!&quot; Best line ever



Already around 3 years and It&#39;s still happening on Twitter.

Pewdiepie, thank you for the philosophy you discuss and specifically this video with the review of Nicomachean Ethics. It changed my life.

. Lasterated m Alicia keys f
*𝕏
*X

who else here in 2023

How you&#39;re pressed about the likes on Twitter for what people post but you&#39;re on Youtube?? This is a Dumb way of thinking.

And now, Twitter&#39;s gone and Pewds living a happy life with his wife and kid. Good ending.

The thumbnail predicted twitters renaming to X 

Twitter is now safe to exercise your right to freedom of expression without censorship now that Elon Musk is holding the reins. Come back to twitter pewds!

Insane how this video is still accurate to this day

interesting.

this vid was cool but i wish he went into why twitter was bad more cause i got lost in all the other stuff

On Twitter is a lot of porn*graphy

i agree with this, which is why i have never touched twitter

WHY IS EVERYONE HATING ON TWITTER!?!?!?

Me to

And Eli musk is full of s***phony bulshit about freedom of speech and democracy and voting and why did you put a yaccarino in I actually love you too baby YouTubee as I call it affectionately we can&#39;t say it too loud cuz Miss Elon musk will want to try to buy it and take over he is not the richest man in the world  anymore and he certainly isn&#39;t rich in what it takes or the richest and what it takes  I am an infatuated and uninterested in Elon musk as his mask is come off and what he is

I hate Twitter cuz they treat you their infantile like with their punishment and you&#39;re suspended I&#39;m not your f*<b>***</b> child

This video changed my life for good. Thank you Felix! 

I always watch this video just to remind myself that i never ever getting a twitter account.

Who&#39;s here after verification badges of multiple accounts got removed

rewatching, nothing&#39;s changed after 3 years.

If you use Twitter , you are wasting time. If you don&#39;t use Twitter , you are saving time. Thank you Elon Musk for making Twitter better but still god is better then Twitter. If an atheist No Twitter is better than Twitter.

Same

Making a good joke on twitter is basically illegal.

It was a good video that didn&#39;t trash Twitter enough, and lacked curtness

Still 100% accurate
I hate twitter VERY MUCH

I&#39;ve deleted this app 3 months ago, and never looking back. Best choice ever! Am finally getting good marks and shit.

I come back to watch this video every once in a while. Such an amazing video

This video is over 3 years old now, and everything Pewds says here still holds up.Delete your Twitter account and suddenly the entire planet seems like a better place.

I’ve had this same problem with a goddamn  video game Dunkey video.

all social media is toxic. the more I use it, the worse my mental health gets. It’s hard to find a healthy balance when it comes down to it

Came for dunking on Twitter, stayed for the philosophy

This video still relevant to this day.

THIS IS RELEVANT FOR MR BEAST ISSUE, LOLTHIS VIDEO IS TIMELESS

This aged real well with the Mr Beast Dumbrama

Love that you explained your thoughts in such clarity, and I totally agree with you on almost all of these points, Felix.

twitter is cancer

Today's Japan is so instinctively bombarded with slander that it makes me sick to the core and makes me cry. Twitter is the biggest platform in Japan, so it's difficult to understand the language, but lately I've been using reddit.
Even Aristotle did not truly understand virtue. He and other Greek philosophers lead to women of their time and beyond, and you can see this in much of the philosophy community today unfortunately, believed very dehumanizing and easily disproven things about women and supported slavery. He said a lot of great things of course, but Aristotle and the people like him did not truly understand morality or virtue, God does.

I know I can&#39;t log in to twitter anymore, this is why.... This is why I hate TWITTER SO MUCH FOR RUINING US!

For real and they get after people first things years ago they do not know how to let go of shit

Proof that peediepie haters in twitter really doesn&#39;t know what kind of guy he is. They&#39;re too blinded by their own virtue-signaling and the idea of how bunch of pure unproblematic people they are

What&#39;s the background music?

this video just made me wanna delete my twitter LOL

anybody tell me what is the background music in this video??

It&#39;s just bragging about yourself. Since most people are so full of themselves, it&#39;s perfect.

It quickly turned from I hate Twitter video to a freaking philosophy

<a href="">6:11</a> doesent that stuff come from socrates?

this is the most underrate pewds video

Hi Felix! With all that is happening with Twitter in 2022, you&#39;re right here. Please send my regards to Marzia and your neighbours there in Japan.

Damn men im just learning this college and I just come by to it

Don&#39;t worry, Pewdiepie. Hopefully Elon will bankrupt it off the Internet

This video aged like fine wine

Same

twitter is so pathetic and down right bullshit

Twitter and Satan&#39;s Hell has no difference about it

One of the timeless classic from Pewds. Created my own account a couple of weeks back being glad about the Elon takeover, and I will say this: he may change the rules of the allowed speech for the better, but he won&#39;t change people. They are a disaster there. They will always be as Pewds is describing them in this vid. Twitter will always be a polution to your brain. So much noise, and so little actual value. I&#39;m opting out, but wish Elon good luck.

Twitter&#39;s for twats

Here after chief twit took over

u know whats interesting.. Jesus fought these people all the time.. people who act virtuous say virtuous things but had no real action.

I&#39;ve never heard you say fuck before. It was always sensored in other videos

Twitter is crap

All of this came from “I hate twitter”

I got banned for 48 hours for saying terrorists deserve capital punishment then a perma ban today for saying a violent Scottish feminist deserved a few equality jabs and a freedom punch... A new low for me...

Twitter is so pathetic it will go out if it&#39;s way to fabricate lies and slander on good people just because they can. Look into the Arin Hanson &quot;scandal&quot; and remember that the person who started it had to make an apology tweet after being found to be a liar and a faker.

Twitter sucks

I came for Twitter, I stayed for the philosophy

Sometimes I feel like going to Twitter&#39;s mainframe then blowing the cables out of it, to shut down that site forever

Big W
Now a portion of the website is celebrating the Queen’s passing. It’s disrespectful.

All my homies hate twitter

And the fact that they were the one that made the app Vine nonexistent.

I want to make a new Twitter account to use as promotion for my illustrations. I am in asia so i expect i will not be as unfortunate as others because I will not have much exposure outside but i am still scared. Are there more ways to avoid undesirable audience?

Company is garbage!

Twatter and twacker!

Is this the same guy who jumps out of a closet screaming reeeeeEEEEEE??

“It&#39;s hard to win an argument with a smart person. It&#39;s damn near impossible to win an argument with a stupid person.”― Bill Murray

Haha well.... It got worse

i got 3 definitive banon the same account

This video is fitting after that clip of the girl&#39;s nails.

Idk Should I make a twitter to just get some friend an make art but possibly never get knownOr should I just stay with the small pool of friends on my discord servers  an never touch twitter but not gain any more friends an just practice my work

&quot;I hate Twitter&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure everyone apart from those who use Twitter hates it

2022 and its just getting worse

2 years on Twitter i hate Twitter

The question is how does twitter cancel you if I never even used it?

I used to enjoy arguing with idiots, Twitter made it a chore

We all hate it too

Every day, my respect for this video grows More and moreWouldn&#39;t you agree

This video is still great And fuck twitter

I feel like this video will always be relevant no matter how far we proceed.

Who&#39;s still here after Pewds get cancelled over someone&#39;s long nails?

Good video

So in a nut shell every human should be in the gray area? Not being a coward and not being overconfident for example.

this aged like fine wine

Even the lowest of the low redditors hate twitter, think about that nut.

history repeats itself

This video became relevant again

Got this in recemmondation after the hate of twitter users about that deaf girl lol.

He left Twitter, ignored their barking, focused on what he wanted to do in life and now he&#39;s living a good life in the country that he always loved with his beautiful wife, his dogs and his wealth.And the Twitter mob absolutely hate seeing that.

This aged like fine wine

Keep hating it. It&#39;s never getting better
Focusing on self improvement while ignoring haters is the absolute king shit that will pissed off critics.

You still making fun of deaf people and being over all trash?

This aged like fine wine

F Twitter

Paranoid personality disorder is common among Twitter users and is more prevalent under trending topics, which is why I don&#39;t use Twitter.  Because of my mental health, that place is too dirty for me.

twitter fanboys

I agree, I don&#39;t have twitter.

NSFW is Too Based

Can&#39;t lie fighting someone on Twitter won&#39;t gain anything tbh

I honestly hate Twitter

Twitter users : 
Based move

F TWT

Twitter is a cesspool where people say things that seem moral, then shoot themselves on the foot by acting immoral. Groups call out and try to cause drama and clout, then get called out by another group, then they get called out themselves, and the cycle repeats. People there preach about doing good things and thing bad, but end up throwing that out the window when they don’t like someone. If you’re doing less, you’re lazy and boring, but if you do more, you’re arrogant or trying to fit in. If you don’t block, you’re subjecting yourself to more abuse and feeling less safe online, but if you block, you’re a coward and shouldn’t be on the internet. I hate this. People are like “block people you don’t like or if you don’t feel safe” and yet shame those who do. People express loving people of many races, yet try to “fix” POC’s art over one tiny detail they projected their internalized racism on or refuse to do commission stuff with.

I just deleted my twitter account I hope i did the right thing lmao

i just learned more than all my classes in school classes combined

Turns out, nothing changed.

Ultron wanted to destroy humanity after he knew about twitter.

twitter though i think is the home of toxic people online. Endless nonstop nonsense arguments day and night that you don&#39;t wanna be in.

Same pewds, same
This is still one of the most well delivered essays on Greek philosophy I’ve ever seen

Do people like Twitter..?

Twitter when you post anything: that&#39;s shreksual assault.Twitter when a content gets too much political and racist: approvedHumanity is evolving, just backwards.

Well elon owned twitter now

What&#39;s twitter

Change is coming!

This aged like perfect wine.

Well well well

Apparently, twitter will actually be good now that elon musk has bought it...

Welcome back to twitter.

Great video

i really appreciate this video now that i am older

Yep.

This one is a big brain  This is so true 

still relevant after what happened to IShowSpeed lol.

STILL RELEVANT
All of this started because of a certain shop-lifter who still think she’s a legit artist, celebrated the robbery that happened  to Pewdiepie, when that happened to Marzia, who was robbed of an object of sentimental values.Then, the mob celebrated it, while the sane people made positive comics featuring NewGuy, and how empathy is important, those answers were called &quot;transphobic&quot; and whatnot.The shop-lifter dealt with karma, her friends, people she looked after, turned their backs on her and stopped supporting her comics, throught she still have the nerves to ask for donations.She should have been punished by the site, not you, both you and your wife deserved better than this shit.Then again, it’s Twitter, if they wish to stand for shop-lifters and child-abusers, their loss.

2 years ago i wouldnt have thought a video titled &quot;i hate twitter&quot; would be the video that inspires me to change my life, thank you pewds

this guy hates everything even Dhar Mann (just asking)

Twitter SUCKS, religion sucks, politics sucks

Here’s Pewdiepie spitting facts!
My Twitter account just disappeared so all I did was delete it going on to TikTok

Can PewDiePie start making these his normal videos

3nd yourself

I hate Twitter, I hate Twitter, I hate Twitter

Unsubscribed because of this video

DO MORE VIDEOS LIEK THIS WTF
I just love your mind! I love philosophy and existential thinking and these book recommendations are giving me life

i didnt understand what this had to do with twitter

I feel like Pewds talked about more things and Aristotle.

This video started as twitter tweets to Greek philosophy

Nahh bro f** Twitter so many 13 years old.pedo  and bullies ALSO F*** age Shamers!

First

I agree about Twitter is stupid it just stupid people that use Twitter sometimes get more stupid they start hating for no reason so that&#39;s very stupid

“Will delete PewDiePie at 100M subs!”He meant PewDiePie twitter

How about facebook hahahaha

Twitter sucks, religion sucks, politics sucks

hell yea pewds keep it up

&quot;then why do you want to be happy?&quot;

Twitter got mad at me cuz I and adult woman did a nezuko cosplay.... cuz she’s a minor

Twitter is much much more dangerous than a million nuke facing you

Wise choice for him that he left twatter long ago and nerver coming back

twittcrap sucks

religion is bs and gods dont exist

I deleted Twitter after 5 minutes of playing

i used twitter once but i deleted it after i created my first account. But it still sucks for me.

I shall follow the path of the golden meme

Twitter is dogshit

still relevant
i came back 3 years later to say that I got interested in the book, and bought it, and now reading it I find it very fascinating how it&#39;s not talked about enough. It literally sums up life in a way

twatter

.-.

This is very inspirational. What a speech. This is awesome it&#39;s really inspiring and this inspired me to delete twitter

To people reading this , Delete all social medias , yes every one of them ,Twitter reddit Instagram discord etc .Instead talk with your parents /friends Develop some skills that you are interested in /find a hobby Go outside /workout /sleep and eat at proper times Once you are freed from the chains of social media you will find time and happiness i gurantee you that

Still relevant as of today

I insulted the nft community my proudest moments on twitter

Sobody: <b>breaths</b>Twwiter: OMGGG THATS SOO OFFENSIVE TO PLANTS STOP STEALING THEIR AIRRRR

No way in hell im gonna let some self diagnosed depressed , PTSD, Fake gender users cancelling me for things i like

I think twitter is a good reality check. People are most honest about their opinions on twitter and hence by seeing at the number of likes , we get a general sense as to how many people abide by what was mentioned in that particular tweet and for exactly that reason I think twitter is useful

“Hard times give strong men, strong men give good times, good times give weak men, weak men give hard times”Literally sums up the transition of the 21st century

I think they should start screening and approving who makes YOUTUBE videos because you people make no sense at all.  You bore the F out of me I have to go!

haha dish xD
song in the background is  chowder by Dylan sitts

I hate this video.

This video aged well, like fine wine.

i miss these type of vids

Same bro

January 2022 Update: It&#39;s been 2 years since book reviews started dropping and I was always intrigued by these videos, but never took the step of doing further research, actually looking into the philosophy or readings, but now, in 2022 it seems like it&#39;s starting to impact me. I&#39;ve started enjoying philosophies and it&#39;s hard to say it&#39;s not because of these videos as most likely these were what introduced me into stoicism in particular. This led to me looking into it now, in early 2022, in the origins of stoicism, all the way from Zeno, to Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.

This was quite entlighting because as you said in these videos, you probably already practiced this concept of self discipline and getting between stimuli and response - and it is actually true. Looking into stoicism actually made me discover my own actions and thinking and putting them into actual concepts, since a lot of these concepts I&#39;ve already practiced in small terms. One example being the concept of Euthymia - believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path. As people in the modern world would say &quot;trust the process&quot;. 

It&#39;s actually crazy to see how stoicism is so relevant in the now even though you never knew its origins. 

This led me to looking into eudaimonia, tranquility, the art of acquiescence, the equanimity game and practicing the ideal sage. 



This also helped me with my own friends and family, when they ask me for advice, due to the knowledge rooted in stoicism, my responses seem to create more of a positive impact on them as they&#39;re questions and concepts rooted in rationalisation which people can grasp and relate to.

All in all, starting with stoicism, I started looking into other philosophies, including nihilism and hedonism and thus far I&#39;m loving it and I feel like I&#39;m learning day by day, taking things that I like from each piece of ancient and modern philosophy and applying it in various aspects of my life.



With all of that in mind, I just wrote this message to say 

- Thank you PewDiePie
The left is rising

On twitter you’re opinion doesn’t matter or that is what I heard

Twitter is garbage,Twitter is nothing but communism, they regulate what you  can say,it is not a platform for different opinions,I advise as many people as I can to boycott the garbage Twitter

I decided to delete twitter for the foreseeable future. Twitter is a cesspool of people who just want to be miserable and a waste of time. I really regret the amount of them I wasted arguing with random people on the internet. I don’t follow anyone I know irl on twitter so it doesn’t give me any other reason to keep the app, compared to Facebook or Instagram.

Yea, mee too
After seeing this videoima quit fucking twitter

This video was ahead of it&#39;s time

I&#39;m kinda getting cancelled on twitter for having an opinion lol nice

Twitter is bad for your health. It&#39;s so toxic that it will decreases your life expectancy by stress

2yrs later still...Yes, fuck Twitter.

I love how this escalated from hating Twitter to the philosophical definition of happiness..

This is one of the best videos pewds has ever made. I agree with this video more and more as each year passes.

thank you pewdiepie you really calmed me down

Should do this more often definitely enjoyed this one

it&#39;s been a year since this vid edit. just remembered that i deleted my twitter months ago.

I really like rant video of pewds like this

It&#39;s two years since he has deleted his twitter

plato is a virgon philosopher. diogenes is the gigachad of philosophy

I love how half this video has nothing to do with Twitter as Pewds just goes on this huge tangent about Greek philosophy.  Twitter is completely horrible, though, for these reasons and many others.

Hamburgers = Happiness

When you click on a video about twitter and get a full philosophy lecture

Agreed

Im not gonna download twitter and will never ne

I don&#39;t know why but i keep coming back to this video for a philosophy dose...and i just like listening to this video.

I hate it either it GETS ME BANNED FOR FOLLOWING TOO MANY PEOPLE FU, K YOU TWITTER 
You don&#39;t hate Twitter, you hate Twitter users.

J.K. Rowling is such a troll, love her.

why was this actually a really good alevel philosophy revision video .. thx

this video never gets old.

I saw somewhere that Twitter is basically American social credit

This is for people who hate PewDiePie without a good reason.

Who&#39;s gonna sacrifice himself and post : &quot; I didn&#39;t like Kpop&quot; ?I&#39;m gonna bet $100 atleast 10 people will get offended

Ah crap, it became worse

Cut their fiber.

I Hate Twitter.

tweet

twitter is a dis.. mista...<b><i>a good media platform</i></b>

Twitter is ran by immoral and unethical charlatans!!!!

I hate Twitter so much I wish Twitter was not a thing

Pewdiepie is far right white supremacy?

You probably haven&#39;t thought about this video in a while, but I really like this kind of video, especially from you

same

Usually people lose their chillbone too fast when they reply in social media apps, I‘ll just be grateful that I’m not like those people!

I feel like I must be VERY lucky for not using twitter:))))

Somebody shares a opinion on Twitter Twitter:so you have chosen death

TWITTCRAP SUCKS, thats not an opinion its a fact

Same.

I&#39;m going to ask you guys, what do you prefer, face book (an old social media) or Twitter, why

Twitter have a good side (the arts), but... mostly are a bad side (the toxic opinions and other stuff)glad I didn&#39;t have a twitter...

I left Twitter shortly after the 2020 election. It’s full of a bunch of crybabies. A few of self-proclaimed “progressives” kept bawling about the previous US President to the point of vilifying everyone who disagreed with them. That included several YouTubers in 2017.When 2020 came around,  they became even worse.   Twitter became such a cesspool that I left it in 2020.   I frankly don’t miss it.

Twitter is as dead as Facebook

Hub of Commies and toxic socialists

Somebody:walksTwitter: OMG THAT IS OFFENSIVE TO DISABLED PEOPLE OMG CANCELED!1!1!

By the way , Fu*K Twitter

Do more stop thinking about it and saying you&#39;re doing the right things do the right things do thinks that are productive.

good job on this video

I already hate Twitter since Twitter suspended my account eventhough I didn&#39;t do anything wrong but they didn&#39;t suspend those 18+ accounts

I like Twitter is my opinion and i know the facts but i like it

Wow I did not know that pewds was into my country&#39;s history.

I will forever keep twitter because it&#39;s how I keep up to date on my favorite shows and artistsAlso because I like laughing at people being idiots

just like earth is the shithole of the universe, twitter is the shithole of the virtual universe

This is a hood classic.

My respect for him after watching this videoThese people that just do stuff or say stuff that is morally trending but act the opposite with everything else annoy me so much. Twitter&#39;s full of the parasites and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t use it

I love ancient Greek philosophy too! Every time I think I&#39;ve read Everything there is to be read about Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates, I uncover more gems of knowledge and quotes every now and then that blow my mind 

Pewdiepie is a hidden genius
true someone attack me on twitter because of pronouns like literally chill im not attacking anyone

Imagine this is the First video of PewDiePie for some people.

Ban Twitter

Who else rewatches this every once in a while?

bro this man just gave us greek philosophy on why twitter is badabsolutely chad

A person literally told me to kill myself on twittertwitter send me message saying that they found that that account does breaks their rules



And his account is still upsomehow

Phew, lucky me, i never used Twitter in the first placeEdit: i just love listening to Felix speaks seriously, like he&#39;s the other side of Felix that we rarely heard

And now Everyone&#39;s storming twitter lmaooooo

everyone when this video released : nah pewd&#39;s just don&#39;t like twitter . twitter ain&#39;t toxic 1 year later every minecraft youtuber gets cancelled for the dumbest reason  . he was right listen to the pie people !

We hate Twitter

Twitter is full of negativity. Hate it so much. Even a small little joke can cause war.

Me too

Deactivated Twitter a few days ago. It will delete itself on Oct. 11.

What&#39;s funny is that there are celebrities who are actually problematic and have actually done way worse stuff, but for some reason people on Twitter ignore them and instead keep trying to cancel non-problematic celebrities over petty stuff, some of them even having apologized for the seemingly problematic stuff that they may have done unintentionally in the past.

Twitter is a cancer to the mind

Unfortunately i can&#39;t delete mine  because i made it a year ago

Using Twitter is like reading writings on toilet walls

Pewds spoke about twitter for like 5 sec and the entire comment section is about that lol

Ratio

I&#39;m not gonna lie, but this was actually a pretty satisfying video to watch!!!

I think about to delete Twitter it isn’t like 2014 anymore!! People insult me because I like the character of an actor Twitter is so toxic people tell i am a whore and stuff this are those people who has a anime picture as profile and stuff

just got a ad of twitter on a twitter hate video

Nice job pewds

you know twitter is also bad on another level when it&#39;s ceo is the long lost twin brother of OBL.

PewDiePie: btw fuck twitterAfter i watched the video<b>Twitter ad pops up</b>

Just delete the app from the face of the internet.

Thank you pewds
Does anyone know the background song he&#39;s using?

I’m glad that deleted Twitter, I wouldn’t have any empathy if it disappeared tomorrow!

Or you could&#39;ve just said <b>I FKING HATE TWITTER</b>

Finally someone says it.

Twitter has my account hostage..its full of ghetto crap

I&#39;ve never had twitter, I guess I did the right thing

what&#39;s the background music?

Someone is gonna get cancelled because of something they said in there past life.

This videos to me: Tell Me Something I Don&#39;t Know

Yaaay! Educational Pewdiepie! Would like to see more

agreed

I like how I clicked this video and had no idea it was PewDiePie

Its was felix arvid ulf kjellberg who&#39;s talking, not pewdiepie

I like your tone on this video, very calm and sincere.

baited us with twitter hate to talk to us about philosophy respect

I had Twitter for a few months and then deleted it. I thought it was boring and overrated as hell. Now knowing how most people act on there, I feel a whole lot better and made the right decision! :D

I never had Twitter but just by seeing one small glimpse of it...I already hate it seeing how just speaking truth would caused a massive app war in within 13 minutes

Twitter is run by Richard Spencer.

X Y Z

I&#39;d watch TikTok all day than being on twitter for a minute

After Carson’s legendary return, I can see why people hate twitter.

You butchered most Greek words, but great video 

“If you don’t agree with my views then you’re the lowest piece of life form on the planet earth and I will always be superior over you.” - Every Twitter user

I&#39;m very grateful and thankful to my lord because I&#39;m not a Twitter user.

this video aged like a wine that aged 1000 years old and if you drink it, you will achieve eternal satisfaction

Everyone talking about they left twitter to feel a 100 times betterMeanwhile me who never had a twitter :- 

If this keeps happening likeTommy got cancelled for saying finnaAnd the dream cake got attacked by some assholesIm moving to mars

Whats the background track bruh ?

&quot;Drinking alcohol won&#39;t affect my child&quot;9 months later: &quot;if you don&#39;t like kpop youre racist&quot;

Welcome to twitter The place of endless toxicity

God I&#39;m lucky I never got into twitter

God has an intense hatred against twitter

Cure to all disease: <b>delete twitter</b>

Got rid of Facebook and Twitter a year ago. Feel much better.

Twitter was a mistake

So glad I have No twitter : D

I agree Twitter should be shut down. Enough is enough

need more of this

Ive come back to this video everytime my twitter is flooded with them the virtue signaller

If hypocrite is a worker , Twitter would be an office.

This video gets more true day by day

I just want every youtuber to have an agreement to delete twitter

Every human with a brain hates Twitter it&#39;s normal lmao

im glad that i never started with twitter

twitter has to be the worst than tiktok

Pain

Twitter sucks for sure and will be going out of style very soon. World will be a better place without it.

Basically boycott any business that put ads on censor media.  Its part of the dumbown if you didnt realize it.  To bowdown to aliens or something.  Shame on anyone promoting those websites.   China laughing, soon will own you, wake up now.

Twitter is the dumbest app ever.

I just want to cancell twitter

Out of all the apps we lost, why not twitter

I hate it i actually hate it, it causes so many games to go down due to 9 year olds trying to get what they want!

The worth thing because of tweeter scott left

Opinions on twitter is just saying &quot;hey im here, come fuck me up&quot;

People in (Noah) Glass houses shouldn&#39;t throw (Biz) Stone!

I hate twitter cuz fnf mods are getting deleted cuz of tweetter

It deleted whitty mod i’m going to sue Twitter for that

Twitter is a big piece of garbage

Scott cawthon retired cuz of twitter

I was thinking about properly starting a Twitter account, but the community here is toxic and yet many artists still use it.I won’t.

Im 12 and get braincancer when i se &quot;ratio and &quot;you fell off&quot; by some random guy with a football pfp. Should i delete twitter?

just tweeted about how i dislike bowser fetish yesterday, then proceeded to receive hate tweets from bowser fans, gay furry peoplei deleted the tweet afterwardsit scared the shit out of me

I saw a dude who said the n word on Twitter, then he went on to say he is white. While I can agree, being racist is never a good thing, it isn&#39;t something worth getting doxed over. Most people on Twitter aren&#39;t even being racist, having an afro as a white person shouldn&#39;t be offensive, wearing a hijab as a non-Muslim shouldn&#39;t be offensive, and 14 year old K-Pop stans shouldn&#39;t be pissed over any of it.

Pewdiepie: i hate twitter Twitter: cancel him

This feels like an exurbia video. Very captivating!

“I hate Twitter”Yes Humans need water

Twitter in a nutshellIf you&#39;re a white male: You&#39;re a n@zi and dont deserve an opinion because of privileges and historyIf you&#39;re a man of any color: You aint a N@zi but because you got a banana your opinion is still invalid but you&#39;ll have a say here and there for being nonwhiteIf you&#39;re gay, trans, a woman, ect of any color: You are the second coming of chirst and your opinions are usually valid by twitter regardlessIf you&#39;re famous: You will need to look over every tweet you send regardless of how insignificant it is. Every public tweet, every private messages, every person you dated, people consider friends, people comed contact with can easily set your career into a depression so keep everything tight A troll: Everyone is your puppet. You are a wolf among sheep bent to spread chaos but your sheep costume is soo good that people cant tell if you really are a sheep or a wolf allowing you to strike them fierce while remaining as a sheep. The sheeps will be mad at you but all you got to do is simply remain calm and blend into the conversation while pretending to care potentially making it worst for everyone else A White Republican sympathizer: Why do you even have twitter? Fucking run man! Everyone here wants you dead!A Republican sympathizer of a colored race: You are seen as a backstabber. Many are baffled why you chose to be a Republican and why you dont support your own kindA Democrat: You are a idol. The one who defends the freedoms of a group who hate other people&#39;s opinions A colored/ female democrat: A GOD  AMONG MORTALS! WORSHIPPED TO THE END! YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE THE LEGENDS SPOKE OF!

Insta fake lifestyle &gt; Twitter toxicity

Me too I hate Twitter.

I hate Twitter

I hate twitter...it&#39;s a bunch of blood hungry people being getting high on self righteousness

Twitter right now can produce enough salt to suffice the needs of 7 billion people for the next 50 years

XYZ...

Really enjoy this video, I keep rewatching every few weeks

Banned trump but dems are OK lolI left twitter alot of bullying goes on that

Obviously

To cancel cancel rights twitter canceled their lives

Twitter NSFW accounts and horrible people and Cancel Culture are not compatible apparentlyBut both can screw up a normal dude that&#39;s just giving his opinionWtf

This is why I don&#39;t use Twitter 

I just literally got a Twitter ad at the beginning

You haven&#39;t seen or heard tiktok yet, brother.

Yea Twitter sucks

Omg that’s Munster I’m from there hah recognition <a href="">0:47</a>

it is a great video!! thank you and it made feel better

Twitter is trash I agree

its god, he never lies, and we all agree.

I don’t have any problems with any social media apps , but Twitter to begin is a terrible app you get easily suspended for no reason, trolls and ignorant people like Trump and his minions like Twitter I deleted Twitter one thing for all

Pewdepie, the greatest philosopher humans will ever see....

Imagine if tiktok and twitter combine

Never been on Twitter pog!!!

Pewdiepie can become a philosopher if he quits YouTube

Twitter is the worst

Me: do nothingEveryone on Twitter: Yep, Get cancelled

Twitter is actual garbage we’d be better without it

<a href="">0:34</a> can we all just laugh that his/her tweet has <b>6969</b> likes

Pewds : I hate twitter I think of deleting it all the time                              5 minutes later: deletes it...<b>*E v e r y o n e l i k e d t h a t*</b>

fun fact: Twitter is more toxic then you standing on the Chernobyl elephants foot

Twitter Is a Perfect Place for <b>A R G U M E N T S</b>

Coming back to this video for some relief from the BS of Twitter. Thank you Pewds for being a voice of reason for the internet.

twitter is on of the worst things ever created by humans. Maybe evebn worse than atomic bombs. The simple fact that politics are on this medium is so ridiculous, it tells a lot about what politics became. If you are on twitter you are a subhuman, there is no debate about this fact. Boycott twitter to regain your humanity.

I’m about to delete my twitter account, I have 4K and had so many viral tweets but it’s tiering and boring now and I don’t want the easy validation.

I NEED MORE PSYCHOLOGY PEWD, MORE BOOK REVIEW PLEASE
Got a add to download Twitter lol no joke

The entirety of twitter is just full of proshitters and anticulture that will harrassed ANYONE for liking a certain fictional pairing

I&#39;m back and the ending is so inspirational I have Twitter for the jokes and will delete it soon because everytime you leave out an opinion for example &quot;Money cant fix everything&quot;The whole internet will come after you saying that the keyword &quot;money will bring you temporarily happiness is bs&quot; in my opinion saying that &quot;money will bring you temporarily happiness&quot; I stand with 100% Because money has corrupted humanity and has made everyone feel like money is the key to success But don&#39;t get me wrong It can lead to success depending in how you use that money and how you allow it to change youBut thats besides the point Twitter is toxic and everything pewds says about Twitter in this video is 100% true

POV: you&#39;re conservative person but banned in Twitter for reason like Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Donlad Trump too

I will never use Twitter again...I registered my Twitter account and did nothing (i didnt even open the app) for five days after it. After it i decided to do something, like change my pfp; i open Twitter aaaand... They BANNED ME!!! For no absolute reason! There are frickin pedos, racists, homofobics, and abuse videos ramming around on this frickin social, togheter with the liberty of speech, which is absent, and they just ban my account on which i did nothing other than register myself. Just f*ck Twitter

I am still waiting Pewds for making video about &quot;I Hate Tiktok&quot;...

The king has spoken

<a href="">2:48</a> thank me later

Most of Twitter hates straight people like tf

Fuck ohoff  Twitter

Twitter folks would curse someone and act virtuous the next two minutes

Just watched the video and got a twitter ad....LMAO

Scott Cawthon got cancelled just for TRUMP in twitter. I hate twitter

Twitter is one of the most toxic app in the worlddddddddddddd like wth they spread fake news then other people copies that news then spreads it everywhere then the person that was in the news gets hated and etc etc etc. Like thats messed up lol

I love koo
Pog

Cool

PewDiePie was canceled on Twitter for hating Twitter

I could have never done anything in my life and still be smarter than the people on Twitter

2 years later, I have to read <i>The Nicomachean Ethichs</i> for school, so this video really helps me understand wtf Aristotle is talking about. Thanks!

I swear Twitter is more toxic than you tube and all other social medias

Not getting Twitter
Twitter the most positive place on earth because You can&#39;t even dislike.

its 2021 and this video cannot be any more truer

Twitter is just for fortnite children

Wasn&#39;t expecting a philosophy lesson but I am all here for it

This aged like fine wine .Cheers  to those who deleted their Twitter account.

Twitter Facebook YouTube Twitch    
The thing is, you can’t have an opinion on Twitter without be crucified.

Bruh even Fortnite is less toxic than Twitter

Heck,even Twitter itself cancels you. I made a non harmful joke,and I got my account features limited and my joke was marked as “abuse and harassment.” Honestly,screw Twitter entirely.

Democracy: I don’t agree with u, but I will die for freedom of ur opinionTwitter “democracy”: I don’t agree with you, so I will cancel you and won’t let you say anything

I&#39;m fucking deleting twitter I don&#39;t care if theirs good the good is out wayed by the absolute garbage that lingers on Twitter

Yep, never used Twitter. Never registered an account even once.

Da

Twitter is just if Karen is a social media

@twitter is run by left wing woke types that don&#39;t like the truth.

I don&#39;t even have a twitter account never explored it but I know how shitty system it has

twitter a disgrace

I agree with that because many people are hating anime and criticizing people making anime arts

Twitter be like: you breath, you&#39;re cancelled.

The day I saw someone call Anne Frank a colonized was the day I left Twitter. Shits wild over there

Came for drama, but im walking away feeling enlightened. Great video!

did i just watch a short history lesson? Either way good vid and FUCK TWITTER

You can say whatever you want against Trump butt say anything about AOC or Left wing dorks you get suspended

Back when he used to put actual effort in his contents

This editing style reminds me of Internet historian.

I can&#39;t believe that this video came out from the shitting in the shower guy. This confirms that shitting in the shower does not correlate with virtue.

Me too. I just got suspended because I said the American flag isn&#39;t racist. Yep.

6969 likes and 4200 retweets nice

Well The Comments Are Going To Be Lovely

I’m still waiting for more videos like this

<b>Here after the Nigerian President banned Twitter.</b>

twitter is bad?always has been

wisecrack

Deleted all my socials a while back. I feel more clear-minded, not bombarded by ned discourses every day with shifting opinions.I feel like I can actually think for myself and do what I believe is right, without being harassed and spoken down to.

This biased and colonial mindset platform is soon about to get banned in india....challenging a elected democratic system.

Glad i dont have twitter

Same

Twitter seeing so one make fun of black people: mmmTwitter seeing someone saying &quot;british peoples voices are so funny&quot;: RACIST

Twitterers are the type of people who point out racism but then proceed to categorize what&#39;s for black people and what&#39;s not....

man

Halfway through the video I totally thought I&#39;m watching a Wisecrack video instead of a PewDiePie video.

Why I hate Twitter. Anyway have you ever heard the tragedy of darth Aristoteles the wise?

Well said.

Having a test tomorrow about aristotles

i hate twitter<b>and i fkng got a twitter ad at the start</b>

I never downloaded twitter in my life, that&#39;s makes me a better person.

Ay Twitter is basically YouTube&#39;s reply section

It&#39;s even worse now
Don&#39;t we all

Compare to twitter. Facebook seems a place full of people who respect each other opinion and live as a nice community

You could of just said i quit twitter because its horrible

Why do I want a car? SO I CAN FKN DRIFFTTTT

A year on and he’s still not wrong

came back here after i discovered that twitter clown mods/owners have revoked pewdiepie verification checkmark, cant believe these clowns

This is a very interesting and different type of video! Surprised I didn&#39;t see this before. He should make more of these videos tbh.

And now we got under 18 year old stans great super f$cking great

So many “ratios” on that god awful app. Stupid trend.

Twitter is just a waist of space

Never would think that pewds can teach me that much in under 10 minutes

You can&#39;t spell twitter without twit, guys..

SPA²S=SocratesP=PlatoA=AristotleA=Alexander The Great

I like how people in the comments said they hate Twitter but still use it

I got more out of this than I ever did from social studies can you make another educational video this was also actually entertaining and we also got some advice out of it

I just want Twitter to see how fast I can get canceled

I really love this way of video eddeting

This video is my spirit animal

Such a great video

The one thing I&#39;ll miss is the yearly Eurovision review 

This aged well

I hate twitter bc twitter keeps my account suspended like bruh everytime I create new acc twitter always suspend it

twitter is no brain

I swear these celebrities be hating!!!

Best clickbait I have ever seen. Well done, well played

dork
damn that&#39;s deep

the most informational video in existence

here when people are getting mad at gal gadot for praying for peace

twitter seems like a continuation of high school bullying

Now it makes sense why my parent told me throughout my life to never get a Twitter account

i do too
Hey pewdiepie my dad has twitter please don&#39;t remove it

Big brain
Respects... Twitter is toxic, cancel cultured, garbage

This is such a different video from all your usual content and I love it️

So basically from this video I gathered that if you study philosophy, practice self reflection and wisdom, you will hate twitter.

Here when twitter is trying to cancel Karl Jacobs. For no reason.

Twitter is filled with liberal garbage

thank you pewds i’ve been saying this for so long, twitter is absolute garbage

This is the perfect choice for anyone who lives in 2021. 

1% Twitter 99% greak stuff

I just deactivated my twitter account because of negativity..

new mcyts: imma make my twitter account public, whats the worst that could happenFelix: I was 4 parallel universes ahead of u

The last words will be remembered ofc

I love Philosophy

Me: <b>gets cancelled for breathing</b>

What happens if you delete twitter: Your life extended 69420x better

Twitter is basically the toxic community base if someone is toxic i guarantee they have 70% that they have twitter its like the main villain base

Twitter is a cancer, it shouldn&#39;t define you whether you go to heaven or hell

Never had twitter

Fucken Pëwdiepie man, just stopped me from choking the chicken

Twitter? More like rants.

Kinda funny how this popped up in recommended after DisguisedToast&#39;s &#39;drama&#39;

I deleted mine.
𝘾𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙡 𝙩𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧
This aged to good

Twitter the place where you can’t breathe air otherwise you will get the cancelled sticker that’s how useless the website is

If this came from any other youtuber it would be B.S. but since its pewds we know its honest

people who want attention will get what they deserve eventually

I wonder if somebody posted this on twitter I dont have a twitter so  I will never know

2 years has gone by and still no progress has been made...

Amen.
Today I deleted my Twitter account and YouTube recommend pew die pie It&#39;s really getting dark

At this point I feel like Twitter just needs to die, all the toxicity and drama comes from Twitter where people send death threats to each other every fucking day. People have heated arguments over youtubers streamers music artists and celebrities that should be canceled and it even goes as far as racial discrimination violent insults and exploitations of privacy along with cyber harassments. Twitter has went from a social media for where people can communicate to each other and share posts to this toxic chaotic shithole it is today. It seems like all the issues we have on the internet right now is coming from Twitter and literally no where else.

What you are missing over here Pewds is that eudaimonia in ancient Greece didn&#39;t mean just happiness, an individuals that is, but a whole city&#39;s or country&#39;s happiness through effort from every single member of the society so they can finally live without having to rely on another country&#39;s help or resources

Good decision and prediction

I just came in to see his perspective on Twitter. I came out as a philosipher

“Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” ...- Socrates 430 BC“Fuck Twitter”- Piewdiepie 2020

“War is hell” vs “Twitter is hell”

Man I have got out of Twitter

i have joined the “i hate twitter” gang

Ratio 
With the existence of twitter, people are getting too comfortable of spewing bullshit and hate without getting a punch in the face. I may sound like a boomer here, but holy shit twitter sucks ass.

why can&#39;t we just kill twitter?

I love philosophy. My fav philosopher is Socrates

Again twitter
pewds is an actual intellectual

2021 got recommend by this and I started to think I clicked to the wrong channel.

Deleted my twitter last night after I was feeling like my mental wellness was starting to collapse

I dont understand twitter communities at all , im playing a game called genshin impact and they try to cancel it all time .

Inspiration

<a href="">1:09</a> I almost didn&#39;t realize what was wrong with this picture lol

Felix was ahead of the time

I love when Youtubers use this &quot;essay&quot; type format for thier videos, but damn this is alot to take in.

I am so glad I never used Twitter! I think the website is called Twitter because it turns people into twits!

This video is straight up facts! Preach it PewDiePie!

<b>random things by the internet and books Felix read</b> ... and that is why Pewds hates twitter

PewDiePie: says a random wordMe: What the fuck is that even supposed to mean?

This video was released a long time ago, but I'm feeling a little bad right now, but it helps me. This is just some of my mental wanderings. Thank you, Felix. There are many truths. And as long as you do not go to them, they will not be known to you.
I didn&#39;t have a twitter account, felt good anyways.

the reason why i hate twitter because of some feminist agree with this things like blm lgbtq stop testing on animals etc

I hate twitter even more than I despise the people who use twitter

Guess what, never made a twitter account

Lol ive never been on twitter

<a href="">2:48</a> Deficiency, Getting and spending (major)

Pewdiepie was 10 steps ahead

Lets cancel twitter

“To get from point A to point B,...” *shows Traffic jam.

Twitter sucks-PewdiePie

he should do more kinds of videos like this

Twitter 
Pewdiepie is now an English teacher.

the people who dislike are the ones from twitter

Just be an overall good person

Me too

well, i don&#39;t know about other people not from my country (i&#39;m living in Russia), what they thinking about Twitter, but for me, it&#39;s on the contrary salvation, i mean, my life and entire lifes of everyone here is a damn hell, and twitter help me to not lose my mind and my soul, because i&#39;ve seen all this shit in twitter and realise others society have a problems and inadequate people too, and seeing all this bullshit make me a little more calm down and relaxed and i&#39;m just laughing and healing my nerves.

Twitter and its users are literally the biggest scum on the planet

Come for the hate of Twitter Stay for the life lesson

You know you are f*cked when the biggest youtuber says that he hates you

And tiktok too

I came here for the memes..I stayed for the philosophy lesson!!

I&#39;m unironically asking this :Is 4chan better than twitter ? Like if you were to choose between the 2, which one would you choose ?Why ? Not just talking about /b/ or /pol/ but about 4chan as a whole.

I hate Twitters customer service its terrible.  Their bots block you because THEY read a tweet incorrectly, then leave you hanging for weeks.  Shockingly bad customer service

Old way cancel culture : The subject gets further from virtue, and embracing the act as a people&#39;s villain insteadModern day cancel culture : The subject either changes to being more virtue, or stop spreading their vicebut but but but tWiTtEr cAnCeL cUwtUrE bAdlove you pewds but this ain&#39;t it.

Like the great Charles White said &quot;Twitter is the place where happiness and fun goes to die&quot;

Twitter probably caused corona once you think about it.

Wait until 2021
Good thing I never had and never will

I am gonna cancel you on Twitter dot com for this

Just got suspended from twifter,feeling good

So true. I&#39;m pewds fan ️
Is there a playlist for this kinds of videos?

wish this had a better title, like &quot;how to fix your life and delet twitter&quot; this is literally one of your greatest and most helpful videos and I avoided it because of the clickbaityness of the title, keep up the good work you absolute saint :)

Another reason media sucks is that it takes up storage when u don’t have a SIM card and when you have a broken battery 

i cant beileve you are the same guy that played bayonetta 2 like that

Pewds was so ahead of his time

well self help was figured out before ancient greece even

Didn&#39;t know Felix was head of the junior philosophy club at high school

What the fuck dose twitter do with this

Even Tik Tok is better than Twitter

Water is blue

69 likes and I&#39;ll delete twitter... not even kidding.Edit: Fuck it. I&#39;m deleting it anyway.

Quora is much better than twitter in general, try it yourself

I feel like twitter lost it&#39;s charm once it became just a cease pool for people to just complain , like I understand if you want express your true feelings but there are better ways to do that, like y&#39;know, writing in a diary, that helps

i like how smoothly he transitioned to philosophy and just continued with it lol

Twitter is just a toxic wasteland

Yep twitters a cesspool where everyone just gotten used to force feeding each other their own shat

Twitter,what is Twitter?all i know is Twittard!

based pewd

To understand it better δαίμονας in Greek means demon when you put an ευ it becomes ευδαιμονία, which is the one demon-less.

i got twitter to find new friends and i ended up just meeting the most disgusting and annoying people i’ve ever met. they put on fronts like they’re amazing people who care a lot for their friends and then you get invited to their group chat and they all treat you like shit,, they are some of the hardest people to get along with

Ngl pewdipie is clever af

This video is underrated

5 months was enough for me to delete that shithole.Never using it again.

I too hate Twitter. It is the worst network I have experience. Twitter must die. It must be destroyed.

This is good choice

Read The Bible and follow in the good Lords footsteps. Then everything will sense ASAP Felix..

Swedish man spittin bandage.
Mohammed is on there as well so it&#39;s time to leave Twitter for good

Even my mom hates twitter.

TWITTCRAP SUCKS

this sounds like a Vsauce video

pewds is so smart and intelligent.

I accidentally deleted my twitterAND ITS WORTH IT

Here after ksi
Youtube just recommended that today lol

Pewds being serious scares me

World be much better without twitter and tiktok

I really needed to see this video once again. Hope I&#39;ll make it through this time.

Not understood your video
I just use twitter to send my screenshots from my switch

This really applies now

Who&#39;s here after mc stans tried cancelling KSI and he left Twitter as well

Forgot this was Pewds

man was ahead of his time, now twitter is even worse

I rewatched this video after KSI left Twitter. Still, fuck Twitter. Never actively use that platform since 2012ish

Honestly I&#39;d be for Felix having a podcast just for like random serious ramblings

This is like a pewdiepie commentary video

Twitter is like facebook

Do not argue with an idiot. He will pull you down and beat you with experience. -Phantom Forces, Roblox

I learned more valuable things here than in my philosophy class

Start of the video: “I hate Twitter.”End of the video: “That is the key to happiness.”What

Who’s here after ksi deleted his Twitter too

whats the background music for this

Damn bruh I was studying jurisprudence and read the Socrates theory

Got recommended to me after KSI left twitter

If i had the money to buy twitter i’d fucking delete it

I legit never actually had Twitter

hey pewdiepie can u mention the professor who was explaining (btw nice explaining I felt I was watching an educational video lol)

Damn he was so ahead of his time, its insane. Jj left last week, who could be next?

this was made during the birth of Twitter Nonsense.He was ahead of all of us.

Seriously twitter is so toxic..No explanation needed

i expected to laugh but i’m just very impressed by felix big brain knowledge

this aged like beer, it aged well

I deleted twitter, but before I did, I dm&#39;d a racist stan, and sent them a very kind message in the form of a meme, &quot;You have no bitches&quot; :)

I’m probably never going to touch the “download” button

Who&#39;s here after KSI left Twitter.

&quot;Twitter is bad&quot;<b>Hmm yes the floor is made out of floor</b>

As long as Twitter will exist, this video will always be relevant

Who else is here cuz YouTube suggested it after KSI reddit video?

Video hits after revisiting it a year later

is this pewds or vsause?he started from twitter and went on to talk about greek philosophers i have never studied( i am greek btw)

Well Twitter is like a super power if you don&#39;t like it just leave, it&#39;s sad...

whos here after the ksi twitter controversy

Felix hated Twitter before it was cool

Gimmie the golden memeThis aint a request

Me who never had twitter :-D

Remember  when pewds use to be toxic now great guy donates to charity he kind he delete Twitter  and he changed so much

Twitter is run by scum. Censored and massively in favour of corrupt regimes around the world. It really should be left to die.

1word K-pop

can’t believe Twitter is still like this

Never actually cared for Twitter. You may applaud now.

This aged well

The 6.3k people that disliked are 13 yo white girls

Came from Pegasus&#39; vid . Dunno how I missed this one

same

Me who has never used twitter: I can&#39;t imagine living thereAlso me: I know what happens in there

good

same

You changed me I&#39;m gonna delete it
How many of u r here after KSI leaving  Twitter... [Poor guy, I feel sry for him]

Been thinking about quitting twitter. But this would be detrimental to my brand. Without it I cannot communicate with my supporters and find commissions for design. So

U and KSI made the right choice lmao

KSI quits twitter .

Who’s here after KSI quits twitter lmao

Ι never had twitter and i dont intend to.

tbh twitter was always a toxic place, from the &quot;edgy&quot; Leafy fans, to the minecraft youtuber/kpop stans and the pronouns weirdos.also its a fking mess with the politics shitall of them are weird and they&#39;ll do anything whatever the person they &quot;stan&quot; saysin other words just don&#39;t use twitter at all it&#39;ll just ruin your day

This video needs comment ok KSI

Most of the cancel culture is from white 14 year olds. Basically miniature Karens.

Type of rant video u could learn from

a year later and this is still true

Ksi bring me here 

Here after KSI leave twitter

This is a great video  And Twitter is probably the most toxic platform on the internet.

Ksi leaving too

i can&#39;t delete an account i never had<b>twitter</b>

Ksi deleted twitter as well

Right Now KSI quits Twitter. Twitter evolving, just backwards

I came here after KSI mentioned Felix quitting twitter today

In short PewDiePie quits twitter
Bro make more videos like this they’re so good

just wow!

Happy to see Their is no Right vs left fighting in comments

dislikes are people who cancel him

What does it say, I don't know English
A Burden disposed of, But i couldn&#39;t dispose of a problem i luckily don&#39;t possess.

Dumb bird, dumb fucking bird. It&#39;s offended

I created my own happiness by writing something offensive which resulted in my Twitter account being permanently suspended.

I went on Twitter for the first time when I was 11-12 in late 2009-2010 and thought it was boring. Flash forward a few years later it’s a toxic ground

Twitter please, just end cancel culture

I didn&#39;t see this until now and was wondering wtf happend to his twitter account

o

aged like fine wine

I can&#39;t believe that this is the same guy who talks to beetroots. lmfao

absolute mad lad!!!

Dislikes are toxic Twitter people

<a href="">0:11</a> is that really Felix&#39;s tweet???

Please make more of these

Imagine having a Twitter account, LoL

Never had Twitter. This is exactly why. At best, you get some likes for a picture of your dog or a quote. At worst, you end up getting yelled at for not having an unpopular opinion.

He explained reinforcement learning so beautifully. He is a Madlad

I just got suspended from Twitter for a joke and I immediately came back to this video

I use twitter to follow artists because downloading pics from twitter is easy and hd. That&#39;s the worth of twitter for me.

Yea, can I have a Summoning Salt video with a side of PewDiePie and a sprinkle of twitter hate?

Just deactivated Twitter and felt huge relief, it’s so addictive though, soooo toxic.

I got my account suspended for arguing with someone who was defending a killer

I left twitter because they suspend my other accounts for no reason

So confused, he started talking about all the flaws in and problems with twitter then gave me a lesson about ancient Greek philosophy

Do, do not tell.
This man predicted the future

Me too

I dont do social media such garbage
Me: HiPerson: EW A CIS GIRL, YOUR JUST A BOY IN A GIRLS OUTFITMe: wait what ? What did I do? Person: Your cis Me: But I support trans people my best friend is a trans boy and I support him and protect him from transphobic peopl-Person: doesn’t matter your a cis girl and that’s disgusting Me: bruh it’s not my fault that I’m cis, I didn’t ask to be born with a uterus Person: Shut up cis girlMe: Sigh what did I do?

I don&#39;t even have Twitter and yet the mention of it makes me sick

The reason for me why Twitter is so bad is because it&#39;s so overwhelming. There&#39;s so many opinions clashing together that even if you know what&#39;s right the wrong just always somehow finds a reason to make them also right.

reason i dont even have twitter account

I learned so much.

Deleted my Twitter account and deleted the app. In China and in the West now people are canceled not because they did anything particularly hateful, but because they questioned Communist ideology. Wake up! Communists wear a mask of compassion ... until they seize power.

I follow video game and manga/anime stuff so I&#39;m fine with that area of Twitter.

I&#39;ve seen some pretty toxic people in the comments of YouTube- but Twitter makes these YouTube trolls look like Albert Einstein in comparison. Twitter is officially the birthplace of Karens, political wars, transphobia, sexism. Just <b>everything</b> bad. YouTube seems to have some degree of civilisation

i hate twitter,they can f.... ...

This is why Pewdiepie should’ve won the 100mil sub battle

This is so relevant in 2021 cancel culture.  17 people cancelled in 2021 already.  It’s been TWO MONTHS!!

I thought this was about twatter.

This guy could be a philosopher.

&gt; Solved by aristotle&gt; shows bust of platokek

I deleted Twitter. I hate the BS that’s going on.

Make more of these poodie

TikTok = twitter 2?

This video really helps me, thanks pewds

I disagree with the idea that it’s happiness we look for. I’d say there is a deeper thing we look for which is meaning in life. Happiness and meaning also aren’t the same thing.

This is the most chad video I ever seen

Man, looking at Twitter now, this video is ten times more relatable.

twitter is so goddamn toxic

This video puts me on a mood. I&#39;ve watched it 5 times and I still don&#39;t know what that is...

No thank you, i will go with golden MEME instead.

same goes for tiktok

i love twitter, its like a cyber war, i love the chaos

&quot;What happens when we unlock 100% brain capacity?&quot;&quot;100%?&quot; [Thinks of this video]

Delete your Twitter and Facebook accounts folks. You WILL be happier ..

So you,re changing from hatred to Twitter to ancient greek philosophy Well that escalated quickly

I really just want to bash the Twitter peoples heads into a rock

Not even Bob the builder can fix Twitter. I wanted Twitter once but now I&#39;m in a relief I changed my mind and achieved Facebook instead.

Came to see him talk about twitter, became a philosopher

Twitter so toxic Glad I don&#39;t use the app anymore

more videos like this pls

from me to you i say fuck twitter

Can we talk about gina carano or get you thoughts on the topic PEWDS

People be canceling people for speaking their native language now.. <b>*cough*</b> Quackity

I just recently made a Twitter account haven’t been using it for the past two weeks. I got on Twitter 3 days ago and my account is randomly suspended for no apparent reason and I sent them an appeal form. They didn’t respond back to me and now I want to delete my Twitter account, but I can’t since it’s still suspended. 

this is why I will NEVER get a Twitter account

This still holds up today

Is this a legitimate, meaningful and mature video essay on a platform full of toxicity?

I hate twitter and feel like deleting it all the time, there&#39;s so many angry people on there , people can never agree or debate on anything without blocking/slander. There&#39;s so much hypocrisy that goes on there and if you do something &quot;wrong&quot; people will find you and harass you forever and twitter won&#39;t do anything about it even if it gets reported. It&#39;s a trash site and making people more toxic and divided

In a few years the sentence: &quot;I hate twitter&quot; will be racist...

I like posting mainly my art and retweeting from people i follow but aside from that? As long as I stay away from the general feed page im good

We all do now felix, we all do.

I hate Twitter to

You fuking bastard i no longer respect you i was proud when making fun of me being a simp but this u bastard

I deleted my Twitter account again and This time I won’t go back to many fake ass people in there they love to make up lies about people just to get Attention It’s horrible they made up lies about me they were Posting deformation of character about me it was Horrible I just had to delete it and Ignorant people were believing it, I am Innocent, fuck Social media.

Underrated review

Twitter the land of toxicity

Wait wasn&#39;t this vedio about Twitter?

bruh i should be revising for philosophy rn but i guess i don’t need to cus pewds is teaching me 

Now i see why u hate Twitter pewds. Its filled with some sensitive and in the same time dumb people

I recently entered Twitter and I have been wearing a gas mask the whole time

<a href="">0:11</a> I literaly adore Pewds

Twitter is OBSESSED with white people

I delated twitter and no joke I felt 10 times better over the last month

Pewds dropping that Greek philosophy knowledge!

Just wait

I love that thumbnail image

good for felix

Understandable
Understandable
Starghit White Men: <b>exists</b>Twitter:<b>so you have chosen....death</b>

I completely forgot this was about Twitter until he said it at the end.

This is even more true today. Fuck twitter.

IM HERE ONCE AGAIN TO ASK FOR THE DAMN BACKGROUND MUSIC

I tried going there to see if it&#39;s true. But I forgot to wear a hazmat suit.

Pewds will never know it but he just helped me with my philosophy class right now with this video

Wisdom of the centuryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!Lovely
Indeed

I shit on twitter. But i shit on pewds too. What do you say to that?

this is probably my favorite pewdiepie video, it was coincidentaly released on my birthday

This is the time pewdepie really got the moment of 9000 iq

v souce 4
I thought I was at the wrong channel, forgot this was Pewdiepie

I watch this video all the time

Twitter is one of the reasons I lost hope in humanity and became very apathetic

Why does he look so much like Seth Everman in the thumbnail?

You must read (I recommend) &quot;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning&quot; written in 1946 by Victor Frenkel, who is the founder of logotherapy.  And of course Rene Descartes&#39; classic, &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; he was heavily influenced by Plato. He is a wonderful rationalist.I hope you enjoy and wait :)

Title: I hate twitterVideo: lesson on Greek philosophy...I LOVE IT

Now he&#39;s getting cancelled for a joke

went from &quot;twitter stinky&quot; to talking about philosophy and virtue in depth

This aged well...

Good thing I didnt create a twitter account

I&#39;m not suppose to give my opinion about it but this is the type of video worthy of youtube&#39;s best. Not minecraft videos.

Good thing I don&#39;t care about twitter, I&#39;m just there for the art (I usually don&#39;t read the comments there, just like and move on with my life XD)

now he cant get canceled

We all do.
This taught me more that school ever could

and now it comes back to try and cancel him again

Homeostasis means a person and the best full potential

now twitter drama and most of techno&#39;s old vids are gone nice niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :(

I never had a Twitter and never will, thanks Pewds️.

<a href="">0:00</a>-<a href="">0:02</a> and <a href="">7:06</a>-<a href="">7:10</a> out of context is hilarious

i just say my opinions on twitter to piss people off

Alexander the great sucks all he did in his life was fight, kill and conquer he wasn&#39;t even the guy who covered the highest land ever so he aint that big of a deal @PewDiePie

true

same i hate twitter
the wisest man on the internet is also the meme lord

By now twitter is the more popular 4-chan.why

My boy pewdiepie knows a lot about history

I do too!
I must find the golden meme

Twitter is more toxic than venuses atmosphere

Pews doing reverse face reveal before it became mainstream

<b>&quot;Finally told my parents they&#39;re gay️‍&quot;</b>hahahahha

“I hate twitter”<b>talks about ancient greek mythology</b>

This aged well

This is now relevant

Pewdiepie Teach Better Philosophy in 7 minutes and 13 seconds than My Teacher in the whole semester.

Good that you deleted your twitter acc before it took too much of a heavy toll on you

Is like a huge gas chamber

I have Twitter, but i never had a problem with it since everyone ignores my Tweets

Twitter: a place full of miserable sjw women

I have problem with Twitter t don’t send me the code when I create account

Shame on bias liberal  Twitter  now has suspended Catholic World Report&#39;s account because the Catholic publication referred to Biden&#39;s transgender nominee as “a biological man identifying as a transgender woman.” Twitter said those words were a violation of Twitter rules “against hateful conduct.” Catholic World Report will not be allowed to tweet from its account unless it deletes the message that Twitter opposes. It’s time Big Tech loses its section 230 protection. Shame on liberal bias run Twitter and Jack Dorsey what a liberal bias jackass.

twitter is bad for mental health.

Adolf &quot;Jack Dorsey&quot; Twitler loves censorship these days.

was this before his face reveal?

This video makes me wanna study Criticism rn.

Twatter

Pewds: I hate TwitterMe: doesn’t anyone with a brain hate Twitter?

When Felix uses his brain cell

I agree with this so much and just social media in general it’s rotting everyone’s brains and causing hate just day to day life you can see it’s affects on everyone and how anti social the REAL world is now

What does this have to do with twitter?

Best Pewdiepie video ive ever seen, more of this.

twitter makes me lose faith in Mankind

Aged like fine wine

PewDiePie was ahead of his time. 2020 - 2021 is like Twitter came to life.

when i was on twitter, i always felt uneasy tbh...bcs so much negative tweets!! not to mention the kpop community. so much negativity and fanwars going on there. thats the reason i stopped using twitter, and it made me feel SO much better.

who came here after twitter going to get cancelled

Pewdiepie was ahead of the game

SO THIS IS WHAT WHEN YOU WENT FROM SCREAMING AT THE SCREEN PLAYING MOVING NUMBERS THING IN DISGUISE EVERYDAY FOR YEARS FOR A AUDIENCE THROUGH A DEVICE THEN READING ANCIENT PHILOSPHY AND HUNDRED OF MORE BOOKS AND REALIZING ITS WAS ALL BONKERS AND SO YOU RANT ABOUT IT XD

Right for me the toxic site is tiktok

4200 retweets and 6969 likes.

I’m happy to be me.

The virtuous turn virtual.

Twitter is a CP farm. Guard your children.

i created an account yesterday, even tho I&#39;ve watched this video, i guess i finally understood the shit going on in there and deleted it literally the next day.

Look Twitter just deleted my account ass I violated because I broke Twitter rules so I hate it and I will delet my account

I want to delete my twitter account but it got suspended. Now I can’t delete it

I would delete twitter but the drama is sometimes funny on there

I was expecting a rant on Twitter, not a lesson on philosophy. And I&#39;m not complaining

When you have little to no idea what he&#39;s talking about but watch anyway &#39;cause it&#39;s entertaining

He is serious

Twitter needs to put a dislike ratio for delusional people.

I hate weibo
here after trump got banned
I fucking hate twitter

This was unexpectedly deep. Very interesting stuff that I hadn&#39;t really thought of too much.

The greatest irony in virtue signalling is that pointing it out is a more subliminal version of itself and you basically end up getting caught in it. to me virtue signalling is gaint fucking onion with endless layers.

Twitter is racist bro

I came back to this video, to cheer up in a 3rd world country falling apart

I just watched this and i feel like 10 times smarter. Good job Pewdiepie!!!

Never had twitter.

~I cannot stand it and was never on it~why?~ego does nothing to anyone in the whole Universe~does it now?~but to those out there and do not wish to be awakened into Buddha self~stay with your ego~and keep dreaming in Maya~oh yes you love your followers there while you are following yourself~they have a name for that called Sheeple~

thank you felixand i agree twitter is filled with drama and negativity if you say something you are gonna make someone mad and then somebody else gets mad and the cycle keeps going on there are the people who believe in what they believe but have to shove it down somebody else’s throat and you can’t be neutral on anything “you like kpop? you are trash”“ you hate kpop? kill yourself”there is no middle ground you can’t have an opinion and that is twitter

Twitter=Toxic.

Youtube facebook twitter all are same ......... Boycott all of them........put an end to their monopoly.......And most importantly put a ban on these  organization on acquiring smaller tech organization and startups...........

guys i was trolling twitter users today and someone said twitter &gt; reddit and that i was a pewdiepie and elon musk fanboy if i said otherwise‍️

seriously, never go on twitter

Great video

i am greek and i have to say that now i feel happy

Ok since I don’t see any comments about this in case you don’t understand what his is saying he is saying that to be virtuous you don’t do good things just to be virtuous you do it because it makes you happy and that how you become virtuous not because you want to but because it makes you happy

Damn... Aristotle could cancel anyone lol.

Trump is with him now

I agree Pewds Twitter even tried to cancel my favourite youtuber animator called &quot;TheOdd1sOut&quot; just for a fucking joke. These twitter kids cant even stand a joke

can someone tell me the background song to this video?

Deleting Twitter is the best decision I ever did in my life :D

Pewds should make more videos like this!

Who’s here from pegasus

Twitter is stupid.

Twiter is Toxic as hell.Tbh i use it sometimes, But i hate it at the same time.

im from the future idiots in twitter are moving to youtube to spread fucking politics beware my friend they also argue like that in real life

And I Hate you

Twitter is dead.Trump is going to take so many users away from that platform all that will be left are Trans Nazis who are into minor love.Who likes being fact checked by people who encouraged over 150 days of riots.They can F right off.....

Pffffft abandon twitter return to discord fam  join the cool kids

After Trump this is even deeper than before.

when Im done checking twitter I always feel so bad .. its a time waster soul consumer brain washer  EVIL Im quitting twitter too

Me expecting another rang about some random drama.Me getting a philosophy lesson instead.e n l í g h t

QUIT TWITTER

Yes. Add the censorship and the double standards and this adds to the dumpster fire of a social media site.

Thanks for the lesson papa

Mainstream media is so lame

It starts &quot;i hate twitter&quot; and end in describing &quot;what is the meaning of life&quot;.

It was freaking cool ..

Saitama should one punch twittcrap

Twitter is better than Facebook or tiktok :)

I listen to this video so much because it helps me control my suicidal thoughts

I was just looking for some shitposting about cringey tweets

Dear god don’t get me started on those kpop and Ariana stans.

true

I suffocate when I visit twitter. Literally. And physically.

Dont we all

I use twitter to relieve my stress and anger on other people I know it&#39;s dumb but it&#39;s a good way to relieve stress and worst thing is got banned from twitter 10 times amlnd my account got suspended for my acts so I started another

Bruh, i did&#39;nt realize this was pewds until 5 mins into the vid.

Me on twitter: last active 3 years agoMe returning: what in gods name happened here, i was gone for 3 years an then now it looks like boston harbor fallout4

Hurray !! A shout out to @Hex_Hacker09 got my account unbanned and working

i came here expecting some shitting on twitter, ended up having existential dread

Don’t we all?
twitter is utterly useless

Twitter is like bigger MHA fandom, toxic shit

10/10 video

instead of deleting just twitter delete all your social media accounts and maybe except youtube. it does have many flaws but it could be good if used the right way and your time on it is limited/managable because it actually isnt a 100% complete waist of time

guys did you know that twittcrap bans people for no reason

Never doubts @Hex_Hacker09 via !G helped me restore back my account

Twitter people is starting to cancel popular people like Mrbeast,Theodd1sout,etc.... Beacause they&#39;re being toxic

its actually cool to get history lessons from Felix based on Greek Philosophy through controversy (social media)

End of 2020 and this Video somehow applies to todays Twitter just as it did back then if not better!

Hex_hacker09 ️n InsTa did a successful unlock for me, Go hire him for help 

i hate twitter why? because the fuccccing tweets limkt

Me=GoodYou=Bad

So glad I grew up with this: FAnd not this: T

tfw you never had a twitter

is this pewdiepie

twitter is a joke. I just got suspended for 12 hours for responding to &quot;What do we do with the Supreme Court&quot; with &quot;hang them all in the mall&quot; as a joke  This got me suspended. Laughingly saying to &quot;hang&quot; all the Supreme Court justices &quot;in the mall&quot; gets you suspended.  twitter is run by children.

Same

this banger is 1 year old

Almost a year since this thing came out and I’m barely watching it

Video starts at <a href="">7:10</a>

We all do
But Twitter love you :)

Even facebook is better than Twitter.

GREAT SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW TOXIC AND DISGUSTING TWITTER IS

I&#39;m half way through a philosophy degree and this is a good rundown of virtue ethics  great stuff.

This statement still stands to this day and probably even forever.

Is happiness our function or is it survival?

This say a lot about society

I&#39;m thinking about deleting my twitter account, wish me luck !

But why would you want to be happy? Now isn&#39;t that a good philosophical question 

i need more of these videos pls

Although 90% of Twitter is toxic there are some good Twitter accounts out there.

i have one word to say about twitter.“Toxic”

CNN &amp; NPR &amp; BBC &amp; CBS News &amp; abc news &amp; CNBC news &amp; NBC News &amp; MSNBC &amp; New York Times &amp; Washington post &amp; Facebook &amp; Twitter &amp; Google &amp; Yahoo &amp; Amazon &amp; Instagram &amp; TikTak &amp; etc...=Disaster,Globalist,Antifa,BLM,US Democratic party,Communist(Socialist),Feminist,Islamist,Lier,Dishonest,Supporter of terrorism &amp; terrorists,Criminal,Anti-freedom,Anti-justice,Inhuman

negative
I was not expecting this content, but I’m all for it

This will always be relevant

we have two sides on twitter:the sensitive 13 year old girlsandthe people who fight the 13 year old girls

Twitter&#39;s services are horribleThey don&#39;t acknowledge their user&#39;s help request anymore 

Don’t forget the part where Mark Listens to us.

This Just turned into a lesson half way through.

it still suck actually

Twitter can actually be a really useful app if &quot;cancel culture&quot; never fucking existed.

And people where freaking out on twitter over a animal crossing hairstyle

Twittcrap: exists

Me: ah, So this is why thonas wanted to snap half of the population

I bet you, if social media is still a thing in 100 years, the next Twitter of that generation will judge people because of the air they breathe.

Just to be clear, Twitter&#39;s biggest problems are the toxic people who use it. The website itself is still a functional tool that can bring about good when used by rational beings.

am using this video to help with a seepch in school

Don&#39;t we all

Me who is sitting here wondering what the song is

Facebook is worse in the same way

I hate twitter!!!  I nevet had one !

What about Parler?

that was nice

This was such a good video, I really want to see more stuff like this from pewds. I would love a podcast or something from pewds on this kind of stuf

This age well

i actually do my assignment on philosophy using this video

this man is woke

Me too

This video is even more relevant now

Guys stop making hate comments about Twitter, I&#39;m getting tired of liking them all.

I hate them too, all those bullshit media! Brainwashing people! Controling people and even election. Don’t respect democracy and freedom of speech at all! But who made them rich? We the people! But in their eyes,we are just fool,can be easily controled!

This is why I find platforms like Reddit, Plozee, Quora better. Less toxic. Fb, Twitter are garbage

I thought this was going to be a video where he starts with something like “ctyjzsfvjokjdfniimh” but it was way more different than I though

<a href="">0:37</a>Double nice
This is the real and what we should learn in school, Great job Felix for educating everyone who have watched this motivation and educational video!

Aristotle was just looking for the perfect human
