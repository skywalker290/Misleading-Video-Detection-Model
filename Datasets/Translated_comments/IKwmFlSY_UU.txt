I understand how much hard work you put into this film looks amazing

Is the flim 13+ tell me

He is different about Vikram Bhatt movies
How much hard work you have to do, friend.
This is going to be one of the greatest horror Bollywood movie !! Even before it&#39;s release I&#39;m waiting for the other ones in the franchise....

All the efforts invested in making a movie is a movie itself.

Huge respect for VICKY 🙌🙌🙌
Literally there is a many efforts to make this film.gbu them.n hope this movie will get lot amount of money on box office 👏👏👏😌😌💕💕💕😄

Congrats for The movie To Your Team

Really Vicky survived a lot...<a href="">#salute</a> to Vicky

The success of this movie will mostly depend on the sound......sound will be the key.....take my words......Dolby Atmos has the power to create any environment and if they used it effectively and release this movie in dolby atmos in every theatre in india then keep my words it will be a blockbuster.....otherwise it will be like a normal horror movie....baseless.

&quot;Exams are getting ovee on 20 feb , feeling damn lucky , gonna watch on 21&quot;😁😁

I wish this movie is not related to Hollywood movie Ghost ship (2002)

i feel this movie wont earn as much as it can due to students exam i am one of them

<a href="">

Cheers frm a mariner

Do you expect any Indian actors and directors to talk in Hindi language???
You all are ashamed for speaking in Hindi.
Its that true story 😥

Bas last me tantrik ko mat bulna nai to ye phir se Bollywood style ki ho jayegi.

Cant wait!!!!! Good luck Vicky &amp; team!!!!❤️❤️❤️👍👍
Wowwww😍I watch this movie first day first show

Kuch bhe 13 stich what man thoda kum  bolo

Where is bhumi pednekar??

waiting for this movie.. it will be an awesome one

What a hardwork and dedication by Vicky!!!!!!!LOVE UUUU!!!!

Support <a href="">

How much waste can I do...I will look at the reviews and decide...what kind of garbage movies are being made these days?
What i just watch part 1 <a href="">3:10</a>

Is the story of the film real?

Grammar wise, shouldn’t title say “Trapped ON the Haunted Ship” ?

The good thing is that there is no song in this movie otherwise other horror movies have songs in it dont put songs in horror movies 😂😂

It will break all records

So Karan Johar Nade shit movie Content but Very Nice Netflix ContentNow he is doing the reverse

Is this ship still there on the Juhu beach or was it again made for d movie ???

Hollywood level

damm u guys used a audiojungle copyright BGM, dude please send it to us will purchase the music for u guys

13 stitches!😬🤐🤫🤭😦😧😟😕
Safety first

Who watches horror movies like toko 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Atleast Buy the BG Track. You can clearly hear &quot;Audio Jungle&quot; at 1.21

Whose exams will be like this, mine is also there and I would not have seen this movie.
Part one ====&gt;&gt; 2020 Part two ====&gt;&gt; 2022 maybe

👻 🚢👆Translate this Emojis in word and u will find the real source of movie

Everything is good but name....😰

The movie better be good!

vicky nailed it.. because only he can do

Best part is no cringe songs in between

Every seamens nightmare is an old ship.. now kushal is stuck on that and he dosent know when his contract is gonna finish.

Movie's language HindiAnd rest of the time EnglishChutiya log
Please subscribe my channel 🙏🙏 i need ur support

The most scary movie

Chutiya movie hogi k lelo. Not made for bollywood horror movie.
Dying to watch 🙆

Bhai, you log in to India, I feel free to speak Hindi, I am proud to be an Indian friend.
What kind of movie is there?... What kind of cinematography.. or storyline... Hopefully there is no love story.
Why you let us know nobody gives a fuck everone know its a business

Am I the only one jissey trailer dekh k darr nahi laga?😂

After bigg boss..

Atkeast Bollywood is now experimenting !! Loved d idea ... Even though a good English movie with similar theme came long back

Watch another person's video completely Karen Because the watch time of the video will be full What is the benefit of making a video?
I got this parmish verma in my thumb nail.
Theres so much behind the scenes.. thats why do not criticise unless its really bad..  *student of the year 2 ahem ahem

Yar exams ke bad release karte na..

Vicky kausal is setting new goals for other actors

This movie is a challenge to the horror story... 👍👍
Please release the movie on 21 march because my exam&#39;s are ending on 20th March please I want to see it&#39;s first show

<a href="">

Dedication will pay off....hatsoff vicky

What are you watching Hollywood movies??? Everything English can explain is still there.
Brother Hollywood, are you in Bollywood or are you all a citizen of India….to kripeya Dharma production people insist on Hindi.
Saale angrej de bachhe .........saaleyo sadi rashtra bhasha hindi aaa........
They shouldn&#39;t have revealed that it&#39;s a studio, not an actual ship. At least not now.

Its something new and great . And ya its a bollywood movie which is truly horror .

Looks like Karan Johar's mind is in the right place.
Non Dharma - Dharma film . 👏This kinda publicity/promotion is better than nonsense social media interviews silly games etc .  tiredness comes easy to acknowledge on actor&#39;s faces

When you&#39;re having a Stairing contest with a Doll AND YOU WIN....

These types of movies makes us feel like bollywood is growing.. ❤

Also feel few comments are paid comments , i didn&#39;t see anything exciting but vicky&#39;s and crew efforts .

It's a copy of Ghost Ship.
Going to watch this movie for sure

This movie is going to be big hit man. congratulations to vickey

Vicky Kaushal so super and intelligent actor

Waiting for this movieOnly for Vicky and his efforts.....In fact a lot of efforts.......even in his painDefinitely gono watch this movie in theatre for that experience.......lots of love for Vicky

If you want to listen to real horror stories then quickly click on the photo of my channel.

Hopefully yeh movie revolution laigi horror genre mehBut bc mera boards ka exam rahega😭

Sisters, release the complete film slowly.
They are giving very much efforts.

Vicky khaushal expression are actually so real I feel when I was seeing taliar is that Vicky khaushal is not doing acting it feels like he is naturally doing hats of to him to do this natural acting and make this movie more scary and feel like their is real bhoot

Puri movie hi daaldo na youtube pe
Lol so now Bollywood started to copy the games too  “the dark pictures anthology man of medan”’ 🤣🤣🎮

I am getting curious about this movie after watching every single clips of this film

If you are thinking of subscribing to your brother smjh please do so 😭❤️❤️❤️
If this film works it would be such a breakthrough in indian film industry...as people will thrive for such unique stories....encouraging others to try out and explore different story!

The work they do in term of sets and thier dedication towards shoot  and everything sets to be in screen and what we do we just criticize them thats it

I wish fl2 k romantic scenes naa ho 🤐
Tumbbad is legendary movie of all time ❤Wanted one more movie like tumbbad

Non drama ..drama film

Maren ge sab ke sab🤢🤢🤢🧟​
This might be not on conjuring 2 level but it will be one of the best Hindi horror movie atleast without any sex.

bhoot: how&#39;s the josh?vicky:  aage se nahi hoga sir maff kardo

This movie is going to be super duper hit

<a href="">1:46</a> ok so now for marketing a Dharma film you need to claim that it&#39;s like a Dharma Film 😂😂

But , Tumbbad is Masterpiece

<i>Har din thora thora kr K full movie dikha doge kya</i>  trailer me hi😂😂😂😂

U guys have done an amazing job ..😊😊😊

Imagine if director would be KARAN JOHAR😅😅

The movie is biggest horror movie of all time in india

Hume totally horror story movie, masala tadka nahi chahiye hum Vicky ji liye hi theater jai ge maybe movie achi ho.
Bhoot exists ,yes Just behind u ,someone is there ,u can&#39;t see . But someone is watching u every moment. Now turn off the lights ,and peeche to  dekho ,m not joking ,meri 3 saal pehle bike accident Mai maut ho chuki hai ,yes ,we exists

Just hats off to the team and especially Vicky.

Only disadvantage it will have  is due to  it&#39;s release date .most students who are eager to watch it , are having their exam like me.Apart from it , it&#39;s gonna set a bar for other horror movies.The trailer was too scary compared to others.
