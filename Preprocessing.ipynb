only one that got really uncomfortable when he was spinning the phone around in his hand over the edge at <a href=\"\">6:38</a>2020: galaxy s20 ultra2022: galaxy s20 ultra instinct2025: galaxy s20 god modei'm ready to pre-order the ultra, trading in my note 10 plus. i like the 5g speed i'm getting on my oneplus 7t 5g mclaren and i can't wait to see this massive 6.9\" screen!or you could get a nice s6 or s7 and an amazing camera for photoswhen people expected for s11, samsung made s20 :di am going for the s20+ because i think after awhile with having the ultra that huge camera bump will start to annoy the heck out of me but this is making me leave my pixel to retirepeople need to stop throwing money at flagships. $1400 for a phone that will be topped in a year is stupid. at this point smart phones are commodities. the flagships dont actually net you anything than luxury and brand. mind you, you can buy a used s9 for sub $200 pretty easily.why the fuck arent your videos doing 60fps?just give a thicker phone and remove the camera bumps? could have been a 6000 amp battery they are already so thin k with a case sure it would be way to thick but not every one is so unlucky or stupid to drop his phonei hope you do a giveaway, with my wedding coming up my wife to be will only let me get this phone if i win itlol u are a apple lover !!!!!when a phone has more ram than your gaming laptop<a href=\"\">1:28</a> nicedex?yo i'm just going to wait until 2022 until the s20 ultra is being sold for $700man the audio in this is satisfying.these prices are just ridiculousthis phone has more ram than nasa had on all the apollo missons combined...its storage is also triple the storage the soyuz missions had available until the breakup of the soviet union...that camera thing on the back is hideoussamsung s20: zoom 100xiphone 12 : microscope<b>i doubt the battery would last even 15 hours. with 6.9&quot; screen and 200+ hz refresh rate, one would need power bank all the times</b>my only issue is for 1399 you have to provide more than 3 years of slow software updates. it's ludicrous at this point to think otherwise! -still want the phone thoughpretty much $1,000 of camera and $400 of actual phone. this is made for women who spent their lives taking pictures of themselves and their meals.why didn't they just add a pen and call this the note?still wanna know where he bought this shirti wanna know where he got this shirt, its dope.my samsung s8 plus phone is still best phone in the world.jordan 1it has 108 mp wide angle camera..u r wronggive away that phone to me pleaselens is irrelevant. it's the sensor that creates the quality and phones can only accommodate a teeny tiny sensor.so looks like samsung completed the oven rangerazer phone 2 had that display 1-2 years before the samsung s20 ultra!(watching on my razer phone 2)honestly the only thing i'm pissed about is the massive phone size.i wish the s20 ultra came in a 6.1 inch size or 5.9, my current s9+ is already hard to use with one hand.i wish phones were more small-hand friendly, shit fucking sucks.used to be something called a 7\" laptop...this one run autocad or archicad ?! or maybe catia ? loli'm not coming back!i got mines pre-ordered through an upgrade program so i'm getting the phone for like 800 because i can trade in my samsung s9+ to get a 100 discount + the extra 200 o2 is giving me and the phone is like 1,200 here in the uk.everytime a galaxy comes out :this is the best display evermaybe the phone should be called the \"s20 ultra flex\"i'm still running my galaxy s8, but shes getting slow and the battery drains faster these days. eyeing the s20+ probs keep it 4g toosounds and looks awesome, can't wait for it to hit the shelves!!!samsung: let's release a 1399$ phone to all these broke tech enthusiasts. us geeks that wanna support advancements in technology: well that wasn't very plus ultra of youdid not watch the other viddo you think that the s20 ultra will work fine with the osmo 3 gimbal?@marques: please upload the camera comparison with other flagships!!! this would great helpi have noticed that mkbhd from an impartial assessor had become iphone fan and samsung hater. i watch the videos because i hope he would get out of this enchantment but i notice the opposite - the enchantment goes deeper.huawei : 50x zoomsamsung : 100x zoomagain huawei : 500x zoomagain samsung : 1000x zoomapple : hold my 2x zoomwhen a phone gets better than your old shitty desktop pc, you might should upgrade your desktop pc :pcan you give me this mobile i must need thisipad will gonna be a pocket phonewhy don't you record 60fps for particular videos?please give me.......my contact no.+91-9993275521 please sirlots of phone tech is boring. what will i be doing with 16gb of ram on a phone? crappy isn't it!for me its ultralooks like a bad copy of iphone 11 proi actually did go watch the other video first loli watch you as technical guruji is a b*tch and always uploads in hindii can't wait to see phone in 10 years from now they are gonna be insaneyou could strap on a $8,000 dslr camera to and android and the snapchat quality will still be the same as an iphone 3gthis phone can produce 120hz (40 more than my monitor.)it has almost as much ram as my pc and it has 4k resolution. i might as well run bfv on a phone. or i should get a super computeruseless<a href=\"\">7:33</a> subscibed.. you mispelled subscribed :)honestly wish they would just let apple do their cameras for them just like they've been making screens for apple.wish i have one of that for freethe ipad mini was 4:3 . this is 400:9 hahahahawhere's the health sensor? the pulse oximeter sensor??oh, a lot of camera together that looks like it doesn't make me wanna puke.i will go from a samsung s8 to the s20+ i thinkim german and that camera can do 5x optical and 10x digital.them phone prices have gotten ridiculously too damn high. 20 years from now people will have to make a decision to buy a new or buy a new .8k vid when 4k ain't even mainstreamyou get 6.6 million views and the only test you do with the camera which is the highlight of the model is zooming in on a book hahashould i go for the s20 ultra it the iphone 11pro max? please reply16 gb ram and all the latest spec.. well.. does it have a 'snake' game like my nokia 3310?\"i don't know what you do with your periscope\"they copied apples camera designwe are now in the land of diminishing returns with phones, if you have the s9 or the s10 the update will not feel substantial.who else actually went and watched the video i clicked on this first because it had 108 megapixels in the title but mkbhd said go and watch the first one so i did and i am glad i did otherwise i probably wouldn't have understood it properlyloving my m30s...watching this on my iphone 7. i'm guud.yeh mkbhd ...........bhai bhai bhaimaybe the s20+ is the sweet spot but why don't you try xiaomi mi 10 proultra!!!!!nooooooo!!!! i need my edge display!!!instagram \"models\" everywhere are rejoicing & running out to get this phone. of course in payments.marques talking 'bout the 108 mpix kamera, and says: \"i've already made a whole video about this, and i'll link it below\"where do i find that link... or even better the video itself?<a href=\"\">1:18</a> materials are another same as s20 and s20+. s20 ultra have stainless steel frame same a iphone.this is not a phoneno phone jack - deal killersamsung is desperate to keep up on applethis guy is great. unbox therapy started doing loot crate scams and other forms of blatant cuckholdery so it looks like this is the spot nowthis is crazy af brosounds and looks amazing, so glad they have moved away from the waterfall edge and upped their camera game... but what does this ultra mean for the note?what you say about numbers is very true.i'm still super pleased with my galaxy a70.. i'm curious what will be out when it starts to fade on me..deez nuts goodem. <a href=\"\">1:34</a>officiall end of headphone jack *rip*.i'm going to wait for the final review to make my decision but i definitely need an upgrade.you haven't actually used this phone. everything you've just mentioned we can look up. sorry man but your review was now help. next time actually try the phone out.why 865 and not 855?arun's video on oppo reno 10x zoom too zoomed to moon. no no samsung, you're just motivating creepsters who spy!skip all the s20s go to the ultrapollii sadanamsamsung has been lazy for a while but man what is the point of this??? who is this even for? how does this even remotely make my life easier/better for 1400?the phone looks great but at that price there's no way. phone prices are really getting out of hand.with all these useless upgrades, we cant even use it to show off over youtube, instagram, facebook, etc coz all photos or videos doesnt support high resolution upload..no matter how good the hardware is but if they have junk processing software, camera will still suck!! biggesr regret is buying s9+ at launch instead of waiting for a couple of months for huawei p30 pro.hey marques, gime the phone for freethis or pixel 4 camera?samsung galaxy s20 ultra. how's the big battery treating?is there an \"e\" version again? i really want a smaller phone and not an ipad mini as you described.nice, but no! it's over kill. however it still looks awesome!100 times zoom is perfect for stalking lolis it a phone or a camera with a sim option .suck next look like note 10 lol are you f*<b>***</b> kidding me samsung s phones suckholy shittttt.....i wish i could afford this device one dayi want itheyyy...it look like iphone 11 camera !a 64 and 128mp camera with a 120hz quad hd screen and 128gb base storage etc. yeahhhh the new iphone is going to be shit in comparisonmay i ask where did you get that t-shirt? really cool! great reviewwhy don't you understand people. you guys compare latest 2020 flagship work last years iphone and declare a winner. but them releases their new 2020 iphone they become king again. lol sand for other companies hahahahahaahnow apple will release aphone for 2000$samsung runs the phone game, i dont know why everyone is so stuck on iphones.. i'm planning on getting this phone even if it's more expensive than the best iphone.. it's worth ithe: welcome backme: i didn't go nowhereplease make a zoom video$1400 but they are too cheap to put in a headphone jack.i wish i am also the one you to give me at least samsung s9 plus..my phone samsung s6 is broke it touch i can't use it properly and its too old. i want to use latest samsung flagship. i appreciate so much if you granted my wish..i am also your #1 huge fan always watching your youtube videos..good one..the best

seem the same.still not an iphonethe point is the price.. samsung exceeding their price apple will increase their price of 2020 models aswell then and everyone will just have fun in comments for the price but the truth is these prices are crossing their limits.. no phone makes sense of this price range.yo bring back the histogram shirtlol huawei. is bestiphone 6s's base storage was 16 gb. and that was just five years ago.can you do a review on the new galaxy buds +ultra100x zoom & 5000mah battery!! i hope it doesn't blow off. by the way, you guessed it right, i'm an iphone userwe need a

then came back to \"ok welcome back\" right on timei like your rainbow carpetdont tell me what to do, bitch!isn't it funny how they have such a massive jump in name from s10 to s20, yet it's the smallest innovation since the s series of phonesit doesnt automatically mean the camera us better but it is betterdo you allow to record 4k video longer than 5 minutes?the phones are fantastic yet i'm

itultradoes it have wireless powershare like the s10 and n10 did?unfortunately, samsung is still married to android. the only deal-breaker for all samsung phones in my opinion. if they made their own software and convinced google to let them do it, they would have tremendous changes. like iphones, things like snapchat and the front camera would feel extremely smooth. no matter how good the hardware is, there is always that \"android lag\" that feels disappointing.do a comparison vs the xiaomi mi 10 prowell shit. no more relying on samsung for the best phones while cheap.wait... why

the verizon network. by august after the note comes out i will make the decision.ugh. this thing is hemorrhaging gimmick after gimmick after gimmick. samsung doesn't care about making the ux awesome. they only care about what their devices look like on paper. it still has a tiny sensor so 108 megapixels is so useless. all it's doing is taking up farrrrrr more memory on your phone. or forcing you to pay for cloud storage, or buy a ton of extra physical memory for the thing. it isn't a well thought out execution and it's so obvious. instead of packing a device to the brim with crap like ram and megapixels they ought to think about how they can make their devices more optimized for a better experience.iphone 11pro max: no one can beat me samsung s20 ultra: hold my beer..subsribe my channel

devices. are you on apple's payroll? you should be grateful for how samsung is pushing technologies forward unlike apple. your reviews used to be neutral and informative which helped greatly in the

s20 ultra only 1150$i want that but idont have moneyi read that qualcomm modem x55 used in s20 series supports all bands of 5g frequencies i.e. low, mid and high bands. then, why is it that different models of s20 ultra are offering selected frequencies only for 5g. is the limitation due to the fact that different frequencies require different antennas in addition to the x55 modem and there is not enough space in the phone to accommodate all these antennas? but, i see no such limitation for 2g, 3g and 4g bands as s20 series is offering virtually all the bands for 2g to 4g. is it because only a few antennas are required for 2g to 4g?it's here, it's uglyno curved screen :(in india s20 ultra is cheaper than 11 pro..lolwhen is apple going to do something about iti had a 5100mah in the lenovo

country.\"the opening paragraph read:\"the chinese communist party (ccp) has seized power for seventy years. let us review it together.\"the subsequent text described the ccp's harvesting of organs from living falun gong practitioners and the final judgment of the independent china tribunal in london earlier this year.dutch national newspaper trouw carries a report entitled \"tribunal names china a criminal country\" on october 4.the article stated that the china tribunal's investigations were based on solid evidence and firsthand testimony.\"in order to get live organs and kill people, ccp doctors select organs when the victims are still alive,\" the author wrote.\"as early as 2006, there have been reports that the falun gong practice group is the main target. the ccp's live organ harvesting crimes from falun gong practitioners was confirmed by the tribunal. in addition, the china tribunal also suspects that an ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that the killing for organs also occurs on uighurs.\"my samsung s5 cam zoom donald trump from bosnia on toilet in white houseare you are about only the ultra having mmwave? i thought the plus had it too.fun fact: no one

they have considered this aspect.i will never pay to a phone more than 700 usd. no matter how much i earn. i think its really a waste since there will be better version coming next year.how ironic he

fuck marquesmarques can you please do a review on laptops that are suitable for students in 2020 please. thank you i appreciate it.man, these phones are getting crazy. i love galaxies, but for me it's still simple, i like small phones with my goddamned jack! phones are tools, they have to fit to my use and not the other way around.. so if new phones have 20 inch screens, fold 7 times and send signals to jupiter, awesome! but i still want screens that fit in my hand and headphones that don't need battery. call me crazy.i just got a new phoneultraultra or zjust got the note 10+, wish i didn't rush out to replace my dying iphone. done with apple, love owning my files!i'm at the point with smartphones that i would rather get something like nokia 7.2 because it has android one and it's good enough. i don't like bloat, and i don't honestly see any reason to get flagship phones anymore. and i have had flagship phones since iphone 4. i'm just regular phone user, though i like to customize my phone with nova launcher and such. i need battery life, decent camera and small bezels. unless you game on your phone, you just don't need massive performance. only games that need that amount of power are rpg and fps games and it's just crappy experience no matter how you go about it. there's literally no reason to get flagship aside from being amazed at it for a while and then you just do all the same things in it you could have done in your previous phone or some cheaper phone.i would buy samsung phones if they made android one versions, i would even be willing to even pay some extra. i think samsung still makes the best phones. though i don't think i would buy anything that's more than $600. as technology has gotten better, my priority has changed to os and price. because you can pretty much ignore specs and even low end phones have decent camera and small bezels.in marques we trustmaybe hacker could do something with the zoom<a href=\"\">6:25</a> the moment

bigi'll wait some 5 years until this technology becomes commonplace and affordablecmon bruh samsung isn't that bad they did perfect justice which iphone never thinks of. the price is perfect because these aint mi 108 cameras but they are samsung's. apple sells a phone at 1400$ with an 18 w charger. a note 10 or an s10 or oneplus 7t is a better buy then 11maxproall the phone upgrades of the last two years seems pointless to me except for higher refresh rates. i don't feel the desire to buy a new phone and my htc u11+ is from 2017. it's not only that i don't need it, i just don't want to, whereas with cars and clothes and watches it always happen to me that i'd like to buy more. phones used to feel the same way to me. i think that's a symptom of the smartphones companies not being able to offer significant functionality upgrades in the last two years.will apple in september able to show up?....this is big even though on paper...cupertino hope u have smthng up ur sleeve.what????. my laptop is 8gb ram and this phone is 16gb. oohh nooregular s20 is going to be my way to go.hilarious a bit when a phone gets 16gb ram while my pc still runs 4gb ram...hilariously painful though...well

blurry blobs. played with other features of phone for about an hour. difference in cpu speed was negligible. screen didn't look any more vibrant then the note 10 plus next to it. 120hz was good but screen lost some punch cuz well 1080p. not sure if there is a real need for 120hz as there isn't much for content that uses it. it seems more like a spec war like who's dick is bigger. compared some photos between s20 ultra and iphone 11 pro max and didn't see much of a difference. software is still same as note 10 plus. 16gb ram vs 12gb ram absolutely no difference. then looked at price tag and laughed hysterically. 2500.00!!!!! . wow samsung. you didn't just move up a bit you took a running jump. clearly isn't worth it full price. asked about financing and at 78 dollars a month this is ridiculous. gonna wait to see what comes out from other companies this year. cuz clearly i want to be able to afford a couple mortgage payments instead of marginal upgrade. this is my true unpaid review of the s20 ultra.not enough storage spaceeventually i understood. i will have to wait for the launch of galaxy s 40 and then i can afford this one.finally i can buy s7 now.\"so this brings us to the most important part of the phone... the camera. \". why do we even call it a phone anymore?? hahahaha2010: 3.5in display2020: 3.5in camera bumpi'm xs max user and bored, will take this s20 ultraapple: when did you come out with thissamsung: whenapple: yuhsamsung: no when did i askone day we gonna make a phone which has a fan,a mixer,a cooler,a oven,and a....a...bathtub everything in it.hole punch wtf? it's 2020 bruhso does this phone have the same restrictions for refresh rate as the non-ultra variants? you edited in a clip for them, but not sure if it applies to the phone with more ramneed advice. i got a student discount so i can get the s20+ for around 800 usd and the ultra for 1050$. i don't really need the 100x zoom but i think it's a pretty good deal?no more bixby button? sold!!!#3 on trending! they keep on adding more cameras (its going to look iike an octopus one day), keep on making the screen bigger ( will be a wacom tablet one day)... but they should; focus on screen durability so we can rock these cool cell designs without cases, they should develop a all in one camera, they should focus on making the batteries thinner but with larger capacities... you know... they should push the envelope and create! yet... they just add more cameras, usually use the same battery capacities, fragile materials... boringggggggggggggggggggg!future : full of cameras in the back with 5000 mega pixel camerano thank you, im gonna stick with my s9 lmao.the most ridiculous specs i've ever heard...huawei/xiaomi : makes zoom phonessamsung: makes zoom phonesthen apple comes and creates their own and calls it new and innovative\n",
